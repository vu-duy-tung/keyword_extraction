The burger was good and the sauces great, but the bun on one was soggy and the bun on another one was dry.  The onion rings were just o.k.   The milk shake was good, but we didn't get it until half was through our meal.  By the way, we were only one of three tables in the place, so you can't say they were really busy.  The service was borderline - the place wasn't particularly clean and the help wasn't very welcoming.  Overall, I probably wouldn't try again.",

I knew it was mine because it was a special order, and I watched as it sat for TEN minutes before they finished cooking the rest of the  order and brought it to the table. I watched the couple next to us get one burger, five minutes later their fries and a few minutes after that the 2nd burger. I am  sure Bobby would be horrified. It wasn't that great that we would go back.",

Great atmosphere Great Service Great Food ... Honestly this was the best burger fry onion ring and shake combo I have ever had...Ever... Tried all the sauces with the fries... The consistency and flavor of the Coconut shake was perfect... The meat was cooked perfectly and the overall flavored were amazing ... These should go in all major cities across the USA...

I took my wife here because she wanted to eat at a Bobby Flay restaurant.  Well, to be exact, the bathroom is why I am posting.  It was the worst bathroom I have ever seen.  The urinal was overflowing.  I just pee'd right on the floor next to the drain vent.  Why? well, because it looked like someone had given the toilet a \"spray-on tan\" if you know what I mean.  I'm not trying to be crass, but I should have posted a pic of it on Bobby's twitter account.  I bet someones head would have rolled.  That picture would have gone viral due to the unbelievable level of sanitation.  As far as excellent burgers go...1. Ho-dads in San Diego (Single Bacon Cheeseburger ).   2. Burgers and Beer in Willoughby, OH (Jalapeno and pepper jack stuffed burger).   3.  The Grind in Phoenix, AZ (Nogales Burger ).",

They give you a number for your order and you place it on the table and they bring your order to you. I got the Palace Classic with no onion and add a fried egg with a side of Undecided (fries and onion rings). My boyfriend got the Bobby Blue with no lettuce or tomato with a side of cheese fries. I LOVED my burger. It was perfectly cooked. The egg was so gooey that I had to eat my burger with a fork! Awesome! My boyfriend liked his burger, however, there was a weird gravy like sauce on it that he did not like. The cheese fries were crazy good.",

    "text": "I'll start this off by saying that my rating for this place is really 3.5 and if we received our burgers cooked correctly it would have been a solid 4.   This place is super casual and it's a True burger bar. You order as you walk in and the menu is straight forward. Burgers, shakes (regular or spiked), salads and sides. There's also this thing called \"get crunchified\" for FREE and they'll put crispy potato chips on any burger for you. They also offer \"the undecided\" for anyone who can't make up their mind on which sides to try and want to split different ones. I thought these touches were very cool.   After you order you seat yourself anywhere that's open.   We ordered a crunchburger that came with American cheese and potato chips on it and a brunch burger with a fried egg, bacon & American cheese. We were also undecided on the sides so we chose onion rings and sweet potato fries. We ordered medium burgers but received well done ones. That always sucks because we really enjoy juicy patties. My egg was also well done and no runny yolk :( Didn't send them back because it was late and we were really hungry and exhausted. To the positives, the burgers were very flavorful as Bobby is known for that and everything was well proportioned. The onion rings were cut quite large and I prefer smaller cuts as its always a pain in the ass to bite into them but the batter was also falling apart before you could get it into your mouth. Sweet potato fries were great, at least the ones on top that were nice and crispy but everything beneath them was mushy as they sat around too long in a narrow container and couldn't breathe.   I'm a huge fan of Mesa Grill and I know that Bobby has the skills so I hope someone can come in here and make a few tweaks and regroup the kitchen staff. The flavor profiles are great but the execution needs some work.",

Service is always very good - very friendly and helpful staff. Food is brought out promptly and well prepared.   My most recent visit was no different. Two circa 5th grade friends were in town for a girls weekend (aka BAEcay because we crack ourselves up...) and staying on the strip.   We had a round of their prickly pear margaritas....because hot pink!  The server said not to let the color fool us, because they weren't sissy drinks...he was correct. I love the color, and they don't skimp on the tequila. I usually order one each time I go. They don't necessarily taste much different than a traditional frozen margarita, but I am a sucker for prickly pear flavored anything.   Our burgers were great, I believe everyone in the group was pleased...I was too busy people watching and inhaling my burger to notice if they weren't. I like the burger with the chiles and white American cheese, and I crunchify it, I can't remember we what it's called but unless the burger of the month can't be resisted, that's my standard order. The fries are always great too- started out ordering them to share but have since learned my lesson on that...get your own fries!   Best burger in Las Vegas? Nah...best celebrity chef burger on the strip? I feel comfortable saying yes.   And locals - they have a loyalty card!",

But for the price I expected to be blown away by the best burger ever. And I can honestly say id rather go to In-N-Out if I was down in this area of the strip. Not bad if you decide to pop in, and it's cool that they have fountain drink free refills. But if you go here, despite being namsaked after a celebrity chef, the food is average, with an above average price.",

The price is a bit high but you do get a quick good burger.  The bathroom is protected by a code but it still was a dirty mess.  Order a fountain soda and not a bottle (same price) as you can get refills and the soda machine is self serve.  To the staff and management please keep it this way as it is one of the reasons I stop in for a quick lunch.  If you looking for more of a meal (dinner) I suggest looking at Gordon Ramsey's burger place as it is more of a sit down meal and not a quick eat.",

I would say they used at least a 7oz patty. For under $10 bucks you really are getting good value for your money. Hand cut fries as well which I always appreciate. Huge amount and a small was more than enough. Plenty of dipping sauces which I always love.  Parking- Use Valet at the Mandarin Orient for easy access. It's right out the back door and I wish I would of known that before I made the trek. Other than that you're on foot to get to this location. Stayed at the Cosmopolitan so I had a 20 minute walk, up and down pedestrian bridges. Not the fun nest walk when full and in a food coma. Lol.. Also, I spoke to the waitress who says she parks at Aria for close walk.",

It was filthy, even the places to sit which had apparently been \"cleaned\" had ketchup, food, and other trash.  It took quite a while to place an order as the persons taking the orders kept leaving and one elderly lady was really complaining about \"they needed to come out of the back and help\" and then just left as we approached to give our order.  I ordered the burger cooked medium and when it arrived the bun was covered in blood and grease.  It was cooked rare.  Even rare it was very greasy.   Rather than send it back I ate it.  About the only redeeming value was the milk shake and onion rings were good.",

The meat should be delicious.  My burger tasted like a dry overcooked hockey puck.  The burger itself was dry and tasteless, and it was served on a bed of lettuce which was to have a balsamic dressing.  Unfortunately they either forgot the dressing, or put so little on, that it couldn't be detected.  The waitresses did bring dressing upon request, but it should not have been served like this.  I would take a pass on Bobby Flay's burger.",

I pointed out that they should have told me that when I ordered since it was a main ingredient of the salad. She then blamed her co-worker for not telling us they ran out. She did offer to get me something else instead but at that point it had been a half hour since I ordered and they were about to close so I just ate it as it was.

I would give it 5 stars however the potato chips were a big negative. He seems to want to put potato chips on the sandwiches. What are you trying to hide ? That may be fine but when you order french fries on top of it that seems like a bit of potato overload. By the way the French fries are excellent as well. The onion rings are not quite excellent however. They are fresh and a nice size but the batter is too highly seasoned.   I wish they would offer just a simple plain old burger without all the fixins that their preset sandwiches come with. Every burger place should have this option for those purists who want to focus on the taste of the meat. I will return. I think he's got the best burger around. If only you could get it without all the stuff on it. I'm sure they would do it if you asked but it shouldn't be that way. They should offer a sandwich that truly showcases the meat. And his meat is delicious.",

We got the Las Vegas (which has BBQ chips inside of it) and the New Mexico (Which had red serrano peppers.....amazing). The onion rings were super HUGE.... You get four, but I don't really like how you have to eat them. All in all pretty darn good for the price!",

    "text": "In Las Vegas this past Monday and wanted to try this place. If you know Bobby Flay's strengths they are in quality ingredients and he is the master of sauces and flavors. I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. He has about 10 burgers on the menu and my wife and I tried three, all were outstanding, the Palace Classic, Bobby Blue and Philly.  All three were excellent however, the Palace Classic was the clear winner. This burger is simple in it's execution, the beef is fresh and seasoned perfectly however not pressed to a thinness that is overwhelmed by the bun, the beef is the star believe it. By simply adding to the supurbly cooked beef patty American cheese, lettuce, tomato and a slice of red onion on a sesame seed bun that holds together better than most, the Burger sauce, Chipotle sauce only enhance the flavor of the burger. It's amazing what Bobby can do to a burger,  probably one of the two best I've had period. Add a Vanilla Caramel Bourbon shake and it's simply magic. The manager, Sean keeps this place running smoothly and he engages with customers easily and he represents the brand well.  If Bobby opens one of these in Hawaii, Teddy's Big Burgers, Five Guys or any of the others will have a problem as his product is superior in quality, taste, execution and to top it off, after eating you just get up and walk out, the staff clears your table for you. Suggestion, if you are in Las Vegas and want a burger this is the place to go period.",

I ordered the Bobby Blue because they did not have any mushrooms in the building and couldnt make my mushroom/swiss burger. Odd that there were no mushrooms in the house.  My wife ordered the Brunch Burger. Again our expectations were high. My burger was bland, needed seasons g and small. The burger had slid off the bun before i received it and the blue cheese melted off the burger and was on the plate in its entirety, none left on the burger. There was one small piece of lettuce, one small piece of onion barely discernable. I ordered the sweet potato fries and they were very good.   My wifes Brunch Burger was good. Again we were excited to try a Bobby Flay burger. Her cheese fries were cold and had to be sent back.   We had milkskakes for dessert and they were unbelievable. Bobby change it to a Shake Shop instead of burger joint. Your place couldnt hold a candle to Stripe Burgers in the Elara Shop area.",

I came in with my boyfriend today at about 4:30 for a quick bite since we were staying right next door at Aria and also I'm a fan of Bobby Flay. The \"manager\" (and I use quotes because we'll, I'm using that word loosely) was sitting next to us, not working but instead talking to a tall dark handsome customer who I'm pretty sure she knew. The ENTIRE time we were eating our meal, we sat there listening to her loudly talk shit about the employees and as well her manager. Apparently her manager wanted her help to rent a party bus of sorts but then he backed out and now he's an ass for doing that.. According to her. After she gave him the price he told her it was too expensive and didn't want it but her opinion was, why take your family on vacation if you can't afford it. STFU! It's not your place to say those things and you work in a fucking $10 burger joint so don't act like you have room to tell other people how to spend their money. Also, I had to eat my meal listening to her tell the other customer/friend how one of the workers is lazy and she always has to keep an eye on him. That's fine, but any manager with a little sense in their head would know to not do that in front of customers who are trying to eat their lunch. I was really turned off by how unprofessional she was and it's sad that the other workers have that kind of a person they have to answer to...or that they're being talked about behind their backs In front of customers by their manager ..how embarrassing.   Brunette manager working Saturday 9/20 afternoon shift get a grip! I was 2 seconds away from telling you off but my boyfriend stopped me, thank god for your sake... You need to be embarrassed just like you did to your workers. You really struck a nerve and I hope this review comes back to you. These 2 stars go out to you. Set a fucking example.",

I had the blue cheese burger and the flavor was good but temperature was off.   We also ordered the bacon, cheese fries. Also arrived cold. Bacon was good. Cheese flavorless.   And lastly the cookies and cream milk shake was delicious (and cold).   Why not send the food back? First it took a long time for the food to come out the first time. It's Vegas we were hungry and didn't want to spend anymore time at the restaurant then we needed to.   It was disappointing. Probably won't return. Many other choices to find a high end burger on the Strip and hopefully better then BBP.",

It was something new to have potato chips on my burger, but it was really good.  My husband had the brunchburger which is perfect for anyone opting out of the potato chips and who also enjoy breakfast foods.  We had an order of cheese fries as well, plentiful for 2 people to share.  No cheese was spared, there was plenty and it was super delicious.  Overall I was very pleased and I would eat there again.",

The selections are straightforward, except for the potato chip \"twist\".  That reminded me of when I used to put corn chips in my tuna sandwiches when I was a kid!  Nice flashback for me!  The regular and sweet potato fries were not fried enough though so they were a bit too soggy for our tastes.  We liked the idea of walking up to place our order and sitting anywhere you want to wait for your food to be delivered.  It's a simply decorated spot that can remind you of a modern diner.  Nice idea/concept but work on the fries!",

On the cooking scale, if you normally get a medium rare, ask for it medium, it'll come out medium rare.  I had a medium rare burger that was very rare.  I was too hungry to care though.  The sweet potato fries tasted a little raw still.  But overall, the burgers were a good idea. Just needs to stay on the grill a little longer.",

    "text": "Really quite disappointing. I am a big fan of Bobby Flay, and have watched him on the Food Network for years so when my trip to Vegas came up I had to come here and was looking forward to eating at one of my favorite chef's places. I'd gone back and forth in my mind on what to order and decided on the Dallas burger which is a spiced rubbed burger, bbq sauce, coleslaw which I got on the side,  cheese and pickles with an order of onion rings. I came with my family and we all ordered something different and everything came out in pieces. 1 burger first, then my dad's shake, then my onion rings and fries, then my mom and sisters lemonade then finally the four other burgers. My dad was very disappointed in his strawberry shake and just from looking at the shake, it wasn't presented well, it came in a plastic  cup with the saddest tiniest amount of whipped cream so that was a no go. I munched on my onion rings while waiting for my burger and they were huge and perfectly cooked but had absolutely no flavor at all not even salt. My burger was really good,  the meat was well seasoned,  the cheese, pickles and bbq sauce was good and the coleslaw added a nice cool crunch so they hit the mark and I ate my burger with the jalepeno hot sauce which was so good! Where this place falls short is the overall ambiance. I wasn't expecting five star decor but for 95 dollars worth of food I'd like my food on something other than cafeteria plates, better shakes and for goodness sakes if your not making your lemonade in house hide the bottle of the manufacturer your using! My dad got out of his seat for something and saw someone pouring a bottle of simply lemonade into a cup for my mom and my sister. A place like this I would expect to make their own lemonade but i'm not naive and know this is common place in restaurants but it should be the same price as a fountain drink not more. I was expecting more overall and it didn't quite deliver for me so I can't say I'll be back,  but you still my boy Bobby!",

BBP is definitely a tourist trap.   tips: *restroom available *high chair available *free refills as its fountain drinks *cash and credit card accepted *indoor seating only *the bobby stands for bobby flay. *you can request chips on any of your burgers at no additional cost",

I came came into this place with high hopes considering Bobby Flay is definitely my favorite chef next to Gordon Ramsay. I was hoping he would not put his name on anything that was below his own standards.   I ordered a beef burger and requested it to be cooked \"medium.\" The patty was dry, dryer than Bobby Flay's sense of humor. The patty was flaky which isn't what I look for in a bun. I expected some soft BUNS. I tried my hardest to use the sauces on the table to save the burger but it still failed to impress.   For 10 dollars I would take my money to Fatburger across the street. I appreciate the servers but they need to get someone new in that kitchen or he should take some time to teach them properly. Bobby Flay, you have been \"chopped.\"",

It wasn't horrible, but for a chef like Bobby Flay, I would expect that he would only put out an amazing burger. It seemed like it was missing flavor and the bun was just okay. I've actually eaten a better burger at cheap fast food places like In N Out or Burger King. I tried 2 of the burgers, the BBQ Cole slaw one and the green chili one...just not thrilled with either. Still on the hunt for an amazing Las Vegas burger!",

This place is very 'fast food' and the prices are totally out of whack. Also, you carry a big plastic number to your seat so an apathetic teenager can dump the food in front of you. To top it off, the burger is mediocre at best.  Never going back here.",

You walk up to the counter, order your food, find your seat, then it's brought to your table. Although Bobby Flay is a celebrity chef, his staff is unpretentious. My sources tell me that when this restaurant first opened, Flay was serving all his patrons and taking pictures.   My friends ordered the LA burger with bacon and cheddar fries. I ordered the Carolina burger and regular cheese fries. We washed it all down with pistachio, strawberry and blueberry-pomegranate shakes.  The prices here were not astronomical, even though this is a celebrity chef restaurant.   Next time, I will get my burger crunchified!",

I guess I am not a big fan of onion rings anyway.  Not really enough french fry sauce to dip in.  You must remember that it's a burger joint and not fine dinning.

It was 11:25pm and we were leaving MGM so I said to them- let me call and see what time they are open until. I called and a girl , who was clearly dead inside, said midnight, so I said - great! We are coming now!!! Yay!!!! And she said \"uhhuh\" and hung up. So we made it through the seas of humans as if it were the running of the Bulls, us being the bulls, and we got there at 11:35. There was no one at the counter for five minutes, and meanwhile two more groups of people came in after us so there are about 12 people just standing and waiting.  I finally found an employee with her back turned to me, I said \"excuse me\" 3 times until she finally turned around and I pointed to the registers and I said we've been waiting for about seven minutes and there is no one there. She went and got someone else who finally took our orders. I was first. I ordered two different burgers because I couldn't decide, I knew I would eat one and take one home. I ordered the Carolina burger with extra cheese (smoked american sounded really unique and delicious to me) and the girl enters in extra smoked cheddar- I asked why she did that and she said because that's what it comes with and that's what you asked for. The menus are everywhere- in giant font! I said no, it co ew with smoked American and she said no it doesn't. I said read the menu, please. She said oh. I think this was dead inside girl. Anyway, my friends ordered along with the other two groups of people and we all sat down . There were people who had still been eating inside as well. Everyone was served their food, but me- which, hello- I was first. Half way through eating, all of a sudden the music was blasting so loudly that we couldn't hear each other speak, and again, Ihad to say \"excuse me\" to that same girl who doesn't like to be bothered, and my friend said- what's with the loud music? It's so rude, and she went and turned it down.  Again, we were not the only people in there.  The next day, I called and asked for a manager. I told her what happened and she was VERY apologetic. She said that she would like to send me a gift card worth three meals. I said that I appreciate that very much and I get that stuff happens, but it's how management deals with it after, so I thanked her .  THE GIFT CARD NEVER CAME AND ITS BEEN THREE WEEKS.  I do not appreciate being treated like a joke, and I am utterly disgusted.",

New Mexico turkey burger was delicious, onions rings even more so. Got the undecided half and half with fries which meant only 3 onions rings which was unexpected but our awesome server Enzo fixed that - giving us a couple more on the house. Also our cashier gave us a free drink. Was a good decision to try something new!",

I went in with my kids on a Friday in the early evening. It was super mellow which is great for me, no long lines or waits. Service from the get go was mediocre at best. I don't want to drag on about the numerous things that were wrong but the most important is the food. To start they got my order wrong, fries were great, burgers were over cooked and dry. Ordered my burgers medium and they came out well done (why bother asking for a temp if you're going to get a cooked-thru fast food anyway). Overall it was Nothing special. When I left I genuinely felt ripped off. Two burgers (one topless), fries, 2 lemonades, and one margarita (happy hour price) with tip came out to $50. I have zero problem dropping good money for quality food. My philosophy is: \"you get what you pay for\", but this place really left me annoyed.",

I usually keep it simple and stick with a traditional Crunchburger...just cheese and potato chips as toppings and I'll add the different sauces provided at the tables as I eat. Nothing fancy just good quality. Burgers are always consistent. Shakes are awesome, tried a pistachio one for the first time today. A little confused why this place only has 3 1/2 stars...staff has always been great to us and we've never had a bad food experience. Nothing but love, here! Thanks, Bobby!",

    "text": "After attending a nearby Yelp event, a few yelpers decided it was time for a burger. I heard Bobby Flay, burgers and beer....I was sold!   I was instantly impressed with the layout of this joint. The tables were in a semi \"S\" shaped style, which made for interesting dining. The tables were large and held about 10 people. The entire setup of the restaurant was fun and creative. No one walked away from our table a stranger.   The line was long but went quickly. We waited less than 5 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we placed our order. I approached the cashier knowing exactly what I wanted. I was quick to order and to pay.   The Bill: $22.16.....ehhh  The Brunch Burger - certified Angus beef, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I like my meat a little pink to keep the flavor so I ordered medium. The burger was nicely cooked but on your typical sesame seed bun. The egg and bacon was amazing, really who could argue with a fried egg and smoked bacon?? The burger was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  Not sure it was worth the $9.50, but I knew walking in I was paying for the name behind the burger.   The Half and Half - you can order one side for $4 each or combine 2 sides for $5. You have the option to get french fries, sweet potato fries or beer battered onion rings. I decided to go for the the regular fries, with the all amazing BBP Fry Sauce and the Beer Battered Onion Rings. The fries were tasty, crisp and all around the perfect fries. No complaints. I was a little disappointed to only see 2 onion rings come with the half and half. I mean really, those rings were perfect and you're going to tease me with only 2?   Beer - Miller Lite. Yes, BBP has its own decent selection of beers, drinks, wines spiked milkshakes and margaritas, I stuck to my roots and went with a Miller Lite. After all, they didn't have PBR.   Overall, the food was good but nothing about it stood out to make my mouth water as I write my review. The staff checked on us regularly and even made sure we all had beers when we were getting low. Just because of the experience, friendliness of the staff and my urge to try more burgers on the menu, I will probably return.",

So I've been to BBP in Philadelphia, NY, NJ and DC and all of them are pretty consistent on their \"service\". Which brings me to Las Vegas and is why it gets a 3 star rather than the 4 I would give the others. Maybe it's management but the employees don't seem as motivated as the other locations.  The food was still to standard. I found that they've added the brunch burger and the Vegas? to the menu. I always lean towards the LA burger \"crunchified\" with the sweet potato fries (BECAUSE THE ONION RINGS ARE HORRIBLE) and that darn chipotle ketchup. There were many times that I've been close to stealing a bottle of it.  What I do think is a flaw is the tipping process throughout the chain. Since there's no tip line on the card receipts, the staff relies on cash. We, as customers, refill our own drinks and help ourselves to the condiments when they aren't around which makes us feel like we don't really have to tip the 20% for server \"unnamed\". That will be all.",

    "text": "Seeing the affiliation with Bobby Flay immediately sparked my interest, but Bobby's Burger Palace just barely lived up to its namesake. Although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh, the burger was not anything extraordinary.   My boyfriend had the Vegas burger, which was definitely more unique with red chilies and BBQ chips that gave an extra crunch. I ordered the LA burger with chicken breast, which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings. The chicken was cooked really well, but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese. Somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom, so I was holding onto mush by the end of my burger. Overall, the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special. We also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries, which came with great dipping sauces (chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce). They also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries, including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeno sauce.   If you're looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the Strip, Bobby's Burger Palace can tide you over for a little bit, but I would recommend checking out other more noteworthy spots when you're in a city filled with amazing food.",

Hope this does not degrade the quality of the product over the long haul. For now, the one we have on the east coast that I frequent and this one both serve a #1 burger, so consistency is good in this case.   I love the slathered on Avocado relish L.A. Burger. Nothing else needed; no ketchup, mustard or other sauce to muddy the taste the chef designed. I wanted to try a \"Spiked Milkshake\" but that sounded like a stand-a-lone meal order or a good hangover cure type order, price $9 bucks. Next time perhaps.   There was no line when I ordered but by the time I left, about 20 minutes, the line was out the door, at noon. Plan ahead.",

    "text": "The name of Bobby's Burger Palace reminds me of that TV show Bobby's World for some reason.  That has nothing to do with this restaurant or review, but whatever.  My friend & I were in Vegas for the weekend.  We had plans Sunday night, but of course we wanted to grab a bite to eat first. We didn't have a ton of time, and since we were staying near Bobby's and Yelp reviews were pretty good, we decided to try it out.  We walked in and the line wasn't too long. It was a little slow, but I was being indecisive on what I wanted anyway, so this gave me a little time to figure out what I wanted.  The burgers are on the gourmet (if you will) side (though you can get something more simple, I'm sure).  I opted for the Bobby Blue -- blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, & tomato -- crunchified (with potato chips on it).  I always order sweet potatoes when they're an option, so that was my side.  I wanted to try a spiked milkshake but didn't; maybe next time!  After ordering, you take your number and can pick your own seat (They do have carryout as well.).  The decor is clean and bright; I really enjoyed the look of the place.  We sat down, and our food came out as ordered in a timely fashion. After taking a quick picture of my burger for Yelp, I dug in.... and it hit the spot!  The sweet potato fries were on point, and the burger was exactly what I wanted. It was how I ordered it (crunchified and well done).  The chips were a fun addition.  Overall, we had a great experience and meal at Bobby's Burger Palace. I would gladly go back here.  If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive (compared to other places nearby), good, and quick meal, this fits the bill.  It seemed like there might be a little room to grow and the line did take a little time, so I docked a star. Still--I really enjoyed my meal here.",

We ordered a slew of burgers to try the same as last time for research of course  first up the Dallas which is his Texas burger is still great I think the bbq sauce has changed since last I had it but it still rocks. Now my wife ordered his veggie burger which I hate mushrooms but that burger was good it would be better without all the bread but it was surprisingly good.The brunch burger, the egg runny so good. Now, if you know me, I don't care for French fries at all and should have gotten chips just on G.P cause I am a potato chip person not fries, so I didn't like them then and now but the onion rings are really good. The L.A. burger which I got for my wife she loves guacamole but it needs more guac in her opinion, it wasn't my favorite, I don't care much for guac. The Philly was ok but when I was in Philly I wasn't impressed about the real thing, meaning philly cheese steak, but this version I can hang with this. The New Mexico burger is spicy and delicious . I like everything bobby so I will come back but I hope it's not in 6-7 yrs.",

When my friend had questions, the cashier wasn't helpful nor friendly throughout ordering. However, another worker was really friendly as he gave us our food.  When we ate our burgers, we both agreed that they were too salty. The beef was good quality, but overpowered with the salt that I could not finish my burger. The shake was okay at best, a bit too liquidy, but probably the best thing we had. Fries were okay aswell, but also a bit too salty.  I did like the interior and the vibe.  Not sure if it was just a bad night? However, I wouldn't recommend this place and personally wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "I wasn't too impressed my last visit with the burgers being just ok in my opinion. I stated in my last review I would return to give it a second chance sometime in the future. Well the future is here!   Almost four years later me and my friends stopped in to grab burgers. The burgers or burger I ordered tasted ten times better than the last, somewhat making me eat my words. That tends to happen sometimes haha.   The Louisiana is the burger I chose. We ordered at the register then grabbed seats at the bar for a round of beers. James was the bartender who took care of us that night. Really cool guy with good knowledge of the beers on tap. He poured me up a Sculpin stating you're not going to find this anywhere on tap at this price. After thinking about it for a few seconds I agreed. I wasn't going to get a Sculpin on tap anywhere under $5, nowhere I knew of at least. Shortly after joking it up with James, the food arrived.   In contrast to the last burger I had here, this one was juicy and its patty well seasoned. The pepper jack was nicely melted, the slice of tasso ham on top of the patty was crispy and the burger was completely sauced up with both spicy remoulade & red hot sauce adding more flavor to the meats.   This was a huge improvement in taste and quality. Sadly it was a burger of the month, not one of the permanents on the menu. Sucks because it was delicious. Me joking with James I told him about my experience with the New Mexico burger and stated Bobby Flay should toss that one and put the Louisiana in it's place. Jame's response...\"hey hey, don't you go knocking the New Mexico. What kind of a mad man are you?\" My response...\"ok ok, maybe I'm being too harsh on that state. I'll give them a chance for redemption next time\" haha. Mentioning it again, James was cool and offered some good laughs. You have to have heard it in the tone he used upon saying it which made it hilarious.   I plan to give the New Mexico another shot just to be sure. However I am looking forward to another burger of the month. Hopefully any burger I order in the future (burger of the month or permanent) will be as enjoyable as this one.   Dinner 2/11/2018",

Bobby's burger place is right by Aria within walking distance before you even get to New York New York so we thought we'd stop by.   It is walk up service as in your order the moment you walk in the door which is super easy if you're looking for something laid back like this.  The girl taking our order was super friendly asking us where we were from, telling us her recommendations of the menu, etc.   The place itself was very clean and tidy. I did use the restroom when I was here and this is why i'm giving it 4 stars because it wasn't the cleanest I've seen and all the floor were so sticky it was disgusting.   The decor inside is super bright with each wall being painted a bright color whether it be green or orange!   Every burger does have the option to get it \"cruched\" for free! Which means adding potato chips to the burger which I admit does give it an added flair and it takes me back to when I was 10 and I always did this with my family grilling out.   I got the basic cheeseburger it was delicious, not greasy one bit, the onion and lettuce I got on it was super fresh and the bun itself was soft and not your boring lame bun you can buy in the grocery store.   We just got burgers although next time around, i'd be tempted in ordering a shake also, they had a huge selection and the person next to us got one and it looked amazing. Even served with whipped cream up top.   For our two burgers it was just over $20 which is pretty good for Vegas and you don't have to tip here since you do refill your own drinks.",

My favorite is beat bobby Flay where contestants compete to make dishes that will or will not beat Bobby's.    This restaurant is located near the veer towers and Mandarin condominiums in Las Vegas. It is outside on a side street without parking. You may park in a parking garage somewhere on the strip and walk here. You can't miss it, the sign has a colorful bright rainbow lettering.    The food: there are various burgers on the menu which is what this place is known for. Their burgers are unique in that, they put potato chips inside the burger. They call these burgers crunch burgers. I typically order their original crunch burger which contains: a beef patty, sesame buns, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onions and a layer of potato chips. The cheese is an American cheese; however, you may substitute the cheese for Swiss, cheddar or other types. You can also add in extra bacon, avocado or other types of toppings. I personally wouldnt want to pay extra for these. The burger is standard on the menu and is good on its own. I felt that the burger was on the greasy side. It leaked with oil as I took a couple bites. The last time I came here, the burger was less oily. There are also other salads and other various items, but I have never tried them.   The price: the burgers are about $8-11. I found them to be moderate in price. The fries are separate and are about $5 depending on what kind you want. You can choose to have cheese on these fries or bacon bits. You may customize it to your liking but will cost quite a bit more.    The service: above average. I felt that the servers served the food well and the food came out in about 5-10 minutes. You are also able to see the people cooking your food.    The inside: it is unique. The tables are curved like a snake and the lighting is also curved. There are condiments on the tables like salt, pepper and other various sauces. There is another section where there are television sets and a bar station for alcoholic drinks. The lighting in this area is different. It is moderate to noisy during the night and there are no bathrooms available. The wifi is not free here too. Overall, my experience here was good. The burgers are pretty greasy and the fries cost extra. The prices were pretty moderate for me so if you want affordability, this place barely cuts it. Good place to take a significant other on a date? Yes, this place caters to couples. May I take my family here? Yes.",

I am so mad at myself for not trying on other of occasions, but I am fully educated now and its all good. Lesson learned.  Now lets move on to the food, after placing our order and sitting down at there fantastic little chairs that take me back to when I would visit a diner and eat with my parents. There lobby is so comfy with large green chairs the patron is seated at a counter and you can sit across from each other.   Finally, the food as promised: I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was so juicy that it melted in my mouth. Writing this review makes my taste buds yearn for another. The burger evokes an emotional response it is so tasty and delicious. My twins ordered the chip burgers and the same dance happened with their meat in my mouth but just with lays chips in union. Also ordered a chocolate and strawberry shake. The chocolate shake was a dark chocolate and was better than the strawberry, it chocolate you know. Their fries and onion ring sampler are awesome as well. Now we all must go and satisfy our cravings for burgers.",

JAMES is the best waiter in the place. I was going to see Bobby to tell him myself, but sadly he was absent. Bobby needs to know that James is reppin' his burgers hard. Put James on your show. This is not the first time we have graced BBP while in Las. Bobby you need to meet James. He's got your burger back...  all good things. Best burger in the world. No lies. Also the only reason to stay at the Waldorf is the direct access to BBP. Otherwise stay at the Four Seasons.. side note but worth mentioning.",

It's really what you'd imagine it would look like.  We decided on the bacon crunch burger. We split the burger and they were awesome with cutting it and giving us an extra plate.  That being said. It was too salty with the bacon and potato chips. I'm a salt fiend and it was too salty for me I'm not really a complainer but the rag buckets and broom by our table was a bit off putting .  Other than that the place is great and the staff was friendly.",

Our orders included the brunch burger, the chicken crunchburger, regular fries, and bacon cheese fries.  Admittedly I screwed up when ordering (am lactose intolerant, forgot to ask for no cheese), but the server was gracious in fixing my mistake!  This alone is worth a 5* review, to say nothing about the delicious food.  As a Coloradan, beer taps in Vegas are almost always disappointing, but it was nice to see a few beers not carried in bulk on the strip (sure, I am happy to drink Rebel IPA and Lagunitas IPA, but do these HAVE to be the only craft beers consistently available on the strip!?) - the Ballast Point draft was refreshing!  Staff was quite friendly, accommodating, and the burgers were delicious.  Fun, bright layout, and worth a visit by any Vegas-goer!",

    "text": "This was my first time eating at a Bobby Flay restaurant, and I'm glad we decided to go the casual route as opposed to something more upscale like Mesa Grill.   We could tell from Yelp pictures that the seating is communal (a severe anxiety for my introverted husband), so we made sure to be here when they opened which worked out tremendously as we had nearly a whole seating area to ourselves.   You order at the counter and it was by far the cheapest meal we had during our trip. For two giant burgers, a side order of fries/rings, a margarita, and a fountain drink, the total came to a little more than $40.    A friendly server came by to explain the table sauces and brought our food out about 10 or so minutes later. The sauce I remember most was the chipotle ketchup because it was AMAZING! I would put that on just about anything.   My husband had the cactus pear margarita which I took a sip of and thought was just okay. The color was beautiful but it had an odd chalky taste. Everything else about the meal however was perfection.   He ordered the Dallas burger medium while I had the LA burger medium well without tomatoes. The LA burger has a delicious avocado relish, watercress, and cheddar cheese. We both made sure to get our burgers crunchified which is their signature style of simply putting potato chips on top. It adds great texture and kick of salt to each bite. How did I never think to add potato chips to my burgers before? Genius. And the best part is it's free of charge!  The sides here are generous so one will be enough for two to share. We wanted both fries and rings so the indecision was great. They served them with chipotle mayo and garlic ranch dipping sauces that were both divine.  This completely lived up to the celebrity chef hype for me. We splurged on other meals while in town that paled in comparison to the overall dining experience we had here (both in terms of price and food). Awesome place and I will 100% be back again next time Vegas and I cross paths. I really want to try one of those incredible looking shakes too.   Side note- Be sure to ask the cashier for the code to the bathroom if needed. They are for customers only and the door won't open without keying it in.",

    "text": "So, I'm not upset necessarily but motivated enough to mention that I love onion rings. The Bobby flay onion ring I guess is a fancy way I've never had before because it tastes like biting into a RAW onion. I was looking forward to a rewarding meal after work and now I'm bummed. Since the waiter did ask how was everything I mentioned the onion rings. He smiled and said sorry. That's just how they make them. And moved on. Didn't offer fries instead or to take it off the bill. It's only a $4.75 waste of money for me. However since I've been in vegas 20 years and work with clients on the strip on a regular basis... guess where I'm not bringing business... that's correct. Bobby Flays.  Also the burger is OK. I can actually make a better one in my own at home.  On a side note, getting solicited by prostitutes outside, and a man dragging his drnk girl to throw up on the bathroom wasn't exactly a great way to start my weekend but that's Vegas in the strip!   UPDATE:  Well management reached out to me to apologize. It's nice when you recognize that there is good customer service still left in the world. Just the fact that they take the time to make sure that the customers are happy is enough for me to give the place another try. :)",

I thought I was at Burger King !  Lol. Ok. Read the idea behind it and thought ok I'm game, simple burger options kinda like a good food faster than a sit down restaurant but not \"fast food\".  Not cheap but location dictates a higher cost. So let that go not out of line at all.  But ummm. The service Was ALLLLL fast food   Definitely don't tip when ordering. Cuz your never going to see them again!   My kids turned into servers for us though refilling drinks ect.  The people that worked there just kinda watched.  The girl that took the orders was \"absent\"at best.  The bathrooms were honestly something out of a roadside gas station.  Men's had overflowing  toilet and the floor was wet all across it. Eek.",

My only complaint of the burger was that the bun got soggy.  Onion rings were very good.  They went great with the chipotle ketchup.  My wife and son had the basic cheeseburgers and fries.  Fries were nothing special.  The dipping sauce that came with them was not as good as the chipotle ketchup.    Service was not especially attentive.  I ran out of iced tea and had to refill my own drink with coke.  $61+ for three burgers, fries, rings, drinks, and a chocolate shake is pretty steep, but it is the Vegas Strip.",

Now if she had told me that when we entered I would have ordered one of those. How stupid!  So she made money for the business but not herself.

This place overall ranked as a nice fast food type of place. Similar to hook burger in LA. However that being said service was excels  and staff were friendly. The food was good but fries and onion rings didn't stand out from any other place I've had them. Ordered the grill cheese for myself which was perfect - crisp bread, gooey cheeses really well made. The wifey had a turkey burger but thought is was over cooked...would recommend if you're hankering for a quick bite but can't really say this one hit it out of the park.",

Me personally, I like good food and don't give a shit who's cooking it.  The place is clean, the menu is short, and the product is simple in a fantastic way.  It's like people don't understand that this is supposed to feel like a blue plate special/simple lunch counter/diner style.   The burgers come with a variety of toppings, all of them fantastic (that blue cheese, holy shit) but are presented simply because they want the beef to shine through.  You can tell the quality of the beef in every perfectly-medium bite.  The bun is nothing special, but that's ok because it's essentially treated as a vessel to deliver that amazing beef to your mouth.  It's not gimmicky and it's not flashy but damn is it good.  Take the lines at BRGR, I'll stay here.",

Everything is a la carte. I got the brunch burger, sweet potato fries, the wife got the philly, two soft drinks. It was a little over 30 bucks, a bit on the spendy side but this is the Vegas Strip.   Both burgers were cooked to our liking. The flavors of both burgers was really flavorful. The philly had the philly steak taste, the brunch burger was my first burger with an egg on it, yum! The sweet potato fries was really crispy on the outside and sweet yumminess on the inside. There was 4 choices of sauces, don't remember what they were but didn't really care for it.   The staff was really nice, the restaurant was clean and spacious. Definitely worth a visit when on the strip!",

Very greasy patties, not fresh vegetables in your burger, very small amounts of cheese, bacon or whatever extra is supposed to come with the burger.  Even in their cleanliness, the place has not been kept tidy.  It is also a shame that they deployed their app and reader to pay and for the 3rd time it is NOT functioning.  Tech could give you a great customer experience or major dissatisfaction which is the case.  After being the place to go for burgers, and being a regular I have to say I will not be coming back.",

I have worked hospitality, and would not let something like this go by the wayside. We won't be back, there are other places with better quality and service. And the apathy of management leaves a  lot to be desired....  Here is my email to the company:  \"Hey Guys: I ate at the Las Vegas Location on May 25th, 2016......a major insult to the Palate. The table talker stated that each cook is trained to make a   burger EXACTLY the way Bobby Flay would make it. I have seen Food Network, and heard that he is the king of Burgers. We'll, when I bit into my burger (my wife also agreed) it was comparable to a  drink of the Atlantic Ocean. I told the waiter about it, and his response was \"Yeah, sometimes our guy gets a  little heavy with the  salt\" Shame on Bobby, and Shame on the food industry for supporting this assault (or a salt) on the senses. -Dave\"",

Perfectly cooked, quality ingredients, great toppings, nice selection of sauces at the table, and most importantly, fairly priced. This place is nice, but much less pretentious than most of these burger snob joints that are popping up by the dozen it seems. As much as I love burgers of all kinds, the one thing that some of these places are forgetting is that it's still a hamburger. $10 will get you a great burger at this place that's every bit as good as the $16 burger you'll get at any other burger place with a celebrity chef's name attached to it.  Aside from the burger, the restaurant was obviously very clean (less than a week old, it should be). It's got kind of a neo-seventies feel to it. I like the squiggly shaped bar seating. The entire staff was pleasant, polite, friendly, and helpful. Everything seemed to run smoothly while we were there. You'd never know this place was brand spankin' new. The music was nothing offensive, and played at a decent volume.   The pistachio milk shake was damn good too. They even give you a huge ass straw to make it nice and easy to drink.   If I had to criticize something, the fries (both sweet and regular potato) weren't outstanding. There are several different types of fries that I'd prefer to dip in their delicious chipotle ketchup.",

Burgers  are pretty big and you can \"crunchify\" them, which means adding potato chips. I forgot to ask for my Brunch Burger (Sunnyside-up-egg, bacon, and American cheese) to be crunchified, but my friends had to smash their burgers to fit it in their mouths because the chips made it so tall. I probably would get it crunchified and just eat the chips instead of paying $4 for fries.  Both the regular and potato fries were super delicious! One of my friends got the regular & onion ring combo and it was plenty. Some yelpers are complaining that there are only 2 onion rings, but they're literally the size of my fist, so I wouldn't want more that 2!   You can get a shake for $6 or spiked shake for $9. Only thing is that they're pretty small from what I saw, so I didn't get one.   They also have like 6 different sauces, but NO RANCH! When we asked, they said a lot of people ask for it, so I don't know why they don't just add it in. Of their choices, I like the chipotle ketchup the best.   Overall, I would definitely come back and probably split a burger and fries with a friend because I almost exploded after attacking one on my own.   Happy Vegas-ing! :]",

(this is not a good thing...lol)  The onion rings are HUGE and amazingly tasty.  They look the size of a chunky, bangle bracelet.

This time we opted for a bobby Blue...a Crunchburger and a Classic. All cooked perfectly. The four of us shared an onion rings and a French fry. not all of us fans of the dipping sauce..but I find it very tasty. save room for their milk shakes...best ever..especially with the real whipped cream topping. I'm especially fond of the vanilla bean. It might be a little expensive than we'd like..but I find the overall experience is worth it. Bobby has a winner with this \"gourmet\" concept.",

When I saw Bobby's Burger Palace on the strip, I BEGGED my man to take me there for lunch (at 10:30 am). Being the darling that he is, he obliged and we each had a Bobby's Bleu with Cheddar instead of bleu cheese, shared a side of half fries and half onion rings - or as we joked, onion donuts, they were HUGE. And they were served with the best aiole. I garnished my burger with the chipotle ketchup. It was AMAZING. Great service too.  We topped it off with two beers and for roughly $35 were satisfied and happy!",

    "text": "First off, I am a HUGE Bobby Flay fan. Maybe my expectations were too high. A Palace, it is not. One half of the restaurant was a walk-up order counter in front of a dining room sort of sorts. The other side is trying to feel like a sports bar, but misses the mark there. All of it presents a cafeteria style, completely out of synch with the high-end shops and restaurants in the area. The Brunch Burger was underwhelming. I was waiting for those big bold Bobby Flay flavours to explode and instead, it was quite bland. The patty had no sear of any kind and was not seasoned well. Like a Grandmother's meatloaf sort of a thing. The egg was raw. Like, I completely understand egg yolk as \"sauce\" but the white should be firm and the yolk should be warm and runny not cold and watery. Oddly, the bun was a highlight - light and airy, not dense, just right. The cheese fries... NOPE. I envisioned real, melted cheese, not liquid fake-ish cheese that you would expect out of a machine at 7-11 for nachos 20 years ago. I mean, maybe the cheese sauce there was house made with the finest ingredients, but.. I doubt it. Tasted like melted Velveeta. Fries had no seasoning and were limp. The lack of crisp was made worse by the \"cheese\" sauce - soggy. Honestly, the highlight was the fact that we were eating at Bobby's place and we had a friendly bar-tender to take our order. Otherwise, a let-down. I would put any of my own home-made burgers up against what I was served here with confidence. I may not be able to \"Beat Bobby Flay\", but I bet you dollars to doughnuts I can beat his minions that run this joint.",

It did not disappoint - I had the Texas, which comes with seasoned patty, pepper jack cheese, coleslaw and pickled (which somehow I missed on the menu as I hate pickles and should have had them removed!)  The bun was a fresh sesame seed coated one (if only Five Guys could have a bun half as fresh as this one).  It was very tasty, spicy and crunchy, cooked to a perfect medium rare - which is hard to find at many restaurants.  We shared a coffee milkshake which was also very good, not too sweet and a good coffee flavor.  The onion rings are also very good, they come with a dipping sauce which I think had chipotle in it.  There are 4 sauces to try on every table - jalapeno, mustard, chipotle ketchup and burger sauce - all are good to try with the onion rings.  The prices are reasonable for something handmade & cooked to order.",

Had the Miami burger - its a Cuban Sandwich (ham, swiss cheese, dill pickle, mustard and mayo) on top of a burger.  I was brave and got my burger rare (I figure its Bobby Flay's place - he's got a reputation to uphold!).  Damn, it was good, very rich and just the right size. Burger was super juicy and tasty. My friend got a basic cheeseburger (medium-rare) and said it was absolutely delicious.    Clearly they have been listening to the Yelpers, because I was worried that the fries would have too much salt (i'm careful about how much salt I eat) - the fries were gorgeous; crispy and  lightly salted. My friend ate most of the them - he loved them!  It was okay though, as the burger was so filling that I couldn't have fit in anything else. Service was prompt and very friendly - the lady behind the counter was genuinely cheerful and very helpful explaining various items on the menu.  She clearly was well-versed on their menu, which is always great. Was a little pricey, but I'd definitely go back - I dare say it would be worth fighting the tourist crowds for this burger and fries..",

Every Throwdown or showdown he competes in I always want him to win, I mean he's Bobby Flay!! He made Foodnetwork famous, he is great on every show, Brunch with Bobby always makes me hungry.  As for Burger Palace, it is good. It's convenient, and very casual.  Not the fancy prestige of Burgr (which I love) So if you are in the mood for fast no fuss food, it will deliver.  But this is Vegas, so you expect a little glitz and glam, not here. The most glam they offer is a multitude of sauces on the table.  I enjoyed the sweet potato fries and their honey mustard sauce, I also had a feta salad which was interesting and generous on the avocado, all positive aspects. But onto the burgers, the best way to describe them is as a good burger from your friend's backyard BBQ. You know the charred, slightly dry taste, on an underwhelming bun, but you eat it and enjoy it because you are in good company, that's how they taste.  We also got a black and white milkshake, again it was good, about as good store brand vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup will taste. Bottom line, nothing fancy or memorable especially for its location, but you will enjoy it anyway because you are in the company of Bobby Flay!",

It's an upscale burger place with a modern twist.. burger I had was definitely on point and I thought surprisingly cheap for Vegas...  I would probably not have bothered even reviewing this place if it were not for the jalapeno poppers..  My sweet baby Jesus they were miles ahead of any sort of side fried thing I have ever eaten. They were served in little shot glasses with some sort of spicy sauce... Every time I eat anything bit sized and fried I think of them.  Perhaps I was really drunk but damn it those things have become as illusive of a taste to experience as a unicorn/ great white buffalo... Next time I'm in Vegas it's the first place I'm going... Don't let me down bobby!",

You know it's bad when you're sitting there wishing you were eating a McDonald's Big Mac instead!  I've tried many other burgers in town - Gordon Ramsay BurGR, BLT Burger, Burger Bar, Holstein's, Commes Ca - and I liked them all better than the one I had at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Some of those burgers I might have thought were nothing special but were at the very least ok.  Even the burger I had at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill, which I thought had a weird taste to it, tasted better than the burger I got here, which was just \"meh.\"  Didn't like the bun, didn't like the meat, therefore didn't like the burger.  Also, the vanilla shake I got was just \"ok\" at best.  I like my shakes thick but theirs was on the runnier side.  Definitely can't compare to the delicious shakes at Gordon Ramsay BurGR!  Or even Jack in the Box for crying out loud! :p  I tried to eat as much of my food as possible though - $40 for a burger meal for two and it's not even a sit-down type of restaurant?  Yikes!!  Note, if you get the combo of sides and choose onion rings as one option, you get only two onion rings!  (They are big ones though.)  The place was already busy at noon on a Sunday of a holiday weekend when I went, and half an hour later just about every table was taken, at least outside.  If you do sit outside, they will bring condiments, napkins, and silverware to you.  Also beware of the flies/gnats out there.  Service: courteous and efficient but robotic.    Give this place a try if you must.  On to the next one for me.",

The Crunchburger sounded intriguing-american cheese and potato chips. I've put chips in my sandwiches before so why not my burger? The burger was super simple but surprisingly tasty. I think the quality of the beef really comes through. My burger needed a little something something so I added both ketchup and jalapeno hot sauce and it was perfect! My friend got an order of the sweet potato fries and they were fantastic. Probably some of the best I've had.   I thought the prices were a bit expensive for just the burger ($8.50), but I later found out that BBP is so much cheaper compared to other places (I'm looking at you BurGR).  I think I would definitely come back and try more burgers the next time I'm in Vegas.",

It's more like a 2.5 for me but I'll round it up because Lola our waitress+bartender was doing a great job attending to the 8 of us.   I had the Brunch burger which was a burger that consist of egg + bacon + chips(if you want it to) and of course the patty. Bobby's burger palace makes their burger more into a classic american burger. It kinda left something to be desired for. I would say that the patty was actually juicy but everything else in my burger was so so. The egg was dry, I thought it would be yolky... the bacon wasn't crispy enough. The chips taste like lays but never had it in a burger before(which was aite). Kinda nice to have that crunch that the bacon lacked. The bun was most disappointing.   We had the combination of fries + onion rings. I thought the onion ring wasn't bad. The fries could be better but it wasn't terrible.  I probably wouldn't come back but I still kinda prefer this place over shake shack. The price is around $10 per burger. With that said, I probably wouldn't return to either one.",

I go in and the place wasn't busy at all at lunch time.  I wonder if many do the strips restaurants are slow during the weekday?  I and made my decision am I'm ready to order but the cashier was like hold on while she finishes her text on the phone...okayyy?  When her fingers stopped I ordered the Dallas burger, fries and a drink and was given a number to place where I sit.  It's self service drink so I get a ginger ale.  The fries came out about a minute after I sat down.  I wish it came out with the burger as I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for that.     The burger was the star of this show.  Although I ordered mid well, the burger still came out juicy.  All the toppings and the sauce came together really well.  It remind me of a burger you would make in your back yard.  (Opposite of what I had at Gordon Ramsay BurGR).  Negatives?  It needed a pinch more salt and it was on the small side.    The fries on the other hand were terrible.  1/2 the fries were old and grease filled.  They were most likely reheated old fries.    So would I return?  Maybe if a friend wanted to try.  But if it were just me, there are many other burger places to try in Vegas.  Sorry Bobby, you lost this showdown.",

Not very customer friendly in that respect. That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",

My first impression of the place was that it was super clean and the staff was very inviting. The tables were set up in a c kind of bar way that promoted conversation and also made for a lot of setting.  There were pictures interspersed with different quotes on the wall which made for a nice touch.  The menu itself was simplistic, pick your type of burger and then what meat you wanted. They also had some salads and different kinds of fries and onion rings that you could order.  My mom and I chose to split the crunch burger and the indecisive side which was onion rings and fries. The burger was a burger patty with cheese topped with potato chips. Even splitting it it was more than enough. It was juicy and great flavor. The onion rings were huge and lightly battered. Obviously handmade not the kind that comes from a bag. While the fries were fresh cut and flavorful. One of my favorite things was the variety of sauces that were on each table that you could try. The burger sauce was good. It had a smokey flavor that wasn't overwhelming.  The food came out fast and hot which was also a huge plus. Even though it was a fast casual place, people still came by to make sure everything tasted alright and how you wanted. I was impressed. I had come in on the recommendation on friends and family and I have to admit they were right to recommend it.",

Sure, i shoved chips in my burger and sandwiches as a kid, but all this did was add another layer of texture (crunch). The bun and bacon was nothing to rave about. This was a one napkin kind of burger. Fries were also average as well. I def had higher expectations for a Bobby Restaurant.  They also were all out of bud light and didn't tell me until I went to check on it at the bar after 10 minutes of waiting... really?",

First day I went had great service (5 stars service), but second day I went back had horrible service. They didn't come up and checked on us when they checked up on other customers. And they forgot to chrubchified our burger, which is okay because we are human and we forgot things sometimes. But I asked the server about the chrunchufied, and she said that she will bring the chips. 20 minutes later, still didn't get the chips.  The restaurant wasn't busy at the time. It's kind of disappointed in terms of lack of details.  Burgers are really good, but the experience is different without decent service...",

She gave it a lot of hype, and we were all excited to go. We were all disappointed with the staff and restaurant. The staff acted as if they didn't want to be there. The restaurant seemed old and poorly lit. The food was just adequate and nothing to write home about. The bacon that came with the burger  was cooked way earlier and was served lukewarm , and it was chewy. My niece who has been to the one in NYC at least eight times says this specific chain does not reflect the one in NYC. My wife and I are headed back there in Sept but that is one place we will avoid.",

Bobby's is located on the strip between Aria and Monte Carlo and was walking distance of my hotel.  It was a Friday evening and placing my order and finding a seat was done with ease.  The friendly female staff at the counter entered my order - brunch burger ( beef, egg, applewood bacon, and cheese), mix of sweet potato fries & onion rings and pistachio shake. My order arrived promptly - the burger was cooked to my request of medium and was juicy and yummy tasting. The rings & fries were solid tasting and the pistachio shake was on the small size but tasted superb.  Move over Gordon Ramsey and Shake Shack, I preferred Bobby's Flays Burger Palace!",

Lots of toppings and the bun held it all together.  I started with the bun just to test it then after it held up I ditched it so I had more room for fries/rings.    Fries, perfect crisp all the way through.  Might be the best I've ever had.  Rings, the onion stayed in the batter except for the bite.  Clean bites overtime.  First time I've seen that.

Five stars because this place had very tasty burgers and drinks for very reasonable prices. I got my crunch burger with a chicken patty and got it \"fit\" meaning instead of a bun it was on some greens with balsamic. It was essentially a plain cheeseburger salad with potato chips and it was perfect. Will I ever put chips on a salad at home? No. But I would get this dish again next time I'm in Vegas because it's silly and fun and allowed me to feel a little better about my choices, which one needs in Vegas.  If I could I'd award an additional twenty stars for the bartender James, the highlight of our dining experience. He simply delivered excellent service and genuine conversation. In an otherwise unexciting venue, he kept dining fun and light. More people ought to enjoy the stellar service (and great people watching of the strip) at the bar. Big thanks to James and the rest of the team at Bob's!",

It was a delightful balance between, savory, sweet and spicy with the patty, caramelizer onions and hot peppers. I requested the burger to be well done, yet it was still juice with a nice char on the outside. The bartender was very knowledgeable on the menu and personable as well. It was so good I came back one more time with my mother. I got the brunch burger and she got the burger of the month.. the Canadian one. Both were very delicious, although I believe I prefer the Philly. I also could not resist getting the onion rings.. they were nothing short of amazing!",

The whipped cream stood out as fresh and dense but not too sweet and very rich. Both shakes were just sweet enough for adult palettes, but Id've asked for a stronger pistachio flavor. $5.75 each (kinda high, but a dessert would be the same I guess?).   2) Brunch Burger and Crunch Burger, both medium-rare, $8.95 and $6.95. Both had a buttery bun that needed a bit of salt. The egg on the Brunch Burg was fried perfectlyyyy and was luxuriously runny. Mmm! The Crunch Burg wasn't dry but rather super sexy and texturally captivating.   Patties were thicker than a quarter and cooked just as requested. Plus they were seasoned with salt. But Id've liked some spice or herb; I reached for the sauces too much.   (3) Large fries. Thin-cut and obviously tossed in a nice mix of seasoning. Maybe a little too short to dip.  Plus I like mine a little crispier. Finished these without a problem though!   I'll come back for sure. Great price ($16 a person!?) and strong food, with kind, almost-too-fast service.",

A couple of days ago I was driving to Wyoming with a friend and we stopped at Bobby's, and we decided to sit at the bar top because the bartender said it was full service and we figured \"why not?\".   Caleb was our bartender and he just made my experience at Bobby's so much better than what I could've asked for. He was cheerful and fun, and he recommended to me to try the \"secret\" burger which was his favorite (American cheese, chili's, coleslaw) and I decided to give it a go. It was SO good. Once he realized we had similar taste palettes, he brought out his favorite dipping sauce without me even having to ask and said I had to try with my fries and again, it was just amazing. (Honey mustard with horseradish).  I always had plans to come back, but now I will make sure to check out the bar top to see if Caleb is working. Thank you!",

The first time you won my heart was on Iron Chef America back in the day, but this time you've won my heart with your deep quotes on the wall and your juicy buns ;)  Price: About $10 per burger and $5 per order of fries. ADD an extra patty for $4.  Food:  First of all, I have to note that the patties are thick and juicy which also makes them filling. I ended up sharing the New Mexico adding an extra patty and an order of fries. It was the perfect amount. The New Mexico burger was good, but it did not have any heat to it.. which was disappointing as it was the only burger on the menu that promises heat. TIP: Don't forget to ask for crunch!   Drinks: full bar!  Service: Good. Fast and friendly! Fast food style. Honestly, this place has pretty dope burgers and a good selection of sauces but what makes this place :( is no spice or hot sauce at all!",

I'm not going to recommend any particular burger because I've had two halves now, and they were all great.   I'm particular to spicy however.   Hubby is into sweets.    We had fries.

After a long day driving to Vegas, I was delighted to find that Bobby's Burger Palace was near my hotel. It was happy hour, so my family and I sat in the bar overlooking the strip bustle. The bartender took our order and offered several drafts that were on sale for happy hour. For dinner, I tried their L.A. burger which was cooked perfectly. What I enjoyed most was their sweet potato fries dipped in their honey-mustard-horseradish sauce. It was sweet, creamy with a little kick from the horseradish. The service was excellent, and our server checked in frequently to assist us. During this same trip, I tried the Shake Shack zoo down the street. If you want better service and a more peaceful atmosphere, Bobby's Burger Palace is the superior choice.",

First off this is simply above a Carl Jr's sorry to say but it is, and you get served off of plastic plate, interior looks super hip and cool, but when your burger is brought out, it reminds me of going to a weekend BBQ gathering served by uncle Fred who has been drinking beers and cooking your burgers.   We ordered the NM Burger obviously residing in NM we thought heck lets give it a try, the condiments over killed the burger itself and the presentation was very juvenile and it made me feel like I said \"Uncle Fred\" made it....... the meat itself was pretty bland and quite small even for the low cost definitely not worth it. The price is good, but I would rather pay more to get a quality burger that is culinary inspired and using good quality condiments.   The staff was friendly and attentive but when asked what we thought, we replied okay, she said well you order a burger right, so that is what you got a \"Burger\" they all taste the same there is nothing to it. I would never want my staff to respond that way to a guest, but as I said this is a glorified Carl Jrs, sorry Bobby Flay I would definitely take my name off so that you dont ruin your reputation or get some better training for  your staff that represents YOU!!",

I also think the onion rings are really good, they are to come with ranch sipping sauce and a few times they forgot but will bring it right back if you ask. The fries are really nothing special, I was hoping for better since the seasoned fries at lunch at Bobby's Mesa Grill in Caesars are so good. These taste like every typical hot dog stand.  The shakes are good and thick as well. We feel like the prices are slightly overpriced for what you get, and the fast casual atmosphere. But its Vegas, EVERYTHING is expensive!

Ordered the crunch burger comprised of a sesame bun, a meaty beef patty, American cheese and potato chips (same consistency as lays potato chips). Also order a coffee shake. Burger was tasty but didn't realize it came sauceless and no veggies. Had to ask for mayo, lettuce and tomato because I got to have those on my burger at a minimum. I give the burger a 4 after all my fixings. Good ratio meat to bun. I liked how there were 3 different sauces at the table to try: jalapeno sauce, chipotle ketchup, and a steak sauce (I think?). I liked the steak sauce the best. Coffee shake was creamy, a good thick consistency, great coffee flavor with specks of coffee beans. I would definitely come back to try his other burgers and shakes.",

The ambiance is pretty chill with a nice casual feel for a seat-yourself, order-at-counter restaurant.  I like the long communal sitting areas which work great for large groups. They also have smaller tables for smaller parties.  The burger.... well, it was good but nothing spectacular.  I had the seasonal burger which had jalapeno dill and banana peppers. The wife ordered a bacon potato chip burger. We also ordered sweet potato fries and onion rings and a pineapple coconut rum and mocha kalua vodka milkshakes.  The burger looked pretty sad for an $11 burger. The buns were heavily buttered, but it came across as greasy. The meat was delicious, but we thought it was too salty. I'm completely bummed I didn't take a photo. My bad. The sauces on the table really helped spice it up, but we kept referring how salty it was. The shakes and sides were pretty good and the service was was great.... but the burgers just were alright, which is a bummer because we were hoping for something...epic I guess.",

The burgers come out stacked tall instead of wide, which lets you have the satisfaction of smooshing it all down into a juicy condensed meat puck.   You can order any of the burgers \"crunchy\" which means they add potato chips to the top (whoop dee doo). It's more gimmick than anything but hey, who doesn't like potato chips?  I wasn't a huge fan of any of their specialty dipping sauces.  The burger itself is cooked perfectly. You can tell them exactly what type of done-ness you'd like and they get it on the mark. The meat and fries are both perfectly salted too, not too salty nor too drab. Good job guys.  It's a shame this is one of the \"cheaper\" eats in the area but it's worth checking out if you're hankering for a burger.",

    "text": "I had the Crunchburger and fries. It was basically a cheeseburger with potato chips. No lettuce, onion, or tomato. In fact, you add the condiments yourself so I guess it's similar to Fuddruckers in that respect.   Let's start with the good. I thought despite the simplicity the burger tasted alright. The beef was on par with the patties at The Habit which is OK. It came with two slices of American cheese. I know some folks frown on that but I like American. It melts and engulfs the burger which I dig. The fries are good. They are like bigger cut versions of In n Out fries I suppose.   Now the bad. A tad overpriced. Almost $9 for the burger, $4 for fries, and $3.50 for lemonade. As a guy that has paid upwards of $13 for a burger at Umami and BURGR I'm not against paying a premium for a hamburger, but I do expect premium ingredients if I'm going to do so. How about some grilled onions or some fancy sauce that'll knock my socks off? I'm not asking for 100% Prime Minotaur beef or anything just something other than potato chips to make the food stand out.  If the food was priced lower like say, The Habit then I would have given a 4 star rating for sure. I realize that celebrity branding is a reason for the high price but that also means high expectations from the consumer.   Overall I'd be willing to give BBP another shot since they have lots of other burgers. Plus it's fun to sit there to eat and people watch. Go with a friend and watch dudes walk by with a girl and try to guess girlfriend or prostitute.",

    "text": "Decent burger option on the strip. In True Bobby Flay style, most burgers have a sauce or two and the table comes with four more to try. Cactus pear margs are also legit and comparably priced to other places nearby, and taste a little stronger.  Service is fairly good- though you walk up and order, they bring food out to you and frequently stop to check if anything else is needed as they pass in and out of kitchen, which was helpful. At one point, while here with a group, an employee provided table service for additional purchases rather than making us wait in line again for add-ons like extra drinks or sides.  Brunch burger and classic crunch burger are both decent, still really want to try the New Mexico but last time I was in the area, I had already eaten. Might not be one of my top Strip picks (simply because I don't think burgers when I'm there), but it'll hit the spot.",

I was skeptical because I was not really in the mood for burgers, but I gave in.   When you walk in, you order at the counter. We were greeted by a nice girl, I think her name was Lala? Anywho, I didn't see a burger that I really wanted on the menu (I usually order the bbq, onion rings, and cheddar cheese kind of burgers); but Lala was more than happy to try and accommodate me! She started with a basic cheeseburger and just asked me what I wanted to add. Ended up with cheddar and bbq sauce, which works for me.   You are given a number and pick from any of the open seating. They bring you your food when it's ready. A nice guy (I forget his name but he was tall and bald) came to our table and told us the food would be out soon and proceeded to bring us silverware napkins etc. when our food came, he brought us a thing of all of these different sauces and explained the Flavors and ingredients in all of them! I was pretty impressed by this place thus far.  Our burgers were sooooo juicy and delicious!! I can't even begin to describe it. My burger had a seasoned kind of crust on it that was so good.  Needless to say I would definitely come back! I wish they had this place in the Bay Area!",

Strawberry milkshake was yummy, but it was $7! Sorry Bobby, won't be coming back.",

Tess has never been to Vegas and has been wanting to see the Bellagio fountain because I got her name from Julia Robert's character in Ocean's Eleven. I have taken Gavin to a lot of places but Tess never was able to go.   This meal was special to me. Our 1st vacation together. The 3 of us.   Tess ordered the turkey crunch burger, I got Gavin a grilled cheese sandwich, and I ordered the Bobby Bleu. Of course I had to get a starter: The Undecided (fries and onion rings).   The order did not take long but I was surprised when I tried the fries and it was cold. The onion rings were great.. even Gavin enjoyed it. The burger patty was super juicy and flavorful, seasoned just right. I LOVE the fact that it was rare. It's also messy to eat so don't order this if you don't want your hands dirty.   The sauces did not enhance anything to me. The jalapeno one wasn't wasn't spicy so I finished my meal w/o any assistance from the \"special\" sauces. After a long day of driving, it seemed that consuming over 800 calories in a single sitting was the smart thing to do.",

I received a nearly well done burger w no egg. I then received a sunny side up egg w uncooked white that was cold and no mayo. The red onions also still had the onion skin on. Never received mayo and wasnt hungry by the time the final version of the burger arrived. The chipotle sauces are also so strong they overpower the flavors of the burger. The \"pistachio\" shake was also vanilla bean. There are many other better places in Vegas.",

I had to remove the chips and just eat them separately since you cannot possibly get your mouth around the burger at all 3) Onion rings $4.75 - this was not good; not sure why my husband even ordered it, but would not recommend. the batter was very dry; lacked flavor. 4) Pistachio milkshake $6.95 - quite delectable; thick and rich  5) Pineapple coconut rum spiked milkshake $9.95 - yes it's spiked w/ alcohol but very light; just like a pina colada smoothie; you can ask for whip cream on top if you want  Total = $45.66",

    "text": "First, some qualifying facts:  1. I don't care for burgers 2. I'm a cheapskate  This place greatly exceeded my expectations. I love Bobby's cooking shows, but I know from experience that a famous name doesn't equal quality food.   You place your order at the counter and then take a seat with a number. The seating is very comfortable and decor is cool and upbeat. I ordered the Carolina with onion rings and a cactus pear frozen margarita.   Once your order is ready, the servers bring it to you from the deli style cook counter.   My burger was absolutely incredible. The patty was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the cole slaw provided a great crutch, and the sauce was subtle but added a delicious flavor to it. I swore I tasted a horseradish note  but it wasn't listed so maybe I just imagined it.   The onion rings were perfectly seasoned as well and had just the right amount of breading. Sometimes it can taste like an onion sandwich, but this added flavor but yielded to the onion. I don't care much for ranch, but it was great.   During the meal I commented to my wife \"ok, so I like SOME hamburgers\" as this honestly the first good burger I've had in years.  This place was a fantastic given it's location. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, making this feel more like a full service place versus a fast casual.   Heartily and completely recommended if you appreciate good service, tasty and quality food, and fair pricing.",

They had cool options and cool names but the taste was not up to par with how you expect Bobby Burger King's food to be. His recipes need some help.   I got the Brunch burger which was pretty basic even with the egg. The fries were ok.. definitely heavy with the cheese and bacon. I'd get that again.   Sadly there are tons of other burgers options on the strip that I would go to before coming back here.   I'm still a Fan Bobby!",

Walked in at 11:25ish and was told food has to be taken to go since they were closing soon which is understandable. I quickly asked Mary Mhay the cashier time they closed and she said 11:30 followed by her manager coming out to tell us that they closed at 11:30. After i received my food i confronted them asking what time they closed and she once again said 11:30 and i pointed out the sign and yelp stating midnight and she decided and give me the excuse that it was weekend only but nowhere does it state that. The following night i called and asked to speak with a manger and asked what time they closed and was told midnight, I then asked what time they closed yesterday and was told midnight and then i told her that i was told 11:30 the night before and they once again gave me the excuse that it was misunderstand like how do you get a misunderstanding when I asked what time you close and then you look at the sign and continue to tell me 11:30 and use the weekend excuse like that is no misunderstanding as well as having a second person to come out and repeat that you close at 11:30. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from here.",

I got the seasonal mulberry burger and it came with a giant chunk of melted mozzarella. Delicious! The patty and the buns were equally good. However, it does get a bit greasy, and I noticed a puddle of oil under the bottom bun.   Didn't order the fries, but they looked good.   They have a lot of condiments for you to pick from if you want to add more flavors to your burger!",

This BBP is on the strip in Vegas. We pretty much ordered every freaking burger on the menu including the veggie burger. Also, the fries, onion rings, and 2 milk shakes. Overall, the burgers are very good. The beef  (and veggies)  were seasoned very well. The cheese is melty and the toppings matched well with the overall description. The onion rings were not as good as I remembered. The batter wasn't the way I wanted it to be. It was flimsy this time. The fries were also just okay.   Overall, I definitely would go back.   However, Gordon Ramsay Burger is still one star better in my opinion.",

Service was friendly and meals were delivered to our people-watching window seats in short order. Also worthy of note are the prices, far less than just about any other place on the strip, especially for what you get: a exceptionally tasty burger approved by Bobby Flay. Great meal!",

The waitress had a hard time finding us (or anyone for that matter). Our food came to the table and it was wrong, so we had to wait some more. The burgers were good, but not mind blowing ... as you would expect from a Bobby Flay burger. I do recommend it if you are walking around on the strip and I will visit again, I'm just not a fan.

I'm pleased to say that Bobby's Burger Palace offers adventurous burgers without trying to go so crazy that they muck up everything. I got some sort of special Louisiana burger with sweet potato fries and glass of mango-lemonade. It was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice on it to make it tasty. Plus, with a variety of ketchups to select for my fries it was a great meal. Plus, the service was quite good, creating a very pleasing experience that I'd love to share with others in the future.",

Cons: - Burger bun was falling apart by the end of my burger  - Bathroom needs a code, but is printed at the bottom of your receipt! - Cashier expected a tip right after we paid but we said we wanted to wait until after we were served before leaving one.  - My mom's salad bowl was too small for mixing.

Who woulda thought potato chips in a burger?! It worked out to my stomachs delight. Homemade 1000 island, with pepper jack cheese and lettuce - yum!   Couple of orders at the table got the bacon burger - all were inhaled no gripes there. Tasty and filling.    Breakfast burger was also a hit - cooked to order with a side of fries ... and onion rings. No complaints here.   Milk shakes made the kids happy. No photos, but I'm sure others have a posting of it.   Parking for this place is not the best, but park at the Crystals/Aria and make ur way towards the strip and there it is.  Parking is no longer free along the strip- max is $18 if I remember correctly.",

    "text": "Yes I watch Iron Chef. Yes I'm a Bobby Flay fan. That led me to Bobby's Burger Palace one day in Vegas when I wanted a burger.   Since I'm a fan of the show, I know that Chef Flay is primarily known for his grilling and his spicy sauce accompaniments on his foods.   At Bobby's Burger Palace they do the grilling for you (fortunately) but you do the saucing. I ordered Palace Classic cheeseburger without onions and cooked medium, which came out perfectly.   I'm a fan of putting my own condiments on my food since I don't like when things are over-sauced. I can't tell you how many times I say 'light' for whatever sauce or condiment and it comes out drenched, so the bottle carousels on the tables so that you can add your own are awesome for me.   The sesame seed bun used for the burger is a nice touch. I've heard Chef Flay talk about this on his shows and how the seeds add something extra to the burger. A minor detail that goes a long way, in my opinion as well.  Service was attentive at the register and the food came quickly once I had found a place to sit. Seating is what I would describe as communal, which based on some of the other reviews not everyone is a fan of. It didn't bother me since my friend and I were able to still sit near one another and have a conversation.   My burger had good flavor and my visit was great overall. This seems like one of the few places in Vegas where you can get a decently sized and decent-tasting meal for a not-outrageous price.",

We also got a side of the fries and added bacon cheese and scallions and they were some of the best fries I've ever had. Service was good minus the cashier who wasn't very friendly. They don't really let you customize burgers here which was kind of weird because all I wanted to do was add a special kind of sauce to my burger that was offered on another burger and they said no. It's just sauce why not? Lol. Other than that I would highly recommend this place for a great burger if you're looking for something other than the buffets.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to try this place and looking very forward to giving it a good review. Sadly, Bobby's palace turned out to be similar to the ice palace in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for me. It enticed me in with promises of endless delight and then crushed my dreams. At least no one turned to stone, though.  The best thing about this place for me has to be the location. We were hungry after walking the strip and it was easy to get in and out with direct strip access. It was all downhill from there.  We ordered a variety of menu items and found out they couldn't be customized. We asked for additional items on burgers and some to be removed from other burgers and were told they were limited and couldn't add or remove items. Bobby's Palace, Bobby's burger. I realize that a chef crafts a meal to achieve a certain result, but this is a casual burger joint. There isn't even wait staff.If I want a tomato on my burger is that really a huge deal? When I asked the reason for the controlled menu I was given a response that if the burgers were customized by patrons Bobby couldn't be responsible for how people review them on Yelp because it ceases to be his recipe. Well, here you go. Once I pay for the burger doesn't it then becomes mine? If I want a tomato than I feel like that should be acceptable. It's not foie gras or any type of fancy gastronomical creation.    My second critique would be the price. I get it, it's Vegas and it's the strip. I should expect to spend more than standard prices, but I fed my whole family at the Cheesecake Factory at Caesars Palace for the same price with tip.   My third downside here may be an upside for some people, but I am not really a fan of the communal seating. It feels like a cafeteria to me and not a restaurant. It's not private and not particularly kid friendly since your kid may be impacting the meal of patrons surrounding you at the tables. It is also hard to talk or have an intimate conversation.   The most personal disappointment for me here, though, was the salad. It was tiny for the price, the produce was less than fresh, and I did not enjoy the mix of flavors. I had the crunch salad and the bitterness of the radicchio, cucumber, and feta combine with the vinaigrette was overwhelming. The flavors built on each other to amplify that bitterness and the avocado, romaine, and chickpeas were not enough to balance the flavor.     The only thing I really enjoyed here were the onion rings which were fairly good.",

I am a huge fan of you and all your shows, I wish I could do a Beat Bobby Flay with you, I know you would beat me any day and that would be okay with me. Your green chili burger was amazing as was my daughters classic burger. The meat was cooked and seasoned to perfection and the fries and onion rings were just divine! My green chile burger was so amazingly delicious and beautiful with the red grilled onions on top. I hope to come back soon and visit your other restaurant and try your tamales and other spectacular dishes, it's on my bucket list;) Bobby, you're the best, you don't know how much it meant to me to visit your restaurant. There's a dish in Guadalajara called \"carne en su jugo\", I think it's something you might like to try!  Thank you!",

The breads were super flat, totally look like two toasts on burger.  Onion rings were the worst, the skins weren't even crispy. It was like they were soak in water for at least 5 mins before they were served.  The fries??? Just dry, very dry, even McD fries are better",

My first thought was 'come on Bobby, I expect better than this from you' but my first bite changed everything. The egg was perfect, and complemented the burger perfectly. I posted a picture of it for reference.  One of our group had the burger of the month, which name escapes me right now, but the feedback from that was top 5 burger I've ever had. My daughter substituted chicken for her burger, which you can do for any of their burgers, and loved hers as well. All together we ordered 6 sandwiches, 5 burgers and one chicken sandwich and all received great reviews.   We ordered a couple of orders of fries and a couple of milkshakes. All were very good but the reason for the 4 star rather than 5 is both the fries and milkshakes were overpriced for their value.   All in all, I would highly recommend this place. There are many places to eat in LV but I've been here twice in three trips. That's saying something as I like plenty of variety, especially in Vegas.",

But it totally turned around immediately when our order was taken by a very nice and helpful employee at the counter.   We ordered the Brunch, the Dallas, a pistachio shake (with whipped cream, as suggested by the nice counter person), and an \"undecided\" side with half fries and half onion rings which was served with two divine sauces. I ate every drop of the white ranch type sauce.   Everything we got was delicious. Perfectly cooked burgers, amazing fries. The onion rings had some kick to them. I would say it appeared to be coarse black pepper in the batter. I liked them, but my dining partner loved them.   We'll be back next time we're in Vegas for sure.   Edited to include a mention of the giant, glorious pickles. So. Good.",

You are carted through a line to place your order as if you are in a Burger King. Then to top it off .. told you can add a tip on if you'd like. A TIP FOR WHAT???   All parts of our order came out at seperate times.   Fries first for my husband and daughter..I expected HOT Crispy fries.. instead they were barely warm and definitely soggy.... then my salad which was missing the Feta cheese that should have been on it. Then my husband's very underdone burger which was ordered for medium well but could be classified as medium if he was lucky. IS THIS NOT A BURGER PLACE???  Last but not least we were able to witness an employee argument between cashier and person who clears table.  Could have done without that type of DRAMA.  BOBBY FLAY.. IF YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR NAME ON SOMETHING ...YOU YOURSELF SHOULD EXPECT BETTER. VERY UNDERWHELMED AT BEST. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER.",

Decor looks like a fast food joint.  Gourmet burgers or fast food?  * scratches head*  My overall impressions?!  Worst burger experience I have had in vegas!  Bobby Flay is known for potato chips layered in his burger.  Fine!  Adds a crunchy texture.  Crunchify works so add points for that idea!  How did BBP lose me?  All of my group's burgers were extremely salty!  Can I get some beef with my salt, please?!  Shocked at how salty our burgers, we watched as the cooks lathered up other orders with an avalanche of salt.  Oh boy!  I would assume cooks would know when too much is too much...  In addition, my patty was overcooked!  Ordered medium but received medium well...  You have one job, make burgers!  Can you customize your burger at BBP?  I didn't see pricing for that... =(  Ending this review on a positive note, the shake was delish!  Move along folks, nothing to see here!",

    "text": "Bobby Flay seems to be everywhere these days. Unaffected by his recent tabloid exposure, his empire of restaurants, TV shows, signature sauces and spices, cookbooks, and kitchenware are ubiquitous.  I even dreamt that Bobby came over to barbecue with us the other night (note to self: cut down on late-night Food Network binges). I am a fan of his big bold flavors and southwestern-style food.  We look forward to discovering a life-changing restaurant or meal each time we visit Las Vegas. This trip, we made reservations at Giada's. Our second choice: Bobby's Michelin-starred Mesa Grill @Caesars. The main reason we chose Giada's was convenience, as it's is a short walk from our City Center hotel. Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) was not even on our radar.  But as we walked out of our hotel in the middle of this hot, drought-stricken desert city carved by time, tradition, and the mob -- right there in front of us -- a mirage? NO. Psychosis? NO. Standing tall: a BBP!!! The skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked a bit like Cat Cora chanted...\"hallelujah\".  I got on my OpenTable app and dropped Giada faster than NBC dropped Bill Cosby's fall sitcom, choosing BBP instead (sorry Giada D!). Note to Giada: Since you and Bobby are such good \"friends\", you should be okay with this.  What I knew about BBP is that it was created to serve food that Bobby himself likes to eat when he's done working in his kitchens. Simple burgers, fries and shakes with his signature gourmet touches. Until recently -- the locations were all on the east coast. But now open for your west side Flay-fix, the largest Burger Palace ever -- at City Center in Las Vegas.  Designed more like a hip lounge or bar, the place has brightly colored lime and brown furnishings, sweeping curved counters and walls, ample window seating, long communal tables, whimsical light fixtures, and striking neon signage. Bold design to prepare you for some bold flavors ahead.  I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger. 6 full ounces of 80/20 Certified Angus Beef with perfectly melted blue cheese. Bacon, lettuce and tomato on a soft sesame seed bun. \"Crunchified\" of course - topped with crispy thin potato chips. Took a bite... OMG... the skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked like Cat Cora chanted...\"hallelujah\".  Combined with the transcendental golden-brown Vidalia onion rings that taste as good as they look, and the LIFE-CHANGING cream-a-licious \"mocha caramel\" shake, this was a meal that sang together in beautiful, perfect food harmony. The burgers, rings, and shakes I've been eating my entire life are now totally meaningless.   I would gladly eat at Bobby's Burger Palace regularly -- but as of now there are no California locations. So I guess its back to the Food Network and Cooking Channel we go....  Protip: If you can't get a regular Flay-fix because you aren't on the east coast (or Vegas), you can take any of the house-made sauces home for $6-$10. BBP Fry Sauce (tangy mayo, roasted red and adobo peppers), Burger Sauce (think steakhouse sauce, thick and rich), Chipotle Ketchup (smoky and fiery) or the Jalapeno Hot Sauce (green chilies for heat).   #FearTheCosby #GetCrunchified #FoodNetworkBinge #LifeChangingShakes",

I had asked to wash my hands in the bathroom before I placed my order, she says no that it's for customers only. I told her I am about to place my order I just need to wash my hands (it's Vegas and we all know the door handles are dirty), she says you have to buy something to get the bathroom code on your receipt and walks away. I should have just left at that point, but we decided to try it anyway since we came for the food and not alcohol. The woman who took the order was not even the slightest bit nicer, yet for some reason we stayed. I order an LA burger, medium well, fries and a tea. We sit down to a table to wait for our food and see the tables are all cleared of dishes, but still dirty despite the place being mostly empty. I took a photo of the napkin dispenser because the whole top was so dirty that wiping it off didn't remove the dust/dirt. I expect clean from all establishments let alone one with an iron chef's name on the front.  We waited a long time for our food especially considering the place had maybe 10 people in it, looked over to see our food sitting under the heat lamp while 5-6 employees just stood next to it chatting with the cooks. About 5 minutes passed before they brought our food over.  The burger was both boring and had the most salty patty! Some bites were so salty they were barely edible. There is a basket of sauces on the table so I had to add some aioli to make it more flavorful, but chose carefully to pick the least salty. The burger patty was barely cooked at all so the middle was barely warm (I ordered medium well). The fries were ok, the sauce that comes with them was ok too. After all that salt I needed more tea, I looked around and I couldn't find an employee. I looked again and finally saw them all in a huddle at the back of the restaurant chatting away again. I walked over to ask if there were free refills on the tea and the girl says \"oh, yeah, sorry\" and lazily walks to the front of the restaurant to get the pitcher. Seriously!!! We left feeling upset with ourselves for choosing this place. NEVER AGAIN!    Follow up on the burger: my stomach was upset all night, apparently the barely warm burger meat wasn't cooked to the proper temperature.",

I had an amazing Turkey burger and my best man had a really good Palace burger.    I also had fountain ginger ale for the first time as far as I know. (Wait so there's a pager emoji but not a fountain drink emoji? ) hmm.     Anyway not pricey because you get what you pay for and I've paid more for less and worse combined",

I got the chicken 'chip burger' which was simple with american cheese and a few potato chips on it. I wanted turkey but they were out, so i decided if i got the chicken burger i'd do something different with it and i thought it was really good and not something i would typically order. my boyfriend went with the blue cheese beef burger and loved it. he also got a cookies n' cream shake with a shot of rum and it was so good. so good I wasn't even sure if they put the shot in(?) still deciding if that's a good thing or a bad thing lol. all in all, this is a good place on the strip with a diner vibe, great burgers, quality ingredients & inexpensive prices. i'd say it's a win/win if you're looking for a quick bite while wandering.",

The meal was very filling, and I wound actually say the burger alone was enough to satisfy my hunger. My only complaint was that the veggie burger patty was a bit flimsy and broke apart during consumption. I would be happy to eat here again. Nice atmosphere.",

Knowing Bobby Flay is king of FLAVOR I came with high expectations of a juicy burger packed with flavor. I ordered the burger of the month which was the Smokehouse BBQ burger. I ordered it medium well and received it well done. They must have forgot to season my burger because I had to add plenty of salt and pepper to give it any kind of flavor. Everything was muddled and one note. I could barely taste the BBQ sauce and the onion strings were almost non-existent. The best part of my meal were the fries that I added  cheese and bacon to. Man was that cheese sauce to die for! Besides that, definitely not worth the $39 we paid for two people! To the cooks in the back, this a Bobby Flay restaurant and your food quality should be living up to the name! I will not be back here unless I am craving cheesy bacon fries. The burger looked delicious I just wished it tasted that way as well.",

The burgers were perfectly cooked (medium) and so perfectly seasoned. It made me so sad that there's not one closer to me in NYC.  If you're ever close to a Bobby Burger Palace, just go!

    "text": "Prime location (right in the front of the CityCenter campus), celebrity name recognition, quality ingredients for another gourmet burger spot right on the Strip without the extravagant pricing = Win, Win situation for Bobby Flay and his customers, especially those in the vicinity of Aria and the surrounding properties.  If you have a MLife Rewards Card, show that to the cashier when you place your order and you will save yourself 10% right on the spot.  Instant gratification for the win!  And don't get too excited and distracted and forget about the BBP Rewards card, where every dollar spent equals 1 point, and you can redeem 100 points for a burger, sandwich or salad.  Not too shabby!  Before I get into my review of the food, let me just say that the waitstaff here are amazing.  We are not in a fancy smancy gourmet restaurant, but that does not stop the waitstaff that roams the \"patio\" and the restaurant from delivering that much appreciated authentic friendly and upbeat attitude for all the customers.  Great job of selecting fantastic employees and providing top notch training.  Now the burger.  I was going to get the New Mexico Burger, given that the description was very enticing, plus the flavor profile seems right up Bobby's alley of culinary expertise.  But I was swayed last minute by the little Burger of the Month signage where you queue up to place your order.  So I ended up getting the Canadian Burger (White Cheddar Cheese, Canadian Bacon, Maple Mustard Sauce for $10).  The burger itself was cooked perfectly (I asked for Medium Rare, and it came out juicy and red in the middle).  Presentation was simple.  The burger itself was not large and definitely not pack with too many competing ingredients and flavors.  But I would have preferred it served with some lettuce and sliced tomatoes.  The sesame seed bun was okay, probably better than what you get at McDonald's, but it is not at the same level as a fresh oven baked brioche either.  But for $10 it really is a great deal for this neighborhood.  I also ordered the Vanilla Bean Malted Shake with real whipped cream, it was good, but the portion was underwhelming and will set you back $6.50.  Personally I would just order two different burgers and be done with it and find dessert next door (PinkBerry or Starbucks).  Other details:  you have 3 choices of proteins (Certified Angus Beef, Ground Turkey and Whole Chicken Breast), no vegetarian options, and at the tables you have condiment racks filled with your typical salt and pepper, ketchup, yellow mustard, and Bobby's gourmet sauces (Chipotle Ketchup, Burger Sauce, and Jalapeno Hot Sauce).  I tried all of the gourmet sauces and all were good, but I preferred the Burger Sauce the most.  So definitely a great, relatively inexpensive spot to stop for a bite to eat as you stroll up and down the Strip or wondering inside Crystals or Aria, especially with the great friendly service (that alone bumped it up to 4 stars in my review).

    "text": "Who would have thunk that Bobby's Burger Palace smack dab in the City Center on the Vegas Strip and not attached or associated with a casino would be one of the most affordable places to eat at!  Hat's off to Mr Flay!  Mind you the prices were on average $2.21 more than what the email menu I received from Bobby's news letter was but at $9 per burger that is still cheap in Vegas terms :)  The location is mid sized but makes good use of space with cool cafeteria style bench seating.  There is probably room for around 100 people or so.  The ordering system is cafeteria style as well, ordering at the register and then having your food brought out to you.  The menu is fairly basic other than the 5 or six gourmet burgers offered.  I think there was a grilled cheese on the menu, sweet potato fries, regular fries, onion rings, milk shakes and frozen alcoholic drinks as well.  We sampled the following:  La Burger: about a 1/3 pound super juicy burger served with your choice of cheese and a avocado relish.  The burger was tasty and filling $9.00.  Crunch Burger: a cheese burger served with potato chips inside. My daughter loved this burger saying it was one of the best she has ever had.  You can \"crunchify\" any burger for a small charge.  $8.50  Dallas Burger: a cheese burger served with coleslaw and bbq sauce.  Juicy tender and cooked to perfection this was a good burger $9.00  Onion Rings: super wide cut onion rings in a light batter.  The rings were very juicy when you bit into them but didn't come with any special dipping sauce and could have used more seasoning in the batter $4.00  Sweet Potato Fries: a large portion of tasty fries served with a honey mustard dipping sauce, could have been crispier but they were good $4.00  Dark Chocolate Milk Shake: a thick tasty shake, but not worth $6.50  Overall we really enjoyed this place.  The burgers are not the best on the strip but they are certainly the most affordable gourmet burger on the strip.  Stay away from the over priced shakes and you will leave here with a full belly and some spare cash in your wallet :)",

Get in line or is that for to-go orders? WHAT DO I DO???!! We figured it out but many weren't so successful lol. We ordered the brunch burger crunchified (since Holsteins version was so good), the classic healthy style, sweet potato fries,  regular fries, cactus pear margarita,  and a red wine.  Brunch burger was suppose to be medium but no pink in sight. The chips were just... chips... kind of like Lays orginal. Unlike Holsteins which seemed kettle cooked. Salad was good not great,  lettuce was wilted so it became hard to pick up with the fork.  And no I didn't drench it with dressing. Margarita was delish and the wine was just wine --that you can just skip. Get two margaritas instead.  This place can be passed on our next visit.",

It was well done as I had ordered and very juicy with great flavor. The chips on top are just genius and provides the extra little snap to make this burger great!   This is a great burger joint! We paid about $20 for two burgers and a drink. I think that's a bargain for the quality that you receive.",

When we ordered at the counter two servers went back and forth in front of us about why there were no strawberry milkshakes, which is what we ordered... So we told them we didn't want the milk shake and after he rang us up we asked for an itemized receipt because the bill was high. As he handed us the receipt he admitted to charging us for the milkshake still! If we hadn't asked we wouldn't have gotten charged for it! The burgers were decent but both mine and my husbands were under cooked. I had to send mine back and didn't get a new one until my husband was almost done with his. Also we ordered the half and half of French fries and onion rings... We only got 2 onion rings... I won't be going back.",

The only negative thing I did not like was employee's eating at the same tables and then immediately stayed serving food with out washing there hands.

I was really disappointed that my bun looked and tasted like it had been purchased from the supermarket. I expected more. My husband had the Carolina burger which he enjoyed but also said that it was nothing special. For sides we had onion rings and sweet potato fries which were, again, good but nothing I'd have to have again. The only thing that I truly truly enjoyed was the coconut milkshake --- absolutely heavenly (if you like coconut) and I would definitely wait in line for that bad boy!! It was a lovely LV day so there were people sitting outside and the vibe was super casual and laid back. It is a nice little place to stop in for a quick bite when you don't want to put up with the madness inside all the casino/hotels. Would I come back? I might -- only because of that coconut milkshake and the minimal wait time to eat.",

First off, when I walked in, the counters and floors were a mess. There was a knife laying in the middle of the aisle. Once I found a clean table I had to wipe off the seat. They were empty and all of the staff was having a good ole time chatting.   I ordered the Dallas with half fries and half onion rings. The burger was under cooked and tastelessly greasy. The fries were small and soggy. The onion rings were falling apart and greasy. The only positive thing I can say is the chocolate shake was good. Avoid avoid avoid!",

The fries/rings were solid, with the rings being the better of the 2. The burgers though were excellent. My wife ordered the palace classic and raved about it. I had the Bobby Blue and came away impressed. Great crust on the burger, and it stayed juicy inside. They even gave us 2 lemonade's to go even though we had only ordered 1 to split during our meal. Great food and great service. And anyone complaining about the price is crazy. 2 burgers, fries/rings and a lemonade for under $30 on the strip is a steal.",

These burgers could of been amazing but they were just way to salty. It was hard to finish the burger. I looked into the kitchen and could see the cook pour 4 heaping handfuls of salt on the hamburgers I immediately figured out why they were so salty. The fries and all the sauces were really yummy, and so was the margarita. They were strong and came in a really cute cup you can keep. If the burgers weren't so salty I would of gave this place 5 stars.",

I ordered a turkey burger with the fried egg on top. I shared an order of sweet potato fries with my cousin. Our food was very good. My burger was juicy and I loved the sesame bun. I was disappointed that that staff had not cleaned some of the tables because they were not that busy. We sat at table near the window so we could see the street.   Someone had started cleaning the table but had left a dirty table cloth on the table and the napkin holders in several chairs along with the condiment containers. This took up several chairs along the window. We were in the restaurant over an hour.Other employees saw this but never addressed it. This made the restaurant look dirty. I will try some of the other burger restaurants during my next visit.",

    "text": "Whenever I'm craving a burger, I stop by Bobby's Burger Palace during my lunch break. The service is always fast, friendly and the food is quite tasty. It's located right in front of Aria and Waldorf Astoria off the strip. Your best bet is to park at Aria, get a quick bite to eat and then leave since you can get free parking if you leave under an hour. The seating here is set up with communal tables but the tables kind of curve a bit so it doesn't feel like you're so close to the strangers around you.   My go to burger is always the L.A. Burger. I love the avocado relish that comes on the burger and I ALWAYS get my burgers \"Crunchified\" which means they add potato chips in your burger. The only other burger I have tried was the Philly Burger, which is basically their version of a philly cheesesteak, and is also great. I also like to compliment my burgers with sweet potato fries. It comes with this amazing honey mustard-horseradish sauce, which is sweet with a nice little kick to it. If you can't make up your mind, they also have \"The Undecided\", which I usually get mixed with the sweet potato fries and onion rings.   I have also tried their Pistachio milkshake which is really delicious. I've never had the opportunity but you can spike it with a shot of vodka, rum or bourbon for an extra $5. If you can't decide between the burgers or milkshake flavors on the menu, you can always ask what the \"Flavors of the Month\" are to try something new.  Also, make sure you get your loyalty BBP card so you can start racking up points towards free food!",

The pickle on the side was on point and crisp and delicious.    My husband and I split the undecided, which allows you to pick two sides.  We mixed fries and onion rings.

That's reverse-psychology or something, right? It must have worked because she wasn't interested in his burgers (but she still loves watching Bobby Flay on The Food Network). For me, I had a decent lunch.   I got the Bobby Blue + Bacon Burger and shared The Undecided (half order of onion rings and hadlf order of sweet potato fries). My burger was cooked perfectly. I admit that it was under-seasoned but the blue cheese, bacon, the chips (I got it Crunchified), lettuce, and tomato worked well together. If you love blue cheese, this burger is for you. The onion rings and sweet potato fries weren't anything special but it allowed me to try the carousel of sauces.  Overall, it was a nice lunch before checking in to our hotel room. It sits right on The Strip so you can't miss this prime location.",

Tried the burger of the month, the Chicago style Greektown Burger, i opted for chicken rather than beef. It had a delicious tatziki with cucumber tomato relish with feta cheese and fresh dill. It was dreamy. A perfect combination of flavors.  We got the combo fries and onion rings because they are both so good, how can you choose? Crispy bites of heaven served with a house ranch and fry sauce (both so good). Ive always been a big fan of Bobbys Chipotle Ketchup, its sweet and got just the right heat.  You cant leave without having his famous cactus pear margarita.  So freaking good!!!! Service was fantastic, food was just as good as I remember. Crave-able.",

    "text": "The ambiance is beautiful when you walk in. Unique tables and chairs are placed in a very eye appealing way. Each condiment holder specifically placed on each table. Everything looked magnificent.  The first impression of customer service did not match the rest of the feel.  There was a group before my family. They were somewhat confused with something regarding the menu. There was no employee there to acknowledge, help, or provide any type of customer service. They were left there to fend for themselves. As they approached the cash register to order there still were no employees there. Approximately five minutes later an employee finally walks up and that was the first time anybody from that group was acknowledged.  After my family ordered we sat down and I noticed some things that I didn't prior.  There were dust pans just laying around. Even a sanitizer bucket with solution on the floor.  Though the staff on the floor were friendly, these items should not be in customer's view.   We ordered our food to go. My wife and my son both had the same burger but specific things done differently to them. The containers they were in did not specify in any way which was which. Since we were family it wasn't a big deal to dig through the burger to figure it out; however, if I would have went with some friends, we would have to dissect each burger, if we ordered the same but different, in order to figure it out.  We also ordered shakes. My daughters shake had a piece of paper in it. Though the shake was absolutely delicious, finding a piece of paper in it actually made my 7 year old daughter not want it. The place looked great but the lack in customer service and attention to detail with their products to make a full great experience did lack in numerous areas. I expect certain discrepancies at Burger King or McDonalds but not at Bobby's Burger Palace.",

Upon arriving you'll see the restaurant is unique with curved \"U\" stylish tables, the decor is modern-hip with greens, yellows and oranges.  Here you stand in line and then order.    During the order process, Bobby's is straight forward and the burgers are $10-12 and fries $4.75.   This is different then their website which shows everything $1-2 cheeper; no biggie this is Bobby Flay right?  It's gonna be worth it we say.   The service was not awful but just so so.  While in line to order, the attendant was txting on her phone. I ask if she could take our order, she replied \"your going to have to hold on!\"  The next person heard that and quickly waved us over.   The quality of our order was where we had the greatest hope and had the biggest disappointment.  The burgers were well seasoned, but the bacon on each sandwich was burned dark mahogany (to the point the bacon would crumble into black pieces), the fries were soggy and everyone thought @smashburger or @meatheads has much superior products.    If your like me, see Bobby Flays name and wanna try; I suggest you spend your hard earned burger bucks elsewhere in town.  Of course this is just my two cents.",

But it was far from it. The place is very fast food looking. I got a burger and it was decent but didn't come out hot ( and it came out 5 minutes after we ordered) and my bottom bun was completely soggy, I had to ask the bartender for a new bun. The presentation of the food looked like a McDonald's and the plates looked cheap. The only good thing about the place were the onion rings and the bartender James! He was very nice and made the experience better than the food.   My burger was $10 and fries and onion rings like $5. For the extra couple dollars I much rather would've gone to gordan ramsy burger. I've eaten there 10+ times and it's always on point. And I forsure don't have to worry about it being cold or having soggy food!",

    "text": "I went to this location to make a direct comparison to Gordon Ramsay's burger. Although, I enjoyed my experience at this location more than Ramsay's, I can't make a direct comparison because Flays burgers have more freshness and tastes lighter. Ramsay's burgers are very rich and wholesome.   Flays burgers remind me of San Diego because they have an LA burger with avocado. It is so good. They cook the burger well and the tomatoes are really fresh. However, the cheese isn't fully melted in the burger. The cold tomato hardens the cheese. That's a downside to the burger. But the bun is made like grandma's style because you can see the bread has been pulled apart. It gives it a great feel. Overall, it was a great burger.   The sweet horse radish sauce is so good. It goes great with sweet potato fries but I would put it on anything! It's that good.   The fries are delicious but the English style cheddar sauce tasted awkward for me. It didn't have the smoothness of a great cheddar sauce and it didn't go amazingly well with the fries. I would stay away from the loaded fries.   Overall, I would come to this location for a great burger. I'm not sure if this is a replacement of Ramsay's place, but it's definitely a place you have to visit if you are a burger connoseir.",

Others in my party ordered the crunchburger, a cheeseburger with potato chips. Everyone loved their food! My burger was so good but there were a few very spicy chilis in it. The fries were amazing!

    "text": "After watching hours of Beat Bobby Flay & having heard of Bobby's Burger Palace on the show multiple times, we decided to check it out during our trip to Vegas. Located centrally on the Strip, this burger spot offers several unique options. As someone who doesn't eat beef, I was excited to see that ALL of their burger options are offered with a choice of chicken or turkey along with beef as well. For vegetarians, they also have a veggie burger, grilled cheese, & chopped salad.  After reviewing their menu, I went with something that I thought would go well with the chicken option - the Dallas burger. It came with spice-crusted chicken, coleslaw, Monterey Jack cheese, pickles, and BBQ sauce. My husband went with their December burger of the month - Bobby's Christmas Burger. This one came with beef, Monterey Jack cheese, red chile sauce, and green chile salsa. We also got a side of fries & onion rings.  The Dallas burger was messy but delicious! I think the smokey but ever so slightly sweet BBQ sauce was so good; the chicken was grilled well and had melty cheese on top. My husband said that his burger was cooked perfectly medium rare. It had spice with the sauce & salsa. Again messy but super tasty! I'd recommend the fries over the onion rings .. they were crispy & I literally couldn't stop eating one after the next.  Overall, this is a great casual spot for lunch or dinner. The seating was a little different, community-style rather than individual tables. It was clean & the service was prompt. We'll be back to try out some of their other options!",

We would eventually break up, Bobby falling in disarray because he lost the love of his life, and I would have custody of Nacho.   *insert thinking emoji* This has absolute no relevance to my review but I guess those dreams somehow led me to eat a burger at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Wewt!  I must say, I was kind of underwhelmed.  For someone who so passionately loves burgers, how can the beef be so under-seasoned?  The cook on the meat was a perfect juicy medium-rare but most of the flavor from my burger, the flavor of the month: Napa Valley Burger [goat cheese, Meyer-lemon honey mustard, and watercress], came from the Meyer-lemon mustard.  It was too sweet for my liking.  I got mine Crunchified because I figured I needed some texture.  I did enjoy a bite of the Bobby Blue + Bacon Burger [blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato].  If you love blue cheese, you will love this burger.  To be shared was The Undecided [half order of onion ring and half order of sweet potato fries in our case].  I was excited to be able to try all his sauces as well.  The jalapeno hot sauce was fire!  Bobby's Burger Palace is a brightly lit, colorful, burger joint on a great part of The Strip.  I wouldn't mind stopping in again but real-talk, there are many better burger place on The Strip for around the same price point.",

The menu is right next to the registers, and if you're eating here, they give you a number and will bring the food out to you!  I got the New Mexico, with a regular beef patty and crunchified, which means they just put potato chips in your burger, an order of the half fries/ half sweet potato fries, and a Cactus Pear Margarita!  The burger itself was juicy and pretty hefty! The jalapenos in the burger is what made it for me. I'm usually not a huge fan of jalapenos in stuff, but these were delicious! It brought all the flavors of the burger together.  The fries were alright, nothing really stood out about them. What was good though was that horseradish mustard dipping sauce! I kept eating fries because of that sauce! If you don't get fries, just ask for the sauce, pretty sure it'll be delicious on a burger too!  The margarita was also pretty good, had good flavor - can't really describe it, just kind of fruity. The cup is small, definitely wish there was more of it!  Overall, quick and easy place to grab food at if you're in Vegas! You are dining on The Strip, so it does get pricey, but worth a try in my opinion!",

    "text": "After needing a late night dinner in Vegas we decided to get a sandwich at Bobby's Burger Palace. I'm one of those I hate frozen patties kind of guys. Im not a fan of In and Out Burgers, sorry but I like a good meat to bun ratio with a good quality meat. Bobby's hit the nail on the head with his burgers. Buns were fresh, burgers were a good quality probably 80/20 fresh pressed burger that was seasoned well. I got the bacon crunch which is thick cut bacon with a handful of potato chips on it. Potato chips on a sandwich isn't a new thing for me and I love the texture and light taste that they add. I got my burger done medium well and my wife got hers well done, both were very juicy and not dried out. I got an order of fresh cut fries which were very good, condiments on the table were very tasty and complimented the fries. My wife and I both agreed that Bobby's Burger Palace was one of the best burgers we've had in a very long time. I will definitely stop back for another meal when I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "Burgers are my go to food and I was excited about trying this place. I can't say I was impressed or disappointed but more in between. Here is the breakdown.   The burger I had was the classic palace burger (normal cheese burger) decided to try the original first. The burger meat and cheese was very good. Juicy and taste good. The chips on the burger were just a crunch factor didn't notice anything special. The biggest factor for me was there was too much red onion and not enough sauce of any type. Which leads to the other part of my review. The chipotle ketchup (keep in mind I'm not a chipotle fan at all) was probably the better of the sauces. The burger sauce was horrible it had a strong taste of molasses to me. I couldn't eat it. The sauce that came with the fries was good. So I used that sauce with the burger. It was also better than the others even though it had chipotle flavor as well. I ended up using a combination of the fry sauce and normal ketchup to add to the burger.   All in all I would try another burger as maybe it was just the one. But not super impressed for burgers.",

I did go just because of Bobby Flay's name. I was disappointed when we ordered that they were out of green chiles to make green chile burgers. However, I ordered just a classic burger like one you would make in your backyard. It was very, very good. Great bread and fresh toppings. The meat was so flavorful. The meat stood out from all the other burger components. Excellent. Very good onion rings too! I wish I could have stilen the sauces on the table and taken them home. I tried every one except the plain mustard and ketchup. All were so good that I asked if they sold the sauces (they don't). I was pleasantly surprised by this place.",

But the bun... my goodness. Dry AF. Doesn't go well with the meat patty at all.  Mcdonald's has better and fries, and it's cheaper. The only thing this place is better is the decoration.

Hardly any of the employees ever smile at you, give any eye contact or even look happy.

The burger is definitely a step up from fast food, but a step down from gourmet. I would put them right in the middle. Sometimes the bottom bun of my burger is served to me a little soggy, but overall it's a great burger at a decent price.",

Arrived at my table, and it looked delicious! Bit into it, and initially it didn't have much flavor, kept chewing and my face contorted into the ugliest expression I could possibly have formed. There was such a horrid chemical aftertaste. It wasn't just the patty either. The tomatoes and lettuce tasted off as well. Even the sauces at the table had that chemical taste!!! Perhaps the whole damn restaurant tasted like a chemistry lab. Bet money if I'd licked the floor, it would have that same unappealing flavor.  Seeing as how the veggie burger was the only thing on the menu suitable for my dietary needs, I know I for sure won't be back. Well, maybe if you paid me $50 I could change my mind. Perhaps it was just an off day, idk.   The fries were decent. Had to generously salt them, but they were crispy.",

    "text": "As a recent Vegas resident and lover of all things Bobby Flay, I was super stoked to find Bobby's Burger Palace on the strip to try out. In fact, I only discovered this after I watched a \"Beat Bobby Flay\" episode where it mentioned his restaurants in the credits. I looked it up...and sure enough!  First off, hardly a line for ordering and plenty of room to settle in at 8pm on a Friday night. The menu is large and viewable from the strip as you're walking by. I decided on the Veggie Burger and onion rings while my husband ordered \"the Brunch Burger\" of fried egg, bacon, and burger patty, along with regular fries.  Pros: 1. Fast food delivery from food order to table delivery 2. Great options for the vegetarian and carnivore alike :) 3. Modern atmosphere 4. Cool sauces to try with your burger at each table   Cons: 1. Cleanliness (that particular night there were uncleared tables spotted everywhere, including the people next to us who had left 20-25 minutes before their places were cleared) 2. Average tasting food. Great ideas and options, nothing to be named special. (I expected more with Bobby Flay's name on it) 3. Hamburger buns are basic sesame seed buns 4. Customer service is.....ehhhh.  Am I being critical? Maybe. Would I eat here again? Maybe. For a cool place to try on the strip, it's worth it. Although, I'd recommend Strip Burger if you're wanting a really delicious place for burgers in Vegas.",

Wife wanted a burger and beer so we came here on a Friday night around 9 pm.  We sat at the bar.  Service was great and so were the burgers.  I got the LA Burger, med rare, and got them to add the roasted peppers to it which was fantastic.  Wife got the black and blue burger.  We got the can't decide fries and onion ring combo for a side.  Everything was good with the exception of the wife's burger was way over salted.  The patty was super salted, then with the salty bacon and salty blue cheese it was just too much.  However, the prices were very fair for the strip, the service was great, the fries were great, and my burger was good enough to keep it at 4 stars.",

    "text": "Despite a bit of a fiasco with Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill on my last trip to Vegas, I knew that I wanted to try this place when I came back because a) I love burgers and b) I just can't quit Bobby Flay no matter how hard I try.  When you walk in the place, there are no servers to help you and no signs explaining how the system works, so we just grabbed a seat. A minute or two later, a waiter told us to go to the front to order and *then* sit down. Well, great, but couldn't there have been some indication of this somewhere?  Anyway, I got the Philly (\"Provolone, griddled onions, hot peppers\") and asked for it \"crunchified\" (which just means they stack plain chips in there). We were attempting to decide between fries and onion rings when we noticed the Undecided option, which allows you to get a combination of two items from: Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and Buttermilk Onion Rings. It's a pretty sweet deal for $5.  The food arrived about 10 minutes later and it was good. Really good. The onion rings, sparse as they were, rank among the best I've ever had, while the fries were definitely above average and the accompanying dipping sauces were a perfect accompaniment. The burger itself was surprisingly delicious and impressively cooked to medium (it was pink and juicy in the middle). I guess my one complaint would be that the onions and hot peppers were cut a little too thickly for a hamburger, as several bites were just dominated by these items (while other bites didn't have any at all, essentially).  I also ordered the Milkshake of the Month, which was Dulce de Leche and it was glorious. Rich and creamy, it contained an intense caramel flavor that was impossible to resist.",

It's right on the strip in front on the Mandarin Oriental, so very decent location.  The decor is kind of a throw back, but very cute.  Communal tables and chairs, kind of lunch counter/dinner type setting, very neat.    The menu has a vast array of different types if burgers, a brunch burger that adds an egg, crunch burgers where you can add chips to pretty much any burger and so on.   I ordered a basic cheeseburger and fries. It was very delicious.  The fries are nice and crunchy.  They have so many sauces, but I'm just a simple kind of girl, simple food, etc.  I'm not a fan of sauces, a whole lot of extra stuff on my burger.  I was glad they made it just how j asked for it.

    "text": "My friends and I were starving and we wanted a good burger. This place came up in a search, we didn't even know it was Bobby flays.   Flat out one of the beast burgers I've ever had, especially for the price. To start it was perfectly cooked at a medium rare temperature. You would be surprised how few places can get this right, including higher end burger joints. I would say this place is more of a fast casual dining experience. They keep it simple here, American cheese on most of the burgers and a simple sesame bun that is soft and delicious. Now, I hear people scoffing at the American cheese, but there is nothing wrong with it on a classic American cheeseburger and it in fact has the best texture and creaminess for a great burger.   The fries were okay, nothing special. The onion rings were good, maybe a little to big to eat. The burger sauce is what I would recommend. The chipotle is way too strong, if you opt for this sauce you might want to cut it 1/10 with normal ketchup. Even though the shakes are $6 I def recommend. I had the basic vanilla bean and it was one of the best I've ever had. Vanilla gets a bad rap, the word being almost synonymous with boring. This is quite unfair. Vanilla is one of the most complex flavor a out there and deserves a chance to shine.  If you're looking for a simple, yet great burger under $10 then bobbys burger palace is it. For my money is better than five guys and way better than in and out.",

We'd had a few typical vegas mixed drinks already that day and as most anyone could vouch for, the typical drink is junk ingredients and alcohol. We had ordered the Long Island. After getting to the last sip, my friend and I proclaimed this was our best drink all day!!! Our adorable bartender, Caleb, said he could do even better.  He mixed up something so divinely perfect - fresh and delicious.  Needless to say, our afternoon was fantastic after that - we even came back the next day to double it up on Caleb's specialty!",

Myself and two other people went here because of my obsession with Food Network/Bobby Flay and got three different burgers and all of shared the same question, \"when were we going to come back again?\".  I personally had the New Mexico Angus Burger that was topped with green chilies, queso and pickled onions. It was cooked exactly how I asked and was extremely flavorful.  Great fries and sauce that came with the burger.  We also had a few drinks from the bar and were satisfied. Staff was friendly and wait times seemed normal. Prices are very reasonable especially with it being on the strip.  I would recommend this to anyone to stop by for a quick bite to eat while on the strip.   Only one downside:  They said they sold the #flayforall shirts and they told me to come back the next day because they we getting a shipment but when I got back there they were not in stock. :(",

The sweet potato fries were delicious, but the onion brings were a little too thick for me. It had a heavy buttermilk coat on them and I am not a fan of heavy batter.

They have a great menu to pick from and you can get any burger crunchified. Meaning, they put potato chips on the burger, and it is free. I selected the palace classic with grilled onions. Brian went with the Vegas and made it crunchified. Amazing, juicy, dripping with love, this burger was perfect. I know that sounds extreme, but it was in all fairness, perfection. On top of everything, the staff was extremely friendly and always smiling. Everyone looked like they love their job!  I am elated that we found this burger place and we will definitely frequent it every time we go to Vegas.  If you want an awesome burger and love Bobby Flay, then go to Bobby's Burger palace!",

They got one of my group member's order wrong, insisted it was right, and when we told them no, it wasn't, they finally refunded us the difference and got us the right burger. Someone in my group went into the bathroom and reported back that the toilet tank had no lid, despite the fact that the bathroom requires a code to get in (probably to avoid overuse by non-diners or to avoid vandalism). I got the veggie burger, and I was actually surprised by how bad it was: it has quinoa, mushrooms, and chickpeas in the patty, three things I love, but somehow, the patty just tasted like actual dirt. I didn't even finish the burger. I also got the onion rings on the side, and the coating was quite peppery, which I personally didn't enjoy. Also didn't finish those. Everyone else in my party seemed to at least enjoy their burgers, but we all agreed afterwards that it wasn't worth the money and that we won't be repeat customers.",

    "text": "Wow, good as it gets.  See that photo with the chips on the burger, go for it.  What a textural delight with those chips.  Yes that's just something on the burger along with the other condiments. So sit back and let the burger tantalize your pallet and senses.  While in Las Vegas my wife and I decided to do a burger tour.  Bobby's was just on of the stops we made and it was well worth the walk to this restaurant.  After a horrible visit to Guy Fieri's burger joint (see my review there, not good) we almost didn't go to another celebrity restaurant.  Good thing we decided to check out the Burger Palace.  The onion rings...well they were special with a lite coating of flour and rice flour made the crust very light yet the  onions were completely cooked; a perfect combination.  Usually union rings have a very heavy and thick crust and when you bite it the onion slips out of the crust because the onion is not cooked.  Not these onion rings.  The pair of the burger and the rings is one of the best we've had.  The burger, one of my top favorites, is one I would recommend and I will visit again when we are in Las Vegas again.  The milieu was upbeat modern and welcoming with the windows facing the Strip, perfect for people watching and who doesn't like that.  This was a relaxing place to enjoy a great burger, a tall soda and people watching.    MANGA BURGER",

After noticing that Bobby Flay's swanky restaurant was closed for lunch, we were so suprised to find this new burger place of his! Prices are great, service top notch and the food out of this world good! The man had the burger of the month: Cheyenne Burger Smoked Cheddar, BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Shoestring Onion Rings which he loved. The deal here is, that you can get any burger \"crunchified\" meaning with crushed potato chips for free, so do it, it's good. The kids meal was also amazingly good and a generous portion, great fries! I had the crunch salad, veggies, romaine, tortillas, white cheddar, balsamic and added grilled onions, and pickled peppers, also got the meyer lemon honey mustard, avocado salsa and honey mustard horseradish on the side. There was just so much going on in the salad, so many colors, textures and flavors, it was amazing! Prices are more than fair, burgers and salads are under $10, sides around $3, great deal, especially in Vegas! Seriously, this place needs to take off and be the next McDonalds, the enterior is super cool, futuristic diner with plenty of innovative ketchups, dips and sauces on each table, servers are cool, Truely in love with Bobby's!",

    "text": "Really disappointing.  If you're opening a burger joint with a chef as famous as Bobby Flay, I'd think you should be able to get the burger basics pretty much perfect.  Not so.  My son ordered a medium well basic beef burger with American cheese, pickles and lettuce.  Pretty simple, right?  Not only did the cashier have a REALLY HARD time with that basic order (we had to repeat it three times as she tried to find their closest signature specialty burgers and then figure out what key ingredients she needed to remove-- nightmare) ... but my son's burger was medium RARE (not nearly medium well as ordered) and no lettuce to be found.  Also, the fries were all messed up--clumped together, leaving them inconsistent in texture (some clumps were raw while other fries were damn near burnt).  My L.A. turkey burger with avocado \"relish\" was O.K.  First off, don't say \"avocado relish\" if you're just going to place one sliver of fresh avocado on top.  That's called \"a sample of freshly sliced avocado\" ... and the turkey was not well seasoned as you might imagine.  My love's salad was pitiful (could have done better at a cheap buffet) ... but if you're not going to have a signature veggie patty at a burger joint, then at least have a couple of really solid salads with some decent proteins.  On a positive note, the sweet potato fries were terrific (along with the dipping sauces) and the presentation was fabulous (along with some creative ambiance and seating design).  But, for nearly fifty bucks two sandwiches, a salad and one side of fries, I think I could find a better way to spend $50 on a much better meal in Vegas.",

There were 4 of us and not a single person was thrilled with their meal. It was just a burger. You could get a more flavorful burger at In-N-Out, Five Guys or in your own backyard. You can get a phenomenal burger at Guy Fieri's, Gordon Ramsey's, Burger Bar or local faves like Bachi & Fuku.  The strawberry shake was good.   We are locals who enjoy visiting the strip. But we just can't recommend Bobby's Burger Palace.",

The rings are poor, but thick. Wife had fries and a Bobby Blue burger. Said it was also salty but she liked it. I sent it back and complained to the manager. He offered to replace the burger, but my taste buds are all screwed now. Said he would comp our return meal but we leave town Monday and quite frankly I'm afraid to try it again.   $38.00 for 2 burgers, 2 sides and 2 drinks. Yikes!  Critics say the food channel chefs over season their food. There may be something to this!",

The menu choices looked great.  The big problem was everyone's burger tasted like it had been soaked in SALT.   They were so salty they were inedible.  I kept biting on a different side of the burger to try to find a bite that didn't taste like a salt lick.  I gave up half way through. The French fries were completely covered in salt as well.  All the ingredients looked superb, just ruined by a pound of salt per plate.   Such a shame.  I had vitamin water from the drink bay and it was rancid tasting.  I tried to get another selection but there was no other non carbonated choice.   I wanted to love this place and the staff ruined a great idea.",

    "text": "Short version: overpriced, mediocre burger, fries and 2 onion rings, and a really bad malt.  Such a disappointment considering it is Bobby Flay's restaurant.  Long version: Not impressed!  Everything is ala carte.  The cheapest burger is $8.50. This is the cheeseburger with lays potato chips on it.  I had that and added lettuce (no extra charge).  I ordered the mixed regular fries and onion rings $5 ($1 extra), black and white malt with double malt $6.50(no extra), a soda $2.50.  My husband got the regular cheese burger $9.50 (go figure, it was $1 more than the chip burger).  It was supposed to have lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle.  First the malt came out.  It looked like chocolate milk with some ice crystals in it.  I flagged down the girl that took our order (she was cleaning tables in her down time from taking orders).  I asked her if that is how the malt was supposed to look.  She frowned at it and said \"no\" and said she knew what I was looking for and would make sure it was right. She took it and came back little later with another one that was slightly thicker, but still far too running to call a malt.  So I explained how thick I thought the malt would be and she agreed and said it was the double malt that was causing the problem.  She brought another.  It was a little thicker, but more of a thin shake than a malt.  I gave up and just kept it.  Then my burger, fries, and 2 onion rings (yes I said 2 onion rings) cames out (my husband's did not).  Maybe 5-7 mins later, his burger came.  They brought him the same chip burger that they brought me!  At this point, we weren't sending it back.  The burgers didn't have condiments on them and it didn't taste like they had any seasoning on them.  On the table is there their signature burger sauce, Chipotle ketchup, mustard, and regular ketchup.  The burger sauce was EXTREMELY salty and the Chipotle ketchup was vinegary (I know, I just made that word up).  I didn't like the fries, but my husband said they were ok. The 2 onion rings were good. I expected soooo much more from a place bearing Bobby Flay's name.  It was just a burger and just some fries, oh and 2 onion rings, and a really bad malt.  We will not be back.",

There was a time when Inn-n-Out or Five guys would be the default for burgers, no longer, Bobby's Burger Palace is above and beyond... new default. It's about 10$ for the burger with no sides, but given a normal cup of coffee at Starbucks is 3$, I imagine a chunk of that is Vegas location tax. My personal favorite is the L.A. with Jalepeno's but the Bobby Blue is amazing if you like Blue Cheese (non chunky) dressing.",

Ordered onion rings and fry combo for around five dollars and received three onion rings which were big, but really only three with the fries.

I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger medium rare and it was perfect. It was one of the best Burgers I've ever had. Second, the sweet potato fries were delicious. Finally, I loved the different ketchups they offer. For a gourmet burger I think the price was totally in line. The Manager Jeff checked on me 2 times to make sure I was happy. Great job. I realize most locals will not come here because of the location and parking but I parked in Aria self parking and walked to the strip and it was very convenient. With so many good burger places in that area alone I would highly recommend coming here. I will be back soon and when family is in from back East I know they are Bobby Flay fans we will come here.",

Now for the bad stuff  the fries were bland the onion rings just OK as were the dipping sauces plus in what world is an order of half and half (fries and rings) made up of two onion rings and a bunch of fries. You pay a buck more for half and half and end up paying 50 a ring they aren't that good. Don't care for the community table set up either but that's just not our style and the bourbon and vanilla shake was awful just not a well balanced shake. So over all I'd get the burgers again but to go and no sides",

We watch all of the food network cooking shows and we try to eat at as many of their restaurants that we can find. Don't waste your time or your money coming here. We went to Guy Fieri ' s restaurant last night and it was fantastic.  Next on the list is trying Giada's restaurant. I hope she has put more into her restaurant than Bobby has.

I do wish it would have come with more cole slaw...there was barely any on it. The sweet potato fries were crisp and the honey mustad sauce it comes with had a nice kick to it. All in all a satisfying meal.  Staff was a bit slow and forgot our beer initially.  I enjoyed there were different sauces on the table to choose from. Chipotle ketchup and jalapeno sauce were pretty good.  I'd definitely come back again as it's great for a quick meal while out on the strip.",

    "text": "It's no secret that i love burgers [and Bobby Flay] but sadly I didn't love his burger. :( And it's unfortunate because this resto had all the makings to be a great burger joint. Prime location, celebrity chef, decent prices, my hopes were high.   First off, getting there can be a bit tricky. I'm sure there's an easy way but since when do I ever do anything the easy way? Haha! (Sorry I'm getting off the point). So my advice, don't do what I did which was self park at The Aria. You'll do quite a lot of walking thru the casino to find it and unless you're specifically looking for it, you won't just happen to stumble upon it.   Lines are long but they move quickly. And in that time you get a chance to go over the menu. The employees manning the cashiers are very efficient and friendly. That's always a plus with a busy location.   So I picked the burger that jumped out at me. The L.A burger of course. Can you guess why? ;) I get teased quite often for my love of avocados. What can I say, I'm a sucker for all things green. ; ) After the first bite I realized there was nothing I really liked or thought was outstanding about my burger. The funny thing is I was starving when I went. You know how ppl say food tastes better when you're hungry. Not the case here. Disappointing and definitely not what I had expected from Bobby Flay. :/",

    "text": "I came here to experience Bobby Flay's obsession with burgers and after having the best burger experience ever at Burger by Gordon Ramsey I had high expectations and Bobby didn't disappoint.   I order the Brunch Burger with turkey instead of a beef patty and a half and half combo featuring sweet potato fries and onion rings. The burger featured a fried egg, bacon and the usual burger trimmings and it was delicious as it but since Bobby offers a slew of different burger sauces and ketchups I tried a chipotle sauce/ketchup on my burger and it kicked it up a notch. Juicy and flavorful the actual burger meat was perfect making this another successful burger experience.    The sweet potato fries were good, not too crunchy or soft and when dipped in the chipotle ketchup they were delicious but the onion rings were dried rings of death, over cooked and mostly batter. I couldn't find any onions and the reason for my 4 not 5 star review. I would definitely come back here again to give the onion rings another chance and to try a different burger for a new burger experience.",

I thought a little reward was in order so we found Bobby's and were happy! He loves burgers and we like Bobby Flay so why not.   Procedure: Walk in, order and pay at the counter. Take your number and find a seat. You can build your own or choose from a list. You can also pick the way you want the your patty cooked.   What we ordered:   The LA Burg, sub pimento cheese = DEEE-RISH-CIOUS! I remember watching one of Bobby's backyard cooking shows where he made a burger with pimento cheese so I decided to try it. The gentleman taking our order was so nice in helping me make the substitution. Avocado relish wasn't sour- tasted like avocado with a little seasoning. The pickle that comes on the side with the burger was really really good. We easily split it in half.  Bucket of mixed fries = Too much! Granted, we ate White Castle about 3 hours earlier. I can't see myself eating a whole burger plus fries by myself. Russet potatoes for the regular version and sweet potato. They lose their crunchiness if you leave them out. I suggest eating these prior to the burger to guarantee optimal freshness.   I would like to come again and try another burger. It is a gourmet burger joint and meant for those who don't necessarily want a ginormous Guy Fieri sized messy monstrosity.... Though you can order a huge burger if you'd like...",

    "text": "Bobby's Burger Palace was advertised on the TV in our hotel room PLUS my friends hyped it up, so I just had to try it. Bobby Flay? How could I say no?  Surprisingly, I was disappointed by my meal. My friend and I were joking that the water was the best part of the meal because the burgers were so salty. For me, it was the giant deli pickle on the side. I ordered the Dallas Burger ($9) which has coleslaw, Monterey Jack cheese, BBQ Sauce, and pickles. The burger itself was pretty good. I also tried some of the Brunch Burger, which has smoked bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg... but I agreed with all three of my friends who ordered that burger that it was way too salty.  I like that you can \"crunchify\" your burger, which just means they add some thin potato chips inside your burger to add an awesome sounding CRUNCH. The chips add extra salt to your burger so watch out.  The sweet potato fries ($4) were underwhelming (but the perfect amount of salt) and its honey mustard dipping sauce was super watery and did not go well with the fries. Speaking of sauces, I liked the Chipotle sauce with my burger, but stay away from the Burger sauce, ironically.  Lastly, the Cactus Pear Margarita tasted... interesting. Maybe it's because I don't know what actual cactus pear tastes like. It looks super cool AND you get to keep the cup, but I would not recommend this drink unless you are feeling adventurous.  I'm actually very glad I tried this place out, but I would not come back again.",

Ordered the combo fries and sweet potato fries.  I'd probably just order the fries next time, since they were delish.  I like my fries crispy, which is what you get here.  I like that the ketchup, mustard, chipotle ketchup, BBQ sauce and jalapeno hot sauce are available on the side.  This allows you to control what and how much you add to your burger.  I liked the chipotle ketchup and as expected the jalapeno hot sauce had a nice kick to it.  It's not the biggest burger in Vegas, but it's solid.",

Ok, maybe it's a slight stretch to call it fast food... i.e. burgers are made to order, you sit down, they bring to you, there's no play land, etc. So maybe not technically fast food, but whatever. It's quick, really good, and cheap. Yes. Yes. Yes.   Went here two days in a row and got two different burgers (the Carolina and the New Mexico). Both were very good and I really want to try more now. Just trying to tow the line of if it's really acceptable to have a burger from this place more than 3 times in a week. Oh well, who's counting?  Highly recommend. And I also recommend accepting if Bobby Flay is ever throwing a cook out and invites you over for a burger. And also grab me one, please. Thanks.   Oh, also: Pro tip: crunchify.

I decided after work today that I wanted a turkey burger for dinner so I preordered through the app. I got to BBP 10 mins later and had to wait in a 20 min line , when I got to the front my burger was very cold and I asked if they could remake it. They said yes and I waited another 30 mins and come to find out my new burger had just been sitting there and no one was going to bring it to me beside the bartender who actually cared and ended up being the one to bring it to me. I'm highly disappointed with the customer service here.",

You order at the front and then you sit at either a counter or a cafeteria area and they bring the food to you.  This burger has a chique feel to it, with chips offered to put on the burger for an extra crunch.  They actually have a decent selection of beer as well for not outrageous prices.    If you're looking for a nice afternoon lunch or low key dinner, come here.  It won't blow you away, but neither will it disappoint.  It certainly won't break the bank like other strip restaurants.",

It tasted like a shake... It's just not worth the money in the end. I had a better experience eating a burger poolside at the Vdarra... you just expect more from a 'brand name' burger.

We moved on before it opened. :(  We are back for work and stopped by while walking the strip. This did not disappoint. The burgers have a nice char which give them the perfect crunch. Ooh you can add chips, now it's a double crunch.  Bacon Crunch Burger. Well double crunch like I said and crisp bacon. Now it's triple crunch, booyah.  Beef Brunch Burger. You can not control were the yolk flows, bushy beards beware. You take anything that is good and make it better with a runny yolk dripping over it. (OK I would not put an egg on my ribeye)  Onion Rings are buttermilk battered and there is lots of pepper in the batter. This could be an award winning southern fried chicken batter. The burger was perfectly seasoned, but you add the bacon and it was to salty for my wife and boarder line for me. If not for this it would be 5 stars. A shout out to Angel, our host at the bar. Thanks for encouraging us to drink our water before we left. It's easy to dehydrate in this desert climate when your not drinking. Dehydration and drinking is an Oh Sh!t tomorrow morning.",

I sat at the bartender and he was very friendly.  I had a desire for a mojito (which was not listed on the menu) but he was able to whip one up.  I went for the classic fries with the onion rings and regular fries.  The burger was very nicely done with a great roll which I topped off with Bobby's steak sauce (which also goes great with the fries).  The onion rings use a batter with a distinct pepper flavor.  There are also a great selection of televisions so you can watch sports while eating.  Definitely worth a visit to avoid the buffets.",

Did not care for any of the 5 sauces you could add to the burger. My wife had the Dallas, she liked the slaw on it, but the sauce tasted bitter. Needed something vinegary to cut the richness. The fries were very disappointingly average and limp. The onion rings needed more crunch. My wife and I went around 1:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday afternoon, and there were only 2 waitresses to serve the entire restaurant. They were scurrying around like squirrels. They also needed an additional person to take orders. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Give me In N Out Burgers anyday.",

    "text": "We needed a break from hotel catering food or pricy foods in the hotel restaurant. I actually really wanted In n Out burger that was only about a half a mile walk; however, I guess it was in the sketchy area and it was too hot to walk. Bobby's Burger Palace was next door to the Aria, and it became more attractive by the minute since it was close and I have never tried it before.  There was a time when I thought Bobby Flay was pretty flay for a white guy. Then, he got on TV way too much and exchanging toothy smiles with Giada and divorced my fave prosecutor Alex Cabot aka Stephanie March. Not flay. Not flay at all.  However, the burger palace was aaight! First off, looking at all the prices of the burger at $9.50, it was very refreshing. They could just put one price on the top that all burgers are $9.50 instead of listing the same price on each burger. It's pricy for burger but it's Bobby Flay right? Plus, around here, it was a bargain. It's probably the only thing under $10!  My business associates were buying lunch though I insisted on buying. Now, the price got even better for me. I was sick of red meat so instead of getting half a burger, I actually tried the turkey burger LA style or California style. I forgot truly but it was that type of style with avocado, tomatoes, etc. It sounded light for a burger; thus, it sounded good to me. My two colleagues got the brunch one and the blue burger.  We ordered upfront and it was awesome that you could order beer if you wanted to. We were eating during work so we couldn't drink but that was great that we had the option. Oh, they also had Fanta ginger ale on the soda machine. Nice!!   The ambience was slick and modern, with communal table. Though I have never been a fan of communal table, this one was okay as it was pretty spread out and spacious. The tables had a meandering type of design to it with a good flow and not just a big rectangular picnic table type.  The order was done pretty quick and soon we got our burgers. The sides were huge so I would recommend sharing. The two guys I were with couldn't finish theirs and we actually gave one untouched onion ring order to people who sat next to us. Oh, communal eating...  My burger was tasty and juicy and it was quite flay for a white turkey burger. I loved it though the bun actually didn't look so appetizing. It was pale like Bobby and if it had hair, it would have been red. I prefer those golden glistening with butter toasted brioche or potato buns. This sesame topped bun tasted good but looked just okay. My colleague devoured his brunch burger and didn't say much except mhmh. Jerry, my other colleague, was a hard nut to crack and he said he liked this better than In n Out. He went there yesterday without asking me and he said he preferred Bobby's any day. Whoaa I was surprised but they were kind of different burgers. Jerry's burger came raw and blood was dripping all over though he ordered medium well. He wasn't pleased but he just ate it and he still said it was awesome.  The sweet potato fries were really really good as well as the onion rings. The malt looked good as well. I wish I ordered some but that would put me to sleep during workshops in the afternoon.  Not bad, Bobby. I guess I wouldn't ask for a throw down or try to beat Bobby Flay, unless it is with a paddle.",

You can tell that everything is made from scratch and all of the flavor profiles are spot on. It's also refreshing to have a rare or medium-rare burger in a fast food type setting. The fries were obviously fresh made and were much better than In-N-Out fries because they are cut thicker, therefore offering better potato flavor. Yes the prices are a bit steep for \"fast food\" but if you understand that you get what you pay for, I'd say it was a worthy treat.",

My wife is a HUGE Food Network fan, so we are eating at all the Food Network stars' restaurants. My favorite was Guy Fairi's (5-Star) and my wife said, \"Wait until we get to Bobby Flays' Burger Palace!\" Well, once again, what a disappointment! The place was nearly empty, the floors were filthy, bathroom was horrific, not to mention the food had a difficult time measuring up to McDonald's or Hardee's. However, a waitress came to our table, noticed my wife didn't eat her meal, and took that meal off our bill. Kudos to her! Bobby, if you read these reviews, you may want to visit your Burger Palace more often. Disappointed.......",

Bobby Flay is supposed to be this amazing chef and unfortunately this restaurant is lacking some serious flavor but I was starving and ate the fries.

The onion rings were literally dripping with oil and my mom had to return them. The customer service is amazing and they refunded us for the onion rings that is why I gave the 3 stars food deserved 1 star.",

    "text": "This place offers several varieties of really good burgers with toppings that aren't common in most burger chains, such as Fresno red chiles and pickled red onions.  They even offer a brunch burger topped with a sunny-side up egg and bacon.  The burger I ordered was cooked nicely, juicy and flavorful with a good quality bun and fresh toppings.  I like that all their burgers come with the offer of \"crunchifying\" them- adding potato chips as a topping for no extra charge.  It makes the burger a little salty but adds a nice texture. The french fries and sweet potato fries are also worth ordering.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was the drinks.  The place offers three flavors of spiked milkshakes.  I ordered one, but I am positive there was NO alcohol in it at all.  I am a lightweight, and if there had been alcohol in the milkshake I would have noticed it.  However, in a glass of milkshake that was approximately 20 ounces, there wasn't even one shot of alcohol.  I felt ripped off that I paid nine dollars for a regular milkshake.  If you go, definitely try the burgers and sides but don't bother ordering a spiked milkshake because it is a waste of money.",

    "text": "I am still in a state of shock! First of all let me begin by saying that I am a long time yelp user although I have never contributed to any reviews before. Tonight, I went to Bobby's Burger after reading scores of positive reviews, and the fact that I was starving and my brother who works across the street was waiting for me to pick him up. I also want to add that the the burger and fries that I was having was absolutely fantastic!!   It all started going down hill as I was finishing around half my blu cheese burger when I needed a refill on my soda, so I got up to get my self refill and by the time that I got back all of my food was taken away by one of the servers!! When I got back to the table another server saw the look of astonishment on my face and asked me what the problem was so I explained and at least he offered to cook me another burger but at that point I was already getting texts that my brother was waiting for me so to wait again for another cooked burger and then to sit down and eat again was not an option!! I even made a complaint to the cashier and he just gave me the \"oh well\" look. Needless to say that I left very upset after paying over $17 for what really was a great burger and not being able to enjoy it, I honestly felt (and told the cashier) that I was being rushed out of the restaurant as I thought maybe they were closing and just wanted to rush me out.  Honestly, like I said before, the burger tasted great but now I'm not sure if I would return to this establishment again and if I do, either I would need to carry my 1/2 eaten burger and fries with me to refill my drink or sit right next to the soda fountain.  I am so upset!",

Great staff, especially the cashier as he was knowledgeable and kind. Very afforable. Glad I got to taste some of Bobby's creations-second hand but you get the idea. Yummy! Clean restaurant and staff continuously cleaning tables and going around area to be sure.",

The reason I gave it 5 stars is because the service was exceptional. I wasn't sure if I should order the philly burger because of the hot peppers and Jason who was taking our order offered to let me try a pepper before I ordered and it was too hot for me and it kept getting worse and Jason took pitty on me and got me a water and let me order the burger without the peppers. I later asked for the manager so I could compliment Jason for the service and found out he is the manager. That being said it is no wonder it was a good experience since they lead by example.

We had a hard time finding this place, no one around has addresses posted.  I would go again. Loved the potato chips on the burger- free on any burger!",

I didn't knock off a star for this bc it gave me time to study the menu and cashier was super nice. It wasn't her fault the mgr never sent anyone to help her. I ordered the chicken burger with bleu cheese and bacon. I mistakenly thought it would be ground chicken, but it was a grilled chicken breast. Even better. It was HUGE. Fries are separate, no combos on this menu. I ordered cheese fries. Also HUGE. I  could have split them with a friend if I had known the order would be so big. Another friend ordered the onion rings. This was literally enough for a family. Biggest rings I have ever seen. Nice atmosphere. Servers friendly. Drinks are self-serve except for the lemonade. The servers keep you refilled on the lemonade. I was surprised that you could not order grilled mushrooms for your burger. Simply not an option. Definitely worth stopping by. I ate the sandwich and half of the fries and samples an onion ring. I was full for the rest of the night. And believe me when I say this is no easy feat. Seriously.",

Has a style if it's own. Ordering is straight forward. Burger  -  Drink and sides. Cost though I  just think was a bit high, but in the end so worth it. My first time here so I went basic with a little chip crunch on top. Solid Dark Chocolate Milk Shake and the mix of sweet potato fries and regular fries.  I will start with he fries.  Delectable dish and I had the dijon and horseradish sauce.  Spectacular! The dark chocolate milkshake was a proverbial happy punch to the stomach that was so good, I wanted more.. Smooth and not overly chocolate.  Just the right amount.  Now the burger, I do love burgers and I have to shout out that the best one I have ever had is at the El Corral in Bogata Colombia.  The beef standards there are so much different and better.  However, BBP does a stellar job of setting the Angus beef standard  there and giving us good quality beef.",

    "text": "SUMMARY: In need of fine-tuning, rough edges persist...prices of a gourmet burger establishment with the service and atmosphere of an upscale In-n-Out. I still recommend Burger Bar and Holstein's over this place.   I ordered the Carolina Cheeseburger, and although a truly original and outstanding sauce offering, I was dismayed to learn that the burger lacks any traditional vegetables.  It's a patty with cheese and sauce.  The tastes? Great.   But to me, it is still incomplete as a burger without traditional garnish.  The onion rings were good, superior to Burger Bar's and still not as good as Top's and TwoHeys (Pasadena/Alhambra). The milk shake? Small, but not bad.  I had to ask for Thousand Island or an equivalent sauce for the onion rings. I had to ask for a slice of tomato and lettuce from the help.  What came was a lifeless piece of romaine and a tomato that for all intents appeared to have a bite taken out of it.  No taste. I'd expect nothing but the freshest and finest tomatoes and lettuce at a BF establishment, as would you. The patty was  excellent.  The air quality is low.  The stench of burger grease permeates the air.  Somehow, this is a turn-off, and I don't care if it is a burger place.  Cafeteria style seating didn't work out well due to people desiring privacy.  The bathroom wasn't really tidy either.   What the place needs is for the owner to come back and candidly (somehow) sample the recipes and fine-tune the entire offering.",

Cons: It can be a little pricey for a burger and side but I think it's worth it.  I came here yesterday, Monday 5/25/15, with my boyfriend for a quick lunch. This is my second time at Bobby's Burger Palace (the first time was last August, while we were pretty buzzed and wandering the strip for a place to eat... stumbled upon Bobby's due to the nice big sign and bright enticing lights inside). Upon arriving (sober this time, by the way) it was a very short wait and we were able to decide on our orders before the people in front of us were done. Their menu is blown up and displayed on the wall so you can conveniently choose a meal -- divided by burgers, sides and drinks, nice and simple. I ordered the Brunch which consisted of a fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I chose certified angus beef as my protein (there's also ground turkey and chicken breast). I also got a half and half side -- fries and onion rings. We sat at these cool curvy diner type tables next to another couple. It took maybe 10 minutes for our food to arrive. You can watch the cooks through an opening between the kitchen and dining area. I knew which burger was mine as soon as the cook placed it on the counter. They have different sauces at the table that you can try. I tried them all on my fries and really liked the jalapeno sauce. The burger was cooked medium well, just like I like it. My boyfriend and I each got our own sides but decided in the end we could've shared one because they're pretty big (I took our left over fries and snacked on them at the penny slots). Come here if you're craving burgers and don't mind spending a little more for the flavor.",

    "text": "Amazing, delicious, scrumptious, AMAZING!!!!  Maybe I'm just really happy because this place felt like a god send for are wallet while we were in Vegas.  I had the LA burger and my husband had the Bobby blue with a side of fries. Delicious!  The prices were fair which had us smiling because finding food in Vegas with reasonable price is not an easy thing, its either go broke or starve.    burgers $9.50 sides $4 shakes $6  The menu is simple, descriptive, and easy to order from. The burgers are cooked to order and fast, to your desired doneness, with good portions, and a good variety to choose from.   The line moves fast and service is friendly and professional.  its casual seating so just find a table.   this is casual Americana done right, so if you want a really good burger that won't have your wallet singing the blues, COME CHECK IT OUT!",

Regardless of that I will be going back to this place again and again! Just might have to get two... LOL",

After sitting down to enjoy our meal we were greeted by the manager who refunded us $10 that we were mistakenly overcharged. This impressed me greatly. Our food arrived promptly and looked fantastic. Our server explained the variety of special sauces available. The food was amazing. Well seasoned burgers but slightly overdone. Fries were cooked perfectly, and accompanying sauces were great. I truly enoyed all BBP had to offer including the great service. After comparing our burger the philly stood out with the grilled onions and peppers. Simply amazing.",

So good I'll make sure we get back there before our trip ends.  The staff were all incredibly friendly and attentive during our 2:00pm visit and where most places tend to overcook, the team here produced an absolutely perfect medium rare burger.    If people are looking for a gourmet truffle burger topped foie gras, I can see why they'd be disappointed.  But if you're looking for delicious food presented without attitude by smiling, helpful staff in a comfortable atmosphere (with phenomenal prices for Vegas!) look no further.",

A fairly long wait to get the food given the place was not busy.  When it comes, it was all messed up (missing food, wrong food).  I ordered a Bobby Blue burger and my wife the burger with egg.  Burgers were great.  However, my side of half and half fries and onion rings consisted of a bunch of fries and 2 little onion rings.  Bobby does not do math I guess because I think it should be called the 90/10 side (90 percent fries).  And even worse the fries were soggy and cold.  Plus, they seem like they had already been re-heated a few times judging by their dark brown color.",

A bit pricey for a burger but i don't mind throwing down $9.50 for a uniquely crafted burger cooked to my liking. Plus, this place is in a premium location (part of city center) so it's no wonder they are a little pricey. One of my favorite burgers is called the \"Vegas\" which has \"bbq crunch\" on it (aka bbq chips). Another unique creation i love is the \"Miami\" which is pressed (panini style) with ham and made up like a cordon bleu. My girlfriend loves the dark chocolate shake and has to quench her craving for it every time we go.",

    "text": "My wife and I are big fans of Chef B. Flay. We have had several meals at Mesa Grill in Las Vegas before moving here. Being from The San Francisco bay area, we haven't traveled to NYC to try his other restaurants. We were pleased to discover that he was opening a Bobby's Burger Palace on the Strip. We made our way into the spot, located on the Las Vegas Blvd (Strip) in front of the Aria hotel and casino at Harmon Blvd.   We were smart and went in on a weekday afternoon between lunch and dinner. There was plenty of seating, and the decor was as expected of Chef Flay. I would say our first visit was within the first few weeks of opening. As expected the menu was big, bold, and easy to read and make a decision.   My wife ordered the New Mexico burger, I had the Carolina burger. We ordered the sweet potato fries, and I tried a dark chocolate shake.  The burgers- 5 stars, perfectly cooked, great condiment pairings. The fries were very good, the Honey Mustard Horseradish sauce for the fries could make a flip flop tasty. The shake was amazing...the flavor was rich, bold, and pure chocolate heaven. Our first visit was 4.5 stars!    Last month a good friend flew in for a afternoon between stops, I picked him up and we only had time for a quick bite, then back to the airport. I told him he had to try these burgers. Again the wife and I, our friend headed to the strip. The restaurant was far busier than our first visit, still plenty of seating.    The burgers and fries again were a 5/5 stars. Our friend was pleased and also impressed with the quality of food.   The 1 star deduction is 100% related to service and dining room this time. The server who took our order did not look pleased to be employed in this day of economic status. She was distracted, in a horrible mood, and was not paying attention to the customers. Her appearance was frumpy (dumpy) very lazy. The dining room floor was quite messy, and there was plenty of staff working that could have spot swept the floor. I will say the tables were clean, the table top condiments were full and clean. I just observed the floors were covered in debris.     If you want a quality burger experience, then head to Bobby's Burger Palace! You will not be disapointed...Its pricy for a burger, but you taste that quality, and I have no problem paying for GOOD food. Thank you Chef Flay, we are hoping for a Bar American to launch in Vegas...hint hint",

Lots of interesting sauces on the table to add to your burger.   They don't have a kids menu but they we opted for the griddle cheese sandwich which was also good. A tad pricey for its size (almost $8 or $9 for sandwich size bread) - but it's Vegas right? Kids also had 2 milkshakes - the vanilla & chocolate & the dark chocolate. Both were very good - dark chocolate the better of the two if u want ur chocolate fix. Also a bit pricey though at $7 a shake.   Overall though a good meal even if it was an expensive burger place compared to others.",

Now I dont know if the staff on the clock get free food like some places will give to there members once a day, that's fine but they had lots of free food and not only that they went to tell the cook and the cook was trying to be low key and made there order right away as for us who paid for our food had to wait some time, once we finally got our food it was disappointing the burger meat was so dry ! Like wow the buns kinda burnt. Fries not the best only good thing was the mint shake honestly. It's so sad I compared it to Red Robin because in this fight booby lost. Red Robin's burgers 100 times better! Forget the food though it was so sad to see someone hard work go to waist! I don't know who is running this place the manager but he needs to get his staff on training asap! It's horrible I wouldn't be surprised if this places shuts down within a year! To the manger seriously you need a lot of work done on your employees they are just not trained good! Sorry good luck with that!!",

    "text": "Background: Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) is easily my favorite celebrity chef burger chain. I was introduced to BBP from his locations in Maryland so naturally i was excited to see one pop up in Vegas. As of right now it's the only one west of the Mississippi River. Anyone who has watched the food network in the past 10 years knows that Bobby Flay is known for his sauces and his moniker \"the sauce is the boss\" this bodes True to life with the food at his burger palace.   The food: I've had just about every burger on the menu and my favorite are the BBQ based concoctions: the Dallas and the Carolina. However, no matter what burger you decide on it's always better when you add bacon and crunchify it! It's so crazy that it took a world renowned chef to make famous what we all did when we were kids and put potato chips in our sandwich. 10yr olds idea but a $1,000,000.00 one at that.   At each table there is an array of Bobby'ssignature sauces ranging from chipotle ketchup, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and of course my favorites; the fry sauce and burger sauce.  I almost feel guilty slathering the burger in all the different sauces because the burger taste awesome all by itself. They are always well seasoned and cooked to medium perfection each time I've ordered them.   I love this place..  Crunchify my brother!!",

There wasn't much in the way of seasoning, not salty like one review said.  The patty on both burgers came out exactly like we requested.  My husband had the LA but he with guacamole and added the green sauce to it and said it was delicious.  I had the American with bacon and it was great.  Very fresh taste and juicy.  We were greeted at the front by the friendliest and most helpful staff member.  She was so sweet when I had the after thought of adding bacon if it wasn't trouble and her response was of course you can add it, that's never a problem.  After we sat down my husband asked if there was a way we could get his bun without sesame seeds and she immediately made sure his burger was on a seedless bun. Very happy with lunch and would definitely eat here again",

So I was worried coming here that I may have the same experience. I was WRONG. I am glad to be wrong in cases like this. The food was cheap for food on the strip. Just slightly more expensive than shake shack for example.  We got the brunch burger and LA burger. Wife and both liked each alot. I would have preferred the bacon on mine a little more well done. We also ordered the split side option where we could get half onion rings and half sweet potato fries. It only gave us 4 onion rings to share but they are huge. We didn't finish them all. They were awesome. We also ordered a vanilla bean malt. Delightful. I actually preferred this malt to the shakes at burgr. The ones at burgr were just too rich. Sometimes you just need something classic. The special for this month was banana Nutella which I'm sure is amazing but we needed to save space for our trip over to the milk bar.",

I came with a party of 9 and while most of us were satisfied with our burgers, it was nothing special. The meat was overcooked (despite ordering it medium done) and dry. The price is fine although I would get a double double at in n out over this any day. Sides were better, especially the sweet potato fries and onion rings.

    "text": "Came in here because I wanted to try Bobby Flay's take on burgers. The prices didn't seem to crazy either.   As you enter, all their burgers are listed... the only one I remember is the one I got, which was the Crunch burger. It consisted of burger, cheese, potato chips, and from what I remember, I requested red onion, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise. We also ordered a side, \"half & half.\" Half fries, half onion rings.  We sat ourselves in a huge cafeteria like setting. Bright green and all... there were a variety of sauces at the table. From bbq sauce to a jalapeno sauce....  It did not take too long to cook, it was out in less than 10 minutes. The burger looked great. Potato chips stacked high, cheese melted to the burger patty, lettuce, beautiful red tomato and red onion. The mayonnaise was on the side. The half & half came with only 2 onion rings and a hefty amount of fries- I would hardly call that half.  My first bite into the burger, I noticed how juicy the meat was, as well as how salty. It was very salty for me. I took one more bite, and still the same. So I flagged down the girl who brought out our food and told her it was too salty for me. She informed me that, \"that is the Bobby Flay way\" and that they could remake it without the added salt. Which made me feel WONDERFUL!  While they did that, I asked for ranch for my uneven \"half & half.\"  Bobby Flay doesn't believe in RANCH?  Sad.  The 2 onion rings I got tasted good... the fries were pretty good too (but to pay a $1 more for half onion rings & half fries was not worth what I got.)  My new burger was out in less than 5 min. Looked as good as the one before. I mayo'd it up and bit in. Soooo much better! Still tasted the salty flavor from the grill, which was ok enough for me.   The staff did a great job. The burger was great-without the added salt, and I think it was a delicious and unique take on the potato chip burger.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay was never my favorite celebri-chef, though I always respected how good a loser he was on Throwdown and the not-good Iron Chef (aka Iron Chef America). You may laugh, but on Throwdown he was not only going up against people who were the best at what they do, he was always playing \"away games\" on THEIR turf - he had his work cut out for him and did a respectable job considering, and was never a sore loser or a dick to people. That said, I never liked him as much as Gordon Ramsay, who made his name out of being a dick to people.  But Gordon spoiled my illusion of his mad chef cred with his shite burger joint at the PH. Despite being a fast casual rather than a gourmet sit-down restaurant, Bobby's place blows BURGR out of the water. After the fiasco that was BURGR we almost didn't come here, but I'm glad we took the chance as it was right outside our hotel (the venerable Mandarin Oriental -- racist name, plush hotel).  The LA burger was decent - it was no Lucky Devil's American Kobe burger with crack sauce and crack bun, but it blew away the Gordon Burg(e)r o' Shame, and was cheaper to boot. It was a bit messy because it did not skimp on avocado. I ordered it rare and it was actually served rare! (This should not be that hard to find but sadly most places can't cook a rare burger, even if they say that they do. I'm not going to sue you, so unclench. Srsly.) They even offered to cut the burger in half for us to share, and gave us the potato chips on the side.  Cons: the burger was a bit on the small side, the bun was kind of McDonald-y, and the tomato was the sad pale bullet-proof kind.  I wasn't a fan of any of the sauces, but it didn't matter because neither the burger nor the fries needed it. The regular fries were surprisingly good, and I was pleasantly surprised that the sweet potato fries were not \"enhanced\" with extra sweetener like powdered sugar.  The dark chocolate milk shake was surprisingly not too sweet. The whipped cream was fresh, though a tad too sweet, but was perhaps a good balance with the dark chocolate, less sweet than regular chocolate by nature.  3.5 stars for food (A-OK+), 5 stars for service.  It was weird that you could only see partially into the kitchen - I spent the whole time watching a bunch of burly chests go back and forth... Not that this was necessarily a bad thing, mind you! One of the chefs complimented my husband's Unabomber beard - of course this from a man with his very own spectacular mountain man face muff.  I feel like the logo may purposely evoke the classic Burger Time video game. I also feel it maybe should have just been called Bobby's Burgers and had pun-ny names for the different burgers like the cartoon -- \"The Bobby Flayed Alive Burger: comes with pork cracklins.\" :D  I didn't see any of the problems with service or cleanliness other Yelpers mentioned. Surprisingly no tip line on the check, even though there was partial table service (just not full service). Too bad, I was so impressed I wanted to tip them 50%, especially after the horrible service at the full service BURGR.",

We asked Enzo the manager what burgers to get, and he said we should try the Louisiana burger = super yummy & tasty! I don't usually write yelp reviews but I just had the best time here. The place is big and cozy. Enzo was so kind and very helpful to us we really appreciated it and needed that since we've had such a crappy service experience by the other restaurant that we went to. And Mary in the cashier is very accommodating as well. Will definitely go back!",

The sesame bun is so fresh and just right amount of softness. How can anything not good with a running egg yolk and tender edge burned egg white on top of crispy bacon.  The self service restaurant is neat simple yet stylish. Also a good place to do people watching too.  The last but not the least, their burger sauce is a bomb.",

You can add potato chips in it for free which I definitely did. It was seriously soooooo good. I wish I had one of those bad boys right now. Try this burger you won't regret it!   It was about $10 for just the burger which we said was \"great for vegas\" you just used to a little bit higher of prices once you're in sin city. I remember the decor was really fun and funky. I would come back next time I'm in town, and get one of those alcohol milkshakes!   Vegas baby!",

I chose the blue cheese burger, and my friend had the LA. It took us around 20 minutes to get our medium rare burgers. The fries were good, as well as our milkshakes. We were ready for our tab but we couldn't find our bartender. So my friend went out to smoke and was so pissed to find out that our bartender was outside smoking with someone who appeared to be the manager. LIKE REALLY?!!! I felt like our time was wasted. She came back smelling like cigarettes and gave us our tab. We were very disappointed. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!",

A \"Numbered\" stand is provided after you placed order then you proceed to find your own table & place the \"Numbered\" stand on your table so that a staff will bring your food when it is ready.  The LA burger tastes blend; I have to add chipotle ketchup; bottom part of the bun is flat & soggy.  But the meat patty itself is perfect - medium rare - crispy outside - nice & juicy inside.  Use brioche buns would be much better.  The burger of the month - Cheyenne burger is very good but the bottom part of the buns is flat & soggy as well.  The Super Kale salad is okay but a bit on the salty side.  Blackberry & Pomegranate and Blueberry & Chocolate shakes are way too sweet for our palate.  The worst thing is a trip to its restroom - 11:45AM - multiple stains on the stainless steel trash bin;  no toilet paper holders but 2 rolls of wrapped toilet papers in its place instead.  A half used toilet paper roll sits on top of the toilet water tank!!  The floor is extremely sticky, it almost feels like your shoe bottom is glued to the floor inside the first stall!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "My brother and  I had spent a few hours hanging out on The Las Vegas Strip when we decided to have dinner. I like trying new places and decided to try Bobby's Burger Palace. I was impressed with Shake Shack and figured that Bobby's Burger Palace was worth trying.     Bobby's Burger Palace is in the modern day Kingdom called City Center. It sits at the Corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Aria Drive in the shadow of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.     On the Saturday evening that we visited Bobby's Burger Palace was not too busy. We walked right to the counter where you order in the left side of the building. I decided on the beef Philadelphia burger ($9.50), onion rings ($4), and fountain Coke beverage ($2). After paying, the nice lady at the counter handed us a number that we'd place on the table.     Bobby's Burger Palace is a relatively large restaurant with counter and Dutch style seating (large tables). The south facing views overlook the open kitchen where you get to see the action going on in the kitchen. The east facing views overlook the Las Vegas Strip with the Hawaiian Market Place. The close-up views overlook a burger and onion rings that I will talk about.   Beef Philadelphia burger: 3 stars      I expected a burger that brought my taste buds to the similar sensation of a Philadelphia cheesesteak. The major ingredients were beef, onions, provolone cheese, and hot peppers. It is my understanding that there is a celebrity Chef named Bobby Flay that is the architect of the burgers here. My taste buds are indifferent to celebrity chefs. Regardless that the burger was made from quality ingredients, in my opinion it was good and not great. There just wasn't much flavor to it. The hot pepper was the overwhelming taste of the burger. From my experience eating on this part of the Strip, I have had tastier burgers at Nathan's in NY-NY, Outback's, and Shake Shack.   Onion rings: 3 stars      The onion rings were giant size. Looking at them was impressive. Eating them was a different story. Because they were so big, it was annoying eating it. I'd bite the onion part causing the batter to separate. I've had better onion rings.   Conclusion: 3 stars    Bobby's Burger Palace, in my opinion is good yet nothing spectacular. When I pay nearly $20 for a burger, fries, and Coke I prefer a meal that is spectacular.",

    "text": "My family of four ate here twice during our five day stay in Las Vegas.  Gosh, the burgers are delicious.  We had a variety on our two visits.  The Dallas, the LA, the Miami, the American, the Carolina, and the Philadelphia.  I can vouch for the Dallas and the Carolina.  Burgers were cooked perfectly, were juicy and the toppings were just the right mix...crunchy, gooey, savory and sweet.  I had mine topless, e.g. served on a bed of greens tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  My teens also loved adding the potato chip \"crunch\" to their burgers.  Oh, and the frozen Mesa margarita is legit.  I never order frozen margaritas as they are usually bland and short on tequila.  However, given the near 100 degree heat, a frozen drink sounded spot on.  And it was.  The tequila was there, the lime was there, just the right amount sweetness was there.  On the second visit, my daughter got a black and white shake.  Decadent.  Fries were good too.  Big serving that we shared among the four of us.  Anyway, BBP was a cool, delicious oasis on a hot Vegas day.  Oh, and the service was exceptional.  From the front counter to the knowledgeable and friendly folks who brought out our orders.",

The burger was on the smaller side. Overall, this place is another place to take tourist money, and is not a good example of the quality food that you can get in Vegas.",

    "text": "Terrific burgers at a fairly reasonable price.   New Mexico version was particularly tasty.  Sounds like there are plenty of other burger joints on the strip but at heftier prices and perhaps longer waits in smoke filed casinos. Service was also good, friendly and efficient.  Eating area was funky and nicely designed.  Makes for great pics. Why settle for mediocre Wendy or McDonald burgers when you can upscale for a couple of bucks and have a great burger.   Yam fries were nice option also. A bit crispy on a couple of occasions but still quite a nice change from regular fries. Note to allergy sufferers:  the buns have eggs in them although the first two times they said it was egg free.  We were suspicious as our son had a mild reaction on the first two times that we were there but didn't put two and two together as we were \"assured\" of the egg free status.   On the third occasion, the manager actually caught this and let us know that it had eggs and omitted the bun.   On another allergy note, our son also has a dairy/ cheese allergy so when his regular burger came out with s bit of cheese contamination, the server quickly dealt with it and replaced the burger.",

We've been to Burgr, which was great until they burnt my burger and made me feel like i didn't know what a burnt burger was. So i'd consider BBP cheap for being on the strip and having the Bobby Flay name. I think the burgers are simple and smart. Some burgers try to be so much and miss the fact that it is a burger. I had the Vegas and the kick from the chiles were awesome! The shakes were delicious and our friends had the adult shakes. There was a major kick from those things unlike the ones they had at Burger Bar. you couldn't taste the liquor, but these ones were strong...and cheaper. I probably would've eaten another one.",

We placed our order and WOW, what a great place this was!!  From the girl who took our order, to the person cleaning the tables, to the person who brought our order, to the look and TASTE of the food - burgers, AMAZING - onion rings, AMAZING - Milkshakes, AMAZING!  I had to get up at the end and ask to speak to the manager, Lisa.  She came out and I just had to tell her what a well oiled machine she was running!  Everyone worked as a team and the food was superb!  I told her that it all starts at the top which meant she really cared about the product and the customer!  I'm thrilled that Bobby Flay wanted to give something to Vegas that everyone can enjoy at a great value!  And Bobby should be proud that Lisa and her team are taking that value and giving it 5 star quality and service!! Thanks so much!",

I was celebrating my 21st birthday weekend here in Lovely Las Vegas and today(may17th) my girls and I decided we would try the award winning Bobby's Burger Palace. Worst fucking mistake! I am currently sitting with my head in the toilet instead of enjoying Calvin Harris at Hakkasan tonight (which was my last hoorah before returning back to arizona) I am currently dreading what tomorrow has in store for my stomach because I am boarding a plane promptly at 8am to head back home....I already suffer from altitude sickness and I'm praying to baby Jesus that this sickness goes away before I get on my plane. The burger itself was amazing and tasted really juicy, cheesy, and crunchy(it had a layer of chips on it), I am so disappointed that this was experience just a few hours after eating here . I would definitely consider it to be alcohol induced....but I haven't had any in well over 12 hours. Thank you Bobby for giving me food poisoning :( this never happens to me!",

I sat facing Las Vegas Blvd. and enjoyed the scenery. I realized I wanted to place a take out order while sitting there as I wanted my friend to try it too. One of the waitress/busser came by and I asked her if she could place the takeout order.

I think I'll be back for another go, it was much better than other burger places in Vegas I've tried.",

The patty was extremely dry, I asked for no pickles, they put five. I brought it back to exchange for something else, but they refused because they were \"busy,\" however there was no line.  Bottom line, I was very un-satisfied with my experience at this establishment and I hope they take this review into consideration.",

It does not taste like the one you get from the soda machines- it actually tasted like real lemonade.  along with ketchup, they had different types of sauces to try out. I didn't fancy any of them at the time so I stuck with ketchup.   If you have a craving for burgers, come here. It's way better than Ramsey's BURGR place and fairly more affordable as well.",

This is no high end burger \"restaurant\" like Burgr Ramsey's place at Planet Hollywood. This is a walk up take your order McDonald's style and go sit and your food will be brought to you kinda place. Well not exactly the same they actually ask you how you would like your burger cooked which is a touch of class.   Now the food! Okay, they have a pretty good menu here to appease most any burger lover. Bobby also added some awesome milkshake/malts which are always a great peering with burgers along with a Mesa grill addition with some knockout top shelf margaritas.  Overall skip the McDonald's and come have a try!",

I think there is almost too much going on in these burgers and the flavor profiles clash in some instances. The french fries were not very good at all so that's where they ultimately lost a star.

We ordered the onion rings 4.25, Dallas burger 9.5, Palace burger 9.5r and a soda.   The batter to onion ratio was good.  The onion rings were thickly cut with a fried chicken coating.  This might sound good but consider that chicken is bland and needs a flavorful coating.  A cooked onion is sweet and only needs a subtle flavor to complement it.  The fried chicken batter totally overwhelmed the onion.  The accompanying sauces were all too salty except for regular ketchup.  Onion rings typically go well with ranch. Consider it Chef Bobby.   The burgers were way to salty.  One was inedible.  I looked into the kitchen area to see what they were doing and saw them streaming salt from a shaker onto the flat top.   There was more salt coming down than what usually goes on a batch of fries.  Note that a batch of fries serves dozens.   Each burger only needs a pinch of salt.  I am very disappointed.",

I had the California burger, it was cooked medium, it was pinker them I usually eat but it tasted good so I didn't complain. The guacamole on it was very good. My husband had the New Mexico burger, he had it cooked medium well, there was no pink and that's  how he likes his burgers. He really enjoyed it. We both had he prickly pear margarita, it was okay. The alcohol level was good but it lacked any distinct flavor. Angel offered us a different flavor but we just kept what we had. We spent $42 for a good size tasty burger and a margarita which isn't bad here.",

    "text": "Ok, 2 part review... Part 1: had a burger and fries with a soda for lunch, total was just under $20. A little spendy, but pretty average for Vegas, maybe even on the cheap side for this town. The location and atmosphere were great, i sat at a bar style seat looking onto the strip, it was nice. The burger was great! I got the classic crunch style and the meat, bun, toppings were delicious and clearly high quality. One note, I've heard this place compared to In-and-Out or Shake Shack... Not a fair comparison... These burgers are more gourmet and better compared to Red Robin or Five Guys, and I think it was better than both of those. Part 2: we went back in the afternoon for refreshments and Nora was our bartender. She was awesome, just outstanding on every level! I got a Margarita for $10 the was strong, delicious, and all around wonderful. The wife got the Little Raspberry which was $12 and her favorite drink of the trip so far. Tip: go with a friend, sit at the bar, split a burger and fries, and get strong delicious drinks from Nora!",

    "text": "YUMMY BURGERS!  Visited this place on a saturday afternoon and there was a short line, overall not too packed.  Menu is very easy to maneuver, on the wall to your left are all the options. You can also view the menu online and order ahead online.  I ordered the Crunch Burger, Brunch Burger, and Fries. The total was about $26 which is pricey for just burgers and fries BUT the quality was superb.  Although it may be pricey the quality is higher than average and I think it is worth it for the price. Burgers come with half a pickle to munch on. Beef patty is thick and juicy. Definitely good quality beef. Sesame seed buns which I think would be better if toasted, but good.  Crunch burger was very good. I don't like too much veggies in my burger so I love how they had this option which is plain with meat, sauce, and potato chips.  Brunch burger had a fried egg which cooked well. Not super runny.   Fries were ok, too greasy for my liking. I feel like it depends on the batch as well because ours might have been the last of the batch that's why it might have been more oily and crunchy.  Overall very impressed with the quality of their beef. Juicy and yummy burgers forsure!!!",

The burgers were pretty good, but it wasn't worth the price and nothing exceptional. Also, why is putting potato chips in burgers a thing? It doesn't taste that good together. I prefer having them separate. Personally ruins the taste of the burger to me. The inside is very nice and has a great atmosphere, but there's better burger places else where in The Strip.",

I ordered a green chili cheeseburger and was convinced to add an egg.      My burger arrived with an over cooked egg, so I sent it back.  I counted 6 pieces of green chili, so I ordered more on the side.  After all that extra work, it was ehhh.       On the positive side, everyone was friendly, the gal didn't complain about getting me a burger that I paid for.  Place was clean, bright, airy.  But, none of us would return.  Too many better, cheaper options out there AND more bluntly, I feel like he is banking on his name rather than providing a quality eating experience. ---------------------- @ Brad W. was offended that I would suggest that there are cheaper options out there - In google type, \"hamburger places near 3750 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109\"   Hope that helps, dude.",

We were craving burgers after seeing the Knights game so we turned to Yelp and stumbled upon this place- glad we did! Bobby's Burger Palace is a quick 5 minute walk from the arena and I'd say one of the better options for a quick bite within the area. You order at the front, seat yourself, and your food is brought out to you; so more like a quick-service as opposed to full on restaurant style.  We ordered the Greek burger and \"The Bobby\" along with a side of sweet potato and garlic fries- all of which were delicious! Cooked perfectly to our medium rare requests and full of flavor- and the fries were crispy and well- seasoned. I wouldn't call the burgers \"gourmet\" but more like a high end In-N-Out with more options.   Great experience and our cravings were fulfilled! Oh and get the cookies & cream shake it's amazing!!",

So the good: Really good Onions rings! a lot of sauces for fries and burgers creative flavors and decent burger really friendly service overall and the place itself is unique pick any temperature for your burger The bad:  Expensive: For a fast casual boutique setup I think it is pretty steep to be spending over $20 for a Drink, fries and a burger. The bun is way too small for the burger size The burger itself is large but lacks flavor over than just beef.   would I come here again?

The place is very modern, great location right in front of Aria/Mandarin. Took a couple minutes to get our order in but it was ok. We had fries, onion rings, Palace Burger and a bacon cheeseburger, cant remember the name. Either way, the fries and onion rings were quite sad - the rings in particular were not breaded well and were not crispy. Batter kept falling off - very disappointing in flavor, texture and presentation. Same for the fries, just not crispy.  The burger patty seasoning was perfect, overall meaty flavor was 10/10. The bun was decent and the other burger fixins were ok. The milkshakes were excellent as well. Overall burgers and shakes - almost perfect. Everything else, kinda disappointing. 3.5/5 leaning more towards 4 stars because the burger was great.",

    "text": "Went there after a concert since we didn't have many options to choose from. The cashier was checked out, slow and not enthusiastic. My boyfriend and I got two Pacific Northwest burgers I got mine crunchified, fries and pistachio shake. I was quite ticked off by the quality of the bun, it reminded me of a McDonald's or Burger King bun, also, can't understand why he uses lays chips, it makes the burger super salty. I liked the sauces he had tho. Fries was ok, but the shake was underwhelming. I was expecting a lot more flavor the shake tasted nothing like pistachios and for a whooping 8 bucks, I'd rather get a nice dessert at Wolfgang puck for 8 dollars. Completely not worth it! If it tasted like an 8 dollar shake I wouldn't complain, but I was left underwhelmed.",

Super accommodating and a really friendly guy. Myself and my boyfriend didn't even sit at the bar, Caleb came up to us to see if we were satisfied and was extremely friendly. Honestly I thought he was the manager. Great eye contact and a humble guy. Will be back thanks to him!!",

I ordered the burger with blue cheese and a  side order of fries.  It took them about 10 minutes for my order to come out which was okay even though it looked like a slow day.  Presentation is okay but flavor was missing big time.  I took a bite of my burger and all the blue cheese spread fell out onto my plate and the bun broke in half.  Felt like nothing had seasoning or salt.  The French fries were super soggy as if they had been sitting for a while and those were missing seasoning big time not even my kids wanted to eat them.  An in and out burger would've hands down been a better option.  Probably won't try it again damage was $17 dollars.",

    "text": "The burgers here are great, but except for the ability to \"crunchify\" them (add potato chips) upon request, there's nothing really special that distinguishes them from the ones at other gourmet burger spots on the Strip.   The sauces for the fries and onion rings, however, are a completely different story. They're clearly the stars of the show here and definitely worth the trip. The sweet potato fries are served with a horseradish honey mustard while the regular fries come with a chipotle aioli spread. Each table also has bottles of jalapeno sauce and chipotle ketchup, both of which are highly recommended. It will set you back $4 for an average-size side of fries, but the cost is well worth it just to try these assorted sauces.  The other appealing aspect of Bobby's Burger Palace is the option for tourists to walk in directly off the Strip sidewalk. But if you're a Vegas local or a tourist with a car, I definitely suggest parking at the Mandarin Oriental valet (which is directly next door just a few feet away). You'll save yourself a long walk and the possibility of having a yardstick of beer spilled on you by a drunk and stumbling tourist.  In summary.... If money is no object, you don't mind a wait, and you're looking for the best-tasting burgers in town, there are other burger spots I would recommend more (especially if you're looking for more of a restaurant than a fast-casual place). But if you're looking for a quick bite to eat at fairly reasonable prices (compared to other gourmet burger restaurants), you could do a lot worse than Bobby's Burger Palace. I personally prefer it over I Love Burgers (Palazzo) and BLT (Mirage), which are a bit overrated in my opinion.",

    "text": "Overall, BBP offers extremely tasty food at a reasonable price. The wonderful food, ambiance, and wide variety of burgers leaves me wanting to come back.   Price - $9.50 for all burger styles and no extra cost for turkey burger or chicken breast and you can get the burger \"crunchified\" for no extra cost. The shakes are pricier at $6.50 and seemed slightly smaller than normal shake sizes. Sweet potato fries are $4, but feed two people. We got 2 burgers, 2 shakes, and 1 fry for $38, plus a small optional tip at the counter and table.   Food - BBP offers a wide variety of burger options. The two we tried (Carolina and the classic) were amazing. What was most notable was how ideally cooked they were. They allow you to select from rare to well done. The sesame buns held the burgers and toppings together making it very easy to eat without the loss of any toppings. The  shakes were some of the most flavorful we've had. It is apparent that BBP is using the $6.50 to invest in quality ingredients and not skimping on them. Our coconut shake and pistachio malt were achievements in subtlety and over the top flavor, respectively. You could chew the flakes of coconut...mmmm. The sweet potato fries served two people and came with horseradish based dipping sauces. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had flakes of mild salt coating them.   Ambiance - There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor dining area is large and very modern and funky. There is S-shaped counter-style seating that zig zags across one side of the room. You can see through a wide openings to where they are preparing the good. The vibe is casual, but is fun to look.   Service - The service was efficient and friendly. The person who took our order at the counter made sure to guide us through our order and offered complementary water cups. The food was brought to us quite quickly. For being informal, fast-service dining, the service was very attentive checking in on us and the food.  It's clear that the sincerity of this place goes far beyond slapping a celebrity chef's name on the shingle.",

I ordered the Philly burger \"crunchified\" (potato chips on top of the cheese) and it was excellent They ask how you would like your burger cooked which is really class. I went med-rare and I would suggest that to all. The table features several different condiment options including a burger sauce ( kind of steak sauce-ish,) a jalapeno pepper sauce, chipotle ketchup and of course the stock ketchup and mustard. Also ordered fries that were just OK but the sauce served with them that has a roasted peppers note was very tasty. All in all pretty good. It's certainly not fancy, not cheap for a burger (but free drink refills were nice) but if you are on vacation or just throwing away the commitment to excellence for one meal its worth the stop.",

The menu is themed by burgers representative of various cities in the U.S. I ordered the LA burger, which had a nice thick beef burger patty, avocado relish, watercress and tomato. The medium well burger was cooked properly and the toppings were abundant, particularly the avocado. The only real critique was the burger itself was under seasoned, which other reviewers have indicated. Something underestimated about the burger was the bread was in the right proportion (just enough to fit the ingredients, but not more). The accompany burger sauces were a pleasant surprise. The jalapeno sauce had a nice mix of heat and sweetness and the chiptole ketchup was a nice added kick from regular ketchup. The fries were crispy and salted well. Everything was fairly priced, particularly given the location. All and all a good experience and I'd eat here again.",

In case you were wondering, this is a type of place where you order at the counter and they bring the food out. The seats were fairly comfortable and it wasn't super crowded when I was there, but I bet it might be during peak lunch or dinner hours.   Very affordable (for the strip)! Expect to pay about $15-20 per person for a good size portion of food. If drinking is your thing, they have a bar!   4 well-deserved stars. I'd be back, but probably wouldn't drive to the strip just to eat at this place. But if I was meeting other out of town guests who were staying at the strip? Sure, why not. I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 stars because of the inconvenience of being on the strip. I took uber to make it easier given I live in the burbs.",

My friend and I had very high hopes for this establishment given the fact that Bobby Flay has a pretty solid reputation in the culinary world - so We figured a burger by flay is easy money. Right? WRONG!   Walked in to a very empty restaurant, with maybe 8-10 patrons at max, at about 1:30 pm. Ordered 'The Melt' burger, small fries, and a soft drink, equating to around 20 dollars. Although this seems very high and unreasonable, slapping the celebrity chefs name on it made it justifiable for my friend and I.   On to the burger. Ordered it medium, came out medium well to well, very dry, cheese was almost non existent, and a few pieces of caramelized onions. Didn't taste the dressing which was supposed to tie it all together :/ staff was nice and prompt, had it sent back and remade to a perfect medium however, it still wasn't enough to save the burger. The bun, sesame crusted, almost reminiscent of a toasted white wonder bread , did not hold up the toppings nor the meat. Complete utter disaster.   On to the fries. LOL. that's all I have to say. Hands down one of the worst French fries I've ever eaten in my entire existence. Oily, soggy, and a bunch of end pieces in a cup reminded me of pigeon droppings. It was served with some watered down chipotle sauce that dripped onto my friends Gucci shirt and basically ruined his entire day. No excuse To cut corners and save cost by watering down your sauce!! Wtf Bobby?!  Service was great, friendly. I'm not sure about the kitchen staff though. Will I return? Probably not. Unless Bobby himself sends me an apology for this disgrace of a meal.   Have a nice day.",

He's famous for his love of a good burger, and even more famous for his onion rings that went head-to-head against Bon Apetit and still won. Service is really good here.  The folks are helpful. And food comes out relatively fast considering these are higher-end burgers. I ordered the standard cheeseburger with bacon.  Crunchified comes free a la potato chips inside for texture.  It's an Angus patty with cheese, lettuce, tomato, raw onion, and housemade Thousand Island dressing.  The sesame seed bun is toasted.  It's a pretty solid burger.  My complaint was that it wasn't seasoned enough...I couldn't really taste the beef and mine was a tad overcooked. The onion rings are a delight.  They look thick-battered and heavy, but they are as light as a feather and not greasy at all.  The onions are super thick-sliced so you taste onion, and the batter is speckled with black pepper and seasoned well.  The housemade ranch dressing is also excellent.  I would come back for the onion rings. The shake of the month for June 2019 is blueberry cheesecake.  It was nice, but neither too blueberry or too cheesecake-y.  It comes with literally a dollop of fresh whipped cream.  Eh...it was okay. I would come back for those onion rings.  A short walk over from the Aria valet or Waldorf Astoria lobby.",

The past two times I've ordered the Philly Burger, once with a fried egg and once with bacon and \"crunchified\" (potato chips on the burger). The potato chips weren't my thing but it does seem to be popular.   This past week, we sat at the bar with bartender Caleb. Excellent service! He was super friendly, it was almost like hanging out with another friend. The second time we stopped by, he wasn't there so we did the self-service part of the restaurant. We still had good (and really fast!) service from everyone.   The burgers are good, not the best I've ever had but no complaints at all. The onion rings are great! Highly recommend those.",

    "text": "Mr Flay, not sure if you see this, but thank you for bringing your recipes and methods to the masses. This is easily the best burger of my life - I had the Mulberry Street burger, medium, with fries and soda. $20. Not bad for the Strip, and for a \"wow\" experience, I could eat here every day.  There is an obsession with perfection here. The meat is 85% black angus sirloin, always fresh. It had a dark sear from a super-hot griddle, flipped once. Cheese added, and then steamed and brought up to perfect medium. Wow. There's at least a 2mm char, and juicy but not greasy. I'm 50 - I grind my own hamburger. I have a 700 degree natural gas grill. I hope to duplicate the burger patty before I die.  The bun was..dang, how did they do that? Super-sesame seeded, soft and chewy, but perfectly (of course) toasted to hold up to the burger & condiments.  A great burger must have great fries. These are crisp, skin-on, not greasy at all, even salted perfectly. There's a chipotle mayo-based sauce, but go for absolute fry perfection and use the chipotle ketchup. That recipe is secret, but maybe there's fennel in there. Terrific.  You read this far- the secret sauce is the Jalapeno Hot Sauce. It's not that hot - below a Tabasco. But OMG. Some vinegar in there to compliment the fries, some sweet - what?  Tomatillos maybe?  Cuts the heat a little more. And it's pure Bobby Flay genius in a bottle. French fries the world over will never be the same. My only regret here? No room for a pistachio shake. But the manager brought me a taste :). Thank you all so much.",

Manager did apologize saying his fryer was still training after they already lied and said all of their people have been trained to cook like Bobby.

The chips bring a good crunch to it but it doesn't help with the overall saltiness - it was very very salty. The structure of the burger was extremely on point though, did not fell apart at all.   We were undecided on a side and the place had us covered with an 'undecided' which was a mix of french fries and onion rings. They came with a really good garlic mayo.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.   Will I come again? Doubt it, it wasn't a memorable burger but I still had an overall good experience.",

Onion rings were served five in an order, and the onions were undercooked and crunchy. No lettuce on the burger, and crunch burger had Lays or some other mass produced potato chip. Milkshake didn't come to the top of the cup and was light on ice cream.  Only reason the place didn't get one star was because the server who took our order and served us was so hospitable and warm.  One funny thing: there are photos of Bobby Flay everywhere, and a couple of quotes with sayings like \"the only celebrity here is the food.\" Lol. No. Food is weak, especially for Vegas. Hot In n out instead.   Bobby Flay is resting on his laurels, and his reputation is undeserved, or at least no longer relevant.",

You might want to cut the burger in half before attempting to eat it!  There are a lot of fun sauces on the table to try when you're dining in. Our favorite was the Jalapeno sauce. It's some fun tangy spicy that cuts any grease down. We definitely enjoyed the jumbo sized onion rings. Great crispy batter. Our order came with 5 rings and a side of ranch. It's not your normal ranch as it tasted a lot like sour cream. We also ordered the bacon and cheese scallion fries. Not recommended due to to the cheese sauce being extremely salty. Don't know what happened there. We couldn't finish our order of fries because of that.   Friendly service and staff. They make sure to keep the place clean.

I ordered a medium well Canadian Burger (White cheddar cheese and Canadian bacon) with the maple mustard on the side. It's the burger of the month and worth trying.   The structure of the restaurant is a bit different in a good way. You have to pay before you're \"seated\"; you seat yourself and then your food is brought to you. There aren't any booths but multiple semicircle shaped tables that a party can sit on either side of. It's a cute alternative for larger parties. There's still more intimate seating for couples and those dining alone.  Get there earlier in the day if you want to beat the chaos of The Strip. Definitely stop by if you're staying at the Waldorf; it's too close NOT to.",

    "text": "We had a late night at a concert, and didn't get back to the Strip until after 10pm on a Wednesday, which limited our fine dining options.  So instead of fine dining, how about burgers? At least, you know, FAMOUS BURGERS?   I like Bobby Flay. He does some good TV. He is a good chef. And I went to his place thinking it would be reflective of his unyielding ethos. Alas, it was not.  It wasn't ... terrible. We ordered three burgers (one green Chile, one palace classic, and one L.A. Burger ... fit style ... and as an aside to the person in our party who ordered the L.A. Burger fit style, you're not fooling anyone. It's still a burger with cheese, not kale and roughage). We also had a side of sweet potato fries and a shake (flavor of the month, mudpie).  The shake was the highlight, and we all tried it. Definitely quality shakes! The sweet potato fries were fine. No problems, but also not particularly memorable. Solid.  Now, the burgers. Okay, the \"fit style\" burger (served on greens instead of in a bun) didn't have the cheese melted and wasn't cooked to the specified temperature. The green Chile burger was okay, but I'd just had much better in New Mexico. The classic burger was good, but had been ordered medium and came out medium rare (barely medium rare).  Basic quality control issues that can be cleared up. Service was ... well, the individual who brought out our shake appeared to go on break right after that, leaving our food on the counter, sitting there. Luckily, the incredibly nice and efficient server who took orders in the front swung around, saw the situation, and brought us our food. You just need to someone to go that extra mile.  Bottom line- all things being equal, I'd rather have Shake Shack. If Bobby Flay was judging his own food coming out of this place 0n this night, I think he would be a lot more critical than I am right now.",

We were served a few different  sauces to add to our burgers.  My favorite was  the BBQ sauce, and I really loved the chips inside.  The fries and onion rings we're good, too.

    "text": "Oh Bobby's Burger Palace...I've been dreaming of you since January, when I came out for a tasting with Yelp, and I finally was able to make it out this weekend, to try you out for real.  No Yelp banners guaranteeing great service...the wonderful anonymity of being just a regular patron.  I had been raving about Bobby's since January.   The tasting that I attended with Yelp (my first EVER Yelp event) was so wonderful, I kept looking for excuses to drive down to the strip to try the burgers again!   I love going to events, but I always wait to review a place until I've been back as a regular paying customer.  That way I can review the food and service without any bias.  So, oddly enough, after another event on Saturday night, my fella and I met up with a friend in town for dinner at Bobby's.    We perused the menu, and decided on our burgers, beverages, and fries.  The girl who took our order was sweet, and polite, and very friendly.  We sat down, and within a very short time, we had our drinks:  An IPA for my love, a Cactus Pear margarita for me (where have you been all my life?!) and a spiked milkshake for my friend. (it did not bring all the boys to the yard, however.)   The service was great, we were checked on frequently, but not too frequently that we were annoyed.  The margarita was strong, and just as amazing as I remembered.   The spiked milkshake, though...WOW.  We had the vanilla, caramel, bourbon shake, and it was heaven in a glass.  Those could be dangerous!!  The burgers came out, and they looked amazing.   Mine:  The New Mexico Burger: with Queso sauce, roasted green chilies, and pickled red onions:  I remembered this being one of my top two at the tasting, and this did NOT disappoint!  Spicy and delicious, with flavorful beef!  It was cooked perfectly.   BF: The Bobby Blue burger: blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I didn't try it, but judging by how quickly it was gone, I think he liked it. ;)   Friend: The Brunch burger: fried egg, smoked bacon, and american cheese.  I did try a bite of this one, and the egg was perfect and runny, with delicious crisp bacon!    We also did the half and half, with sweet potato fries and french fries.  Both were awesome.   The boys tried all of the sauces, and decided that the favorite was the Burger sauce.    For 3 people to have a burger each, split fries, and an alcoholic beverage, it only came to $62.  That is SO reasonable.  And now for the blasphemy:   I think I prefer Bobby's to Gordon Ramsay BurGR.   They were both great, but Bobby's just felt like a more authentic, tastier American burger, and for half the price.    I can't wait to come back again.",

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Philly burgers - provolone, griddled onions, and hot peppers ($9.50) crunchified (which means with potato chips). We also ordered fries ($4).  II. The burgers We actually asked for double crunchified and it was awesome! It seemed gimmicky at first, but everyone really enjoyed the potato chips. The burger patty was cooked perfectly to order, but they were a little on the dry side. There was a meaty flavor, but not matching some of the beautiful meatiness we've had in other burgers. The patties were seasoned heavily with black pepper, which gave it a great flavor. The peppers and onions were cooked well and despite the multitude of seeds in the peppers, they weren't overtly spicy. They gave a great little kick to the burger. The provolone seemed to fade into the background and seemed unnecessary on the burger. They didn't like the bun because it got soggy with all the juice from the onions and peppers, but I like that it has sesame seeds. They also give you a giant pickle spear! Yum!  III. The fries Fries are good, pretty standard. They were cut a little thicker, but not too potatoey.  IV. Miscellaneous This is located in the city center area. If you're getting dropped off by uber or lyft, get dropped off at the Mandarin Oriental entrance. It's really close to Bobby's. They have a bathroom code that you need (printed on your receipt). They have bottled and tap beer. They have some cool looking lights in the restaurant and the tables are shaped interestingly. A waiter comes by and gives you utensils and stuff, but you order at the counter before you get seated. They also have \"to go\" if you wish. The waiter told us they make 25 homemade sauces, but they only have 3 of them out for your dipping/topping pleasure. The woman who took our order, Valerie, was hilariously funny. She was great; the self proclaimed bathroom nazi.  V. Value Value is pretty good especially because you can crunchify your burger for free! You definitely need to crunchify your burger!  VI. The verdict The Philly is definitely not their best burger. I would recommend the Miami or the Dallas instead. However, these ratings are based on this particular burger: 3.1, 3.4, 3.7, 3.7, 3.8.  Next burger crew meeting: Gordon Ramsay Burgr after we get some drinks at Todd English PUB! Eat all the burgers!",

We valeted at Mandarin Oriental and had a short walk to the back door.  The restaurant was fairly empty at 5:15.  The only people in line were Clark County firefighters from the local house by Vdara.  I got a bleu burger and my wife got a Miami burger .  We each got an order of regular fries as iced tea.  My burger was done rare and my wife's medium.  My burger was very juicy--my wife's less so but that's what happens when you cook it too much-the way she wants it.  The fries were good and I could become addicted to the chipotle mayo served with them.    Service was quite good.  Different servers asked about iced tea refills and plates were removed in a timely manner so we could munch on our fries.  I wouldn't do this too often when I have a better choice near home, but when near CityCenter, the MO valet option makes this a place that will be on our list once in awhile.",

If he saw those fries made by any other Chef on his TV show he would fire them. Bobby I hope you will read this one day and correct this problem with the french fries after all they are an essential part to a burger. Just check out the pictures that I have taken and you'll see what I'm talking about. Another problem to go to the restaurant is parking you have to park at the Aria Hotel and walk all the way down the hill to get to the restaurant. Otherwise you can do valet parking at the Mandarin Hotel for 20 bucks! One thing I really liked is the interior design of the restaurant I thought it was funky.",

The sides were great on their own but what took this place over the top for me was the sauces on the table.  Bobby's burger sauce is amazing. The green pepper sauce adds a little heat to a burger or a twist in your ranch for your onion rings. The chipotle ketchup is amazing. After experimenting with flavors we found that the best companion to onion rings is ranch with burger sauce (seriously Bobby try it!)",

When we walked in the door, I wasn't even aware that this was Bobby Flay's place. Added bonus!  The burger menu was eclectic, with options ranging from \"comfort food\" to \"way out there\". I opted for the Crunchburger (American cheese, topped with potato chips), while my spouse chose the Carolina (smoked American cheese, green onion slaw, mustard BBQ sauce). We added a side of regular fries and split a pistachio milkshake.   The verdict? Delectable!   I could have eaten two of the burgers - they were hot, juicy and delicious. I half-expected the potato chips to be something exotic or fancy (like a kettle chip), but I'd swear that they used classic Lay's Potato Chips. I was delighted by this, and it turned out to be (by far) the cheapest meal we had during a long Vegas weekend.",

A bit overpriced for what we got but we love Bobby Flays recipes and make alot of his at home.

I expected to love this place....but I totally didnt.  The menu looks great. Wonderful variety, reasonable price point for Vegas Strip dining. You order up front and are given a number. There are no tables, booths or comfortable options for seating. It is all bar stool seating and only counter options. Basically you dine next to everyone else. I wouldn't care if I went to a bar and expected that, but not while having lunch with my husband. Luckily the place was almost empty, but it was a major bummer.   Forgive me for forgetting the names of the burgers we got, but basically they were super forgetable. Messy, onions way under grilled, cold bun, chunky lettuce that was more rib then greens and thin meat patty. Even adding sauce did not improve the lack of flavor. My husband said his was 'okay', but mine was plain awful.  Onion rings were fine. Nothing interesting to report. The bacon cheese fries were super delicious. Fresh fries, crispy bacon and super melty cheese. A perfect side. The shake we ordered, black and white, was fine.  I would not ever go back. There are many other burger places within walking distance to this place that I would choose 10X over. Sorry Bobby, but we still love you.",

    "text": "My friend loves burgers so we ended up trying this place. Let me begin by mentioning what this place got right: location (City Center) and meat options (beef, turkey, or chicken breast). Considering these things, this place is inexpensive at $9.50 for a burger or $8.50 for the Crunchburger (double American cheese/ potato chips) + it's free to get it \"crunchified\" (BBQ potato chips in your burger); $4 for sides or $5 for half onions rings, half fries; $6.50 for shakes; $9 for spiked shakes. They also have salads and sandwiches.  Brunch Burger: Bacon, fried egg, and American cheese. This was just alright. Plain, ordinary, nothing exciting. 3/5  Vegas Burger: I got this with turkey and crunchified. 3.5/5  Beer-Battered Onion Rings: The rings were huge and quite heavy. They're tasty and golden brown. 4/5  French Fries: Real potatoes probably fried twice. They have a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Nothing new/ exciting either. 2.5/5  Dark Chocolate Shake:  This shake didn't taste like dark chocolate at all - regular chocolate is more like it. 2/5  Black and White Shake:  Chocolate syrup blended with vanilla ice cream. This is an old recipe and you just can't go wrong with this. 4/5  The shakes were of the right consistency - not runny, not too thick. You have no options to be creative and add toppings/ fix ins with them though. The service was alright. The place is bright, modern and clean. It just doesn't have anything worth coming here over and over.",

I just ate the batter. My friend ordered a salad.... And it was the saddest salad we had ever seen, they even served the butt of the lettuce. It was way too pricey for what we got.  I'm sorry bobby, but whoever is running the kitchen is not living up to your expectations.",

    "text": "If you step in this palace, please get the Cheyenne Burger. It's a monthly special so hurry up. Let me talk about this burger, it contains a patty, a patty to rival all patties you have ever dared to taste. The medium patty is juicy, pink like a freshly born baby, and tastes crisp, as if you bit into the old spice commercial guys arm. On top of that patty lies two strips of bacon in an X formation. This bacon has been breaded in something mystical, to create a cohesive taste experience that you have never before felt. Then resting on top of that bacon is onion strips that sting your mouth like a biting Python. Then drizzled on top of that beauty is a barbecue sauce. This is a slightly above average barbecue sauce but when you add the burger sauce on it, it turns into a sauce that makes you smile with glee as it coats the inside of your mouth. When you bite into this burger all these elements blend together and your eyes start to tear up in shocking happiness, you have found the burger of your dreams. You have found euphoria at last.",

Although i was trying to remain somewhat on my diet but kinda splurge at the same time so I ordered the turkey burger, didn't like it. I felt that it was tasteless. The bun and the toppings were good but the meat its self didn't do anything for me. I've had better turkey burgers.  What did make me happy though and some what made up for this was the sweet potato fries! Very soft on the inside and crunchy on the out! Perfect!  They also have a few different sauces!   The presentation of the burger was nice came out very well put together and looked appealing.   My bf got an actually beef burger with jalapenos and and cheese and the whole works and it looked absolutely great, he like it very much and had no complaints.  The prices could be a little lower for sure.",

Not because the salad wasn't great, but I wished I had the whole burger experience! The patty was freakin' delicious! It was moist and tender and very flavourful.

    "text": "Honestly I wanted to try a good burger and with two celebrity chefs restaurants in the vicinity I decided on Bobby flays brunch burger . I was not disappointed. It is quite possibly the best burger I have ever had at a restaurant . Beef was cooked perfectly medium , pink almost red in middle but not so red that it bloodied  the bun to sogginess  , cheese melted perfectly but not melted to the point that the cheese was all thinned out .  It was tied with an egg and bacon which followed suit with the egg just running enough to add the flavor to the burger like a sauce  The best addition was what they called crunchified  Meaning chips on top Highly recommend",

I wasn't sure if it would be good but I will try someplace new at least twice.  I feel like when a restaurant becomes a chain the quality is not good. Well we were very surprised the food was excellent as well as service.  Even though it was a bit pricey we will definitly be going back.  I had the Mexico burger with onion rings.  They were amazing.  The milkshakes are thick and creamy.  The sauces on the tables were so good.  I especially loved the jalapeno sauce.  Great place Bobby Flay, kudos for making sure everything was fresh and I'm sure as good as if you were there making it.  So if you're in Vegas make to stop by Bobby Flay Burgers",

    "text": "The food is delicious as one would expect from a restaurant named after Bobby Flay. I expected superior service also but after 2 visits that has not been the case on either one. In fact it has been just so so both times.   The ordering process here is simply way too slow and needs to either be redesigned or a manager needs to step up and hire and train enough people to handle the volume of business that comes with the name. My guess is that there is some type of licensing arrangement because I can't imagine Bobby Flay being a part of anything so off the mark.  Today, on a Saturday afternoon, they were out of Coke at the self serve fountain machine. That of itself shows poor management. When I pointed out the problem to a bartender after pouring and drinking the distasteful remains of the coke she told me they were out of Coke. And then did nothing to let customers know about the lack of this core beverage either at the fountain machine or the ordering counter. This clearly demonstrates a lack of interest in the guest's dining experience. I might expect this at a fast food burger joint but not at a high end palace like this.  To be clear and fair, every employee was polite and friendly. The crunchburger and fries were so superb that I will no doubt be back to give it another try. It just feels like this is a ship without a captain bobbing around aimlessly, not a burger palace operated by a world renowned chef like Bobby Flay.  UPDATE: I came back for the crunchburger and fries and was not disappointed as both were superb. The service was the same as on previous visits. They do have some nice workers and some of them seem to care. But it takes way to long to place and pay for an order, ridiculously slow process that could be fixed overnight.  Today I saw something that I still have trouble believing or understanding. While I ate my meal the bartender also ate a meal, while on duty behind the bar, in plain site if everyone. This is very unprofessional and probably prohibited by health department regulations, plus just a little bit disgusting. Oh well, things like this don't seem to matter to the management of this establishment.",

    "text": "First time here so here we go...  I ordered the New Mexico crunchified with half sweet potato and onion rings. I also ordered a Bud Light to wash it all down.   The burger looked great when it arrived. I couldn't wait to dive In. However, the bun bottom was soggy and I couldn't pick it up easily.  Then I noticed the cheese melted over the bun,which further made it an issue. At this point, I would use a fork and knife, but they didn't have that. So after I had a firm grip, I took my first bite. Immediately the heat from the green chiles was noticeable. Very tasty indeed with a kick. It did have pickled onions and I really wasn't feeling that. It actually detracted from the flavor of the green chiles and everything else in the burger.   With my half and half (sweet potato/onion rings)  I received two onion rings and the rest sweet potato fries.  It came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. The sauce was good for the fries, but not the onion rings. The second issue is no ranch for the rings. I get Bobby wants a sauce with flare, so why not chipotle ranch or jalapeno ranch.  You can't have onion rings without ranch. I even tried the chipotle ketchup, jalapeno sauce and BBQ sauce, but nothing did it for the rings.   I was 3/4 into the burger and loving it. The last and final issue arose. Because the bottom bun was soggy, the burger just fell apart. So I ate just the patty and called it quits. I left the soggy bun behind because I wasn't going to eat greasy bread.   All in all, the food is in the same category as Smashburger, Five Guys, Habit, In N Out.   I'm not sure if that's what Bobby intended, but that's reality. So with that, I can say I've been there, done that.  Moving on...",

    "text": "BBP is a more fast food style place than other strip gourmet burger stops. Its about 1/2 the price of Burgr or Holsteins, and I would say better than 1/2 the quality. Could it be better-yes. Is it a good value for the price- yes.   The real standout item here for me was the shake. I got the black and white and just picking up the glass and feeling the weight I could tell it was going to be a truly thick shake- not a thing, soupy glass of nonsense. It is 6.50 for a shake- if Quentin Tarantino saw that he may roll over in his coke binge. But its a REALLY good shake.   The burgers had very high quality meat. They appear to use that technique where they grind the meat and keep the grains for making the burgers so they are fall apart in your mouth tender. I got the Las Vegas and it was pretty spicy and very flavorful. I will say the bun was a bit of a let down- seemed pretty cheap/and was totally bland. The burger was not served searing hot which I would of preferred- nothing tastes better than 3rd degree burns- but it certainly wasn't cold.  The fries/Onion rings- we got the 1/2 and 1/2- the onion rings were very good. The fries weren't very crispy so I would take off points for that. The fry sauce and chipotle ketchup are both delicious.  Frozen Cactus Pear Margarita- yes please.   Overall, this place isn't Mesa Grill- you can kill yourself with food for 20 dollars and you get a quality meal for that money. If price is no option and you have time to wait I would say go to Burgr, otherwise BBP is prob the 2nd best cheap strip burger behind, ironically, Strip Burger IMO",

This place is doing it right. I mean its bobby flay's place for crying out loud. I regret not taking pictures.   We had some drinks in the hotel so by the time we made it to dinner we felt pretty good. Between all of us we ordered a different burger so that we can each try something different. I ordered the blue cheese burger, which I love to begin with. I was really satisfied and they have a full bar. The hours were pretty great and the location is right on the strip so its hard to miss this place. Great job staff and team, keep it up.   Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to come back here again. I enjoyed it.",

    "text": "There is no other street in America like Las Vegas Blvd. \"The Strip,\" that I can think of that contains some of the most popular burger chains in America. The variety of selection in the past few years has exploded on the strip. This includes huge outpost for In-N-Out, Shake Shack and White Castle. Plus celebrity chefs with their take on burgers prepared their way. So I was really looking forward to trying Bobby Flay Burger Palace.   The atmosphere is very modern and good for large groups. Pretty much order at the counter and get served at your table. I was quite pleased with the service considering there was a line but the staff was helpful and the whole process of ordering and receiving was great. At the time of my visit, the dinning room was organized and clean.   Onto the the food, I ordered the Brunch Burger (Fried Egg, Smoked Bacon & American Cheddar) with an order of half & half (Fries & Onion Rings). The burger was ok and wasn't that mind blowing. I personally didn't like the seasoning of the the meat patty and was on the oily side. My order of fries was on the soggy side and could've use more seasoning but I did enjoy the onion rings. A cool thing about this place is the condiment caddy and the various sauces at each table.   Would I come back, it depends if I'm in the immediate area with family or friends who wants to check this place, other than that it's not something I would come back for. However, it's worth checking out and maybe catch a glimpse of Bobby Flay!  2017 Yelp Review #22",

It was not the best burger I've had but it was easily #2-5.  He Bacon Cheese Fries we're also delicious but the cheese was bordering on the edge of nacho cheese. It was super melted and warm all throughout but I was expecting something a little different I guess.  The bathrooms. You need a code to get in. Don't forget it when you decide to go. Also, it was a terrible state inside. It's almost as if the employees were locked out and unable to clean it.",

During my last trip to Vegas I also got the HK burger at Fleur (which if I remember correctly was close to $50) and I'd pick Flay all day!  All the burger options are great and they also have a new burger of the month which is not a regular menu item. If I were forced to pick a favorite, I would recommend the LA burger.  You can order your level of doneness. I go medium rare and my wife gets rare. They've always come out just right.  You can also get any burger on top of greens instead of a bun which my wife appreciates.  Fries are great and come with a very nice fry sauce. The lemonade is also great and you get free refills.  I always go a couple of times when I'm in Vegas. My only regret is I never have room for a shake.",

I loved how the chips went well inside the burger and the meat patty was definitely high quality beef!   The sweet potatoes fries were pretty delicious as well! I highly recommend to order them crispy! The onion rings were super good as well with a nice crispy dough batter fried to perfection around each onion ring. The downside of the onion rings is that you only get 5-6 of them, but they are decently sized and delicious.  This burger joint is perfect for those refueling on the Vegas strip. I highly recommend this establishment. There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "Liked everything about this place!  Food, execution, ambiance and location!  First it's very easy to find on the strip next to the Aria hotel. (Best hotel ever)  You can order online if you're in a rush, there always seems to be open seats due to the unique seating layout. And the food, hey, it's Bobby Flay's joint.  No need to even ask if he's using quality ingredients.  What was kind of a surprise was how well executed the rest of the restaurant concept was.  First, every customer is greeted by a friendly energetic face.  Options are well explained and after you order you're given a number to place on the table and when your food is ready it's brought out to you.  So, lots of places do this, but Bobby takes it a step further.  You can view the open kitchen which is always a good sign of a quality restaurant.  Another cool perk was that every order that comes out of the kitchen and placed on the oversized service window ledge can be viewed easily.  Cool way to see what others are getting, gave me ideas for next time actually. To my surprise almost everyone is getting chips on their burger, not just me!  Thought I was being a little daring but in Bob we trust.  Bobby says chips go on burgers then only thing I could say is hook me up with a crunch burger now!  The hamburger was delicious and quite unique.  More specifically it resembled a steak in flavor more than just a regular a burger.  First you have to squish down that top bun then open wide and ...to borrow a colloquialism from Emiril...BAM!!  You just had a bite of best burger in Vegas!!  Fries were excellent too and the food is made fresh to order which takes a few more minutes than the Ronald McMoney scene but it's worth every second and remember ...you can always order ahead!  Looking good Bobby!  5 well earned stars!",

The burger however was freaking dynamite. I had the Santa Fe and it was a mouth party. The queso sauce on there was delicious, and I paired it with the jalapeno green sauce and the burger sauce for a nice kick in the mouth. The green hatch chiles were a delicious addition, but most importantly the meat itself was a real treat. Well cooked with a nice crisp on the outside, and perfectly juicy inside. The sauce that came with the fries was amaze-balls as well.",

First off, the place is nice and clean. Servers are extremely nice and welcoming. The vibe is great! As for the food, it is definitely exceptional. The medium rare patty is a perfect mixture of juice and warmth. Complimenting that softness is the taste of what looks like unsalted lays chips. So far I've tried the LA burger, baconcrunch and brunch. Hands down brunch with overeasy eggs and crunchified is the best. Only complaint on the brunch is the egg is inconsistent. Sometimes the egg is big and runny, whereas sometimes the egg is tiny and negligible. Their sides are also note worthy. Fries are always crispy and the sweet potato fries are a bit salty (but i'm a fan of that). The onion rings are alright, really crunchy but they lack that flavor of onion. It tastes mostly like batter. Drinks of course are a solid! They have shakes and a bar.   The total for two burgers, half and half sides and one drink will most likely set you back 35$. Definitely a steal in this oasis of food. If you haven't tried it give it a shot!",

    "text": "For some reason or another, we had never made it onto the Strip to try Bobby's Burger Palace until a Monday late in the evening after we arrived at the airport from a trip. My burger was delicious and the overall first impression was good enough where this location will always be considered when looking for a burger when we're on the Strip.  Once you find the restaurant just in front of the Mandarin Oriental on Las Vegas Blvd, you can order from the counter, take a number, and the food will be brought out to you. Your choice of proteins for your sandwich are Angus beef, ground turkey, or a whole chicken breast, which you can choose to crunchify. And your choice of sides are sweet potato fries, hand-cut fries, and buttermilk onion rings. If you're not in the mood for a burger, they have a griddled cheese or salad as an option. For drinks, there is a soda fountain with Coke products. They also have shakes and a small selection of beer and wine.  After we ordered, we sat on the rail close to the bar where we could still view the televisions and our food was brought out in exactly 10 minutes. Other than the rail where we were sitting, seating is at longer straight or horseshoe shaped community tables. The temperatures of the burgers are cooked to order and my wife's Palace Classic with bacon was cooked well done to her liking and was finished without a problem along with our side, The Undecided, which we chose regular fries and onion rings. There's nothing significant to say about the sides, but that's not what I was there for. My New Mexico had a nice, juicy Angus beef patty sandwiched between a lightly toasted sesame seed bun and was topped with queso sauce, roasted green chiles that provided a little smoky heat, and pickled red onion that added some acidity and crunch.  We were pleased with just about everything except my Modelo definitely had some skunkiness to it (the college frat boy in me drank the beer anyway) and someone started cleaning the rail next to us after the previous customers, but didn't finish the job, which was kind of an eye sore but none of these things are major deterrents and wouldn't keep us from coming back. Total damage for two burgers, a side, and a beer was $38.",

The establishment was not that busy bit when I went to sit down the table was slightly dirty but it wasn't a make or break. The break came when I ordered the lemonade and say the simply lemonade bottle on the counter as it made it's way to me. The second disappointment was when my dad ordered a strawberry shake and barely had any whip cream on top. I ordered a turkey crunchburger and the Turkey itself was very flavorful and juicy but it definitely needed some veggies on top b/c a burger with just chips, cheese and meat was not as appetizing as it sounded. All in all I was disappointed that someone of Bobby's food stature would run such rinky dink situation. For the price it's not worth it.",

The reason for my lower rating for the food is I do not care for black pepper. This burger has quite a lot of black pepper. If you do this would be a five star burger. The fries and onion rings are good.  The shakes are thick and rich and creamy. Delicious! I have tried to multiple flavors and they are exceptional.  I would not call this fast food, but we have always gotten our food in 5-10 minutes.   If you are a burger person you don't want to miss this place.",

Even though I ordered before all my friends, my order didn't arrive for about 20 minutes. Friends were all but done with their food and I still hadn't received mine. When the employee eventually came out with only a burger she asked if I ordered fries and I said yes. She explained that the cashier rang up the order incorrectly so I would have to go back up to the counter and place another order for my fries. I declined because I had already waited 20+ minutes for my food and everyone else in my group was almost finished. It made me pretty upset because I had given them a tip as well.  The burger was good but I'll find a different burger place next time",

    "text": "This was on the top of my list of places to eat when in Vegas and Bobby Flay's Burger did not disappoint. A legit burger in all aspects.   I've been a fan of Bobby Flay ever since I saw him on Iron Chef Japan on the episode where he jumped up on the counter. I always liked his flavor profiles and his approach to preparation.   His Burger Palace is nice. Very clean and straight forward operation. Walk in, order at the counter, fill your own drinks, seat yourself and await your food.  They don't mess around with making you wait to be seated and taking your order at the table, etc.  I don't want to deal with all that overhead when I just want a burger. Bobby Flay's does it right.   I ordered the standard burger and it was perfect. The beef patty is 6oz and cooked medium by default. When they say medium they mean it. It was perfectly cooked medium.  The cheese was completely melted in accordance with Bobby's principal. The bun was simple and thin which is a great choice because it didn't take away from the burger itself. The lettuce, tomatoes, etc were perfectly portioned and warmed to not cool down the meat and cheese.  The burger came with no condiments but there was a wide range of condiments and sauces on the table .  That's perfect.  The flavor was perfect. It was probably the best burger I've ever had. It was the quintessential burger without being a clown job of layers upon layers of added crap. Just a great burger.  The fries were great too and I hear that the  shakes are fabulous.  I spoke to the general manager and she was so nice. She mentioned that Bobby himself comes in regularly and I just missed him.  Gosh, what a great place.",

You can add potato chips on top of any burger for free. The last time I went to the restaurant I tried the Cheyenne burger and the blackberry chocolate chip shake. Both were tasty! Service is fast and staff is friendly. Order, take a seat, and wait for your food to arrive.   Onion rings are extra crispy and come with a thick batter coating. I never liked onion rings until I tried them here and now it is my go-to side order at this location!   Parking: I park in the Aria parking lot (free for less than 60 minutes or $15 between one to four hours) and walk to the restaurant.",

I used to eat at the one inside of the Mohegan Sun Casino while I lived in Connecticut and I was super excited to see this one in Las Vegas when I was super hungry late at night. I strolled in around 10PM on Saturday night and the place was pretty busy. This place offers a good array of burgers and other sandwiches along with some solid appetizers and pop. I couldn't help get the OG cheeseburger with potato chips on it and I split an order of the onion rings on the side. The cheeseburger itself was cooked to perfection and the chips made it that much more enjoyable with the extra crunch it added. The onion rings were good, but not my preferred kind. I enjoyed the unique breading on the outside but I didn't absolutely love it.   Bobby's Burger Palace gets a big thumbs up from me and it's definitely a place worth popping into if you don't feel like spending a fortune on food while enjoying the strip. Great food, solid staff, food environment.",

Have an unbiased opinion coming here and not have high expectations just because it's Bobby's restaurant, base it on YOUR experience and YOUR opinion on the burgers itself.   Okay, it's Vegas and I was hungover and wanted a juicy burger. I didn't want anything fast food and I didn't want anything high end. Saw this place a couple of times walking down the strip and the reviews look good on yelp. Came on Monday after EDC and it wasn't busy.   The restaurant is spacious with a cute little bar in the corner. Hm, the tables could use a little attention. The restaurant was practically empty but there was trash still left on the tables so it wasn't visually appealing.   Anyways, BURGERS. Ordered the Palace Classic and it was good and satisfying. The patty was juicy and not skimpy. IMO, I thought the burger was slightly salty. They have a few different kinds of sauces but unfortunately I wasn't a fan of any of them. Besides it being slightly salty, the burger had a nice char to it which brought out tons of flavors.   It's a nice simple spot to check out if you're on that side of the strip.",

    "text": "Second consecutive Vegas trip that included going to BBP, and even better than the first time. Had the Palace Classic Burger the first time and the Green Chile Cheeseburger the second time. Both at medium rare temperature. Both amazing!  Notice that the restaurant primary colors are of mustard, ketchup, and lettuce.  The cactus pear margarita is so, so good and uniquely, mildly sweet. Recommend with a salted rim. MAJOR TIP: even though fries and onion rings are available as The Undecided combo, get the Buttermilk Onion Rings - the batter is perfectly light with pepper seasoning.",

I love him, he's an Iron Chef, a Food Network OG and although I've never met him personally, he seems like he is good natured and would be a lot of fun to hang out or bbq with, lol.   Regrettably, his Burger Palace did not serve burgers that met my expectations , which breaks my heart to write. The burgers were cooked accordingly as requested (medium), but nothing proprietary or extraordinary that would set them apart from any other ordinary. However, it was reasonably priced and the venue was spacious with plenty of seating and modern decor.",

We ordered and was recognized by the waiter whom is very nice. But we sat down and maybe about 20 mins in we received our sweet potato fries but they were burnt like the last visit the young lady seen this and took it back as the new ones came out began to eat. After about 45 mins my wife notice there were burgers in the window that looked like ours but the server just kept moving them out the way...we told the young lady that recognized us and she noticed we did not have our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fburger.so&s=23f40196442807ac846f5a6581f8cbec128969dcaf6d0f4c1226ea88ffc90cbb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">burger.so</a> she went over to the screen notice the burgers were ours. Had them remake it but after an hour of waiting we left to get pizza...again i love this place but maybe i shouldnt go at night.",

Instead got a very good burger and a dining experience like going to Carl's Jr.  You order your food and then they bring some of it to you while forgetting some parts...like your drinks.  So actually Carl's Jr.  has better service since you get your drink when you pay.       The food was very good...burger was cooked perfectly and fries were good.  Ordered \"half and half\" - half fries half onion rings.  Only got 2 onion rings....does this mean each onion ring cost $1?  Since a full order is $4...     Service was not what I would have expected.  When food was brought out drinks weren't brought at same time...another trip had to be made.  Then it took 2 people to bring a cup of water after asking for it.  Soda machine available for refills but no iced tea at soda station...had to ask for that refill too.       If you just want good burgers then this place is pretty good....albeit a little pricey.  If you want a great dining experience where you feel like you matter as a customer...there's several places where you'll get better service.",

    "text": "So disappointed with this place. Arrived at 11:15 pm with my friends, cashier told us that they were closing in 15 min so only takeout orders were being placed. We check online since we had previously seen midnight and then a huge sign at the entrance said open 11am to midnight we told her and she just hesitated to answer the question and gave us the excuse that it's open till 12 on weekends. BULLSHIT. Went on yelp & saw the hours everyday 11am to midnight. We should of walked away and taken our money somewhere else but since we were there & really wanted to try this place out but never again. Fuck this place!   Burgers are bland also, not worth the $10. Rather go to fatburger across the st. at least their burgers taste good!",

    "text": "We are Bobby Flay fans so we stopped here for lunch on a Monday on our recent trip to Vegas. Sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender! He had recommendations, made sure we had what we needed, and we had some friendly conversation with him.  For drinks, my husband tried a local beer from Tenaya Creek, a brown ale. He enjoyed it, said it was very similar to a Newcastle. I had a cactus pear frozen margarita, which was wonderful and a fun bright pink color! They use a higher end silver tequila (Casamigos) and the drink isn't too overly sweet like many frozen margaritas can be. They have a lime flavor also, the bartender let us try a sample and it was great too, even less sweet.  The menu is made up of several burger styles (different toppings/sauces), then you choose beef, turkey, or chicken. You can also order any of the burgers \"topless\" style, which has the patty and all the toppings on top of a bed of mixed greens. They also have a few salads, some sides, and shakes on the menu.   We started with an order of onion rings. The order had just 6 rings, but they were BIG rings, about 1.5 inches wide. Served in a tall stack, with a side of garlic & celery infused ranch to dip. The breading was light and flavorful, perfectly crispy. Yum! My husband ordered a secret menu item the bartender recommended, a beef burger \"Bobby's style\" - green chilis, a few other toppings we can't remember, and crispy potato chips on top. The patty is a mix of filet mignon & chuck. He really enjoyed the burger! I decided to try the veggie burger topless style. The patty was made up of mushrooms, chickpeas, & quinoa - it had a unique, almost nutty flavor. The smoked american cheese on top had great flavor also that worked well. The bed of mixed greens was actually full of mixed greens (not just iceberg lettuce like some restaurants serve), which I appreciated. The downside of veggie burgers is that they don't always hold together well after you start eating them, so I liked that I could get this as a salad and eat it all mixed up with a fork. Less messy for me!  Overall had a great experience here. We talked about making a second visit but weren't able to squeeze it in before we left for home. Next time! Thanks for some top quality, delicious food Bobby!",

The meat was great...everything else was average. The meat was juicy and cooked to my delight (Medium). The cheese however wasn't what I anticipated. It was ultimately a super melted cheese that tasted like a sharp white cheddar rather than bleu cheese. It kinda killed the experience for me as I love bleu cheese. For my side I went with the undecided (sweet potato fries and onion rings). The onion rings were great. It had a very peppery batter, but wasn't overpowering. The sweet potato fries were phenomenal. I'm just now coming around to sweet potato fries and I must say that these were the best that I've tried. I give it four stars as I think that the burger wasn't very tasty though it did have potential. I think if I ate here again I'd do a classic to get a better means of comparison to other burgers I've eaten.",

Bobby's Burger Palace (Las Vegas) was far less than I had hoped for. It was my first visit, so I decided to try the \"burger of the month\"; The Canadian Burger. Unfortunately, it was the most disappointing burger I've had in a very long time. A mediocre, diminutive burger with an unremarkable meat shingle, garnished with a slice of cheese and a simple piece of Canadian bacon. At $10.95, it was certainly not worth the price and the taste was ... meh. I also tried the bacon-cheese fries; again, not a good experience. The fries were oily, and the \"cheese\" was, well, cheese sauce (think nacho cheese sauce). To crown the experience, the fries were sprinkled with bacon bits. Bacon bits that made me wonder if they were real bacon. I'm sorry Bobby, but you really need to up this game.",

Since I do not eat beef and pork I was happy to see a pretty diverse menu.  We ordered and took out seat. While waiting I checked out the decor. It is VERY nice and interesting. Splashes on warm colors, from the floor to the ceiling elements and light fixtures. The communal seating was a interesting shape but also very comfortable. The persons whom designed the space gets my vote! VERY NICE........!  The food came out pretty fast. The servers were all very helpful in explaining the sauces and the descriptions fit the individual sauce flavor profiles. We pretty much liked them all. The ones with a little kick were THAT!... But not palate killer! My wife got the beef burger of the month with cheddar. I got the turkey burger new Mexico style. My wife LOVED her burger. Even the temperature was correct!  My burger was RI-DIC-U-LOUS!!!!... From the first bite to the VERY LAST... WOW!... The queso sauce, green chiles and pickled onions were a great combination. WOW-WOW-WOW!...   Pricing wasn't too bad, I mean, come-on.... It's on the strip!.... Let me just say, my wife and I said we were going to make it a point to visit some of favorite chef restaurants on this trip!!!... This was a GREAT prelude for what was to come on the trip!.   Again........... WOW!. You tha man Bobby!  ~Gone...... -J.V.",

The decor is simple, and the restaurant is massive.  You'll have no problem finding a seat, even if it's busy.    I like the variety in burgers and sides that are offered.  You absolutely have to get a burger with chips.  Such a simple idea, I don't know why I never thought of it before.  That delicious crunch of a regular chip on a cheesy burger is perfection.  The onion rings are great.  They are huge slices of onion - easy to share with a friend.    Burgers and milkshakes go great together.  I'm didn't try a spiked one...just sounds weird to me to have a spiked milkshake, but they seem to be a hit.    I like the casual feel to this burger joint.  You order up front, take a seat and they bring the food to you.  The staff are friendly, and there are lots of them if you need anything.  They have a bit of outside seating, a long bar-like seating along the window which is good for people watching along the strip.    They also have a few items you can buy to take home (apparel, sauce, spices etc.)",

Instead I received an underseasoned, overcooked tiny burger patty with soggy bacon. What a combo. I expected the chips to be homemade, but they tasted like lays original. My husband ordered the new mexico chicken. While the toppings were flavorful, the chicken portion was also tiny and overcooked. I guess its probably hard to cook miniature food. We also ordered the onion rings and sweet potato fries combo. The onion rings were tasty, hence the 2 stars, but the fries were soggy and lacked salt. The sauce tray was also a miss. None were really special, so I just stuck to ketchup.   Pricing is what one would expect on the strip, but the value is lacking. This place epitomizes the worst of Vegas. All show, no go. I am sorry I got suckered into eating mediocre food just because a celebrity chef's name was attached to it.",

    "text": "Bobby's Burger Palace is delicious! I ordered the New Mexico burger with turkey, and my husband ordered the Dallas burger with beef. We decided to try the Undecided, and got a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. We sat down and the food came pretty quickly! The turkey patty was perfectly cooked, dry at all. I loved the chopped green chilies and pickled onions, so the New Mexico burger was a great choice. My husband loved his burger and had no complaints.   The regular fries were alright, but got soggy pretty fast. The sweet potato fries were great though! Both fry sauces were good too.   Compared to Gordon Ramsey's Burger, Bobby's Burger Palace totally blows it out of the water. The prices are better and the quality of the food is the same, if not better. We definitely liked Bobby's a lot and can't wait to come back!",

Everything was good except the bacon french fries - it was soggy.   I'll come back to this place again.",

I was surprise the prices are reasonable under $10 for a burger and fries prices are $4-5.  I had the new mexico burger and cheese fries.  The burger was very juicy and small in size like shack shake burger.  The cheese fries is tasty and not too crunchy with white cheese $4.50.  The staff are very friendly and offer suggestions which sauce to use on my burger and providing silverware.  There are mostly counter feel shaped in a S shaped or rectangle counters like a communal feel.  They also sell milkshakes and beer along with soda.  I would come back again. Next time I would try the onion rings. I seen the onion rings at other tables and they look huge and delicious.",

Almost as though my meal was ore-prepared  Cheap place to eat relative to strip prices ($18 for bacon cheese fries and drink). I am not sure I would return. I would have expected a more flavorful burger and fries that weren't soggy. I doubt this would be acceptable standards when this place was conceptualized.",

We weren't a fan of the toppings available, and the fries were horrible: cold, poorly cut and lacked any sort of seasoning or (on the flipside) memory of what was a potato.   I know it's \"good-food-served-fast\" but the service was also extremely underwhelming. The young girl at the register looked just thrilled to be employed... *note the sarcasm...*  Food came out pretty quickly, and is reasonably priced.  VERY annoyingly, they don't accept your MLife card there. We had already checked-out so couldn't book to the room. Even Starbucks will take your MLife card... wha? Not a big deal, but a bit annoying.  Either way, A-OK!",

Burgers were roughly $9-11 and Fries were $4. For a burger, fries, and a drink I paid what I thought would be for just a burger considering its a celebrity chef's place.   I got the Brunch burger and it was very good. Lots of flavor and the egg yolk was nice and runny. I tried the Burger Sauce on the side and didnt care for it much but thats on the table as an optional condiment.   My wife got the Burger of the Month, which was a Greek Burger. Her only complaint was it didnt have enough tomato but she's a tomato freak. She loved it and we both wanted to order another burger simply cause they tasted so good.   The cashier suggested only ordering 1 order of fries that they are enough for 2. That's True unless you're a fatty like us, next time I'll get 2 orders of fries as they are very good as well.   I look forward to trying their other burgers.",

You order and get a number and the servers come on by to give you your meal.  I really enjoyed the open seating area and the decor.  My bf got the Dallas burger and it was really flavorful, try it with the chipotle ketchup! I got the Breakfast burger since I love fried eggs in my burger and it was also pretty good as well.  I do have to admit that the Dallas burger definitely outshined my breakfast burger.  Portions are reasonable and filling and surprisingly enough, the burger didn't leave me feeling heavy and sleepy.    Don't forget that their specialty is to make their burgers *Crunchified*!  We almost forgot to request for it since we thought all the burgers here were made *crunchified*.  There's no extra cost for it and it sure does make a huge difference in the burger.  The texture adds to the whole experience of the burger.  Also, don't forget to try the sauces that they have at the tables.  Overall, Bobby's Burger Palace has good burgers at decent prices.  I don't think it's anywhere near the one of the best burgers that I've had but for the convenience, price and quickness, it's good place to try.",

Love his shows and I've taken my wife to eat at his Mesa Grill restaurant in Vegas, which by the way was excellent. With this current visit to Vegas with my wife we made it a point to eat at BBP. As we started our walk to the restaurant from the NY NY we passed by one burger place that had a line out the door. We both said \"wow, its a busy night tonight\". When we reached BBP and walked in there was only a handful of customers eating. Didn't think much of it at first and we proceeded to place our orders. I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger and my wife ordered the Maimi Burger. As we sat there waiting for our order to come out I immediately noticed the floors looked like they hadn't been swept for at lest a few hours. Straw wrappers, bread crumds and used napkins littered around the tables. There is a view of the cooks who seemed to be muching on food as they worked over the grill. Not good. The wait for the burgers wasn't an issue but the first thing I noticed when it came out was the size. For a $10 burger I was expecting something big. It was average sized, comparable to something you'd get from Wendy's. Immediately disappointed. Well it better taste amazing then. It was again average, nothing special. It wasn't bad but I was expecting Chef Flay amazing. I was starting to understand why BBP was pretty empty with customers and the place just down the road was packed. Hmmm, next trip we'll be trying that other place.",

The Fry's are terrific and could just east them. The Brunch burger has become a favorite among the guys I work with. Funny we were all hesitant to eat here thinking of the carton Bobs burgers, but when we found out it referred to Bobby Flay celebrity chef are worries were gone. To me I would rather eat here and be served quicker than waiting in the ridiculous lines that are at shake shack one block away. Bobby's wins the New York Burger challenge for us!",

The location on the Strip was very visible but a walk from the parking structure, but that is the case for most restaurants in Vegas on the strip.  The interior was different and fun...liked the layout of it.  Now for the food...I guess because of my experiences with Mesa Grill, I was expecting this amazing burger, fries, and onion rings.  The presentation looked tasty, but was not sold on the sesame seed bun.  It reminded me of a fast food bun, not a gourmet bun, which I was expecting.  The meat was good, but I have had better.  The fries and onion rings were tasty, and had a really good chocolate malt.  To sum it up...the service was good (friendly and helpful) and the food was good, but not great.  Next time, I think I will try one of the other burger hot spots on the Strip.",

I was expecting the egg dripping out when I cut it, no, yolk is cooked. The buns were flat like those you buy from the grocery stores. Need to put those chipotle and jalapeno sauces to get more seasoning. The salad would be better if it has more dressing, totally under dressed. For the price, we prefer Bachi Burger, that is where we will go again next time instead.",

The only downside to our ordering is that they were out of mint for the mint&chip shake.  Once we sat down a different young lady brought us our silverware.  She asked us how we were doing, and when we reciprocated, her response was, \"I feel really sick and wish I wasn't here.\"  WTheck?  After handling our eating utensils you tell us that you're sick?  (-1 star)  Needless to say, we needed to find new silverware.  The burgers were very good, as were the onion rings.  The rings are huge, so there is quite a bit of breading, as mentioned by other reviewers; however, the spices are really good!  The fries were WAY overcooked, so we didn't eat many of those.  The salad was okay - nothing wrong with it, just not to the flavor likings of the person who ordered it.  Shakes were great, but small.",

I ordered the Philadelphia Burger, cooked rare and it actually came out rare. Having your burger cooked to your liking is 75% of the battle with me. The bread (ugh, i ate carbs) was toasted perfectly, and the cheese and hot peppers/onions added a nice kick. My friend ordered the burger with the potato chips stacked on them and it was great. He also had his cooked the way he wanted it, medium. We split the fries, which came with a \"special sauce\", which was nothing more than a spicier McDonald's special sauce that comes on a big mac, however I ate all of it. The fries were good for what they were, I'm just not a fan of kettle cooked style fries. The ambiance of the place was alright...modern take on fast food. I guess my only complaint was the jackass who delivered the food and his piss poor attitude. All in all, I would definitely come back just for the burger.",

Good service and food, can't beat it, I would have given 5 stars but something about my burger was a tad salty and the bun wasn't as toasted as I would have liked. The regular fries are good but not amazing as one would expect from a restaurant with such a famous chef. My friend had the Carolina burger and that one was much better than mine! It had just the right amount of sweet but savory enough to balance it out. I ordered the palace classic which was good but plain just American cheese, tomato, lettuce and red onion. Sweet potato fries with honey mustard sauce was delicious!!!!",

My only complaint is I would have liked to see more veggie options, either more vegetables on the burgers themselves or a vegetarian option that isn't just a grilled cheese.

    "text": "You would think with a big name like Bobby Flay attached to this place, and more importantly a prime location in one of the most upscale spots in front of The Mandarin, Aria and VEEER, the burgers would be off the charts.  Not the case.    While the menu is creative in combination of options appealing to many different tastes, the actual burgers are not cooked to the standards one would expect from Flay.   Ordered a medium rare, and the temperature was bordering on medium / well.  It does appear they cook to order, but hard to imagine they haven't mastered the combination of grill and high oven finish to hold in flavor and moisture.  Buns were dry and \"blah\".  With a thick burger the last thing you want is hard dry bun -- makes it impossible to eat and get a full bit of the burger.  We also tried the turkey burger - stay away from that.   The counter order concept and service was great, but hearing folks sitting next to us also commenting on how plain and dry the burgers were confirmed Bobby needs to spend a little more time in this kitchen if he wants to protect his brand from ending up in a supermarket chain frozen section.  Several other celebrity chef burger places in Vegas have way exceeded this place.  It is still new, so we could attribute this to the \"teething process.\"  But it won't be here long enough if it keeps cooking these kinds of burger, even if the prices are very good compared to the competition.",

And I thought Bobby Flay knows burgers. Beware it's just the name but the food it's not what you expect for a seasoned chef like Bobby Flay. We always use yelp to help us with restaurant selections when we are away from home. It's like our guidelines for great food when you're traveling. I was very disappointed with the food. Though the service is good but our food is a very big disappointment.",

So you'd think  that if Bobby is going to slap his celebrity name on it, that the food would be great --- ha, far from it.   The two $9.00 burgers the wife and I order were pathetically small --- AND COLD !!!   Did I say cold?  Yep --- bodies at mortuaries have more have more heat than these burgers.   And the fries and onion rings that we each ordered --- yep, you guessed it --- COLD, COLD, COLD.      And COLD, COLD, COLD is what you get when you try to complain via good ole' Bobby's corporate website.   Not only do they have NO electronic method to send your comments, but they insist you write them a letter.   So basically, the COLDNESS starts at the top and funnels it's way down to the locations.    Save your hard earned $$$ folks while in Vegas, and find a place that serves good food.   There are sooooo many others to chose from.   And judging by the many, many, many other low ratings, this place will not be around much longer.   Besides, the corporation behind this place could care less if  you get value or not.   Remember, then really don't even want to hear your comments........",

The adult milkshakes (caramel bourbon) was tasty but just to rich to finish... Between two people...  Line was short, service quick. Seating plentiful and the decor was bright and fun. Burgers were $9.99 each which, although small, I thought was reasonable for the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  We split an order of sweet potato and regular fries and the group devoured those pretty quickly.  I would be back more often if Fuku burger wasn't across the street (see review) and if I had plans to go to Vegas anytime soon (I don't... For a LONG time time...)",

    "text": "I actually didn't want to love Bobby's Burger Palace. I wanted it to be overrated because I'm often underwhelmed by the food when I go to celebrity chef's restaurants. Maybe it is the expectation or the hype or the hefty price tags, but I'm never really all that impressed. However, my burger at Bobby Flay's Burger Palace was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The meat is delivered daily and is never frozen. Also, it is high quality meat so you can have the burger prepared rare all the way up to well done, instead of the standard medium that lower quality meat needs to be. I had the brunch burger, prepared medium rare. It had applewood smoked bacon and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg. They runny yolk soaked into the bun and made each bite unctuous. I also followed the recommendation of the hostess who took our order and had my burger crunchified, which is were they add potato chips to it. Amazing! We also had the onion rings/fries basket and thought they were well seasoned. The sauces were amazing. We especially enjoyed the BBQ sauce, which had an unusual flavor that had sweet and spicy notes. We believe the special ingredient was horseradish, but can't be sure. My husband had their burger of the month special which had BBQ sauce and onion strings and he also thought it was delicious, though we agreed my burger was the best. The service was impeccable, the food was delicious. We were disappointed that they no longer sell the sauces, because we would have bought them. This is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and you enjoy a good burger. Yum!",

We got the cheese and bacon fries and they were really good too! Overall the food really hit the spot and I recommend getting the burger with the chips on top it really adds a crunch that makes it even better (and unique to other burger places as well)! Prices are very reasonable so if you're looking for good food on the strip without breaking the bank I think this is the perfect spot!",

First off, the price was a little much and what do you mean fries aren't included?   Second, The New Mexico burger does not have New Mexico chile??? Yes chile with an E. Authentic Hatch green chile would actually made this a New Mexico Burger. Plus queso blanco on a burger? No, no, no I know you have been to New Mexico it is regular cheddar when doing a queso burger please!!   Upsides were that my burger was cooked perfectly and I had a delicious margarita. But I will  forever be disappointed in you Bobby. Maybe I will try Mesa Grill and see if you can win back my heart.",

I ordered the brunch burger and I grabbed some fries from my friend's order. The sides were enormous, so definitely share if you aren't starving.  My burger was good, nothing amazing, I had hoped for a little more flavor. The burger was cooked well, but overly salted, as were the fries.   Service was nice. They had staff walking around cleaning tables and offering refills and grabbing to go boxes.   Nothing was a standout but it's a good option on the strip for tourists in need of a quick meal for a good price.",

We also ordered some fries that's enough for 2 people. It came with some chipotle mayo sauce that was a little too watery but had an ok taste. If you like shakes, you should think about getting one. Their strawberry had small bits of strawberry and wasn't overly sweet. Perfect! My boyfriend ordered the dark chocolate shake - if you like dark chocolate this may be for you. It was overly chocolately for me.   We arrived right as the restaurant opened. The service was good and the staff was friendly.   If you're in the mood for burgers, fries, and a shake.

It wasn't open yet but we planned to stop here for lunch on our way back down to our hotel.  I'm mildly a Bobby Flay fan, as in, I love to hate him.  We came back just before opening and waited outside until 11am.  A few other people were waiting as well and the employees actually opened a little late.  I ordered the New Mexico burger which comes with white queso, roasted green chiles and pickled red onions, medium well.  My boyfriend ordered the Bobby Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato and got it \"crunchified\" which puts crunchy potato chips atop your burger (free!).  He ordered a side of onion rings and I got cheese fries.  We realized after we ordered the order taker hadn't asked how he wanted his burger cooked, so he had to go back up and tell her.  Once you place your order at the counter, find a seat in the very spacious dining area.  The little bar stools were comfortable and I found the decor appealing.  Our receipt had a bathroom code on it and I realized after several people came in just wanting to use the bathroom, why that was the case.  The women's restroom was dirty and unappealing, I had a feeling Bobby wouldn't be pleased - especially since they had just opened.  Our food came out a decent time later, and the server educated us on the house-made sauces provided on the table.  I tried each of them but honestly liked none.  My burger was excellent!  So flavorful and everything on the burger really complimented one other.  I could taste that the meat was good quality beef and well-seasoned with lots of pepper.  Cheese fries were rather blah and the cheese wasn't very cheesy.  He did not care for the meat in his hamburger and found the peppery flavor to be overpowering.  It did have quite a bit of pepper on it when we opened the burger up.  Onion rings were awful, I put one in my mouth to try it and immediately upon it touching my tongue I could only taste the overpowering flavor of flour.  No seasoning at all and no flavor.  Yuck!  I would come back for the New Mexico burger though, it's the best burger I've had in a long long time!",

They even put a very light dressing over the lettuce (maybe a small amount of vinegar and oil?). It's extremely delicious and we will definitely be going here again next time we're in Vegas.",

My husband & I both got the Northwestern burger,and sweet potato fries and onion rings and a cookies & cream shake to share. The burger was pretty tasty but presentation was sure lacking! It didn't look appetizing at all- plopped on a white (paper plate-looking) plate with a faded half pickle next to it. The onion rings & fry presentation was dramatic but we both felt the onions needed cooked longer and the batter was tough. The sweet potato fries were average, if not a bit soggy. The shake was excellent, not foamy like a lot of places nowadays. I guess I walked away with my crush heart disappointed but I can still watch him on food network and dream of how delicious his food would taste if he delivered it himself.",

It looked like a fast food joint but I know Bobby Flay is known for his burgers and I wanted a solid lunch without paying an arm and leg on the strip. I'm so glad we stopped here!  Our burgers were cooked to order and so moist and flavorful! The fries and onion rings are tasty and you have to be careful not to eat excessive amounts because they go down so easy plus your portion is huge. I was absolutely stuffed when we left but so satisfied.   You can seat yourself, it's bright, open and was very clean when we dined there. It's around $15 per person but so worth it. Oh, and do yourself a favor and try their alcohol infused milkshakes! The vanilla caramel bourbon one was delicious - I kept stealing sips of my husband's.",

The burgers we ordered were cooked exactly to our liking: I ordered the \"Las Vegas\" which was full of chilies and chipotle flavors. Surprise: there were crispy homemade BBQ potato chips inside! Loved my burger. The sesame seed bun was toasted and lightly buttered. I like how the bread didn't get soggy from the cheese and sauces on the hamburger patty.  The fries (we had both the sweet potato and the regular kind) that went with them were also homemade and delicious... we loved the different ketchups and dipping sauces available to try with the burgers and fries. My biggest mistake was not to buy a bottle of the chipotle ketchup to go! Nevertheless, I will be back and will not repeat that mistake again.  Great service, amazing food. No wonder Bobby is still the most popular Iron Chef in America!",

I have eaten at Bobby Flays other restaurants Mesa grill and Bar Americain and the food at both places were just amazing. I order the bacon and cheeseburger and a unsweetened tea. My burger was to be cooked medium. I went and sat down and saw the sauces on the table and checked them out. And tasted them all. I really didn't like the burger sauce to me it didn't seem right for a burger. I also tried the chipotle ketchup that was had a nice flavor profile. My burger comes out and I notice that it looked preformed, though I may be wrong that means it could be frozen. I remove the bun from my burger and put some burger sauce on it and try it again. I just did not like it on the burger. And the bread was not soft it felt a little hard. Though I had a not so great experience I will give it another shot when I return to Vegas, after all it is Bobby Flay..",

With that memory in mind, I had to check out BBP in Vegas. The beef is pretty high quality and I still felt that the burger itself was amazing. I had the Blue Cheese burger, which I highly recommend. However, I was disappointed with the fries that I ordered with the burger - they were a bit burnt. Thinking back, I should have sent them back, but I think the goodness of the burger experience overpowered the discontent I had with the fries. Overall, this is a great place to go if looking for a great burger. Can't wait to go back!",

It's one of those meals you know you could make better yourself, but instead you pay a million dollar chef to mess it up for you.

I was surprised at how casual it was and that it was not full service. That's fine, though. I told the nice lady at the register that it was my first and, in all likelihood, only time I would ever visit (I don't get to Vegas often). With that in mind, what should I not miss? She set me up with the Brunch burger, fries and a banana and Nutella malt.  I knew things would go my way when I sat at the table to find a carousel of sauces. I'm a sauce kind of guy. There was ketchup and mustard (nothing special) but also a jalapeno hot sauce which had a nice tang to it, a smokey chipotle ketchup (my favorite of the bunch), and a curiously named \"burger sauce\" which was peppery and sweet like molasses.  The burger arrived stacked high with a perfectly medium and juicy patty, quality bacon, a fried egg whose runny yoke was beginning to fill the bottom of the plate, gobs of American cheese, and potato chips. At first I was disappointed to find that the chips were simple bagged style but as I started into the burger, I changed my mind. Kettle style chips would be too much. These provided just enough crunch and salt to really compliment the egg. The pickle that accompanied the burger was thick, cool and crunchy. A welcome addition.  You guys. This is the best burger I have ever had. Seriously. The only thing that could (and did) make it better was a squirt of chipotle ketchup on every other bite.  The fries were equally impressive. I really got the feeling that some care and culinary science went into the preparation of these. They were flavorful. Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. With just the right amount of salt.  The shake did not disappoint either, though I felt pretty guilty after crushing the meal and chasing it with such a heavy desert.  I know I said I would probably not be back. But I've got a few more days here. I might make a point to return.  Job freaking well done!",

The second cashier/employee next to her was very friendly, and I had a nice, short conversation with him while waiting for her to sort things out.  My mint chocolate chip shake had a very strong, pleasant vanilla extract-like flavor.  The mint was not super strong, but was a nice aftertaste.  Not a fan of the communal seating, but it wasn't crowded so I could be by myself.  There was construction on the front half of the dining area, where one of the employees said they were going to install a bar.  I found it mildly entertaining that there was a Pizza Hut box prominently situated against the window both days I walked by.  I'd go back to try their food.  Good job, Bobby Flay.",

The fries, both reg & sweet potato were good & so were the onion rings. Only 2 onion rings came w/ the 50/50 order so that was disappointing. None of us cared for the buns/bread, they were thin & cold. We had shakes too & those were pretty good, really creamy but a little pricey for the size. Customer service was good overall. I was expecting more with the Bobby Flay name but I left with a happy stomach. I've had better & worse, but glad I tried it.",

The fries servings is more than enough for 2. The onion rings are humongous but not to my liking (I'd prefer straw onions anytime). The half half choice is more than enough for 2 hungry peeps. Service is great. And yes they have fork and knives when u ask. My husband and my order came to about $35 and thank God they have military discount. I love u BF! Parking is weird and we had to valet at Mandarin Oriental. Though the cashier said sometimes there is a spot at nearby CVS.

The veggie burger was not a patty it was like a fresh mixture as explained. So ...I agreed to the burger but was only able to take a few bites because it seemed to be mainly large pieces of mushrooms as a main part of the mixture, yuck I hate mushrooms! Everything else of the mixture was very good. Bobby flay I love your show ...my daughter and I watch you all the time with Ann on food network. You are an awesome cook, please make a veggie burger without mushrooms....I know it would be the best since you are the best!

The patty was tender and juicy. The onion rings were lightly battered and were fried to perfection. The cookies'n cream shake was smooth and not too sweet as well.  The cons: I got the Crunchburger and it was made just like any other burger. My burger was accompanied with a slice of American Cheese and a handful of potato chips. Yes, it was good, but it was not special. It was not memorable and and the burger was dry. I added some chipotle ketchup to it (which was one of the five sauces that was placed on the tables), and it added some flavor to it. The burger seemed overpriced for the mere simplicity and blandness of the overall burger. As for the sweet potato fries, they were a bit limp and bland as well. It was accompanied by a honey mustard and a ranch dipping sauce, but neither matched well with these fires. A sweeter ketchup may have been a better match to these fries.   Overall, the patty was delicious but the rest of the burger fell short. If you come here, maybe opt for a burger with more dressings on top.",

My husband and I are Food Network dorks, and I particularly love Bobby Flay. Very excited that he found a way to make his food affordable to people of all walks of life.   The food is relatively affordable considering you are in Vegas. The shakes are awesome and great for dipping fries in if you are also into that like I am. The Staff every time I have stopped in has been extremely friendly and willing to give suggestions.   Very clean and something I really enjoyed about this location was that they have a code for the bathroom. This ensures that they stay cleaner generally since it is directly on the Strip.",

    "text": "My husband is a huge fan of Bobby Flay. We watch his food Network shows all the time and make his recipes at home often. We went to Bobby's Burger Palace with our family of four. We ordered three regular cheeseburgers and a veggie burger. We also ordered sweet potato fries and onion rings. It was difficult to find a table that was clean. There was trash/used plates everywhere. Finally I just picked a spot and wiped it off myself. The music was so loud we couldn't talk to one another without yelling. The wait was made worse by the uncomfortable chairs, they are the kind that are fixed to the floor so you can't scoot up or adjust at all. Also, the chairs were so worn they are higher towards the back than the front so you feel like you're constantly slipping forward. My husband is very mild mannered and never \"rocks the boat\" so to speak. He sent his veggie burger back, said it was burnt and extremely salty. The girl said \"that's how they come\" but finally brought a regular cheeseburger. We all (except my husband) thought the burgers were good but excessively salty and slightly dry. fries and rings too salty also. WONT BE BACK. Super loud, uncomfortable chairs, long wait, salty food. Not worth your time or money.",

I had the Dallas burger which was loaded with coleslaw, bbq sauce and like I said it was fine but was not \"wow-d\". The fries were ok, a little limp but not bad overall as the portion size was decent. Decent oreo milkshake as it was enough to be shared for 2.  Service: Walk up counter to order and food is brought out to your table, no-frills. The hostess taking your order was great in that she gave a lot of info on the options and what was her favorites. The servers were helpful and attentive as dropped napkins were picked up immediately and tables were busted quickly as well them checking in once your food was brought to you.  Ambiance: Plenty of seating as the counters were set up as \"S\" community seatings but enough elbow room between stools. Bright decor and very inviting.",

First off, atmosphere is pretty chill... very colorful with a cool bar area with flat screens! There is also some cool photos of Bobby Flay on the wall.... and you order at the front counter and they bring your food to you!   Bobby's burger palace is right outside the Aria hotel and casino! It's a great location because it's right on the strip!  Now, we ordered a cheeseburger with fries and the burger was good... nothing that is out of the ballpark but it was a solid burger! They cooked it perfect for a medium rare.... but flavor was basic... the fries were good but it had the skin on it and some foodies like it, some don't! For me, I actually prefer no skin. The fries did come with a good aioli which is a plus!!   I would come back and try and different burger but it's a solid 3 stars.... service is good, place is clean, and food is pretty good....  Solid 3 just because I wasn't blown out of the water... but it's solid!",

The way they season the meat is to perfection, it has so much flavor and it's juicy. And the avocado relish is delicious. It beats habit, in and out, red robin, steak and shake, and shake shack. Sadly this location is the closest one to me. But i will definitely come back to eat here. Their ingredients and meat are very fresh and their onion rings and sweet potato fries are so good. The onion inside doesn't get soggy it still have the crisp and the sweet potato fries and just the right amount of salt and crunch. I love their sauces for the onion rings and the fries i think it was ranch and honey mustard.",

Kicked Gordon Ramsey's ass ten times over. It's funny because Bobby's is meant to be very casual, you just order at the counter and take a number and they bring you your food-but the quality/flavor is soooo much better than Gordon Ramsey's burger place (and I feel like that's meant to be fancier).  We also got the undecided (you get to pick 2 sides) and got regular fries and sweet potato fries also a pistachio milkshake because they were out of the Mississippi mud pie. Good but it kinda tasted more like vanilla. Overall great experience.",

    "text": "Who doesn't get seduced by a celebrity chef restaurant? Vegas has tons of them. Hey range from the higher end Wolfgang Puck to the super casual Guy Fieri.  So we're craving a burger and Bobby Flay's joint popped up.  After viewing a few pics of highly stacked burgers, we were in.   Located on the street level in front of Mandarin Oriental, it's a partial service burger joint.   You walk in, get in line and study the menu on the wall.  Place your order with the cashier and she'll hand you a # to place on your table.  They bring the food out once it's ready, and will clean up the table when you leave. Everything else you get yourself.   Our order:  * LA Burger w chips, avocado relish and watercress. 3/5. Good but the avocado overpowered everything else.  * Bacon Crunch Burger, essentially a bacon cheeseburger w chips. 3/5. A bit salty & cheesy. He bottom bun was soggy & flat. I had to flip it around.  * Undecided, which is the name of side order of any 2 items.  We chose fries & onion rings. Three Onion rings sitting on a small bed of fries, they looked crunchy and seasoned but immediately fell apart at the slightest touch. Batter quickly became crumbs. The fries were mostly short pieces and dark in color (i.e. leftovers) had to depend on the BBQ dipping sauce, which was actually good. Fries were not.  2/5 * Blueberry cheesecake milkshake, a small cup of nicely made shake. Not too sweet but quite small for the price.  3.5/5  It's a spacious area, able to accommodate many. All seating are on stools and all tables are long communal types.  High ceiling with modern lighting, positive quotes and obviously staged photos of Mr. Flay trying to look candid make the decor very fitting of a Vegas vibe. I just wish the food was better.",

Some burger places actually forget, that it's not all about the meat and fancy sauces.  The menu itself is very simple, with only a few choices, but that is more than enough. This also makes it harder to find something you don't like.",

But this should be about the food and experience, so lets focus on the food for now.  I enjoyed the different types of burgers based on local regions and went with the Dallas Burger. The meat in the burgers was good, and the dill pickle was a nice touch. The food was decent in my opinion, the steak sauce they put out could have been better.  But overall not the worst burger, but not a wonderful experience. My friend claims the hotdog made him ill, he did not want to go that  night because of it. That is another story.   Better than fast food.",

It was hard to catch a waiters eye to request my burger be cooked further. When I finally spoke to someone, I got a very strange reaction. He seemed annoyed by my request and did not respond but appeared to walk towards the kitchen and I think he asked them to make me a fresh one which they eventually did. I was waiting a while to get it and I wasn't sure what was happening. I asked the same server if a burger was coming. It took about 15-20 minutes for another burger to arrive. I felt awkward and left in the dark due to the fact the server never told me what exactly was going on.   All this aside the flavor was good and I enjoyed the taste. Just a bit of an awkward service.",

He needs to do away with the prefixed menu and have burgers any way you want them.  We should be able to mix and match and have it the way I want and not 1 of the seven types. Why don't you have a vegan option? I like veggie burgers.   All the reviews said to try the sauces? Hmmm their are no labels on them. I had to get a employee to explain the sauces evidently your labels rubbed off the bottles? Are you kidding me? Get a new system!  The drink choice are also poor. Get with the system and get some better upper end sodas and not a soda machine I can find in any fast food restaurant. Please get a wine dispensary not some plain wrapped wine nobody knows anything about.  A choice should not be white or red. Maybe rather California wine? Or Australia or Washington? This is not a good representation of him or his good with this concept. Nice way to make a few bucks.",

I had just arrived in town and dumped my suitcase off at the hotel, took off my MN winter clothes and put on my Vegas bumming around clothes and headed out.  It was off peak time, so it was pretty quiet.  I love the fact I do not need to walk a million miles (that's dramatic) through a casino to get to this place.  I like that it's on the street.  I was the only one actually eating a meal and couldn't decide what to get since everything looked good.  I settled on the the Chicken Breast Miami style, a half order of fries and rings (to split) and a diet coke.  We sat at the counter and food took a decent amount of time to arrive.  Sandwich was good size and the sides big enough to split so I'm glad I had a dining companion to finish them up.  My food was decent and I have a feeling if I liked burgers or had ordered a turkey burger I would give it 5 stars.  I got what I needed out of the meal and would go back for a quick lunch.",

The burgers are small, dry and tasteless( despite it being cooked medium rare as I ordered).   The onion rings and sweet potato fries were just okay.  I ordered a chopped salad as well-the avocado and watercress were missing, it took about 10 minutes to get it on the side after I brought it to the attention of the staff.  My small dinner salad sized salad ended up being $15 (I added chicken). The burgers start at $10 and the fries are $5 a side.  Ridiculous prices for the poor quality-go to Burger King or Carl's instead.  The only bright spot was the staff.  I feel sorry for them working at a place with such bad food.",

We got the fries/onion ring combo along with the premium margarita and the cactus pear margarita.    The burgers were excellent, both cooked perfectly to order.  Crunchifying each burger seemed unnecessary as they were pretty rich to begin with.  I thought the New Mexico burger was slightly better because it had a nice kick of spice with the green chilies.  The fries and onion rings were awesome as they have a few different sauces you can try including chipotle ketchup.  The only reason for 4 stars is the cactus pear margarita wasn't that great.  The premium frozen margarita, on the other hand, hit the spot.    I know there are a lot of celebrity burger joints in Vegas, but I would definitely recommend Bobby's.",

Good but the sauce was a little over powering. Getting it crunchified was brilliant. Next we got Miami which was my favorite. Over salted but after scraping a little seasoning off it too was pretty good. Huge amount of fries in their combo of regular and sweet potato fries. And the fry sauce was amazing!! Super fatty and not something I would normally use but I pretty much drenched everything in it.   The prices are really decent (again why i wasnt expecting much...see tip on Buddy V's tourist trap at the Venetian that tastes worse than Buca's) I'll definitely come back.

I also got the half & half sides - I chose sweet potato fries & onion rings.  Both were cooked perfectly.  I loved the onion ring batter.  The sweet potato fries were crisp & divine.  I didn't care much for the dipping sauce (honey mustard horseradish sauce) - mainly because I hate any & all things mustard.  As for a drink - I opted for a spiked milkshake.  I got the Vanilla Caramel Bourbon shake.  It was amazing.  The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars was because one of the friends that came with me didn't get their order correctly (she ordered sweet potato fries - they brought her regular fries) & when it was brought to the attention of the server who brought out the food, she first argued with my friend & then said she would \"see if the fries could be made\" as if there was a possibility my friend might not get what she ordered.  It was taken care of but I didn't care for the attitude exhibited at first.  Oh & they don't have ranch.  That's always 1 less star in my book. Ha.",

The restaurant is not intimidating and I didn't feel like a loser eating by myself.  The fellow at the front said that the \"crunchified\" Brunch Burger was his favorite, so I gave that a go. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I also ordered the half and half fries and onion rings. The fries were among the best I've had. The onion rings were nice and tender. I burned through a lot of napkins on this one, but it was worth it. I wasn't a fan of the fry sauce our the other sauces on the table, for that matter, but the food didn't really need it. I don't think I'll have ongoing cravings to come back, but I will eat here again the next time I'm in this area and need something quick and tasty.",

Big meat, but overall size of burger was pretty small. We ordered med well, but perhaps medium would've made for a juicier burger. Fries were excellent. Crispy, fresh, not overly salty. The sauces unique. We liked the burger sauce. Whatever it is he puts in it, makes a much better companion to the burger than ketchup. MUCH better. Ambience and service great. Its not something Id eat again and again due to price but I can definitely see myself craving it every now and then. Or maybe tonight...lol.",

Don't get me wrong, they are good burgers, but just burgers.  If you want to experience Bobby, go to Mesa Grill-that's Bobby Flay.      As the other reviewers have stated, service was an issue.  Couldn't get our tea refilled for quite some time with very few people in the restaurant.  It seems as though the slower a place is the worse the service.  If in Vegas with a car, go to In-N- Out Burger instead.",

    "text": "I am still teetering on giving this place a one or two stars. Completely not impressed. As someone else said they expected so much more from a celebrity chef's restaurant. I did also. So I go there towards the end of lunch, around 12:45, to my surprise the place is empty. For a restaurant on the strip just ending lunch, there was NO ONE in there. Should have been a warning sign for me.  I was never a fan of Bobby Flay on tv or any of those celebrity chefs on the Food Network, but I would always want to at the very least try their food.  I have tried Mesa Grill and I that place really didn't impress me either.  I got the Philly Burger, the concept wasn't bad. But this is where my issues start. I ordered the burger, medium rare. When I got the burger it was closer to well. I also ordered it \"crunchified\" but there were no chips in my burger. The onions were cut too larger and when I bit into the burger, the whole onion came out. The bun didn't taste as fresh and the burger was just, meh. Biting into the burger the bun was a little hard and broke apart and the burger fell apart when I ate it. I ordered onion rings, which tasted pretty good, but they were HUGE! like way to big, it was like eating half a whole onion. I only got like 4-5 pieces.  I did like the chipotle ketchup, it complemented my burger, since there was no sauce in my burger. I got my burger to go, so I didn't see any of these things until I got back to my hotel.  I don't think I'll be returning, this place showed so much promise, but came up flat.",

    "text": "Bobby's is by far our favorite burger place in town. You order in a fast food style where they take your order, give you a number, grab your drink and grab a seat. The seating is kind of weird where it's a whole table wrapped around with a bunch of chairs so you MIGHT end up sitting with someone else, but hey, maybe you can make some friends! :)  We have never had to wait in line a long time to put our order, even if there are several people ahead of us. They're usually pretty quick to get everyone through the line. The wait time for the food to come out is pretty standard, but we like to sit by the window and watch the people walking the strip so it makes the time go by quicker.  My husband and I usually both get the LA Burger and it is fantastic! So juicy and full of flavor. We have been there 5-6 times and the burger has always been the same quality.   The fries are awesome too (haven't tried the onion rings yet) and the fry sauce is really good. Usually fry sauce is just a mix of ketchup and mayo but this is so much more and has a little kick to it. We also tried a coconut shake once and it was filled with flavor and even had little flecks of coconut in it.  This is a fabulous place to eat. The staff is friendly and the food is definitely worth the price. I would suggest looking on the website first to see the hamburgers, some of them are a little different than normal hamburgers.",

    "text": "So, I'm trying to scout out good American places to eat in Vegas for a friend that's visiting from Japan in November this year, and I decided to try out Bobby's Burger Palace. My friend really loves In-N-Out Burger, so I figured she would want to try other good burger places. I came in here on a Tuesday in April around lunchtime before my flight back home. No line in front, didn't seem like too many customers sitting down. I went ahead and ordered the  Classic Burger with a strawberry shake to go. They claim they have \"The World's Best Shakes\", so I had to try it out right. I requested my burger to be cooked medium rare, as I like it a bit on the tender side. Burger came out within 10mins, and I took it back to my hotel at the Excalibur to eat in the dining area upstairs. I took a bite out of the burger and from the first bite I could tell that it didn't really meet my expectations. I guess it really isn't meant to be eaten like a regular fast food burger, but the patty was a bit charred on the outside and it was extremely salt, like it was sitting in salt water.  I didn't want to waste my money, so I did eat the whole thing.  The shake on the other hand was pretty good. World's best shake? Probably not, but it was pretty good. I think Shake Shack's shake is a slightly better and a little bit cheaper. Why the hell are the shakes so damn expensive here? Probably because they're on the strip. I still think In-N-Out and Shake Shack have better burgers as well.. Well, sorry Bobby, but I won't be coming back by myself unless I get dragged in here by my friend.",

They do serve alcohol here with beer. I went with the classic burger and combo fries with onion rings. The burger was cooked to my liking and the chips added a bit of crunch to the burger. Fries were crispy and the sweet potato fries were a standout along with the onion rings. Loved how each table came with a variety of sauces. Each sauce matched well with fries dipping but my go to has to be the chipotle sauce which went with my burger and fries. Nice place for a burger but not a standout.",

When I got the burger, the patti was barely warm, the burger had a good flavor but it seemed that the avocado relish condiment and what seemed like a tomato pico de Gallo like just didn't let the beef shine and be the star.  The whole burger was barely warm.  Same thing with fries, the cheese was melted and they tasted really good, but they were barely warm.  Sadly I will not go back!",

Came here with my family and we all ordered different burgers and they were all delicious. I love how they were named after cities/states.   You can choose how rare you want your patty and they actually serve it to you that way! I'm so used to having over done burgers. I prefer mine medium rare and I always get close to well done.  I order the Miami (pressed with ham, swiss, pickles, mayo, mustard) and it was the juiciest burger I've ever had.  They give you the half/half option when it comes to sides. But the portions for fries/etc are a bit small. There is also a variety of sauces on the table, all yum!  My sister ordered the pistachio milkshake, because we love pistachio anything, and it was great. Not overly sweet and just the right consistancy.  The decor was very modern and had that southwest tex mex feel that attains to Bobby's cooking style. Fast food feel, where you order up front, but they bring your food to you.  Good job Bobby Flay! This made me love you even more.",

The fries were soggy and cold. The turkey burger was extremely salty and the LA burger was good. We \"crunchified\" the burgers with potato chips and it was a terrible decision. I was expecting the chips to be homemade rather than lays chips. Overall, we were expecting more from this place given that we follow Bobby Flay's cooking and we have visited other restaurants of his which were good. In my opinion, in n out is way better my far and fresher. We will stick to going to Mesa Grill when in Vegas.",

My hubby had a green chilly burger with just the right amount of spice. There was a variety of sauces on the table, jalapeno, chipotle, and barbecue to enhance your burger experience. So... was it the best burger I ever had? No, but it was really good, inexpensive for Vegas and easy. It is an informal, but comfortable setting and the staff are very helpful! I hear the milkshakes are the bomb! If you need a quick bite, and did I mention there is a bar and multiple TVs, I highly recommend Bobbys Burger.",

I \"Crunchified\" that shit! There is an option (free) where you can get potato chips crumbled all over any burger you order. Groundbreaking culinary stuff right there. The burger, although salty as fuck, had a pink middle and a bit of a char for a properly cooked medium slab of meat.   The American burger was the same thing minus all of the flair. Salty. Just another hunk of meat between some bread for $10 bucks.  The fries were okay but a little, you guessed it, salty.  No wonder Bobby Flay is always losing on his show. Cut some of the salt out and drop the price (these are not special burgers) and BBP might be able to compete with already over-priced burger joint chains in the area who offer a better product.",

You can order a 1/2 and 1/2 and can try both. We did that it then ordered another round of onion rings, because onion rings are never amazing.

We sent it back to try and get a medium but it came out just the same, we gave up on it. My vegetarian burger I order with no cheese and no mayo, it came out with only a slice of tomato and a couple pickles and a sprinkle of lettuce(again half of the topping off on the plate). The other reviews were raving about mushrooms in it and that it was amazing.... mine seemed like it was just a bunch of quinoa smashed together(it was falling apart). The only thing they didn't mess up was the fries we ordered and onion rings. Not impressed to pay over $35 for just decent fries and onion rings.",

The minute you walk in the door you smell the food cooking and your mouth starts to water. They have several types of burgers on the menu and fries and shakes and depending on your taste they also have turkey burgers. I had the crunchy bacon burger which was amazing. The burger was cooked perfect and I loved the chips on the burger. Definitely something different for me. The sauces they have to dip your food in and your fries are amazing. I love the Bobby's barbecue burger sauce and the chipotle ketchup on my gosh A must try. My brother had a jalapeno barbecue and he loved it. I also had the pumpkin shake which was very good and I love how they give you a Big straw so it's easy to drink. The service was great food an came out on time and was cooked perfect, as we all had different ways we wanted them cooked. The restaurant was very clean and very busy. I also love how you can sit at the bar and order your food as well instead of ordering it when you first come in. The only thing I found a little annoying was Parking. You have to park in the Aria parking garage to get to it because there's no parking on the street of course because it's on the strip.  Even with that it was still well worth it. Everything else was amazing. I never probably would have tried it if it wasn't for my son visiting and taking us there. But I can guarantee you I will be back Bobby burgers definitely represents Bobby Flay.",

If I could figure out the magical seasoning formula, I would make it the mandatory mix for every burger in the world. My world, of course.  The onions and peppers accented the burger perfectly, without overwhelming it. All the various sauces were fun to sample.   I didn't find out about the whole crunchify thing until it was too late, but I probably don't need the extra calories anyway.",

Food on the floor, spots on the floor, and dirty chairs.  I saw crumbs all over tables,  I witnessed a server rake a few crumbs from the table on to the floor, then she must have realized there were too many so she took the menu and gathered them into her hand.  More crumbs still remained on the table, and at no time did I see a server actually use a towel to wipe down any of the tables.  I saw a patron come in and use a napkin to wipe the table she was sitting at, and I observed a server watch her do it and did not step in to clean.    If the front of the house is like this for all to see, I cringe at what may be happening in the kitchen.  Three stars because I enjoyed the LA burger that I had and the Margarita was tasty too.  Please, I ask that more attention is taken to cleanliness.  It was not crowded so there was no excuse for the condition of this place.  Although my burger was good, not sure if I would return based on the untidy atmosphere.",

In my line of work, if I don't deliver on a promise, I lose business.  I am writing this commentary from Holstein's back at the Cosmo hotel.  Wondering what thedo to make sure I ever return to a BBP location.  Update- Corporate asked me for my email address to forward to this location on January 3rd and then again on January 5th (not sure why two times).  I replied and I still have not heard back from this location.  I'm sure I will never go back to any Bobby Flay's locations.",

The bbq sauce on the Dallas was unremarkable and the Cole slaw was average. Same bun issue. Onion rings were good (not great) but a small portion soured is on them. Nothing wrong with the place as it's advertised as a casual burger bar. We just expected it to be outstanding and it wasn't.",

    "text": "The wife wanted to experience all her favorite TV chef's cuisine during our recent trip to Vegas so we ventured to Bobby' Flay's burger joint for stop #1.   I expected more, especially for the lofty price. What we got was a couple of decent burgers, but nothing we couldn't get at a dozen other burger places, honestly I think Johnny Rockets has a much better burger. I got the Bobby's blue, and I am shocked to hear myself say this, because I love cheese, but this had too much cheese. Could not taste the juiciness of the burger it was so drowned in cheese. My wife had the classic which looked to me to be a fairly run of the mill burger.   We also ordered a half and half fries and onion rings and were presented with an anemic order of fries that was barely enough for 1 and TWO onion rings. The onion rings were not even the same size, bringing the spectre of conflict into the picture as the two patrons must then choose who gets the bigger one. C'mon, two freaking onion rings? This was a $5 side order and was supposed to be half and half. Perhaps the other half dozen onion rings were MIA, I don't know.   Service wise, the place was empty, but somehow our burgers came out 5 mins in advance of our drinks. Unacceptable. As for drinks, I ordered a strawberry shake, which taste wise was fine, but here again, the glass was not very large, it didn't come out with the metal carafe with the rest of the shake, and for 9 bucks I would have expected a hell of a lot more.   Summary, unless you are absolutely dead set on trying a Flay spot, pass on his palace, its extremely poor value, mediocre service and palatable but rather ordinary food.  Edit: I did get an almost immediate response from the BBP social media person promising they would address the shortcomings in my review with the LV location management. I will not change my review, but kudos to the social media manager for being on top of their feedback.",

We are visitors to the Las Vegas area and had to stop in here, because we absolutely love Gordon Ramsey's BURGR, so trying out Bobby Flay's joint was a must! The burger combos are interesting, but neat and surprisingly good! The shake was good, but very overpriced for the size. The onion rings were amazing and the cheddar ranch was delish! Nice ambience for a quick meal too!",

    "text": "Stopped in for an early lunch just after they opened.  It is located in front of The Mandarin and a short walk up from the Aria and City Center.  I love Bobby and wanted to try his burgers.  Knew I would crunchify anything I chose, why not?  It's  Bobby's signature burger move!  This is a walk in and order at the counter, they give you a number and then you find a seat joint.  There are long communal tables and round bar style tables.  I ordered the brunch burger medium rare which came with burger, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese.  Added lettuce, tomato and pickle at NO extra charge then crunchified it, also no charge.  Came out quickly and cooked perfectly.  The server that brought it to me said, \"Good luck,\" which I am guessing is because I created a huge burger.  I pushed it down to allow the egg to crush and the chips and then dug in.  The meat was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The flavors were all perfect together.  The bacon was crisp and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  We also ordered half fries and half rings.  Best onion rings!  Crisp, perfectly seasoned...just delicious.  The fries were great too.  All of the sauces on the table were tasty and fun to try.  I got to try Bobby's BBQ sauce, jalapeno sauce, Chipotle ketchup... all great with the rings and fries.  Burgers are all around $9.50 and the half and half side was $5.  All so reasonable!!!  All sooo yum!!!  I also liked the fact that it is really casual and they offer, beer, wine, margaritas and spiked milk shakes.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came to Bobby Flay's burger joint because of me. I actually believed a celebrity chef's place would offer the best burgers in town. Well let me say we were both disappointed, and my fiance kept saying \"You said these burgers would be good.\"  Well first off we were here once before for the Kahlua Vodka Mocha milkshakes. They are so good, so this time with our shake we decided to to try a burger and fries.   Our burger arrived without the fries.  When I looked at the receipt, i noticed we were not charged for it, and by the looks and the taste of the burger, my fiance, said, \"forget it now, it's too late, and they probably will not be that good either.\"  The service is horrible all around. We watched our milkshake sit on the chef server counter for at least 10 minutes, and still none of the staff brought it to me, so I decided to go up and get it myself.  The burger was on a lousy cheap small bun, the kind you would get at McDonalds. The size of the burger was not much bigger than a regular burger at McDonalds either, but for almost 10 bucks, not including the fries, which are $4 extra.  No use thinking about the fries that we didn't get anyway. Let's go back to the burger. It was very salty and skimpy and someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand with the salt.   There were two guys sitting next to us who were also disappointed in the same way. They said they came because of good reviews on Yelp, but after seeing the size of the burgers and then tasting them, they claimed that the Yelp reviews were BS, and they must be staged, as part of some marketing ploy by a marketing company posing as legitimate patrons, or employees of the restaurant.  You would imagine that Bobby Flay would give his patrons a good thick juicy burger that is perfectly seasoned, considering his reputation and the price, but no!   Maybe he wants to pretend the joint is in Paris, but even in Paris at good burger places, you can find a much tastier bigger burgers.  I asked the staff if Bobby Flay ever comes to the restaurant to check on it, and they claim when he does he works in the kitchen, so I am not sure if this is his recipe done correctly, or how he runs his restaurant, or if it's a case of the \"When the cat's away, the mice will play.\"  I have not tried anything but the Kahlua Vodka Mocha milkshake and the burgers, so I can't say anything for now about the french fries or onion rings, but if the burgers they serve is any indication of what the rest of the food would be like, my fiance and I both agree, save your money and go somewhere else, especially if you know good food, this was a complete disappointment.   Bobby Flay or no Bobby Flay, this restaurant will not stay in business long with the horrible service and the quality of the burger and bun.  We say stick with the milkshakes if you do decide to eat here!",

    "text": "Sadly, our first cuisine stop in Las Vegas was a bit of a disappointment.  While having two lines for eating in and take out is great.. if you are not manning the \"take-out\" line... you better have some kind of signage that points that out to people!  Starting off 5 minutes later.. we ordered, I went with the original crunch burger, and the girlfriend opted for a more \"spicy\" option of the Vegas burger (when in Rome right?)  We took our seat and enjoyed a bit of some great music, and the food arrived in a suitable amount of time.  Not incredibly impressive for what we paid (almost 30 dollars).. my burger was a lame little burger with plain potato chips on it. I know.. Bobby Flay tries to paint it as more.. but it's not much else. The giant pickle is the most impressive part of it.  The girlfriends was much of the same.. a pathetic little burger with a stack of BBQ chips on top...   It was an interesting concept.. but really I feel like I could do it myself like that for much less, and might even taste better. My burger was just an unseasoned beef patty, and the chips just overpowered anything else with the amount of salt on them. Just meh.  My girlfriend, a couple of bites in.. started to complain about the heat of the burger (spiciness)... and took the Fresno red chilies.. which (and I love heat) were uncomfortably hot. It hurt somewhat to chomp them down for her.. but we did finish them off.  Overall just an over priced joint with average food. The one saving grace was the tunes playing.",

The next is that I ordered the onion rings and sweet potato fries. The fries were awesome and the burger was okay. I also ordered a shake and it kick butt however the onion rings were like onion rings that had been served and were not eaten so they battered then and fried them again. The coating on the rings was so damned thick and layered I'm almost positive that they are recycled but I can't say for certain.  The place is currently under some type of renovation with yellow tape roping a lot of the dining area off but there was plenty of room and the burger and fries were edible. The onion rings were not even something I'd feed my dog and sadly the burger was overlooked. I had really expected quite a bit more being a Vegas destination.  I wouldn't steer clear but I would go in with my expectations somewhat managed.",

Make a \"concept\" selection, choose either burger, chicken, or turkey.  For beef burgers, choose a doneness level.  Opt for plain or \"crunchified\" (silly addition of chips in the sandwich).  Done.  The decor looks like a burger exploded.  Ketchup red, mustard yellow, golden bun, grilled beef brown.  Burgers are cooked to order, relatively juicy, decent beef flavor but grossly under seasoned.  Not good for mild burgers but welcome for spicy creations which are SPICY.  Toppings are fresh.  The Philadelphia Burger (provolone, griddled onions and hot peppers) packs a spicy punch but is good eats.  The LA burger (avocado, watercress, tomato and cheddar cheese) is so mild the burger is lost.  Definitely NOT a fan of the \"crunchified\" burgers.  The addition of chips adds a distracting textural contrast and nothing to the taste.    Simple sides.  The beer battered onion rings best of the bunch.  Fries just OK.  Soggy at times.  The mayo, roasted red pepper, chipotle sauce it's served with is spicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries with honey mustard horseradish sauce is a better choice.  Very good, rich milk shake with pronounced flavors (the pistachio is worthy!)  Excellent service.  Overall, inexpensive for the Strip but not worth the pilgrimage or the wait.  This is Vegas.  X times the money does equal X times the pleasure.",

Let me start off by saying I loved the atmosphere and the convenient location of the soda fountain. The interior is very retro-mod, and very stylish! Each table has an extensive array of unique sauces to compliment your meal.  I had the \"Bobby Bleu\" ($9.50) which is a bleu cheese burger with bacon (I only got it because it was the only option on the menu with bacon beside the one with egg in it :::yuck!:::) It was delicious! I loved it, aside from the part I felt like I just deep-throated a salt-shaker. I also had the crunchburger option, which was to add chips, and I really enjoyed that along with the flavor of the meat itself.  The beer battered onion rings were not the business... I seriously saw LUMPS of salt adhered to each piece. I only had one piece and couldn't finish the rest. These were $4 for about 5 pieces...  The service was great, but I don't think I would be back to Bobby's Burger Palace unless someone's treating me! Haha. I ended up spending a little under $20 on a burger, fries and a small fountain drink... I pay about $11 in Los Angeles for the equivalent at Hook Burger, sans the potato chips.",

    "text": "Finally, a reasonably priced gourmet burger spot in the center of the Las Vegas strip!  Located right next door to Pinkberry, BBP is sitting immediately in front of the Mandarin Hotel.  If you valet at Mandarin, you can walk right into BBP....only a few steps away.  If you feel like self parking, Aria will do the trick...just a bit of a walk.  All the food is priced higher here in comparison to the online menu.  Not a big deal considering the location and prices of their competition, but just know and expect it.  Once you walk in, your order at the counter and get a number...they bring the food out to you.  There are napkins and lots of house-made sauces sitting on the tables, so it's far from full service but with plenty of helping hands around to answer questions or to remove plates.  On to the food!  New Mexico Burger ($9.50): Queso Sauce, Pickled Red Onions & Pickled Jalapenos. This was very good! Initial juices flow out on the squeeze, the burger was cooked perfectly (MR), and the toppings added lots of flavor! Wish their Queso sauce was a bit thicker like their Mesa Grill counterpart....which this reminded me of strongly.  A pic for comparison :  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FMgu4d11_d6aXxLxvExrz_g%2Fl.jpg&s=f90db9e2866ef1318ba72837936815703b1162ea85cbfa2db7a0d76f9866a899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  French Fries ($4) with BBP Fry Sauce. These were cooked well-done+...not sure if they are supposed to be that crispy, or if mine were cooked too long. The fry sauce is good, kind of like a mayo/chile aioli.  Wish they were seasoned a bit more like Mesa Grill's Southwestern Fries...those are delicious!   Or at least give us an option for a seasoned fry :)  Vanilla Bean Milkshake ($6.50) with Whipped Cream. This was very creamy and rich...easy to drink! Wish there were adds like Nutella, Chocolate or Oreos though!  So overall, a very good burger at a good price!  I'd recommend it esp if you are walking around on the strip :P",

    "text": "In Las Vegas, there is not such a thing as \"too many\" burger joints. So with that said, welcome Bobby Flay, and your addition to the Las Vegas strip. Thank you for bringing a decent priced, good quality burger to my place of residence!  We have Burger Bar, Strip Burger, KGB's, BURGR, and many more I haven't mentioned. All of them have a good quality burger, and everyone has their favorite.  I am happy to say the Burger Palace can easily be added to this list!  Decisions are the hardest on a first visit. We went with the Brunch burger and Philly burger both crunchified. (Added homemade potato chips). A fries, and onion rings, and a pistachio shake.  The shake was delicious and I will come back for that alone.  I like my burgers well done, and I like when a place successfully still makes a juicy well done burger. I'd say this needed about 2 minutes less cook to be perfect but it still was good. The sauces on the table were great, but the real winner is the honey mustard horseradish that you have to ask for.  All the ingredients on the burgers were fresh, and you could tell. The cheese was high quality and melted off the sides of the burger.  I ate every bite, and was perfectly full.  Also, they give you a points card, where every dollar spent is a point and at $100, you get a free burger. We spent $40 so within a 3rd visit you will earn that burger. It is free, so definitely worth it.  Can't wait for a second visit, and this I would choose this place over at least half of the other burger joints in this city. Great food, service, and prices!",

    "text": "Surprise, surprise! Bobby's Burger Palace is serving up delicious burgers, on the strip, and not charging crazy high prices! Is this real life?  While they may be going for the \"gourmet\" burger category, it isn't quite like any other gourmet burger spot on the strip. When you walk in, there's a huge menu on the wall and a counter to order at. Unlike a lot of other spots that are full service, at BBP, you just order and they bring it out to you.  There are several options on the menu for burgers. If you're not the burger type though, you can order any burger style but swap out for a different protein. Alongside the certified angus beef, they offer ground turkey and whole chicken breast. The rest of the menu features sides, salads, sandwiches and beverages. Since they're on the strip, they're also serving up beer and spiked milkshakes.  I decided on the Crunchburger, a simple burger with double American cheese and topped with potato chips. I've gotten in the habit of trying just the meat every time I get a burger somewhere and BBP's was great. The meat was tender and seasoned very well. It seems like they are a little heavy on the pepper but I actually enjoyed it like that. I wasn't a huge fan of the bun though as it was a bit dry. Altogether it was a great burger but I'd like to see them use house made chips to top it. I could be wrong but they sure tasted just like plain ole Lays. It also needed a sauce but luckily each table has a few to choose from and their jalapeno hot sauce really set the flavor off.  We also ordered The Half & Half sides with fries and onion rings. The fries are delicious. They actually fry them a bit on the harder side so they are a nice, crispy brown on the outside but still soft inside. I'd like them to be a bit saltier but they are served with a really tasty fry sauce anyway. It's a mayo based sauce with red pepper that is creamy with a very slight bit of kick. I think it would actually be really good on a burger.  One of my favorite parts about BBP was several little signs they have up front indicating how they cook their burgers. I ordered mine medium, my wife ordered hers well done...they cooked them right and exactly how it says on those signs. To me, that's a great thing, it saves a lot of headache, and possible stomach aches. And even though they aren't full service, everyone was very nice and happy to get anything you need or answer any questions. To top it, we walked out of there for under $30. If you're on the strip and craving a burger, give BBP a try!",

But after wading through masses of crowds all day and bleary eyed from cigarette smoke, this was a warm and welcome oasis! (I could hear myself think and relax without any bumbling, drunk idiots further north on the Strip.) I ordered the Dallas angus beef burger with the \"can't decide\" - sweet potato fries and onion rings. My daughter ordered the kid-friendly crunch burger. Great that you can choose ground turkey or chicken breast, in addition to the angus beef, which was a perfectly juicy medium-well.  Loved the various sauces Bobby Flay's known for: spicy jalapeno, creamy BBQ, smoky chipotle ketchup, sweet mustard, and even the ranch was the best I've ever tasted! The onion rings were crispy with a nice, peppery crunch. I also got the frozen pink margarita- it had a very smoothly blended ice texture, and was so delicious! My burger was a scrumptious balance of sweet, tangy, and spicy. Total tab without the tip for two burgers, regular fries, the \"can't decide\", a bottle of water, and margarita, was $42. I'd say this place seemed really kid friendly, could be a cozy date place, and the long tables were great for large groups of family or friends. The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is due to the soggy, thin, bottom bun. I took it off because it was overly mushy from all the juices that came out of my burger. The service was attentive and excellent.",

The woman who took our order was super nice and the woman who delivered our food was super friendly as well.  It's hard to know whether this restaurant has waiter service or not. You order at the counter and then find your own table, but after paying the cashier tells you that tips are appreciated at your table for your waiter. You get your own drinks and refills, but someone brings you your food. I don't think this constitutes as a waiter. Some of the waiters topped off their customers drinks, but no one did this for us. We went through the end of our meal with no water because the machine ran out and no one came to fill up our waters. For not having the veggie burger in stock and not having enough water for the meal is the reason for 3 stars.",

However, I ordered a cactus pear margarita.. it was the worst margarita I've ever tasted. Although it was pretty, there was no cactus pear flavor at all.

Only thing we didn't like about it was the bbq sauce wasn't what was stated on the board.   It would have been a 5 star but the guy at the counter couldn't answer half the questions we asked and our burgers were over cooked.   But still delicious!",

And his burger place is the bomb,I was in heaven since I am Bobby's super fan, it looks like a fast food place but with class, with an 80's vibe decor, they have pictures of Bobby Flay's quotes in the walls and I loved it!! Very affordable prices, and tasty burgers and fries, we ordered two classic palace burgers without the onion, my friend had the well done and I ordered the medium rare which was juicy and delish and perfectly cooked, we got the undecided side which was half onion rings and half sweet potatoes fries, and it was enough for the two of us to share, all the sauces were in the table, everything was sparkling clean, great costumer service, friendly staff and helpful when we asked them about the menu, I even asked them if they knew Booby and they told me: of course he is the coolest boss ever, he pays unannounced visits here an there (hopefully I will be lucky enough to see him one day)and I absolutely believed them!! It must be a dream come True to work for a celebrity chef like him! I can't wait to find out what other Bobby Flay's owned restaurants have to offer! But this one right here I will come back again if life bring me to Vegas in the future!! A place worth to try in Vegas Strip my dear Yelpers!",

I ordered the burger of the month, the Mulberry Street Burger, which had fresh mozzarella, basil ketchup, parmesan cheese, and baby arugula and I swapped out the burger for chicken. I really hope BBP makes this a part of their regular menu, it was delicious! Nothing was really hitting me on the regular menu, so when my friend pointed this out on the sign, I immediately decided that's what I was going to get and it did not disappoint!  We were given a number and sat down and the food was brought out. The one issue was the timing was a bit off. I placed my order right before my friend did, but I had completely eaten my sandwich by the time hers came out. The waitress did apologize though. My only other suggestion would be for another side option besides pickles to be offered.   Overall, the chicken breast was very moist and I loved the combination of flavors, especially the basil ketchup and parmesan cheese, I was trying to wipe up every last bit of the sauce on my plate with my bun!",

    "text": "I met up with a friend visiting from out of state on a Saturday for lunch at Bobby's Burger Palace. Located along the Las Vegas Strip at the Waldorf Astoria (formerly the Mandarin Oriental), this is a counter-service casual burger spot owned by celeb chef Bobby Flay.   After you order and pay at a register,  you receive a number and find your own seating. I personally found the stools a bit uncomfortable, but I did like the bright, modern decor.   As for the food, burgers come with your choice of beef, turkey or chicken. You can also specify how you want your burger cooked, which isn't always an option for customers at burger places for some dumb reason.  You can add crunch (potato chips) for free. Do it. Even if you are skeptical, it's really good.  I had the Palace Classic Burger, which is just a cheeseburger with the basic vegetable toppings, served with a pickle spear. My burger was thick and juicy, a nice size for $8.50. Burgers come without condiments but there are a variety on the table, including chipotle ketchup and burger sauce.  Sides include regular or sweet potato fries and onion rings. The onions rings were very thick cut, I wasn't a fan of them.. but I loved the sweet potato fries with the delicious honey mustard dipping sauce. Grilled cheese, a salad and a veggie burger are also on the menu for non-burger fans.  Service was good, food was brought out fairly quickly and an employee stopped by to see how we were doing.  A party of three each had a burger, three sides and one soda for under $50, which is not bad for the Strip. I would return to Bobby's Burger Palace if I was on the Strip and craving a burger.

First I'm on a low carb diet, and if I hadn't have been staying at the Waldorf I wouldn't have eaten here. The lady at the counter was exceptional, she knew the menu and explained the no bun option.  The burger was excellent, cooked perfectly to order and the sweet potato fries were spot on, the mustard sauce they came with definately had some mustard in it, unlike many that are just flavorings.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the time I went there was ni wait at all.  Great food for a great price.  If you're on the strip and looking for something tasty, that won't empty your wallet, then give this place a try.",

The woman at the register had to ask the manager and then kept repeating to me that \"they don't usually do that,\" and kept making it seem like I was out of line for asking, even though I repeatedly told her I would pay the difference. Frustrating but after riding the struggle bus we figured it out!   On the plus side, the food came out quickly and it was delicious!! Big portion and the veggie patty was thick, flavorful, and on point! (If you're vegan be sure to ask for no cheese).   The restaurant is laid back with a bar and large tables so you can bring in a big group or share a table with strangers. Kind of fun! Not a great spot for an intimate moment but lots of options and worth checking out.",

That all being said the customer service and staff were outstanding. Special thanks to Stephanie and Jennifer for taking care of us this evening.    More reviews on instagram - foodingwithbobo",

Service is very friendly and \"chummy.\" They want you to feel like you're with friends so don't be offended at sarcastic comments followed by a chuckle.  Laugh with them and you will have a good time.  We ate here twice during this business trip.  Veggie burger (order it crunchified - they add potato chips), the vegetarian salad (delicious), onion rings (fantastic), and fries (fresh and hot).  A few tips:  Tip the servers when you order.  To eat the very very tall burger, just remove the skewer and press down on the top, this compresses the chips and makes it manageable.  Highly recommend this place for a quick (and very filling) bite.",

I would rate Gordon Ramsey's place a little higher and this one about the same as Holsteins from a food perspective. It would be better if the place wasn't a McDonald's type atmosphere.",

I ordered the bacon bleu burger with added chips (no cost extra) and bacon cheese fries.  The burger was huge! However, I felt like the patty was dry, and I expected it to be more aesthetically pleasing. It looked like a burger patty I could buy in a pack of Costco. Overall, the burger was ok.   I didn't realize there was an assortment of sauces until after I started eating my burger so I tried it with the bacon cheese fries. I was expected crispy fries with loaded cheese and bacon. There was a light sprinkle of cheese. It was mediocre at best.  I heard Bobby Flay does come in time to time to check in, and I really think he should do some flavor quality control with this place. I expected better and I have to say I was disappointed.",

For $10 I could get a better burger from Shake Shack down a few blocks or Fat Burger across the street. So I would say this one is more like a tourist trap joint.",

The burger was a perfect Medium Well and has to be one of the top burgers I have had. The seasoning was very good and Bobby's Burger Sauce was a good addition. The bun was fairly mundane.  The only problem we ran into was my shake was apparently given to the wrong table and had to be remade. It took longer than I thought it should, we actually started to think that they had forgotten with a staff change.  I am not sure what was supposed to make the Shake Cherry Blossom flavored. I tasted plenty of cherry flavor and it was quite good. Not too thick, not too thin.  I would definitely make the trek back again when/if I return to Las Vegas or am near another location.",

The Onion rings were fantastic, crunchy coating nice seasoning, just right.  The OK:  The fries were good but a little soggy with grease, I prefer crunchy fries but with the fry sauce they were good.  Beer selection was just ok (at least add Miller Lite).  The bad:  the egg was cooked well done and should have been sunny side up, so no good yolk flowing over the burger.  Overall: Better than Gordon Ramsey's burger place in Planet Hollywood. However, Grill Marks at home (Greenville, SC) is as good as either of these place.  Do I recommend: yes!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try a Bobby's Burger Palace for a long time and finally made it this last trip while in Vegas. I have to say I expected prices to be high and quality to be mediocre because it's right on the strip and you tend to get the median of things but I was so pleasantly surprised! The venue is large and can fit a good amount of people with fast service and a separate bar if you want to add drinks to your meal or hang out, rich with colors and awesome photos of Flay's creation. But let's get to the burgers.   I decided on the Bobby Blue; a thick burger with blue cheese and bacon. It came out medium rare, just the way I wanted it. I did add some roasted green chiles to the burger to add some spice and it was definitely the right call. I had split order of onion rings with fries and each was just so well made and of great quality.   Definitely a place to stop by for a burger where the focus is the burger and not the distractions. Next time I will have to add a shake!",

I'm not a burger guy because I don't like my hands getting juices on them when I'm eating, I'm a fork & knife kind of guy.   But since I went to Wahlburgers last week and  I'm back in Las Vegas, and Chef Bobby Flay is one of my all time favorite Chefs, I had to try this joint.  We were there at 11am ready to chow down.  Well again Bobby did not let us down, everything was awesome (as expected) and when I left all I could thing about is what I wanted to get on my next visit.  The location is set outside of Aria Casino so it's easy to get in and out, the place is very clean and open.  My only suggestion was the French Fries (which are skin on) were a bit over cooked for my liking but still very good. I got the Philly Burger with Grilled onions, hot peppers and Provolone. Kailey order the Green Chili burger which had pickles, onions and green chilies with cheese. We also got the undecided which was french fries and fresh fried thick batter red onion rings, yeah it was awesome.  You want one of the best burgers in town (it's the best I have found so far) then Bobby's Burger Palace is the place for you.",

The purple Margarita was fantastic. The menu is designed to choose everything al a carte. So you can have beef, chicken or veggie burger. I recommend to order the onion rings as well. They don't give you any utensils. must wash your hands before you leave cause it will become messy. If you are looking for a quick delicious burger that is very reasonable this is it. Parking is a little inconvenient and takes a little walking which will help you digest the burger. I was expecting a little more exotic combo burgers but overall, good job Bobby Flay.",

Toppings not very fresh, patties a little dry, buns too soft, and the shakes we're watery. The strawberry shake was all syrup, no berry. The fries were mediocre. They have better fries at the burger place in Aria. Not what we expected from a Bobby Flay-branded burger joint. We won't visit again.",

Sat by the kitchen first in the serpentine bars.  Nice concept that lets people sit and interact but was too hot from lights and kitchen.   Moved to a more standard table.  We ordered before we sat down but service was slow.  Server was nice but overwhelmed either by deliveries or a kitchen that was slow.  Had to get our own silverware, served burgers first and didn't see fries/rings until much later.  I had already eaten my burger.  Had to ask for my drink (beer) after I had finished eating since the food was a drop and run.  Onion rings came in a large pile that turned out to be only four deep, they were placed on top of a tin cup.  Was shocked to see how few there were.   Probably won't head back.",

They gave my friend a water cup instead of the fountain drink she ordered, and they acted as though it was some inconvenience to them to give her what she paid for. Same thing when they brought me the wrong side, the look on the server's face made me feel like it was somehow my fault. I asked another server for a box, and it took like 10-15 minutes for me to get tired of waiting so I got up to get it myself. I sat near the kitchen as well and watched to go orders sit there for 15+ minutes while they continued to focus on those dining in. And on top of all of that, the food was just meh. Do yourself a favor and just put your own potato chips in your burger. I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends and family just because the service was so terrible.",

The chair were uncomfortable though. And far away from the counters.  You order at a counter and then find a place to sit.  Someone will bring your food out.   I ordered the Brunch Burger cooked medium. Angus beef, over medium egg, American cheese, and bacon. Pure deliciousness. And actually cooked to a medium!! (They have a burger temperature chart at the register when you order. Smart) I have found that the bacon on burgers usually isn't all that great. This one proved me wrong. My egg was actually still runny, the way it should be.  And the cheese... It was actually melted and delicious.  It seriously like exploded in my mouth.   My boyfriend ordered the Vegas burger and raved about it forever. He loves his burger medium rare, but usually doesn't receive it this way. For once, he did. It was still dripping and all. His mom ordered the New Mexico burger and also loved it.  They have a bunch of different sauces at the counters: chipotle ketchup, burger sauce, jalapeno hot sauce, fry sauce, etc.  The only thing we didn't enjoy were the fries. Both the regular and sweet potato fries were overcooked. We did 1/2 regular fries and 1/2 onion rings for one order. It only came with two (delicious) onion rings :/   Bobby Flay himself was there. We went over and said hi.  Service was extremely attentive. Plates were cleared quickly, refills were offered even though it's self service, etc.   3 burgers, 2 sodas, 1 bottled water, 1/2 fries & onion rings, and sweet potato fries = $47  Will return!",

We both really liked the meal in fact, we raved about it to each other  for most of the trip. She had sweet potato fries and I had regular and a chocolate shake. Couple little thing would have put this experience at an excellent.  1.) my fries were good but quite salty. 2.) the shake was good, flavourful and thick but it was a regular 250 ml plastic glass for $6.50 which was a bit pricey in my mind. It's not fancy with whipped cream or cherries or big glass or anything like that. Just a good ol milkshake but if it was at a more reasonable price point my sister would have had one too. 3.) the biggest issue: the service sucked. We went in around noon and asked when they closed that night and were told midnight. So round 9:30ish we go over thinking we'll have plenty of time. We were one of 4-5 people in the restaurant and the staff seemed to be closing up. We were there for maybe 45 minutes and at the 25 minute mark things felt super rushed. The plates were taken away without being asked it we were done, the stink eye was given.   Side note: when debating if we should try Gordon Ramsey or Bobby Flay's burger joint, we noted that Ramsey's is in a casino which was filled with smoke, Bobby's is a stand alone place with no smoking.",

    "text": "It's Friday, 12 noon and we are number 5 in line at Bobby's Burger Palace. Two registers for ordering made the wait relatively short. At the time we placed our order the line was out the door with 15 people behind us. Great idea of having separate lines for ordering in dining and take out. It definably reduced the overall wait time.  My choice was the Vegas Beef Burger cooked medium rare. My wife's choice the Classic Beef Burger cooked well done. We also shared an order of Onion Rings. The onion rings have a nice texture and are cooked perfectly. One order is enough for 2 people  Bobby has the bases covered. You can order your sandwich with beef, turkey or chicken. You receive a number when ordering then choose a location to sit. The food will be delivered to your table. Wait time was acceptable and the wait staff explained the sauces available on the table. During our meal a server stopped by and asked if everything was OK and if we needed anything else.  Both burgers were cooked just as ordered. The Vegas Burger has cheese, BBQ potato chips and red chilis on the sandwich. The chips add a nice crunch and are a nice twist. The Classic comes with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sliced red onion. Also the burgers are served with a nice crisp pickle.  The restaurants decor is bright and colorful. The seating arrangements are good for groups as well as individuals. The wait staff continues to make the rounds to remove the plates a clean the tables. Looks like another winner for Bobby Flay and Las Vegas",

    "text": "Was psyched in trying out Bobby flay ' s burger joint. At first I was disappointed because they weren't vegetarian friendly. They didn't have veggie burgers in their menu. so I just ended up ordering their griddled cheese and my man tried their original crunchy burger. My griddled cheese had good cheese in it.. but the sandwich was kinda mushy Because of the juice of the tomato which was in b/n the cheese and it tasted salty as well and to top it off the pickle just made it more salty.   According to my man his crunchy burger was juicy but it tasted salty too and the chips in between just made it more  saltier.  They must have placed too much salt when they seasoned their burgers as well as the tomato/salsa of my griddled cheese sandwich.  The service on the other hand was great! I liked how the staff were so attentive. The interior of the place was nice too for a burger joint.  The price wasn't really worth it though. .",

I spotted Bobby's place which was a mix between fast food and restaurant. You order your food like a normal fast food joint, but is cooked to serve. There are only ten burgers, four sides, and salads to choose from. I was really pleased because it was the right mix of quick and sit down to relax. Plus the burger I got which was the Miami and My wife got the Dallas are versions of a Cuban and pulled pork burgers. Excellent with great sauces. One of top two or three burgers I have had. Would eat it again if we had one of his places closer. I definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "Our trip to Vegas was business and pleasure. In my line of work it's hard to do one and not the other. Our hotel was a little bit off the strip so making your way to Bobby's was quite a walk but well worth the trip. My two other friends had eaten there the night before and they were still as excited as if it was their first time. This is was my second time the Bobby Flay's and although I wanted to try something different I decided to go with the sure thing and I went with the New Mexico burger. The burgers are thick cooked to order, Angus beef steak patties that was covered with Monterey Jack cheese green chilies and onions. A pickles wedge and side of sweet potato fries completed my order. It was delicious burger that was perfectly cooked. Cheese was still dripping out from between the bun....I did remove the top bun to stay on the lighter side of the carb spectrum and I guess I could've had them wrap it in romaine lettuce leaves but I decided to live a little and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I must also add that the service there is fantastic and the employees are super friendly and very courteous and very engaging and want to know how your food experience was and they are willing to make it right anyway they can. kudos to Bobby Flay not only in his burgers but in hiring superb help. I will be returning to eat these amazing burgers again and again and again.",

    "text": "This location was right around the corner from my hotel and directly on the strip so great! Being the FNW fanatic I am I had to try. So I got the burger of the month Cheyenne Burger grass fed beef with sharp cheddar smokey bbq sauce topped with buttermilk onion rings and bacon. Washed that down with lemonade which wasn't housemade just Simply brand and a combo of reg and sweet potato fries. Sounds delicious right!? Well it was kind of a let down here is why #1 when it was brought table side no onion rings on top!  #2 my bun looked toasted to the eye but it was soggy once drenched with the gobs of bbq sauce #3 it was room temp. I ordered it medium so it was cooked to perfection  but I didn't care for the bbq sauce I've made better at home. The burger itself would have benefited from some good ole s&p and the fries were good but those onion rings were the star they were absolutely phenomenal and gave the burger the flavor it needed. I'd return just for those onion rings! Another friend ordered the same and it failed to impress her as well but another loved it so aye. Also another patron ordered bacon cheese fries which is on the menu with scallion but neither received. So the kitchen needs to pay attention to small details. I'm not naive enough to think just bc its Bobbys restaurant we should have perfection bc it isn't him cooking just his name. However I definitely expect some standards which I didn't see. All in all I'd go again that Brunch burger caught my eye and those onion rings are a must have again! Who knows I might get a shake also they looked delicious",

Took about 15 mins for us to get our check after flagging down a random waitress. Customer Service is definitely a huge area of opportunity for this place. On the upside the alcoholic beverages were delicious.",

Palace quinoa tasted fresh and innovative, and with the ricotta and almonds in it, it actually filled me up. Dinner for five people came to $84. Reasonable for the food, but pricey given the atmosphere, which is very casual / garish, similar to Chipotle. At Bobby's, you order at the counter, take a number sign to your table, and wait for a waiter to bring your food and drinks out to you.",

Service was friendly and they seem to have a pretty good system to get food out.   For burger and a beer you're looking at about 15.   Not bad for being just off the strip",

The meat was super moist but still had a great char. Perfectly seasoned and the flavor combinations had my taste buds doing the #harlemshake  Super soft bun that soaked up all the juices from the meat. The patty was just the right size. Maybe 5 or 6 oz. Nothing to make you feel like you got a gut bomb. Then accompanied by a simple pickle. Out of all the fancy 5 star, expensive restaurants, this place trumps them all.

Then without any condiments the meat wasn't well seasoned, it had good char flavor, but so does burger king. Overall, not worth the $12 dollars.",

Although the burger was good, it missed the usual flair and signature kick of a Bobby Flay establishment. The food felt rushed and assembly lined and the loud colors and immovable chairs felt like a Che McDonald's. I drove five hours from California and left disappointed. Go to the real thing if you're in town and don't waste your appetite unless you're looking to save a few bucks. Mesa Grill was leaps and bounds better but I guess you get what you pay for with regards to quality, innovation, and creativity. I would compare this to a smash burger or something similar.",

The onion rings and French fries were also really, really good. I would definitely come back here again and think it is worth the ~$20 for a burger, fries, and soda. The design of the place is modern and cozy, yet has a retro feel in its DNA.   One thing that disappointed me however, is that it participated in that strange tipping culture that's somewhat popular in Vegas. I waited about 7 minutes in line to give my order to the lady at the register/counter, which is fine. However as I'm giving her my credit card to pay, she asks me if I would like to leave a tip. I haven't received the product or the service yet and I'm being asked if I want to leave a tip?? A little annoyed, I said no.",

No complaints after we ate our burgers-good tasting meat!   Great experience with service too! The service from all of the staff was attentive and made us feel at home in Vegas.

I was super indecisive but ended up ordering the \"Dallas\" which has \"spiced-crust, coleslaw, monterey jack cheese, pickles, bbq sauce, potato chips\" ($7.95) w/ free potato chips (thought it was going to be on the side but it's actually inside the burger!?) and a side of regular fries which comes w/ the BBP fry sauce ($3.50). Food was out within 10 minutes. The burger was so tall I actually had to take out the potato chips and eat it with a fork and knife. But that aside, the burger was juicy, patty moist and bbq sauce tangy, buns nicely toasted, and pickles to lighten up the mood. Your typical standard/solid burger. The fries  were nice and crisp (though I could do crispier) and lightly salted. Not a fan of the BBP sauce though (the horseradish/mustard-y taste was too strong for me) so ended up using bbq ketchup (Bbq burger and bbq fries? Never too much bbq).   Overall, solid meal for a solid deal. Would come back but...not before I cross off shake shack on my bucket list.",

    "text": "We love burgers, so had to try a Bobby Flay restaurant.  The dark chocolate milkshake was awesome, but at $6.50, a bit pricey.  I had the classic burger and my husband had the Philadelphia.   The burgers were fine, but nothing special.  Loads and loads of sesame seeds on the bun, thick burger and a nice array of sauces you could try.   The Philadelphia had HOT peppers that were hot.  We also got the split order of fries and sweet potato fries.   They weren't very hot, so again, nothing special.  So for $40 we got burgers, fries and shakes.   I think Five Guys are better as they are juicy, their fries are always hot and it's not as expensive.  I think Bobby needs to change things up as there were hardly any customers, unlike every other restaurant in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Ok, So This is my turf! \"Burgers and BBQ\" and this is my NO BIAS review of Bobby's Burger Palace @ Vegas. Menu is excellent with your pick of meat \"Beef,Chicken,Turkey\" or \"Vegetarian\". Shakes are \"ridiculous good\", Onion rings are the crunchiest I have had in my LIFE! and the main course \"BURGERS\" WOW! Excellent flavors coming out the patty, It was like bitting a piece of burger heaven in your mouth. Perfectly cooked as you choose \"I asked mine medium rare\" and the portion lets say it satisfied this guy a lot \"me\" :) Also when it comes to service I have to mention \"Enzo\" our server, what a wonderful knowledgeable, polite and empowered guy! He knew exactly each sauce ingredient and recommended some great ones, he explained to me the whole cooking process and even mentioned that Chef Bobby Flay visits the place at least 4 times a year! He made us feel like Royalty. Need I say more? A unique burger with creative, original, innovative, imaginative and ingenious mix of flavors and excellent balanced sauces. Bobby's Burger Palace in Las Vegas is no joke! You have to visit this joint if you come to Vegas, trust me! and lastly between burger and onion rings is around $18.00 !!! Excellent deal for the strip Specially if you compare it to my prior reviews of other Burger joints at Vegas. Buen Provecho! Good eats! #flayforall #lasvegas #bobbyflay #1973latinjoint Chef Oj",

I tried the ginger ale because I was thinking, \"well, the water doesn't work, so...\" and it came out as soda water. Not the best with the fountain machine.  If I was on the strip again (and let's be honest, I only go down there if family or friends are in town) I would stop in again, if only for the onion rings (Yrrm) and maybe to try a  milkshake.

    "text": "My wife was craving for a burger for lunch so I suggested to come here. We ordered the following:  Dallas Burger $9.50  Philly Burger $9.50  The Undecided (onion rings and fries mix) $5  Blueberry-Pomegranate Milkshake $6.50  My burger was pretty good. The coleslaw's acidity helped mellow the sweetness of the BBQ sauce and the richness of the cheese. My wife said her philly burger was good also. The onion rings were probably the crispiest ones i've ever tasted with a nice, thick batter. The fries were good too and not greasy. The milkshake was great! It was rich but refreshing at the same time. I though at first that the milkshake serving was too small for $6.50 but when we finished it, I was stuffed.  Overall, this place is a good \"cheat day\" resto. I think what really makes this place good are Bobby Flay's sauces/condiments and its prices. I really enjoyed the jalepeno sauce and burger sauces as they really add another layer of flavor to your burger. And for value, I think its noteworthy considering Gordon Ramsay's burgers are around the $13-$18 range. Oh ya, you can \"crunchify\" your burger (add potato chips) for FREE! Good job Bobby Flay and crew!",

Classic cheeseburger and the undecided (mic if fries and onion rings).    The burger was a bit on the small size, which isn't all bad.  But there was nothing special about it.  White wonder bread nun with light toast on it.  Burger was cooked properly but not especially flavorful or juicy.  It was on par with a quarter pounder.  The onion rings were cold, over fried, and greasy...not good at all.  Fries were Luke warm...any nothing special. Little crunch, very bland.  Given Bobby Flays reputation i had much higher expectations.  Do not recommend it give all the other chouces in Vegas.",

    "text": "A friend and I met here for lunch.  I was nursing a hangover and thought a burger would do the trick.   On entry, the colors and bar-counter & stools and booths make it more like a fast food place than a restaurant.  We sat down first and staff told us to go to the front and order and they would bring us our food.    I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger.  It had Angus Beef, Blue Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato, cooked Medium Rare.  Growing up in the midwest, I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers and this was a good burger.  I thought I would eat only half and ended up eating the whole thing.  I did not try the fries nor did I get chips added to the burger.  I drank a water to hydrate, while eating my burger.  However, while I was ordering my burger I noticed they had Spike Milkshakes.  I had asked the clerk, which spike shake was the most popular and her response was the Vanilla Caramel Bourbon.    As I was finishing my burger, a staff member asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered the Spike Pineapple Coconut Rum Milkshake without whipped cream.  (I thought it was funny that I could order and pay for shake while seated, but when I first walked in, I had to go to front register to order and pay for my burger).  The shake was thick and sweet (I could barely taste the booze), but there was no way I was going to finish it.  While sitting there, 2 other friends walked in.  Because the seating style has stools on both sides of the bar, our friends could sit across from us to chit chat.  Nice.  Finally, as I was leaving, I was planning to leave the shake there when a staff member asked if I wanted to have my shake placed in a to go cup.  Yes!  Glad they offered and I could take it back to my room.",

The onion rings were flaky and crisp and well seasoned served with a creamy ranch dipping sauce.

All of the burgers have the FREE option of being \"crunchified\" by topping them with crunchy plain bagged potato chips. on the side you can order Ala Cart Fries and Onion Rings. The overall price is about 25% less then the majority of other celebrity burgers on the strip.  The best part....the Burger is actually very good. I ordered the basic classic all American cheese burger with double cheese, bacon and all topped with the potato chips on a Sesame Seed bun. When my burgers were brought to the table the Bacon was missing so I let the server know. Not only did he immediately bring me the bacon for the burger but also extra bacon on the side to make up for the mistake, SCORE !  My burger was cooked just right. Medium well, moist but not pink with a nice crust and flavor that reminded me of burgers my mom would cook me in the cast Iron pan growing up.  On it I had a choice of Ketchup's and Mustard's. The Classic Hines or some that were house made. My favorite was the Jalapeno Mustard which was slightly sweet with a little heat.  I had some very good crispy fresh fries on the side that were perfect for dipping in the mustard. The onion rings were not as good, as they were a little less crunchy and a little more greasy. Next time I would do fries only. Simone had a Carolina Burger that was topped with Honey BBQ Sauce and Green Onion Mustard Slaw. She also had a perfectly cooked burger which she really enjoyed. I thought the slaw was a little overpowering with the flavors of the onion but she loved it. She also had chips on it and borrowed some of my extra bacon to put on it. So overall this is one of the better places for a burger on the strip and its much easier on the wallet then most.  I would definitely recommend Bobby's Burger Palace.",

The burger, the fries, the price are the reasons Bobby wins this Vegas Strip best burger challenge. Both burgers were very tasty. Bobby's fries wins and the price of the entire meal was way less.",

Now let me say, I have eaten at just about every burger place,including Gordon Ramsey's, Hubert Keller's, and Michael Mina's, on the strip and I have to say, with the additional sauces, this beats them all!!  The jalapeno sauce was just the right amount of heat with the fresh taste of jalapeno coming through and the chipotle ketchup was also great!!  The fry sauce and horseradish sauce for the sweet potato fries were awesome, the onion rings would have been better has they been cut thinner and more crisp.  The burgers were juicy and excellent!!  Definitely will come back!!",

The cashier was very friendly and offered to cut the burger in half so we could easily share. There were a variety of sauces and the chipotle ketchup had a mild kick that was perfect. The fries were generous and skin on salted super crispy. Perfect.",

It lived up to Mr. Flay's reputation in every way.  More importantly, the staff were polite, cheerful, and helpful.  This was a significant contrast to other Vegas restaurants where the staff were downright toxic.  We loved eating at BBP Vegas and will make it out first stop next time we come to town.",

It was a nice clean place and the service was very good.  If you are looking for a good burger I am afraid that you will be disappointed.  It makes me wonder if Bobby really has anything to do with the food.  If you are looking for a good burger, try Johnny Rockets or any place else.  The burgers here were not satisfying.  Forgot to mention that the fries and pickles were the highlight or our dining experience.",
