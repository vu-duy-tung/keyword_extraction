    "text": "Know what? The food here isn't half bad. I mean lets face it, there are literally over 1,000 places to eat in just a 1-2 mile radius; and they all rank from 1-5 stars. So it's hard to compare all these places on the strip to each other.  So lets say you are staying at the Luxor (Check) You don't feel like walking or waiting in the taxi line to go to another hotel (Check) and you want a decent breakfast but not fast food (Check). Come to Pyramid Cafe! Yes they are going to be overpriced for the meal you get (Duh) that's expected on the strip. But their food is actually pretty decent, which honestly surprised me. I ate here twice. I had the breakfast skillet ($12.99) with a side of pancakes ($8.99 ish) one morning. I can live without the pancakes *Blah* but the skillet was pretty darn good. I would eat it again. The next time I came I had the Country Benedict ($12.99) which was good as well. I would rate the food 4 stars. Service...ummm...although the servers were super nice, they were slow to take the order, and slow to bring the check. Yes both times they were super busy, buuuuuut, they were not on top of their game. I've been to several places that are busy ALL the time and in comparison the speed of the service at Pyramid Cafe wasn't the best. Period. But overall 3 stars for this Cafe. If I stay at the Luxor again I'll definitely will be eating here again.  Note- They only serve breakfast & lunch. They serve breakfast until closing (1pm) and serve lunch from 11am-1pm.  ***Update Coming here twice 6 months later...I have decided this IS a 4 star place. I've never been disappointed with the breakfast! The food IS GOOD! And actually worth the wait!",

    "text": "Headline: Slow and average....  I'm staying at the Luxor Hotel this week, attending a conference next door at the Mandalay Bay.  So I need breakfast.  The Pyramid Cafe is the Luxors 24x7 restaurant, located on the ground floor ideally situated so you have to walk through the casino to get to it.  At 6am, I expect the restaurant to be quiet.  However, they conspired to make it busy by opening up only the patio.  As a result, there was a 20 minute wait for a table.  There are no \"grab a pager and go gamble a little more\" - you get to wait in line.  Since it was a patio, the noise of the casino flooded in, making it loud.  You could hold a conversation, but you wouldn't be able to whisper trade secrets (or sweet nothings) here.  The patio has your basic patio furniture for tables around the center and booths around the edges.  No frills - just your basics.  My waitress - Stephanie - was bright and cheery, not pushy, and there when I needed her.  Just what you need at that time in the morning, so five stars for excellent service.  I ordered the coffee, which was tending towards the milder side - no starbucks bitterness here.  This was smooth.    I also ordered the corn beef hash and eggs - the corned beef was described as \"home-made\"... if by home-made, they mean they got it out of a can, then I agree with them.  However, that isn't my definition of home-made.  The corn-beef hash was that very common type with small pearl-sized potatoes.    The first batch came out cold.  And I mean refrigerator cold.  Not even warm.  So, of course, I sent it back.  I didn't even try the eggs.  Stephanie came back quickly apologetic with a piping hot plate.  The eggs on this plate were also done as I like them, and the hash browns were your typical shredded potatoe variety with nothing to dress them up.  So this was sort of disappointing.  Five star service with One star food, makes it a two-star place in my book.  This is not a place I will be returning to.",

Walking in seems like an ordinary dine-in restaurant (in a hotel), yet in VEGAS everything is most of the time known to be: outrageous, CrAzY expensive and extremely packed with decor. Well... not here, just waiting in line you notice a lot of different verities of cakes in a Look-See Glass from both ways.  So, as we were seated (waiting around 5-10 minutes at max) GREAT TIMING... I was browsing the menu, which I came upon a unique omelet Ive never seen else were. CHILI CHEESE OMELET for BREAKFAST?!? Yup, as crazy as I may seem (EARLY IN THE MORNING) I choose that as a start off of a GREAT DAY AHEAD OF ME. Honestly, I could have counted to 200 and been notified that my food was ready.  Eating my CHILI CHEESE OMELET... it was FANTASTIC! It was made of egg (your normal egg omelet) which had green peppers inside and full of chili. DELICIOUS!  I highly recommend everyone to stop by and ask for the Chili Cheese Omelet early in the morning.  B+ 4 STARS",

They don't really smile at you or really acknowledge your there. All a sudden they just go \"come with me\".  Food: Not the greatest food either. It's not disgusting, but it's not anything special either.  Cinnamon Roll with Apples - It was okay, tasted like the ones you can get from the store.  Waffle with fruit - Not that great. It tasted bland and like this made it with water down batter. Meatball sliders - Better than other things I have tried. In my opinion there was too much meat and too little bread. The sauce was good though.  Chicken wings (mild) - Pretty good. It is serviced with ranch dressing which is probably why it tasted good. You can chose from mild, medium, or hot. But overall, I think this was the best thing from the list we ordered.   I wouldn't recommend this place, unless... 1. You are too lazy to to leave Luxor 2. Want something to eat and it's 2am-6am.",

The toast is brought to the table in a basket with everyone's selection.  Food was average.   Ok, if you are staying at the Luxor and don't feel like going far for breakfast.  My eggs were under cooked for my taste. I should have ordered them over medium so my whites would have been cooked more.  My steak was ordered medium rare but it came out medium well.  Flavor of the steak was good and it was tender.  The hash browns, had a crisp topping, but the inside was soggier than what I prefer.  The other dish ordered at my table was the corn beef hash and eggs.  It was a large portion of hash served and he said it was \"ok\". Food came out hot and fairly quickly.  The coffee server was quick with the coffee refills, otherwise service was slow.",

Dante & Pollard were awesome and very attentive. $50, 2 breakfasts, coffee, & 2 Bloody Mary's to chase the hang over. Will be back!!",

Because it was so late, there was no wait for a table and we were directed to a large table for our party.   I was craving carbs and protein, so decided to split the steak and eggs. Comes with a side of hash browns. The food was decent. Decent enough to curb my hunger and soak up the alcohol.  Our service was great. Very nice and accommodating.",

    "text": "The Pyramid Cafe should be considered an alternative for guests looking for something more than the meager offerings of the food court and Starbucks.  Located on the casino level of the Luxor, the menu offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner fares, for which I'm sure most will find something to their liking.  Although not extensive, the menu does have appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and desserts as well.  On this most recent visit, my cousins and I were looking more for snack versus an actual meal.  Altogether we ordered the classic caesar salad, quesadillas, onion rings, and buffalo hot wings.   All items were satisfactory and our hunger pains soon went the way of all the money I fed into the slot machines........gone and away.  SERVICE:  Quite good actually.  The server that helped us was an older female, but she had a very positive and enthusiastic attitude.  I appreciated the fact that she apologized for the lateness of our food because of a delay in the kitchen.  She also provided drink refills in a timely manner and checked up on us frequently to see how we were doing.  Bottom Line:  As a guest of the Luxor, I would recommend the convenience of the Pyramid Cafe.",

Bonus is that it isn't too expensive for strip food. Negatives are the long lines and the fact that they aren't open past lunch time. Honestly, if they were, this place would be packed 24/7.",

The hollandaise sauce was way too salty and the eggs had no salt at all. The bread wasn't toasted and it was cold.   My mom got the philly omelet which was actually decent but not an omelet more of a scramble. Her toast was just warmed bread, no actual crunch or anything. Again the potatoes are fried.  Our server, Jennifer, was very nice and actually noticed our dislike of the potatoes and swapped it with fruit also offered to let us try the grapefruit juice to see if we liked it before ordering. Overall she made it an endurable experience regardless I will not return.",

Saw other tables getting served milk for their kids so we knew they had it. This lady just didn't have the time. She even came by the refill my coffee and I again said we had been waiting a while and my daughter would like something to drink. She said ok, walked off. We wound up asking the guy who brought out our food and he was kind enough to go get it.   The service aside we were able to get a decent healthy breakfast at Vegas prices. Cha-ching! Hope you do well at the tables because it isnt really cheap. The place also filled up fast and their was a line waiting at the hostess stand. Speaking of the hostesses, they were awesome and SUPER friendly. I felt bad for them. They had a long line of guests and there were a bunch of tables with dirty dishes on them waiting to be cleaned up. Seemed a bit like management was out of order that weekend.",

It was about the size of my fist!  Regardless of its size, the skillet was actually pretty good.  The hash browns were crispy, and the cheese was nicely melted.  The bacon bits were mixed in really well.    A little bit pricey for what I ordered, but all in all, I would recommend this place to people staying at the Luxor.

The waitress came over shortly after and took our order, she was very pleasant.  Our food came very quickly.  We both got omelets and they were huge!  They came with a big helping of hash browns and 3 pieces of toast each.  We couldn't finish it all.  Everything was delicious.  The only bad thing I can say is the hash browns were a little too salty.  I felt the price was fair for what we received.",

    "text": "The Pyramid Cafe was our first dining experience in Vegas on our recent trip there. We woke up and wanted a breakfast/lunch style meal without the hassle of a buffet. We made our way through Excalibur and crossed over into Luxor and found Pyramid Cafe. I was put off to see that the sign by the entrance stated it was only open from 6am to 2pm. Vegas ought to have more 24 hr cafe-like operations. I was also unimpressed with the quality of the food compared to the prices. I ordered a prime rib sandwich and my wife ordered a common egg, sausage, hash brown, and toast plate. She was unimpressed with the quality of food also. My sandwich was very very bland. Almost no flavor to it. I needed to add salt and tried numerous other sauces to try to flavor it, but couldn't quite find the right combination. The service was decent. We had Mary Ellen as our waitress and she came high recommended by others on Yelp. Three stars for service, but missed out on 4 or 5 due to poor food quality and over-priced (even for Vegas).",

It is overpriced for what you get -- I  guess I was thinking that being Vegas it would be more reasonable.  Granted, I was thinking Denny's prices.  The salad was good, but very basic - a lot of lettuce, chicken, lettuce ... you get the picture..  The breakfast was good.   Our server had brought out the preservatives that I wanted (Raspberry) instead of telling me that it wasn't available - so yeah for that!",

    "text": "This place is always good for late night / early morning food that hits the spot!  After unsuccessfully searching around Bally's Casino area for a good eatery at 11:00pm, we decided to catch a quick cab to the Pyramid Cafe.  I have visited Pyramid Cafe close to 8 times; it has yet to disappoint.  Sure the waitstaff at midnight are not the most alert, but the food is worth the short wait...and even a long wait if it's crazy busy.  I always get the Magherita Pizza.  It's killer.  ONE time it was odd tasting - I'll chalk that up to a new chef in the kitchen not knowing the secrets of superb pizza.  Okay, maybe \"superb pizza\" is exaggerating it a bit.  Let's put it this way; after drinking all day long and realizing it is midnight and you haven't had anything to eat, this pizza is the BOMB!  It's even good on a sober stomach as well.  The crust has just the right amount of crunch.  The sauce is light and sweet.  The basil strips sprinkled on top really make the pizza.  And the tomatoes are sliced to perfection - nice and thin.  Seriously, I love this pizza.  I was even awesome as leftovers the next morning. My husband had the steak and eggs.  He's a meat and potatoes kinda guy.  And he was in love with his food while it lasted.  In fact, I got a little jealous.  I was being ignored whilst he was devouring the carnage of the steak and eggs.  Perfectly cooked steak, hashbrowns, and over medium eggs - according to him.  I'll have to take his word on it as I am not a meat and potatoes kinda gal. Go here when it's late and you're hungry.  You'll be full and smiling in no time.",

Could it be the service totally sucks but I don't care because its 24 hours and the prices are decent?  It could be, but for some reason I've remained a fan of the Pyramid Cafe through good times and bad.  Given the nature of many of Las Vegas' residents and visitors, more places should have more late night hours.  With a 24/7 joint like the Pyramid Cafe, the diner food becomes a reality but in a pyramid-themed corner of the Luxor.  Beware:  Their sandwiches are overpriced and so are the waitresses ... meaning they're being paid too much by the Luxor to deliver crap service.",

It was so hot that i almost dropped the entire teapot of hot water on my leg but i managed to put it down.    I was hungover and tired and trying to eat something before I catch my flight out so I didn't complain, I just wanted an icebag so I don't blister.  Now here's the bad service part....i had to ask another waitress to find our waitress, our waitress had to call the manager, the manager had to call security.  When he finally came, i said i just needed a bag of ice.  I should've just took it up with the drink server, told her that she filled up the pot to the absolute brim, and had her get me a bag of ice from the kitchen.  oh well.",

The food was about what you'd expect at a place like this and it was perfectly edible, but the prices were outrageous... I know it's Vegas, and I adjust my views accordingly.   It also had poor service. This wasn't our extremely harried waiter's fault -- he apparently had 16 tables to cover in the morning rush. This shouldn't have been a surprise onslaught. After checkout time, of course there's going to be a rush. But they had far too few waiters, and they had a long line form at the hostess table despite having a third of the restaurant empty.  Skip this place. Either just get a bagel at starbucks on your way out or stop somewhere on the road. Unless you're in our situation with a coupon, there's really no reason to go here.",

When it was served, my first thought was \"This is it?\" It wasn't very big, but tasted alright. The dried tomato in it was a nice touch. It's served with a choice of cole slaw, baked potato or fries. I had it with the fries which weren't oily. So that's a good thing.   I looked at what my friend's wife ordered and wished I ordered what she had which was the salmon. Again, it didn't look like much. Just a piece of fish on yellow rice. It did look like a good slice of fish. I can't remember what my friend ordered.   They also serve breakfast all day. I thought about ordering that, but since I was leaving the next day, I had planned on taking in a breakfast buffet in the morning.   Service wasn't very friendly. The lady who took our order had a pretty much \"Whaddya want\" type attitude. The intonation in her voice when she check on us made me afraid to ask for a refill on my drink.

What was I thinking ordering Ramen at a cafe. I've had better instant ramen from 7-11. Ramen was topped off with chicken breast, some green onions and carrots. CARROTS! yes CARROTS - It's totally wrong!. Broth tasted like it came from a Campbell can.   I'm giving it 2 stars because I only sampled the ramen. The SF-Club sandwich was (shrugs shoulder) so-so.

    "text": "This is the third time I've eaten at a 24 hour cafe in a Strip property in the last two weeks. This time, we ate here after going to the Barenaked Ladies concert at the Mandalay Bay Beach. Initially, we were going to do the Red White & Blue in Mandalay Bay, but I almost passed out at the prices and lack of veggie options. Having visited Pyramid Cafe once before when I first moved to Las Vegas, we decided to make the trek to the Luxor. Scanning the menu I was bombarded with options for vegetarians, from breakfast to entrees to apps, I had a lot of choices and wouldn't have to ask for a lot of substitutions. I ordered the nachos (holy crap it was a huge plate filled to the brim with beans, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream and guacamole), everyone else at the table had breakfast, and we shared onion rings. There would have been no way I could have finished the nachos. What I liked best about them is that the PC uses real cheese. I've had fake cheese on nachos plenty of times at other cafes, but there was at least two types of shredded cheese used to make this plate.  After having mediocre experiences at other cafe's, I will definitely hit this one up again...",

We order something that shouldn't be very hot, she drops the plate off and you wouldn't expect this plate to give you a burn bad enough for a blister, no warning and my son was burned.  3. I had to ask another waitress for items, she was great I handed her a tip also.  4. Food isn't all that great, this place just works at 2am for food...

    "text": "Since the Excalibur decided that having a cafe for breakfast was not a good idea we ventured into the Luxor and came across the Pyramid Cafe. Unfortunately they close after lunch time so they are not a 24 hour operation which is most unfortunate because the food they offer would be perfect for late night eats. No matter I guess at least they offered early morning breakfast. I forget the name of the dish I ordered but it was a basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and toast. The eggs and sausage were good but the hasbrowns and toast left something to be desired. I liked the decor of the place. The Luxor does a phenomenal job of staying True to their theme. The prices are typical Vegas, which is you pay more than you usually would for something, so I have different price expectations for them. My breakfast was around $9 and for Vegas that is pretty typical so it does not bother me. I expect t spend more money to dine out on vacation then I would at home especially at restaurants in Vegas casinos. There are cheaper dining options on the strip like a Dennys or Cocos so if I did not like these prices I could go elsewhere so I don't feel like I have the right to complain too much about that. The food here was nothing special but it was not disgusting either. Our waitress MaryEllen was a sweetheart and she had great customer service. She made sure we had everything we needed at all times. I ordered a milk and she forgot to bring it out to me and when I reminded her she was very apologetic and made up for it. To her defense the place was packed and she was working alot of tables. The food took a little long to come out but it was very busy that morning.  Overall the place is just basic. Nothing remarkable. I plan to stay at the Luxor on another trip to Vegas and when I do I would say I will eat here again I just think I will choose another selection for my meal.",

As for the flavor it wasn't as sweet as I like and seemed abit salty. Didn't get any flavor of an actual waffle.

Situated near the poker machines (no escaping them wherever you are in the casino) and seemed like a decent breakfast option that wasn't a buffet.  Service was lovely and I was quickly seated and my order taken. I went with The Benedict (two fresh poached eggs & canadian bacon served on an english muffin with hollandaise sauce & hash browns) and a Fresh Brewed Iced Tea. The benedict was lovely and nicely poached flowing yellow egg yolks. I noticed that American egg yolks are much more yellow than the traditional Australian orange egg yolks. It had a delicious flavour to the dish and even got a bonus mini orange muffin too. The tea was unsweetened so you can add as much sugar to it as you like.",

We also read the menu while we waited and decided on the spot we'd be back because everything looked very good. The restaurant was very clean and open, and even though there were many people there, it was quiet and intimate. Cool decor. Can't wait to go back and eat there! (And the Bloody Marys were divine!)",

The price is okay not overpriced nor cheap either but what do you expect something inside a casino? not cheap right. Overall the bill for 4 people breakfast/brunch was around 60 dollars.

They offer plenty of standard breakfast and lunch fare, but the standout dishes reside in their diverse selection of French toast. They don't just add different toppings to the same bread. They utilize different types to create the best profile.  Despite the lack of carrots in the carrot cake French toast, the bread was soaked through with custard and topped with garnishes that added a nice variety of tastes and textures to make it a standout dish. Likewise, the strawberry shortcake French toast was an enticing array of flavors highlighted by the strawberry compote. Lighter, overall, than the carrot cake, it was equally as good.  Less successful were red velvet pancakes that had a tough, almost rubbery texture and icing that was thick and grainy. However, the hints of caramel were a nice touch. Their monte cristo was a solid rendition with an exterior providing plenty of crunch. It could have benefited from more ham, but the flavors were still decent.  With a menu full of items that are more likely to satisfy than impress, it's the specialty items like the French toast that should be ordered for a memorable meal.  4 Stars",

Big mistake, because the chicken treats never stopped coming once we were inside Cathouse!  But at least our leisurely dinner was very enjoyable when we ate it.  French Onion Soup was rather weird looking with crispy onion straws strewn all over the soup's Swiss Cheese top.  But it all melted nicely and tasted hot, cheesy, very oniony, and satisfying as this comfort food should.  Red Skin-on Potato Salad was nice and cold, with pretty hard but tasty potato chunks, egg, celery, and green onions.  Creamy Cole Slaw with carrot slivers was very good, except not as cold as I would have preferred.    A very good and big Monte Cristo sandwich was the highlight of my meal.  I got both powdered sugar and Strawberry Sauce refills to keep the sandwich of hot ham, smoked turkey, and melted cheese sweet and well lubricated.  The divine sauce even contained ripe half strawberries in it.  Diane enjoyed her Fish & Chips, and caused me to chuckle as she began to dip her fries in the extra powdered sugar supplied on request.  Service was excellent and attentive, and included several unrequested Iced Tea refills.  This was a definite 4-1/2 star experience!",

Sandwich was good and fries were excellent, hot and crispy. My wife had the reuben, which was really good with plenty of corned beef (ratio with sauerkraut is very important). Sandwiches were 15 each. Coffee was drinkable, nothing special. Better coffee would have made this a 4-star review.",

They do put cold chopped tomatoes on top though with makes the nachos cold as a whole. My boyfriend got the burger, so large he didn't even touch his fries. I got the Monte Cristo sandwich.  OMG.

It was about 2 o'clock in the morning and there was a mix of people getting a late meal after checking in to the hotel and a few clubbers coming from LAX & Cathouse. Then there was us - my BF wanted to pull an all nighter and thought that getting something to eat would refuel us (and the 2 Monster energy drinks he bought earlier) - but it just wasn't going to happen!   I ordered the 3 Egg Denver Omelet and my BF ordered the following: their bacon, eggs, and rice (he wanted asian style sticky rice, but they only serve a rice pilaf); short stack, a side order of toast, and an extra side of bacon. I don't know who would want to stay up after eating all that!   The food was good and that 3 egg omelet was too much - 2 eggs would've been good! My BF really enjoyed his meal(s), but I don't think he ate all of it...   Service was slow - but our food came out in a timely manner, just waiting for our waitress to come around to take our order took about 10 minutes. The bathroom is separate from the restaurant - but the walk wasn't too far.   If I had to choose between Pyramid Cafe and any of the late night eateries in the Luxor (McDonald's, Nathan's) - I would go to Pyramid Cafe, but if other places were open - I would go there first!",

The Reuben was very big and delicious. I couldn't even finish the entire sandwich because they filled it with so much meat and sauerkraut. Most of the rest of my party had burgers and thought they were good as well.   We also stopped here the day before we left for a breakfast since everyone was sick of Mcdonalds. I got the All-American with bacon, hash browns, and toast. The eggs were cooked great as were the hash browns and toast but the bacon was so incredibly  overdone that I couldn't even try them. Again they had a good selection of breakfast options to choose from. Two of the other people I dined with got the pancakes and french toast which they enjoyed.   Service is really slow and it seems like the waiters forget about you after awhile. To me that would be the one thing that could improved greatly. Other then that this is a great spot for breakfast and lunch.",

The service response time was a bit slow one time I was visiting, but this is offset by the fact that this cafe is a far better choice than going to the Luxor Buffet.   As the wait times for the buffet can be substantially longer, I'm choosing to eat at the cafe out of convenience. The food is slightly better given that I can chose to have a Fresh Veggie Scramble Omelet, or fresh eggs prepared how I like them.   Considering the convenience of getting breakfast reasonably quick, for a crew to work at a tradeshow convention (or any outing), consider eating here first before eating at the buffet.",

It wasn't super crowded and my group wasn't really going to eat too much considering we planned on buffet-ing later in the day.  I wanted to get a small sandwich or something but the average entree price was over $12 with the exception of the soup and salad was $9.  The soup was good but the salad I got was miniscule.  I also got a half pound of dressing to go with my miniscule salad so that was quite comical.  Thank goodness my friend at the table used up the ranch with his fries.    If I had to choose again, I would've went with the deli as I didn't need to pay them a tip.  The night of the Rock and Roll Marathon, the line to get in there was HUGE since it was probably the only place that still was serving food past 10pm!  Not many options to choose from here since LV Blvd was still closed off past 11pm.  Not likely I'll be back here unless it was super way late in the middle of the night.",

    "text": "Nice little cafe with barely any wait. Its kind of hidden behind a curved wall, but no line is fine with me. Price was a little costly but which hotel restaurant usually isn't? So i guess it's average compared to many.  Ambiance: It's a simple cafe style place. Nothing fancy.  Service: This is meh. Some try so hard to put on a smile but you can so tell they don't want to be there at all. They look tired, bored and want to go home. They still try though.  Food: Not too bad. I mean, you can't really mess up on American breakfast as its quite easy to make. But they have lots of varieties and some items you can mix it up if you cant decide on one. Love that!! The table next to us got salmon lox with guacamole on the side and all. Will definitely go back. Especially when there is barely any line.",

    "text": "Terrible food with all the negative characteristics that suggests. We saw Pyramid Cafe had 2.5 stars but ultimately decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and try the breakfast because we were too lazy to walk anywhere else outside of Luxor. We ordered an omelet, the pyramid burger and eggs benedict. The \"hollandaise\" sauce they give you for the eggs benedict literally tastes like a bunch of butter mixed into something that I wouldn't even call a sauce, it was a runny yellow water as opposed to the creamy warm yellow most places offer and I ultimately steered clear of the sauce and asked for something else. I also found a piece of men's short hair in my food (we're all girls so it sure wasn't ours) and the manager was kind enough to remove the food from our bill. I got the pyramid burger because I was thinking well, it's a burger... and you can't really mess up a burger, but somehow they still did. There's no sauce whatsoever in the burger, the patty was burnt and dry. The omelet was huge, mostly egg. I mean I know omelets are made of eggs, but for $20 I would expect more veggies and a thin layer of egg all around. On a positive note, the service was great. Our cups were never empty and everyone was kind, but unfortunately we came here for the food. I know our next Vegas trip won't consist of pyramid cafe.",

One thing I've noticed is that they've remodeled this place and that they only serve breakfast and lunch no more dinner.  I remember that they used to be open 24 hours but was probably over a decade ago.   The service was great and so was the food!   The menu is simple and reasonably priced considering its on the strip. It's not like Downtown though, where you can find excellent deals for cheap...   We stayed at the Delano next door but made our way to the Luxor and we were glad we did. There are more dining options at Luxor and are more value priced compared to Delano or Mandalay Bay.   I'll surely be back again if in Vegas and on this side of the Strip.   Thanks for the excellent service and great tasting food!",

I ended up getting the club sandwich which was awesome. The food came out quickly and was perfect temp. It was all very good.  I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. But decided for a 4. The main reason was nothing was able and beyond but very good.  The breakfast was lackluster but the lunch was great. But basted off the price...you may be better off going to the buffet near by.",

Burger, omelette, fries basically a Denny's under a different name.  However, once I got my omelette, I must say it was much better than expected.  Still just an omelette but not a greasy mess that you might find at any other mid-rate resort hotel on or off the strip.  Prices are reasonable.

It's a decent option if you find yourself wandering around Luxor on the verge of starvation, but definitely not a place that you should seek out for any legitimate reason.  I had the fish and chips, which were quite greasy but not terrible.  The GF had the Monte Cristo, which was apparently inedible.  I can't say that that I was expecting much, so I wasn't disappointed.",

Moral of the story for us, after visiting is: the better hotels have a better breakfast spot.    Nothing spectacular, but if I were to stay in the Luxor, I would definitely hit  this place up and not really bother to venture out when I could get something pretty good for a reasonable price in a pinch.",

    "text": "It might not be King Tut worthy, but it got the job done for me! There aren't a huge number of dining options at Luxor, and as a result I landed here. It is bright, spacious and clean, which is always a nice start to a meal. The menu has something for everyone I'm pretty sure; the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable. My choice: a simple soup and salad combo. The salad was mixed greens with basic vegetables, and the blue cheese dressing was just right. The tomato soup wasn't mind-blowing. It was a close relative to Campbell's. Nothing to be ashamed about. The only thing I truly missed was a basket of warm bread. Otherwise, an acceptable choice for when you're hungry, not looking for anything too fancy and you happen to be at the Luxor.",

Saturday around noon, which I assume is one of the busiest times at a casino cafe, there seemed to only be four servers - all who seemed overwhelmed by the volume of patrons. The food was pretty good. Hubby and I split the artichoke spinach dip and a chicken caesar sandwich. The dip was really good and garlicky. The sandwich, while it didn't look all that appetizing, was really tasty. It was served on foccacia with a big slice of swiss. Took three tries to get an iced tea. Definitely go before you are in the omg-i-need-to-eat-right-now hunger zone.",

I would like to give it a higher rating but they seem to under staff the place. You have to wait to be seated and half the place is empty.

I never got my toast and our drinks were never refilled.  It took over 30 minutes to get our check and our change.

    "text": "We stayed at The Luxor (mistake #1) and found this place to be the only restaurant in the hotel to get some eggs and bacon (to order) to clear up the hangover.  We went twice while we were in Vegas.  Here's why it sucked:  1)  The line is so so long even though more than half the tables were completely open.  They just refused to sit us. 2)  The service is TERRIBLE.  When I asked for waters the waitress rolled her eyes at me and disappeared for ten minutes. 3)  Poached eggs came in a small dish on the side, swimming in water.  While blotting the eggs on a napkin, my yolk broke.  That just sucks. 4)  We ordered turkey sausage and they brought greasy pork sausage.  When I pointed that out, the waitress told me we were wrong and that it was obviously turkey.  No. Pork. 5)  Underseasoned and bland hash browns.    What's good:  1)  Uhm... bacon.  Bacon is always good.  For what this place charges and for it being the only real breakfast spot in the hotel, I wished for a lot more.  Thankfully, I'll never step foot into the Luxor again after our experience which means I'll never have to eat at the Pyramid Cafe again.",

The waitress was over touchy with our husbands as well and my husband actually noticed this which means it was excessive because he never notices when a girl is flirting with him lol.

When we were seated, our drink order was taken right away, but we waited about 15 minutes for a server to come over.  It wasn't all that busy, but there were only 2-3 servers on duty and a schmuck of a manager strolled around not helping very much.  He should have taken off his jacket and got his hands dirty.    I ordered onion soup and M had pizza.  The food tasted okay, not bad, but not great.  It definitely wasn't worth the wait.  The food was overpriced (ya, I know, it's Vegas).

It was sort of last minute at 9pm so we settled. Even at 9pm the place was busy and we had to wait for a table.  When we sat down it took a while for a server to get to us. Everyone working there looked harried, stressed and overworked. When we finally got served our server was very nice and did the best she could to get around to us. Ironically there were several men standing around who looked like managers who werent doing much at all to assist the staff even though they clearly needed it. Also, I saw a server loudly complaining about a customer to the manager within earshot and sight of the entire dining area. This is such a pet peeve of mine.  The food was just ok. We ordered a Cobb salad and salmon burger. The Cobb salad was pretty boring and predictable. The salmon burger was alright, maybe slightly undercooked, pretty small and not terribly interested.   If I had to do it all over again I would make the extra effort to find another place to eat. Our total bill came to around $28 which certainly wasnt worth what we ate.",

I would've hugged him if he brought out a frozen t-bone & slapped Queen drama next door. Just kidding...I'm not violent but pretty imaginative though  not in that \"Saw\" movie kind of way  The only thing is that the lines were way too long which is great because that means that people loved the food served here but I saw a couple of empty tables on the side while we were waiting. Tipsy, hungry & TIRED are the worse combination and that's nuff said while breaking into new 5 inch heels especially when you see empty tables set up & ready.  Overall, this was the place to find comfort food such as my delicious Vegetarian omelet, a huge mix of fresh spinach, tomatoes & mushrooms with fluffy white & yellow eggs, wheat toast, side of fresh fruit & the sweetest yet strong coffee. Yum!  Ending this review now because I am stuffed from this hearty meal and ready to zzzzzzzz  Wake me at 12 noon...ahhh Vegas",

Came here for brunch Saturday, ordered the tuna salad sandwich (not something I typically order at a restaurant ever) but something was telling me to order it....and I am so glad I did.  It was the most amazing tuna salad I have ever had.  I also got the coleslaw for a side and that too was delicious.  I also had a bite of my friends fish and chips....just as tasty!  Everyone at the table was beyond please with their dishes, so in the future I will definitely make my way over to this nice cafe.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the service....granted it was Saturday near lunch hour....but no personality whatsoever...came and ran (literally, so he was hustling)...but breath, slow down a minute and enjoy your friendly customers.",

I suggest the other restaurants in Luxor or the food court. Not worth trying this place at all, maybe the lunch is better but as far as the breakfast goes.... don't bother.

This place served the worst breakfast I have ever had. My husband and I ordered omelets served with hash browns. The omelets were cold and the topping were laying on top rather than mixed inside the eggs. Spinach was not chopped but rather just a few leaves laying on top. The eggs were unlike the texture or taste of real eggs instead they were the kind served in school cafeterias, egg beaters, perhaps? The hash browns were standard undercooked from a bag with no flavor. This meal with nothing extra was going to cost over $40.00!! I could not manage to choke down this meal so I told the waitress how unsatisfied I was and she deducted the price of one of our meals. Denny's McDonald's Starbucks any of these restaurants would have been better for far less.Don't even go here out of convenience! There are too many other options in Las Vegas.",

We are back in Vegas after 5 years to reprise our honeymoon and also get away pending the birth of our 2nd baby girl   The food and service and ambiance are still excellent. The coffee was much better than Starbucks (which are EVERYWHERE on the strip and come on the coffee just isn't that great), and I got the Croissan' wich. The eggs are nice and fluffy, the croissant buttery, the fried potatoes are heaven. The only possible upgrade would have been cheddar cheese instead of American but oh well. Husband, who loves chicken and waffles, had just that and declared it the best chicken and waffles he's ever had!  (Unfortunately I learned definitively that daughter #2 does not like eggs. Boo!)  10/10, definitely recommend!",

Every item is scratch made, with extremely quality ingredients. If our current president was writing this review he would say \"their stuff is great, they have great stuff, they have the greatest stuff, stuff that no one else has stuff\". The portions are huge, a stack of flapjacks is seven dollars but it is actually two giant pancakes. One pancake is enough and that dish is easily shareable. My favorite dish I had there was the parfait, it is homemade granola with nuts that have been beautifully roasted to where they are soft but still retain some crunch, there are berries that are freshly dried and still a little bit tender and juicy with burst of flavor, it's layered with Greek yogurt, fresh berries and topped with a big chunk of honeycomb. My husband's favorite was the breakfast burrito, it has chicken, sausage, chorizo, cheese, eggs and comes with a beautiful spicy molcajete salsa. There are plenty of choices in Vegas for where you can eat but if you want to quality meal, for a fair price, that is going to stuff you for the entire day while you're walking 10 miles through casinos I definitely recommend eating here.",

There was a lot of chicken and maybe this was slightly healthier than a canned soup? The sandwich was way too bready and by the end of the meal, I was eating just the filling (turkey was very salty but the bacon was thick!).

I like Denny's and the workers just seemed one level below there.  The prices were low and food was really tasty, but nothing over the top fabulous. I also had one Mojito which was also very tasty and had a stick of sugar cane in it to chew on, yum! That was the icing on the cake.",

    "text": "While this is just your standard hotel cafe, this place fails on all counts.  Over the years I have stayed at the Luxor a lot, and every time it always seems to be the same problem, and the only reason this place continues to get my business is because when I eat there I am normally hung over and don't want to mess with anything else.  I have only ever ate here for breakfast, but the food is always consistently pretty bad, and the service is always pretty terrible.  This last trip I got an omelet that was smothered with way to much cheese, and for being a steak omelet, it has about 3 small pieces of steak inside, that tastes like it was microwaved.  I got some toast with my omelet and it tasted like it was 10 days past its prime, and I couldn't even eat it.  The servers always seem to be rude here, and are in no hurry to take your order, and in even less of a hurry to bring it out to you.  Does everyone at the table want their food brought out at the same time?  Better not hold your breath, that is another thing they aren't in a hurry to do either.",

The person who attended us and ask what drinks we would like was very nice and quick and always checked up on us to see if we needed more drinks. Now on the other hand out waiter was awful!!! Like literally awful!!! It took him 1 hour and 20 minutes to bring out our food and he brought out everyone's food out at the same time and he didn't know who's food was what. He brought the wrong food for the wrong people. He kept dropping stuff on the floor and spilling people's drinks, sweating excessively, shaking, pacing back and forth!!!! I mean it was awful!! I feel bad for him but I don't know what was wrong and a few minutes later I saw him being escorted out but authorities!!!!! Awful experience!!! My friend left to eat somewhere else. Everyone was complaining!!! Avoid this place!!!! Manager was very nice and gave us a refund!!! Thanks to her!!!!",

It seems as though they had some extra space and the Pharaoh at Luxor said \"Ah...well let's just put a crappy cafe and charge prices that are too expensive and maybe people will think it is trendy.\"  The result is that it becomes a tourist trap.  Do not go here.    I got pancakes...you wouldn't think they can mess up pancakes...well the Pyramid succeeded.  It was as if the pancakes were made by a 3 year old, and that 3 year old had no arms, no kitchen supplies, no burner (I swear they cooked them on a radiator), and the 3 year old had a grudge against me. It is as though they wanted me to have a horrible experience...like the chef gets a bonus if people hate his food.  \"No!  Don't use sugar in the pancake mix...use MSG...that will make it taste nasty...we don't want these people liking this food...how horrible would that be?\"  Seriously...the pancakes tasted salty as though somebody mixed up the sugar and salt.  How cliche is that?",

The Pyramid Cafe is open 24 hours and looked appealing with its half circle banquettes and view of the bustling casino.  I ordered a favorite I hadn't had in years, a Monte Cristo ($11.95) sandwich.  It was served with ample amounts of ham, turkey and cheese and cooked to the proper golden brown along with a very nice strawberry preserve.  The sandwich was good, but the French toast could have been better.    My wife had the California Turkey Panini topped with cheese, avocado and tomato ($11.95) served on a ciabatta roll.  Tasty enough but not pressed or grilled in any manner.  Huh, what's up with that?  We saw another patron get served the same thing and watched the quizzical look on his face as he lifted the top of the uncooked roll.     Is the \"press\" in the kitchen on the fritz or the executive chef doesn't know that most people expect a grilled Panini when that word (we're not in Italy) is used.   Now that I think about it, how can you press a sandwich with tomato and avocado on it?   Maybe they should rename it the warm Pyramid Cafe turkey sandwich.   Next time I'll go with the all day breakfast.",

There aren't really walls, so it does give you a view of weary, ragged-around-the-edges folks mindlessly working the slots at 3 am.  There's a fairly broad menu ranging from burgers to 24 hour breakfast. Out of sheer convenience, I ate here twice; once a breakfast type meal and the other dinner. Although different foods, the experience was similar.  Both times service was pretty slow, even when the place was only partly full and the number of patrons barely outnumbered the servers. Breakfast came with a nice helping of ham but runny eggs and wilted hash browns. A burger for dinner was okay; I rather liked the fries that came with it, but it was a pretty small helping. Prices had the expected resort markup.  I give two stars here, not that it's a particularly bad place, but it just seems to do everything a little below average. There's nothing egregious here and I'd eat here again in the right circumstances, but everything is sort of a C-/D+ level. I'd say that this is best for a basic meal if you're in the Luxor area or for a 4 am chowdown after a night on the town.",

There's no choice of milks either.   We ordered the mimosas which was great but you can't feel the effects. A pitcher is $25. When ordering food we both got the platters. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese. They forgot the cheese, brought it into the back where I assumed they were remaking the eggs..however it came back lukewarm with a mountain of powdered cheese on top of it. I ordered sausage and received bacon, again no apologies.   We then asked for the check, it took over 10 minutes with multiple reminders. Btw it wasn't busy. Again no apologies. But he remembered to tell us he took off the bacon we never asked for. $67 and it wasn't even worth half of that.  Please just avoid this place and go up the buffets",

We got there around 8am and it wasn't busy- so we were seated quickly and served quickly. I ordered veggie omelette with American cheese while my hubby ordered ham omelette and we got waffle on the side to share.   We only came here because we had $50 voucher and we were running out of time before we had to leave to go back to Seattle so this place was the first restaurant we saw.  Anyways omelette and waffle arrived. Waffle didn't have any whip cream which I was a little disappointed but that's fine- that's what we ordered. The omelette was really thick and there was barely any cheese inside the omelette. To my dismay the cheese was the processed cheese that you get at stores where they're individually wrapped. I was hoping for some real cheese. Also the omelette was very thick. At this point, Denny's or IHOP is better than this place.  The staff were very friendly though. The food wasn't good at all. I recommend going to Denny's or IHOP if you want better food. Otherwise the place was pretty clean.",

I ate breakfast here yesterday morning because the picture looked really, really good. We got here pretty early and thanks to half of Las Vegas still sleeping we got seated and served very quickly. The hostess and are waitress were both super nice, helpful, and attentive throughout our stay. The breakfast menu is pretty much a standard menu with a few unique twists on things, like my pancakes being the \"pyramid pancakes\" which was basically a stack of pancakes shaped like a pyramid (which was actually just way too many pancakes). The taste? Amazing! The pancakes tasted absolutely delicious and pouring syrup on a pyramid of pancakes was very satisfying for some reason, you should probably try it as well.   Overall, my first Las Vegas breakfast was a darn good one. Both the service, environment, and food were great and it's definitely solid breakfast spot if you are staying at the Luxor.",

It was actually good.  The hollandaise sauce is always either a hit or miss.  For this restaurant, the hollandaise sauce was a hit.  However, the hash browns was a little over cooked.    The hubs got the stacked pancakes and said he should have gotten short stack.  When it says stacked, they weren't kidding!    My family got turkey sandwich and croissant sandwich.  My cousin said his sandwich was good. My aunt said the croissant sandwich wasn't too bad.   If you're staying at Luxor, do stop by at this place. Although, like any resort, the price is pretty pricey!   And it is ON the strip!  If you want something more affordable, go off strip :)  Happy pyramiding!",

We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. Drinks came, but no waitress to take our orders. We waited about 10 minutes and when she finally did arrive at our table, she wasn't very friendly. She took our order and went on her way.   Our food arrived and it looked great! The eggs were poached perfectly and still runny...just they way it should be! Most places always over cook the eggs on eggs Benedict. It actually was one of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had and I've had a lot! The hollandaise was perfect! Even the hash browns were delicious and cooked with just the right amount of crispiness. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, so compliments to the chef!   The service could have been way better though. We waited too long for our waitress. She noticed we were done eating and came to clear our plates but disappeared for another 15 minutes before she came back to check on us. We were ready for our check and to be on our way!",

I definitely read reviews and view pictures before choosing a place but considering it's hot as hell to go search for a breakfast place in Vegas and this was inside of the Luxor, I said why not! The location is on the 1st floor near the slot machines so you can't miss it. At first glance the place looks cute and clean, the waitresses were really nice upon greeting and the service was overall great. I came here twice for breakfast on my trip and I have zero complaints about the service.  The first day I had breakfast here I had the Croissant Wich with egg whites. Although the sandwich itself was delicious, it was on the oily side. I had to dab it with a napkin, they give you loads of bacon on it...so much bacon I had to remove some of it (too much for my liking). Now, the cubed potatoes they serve with this dish are dynamite! I loved them!   The second day I was here I had the 3-Way Avocado Toast and as an avocado lover I was super happy! The toast was warm and not too toasty, the avocado was flavorful and delicious, and the toppings were great! I took ate most of the olive topping toast (hence the missing third toast in the picture). For a diner, their coffee was really good! Warm and bold. Make sure you ask for flavored creamer, if you're into that!   Overall this place is great, a bit pricey but it is about two steps above a Denny's for me. I recommend this place won't hurt to try, especially if you're staying at the Luxor. Place closes at 2 by the way!",

Well I was wrong, their way of seating, to the food and service was great. We sat down and one of the host took our drinks immediately. Shortly after our server came who was a nice gentleman who had outstanding service etiquette. I ordered the pyramid combo and my husband had the country fried steak and eggs. Everything was cooked perfectly even down to the toast which I must say was amazing. It wasn't out of the bag toast it was our of the oven toast. Yum. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good breakfast. We spent less than $50 including tip.",

He asked whether there were traditional Egyptian beans served at breakfast. As much as I would have loved an authentic Egyptian breakfast, this cafe is a cheaper alternative to eating at the buffet, especially for breakfast.  My friend and I headed over to this cafe for breakfast. It was busy, but there were plenty of tables for us when we got there.  I love corned beef hash. I got it with hashbrowns and scrambled eggs.  The food was hot and good. I am not crazy about crispy hashbrowns to the point where they can injure you if you threw them at someone. I'm not saying that you would, but they were too hard for my liking.   Service was fine for how busy it gets. If you are in a rush, it's probably not the place for you. Otherwise, come here for a typical North American breakfast.  (171)",

I chose turkey sausage as a healthier alternative, but I didn't know that would include giving me a smaller portion than the pork sausages come as.

Up for a convenient meal that was not going to cost a fortune, we tried the Pyramid Cafe.   I expected mediocre food with sketchy service. On the contrary, the Pyramid Cafe classic cheeseburger was thick and juicy. The fries were tasty. The waitress was on top of beverage refills.    Although the Pyramid Cafe exceeded my expectations, I am still not a fan. A major reason is that I could get better value at off strip casino cafes. Or Denny's. I did not see salad or soup offered with the entres. For a Strip casino cafe, the prices are not outrageous. It is my understanding that the Pyramid Cafe is the least expensive casino cafe on the South Strip [south of Paris]. Fries are included in the price of the sandwich.     Pyramid Cafe is a good casino cafe that exceeded my expectations. Knowing that there are better casino cafe values in Las Vegas, I am not a fan.",

    "text": "Great to have a 24 hour cafe to go to in Vegas...   Staff was very friendly and attentive. I wanted something basic, just a ham and cheese sandwich but couldn't find it on the menu. The waitress tells me they do offer it and would place my order right away. So nice of her!!! Anyone else could have just ignored my and wait until I ordered from what was being ordered at that time in the menu. Not only did I get my sandwich but it was really good and portion made for two, and not expensive.   Two \"nights\" later, we were there again. Another friendly waiter, this time my friend and I shared a burger - he even split it for us, and we each got our share of fries.   Yes good food is obviously important, and they do have it, but good service is also a must to make us \"fans\".",

The 'crumpets' weren't your standard english muffin, which was nice. The hashbrowns weren't crunchy enough, but still decent.  The Husband got pancakes and a side order of sausage. The pancakes were great. The sausage, however, was disgusting. Really soft and soggy with a gross flavor.   And now said Husband is sick and bed-ridden on our honeymoon, and that sausage is the suspected culprit.   Needless to say, we won't be back.",

    "text": "They say you don't know what you've got till it's gone...how True about the Pyramid Cafe... For as many years as I can remember, I've made it a point to eat at least one meal at the Pyramid Cafe at the Luxor.  The fact that it WAS open 24 hours a day, plus they had some delicious food (the Monte Cristo was excellent, and loved their Halibut Fish & Chips).    However, I just got back from a business trip in Vegas and stayed at the Luxor.  Signs on the Pyramid Cafe anounced that they were only open for breakfast, closed at 11am.  I'm honestly shocked and disapponted by the new hours, one less 24 hour dining option that had way better food than Denny's or any fast food joints.  I'm just hoping this was a temporary/seasonal thing, being that I was in Vegas during the \"off season\".  I really missed the Pyramid Cafe this time, would've loved to eat there again, but couldn't make it there during their new, limited hours.  Please go back to 24/7!!!  I want my Monte Cristo and Halibut Fish and Chips!",

    "text": "This has got to be the worse place I've ever experienced in Vegas.  While walking around on our last day, a friend and I dropped in here for a late lunch at about 2pm. Just cause we wanted to eat some where relaxing and quiet. We got seated in a waiter's section that I guess was almost ready to leave and we were his last table.  When he finally came to take our order, it was the last we saw of him.  I had a coffee and a hamburger with onion rings.  After 15 minutes, our waiter had morphed into a waitress from another section who said our meals were coming right up as she ran by.  My coffee was empty so when she ran by, I asked for more and she yelled to another guy to come fill it.  He did...with coffee that was between luke warm and warm. After about 25 minutes after ordering our new waitress showed up with the food, slapped the plates down and took off before I could ask for mustard.  When I finally got the hostess' attention and asked for it, she delivered it to the the table next to us where they were just getting up to leave.  My onion rings were soggy and greasy. The onion and the lettuce on the burger was dried out as was the pickle on the plate. All was set aside on my plate never to be touched.  The hamburger itself was ok tasting and my friends NY steak and eggs was good too.  My coffee cost more than I pay for at Starbucks for a grande cafe mocha.  We only saw our waitress one more time after that and it was a drive by to tell us everything was ok instead of asking us if everything was ok.  Yeah...Our tip reflected the service we got.  Though I thought we were overly nice to give her enough to be able to play 3 times on a quarter machine.",

A whole one is $8 (I almost sharted when he told me that) $5 breakfast booze beverages like mimosa's and bloody mary's -- can't beat that..

Sprawling in size and comfortably spaced with a menu chock-a-block full of clever twists on breakfast favorites both sweet and savory it was to the pleasant service of a woman named Debbie that we were greeted and with the meal divided into two courses comprised of five items, including one from the mid-day menu, plus copious refills of coffee rarely would any part of the experience falter - a ninety minute visit tallying $65 all-in for one of the Strip's more innovative breakfasts.  Starting slightly savory before progressing to things far sweeter it was with the duo of three thin Red Velvet pancakes gussied up by tangy cream cheese icing and a custardy masterpiece of a Monte Cristo with fresh strawberry preserves that the meal began and although biscuits and hash browns proved somewhat uninspired as optional sides portions of each proved ample for the price.  Opting next to explore the section entitled \"French Toast and Waffles\" with a pair of the former the plates that arrived would prove even more impressive than round one; both \"breads\" actually sliced cakes dipped in custard and griddled golden, the carrot lacking much vegetable but rich with spice while the tangy poppy seed version served as base to the unbridled flavor of fresh strawberries in a dessert-come-breakfast take on a summertime favorite that should not be missed.",

    "text": "This is what I get for being lazy.  I know there are plenty of good places to eat after hours in Las Vegas, but I decided to dine here after watching Carrot Top's show simply because I was too lazy to go find something better.  The 24 hour Pyramid Cafe located on the casino floor of the Luxor was quite the popular spot when I was there as there was a constant line of patrons waiting to be seated.  I liken the restaurant to a Denny's based on its menu.  They serve items such as all-day breakfasts, salads, burgers and sandwiches and a few main dishes.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is all pretty friendly even though I noticed quite a few of the buspersons lagging in their step and just standing around and doing nothing while there were multiple tables to be cleaned off and countless patrons waiting for a spot to sit down.  After a ten minute wait I was seated.  I'm not complaining, but they sat me (dining solo) in a table for four while tables for two were available forcing groups of three or four to continue to wait for a table.  The whole seating arrangement just seemed way out of whack.  I got a nice waitress though who constantly smiled and checked up on me multiple times.  I ordered the New York Steak dinner and asked that it be cooked medium.  The dinner is served with fresh seasonal vegetables which turned out to be steamed carrots and broccoli and a choice of potato.  I chose mashed potatoes and made the mistake of saying yes to gravy.  The wait for the food was about as prolonged as the seating process.  In the meantime I was brought a basket with two warm garlic rolls and four pats of butter served cold and hard.  The bread (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=Ji_LeplLxwpK_0wCAN9n6g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Zosr...</a>) was flavorful, but it was not fresh as the center was kind of firm instead of being soft.  My steak dinner (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=xVshpLhrKF23IUVFmNqt2g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Zosr...</a>) didn't fare any better.  The meat was unevenly cooked as half of the steak was served medium-well and the other half was well-done.  I hate well-done steaks!  I wouldn't have minded had the entire steak was medium-well since that part remained tender and juicy.  Trying to cut into the well-done meat with only a semi-sharp steak knife proved to be a task as the entire table shook.  The huge serving of mashed potatoes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=bOshUN8Fs5iGod0KBTGG1Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Zosr...</a>) might have been okay had it not been drowned in the super salty brown gravy.  The best part of my meal ended up being the steamed broccoli.  Pyramid Cafe, no thanks!  Next time I won't be so lazy!",

    "text": "Went here with our $35 room credit to Pyramid Cafe, Tender Steakhouse, Rice Company, or the MORE Buffet. I didn't want the buffet because I knew I'd over eat and neither did my aunt. We decided on this place around 11 AM.  The line was long, but my aunt, mother, and father were already waiting at our table. My brother and I arrived about 11, but my sister and her fiance were late! COME ON SISSY!!!  Anyway, the service was horrendous. Lizzy came with water and I had arrived with coffee in my cup which was nice (since my mom knew I'd have some). Had to ask for refills of water and coffee.  We had a huge order and I got the angus steak, eggs, and cottage cheese. I was supposed to get rye bread (didn't) and fruit (being healthy) gets an upcharge/can't be subbed. Why, why Las Vegas do you fault me for wanting more fiber, less simple sugar, and more nutrients? I don't get you!  Thank goodness for the room credit. Wouldn't have gone if I didn't have it!",

In general this restaurant can be compared to a Denny's or Bob Evans but a bit worse. The waitress wasn't great; however, her busser was amazing. This is a below average restaurant with below average food. My plate was a little overpriced for how buttery my eggs were (drenched in butter and oil) and how soggy the hash browns were. My boyfriend's steak and eggs looked appetizing but didn't exactly hit the mark. In my opinion the restaurant is overpriced, poorly decorated, slowly falling apart and prepares below average food.",

Still, for $13.99 (which was about $7 too much), I was able to wolf down scrambled eggs, a heaping mound of bacon, hash browns, and a small stack of silver dollar pancakes. Made for a nice hearty breakfast. Quality would be comparable to Denny's, maybe slightly better.   You eat here for the convenience of not having to slog out down The Strip looking for somewhere to grub after a long night of enjoying Vegas. In that respect, it's your best bet if you happen to be staying here.   We didn't imbibe, but they've got $5 Bloody Mary's and mimosas. Great deal if you need a little hair of the dog to get your ass moving.",

My breakfast combo came with dried up disgusting sausage, POWDERED \"eggs\" and a tough and chewy pancake. How in the world do you make a pancake with a leathery texture? My suspicion is that these items were pulled off the buffet- it all tasted like it had been sitting out for a couple of hours. At least someone enjoyed it. The flies that joined us towards the end of the experience ate plenty. What's more, for an apple juice, two \"specials\" and a water the bill came to $40. There's too much good food in Vegas to waste a meal on garbage like this- even if you're in a hurry.",

The tables aren't too close together, so it's not extremely distracting or anything with noise or people.   But our waitress was very frank and not attentive at all. She put in our orders and drinks then never came back. Empty glasses, empty plates, just completely ignored.

My main concern was that 1/3 through my meal (an early weekday breakfast), my meal was interrupted by a violently-angry screaming match between a man and a woman in the kitchen / back area. I was wearing my headphones and watching a movie on my iPad and it was loud enough that I was pulled away from my show and meal and honestly quite startled. Other customers were also quite alarmed and very uncomfortable, and I (along with several others) left as quickly as I could.",

I wanted food cooked to order for me.  My food came out really fast.  I would be real surprised if any of it did not come from a warming tray.  The eggs were watery, the corned beef hash was dried out, I could only deal with part of the potatoes, the toast served wrapped in a basket was too cold even when it first got there to melt the butter.  The orange juice was really good and the decaf was ok.    The service was good and friendly.  The chairs were comfortable to lounge back in but not very comfortable to sit up to the table in.  Overall I was not really impressed paying $5 more plus tip for the same quality of food I could have gotten from the buffet.",

We should've walked further!  We've already knew we're in for a bad day when we were sat right at the entrance.  We asked for something inside (it was pretty quiet in the inside), but was told it's full.  We looked at the menu and all 6 guys ordered the prime rib ($19).  I figured, what the hell since I wasn't paying for it (one of the guys hit an $1800 jackpot before we arrived and buying dinner).  I order medium cook.  When the rib arrived, it was cooked completely through making the rib tough.  service was pretty slow, except when giving the bill (They were QUICK!)  Next time, I would rather eat Exalibur's Dogfood buffett than come here.  (Don't get me wrong, Exalibur's Dogfood buffett isn't cheap either.  It's running for $17!!!!.....probably McDonald would be the best option!",

She said they aren't drunk (though the table was filled with empty bottles of beer and other alcohol containers. The menu is just ok and the prices are HIGH for what you get.
