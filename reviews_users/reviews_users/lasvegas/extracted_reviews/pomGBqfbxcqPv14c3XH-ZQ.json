My husband ordered a lunch which included \"cheesy potatoes\"..which was TWO thin slices of potatoe with cheese on top, so I guess that counts lol.  I ordered the chicken enchilada with a green sauce and it was just okay.  I also had a cup of albondigas soup which was disappointing as it was a tomato base with three meatballs in it and no vegetables, I didn't care for it.",

However, after our most recent visit my wife and I are giving up. It's just too frustrating to pay hard earned money to someone else for bad food you could cook better yourself. The meat in our tacos, both carne asada and al pastor, was tastless, dry and tough to chew...a failure on the kitchen staff's part to execute the most basic and critical aspects of cooking.  Result: a ruined dining experience. Never again.",

The service was a little slow, but we definitely come here for the excellent food. We had to ask a couple times to refill our waters or grab a box for our leftovers. However, each dish was amazing. I ordered two shrimp tacos. They had a creamy chipotle sauce on them that made it delish!! My father ordered the queso tacos & said they were absolutely great! For appetizers, we tried the shrimp ceviche and elote de creme. The corn was absolutely amazing. A critique for the ceviche would be maybe a little more spice or lime.. it just seemed like it was missing something. The price is a little higher than most places around this area. But if you're looking for great Mexican food, this place does not fall short!!",

Last night we went and the hostess told us it'd be an hour wait unless we want to sit in the building adjacent to the restaurant.  We figured why not? It's right next to the restaurant and it's set up like a karaoke bar.  Could be fun, right? WRONG.  I don't recommend eating in their special little room unless you're there for the karaoke.  The service is not the same as in the main restaurant area.  It took almost 2.5 hours to eat dinner.  I was miserable.  We were forgotten about for long stretches. Had to ask for things three or four times.  Every other time I've been there I was brought chips, a green salsa, a brown salsa, and bean dip.  No bean dip last night.  And three empty baskets of chips for 14 people. Cups sitting empty. Waitress made no effort to remember who ordered what so when the food was delivered she was just holding it and shouting what it was and you had to speak up if it was your's.  I got the quesa tacos and they were bad.  The shrimp were missing from them and they were dripping grease and the cheese was burnt. Waitress completely forgot my cup of fideo soup and about 10 minutes after I reminded her about it she brought out a stone-cold BOWL of fideo soup.  I just pushed it away.  Luckily she took it off the bill without me even asking.  I guess she could tell I was less than thrilled.   I really hope I don't have to go here ever again.",

With open tables everywhere, they said the same thing they always say, \"sir, that'll be a 15 minute wait\" This has happened to us at least 6 times, but somehow we keep giving them a chance. Maybe its time to look around. Folks, if you're interested in a wait for a restaurant that's not busy and blatantly treats the customers to waiting while you stare at lots of empty tables, then this is the place for you. If you're not interested in long waits for no reason, there are lots of other options close by; for example try the place next to Red Robin or if Italian would fit, go across the street to Streets of New York.",

The first time I came here I wasn't sure if I'd like the food and plus it was a Friday night, at least the wait wasn't too long (about 20 min) and hey it was happy hour.   When we sat down, the server approached us and introduced herself and took our drink orders. I wasn't too sure what to try because they all seemed delicious. I ended up ordering the Ribeye Tacos...YUM! My cousin ordered the tamales and I had a little sample...totally worth trying.  The second time I came here I tried the Quesa Tacos because the server said it was one of the best items on the menu and I wouldn't be let down. He was right!! I ordered the Quesa Tacos with carne asada with a side of queso rice; I totally recommend trying it and trust me you can probably share because the tacos are pretty filling and the rice is amazing.   The third time I came here I tried the shrimp tacos (grilled), yeah I don't recommend it at all just because it was salty and just not that great. However, my cousin ordered the Empanadas and had a little bite of it and it was really good.   BTW if you check if you get a free fried ice cream, so make sure you check in and show your server because dessert is a perfect way to end your meal.",

The flautas remind me of the ones I had as a kid in San Diego. The house margarita was better than a lot of speciality drinks at other joints. On weekends the place gets a bit busy but I think that is a good thing. I know I'll be coming back a lot.",

We only wanted a Pepsi and a water. Not a hard task. We finally got our drinks around 30 minutes later. The table next to us ordered guacamole chip dip. And I overheard the customer say it was also 30 minutes! For chip dip!? We finally got our food. And that was great! My recommendation is to go to the bar and eat there. The service was excellent the last time I sat at the bar.",

I have never actually ate AT the restaurant but have gotten carry out from them a few times. The quesa tacos are AMAZING. You can get them with flour tortillas or corn. I have tried both and personally prefer the flour but I'm not a big fan or corn tortillas to begin with. My husband has had their street tacos and the enchiladas. He seems to always go back and forth between the two. The rice with the quesa tacos is a white rice with some sort of cheese.... AMAZING. The other dishes come with the regular Spanish rice which my husband loves. The place is usually PACKED on weekends and most evenings. I recommend the carry out if you don't want to wait. The atmosphere is very charming as well. Will definitely be returning here often.",

The mexican red rice is the best I've tasted around town.  I took pleasure in their pomegranate margaritas.  I also tasted what seemed to be an odd flavor, in my opinion...a strawberry, jalapeno margarita!  It was so darn dee-lish, I think I will order that next time.  :)  The service was extremely friendly and I enjoyed both waitresses that were serving our table.  They were friendly and attentive, without being too attentive, if you know what I mean?  The fried ice cream was great way to end the night too.  It was heavy on the cinnamon, but I didn't mind a bit.  All in all, I will be coming back to this restaurant.",

Not only did our server make sure our needs were met but two other gentelmen came over to make sure everything was to our liking. I spilled my iced tea and someone was at my side as soon as it happened, helping to wipe up the mess. She was really nice about it and within 60 seconds, it was cleaned up and I had a fresh glass of tea. It was as if it had never happened. We were there on their karaoke night and that was a lot of fun. We've decided that we'll always try to go there on karaoke night. Most importantly, the food was delicious. The portions were just right and everything tasted perfect. I'm really excited that we finally tried this place. We're from out of state and there is a Mexican restaurant back home that I miss all the time. This place totally helps fill that void.",

I reenacted in my head the part where I flip.over to the side of the sign that tells your waiter to stop because you need them. The service was special for sure.  My husband has ordered their pozole a few times over and seems to be salty each time he has ordered it. He works nearby and sometimes he comes in there because vendors or board members would like to eat there as a informal lunch meeting so he has more dine-in experience. He has felt they have gone downhill. He doesn't feel the price ratio to food quality match and have been inconsistent. I have to agree because their taco salad was pretty skim considering it starts at 10 bucks then whatever extra it costs to add meat.   5 stars for the corn because I never had mexican street corn until here and I have yet to find a spot that can beat that euphoria I felt upon taking my first bite. Corn wasn't overcooked at all!   Overall, it's just a 3 star spot for me. I was really excited the first <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.in&s=8d414728b554193734ad7c722e8954dcee9ce48656b657f21fa795864ab48b5a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">time.in</a> hopes of finding a good sit down mexican restaurant...but unfortunately, Leticias isn't it for us at least. There's nothing extra special aside <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffrom.it&s=dbb8b39f04499b17bbf9be9a4f54d7cbcdad4766a5bac020c7f50a3cdaa66019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">from.it</a> being the only decent restaurant within the Tule Springs vicinity. Nothing to drive across town for.  They do get busy in there, though, but I have been able to bring a stroller in there without inconvenience and no broken buckle high chairs!",

    "text": "I've been in Las Vegas since 2009 and this restaurant is by far the best Mexican food I've eaten here.   The best part is they are always pretty busy but I've never waited more than 10mins for a table.   I've had a lot of there meals/combos. But I think they have the best Carne Asada. Tonight I had the Nacho fries with the carne Asada. Very full feeling. Didn't even eat them all.  So all the good things said The service has declined and we only saw our waiter 3 times. Once to take our order. Second time to drop off food. Third was our check. The little bus boy had to stop him to refill my drink. This manager lady walked by twice and never offered to refill my empty glass. There used to be a guy named Gus. He made you smile and always told you what was best to order.  This is a good place to eat. But this is definitely not a Texas style Mexican cantina. Still on the search for a New Mexican restaurant i can call home.  Should I go back.........yes no maybe It will be awhile maybe a few months or so.",

    "text": "Am visiting Las Vegas for a basketball tournament.  Had a few hours in between games, Mexican sounded good.    Found Leticia's in the area after a quick search.  When I walked in, the place has an odd smell, maybe it was the furniture or ventilation?  It wasn't an encouraging first impression.  Decor is nice, wood furniture with lots of Windows.  Service very friendly.  When the chips and salsa came, it came with a red, green and bean dip.  Both salsas had excellent flavor and respectable spice level without burning your mouth.  Love bean dip, but this one had a hint of cloves which I don't generally care for.  It grew on me, however, I wondered if all the sauces were going to have \"twists\" on the traditional versions.  I ordered one chicken enchilada green sauce, one shredded beef in red sauce, and one crispy tacos.  When it came out, I got concerned again, since the presentation was really nice.  In my experience, the Mexican places with fancier presentation often lack authenticity. I usually go for no fanfare.    To my surprise however, the chicken enchilada may have been the best I ever had.  Fresh bright flavor including fresh oregano, tart tomatillo sauce and really tender chicken breast.  Generous amount of meat too.  The shredded beef was super tender and flavorful, and the taco shells were lightly fried just the way I do them at home.  Both very good, although the chicken enchilada was the star on this day.  I'm really picky about authenticity, and Letticia's pleasantly surprised me at every turn.  I don't know if I'll ever be back in this remote area, but the locals have themselves a gem in this one.  If you're a stickler for quality and authenticity like I am, you'll really appreciate this place.    Immaculate bathroom for bonus points lol...it matters.",

There's a roasted salsa, a green salsa and a bean and chorizo dip that were all very tasty. I ordered the spicy shrimp and queso taco and my husband ordered the Baja style fish tacos. My tacos were delicious but huge! I couldn't finish the 2 that came in my combo. My husband loved his food too. We will definitely be back!",

My meal of 2 tamales was $13 which is still a bit high but at least there is some work involved in making tamales. Quality of the food is also not as good as it was a few years ago.

We were served their chips with a cilantro dip, what I think was roasted tomato salsa and beans.  We had heard so many good things about the restaurant and I was a bit disappointed.  I had the chili relleno, and enchilada platter. The pepper was tough and a bit bitter as was the red sauce on enchilada. Hubby had the empanadas which he said were ok. My friend had the crunchy chicken tacos and liked them very much.   I will go back to try something different.",

This Mexican Cocina has got it going on! I love the vibe and decor of the restaurant. My first visit was on a Friday night and boy was it packed to the brim in there! The wait was about 40 minutes. If you come during prime time, be prepared to wait a while.  Complimentary chips and salsa are pretty good. I really like the chips. They're warm and super fresh. Vegetarians be warned! The bean dip has chorizo in it. My husband can't get enough of that bean dip. The chorizo gives it an unexpected sweet taste.   The menu is hefty and prices are a little higher than you're average Mexican restaurant. I was ecstatic to learn that Leticia's had potato and cheese flautas ($13.98). Whhaaa! I'm all about that vegetarian flauta life! The entree comes with 3 flautas and a side of rice and beans. The flautas are topped with guacamole, pico, and authentic Mexican queso (the tasty white crumbly cheese). This entree is way too much food for me, but I do my best to eat all I can, savoring every bite!  The Mexican rice here is where it's at it. I am particularly picky when it comes to Mexican rice. The Mexican rice at Leticia's, however, reminds me of the rice my mom and grandma make. I get all nostalgic eating that stuff!   Service could be better, but it's sufficient.    In a nutshell: Food: 5 Ambiance: 4 Service: 3-4  Of course I'll be back! This is the only legit Mexican restaurant I've come across in Vegas.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #12",

Around this amazing sizzling bowl is cactus and thin steak cooked to perfection. The cactus is my favorite. To this day, I've yet to find a Mexican place that makes cactus like the one in this dish. It comes with corn or flour tortillas and rice, beans, guac, and veggies for fajitas. Ive also have the tacos before, the prime rib ones are to die for. The service can be iffy depending on who your waiter is. Margaritas are pretty good and I'm not a margarita person. If you want a strong one, order a Cadillac one.  Update: I came here for a business lunch meeting and I seized on the opportunity to suggest this dish to my colleague. Needless to say, that's his new favorite dish here. I did learn something new!

Drinks were great would have ordered another but waitress was missing for most of our dinner.   After the meal 3 out of 5 left feeling ill. After paying $60 tab for 2 adults 1 child I went home and cooked. I could have complained at restaurant but it appears all Staff are magic and can disappear.  Salsa gross, cheese dip was chunk of hard cold cheese with greasy butter on top",

I would have been less than thrilled if these tacos were served to me for $5 from a Roberto's. Perhaps this was an off night based on other reviews, but I can't recommend eating here.",

The waitress forget about getting tortillas, doesn't even know her own menu and idk she's was just not paying attention at all, which I would understand if it was busy, but it wasn't that night and there was just another table and a couple of ppl @ the bar. The food that I have ordered was wayyy too salty and it just didn't taste good. My fiance ordered a burrito and he said it was alright. They never check on us till the end when we asked for the check and by then they send a manager? To see if we want them to remake the food. But seriously, i just wanna get out of there by then. There's no point of remaking the food when my fiance is done eating and well just end up staying there for probably another hour longer. Just waiting.  Crappy service, meh food, and it's not even cheap. We will not be back. Oh and they were on dirty dining and attempted to hide their grade smh.",

For some reason, there never seems to be a hostess when we go and we wait a while to get seated. There is a nice but small outdoor patio to enjoy the nicer weather.

We were seated shortly after around 4:50 and we waited for our waiter to come take our drink orders. 10 minutes passes and no sign of our waiter. The hostess walked by us after seating another table and asked if we had been helped yet and we replied with a no. She brought us our chips and salsa and we still had not ordered drinks (we didn't even have water). Finally the lady who was refilling waters brought us some, but did not say a word to us and still no sign of a waiter. We waited about another 15 minutes and no one had even acknowledged us so we ended up leaving. Now I understand that it was a Saturday evening and they were busy, but to not even have someone say a word to us or bring us anything except for our hostess was pretty ridiculous! I was extremely disappointed and upset because they actually have really amazing food and I was looking forward to eating it. Definitely better to go around lunch time because you will actually be taken care of.",

They were quite tasty, and I really enjoyed the zucchini and mushrooms that were included in the vegetable mix.  At the end of the meal, one of the owners thanked us for coming in, and we mentioned we were from Nashville. He then had Leticia come over to meet us. They both seemed genuinely pleased to have visitors from so far away. Leticia then surprised us with a free serving of flan to share. It was so completely wonderful--the perfect consistency and taste! Delicious!!  I've never felt so welcomed in a place. I look forward to visiting again.

After waiting 45 minutes for our meal, two out of 3 orders were correct.  My husband ordered a cheese enchilada and a grilled chicken taco.  He was brought a shredded chicken taco.  He does not like stewed shredded chicken.  My daughter ordered a build you own burrito, light sauce, it was swimming.  After 20 minutes into our meal, the waitress finally comes back we let he know the issues with our order.  I traded orders with my daughter, problem solved.  My husband, not so much.  He expressed that he asked for a grilled chicken and received shredded. She referred back to her order notes and realized that he did order grilled and it was definitely a mistake, fine. She asked him if he wanted a new taco he said no thank you, but take the taco off of our tab. She comes back in five minutes with a huge serving spoon and a plate and reaches into my husband plate and scooped up the taco off of the plate, and remind you he was still eating his meal.  Worst experience EVER.!!!!!",

    "text": "Wife was craving spicy food last night...Leticia's is right down the street and look, a $15 for $25 Yelp deal too! This was our third visit to Leticia's and I have to say, I'm a fan!  They've been fairly busy each time we visited but they get you seated quickly. One reason behind my 4 stars is their waiting area. It's extremely small and with the cold weather right now, no one wants to be outside. Last night was a busy night and you could barely get in the door to put your name down. They also don't take reservations so with large groups waiting for a table, it was hard to even find a place to stand out of the way from employees and guests coming/going.  As far as the food goes, I haven't had a bad experience here. As soon as you sit down you're greeted with warm chips and 3 dips, one of which is a bean dip which my wife absolutely loves. They also serve a guacamole style dip and a spicier red salsa. Each one is good, the salsa has a good spice to it and they each have a great fresh homemade taste.    Being a cheese fanatic, on our first visit, I had the QuesaTacos and they are spectacular. Last night I had the tamales and even those surprised me since most \"restaurant tamales\" just aren't that good. I love that they will let you choose two styles in several dishes like the tacos and tamales I've had. I decided on 1 green sauce chicken and 1 red sauce beef tamale. My wife went with shredded chicken enchiladas. The food came out extremely fast and was even brought to us by the Executive Chef of the restaurant. They plate the dishes with generous portions of rice and beans . My tamales were delicious, the masa was moist and fluffy, both meats were juicy and even by themselves had great flavor. The only thing I did not like about the tamales were the onions. I'm usually a fan of onions but they basically threw on some slices of raw onion that just didn't quite work with the tamales. All in all, a great meal and my wife loved the enchiladas as well!  With the $15 for $25 deal, our bill came out to $5.49 (without tip) which included two dinners, one soda and one beer. Beer being another reason for my 4 star review. As another Yelper noted, they serve their beer in frosted mugs which for us beer guys is a little disappointing. Other than that though, Leticia's serves great food at decent prices and we'll definitely be coming back!",

Also the manager came around and greeted us. But he kinda scared me when he said hi because he pop his head around the wall lol!  The salsa was bomb!!!!!!!!! We got the green  salsa and some kind if brown one. The brown salsa was so good! Wish the green salsa wasn't that salty but it would of been really good! We also got beans as out dip too! I mixed the green salsa and bean together so it won't be so salty so that was good.  It took me forever to order cuz I didn't know what to get! Everything sounded so good!   I got the make your own burrito! I got confused of the meat part cuz it i wanted shredded beef so the menu said \"shredded chicken or beef & carnitas\" so I thought they give you both beef and carnitas cuz it didn't say OR . Right? You pick one meat and its a dollar extra if you want another one. So I got charged . Idk what sauce to get for my burrito so I got something red lol and cheese! It was good too! Haha but damn was that burrito huge ;)  haha!   My hubby got 2 tacos they were able to let him choose 2 different meat with no extra charge! Shredded beef and shrimp!  Out waitress also got us a super super spicy salsa! Habanero!! Omg was that spicy!!!!!! I'm on fire!!!! Hahaha!   Soo full after a third of my burrito! Well..Probably cuz all that yummy chips and salsa!   Last but not least! I almost forgot my churro that I saw on yelp that someone posted a picture! And that looked bomb! And guess what!

She said its order on ask so I was aww oka but then  she still got it for me!! :) yaya! Couldn't eat the churro there :( but it had to be eaten that night ! And it was warm still when I got home!

    "text": "My fiance and I decided to check this place out via a referral from a friend. We waited about 20 to 30 minutes to be seated which was fine as they were busy at the time. After we sat down though our waitress was nice she was really slow at attending to our table. Once our food finally came to our table it looked as though it had been sitting for awhile. You know when you put fresh beans on the plate they have a moistness to them.. These looked like dried old beans along with this on my fiance's plate he also received a taco where literally the shell wasn't cooked, it's as though they took it out of the package onto the plate no heating at all, the waitress didn't believe him so he had her physically touch the shell which was raw and she agreed and seemed taken back by it. The main course of his dish was cold on the inside which brought him to believe it was frozen then just reheated. As for my plate im vegetarian and found something suitable enough for me the volcanes, I asked the waitress to leave the cheese off to the side as I'm more vegan than vegetarian. After waiting for about an hour to get our food a different waitress finally brought our plates and there on my meal the cheese was on top. Since we'd been waiting so long I was like screw it I'll just eat it. Though I found out the guacamole and the pico have jalapenos in it which im allergic to unfortunately so I sent the plate back and since they aren't really a vegan friendly restaurant I settled for the Spanish rice which tasted like it came from a box. For all the hype this restaurant puts out it was extremely over priced for what you get and the service is horrible. I wouldnt recommend this place. The only reason I gave two stars was because the ambiance of the physical restaurant itself was nice.",

Unlike other places that have gotten that notoriety and now require reservations 6 months in advance, Leticia's keeps it a hunnit. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the quesa tacos which is their signature dish. I've always had great service. It takes some time to get your food, but it's worth it. If it were an option they might get a 1/2 star deduction for that. It's a small place so it might be busier on Friday or Saturday nights. I tend to go when I can make the trek across town which is usually a Sunday afternoon. Just something to keep in mind.",

My husband scooped it up with a napkin. We all just sort of froze out of disbelief! When the waiter stopped by a few moments later, my son announced there had been a roach on our table. My husband discreetly handed him (Mario) the napkin. He didnt seem too frazzled by this.   Mario informed us that the owner have been spending a lot of money trying to fix their bug problem! Umm??? Hello??? They know they have a serious problem and they are still serving costumers???   I left the table and went to the car. When my husband showed up I asked him what they did or said about this. He said they gave us 3 dollars off our meal! Wow, thanks!   There is a call being put into the health dept. on this issue. ROACHES and food dont mix!!!!",

    "text": "We had a party of about yesterday.  We were all very impressed with the ambience, the service, the food, especially from the lovely owner. 1. Our iced tea were kept full all the times. 5* 2. We had chips and salsa, 3 kinds. Fried rolls and chicken tostada, I think  (see photo). Sorry for my lack of understanding about Mexican food. The chops are thick and crunchy, but not too hard nor greasy. It went well with the salsas. The tostada were just right, crunchy, deep flavor, juicy but not soggy. I don't know how they did it. Perhaps with a touch of bean. I gave 5* for food quality. 3. The friendliness of the staff and the owner coupled with a cozy but upper class setting guaranteed my return here with my family. I gave another 5*.",

They have 2 options, $15 for beef, chicken and pork (5 options) and $20 for those plus seafood ones (8 or 9 options). We got the cheaper one to try because we were unsure of how good they were. They were great! They were stuffed with meat (not skimpy at all) with onions and cilantro and they give you some guacamole, limes and some come with sauces to put on them.  They also have happy hour from 2-6 and have a bunch of small plates for $3 and $5. We tried the shrimp ceviche and cochinita pibil that were both $3. They were pretty good too. They also give you chips with different salsas and refried beans. Your first check-in, you can get a free margarita. If you go during happy hour tho, you can get one for $5 and they're a pretty good size.  If I remember right, their specials are: Monday- Ayce street tacos Tuesday- buy one get one margaritas Wednesday- 50% off wine Thursday- kids eat free",

    "text": "The food was excellent. I had chilaquilles with ranchero sauce. Before ordering, I tried the mole as well. It was fantastic. My meal came with beans and chorizo potatoes - both well seasoned and great tasting.  If it were just about the food, I would give 4 1/2 stars (some salt could have been added); but, my service was terrible. I had to ask for silverware, then salt and pepper, and my water stood empty at the edge of my table, directly in front of my server while she stood chatting with other servers. She did come ask me how my food was, but ignored my water glass.  So if bad service doesn't bother you, buen provecho!   I'm back for a second try. I'm having the hamburguesa.  When I got here the waitlist was 15 minutes but I hopped right up to the bar. Trevor greeted me promptly and offered chips and salsa. I had to ask for napkins (again); this seems like a trend because others sitting at the bar had to do the same thing.  My food came quickly. It was cooked competently- but the description didn't match the low level of flavor. I still feel like the food is under seasoned - I had to ask for macha (some sort of chilies).  Service was sooooooooo much better!  I wish the flavors were more interesting.  Third time is a charm! Ramiro gave us excellent service. I didn't have to ask for napkins! And the food tasted wonderful.",

You come hungry and leave happy and full. Not only are the award winning tacos they offer award winning but you get some extremely good chips and salsa. Don't forget the several flavors of salsa (and even yummy dipping refried beans too) they offer and definitely try the amazing guacamole. The guacamole isn't just a little bowl of green mash either, it is a flavorful mix of chunks of perfectly ripe avocados, tomatoes, etc.., and even some incredible fresh Mexican cheese that adds that perfect touch to finish off the guacamole perfection that it is.   I don't even really like guacamole, it reminds me of well baby poop, but rather guacamole they serve a Leticias is one that not only I could buckets of it's is something I randomly drool about even though it's been a few months since I've tasted it.  Whatever they wait you might run into is well worth the time. Happy eating",

They checked on us several times and made sure we were happy, satisfied, and had everything we needed.

A large heavy black clay bowl with fish clams mussels shrimp topped with a lobster tail in a red sauce w/pablano peppers and then they give you cheesy rice to mix in makes everything gooey delicious they also give you corn or flour tortillas.

When we arrive, told no more seats at the bar area, she's closed and we're sat on the other side of the restaurant. Server explains no happy hour unless in bar area. Once I explained what we were told, server checks with the manager and comes back with a no can do! So, of course I ask to speak to manager,  who comes to the table and still claims that even though that section is closed, she offers us to move to the bar, but there are no seats open. She is not able to honor the happy hour prices. Basically she said it's a promo to get people in; what I get from this: once they get 10-12 at the bar for happy hour, there's no more happy hour pricing, which is False advertising! Shame on you! We left! There's Happy hour all over town, we went to Lindo Michoacan and were treated wonderfully.  *update 9/4/17 - regarding owners response****  Of course, leave it to the greedy owner to respond with an answer that clearly reinforces the poor employees decision! They had to say no because Ms Leticia has threatened them!!! Ha! You're making plenty of money, you're restaurant is always busy, shame on you!! That is no way to treat your loyal customers. Greed will only ruin and destroy you. Good luck with all that!",

This is the Leticia's that I have long remembered and appreciated. Also, a big bonus is the freshly made tortillas from their new tortilla station!!! Restrooms are large and clean. Atmosphere was positive, lively and on the loud side. Park behind the restaurant for best parking options. It seems like road construction is always happening in this area.",

BUT I have ordered other entrees through Grub Hub and was disappointed. Tonight I ordered a house dinner salad with carne Asada and sauteed veggies (both optional add-ons). The veggies were not sauteed. It was raw mushroom and raw zucchini. The spring mix was sparse, there were very few tomatoes, and there definitely wasn't enough dressing to cover the salad. The carne asada was good, but that's about all I can say.   I'm not completely knocking this place, but maybe dine-in instead of Grub Hub so you can give feedback and fix your order.",

We went during happy hour, and tried everything on their happy hour menu, all of which was shockingly affordable and shockingly delicious. The house margaritas were excellent, too. The chips and salsa were AMAZING.  The atmo is sort of casual upper-middle-class-suburban Tex-Mex, and they have a patio for outdoor dining, where you can bask in the breeze created by all the SUVs blasting down one of those ginormously expansive asphalt rivers that pass for roads up there.  Overall, it was excellent food at a great price, but I probably would not drive all the way up here to eat here. If they opened a location closer to midtown, then maybe.",

Went last night and the service was slow and confused...the noisy drunks at the bar were annoying...and the food wasn't nearly up to par...flavorless carnitas and the rice and beans were dried out and seemed to have been sitting on the plate for a while.  Very disappointing from a place we had reaaly enjoyed in the past.",

I had an amazing watermelon Agua Fresca and carne asada. Portions were HUGE and presentation was perfect. Sometimes Mexican restaurants can just slop their portions together, but this is not the case here.   It may not be Abuela's food to a \"T\" but it's pretty darn good! We put a lot of weight in customer service and this place does not disappoint!",

She disappeared again and re-appeared at 11:30 only after I let the busser know that we were ready (HAD BEEN READY) to order our food. She took our order and when I asked about \"margaritas\" she defensively shifted the blame on the bartender.  Our drinks, which inc. a  $9 \"margarita\" which, I feel, had a heaping tsp of tequila arrived at about 11:40. ONE HOUR later (12:05) we still had no food in front of us. When the busser, not our disappearing waitress, asked \"how's everything?\" we said we were still waiting for our food!!!  Several min later, our \"waitress\" re-appeared on \"regretfully\" said the kitchen was out of the entree dish we both ordered.  Shouldn't the kitchen communicated this to the wait staff PRIOR to the opening or at least when we FIRST placed the order... not 25 min later??? When we finally get our revised order, the food was mediocre.  However, I order the chicken tinga burrito and almost threw up when on my second bite, I chomped on a 3\" bone!!!! GROSSS!!!! The manager came by and apologize and stated she was going to speak with ...get this....The VENDOR who supplies the pre-cooked chicken to the restaurant.  They don't even cook their own chicken!! The best part of that 1 hour 45 min experience was the complimentary fried ice cream  and the visit with my friend.   Lindo Michoacan, Here I come from now on!!",

    "text": "Had lunch here today. First let me start by saying the food is great. The salsa brought with chips when you are seated ( and you server acknowledges your existence) its so delicious it makes it a little hard to write this review. We had to ask the busser to take our drink order, then about 10 mins later we had to ask him to have someone come take out order. With a 3 yr old and 1 yr old in our party it was getting ridiculous. Our busser (great young guy) hurried around the restaurant doing as much as he could for several tables I saw the servers standing off to the side talking. As we waited for our food another patron was up front complaining she had only seen her server once and was NOT happy about her service. One of our water cups was dirty and when the guy came around to refill it was with carbonated water and had to give us all new water (no biggie) the food FINALLY came and the kids were beyond starving (took about 30 mins) I could understand if the place was busy but there were 4/5 tables max... The food was a little cold but tasted great. The place is clean and the decor is very nice. The music and the salsa were my favorite part. We left a nice tip (for the busser) it's sad to think this kid worked as hard as he did for a woman whom we interacted with twice to get the tip.. I'm not sure the salsa is enough to bring us back. Staff really needs to get it together even on a slow day. People that were seated after us had their order taken before us and we had to ASK to helped.",

If you are in a hurry, don't come here.  My visits here have not been \"slow\" but this is a sit down restaurant and the kitchen takes a little while.  Kitchens are slower when they are making food from scratch - the end result is better food.  I've always had friendly service and last time I was in they were training some nice new people.  Kids menu is very reasonable and there are tons of choices - all of them mexican food.  If your kids will only eat chicken fingers and boxed mac n cheese then I suggest a chain restaurant.  My daughter liked her taquitos, beans, and home made vanilla ice cream.  I'm glad this restaurant opened in our neighborhood.  I wouldn't drive across town just to eat here but it is worth a shorter trip or a visit if you are in the area.",

The atmosphere was pleasant, the staff was super polite and engaging while we were there (I know, as opposed to when we were not there).  Serving sized were more then adequate, flavor was off the charts and prices were reflective of the quality product the cooks placed in front of you. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to have the corn on the cob plate, which looked amazing on the other table (party of 16 all had one).  Monday night and it was busy with only a five minute wait.  My wife had a enchilada, my daughter the burrito (enchilada style) and I had the Two Tacos, which actually had additional flour tortillas, so it was actually like Four Tacos. The cheesecake was probably the best I have had in Vegas.  Very surprised by this little slice of heaven we found.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Thank you .",

So amazing, and a mo ths worth of cheating in one meal. Just have to mention a couple of things that have disappointed me in my last few visits. At least the 3 most recent times that I have decided to go to Leticias have been based on the awesome weather, and wanting to sit outside on their patio. Every time, Ive been told that they have no server for the outside. Its not like I went there once a week for 3 weeks. How can this be? The patio is amazing, and so cute, and when the weather is good, to sit outside and chat and eat does not compare to sitting inside with a/c and a loud restaurant- so that was a bummer. Multiple times. The other thing is that I got my world rocked by the vegan tamales on a previous visit, and tried to order them on the next few visits, and was told that they were out of them. If it werent for those things- it'd be a 5 star. Please Leticias- get some people to man the patio. The weather is amazeballs right now, and Im getting the itch! Dont let me down!!",

Sometimes they get very busy and the food many take a few extra minutes to come out, but I understand that happens sometimes and it's worth the wait. The prices are fair and I'm always more than satisfied when I leave there. Management is always friendly and will go out of their way to say hello and make sure all is going well when dining at Leticia's. I hate when I see negative comments about Leticia's on Yelp.

    "text": "I'd say more like 3.5 stars.  We tried this place for the first time Friday night.  I am always happy when a restaurant opens up here in Centennial.  Now let's just hope it can STAY open!  There were good things about Leticia's and a few not-so-good things.   THE GOOD Our chips and salsa and waters were brought to our table right away... like within 3 minutes of sitting down.  I like that.  The chips weren't anything special by any means, but both types of salsa were very flavorful.  I especially liked the chipotle based one.  The menu had a lot of variety, lots of things I would have liked to try.  It was hard to decide what I'd try first.  The prices were very reasonable for big portions.  My shrimp tacos were excellent.  (The rice that came with them was a different story, but more on that below.)  I'm embarrassed to admit that we ate through a whole basket of chips and a whole cup of that chipotle salsa.... but happy to say that we didn't even have to ask.... they just brought us more as soon as we were done.  The service staff seems to work very well together.  They seemed on top of things everywhere we looked, and were definitely good to us.  THE BAD My husband's seafood enchiladas were definitely \"meh.\"  Very bland tasting, with more of a pasta-type sauce on top.  But even more bland was the rice that came with my shrimp tacos.  UGH that was some nasty, dry, tasteless stuff!  Our desserts were very fairly priced, but just kinda \"meh\" too.  He got the fried ice cream, which had a kind of stale-tasting shell around the ice cream.  I had the sopapillas, which were ok.  I mean it's just fried dough with some cinammon and sugar.... there's not a whole lot you can do with that ... but I have had better.  If I were going with my kids, this would be up in the \"good\" section, but because we were out on \"date night,\" I'll put this here.  This place is VERY much a family restaurant.  Like I said, that can be a GOOD thing if you have kids... and I would definitely think of taking my daughter here ... but if you're going for a date night type atmosphere, I wouldn't choose this place.  There were LOTS of kids... pretty noisy.    And I'm apparently in the minority here since it seems that every restaurant is doing this now.... but I don't understand why there has to be TVs playing sports on every wall.  At a sports bar/pub?  Yes.  At a Mexican Cocina?  I don't get it.    All-in-all we liked our experience there pretty much.  I won't be rushing back, but I wouldn't mind going again to try some other stuff.",

The portions are a good size, so that is a plus and service was good.  The red sauce on the enchiladas was really potent as I would not recommend it at all.  I would say give this a try, but as this was a hike for us to get to, I would rather go the opposite direction to Mi Casa where the beef enchiladas with red sauce are delicious!

But we used to live a couple of miles away in Centennial Hills, and now that we have moved to Henderson, our \"couple of minutes\" drive changed to a \"little over a half hour\" drive.  But, um, we still do it...  Here's a quick list of why: 1) Best Margarita in the valley.  Well, if you like them... I know, every place makes them differently, but here they use multiple fresh squeezed lime slices and that works with the pattern of fresh food here, and it's really tasty. 2) Best interesting drink - the Pomegranite Margatini is totally unique and I can't even list all of the ingredients here...  But it's one of my wife's favorite drinks of all time! 3) Ignacia - oh, yeah, the Margatini is generally only a good drink if she's the one who makes it.  Everything she makes is awesome, even if she's taking care of the bar and the entire dining room at the same time... 4) Ignacia again - sorry to be redundant, but beyond drinks, she knows the food and what mama's making, and knows what is good, and very quickly learns what you like!  Which is invaluable... Even if you don't know what to order, just let her do it. 5) To be fair, even if Ignacia is not working, the food is all fantastic and the drinks are awesome.  I just wish they'd open a place in Henderson!",

We've been to Leticia's more times than I can count in the year that I've lived here.  We've brought every one of our house guests to Leticia's - and that's a whole bunch because when you live in Vegas people come out of the woodwork to visit.  Everyone we've introduced to Leticia's has fallen in love, just like we did.  Some of our favorites include: Poblano White Rice Casserole (I order it on the side no matter what else I'm ordering), El Molcajete, Quesa Tacos, Sopa de Consomme (which I get to go every time I'm sick) and their bean dip.  The chips are dangerously addicting.  We've never had anything that was bad.  Also, the service is great.  The first time we went our waiter, Mario, was so fantastic that we request to sit in his section every time we visit Leticia's.  He know's the menu inside and out always gives the best suggestions!    Also, I have to say, I am allergic to MSG and normally stay away from ordering anything with sauce and almost never order soup in restaurants.  If I eat anything with MSG in it I get a horrific migraine the next day.  I have never had a negative reaction to their food.  Before I ordered the soup I asked if they made it in house.  The chef got on the phone and said it was made in house and from scratch.  I wish there were more restaurants like this one!",

The food was great and drinks kept coming.  This by far is my favorite restaurant. I love the atmosphere and the great customer service I always receive.  Thank you for making it so special!",

I wish Leticia's was good because it's right around the corner from our house but sadly it's not worth the time. Such a bummer since we love Mexican food.",

Other plate was street tacos, al pastor and carne Asada. Al pastor was real good but not the carne. They charged me .75 cents for extta slices of lime. That is laughable. Prices are high here for less than average food. TV kept blinking in and out every minute as well. Service was very slow.",

At the end of our meal we stayed for dessert the Ambiance was beautiful we ordered the sopapillas and the churros we had our 12 year old son with us. I give leticias a five-star the food did not disappoint we will definitely be going back. Our waitress was amazing the staff was very nice and helpful and we're attentive.

It proves what a good recipe and the proper management can do to set the tone for a great restaurant! Fieri may have to rate it better than his own! Just say'n!   Traveling North America with an average of 160+ flights a year, I focus on good food where I go and have been fortunate to come across some of the locations I do. From clients proud of their favorites to hearing local banter about this one or that one...   We found out about Leticia's by someone at the local Shuck's raving about it. So craving Mexican food, and wanting to stay near by, I searched until I recognized the name.  So glad we went!  Unbelievable flavor and with potato which is a rarity. The latter was something I learned from the locals living in Tucson and working over the boarder in Nogales in the late 90s. (Thanks Maritza). I've craved this combination of flavors and have sought it ever since.  It is tough to find... But, Leticia's has it! Way to be authentic and True! Thanks!",

Drive by a few days later the patio is full of people....white people! Today November 11,2017 I went here at 5:35pm and was told immediately by the hostess NO we can't sit on the patio it's closed. Please see my attached photo of all the people sitting on the patio! Who closes a patio at 5 o'clock on a busy Saturday? I asked for the \"manager\" Ricardo and after waiting forever for him to come to the front he said it's closed because it's chilly. Again it's full of people sitting out there. So now the weatherman/manager determines customers chill factor when it comes to sitting on a patio? From what I gather the patio is closed to African Americans so if you're black don't ask to sit on the patio. Better yet go through the back door so you want scare away her white customers!!!",

Second the drinks were great tasting, strong and very smooth. The food. OMG!!!  I ordered the shrimp cocktail. They should call it the endless shrimp cocktail because every spoon full I had shrimp. No need for extra salt nor pepper. It was just right. And the price was very good not to expensive.  Will be raving about this place for a long time.  I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and this place has the music and the taste of being in Mexico. Very clean. Also the decor was very cool and just enough lighting for a family dinner or a date night. All around can't go wrong",

They were having staffing issues so our waitress who typically bartender was having a hard time keeping up. The chips and salsa were just ok and it took a long time for her to even take our drink order. Once we finally placed our order I made it clear I do not want beans . Sadly they showed up right on my plate with my chile releno .. Overall it was just not as good as I heard. My friends quesadilla had issues too but I didn't try it . We did have her apologies and I understand sometimes these things happen. Hopefully if I get the chance to try it out again they will wow me but for now it's just meh",

It was delicious and amazing to the tune of \"why have I not wandered into this place?\" It's literally up the street, about a 15 minute walk, which comes in handy post-margarita...

Went tonight and WOW the prices have gone up!! I ordered a Taco salad and a margarita. We just missed happy hour and the $9 house margarita was weak and watery. A lackluster start....I ordered a taco salad with ground beef (like a taco) and my husband had the queso fundido with chorizo which was good this time. When the bill came, my taco salad was $10 with ground beef $3 more?? so my husband nicely asked \"why the up charge on the taco salad?\" The server told us \"Oh it's $10 for a vegetarian taco salad, the taco beef is $3 extra\"  LMAO! Really??!  Isn't a \"vegetarian taco salad\" just a SALAD? Now, I am happy to pay the price for good food but don't like getting \"nickle & dimed\" on dining out. Also, if you don't order a full meal or a bar beverage the complimentary chips and salsa are $4.50! Sorry Leticia, Michoacan is way better.",

    "text": "Ok...... first of all, I dont remember the last time i gave a bad review. Three of us were there Friday night to eat dinner before a 730 movie. We got there at 6:05. They said it would be 20-25 mins wait...ok.. we can wing it! We got to our table at 7:03. Ya... one hour wait. We sat down and just ordered our simple drinks because i didnt want to take extra time ordering a margarita. Ordered our food right away.. told the waitress we had a 730 movie. She said it would probably be 25 mins before the food came out... im like... we can inhale! There's always 25 mins of previews!!! Now you have to understand i am a Chairman at Station Casinos and am there(quite a bit) i've eaten at the formally known as Cabo restaurant quite a bit...and it was good! I think its the first time since they redid it as Leticias that ive eaten there. The food was horrible. My crunchy chicken taco was soggy and obviously left under the lights... how do i know this??? Cause my cheese was melted on the lettuce of my taco.. simply nasty. My boyfriends fajita was the most bland ever... with i think 4 pieces of chicken in it.....and an assortment of things i have never seen in fajitas like zucchini. Nothing had any flavor and im pretty sure they stuck pork in my almost nonexistent cheesy chicken enchilada that im used to. If we weren't in such a hurry i would have spoken to someone... point is... i wont eat there anymore...it isnt the same food and it is not better.i rather eat at the cafe of go to the Charcoal room... i rather eat at Robertos which is 4 star compared to this restaurant..... sorry.",

    "text": "Three strikes and you're out. We gave Leticia's three tries and the last time made us decide we would never go back. So here are the pros and cons.   Pros: the chips, bean dip and sauces are wonderful. I especially like the tomatillo salsa.   Cons: my salted Margarita was served in a mason jar. Seriously. When I asked for a regular margarita glass the server brought a glass to the table and wanted me to pour my current drink into the new glass. Bad, bad manners. I had him just take the whole drink away.   3 out of the 4 guests ordered the hard tacos. There was nothing spectacular about them. Neither one of the orders, one chicken and two beef, were seasoned very well. It just tasted like fried tortilla. I've had better tacos from Roberto's.   The third person ordered the beef enchiladas. The tortillas were gooey, the meat was runny (too much sauce) and the sauce tasted over cooked. The only good thing was the onions on top. But they couldn't even finish the meal. It was that bad.   For anyone who has had actual GOOD Mexican food knows this is not it. Sadly.   My search will continue for good Mexican food in Las Vegas. If you are ever in Carson City NV, the best Mexican food I have ever had, consistently, for over 30 years is EL Charro Avitia.",

The entrees were delicious and the salsas to die for; offering so much more than \"American\" Mexcan that you typically find in a Mexican restaurant.  Atmosphere is lovely. Very happy they are offering lunch, as the former restaurant located there did not. If you were a fan of the original Leticia's at Norman Rockwell Lane, you will get the same great service and food and not be disappointed. Speaking of service, Tami does a fabulous job as bartender and server. She is attentive and knowledgeable and makes you feel welcome. So all you Leticia's fans, go visit them at the Santa Fe and support a locallly owned business.",

    "text": "UPDATE: After coming here quite a few times... food is still great, but service is very slow. There's usually a wait later at night, and they seem short staffed on weekends. Every time we wait about 20-30 min to get seated, a long time to get our drinks and food ordered, then even longer to get the food. By the time we are given our check we just want to get the heck out of there cause we've been sitting for so long! We come for the food and the convenience of location, no longer for the service.   My go to Mexican restaurant ever since I moved up in the area! I've been here quite a few times.   Most of the servers are very accommodating (minus one experience). So many options on the menu! Many of the appetizers are great for sharing amongst friends. And my usual go-to entree is the Taquiza dinner with grilled fish or shrimp. Large portions. A decent amount of tequila options, although I usually just get beer.   Be prepared to wait if it's later during the weekend. This place is pretty popular, so just be aware that there may be a wait time, but it's worth it!",

Prob one of the better places to get Mexican food that's not on the east side of Vegas and def better than the other Mexican chains in Vegas. Parking is a pain.

I actually have been back quite a few times and haven't posted - yet - on the long wait times for seating and service. The food has improved, and I'm glad we gave it a chance, but based on this response - which was written on time when the food poisoning occurred - I'm DONE.   We hadn't even seen the Dirty Dining bit until after the food poisoning happened. We have quite a few friends who also love this restaurant and updated me that things were \"back to normal\" in terms of food quality this summer, so I did give it a shot. However, considering this response, I'm a bit disappointed that Leticia herself would respond in this manner like a petulant child instead of a professional.   Since seeing this response, I've been consistent in telling others close to me to avoid a business that treats its regulars with such disdain. I loved your food, I really did. But your reaction says to me that you don't need my money nor the money of friends and family.",

I first noticed this place in a food show where this restaurant competed against some top notch restaurants on the Strip and they won!  A bit of warning, this is not Tex Mex, so the flavors are more on the milder side. If you need to, they offer various hot sauces.  I ordered the soft tortilla soup and it was great with the subtle tomato flavor with a squeezed lime is a good balance to bean and starchy flavor.  You can also appreciate the care they put into their chicken enchiladas, it's baked perfectly without being overcooked, the shredded chicken is moist and seasoned perfectly.  It's a great deal for $11 and change.  If there is any drawback is the drive here from the Strip, it would take 30 - 35 minutes to get here.  But that won't detract from the great food.",

The atmosphere was lively and the restrooms clean and in order.  When I checked into Yelp there was an offer to purchase a coupon that would save $10.  I purchased it on my cell phone and Dulce redeemed it for this receipt all within 5 minutes!

First we were seated in a corner booth with no light, then we ordered Margaritas & our food came out before we even got our drinks.  Then, we got our food & the disappointment continued.  The Carnitas were supposed to be a favorite, but were not edible. The Carne Asada was edible, but still disappointing.  My son has a cheese Quesadilla that was good thankfully & the chips were very enjoyable.  However, to say the least we won't be returning.",

We went for an early dinner late lunch 3pm, just thought I should mention that since maybe they weren't into the full cooking swing yet. I ordered the chicken fajitas and she ordered cheese enchiladas. It smelled great with the peppers and onions. Unfortunately the chicken had no seasoning, it was as if they just bought the chicken from Albertsons and grilled it with no spices. The beans tasted like Rosaritas straight out of the can. The cheese enchiladas Were hard on the tortilla edges. So we both agreed not to go there again. We could of cooked that same meal with more flavor for less. Just my opinion. I know others like this place but its just not for us.",

We loved the chips and the three dips and both got super fresh salads with the taco lunch special.  My husband had the ground beef taco and I had the carnitas and it was filled with lots of delicious meat and we loved the beans and rice too.  We asked for some hotter sauce and it was hot but tasty.  We also had some delicious margaritas.  We live in CA but will definitely make the trip to Leticia's the next time we are in town.",

First off, we don't live in Centennial Hills so we were already thinking this place better be good if we're driving 30 minutes for Mexican food, but then again, that's a reasonable drive as long as the food's good.  I must say, Leticia's did not disappoint.  It was pretty busy when we got there so we started off with a couple of Leticia's Margaritas at the bar.  They definitely hit the spot after a long work week.  I ordered the birria, which was delicious although maybe a bit salty for my taste.  The puffy tacos with chile verde my wife ordered needed more flavor, but were otherwise decent.  The highlight of the meal had to be the Mexican grilled corn we just had to have after seeing the table next to us order.  We will definitely be back again with so much more we wanted to try.",

I love the complimentary green salsa as well as the red salsa. Only complaint from me is service. Bartenders are awesome but wait staff, is not always the best. I work as a server as well & I just believe you should always make your guests feel welcomed rather than a nuisance. Our server Dolce (i believe was her name, didn't get a receipt) was extremely rude. My friends and I sat without water for about 20 minutes. we consistently tried to get our servers attention & she just kept walking away from our table as we were trying to order a drink. & then when I finally got frustrated and went to the bar to order my Bloody Mary, she asked me why I didn't order the drink through her! & when I responded saying that I had tried to, several times, she told me I didn't. Whatever, I just kept to myself but when it came to paying we had asked for separate checks & she brought one check & then disappeared for another 15 minutes & then split the checks with the wrong items on each bill. TWICE. I can understand that being confusing had there of been 10 of us or something but there were only 3. It's not that hard. Needless to say, my friends and I got so frustrated that we just paid the bill and then figured out the proper amounts later on. Overall experience... Disappointing, but I will be back nonetheless because the food is good.",

We arrived at the restaurant at 9:30pm only to find the \"closed\" sign up and the staff sweeping the floors. I spoke to a lady and reminded her that they had just told me 10pm and she shrugged. So we took our business to nearby Lindo Michoacan who stay open until the hours posted on their sign. We won't be back. What a shame...",

I haven't seen him in forever and he said he wanted some mexican food. I chose Leticia's because my sorority sisters suggested (and they are mexican) this place! They said it was a nice sit down restaurant with some really good food. So, of course we had to check it out!  It's located in a beautiful area (super far from my house) in north town. I was surprised! The outside atmosphere looked like a really nice place to sit outside. It was really hot weather at the time so we went inside and got greeted right away from two beautiful ladies! We were seated immediately at a booth. It's really authentic looking decor. Lots of awesome designs and fun things to look at all around the room. Our booth was kinda small for the three of us, but we managed. The two waiters we had were super nice! They spoke in spanish (and my friend spoke spanish as well since he worked in Chile the past two years) so it was pretty awesome to watch! I love mexican food! They started us off with a bowl of chips with two different salsas and beans. They even refilled it if we ever wanted some more! Now time for the hard part. Choosing what to eat. The menu is filled with so many options!  I decided to go with the lunch specials. There were a bunch you could choose from, and I got the burrito lunch special enchilada style with verde sauce on top. It came with lettuce, tomato, beans, and mexican rice. Boy was it super yummy! The burrito was smothered in sauce and cheese. I had to use cholula sauce to add a bit of flavor. The atmosphere inside was really fun. The waiters constantly checked up on us. They even had me try the spiciest sauce there, and MAN was I burning up!!! You should definitely try it if you want a KICK!  They were kind enough to offer dessert which looked delicious, but we turned it down because we were so stuffed from our entree. If you are in this area and want some awesome mexican food other than a chain fast food stop, definitely try this place out! Definitely glad that we did.",

Maybe this was not the time for an expansion. I have been sitting here waiting for a table with my family. I have seen maybe 3 to 5 groups all turn away once they hear \"sorry we only ONE sever till 5pm\". Is this restaurant doing that well to turn away so many paying customers?? Oh wait no more then half of the restaurant is empty due to staffing. I have been here before only the food was great the staff was awesome--- what happened??? Management/Owners remember the folks that made your other location inside a casino happen!!! Once we sat down our sever was nice, But not very knowledgeable on what they had as far as drinks. So the fresh Mexican waters---- we where told the \"lady that makes those waters didn't show up\". Then our real sever showed up???? We had a person just filling in??? Can't wait to place our order!",

I asked for the tortilla bowl and then told the server what else I wanted. When it was served it was a salad in a dish, no tortilla and my refried beans were missing. My husband ordered the carnitas. The rice was too salty and he could not figure out how they cooked the pork. It was dry and he thought it had been deep fried. he was also, supposed to get \"fresh, handmade\" corn tortillas. They brought his lunch, he asked for his \"corn\" tortillas which never came out until his food was half gone and cold, and they were flour, not corn. One other friend ordered the two tacos, which were served on a coaster sized tortilla with a small bowl of beans and a scoop of rice. There are too many Mexican restaurants here that are much better.

    "text": "So just some back ground here. We haven't been here in a long while but for good reason. A ways back we had placed an order for pick up. Called in for some soup and salsa and chips I think. Anyway... my someone goes to pick up the soup and left with some degree of burns down her side and stomach. When the people packaged it on on top of the other... the soups were so hot that it melted through there insufficient styrofoam and plastic lid containers... spilling all over my someone. My partner turns around and walks back into receive help and needs to have the order filled as it's now all over her and the side walk. Here is where it gets worse. Not only did the staff not seem to care she was burned.. but they never even said \"sorry this happened to you\". We don't have expectations but I guess you would just think human to human you might show some sort of compassion... so the customer service in this moment was terrible and disappointing.. honestly very below standards. So let's flash forward to the present. Being as vegan as possible here we try to order a vinaigrette salad with no cheese as well as potato taquito with no cheese and no crema anywhere etc. they also bring over two salsas and some refried beans. A second server comes over for some reason and we ask to swap the refried beans for the black. Mind you this is a complimentary spread with the bar service we also ordered. We get DENIED this request and told there would be a charge. Then dude disappeared. Our original server returned later.. our food runner comes out and guess what is all over the food and salad... cheese. Oh and instead of the rice and black beans that came with the entree, it was black beans and refried beans?!? The server was very polite and very efficient, apologized and returned quickly with re plated food. Technically the rolled tacos were cross contaminated at they did end up in the refried beans from the first plate.. but we caught it so not too big a deal. When you check in you get a free margarita.. flagged down that guy from earlier who blew off our dietary request for black beans with the comp spread.. also blew off my second drink request. We went to the bartender and her ran it out directly. There was also a nice gal who refilled our chips and salsa. So aside from the inept, rude guy who seemed to visit our table for no reason other than too blow us off... our needs were mostly met and salsa and chips were good. The potato option is nice for vegans and veggie eaters. But I don't think we will be back all the same. It's the bad apple and the 2nd degree burns that kinda ruin it. But you might like the food.",

Being from the southwest I like to think of myself as a decent judge of Mexican food, and this place just tanks. My whole family left hungry and gagging from the gut bomb this place creates.

The times I've been here, there's more gringos and gringas than Mexicans.  I do love their chips, tomatillo, chipotle and bean dips for sure. I can eat 2 baskets of their chips. 5/5  I've tried their signature dish: Quesa Taco. Loaded with cheese, very flavorful and very salty. I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic, they gave me tomatoes anyway. I scraped the tomatoes off but I guess not all since my lips were puffier than their puffy tacos. 3/5  Puffy Tacos: Fried flour tacos. Greasy. Rice was salty. 3/5  I love horchata. They don't have free re-fills though.  The wait can be ridiculous even with a reservation. There are parts of the room that is dark and warm (to the left of the hostess' booth) and bright and freezing (to the right). Bring a scarf/jacket just in case.",

Really odd considering the more broth like soup I had been accustomed to. I later learned there are various ways to make it and this was one. Either way we brought it to out kind waiters attention and he took it off the bill and was very understanding.  The food was too authentic for me to never try it again...... So I've actually been back numerous times since... For business meeting, lunch specials and just for fun.  It's fast becoming my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant !!!!! It's a little pricey, but this can be avoided mainly by going during lunchtime! :) I'm sure they'll get another start once I've tried more on the menu.  Love love love this place!!",

Of course I was a little hesitant because good authentic Mexican food is hard to come by. Anyway, the first thing that caught my eye when we pulled up was people were already lined up waiting for tables outside (presumably). Must me common place for a Friday evening about 7pm. Once we parked and got in, I think we waited maybe 30 minutes. During the wait, we took the opportunity to look at the pictures on Yelp, so we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. I recommend you doing so as well because the menu has a lot to choose from and it all looks good. Once we were seated, Luciano greeted us and took our orders. We shared the guacamole with crab and shrimp (minus the spicy, but still a bit spicy) and the quesatacos!! Both we delicious. Authentic flavors and everything. By the way, the chips and salsa were great too.  We actually over indulged in the chips and salsa, so we barely touched the guacamole. Don't get too full on the chips and salsa, you'll miss out on the food!! Overall, great place. I'd recommend it and definitely done here again!",

We got there at 6:30 and we're served at 8:45. The place was not crowded. We were tired and done but the waitress spent time yelling at another waiter behind us instead of processing our bill.

Large portions, friendly service and great margaritas. You must get there before dinner rush or there will be people out the door! I go about 5:00. But no later! Leticia the owner is a sweetheart!",

I had the Quesa shrimp tacos and they were just really cheesy with no flavor. Did I tell you that at least the waiters were on point?  You Vegas Yelpers failed me again as usual..

    "text": "I've been here several times and have never found \"my dish\" that I always come back for (until this night).  I come back for the ambiance and to keep trying to find that one dish that makes me crave coming back.  Saturday we brought some out of town friends here for dinner.  Looking for somewhere they haven't been before we thought this was the place that wouldn't disappoint.    We were greeted by the hostess as soon as we walked in.  There were people waiting but we were seated right away.  The waiter came to take our drink order.  He was very friendly and offered up some recommendations.  He brought out the complimentary chips and salsa.  There was two types salsa - one smokey (not good) and the other was a tomato based salsa and was very tasty.  It also came with a warm bean dip which because a favorite of the table.  The chips were an \"eh\".  Nothing special and not even sure if they were freshly made but with the salsa/bean dip you didn't really notice.  We did order some of the freshly made guacamole.  It was pretty bland and was in need of salt, but I would rather put my own salt on guacamole anyway.  The BF and I both ordered the street tacos.  The waiter said they were what he usually ordered and so we thought we were good to go.  I ordered ground beef, chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas.  They were so good and I think I found my craving for this place.  It really was so much food though.  I only ate two and picked at the 3rd one.  It came with rice and beans and I only had a couple bites of rice.  I do love the rice here...its a no nonsense rice-tomato sauce and diced onion is my guess.  The BF and I also split a Mexican style corn on the cob (they cut it in half) that came topped with a white creamy cheese sauce and seasonings on top.  The corn itself had little cornels so it was just blah to me.  I might have to try this corn again because I'm not quite sure how I felt about it.  It was much different than I've had before.  The middle of our meal the owner stopped by our table to make sure everything was going good. I think he has done that every time we have been here.  I always appreciate an owner or even the manager that can take time to acknowledge their customers.  A simple effort but not many do it.  As our dinner started to wind down the karaoke crew started funneling in.  I had forgotten that they do karaoke on the weekends.  So we extended our drinks and our stay to watch some people strut their stuff.  I believe the starting time was 9pm.  Pretty smart to bring in a new crowd just as the dinner crowd is thinning out.  I hope it brings in some added business for them.  Really fun to kick back, catch up with friends with some good live music in the back ground.    Overall, the service is very personable and caring, the food is a delight, the ambiance is cozy and after 9pm on the weekends live karaoke lovin.  Score!",

The salsas that they bring out first were amazing. I loved it! The green salsa was pretty baller. When the fajitas came out I was excited but when I started digging into them I tasted oil and butter. I'm not a huge fan of buttery veggies and chicken. My taste buds aren't quite up to that. The flower tortillas weren't exactly my favorite either. Too cakey. Overall the chips and salsa that were brought out were the best thing for me. The rest, well let's say for a chubby man that never leaves food on his plate there was plenty left when I left.   I recommend swinging in for the salsas and if you like buttered down veggies.",

As a third generation Mexican American, I've had the privilege of growing up around the culture and experiencing some of the  most authentic of authentic cuisine on both sides of the US/Mexican Border.  I ordered the batter-less chile relleno stuffed with nicely seasoned shredded chicken. The beans and rice were fresh.  The 2 for 1 Margaritas were also  well appointed if you know what I mean.

    "text": "This place used to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the Valley, but I found another--- Juan's Flaming Fajitas(see my review). Anyways, more about Leticia's: the food is eclectic; however sometimes the basic ingredient of salt is missed and the food comes out a bit bland. The flavor aspect, especially from a Mexican restaurant is missing. Additionally, the prices are pretty exorbitantly high for the quality of taste that has dwindled over the years. Their Happy Hour makes me want to cry, *whispers* It's expensive, too! Honestly, I have come to the conclusion that Leticia's survives as well as it does partly because of it's location. It sits in an upper middle class neighborhood within the upper middle class part of NW Vegas. It's also the most authentic Mexican restaurant for miles---of anyone says Lindo Michoacan is authentic, I'm going to remind them of their cheesy and stereotypical atmosphere, their bland food and their salsa that tastes like a rip off of Heinz Ketchup. Also, I think Leticia's survives so well is also because of their puffy tacos and green salsa; yes, I'm dead serious. They have this amazing green citrusy/avocado salsa that craves the attention of most pregnant women, tacos lovers and salsa fanatics. Anyways, Leticia's will always have a place in my heart, especially because I live 2 minutes away not the NW Valley , but I will now drive 40 minutes to Juan's for my Mexican food infatuation",

You can essentially customize your own food here, from the salsa to the ingredients, and of course, the meat! My particular burrito was made with Al Pastor and Red Guajillo, Black Beans, and House Blend Cheese. This was a BEAST...had to take the other half to go! Really loved the salsa...it was actually a bit spicy!  I also liked the Queso Fundido : Chorizo, Gouda, and Menonita Cheese. Super cheesy mix, with tons of oil and fat...just like chorizo should be! It was almost too cheesy actually, with it being super stringy and a little difficult pulling apart! But that's what friends are for...to help you with your cheese!  Even the complimentary salsa and chips are great, and bottomless if you enjoy them as much as us!   Prices seem a bit steep at first, but the quality of ingredients, taste, and portions make it worth it.  Wish the portions were smaller with more reasonable prices to reflect that...ie a burrito at half the size, but around the $10 mark vs $15.  Took plenty of pics, check em out! :",

Today the clouds parted and the Sun shown down on my new favorite Pork Chop dish in Vegas. The Chuletas!  I was a little nervous as I am a bit particular when it comes to my Pork Chops but as soon as the waitress placed it in front of me and the intoxicating aroma hit my nose I had to fight the urge to dive right in and wait until my entire table was served.  Ooh the Humanity! The wait was killing me but once I started I couldn't stop. If it wasn't a business lunch and if I wasn't there with my colleagues I may have just ordered a second Pork Chop!  The chips salsa and refried bean appetizer was delicious but might not be touched on my next trip. Will want to save room for that Pork Chop.  Their salsa is a mild salsa with great flavor. For those looking for something a little more spicy ask for a habanero salsa dish to be brought out with the nachos. It was hot and had great fresh flavor. I couldn't tell if was from a can or not as my coworkers and I made that dish disappeared in less than five minutes but I'd guess freshly made.  The Staff was amazing and had a lot of personality as they interacted with my group of seven. One even went so far as to call me a Gringo for ordering flour tortillas. Was not expecting that and I played along making it an ongoing joke throughout the meal.  All in all I loved this place and can't wait till I have the opportunity to return!",

They offer outside seating as well as inside dining. The establishment itself is very clean and comfortable inside. They have a bar with gaming, but that does not take away from the full restaurant experience! I have visited Leticia's about 6 times since I moved to this area of town and every time I have had a wonderful experience. I'm a creature of habit, and tend to get the same things every time I go to a place. I love the build your own burrito! It's very filling and the portion size of everything here is giant! Everyone that I have brought with me to this establishment has loved it and ended up returning with their friends and families. I will definitely continue to come back here when I'm in the mood for good quality Mexican food!",

    "text": "Husband and I came here yesterday based on the reviews. The service was stellar! Received lots of attention and amazing service. I would give that 10 stars. The food, however was not so great. I ordered the fajita tamales, and my husband ordered the street tacos (not sure of the Spanish name). I specifically chose the tamales being that according to the menu, these were \"award winning\". I have to say, this is far from True for my dish. I couldn't finish it, and my husband, a human garbage disposal-took one bite and refused to finish it. It truly tasted like a can of old Campbell's soup wrapped in cheap masa! Yuck! The carne asada on hubby's tacos were so dry, that no amount of salsa or beans could have made it easier to swallow. I'm a pretty seasoned (well-traveled) foodie, and Mexican is one of my favorite cuisines. Flavors were totally off and disappointing. Although I appreciate the amazing service, I don't think we'll be making a trip back anytime soon.",

We took my niece there for dinner.  We got there a bit early so seating was no problem but when we left there seemed to be a wait.    Started off with their chips, bean dip and salsas.  LOVED the salsa verde.  My niece raved and she is 8!!  The beans and other salsa were just fine.  My niece ordered off the kids menu and had the chicken burrito (came with beans rice, a beverage and dessert).  She really liked the burrito.    My husband ordered the Latecia's Quesa Tacos which had a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese stuffed with shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce \"and topped with a chipotle cream sauce.  It came with a  small individual cheesy rice casserole  topped with crema and chile and a side of beans (he picked refried).  I stole that tasty little rice casserole right from under his nose!  I would come back for that and their grilled mexican corn on the cob!  That corn was super tasty!  I had their Taquitos dinner which gives you a good variety to choose from.  I chose the beef picadillo, chicken, and the most delectable  Potato and Cheese wrapped in  corn tortillas and fried crispy. All were topped with guacamole,  Oaxaca cheese, cotija cheese, crema and pico de gallo.  I had a side of black beans and cilantro rice.    Service was good and the decor was really nice.  Wished they were closer but they are worth  driving out to.",

Leticia's is our \"go-to\", primarily because of the fantastic drinks, fun atmosphere, clean restaurant, and friendly service. We've been here enough to know what we like to order, but I'm docking them a couple stars because we've had a few misses on our entrees over the years. The carnitas, carne asada, and generally anything on the family style menu have been delicious. Some of their other dishes, (such as the pork guisados) have been lacking in flavor, or overly greasy.  So, give Leticia's a shot, but ask your waiter for his or her recommendation.",

First ordered 2 black teas no lemon with extra splenda (yellow packets of sweetener) they bring all sweeteners but that one. AND two teas with 2 lemons in each. Okay. Shoulda just figured this is not going the way it normally does here.  Husband ordered fajitas with extra seasoning sauce they use. I ordered taquitos with no guacamole. Fajitas come no extra sauce. My taquitos have guacamole all over them. Husband eats his cause the three employees who came over had no idea what he was asking for. And I can't stand guacamole so I had to have mine redone. Well 27 minutes later they come out (way after hubby was done) I stopped one waiter at about 20 minutes and said just forget them I don't want them and they came anyway so I ate 2 of them and they're cold.. ask for the check. I really couldn't fathom they charged for mine. Honestly I wouldn't have asked for any discount cause we just don't do that but the fact they didn't offer or anything just put it like it didn't matter. I think we'll have to pass on our go to Mexican restaurant for quite a while. Seen a lot of new faces and maybe they changed management or something. We come every 2 weeks and it's on point usually but not now.  As of today 8/3/2018 we just found out there is a 3% charge to pay with a card. Smh.",

I checked Yelp before I came and saw that the happy hour goes from 6-7pm if you sit in the bar/lounge area (score!!). We were greeted by three people at the front immediately with smiles. Right of the bat, loved the decor and ambiance of this place. There was tons of Mexican-inspired artwork and the lighting was a nice mix between natural and dim (made for a romantic/chill vibe). Our server was quick and made sure we had everything we needed! He recommended the Peach Margarita, and I loved how it wasn't over powering with sweetness, but it was balanced enough that the tequila didn't hit me right away. You get complimentary chips and 3 salsas. I wish we got bigger chips, our bowl was mostly crumbs, but the salsa choices were awesome. Definitely something for everyone if you like spice, beans, or green chilies! My boyfriend got the Carne Asada plate. He said it was alright because he wanted more seasoning/spice, but he enjoyed the rice and beans. He said the rice tasted similar to his mom's! I ordered the Ensenada Street Tacos with grilled shrimp. I loved the spicy sauce and the crispness of the cabbage with the juicy shrimp. Definitely a flavorful bite. I'm pretty happy with my experience here and would recommend for a group lunch for some of my coworkers because they have so many different choices of entrees. I'd love to check out the happy hour menu too because the prices were so reasonable!",

I have a lot of food allergies and am not able to eat corn. They were able to accommodate my soft taco request by substituting the normal corn tortillas with flour! That was so nice. No extra charge and the food was amazing!   Parking is easy, menu is big, food is delicious.... and I can't wait to go back!  Great job guys!!",

It was dirty. A busted up wooden cabinet was by the door. Gang writing on the mirrors   The food is usually good. I ordered the shrimp ceviche. It's a total JOKE. I'm an honor graduate of Le Cordon Bleu.   Our server never touched the table. We would have ordered 2 more drinks each. We couldn't get anyone to take care of us.  Despite what appeared to me a excessive amount of staff milling about.   I discovered a break in occurred a few weeks ago. That explains the wood on the doors. Apparently they got into the safe. My opinion it's an inside job.   Sad to see a once great place deteriorate.",

    "text": "I've had take out here before but I finally got to dine in one night after finishing up what seemed like a very long and hard semester. Me and the beau wanted to celebrate so I suggested to come to Leticia's.  Located right off the freeway in the Centennial area, it reminded me of Tavoli Village actually. It was a very cute location and secluded. Upon walking in at 6pm it was pretty busy. We waited only about 20 minutes though. When you check in you receive a free house margareita so I took advantage of that. The beau got a guava jalapeno margareita. Oh that was delish!  Of course a red and green salsa and bean dip w/ chips came out. I always appreciate that because sometimes you just have the munchies as you wait for your food.  So I ordered ceviche with crab. oh my goodness, that was one of the best ceviches I ever had. The crab just made it extea amazing. It wasn't too sour because I hate when it is. It was the perfect amount. I had to order fresh guac of ocurse. Their guac is topped with a slice of queso which is apreciated also. You can also add crab on the guac, we didn't, but that sounds like a good idea! i love crab.  I got pork/beef pozole. I honeslty have had authentic home made pozole so in my mind I always compare it so Leticia's pozole didn't really cut it for me but the beau really liked it. It didn't have all the spices that I craved in it I dont know what was missing.   We also ordered carne, chicken, shrimp Molcajete. That was a lot of food. It was sooooo good! that is something I reccomend if you are dining with friends because that could be easily shared.   The waiter, I forgot his name, was amazing. He really helped us in information about the menu and ordering the right foods. He was awesome! everything came out in a reasonable time. We did order a lot of food for 2 so it was appreciated it did not come out all at once because we wouldn't have room on the table and that was all due to our waiter.   I ordered a CocoFlan to go because I was so full but I needed dessert for later. That was amazing. The chocolate cake was very moist and the flan wasn't too sweet. It was perfect.  Overall, it was a good dine in experience and I can not wait to return.",

Service starts with chips and salsa both a red and green along with refried beans for dipping. All three are  delicious and made fresh in house. The tortilla chips that accompanied  the salsas are also delicious.  Menu prices are a little high I feel but the portions and quality help to justify the price point. Daily specials that highlight traditional mexican home style dishes are very good. I had the Bisteque  and it was very good.  Tender beef with potatos, corn, peppers, and onions in a thick gravy like sauce was very good. I really enjoyed the white rice and beans. The white rice was prepared with sour cream and roasted peppers....Amazing!   One of the best parts of the meal was the free Margarita with the Yelp check in. It's always good to be a member of the club. Great beverage.   Enjoy!",

Ill be honest I'm not the most professional Mexican food critic because we have limited selection in Hawaii but truthfully the food was solid and very tasty.  The portions were generous and very filling.  Great place to get take out from for larger parties.   Only thing I wish was better is that for the amount of food we ordered they should have provided more chips and salsa. They only gave us a small sampling of their salsa I felt they should have been more generous with that.  Other than that the good was solid.",

The $12 greasy \"melted cheese\" appetizer was not worth the price. Most Mexican restaurants offer a small portion of queso, but we were told this wasn't possible.  The timeliness of our service was also disappointing. What really took the cake, was receiving my meal that apparently came with no sour cream...lettuce...pico...zero, zilch, notta!  I was charged  .50 for asking for a small dressing sized cup of sr cream.  My favorite part of all....was handing my card off to pay our $38 bill, to receive the receipt and my card ran for $43 because \"they forgot to add our drinks on before\". I'm sorry but you don't run someone's card for an amount other than their receipt shows, without permission! We brought friends in that were visiting from out of state, and raved to them about the food & service, before we were all disappointed. Not sure if we will be back. Leticia may have gotten too big for her britches.",

It almost seemed as there was 1 server for the whole restaurant. I was craving the Mexican corn. Now I've had this before, not here, but I was familiar with the taste. The corn arrived and looked amazing however the corn tasted as if it was sitting in a pot of boiling water. It was soggy and very watery.  The entrees were okay. I didn't order it but had a bite of the grilled shrimp cheese taco which is a must! Unfortunately I'm one of the few that will say I probably won't be returning. Not my favorite for Mexican food.",

I can't say that I've had one thing here I do not like but can tell you to get the happy hour nachos- best $3 ever spent. We have never had a problem with service, cleanliness, etc. Great place to go for a night out with a date or when you don't feel like cooking. Only took one star away as I usually don't mind dim lighting but have had LASIK and now to me it's a tad dark.",

The flavors are carefully crafted along with exceptional textures to create a symphony of Mexican perfection.  Especially impressive is pretty much any sauce.  I love the Picadillo.  My go to favorite dish is a battered Chile Relleno stuffed with Picadillo and enchilada sauce.  DIVINE!  The combination of the smoky ancho in the enchilada with the rich savory picadillo is wonderful.  My aunt always said you can judge a Mexican restaurant by the refried beans.  Leticia's passes this one with flying colors.  WOW.  chips and salsa is wonderful with 3 different awesome salsas.  And the margaritas...  THE MARGARITAS.  Go for a premium tequila.  You won't be disappointed.   Gracious service and a completely welcome atmosphere.  I had the pleasure of meeting Leticia briefly.  You can tell this is a passion for what she does and creating a great experience is her drive.  She does indeed succeed.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Some of the best Mexican food I've had. The cocina is located in a charming shopping center in North West Las Vegas with other eateries, shops, and businesses. The service here was good our server was a delight to talk to, and funny. My only complaint was maybe the service may have been just a tad on the slow side, so if your in a rush keep that in mind, not that I minded cause the chips and sauce just kept coming. When the main course gets to your table the first thing you'll notice is the aroma of cotija cheese, lots of cotija cheese. The taquitos, rice, and beans were wonderful, and to cap this scrumptious meal was a dish of their fried ice cream with chocolate sauce, this was simply incredible. All in all this is a great place for lunch and dinner, I can see this place being very crowded on a Friday or Saturday night so you may want to call ahead. Also I received word that their going to tack on a surcharge for debit or credit card use, so you may want to bring some dollars with you, we'll I hope this helps with your future lunch or dinner plans.",

The bar area also has TV's for watching a game and enjoying a meal if you're so inclined.    When I first sat down I was welcomed with chips that were still warm and toasty along with red and green sauces, and refried beans.  The lunch menu is a nice sampling of the dinner options and served with great proportions to be filling without overwhelming.  I had the Carnitas \"Ma Pita\" which was pork prepared in a way that I hadn't had since I was back home.  The spanish rice was warm, moist, and spiced with a nice tangy flavor.  The food was authentic and the service was attentive without being annoying and it was great to see a team effort of everyone helping your table and not just those that were assigned.

You can't go without having the Mexican corn on the cob. I don't know how he does it, but any time of year, they serve the most tender white corn with all the delicious street-vendor white sauce and cheese. I sometimes order two of these and soup - they make delish albondigas soup. Great chips and salsa, free of course. Wonderful fajitas and sopapillas too!",

The pop and lemonade tasted dirty. I sent back a total of three drinks and stuck with water. The chips and salsa were decent. I ordered beef and chicken fajitas. Beef tasted like teriyaki and the chicken was dry. Didn't really enjoy the overall taste of the beef and chicken combo. Most likely won't be going back.",

What a disappointment! DO NOT EAT HERE! The carnitas were bland, the tacos unbelievably salty, the taquitos were so over fried I could just about bite through them and the meat was dry and tasteless.... service was terrible - the waiter brought the wrong food... tell me, does \"TAQUITOS\" sound like \"FAJITAS\"???? Then by the time I actually got my taquitos the rest of my party was finished. What was offered to make up for this??? Oh, fried ice cream.. As if any of us wanted anything else fried. We ate outside. The table was filthy - chair were full of food crumbs - it looks like they have never washed the ground with a hose... people are banging into your chair as you eat to walk by...   This is truly THE WORST Mexican food I have ever eaten.... and I have eaten Mexican food in NJ and Hawaii - and even there it wasn't this bad! I don't know where the other people posting have eaten, or what their definition of good Mexican is - but you would do better at Taco Bell.   To add insult to injury, it is WAY over priced.... two street tacos were $13... three burnt, small taquitos also $13... save your time, your money, and your stomach and go elsewhere.  My husband, who has a cast iron stomach got sick and could wait to get home to run to the bathroom. Next day - he is still sick.  Food is certainly not fresh. Not tasty. Not cooked well. Service is sub-par. I honestly don't know how the place is still in business.",

I got the Mexican style Hamburguesa (because we just had mexican the night before!) and this was like a torta, but so tasty!  Not like a regular hamburger and big enough to share!

NOt sure, but its really really good, I would rate the food 5 stars, value 4 stars, location 1 star, unless you live up here in Canada Vegas, and 4 star service, 4 star atmosphere, so 4 stars...If I could give it a half star I would....give it a try...undalay undalay yee ba esa...esa..........OH, by the way, the drinks are 5 star!",

Chips and salsa took very long to arrive along with our extra bowl of bean dip that we had to ask twice for. My wife had the street tacos and I ordered the pozole. Her tacos came out lukewarm and she was very dissatisfied with the taste of rice and beans. My pozole was lukewarm as well when it arrived and i had asked for extra radishes when I had ordered and I received three pieces of a radish, seriously. They gave me about a tablespoon of cilantro and onions for my large bowl of soup, seriously. This is just being down right cheap not to mention that the radishes were dry. Now onto the fact that my water was only refilled once and I had to ask for that to be done. When refilled it had no ice so I was drinking warm water, I could have gotten colder water out of the tap. I honestly hate to post this because we have had good food from them before but it looks like that is a thing of the past. Oh yeah, they also overcharged us on our bill.

We asked for a table, after 10 minutes of her walking around in a circle she brought us to a booth. \"Oh you wanted a table?\" Not a good start.  Two of us ordered the fried whole tilapia, one ordered the special, a Mexican stew. After an hour of waiting, the waitress came and told us that there was only 1 whole tilapia in the kitchen. Couldn't she have told us that before? I ordered the cod special, instead, since there apparently wasn't enough tilapia.  After 2 total hours of waiting, the food comes out. The stew has burnt beef (black!), the whole fried fish is salty and old, and my other cod special that I ordered was so greasy I couldn't eat it. Our entrees also had this fried potato thing (unpeeled raw potato inside) and \"rice casserole\", (undercooked white rice mixed with cream cheese and spinach), both were appalling.   After a half-hour of \"negotiating\" with the manager, he took most of our bill off, and offered us free flan desert. OK flan, nothing special.  Overall, wasted 2 and a half hours, food was disgusting, and we left hungry. I've been here before and it was pretty good, but this was so bad, we are NEVER coming again.",

The house Magurita was reasonably priced and enjoyable to taste.  For my entre' I ordered the beef enchiladas and I thoroughly enjoyed them!  If you order a combo, be sure to ask for the white rice instead of the traditional Mexican rice with tomato sauce.  I have never had anything like it in my life.  It is delicious!

Now I'm kicking myself for all the wasted time and mediocre Mexican food we've put up with elsewhere.  I was a little worried about how crowded it might be for a Saturday night, but we were able to sit down at the bar without a problem and our wait time for a table was reasonable. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, and it never hurts to have the bartender card you when you're nearly 20 years beyond the drinking age.   The complimentary chips, salsas and bean dip were delicious. The food was good, though the only complaint I can come up with was not being able to find much of the guacamole in the enchilada I ordered. The shredded chicken was extremely tender if not a bit bland, but the lettuce and salsa on the plate were fresh and helped to pick things up a bit. The rice and beans (usually my favorite part of a Mexican dish), did not disappoint.   Unfortunately the portion size was so large that we didn't have room for the fried ice cream we had planned on getting, but that just means we need to go back again soon.",

The place itself and the area where the restaurant is located are both very cute. It's not a huge place, but the decor is really nice. The bar area does have gaming, and there is a separate restaurant side as well.  We sat down and were immediately brought water, chips, and 3 dip options: bean dip, a smoky mild salsa, and a very cilantro-y smooth guacamole. All were very good, and the chips were fresh. Our server Saul came to take our beverage order (2 Dos Equis), and then disappeared for at least ten minutes, if not 15. When he came back, he had no beer, ran to the bar, came back and said they were out of Dos Equis.... Not okay with that delay, or paying for the Pacifico that I didn't really want. Anyway, the service got a little better from here on out, except that when my mother ordered her chicken enchiladas, he tried to push a different style chicken on her, which was very awkward. I kind of interjected and said no, she's good... Very strange interaction.   I consider myself quite the connoisseur of cheese enchiladas, so of course this is what I ordered. They were very good, not the best I've had, but very good. The beans and rice that came with the enchiladas were great, extremely flavorful. My mom loved her shredded chicken enchiladas, and my dad loved his steak fajitas.  Loved the decor/restaurant itself, liked the food, and was unimpressed with the service.",

    "text": "Since this review was written I have returned to Leticia's and while the food remained delicious, the service is very inconsistent. I've had 5 star service at Leticia's.  Unfortunately, the last time I was there a larger party was seated next to us and we literally did not get any attention from our server again. Someone else dropped our food off at the table and we had to wait several minutes and then chase someone down to get our drinks refilled. Finally, we had to ask a busboy passing by for the check. Even though he had to approach our server in order to get the check, she still did not deliver it to us, apologize for the wait or say goodbye to the table. We were so disappointed.  Although my last experience was extremely bad, we had noticed on previous visits that the service was not always awesome. The failures in service and inconsistency are too much to deal with and I probably won't be returning to Leticia's for some time. I think it is very unfortunate because the food is just so good and we were so excited to find that restaurant nearby. I am updating this review in hopes that the management will realize that great food isn't worth much if it is delivered to the table cold, late and without a drink.",

    "text": "This is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have eaten here so often that this review won't scratch the surface.  Instead, I'll concentrate on the items I have eaten in the recent past: the Molcajete de Mariscos & Pastel de Tres Leches.  Molcajete de Mariscos, served spicy -  Lobster, clams, shrimp, mussels, & fish in a special sauce, white arroz poblano (rice, peppers, & cheese casserole ).  Served in a hot Molcajete (three-legged round bowl, which has been carved out of basalt).  The seafood was all perfectly cooked, the broth was spicy but not too hot.  The broth was flavored of roasted peppers, tomatoes, & seafood broth (not fishy).  The arroz served as a balance to the bold flavors of the broth but very tasty in its own right.  Something that impressed me was the white fish being flaky, the shellfish being tender, not rubbery, and the lobster meat being easy to pull out of tail, but not overcooked.  I highly recommend this dish  Pastel de Tres Leches - A very moist desert cake topped with citrus & whipped cream.  I am not a great lover of cake, but this is sublime.  Moist & flavorful, Leticia also infuses some type of cordial or liquor in the cake.  The flavor is creamy with a mild citrus flavor.  If you're a choc-o-holic, maybe you should look elsewhere, but, I consider this a great desert.  Standard Margarita - Buy them by the pitcher, on the rocks.  They put the ice in your glass and the pitcher remains un-diluted.  Every drink is good with their perfect proportions and better than average tequila.  The Cadillac Margarita is expensive, but excellent.  The only problem I ever have at Leticia's has been service.  Since I am a regular, that typically isn't a problem, so I may not be the best to assess their service.  Regardless, the staff is always warm & friendly with many regulars, and very friendly regulars at the bar.    Of special note: During warmer months on Mondays, street tacos are available in front, on the corner of Norman Rockwell & Farm Road.  Reduced price and, in my opinion, even better flavor.  On Saturday nights, after 8, there is karaoke in the bar area. Gustavo (restaurant partner) typically sings and gently cajoles the regulars into giving it a go. Very fun.   The restaurant itself is very clean and is in the location that was previously Joey's Seafood Only.  Parking is generous with street parking on Norman Rockwell and a well lit parking lot behind the restaurant.  That's all for now!",

This last time we dined in we had Lucian as our server. He is FANTASTIC! He was very courteous and polite and brought out our daughter's food first so she wasn't starving. He made sure our drinks were always filled and had extensive knowledge of the menu. We ordered the Nachitos Fritas as an appetizer and built our own burritos. Everything was perfect!! We couldn't finish everything so we got the rest of our burritos to go. I have to say it was just as good the second day!",

The house margaritas are awesome the chips and salsa are great and I love that you also get beans. The queso fondito with chorizo is amazing. I had the byo burrito and got shredded beef with beans, rice and cheese inside and the white cream sauce on the outside. The burrito was TO DIE FOR!!! Ahh that white cream sauce is so good. There was a bit of a wait on a Friday night but it was totally worth it. Oh and our waitress was the sweetest lady ever!",

Unlike other places. Food is reasonably priced and AWESOME. I'm also happy with the atmosphere, lightly dimmed and not too loud. We are able to talk at our table to each other and not have to yell. ;)  I will continue to go back and look forward to the great food and service!!",

But went this past weekend with my daughters and when they brought our food, rice/beans were a bit cold but the tacos were pretty warms all our plates.  I noticed the rice and beans was cooked and left for awhile in their pots. I'm a cook I know. So, you need to get your money's worth, my daughter paid for the dinner,  I am teaching her that your paying for this food, don't ever accept what it is.  Your a customer and food needs to be hot and cooked well.   So I asked the waiters about it and they were very understandable did take it back and gave us a whole new hot plate of food.  It looked fresh.  But there are no excuses to ever bring your customer a cold plate. I didn't get that.  That's my point. I hope that when I go there again it doesn't happen.  If it does I will walk out and not come back.  It's a shame because it's really a nice place to enjoy your food and great atmosphere.",

Today we came in for lunch, took a while before anyone came and got our drink order.

On top of that I never received any drink refills, despite the wait staff telling me they would bring a refill.

I ordered 2 tamales rice and beans dish for $10.89 my hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas rice and beans for $13.89 + a beer with tax and tip included came to $35, which was a little too high.  The meal itself wasn't too fresh or tasty. My tamale was a little too spicy and no taste, the rice was dry and looked like it was sitting around for hours under a heat lamp. The portion sizes of the sides were just not enough.  In a nutshell I don't mind paying good money for food, but this was definitely not worth it. I'm only giving this joint 3 stars because the service was friendly and the tamale was edible but that's all. If I ever come back I hope this place steps it up a bit.",

Chips and salsa to start- the green salsa was so good that we finished off two baskets of chips before our food even came out. Rib eye crispy tacos- comes with 2 for an entree. A little greasy but can be good hang over food. The rib eye was very tender and juicy. Yum all around Chipotle fajita tamales- Definitely get the green sauce. Good vegetarian option- filled with onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms.  OMG Churros! Sinfully sweet and coated with cinnamon sugar. Served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces on the side. Perfect way to end your Mexican fiesta meal.",

    "text": "I love the 3 complimentary salsas and their chips are awesome, super light and crispy.  We tried their fajitas for 2, which were tasty, but mostly veggies and less meat than the competition.  Guacamole was good, but they don't offer table side preparation.  Their Mexican corn was a fantastic little surprise that I never see on most other menus.  Whatever you do, DO NOT order a bloody mary here.  This was without a doubt the worst bloody mary I've ever ordered.  They politely agreed to swap me out for a beer when I explained the predicament.  I wouldn't be surprised if they get similar requests frequently.  The atmosphere is nice, the decor kinda looks like it used to be a Chili's or something like that.  We visited on a Sunday evening, and the place was hopping and fairly noisy.    Overall, this is a 3.5 star review.  There were some high points such as the salsas and menu variety, but the bloody mary, meat quantity in the fajitas, and no homemade tortillas left more to be desired.",

I've not had a single dish I've not liked. The quesadillas and guacamole are amazing.  We've done the build your own burritos and enchiladas a few times (both carinatas and carne asada) which were also great.  I've also had an amazing breakfast burrito and the best machaca ever at this spot.  Just great food.  Really good margaritas as well.   Service is always fast, friendly, and efficient. And the food is a good value with huge portions (easily two meals unless you're a REALLY big eater).  I just can't say enough good things about this place.  Try it!  You'll like it!",

We continue to try different things, but even a simple dish like the quesadilla with carnitas can be a great meal. It's an appetizer, but it's phenomenal.

The Eloite was a little overdone but tasty.  The guacamole was not good.  My husband loved his meal recommended by the waiter tampenqueno something (steak mushrooms onion and bacon).  I ordered a chili relleno stuffed with beef.  It was not battered apparently you have to ask for it to be battered.  I did not like it because it was not battered so the chiii was slimy and it was WAY WAY too much meat under it but the green sauce I asked for instead of the normal ranchero on top was amazing!!  Next time I will try a battered cheese stuffed relleno",

Their carnitas, fish tacos, chile relleno, and buritos are some of the best you will find in the Las Vegas area.  Their chips and salsa are also decent.  The atmosphere is very nice and the decor has a warm and friendly feel.  Although I've occasionally had less than stellar service, it is usually very good.

There was only 2 other people up there and the bartender acknowledge us right away and said he would be right with us.  Drinks were served fast and once we figured out want we wanted to eat, our order was taken promptly.  While we were sitting waiting, the bartender was nice and chatting with us.  Definitely makes sitting at the bar a plus.  My friend said he would come back just to sit at the bar and hang out with him.  The food, I ordered carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  The carne asada was so yummy with great flavor.  It only had onions and cilantro on top and that was really all I needed.  My friend had a chicken burrito, enchilada style and after one bite he was all about it.  He cleaned is plate!  I will definitely come back now that I have had better experience!",

Going inside its decorated how my dream kitchen is (style wise). We were seated in \"Lucian's \" section. He seems bothered by all of the customers demands & months of unfamiliarity with \"mexican\" food. I ask what he recommends he points out three of the highest priced plates. I choose the \"Quesa Tacos\" - I get something saucy w meat inside two cold unfresh corn tortillas - the beans were Eh (maybe canned!)The rice was white rice w green chiles & hot sour cream or something creamy (I dunno) Kids meal had cold limp fries that maybe were fresh cut in house at one point- not tonight- the chicken fingers appeared hand made. My man had a wet burrito it was a good size for 13.00 Chips weren't warm like another review said they would be-they had a cold styrofoam texture & salsa being chipotle not my thing but tasted cool. was 55.00 for 2+kid Tacos & burrito... Burnt out server Rest of staff was nice. BOTTOM LINE: Mar Y Tierra = Authentic non-Americanized w the best salsa & chips & Coctel de Cameron & carne Asada !!! For 35-40$ there we would Eat like Kings(& Reynas)!!",

I literally started calling an hour and a half before I wanted to arrive because it was my Fathers birthday so I wouldn't have to wait and I ended up waiting for 20 minutes anyway. She said sorry but she didn't do anything else. When I was finally seated there were no place setting or silverware. I asked for the queso, in which the waiter told us they were out of queso. Seriously, how does a Mexican restaurant run out of queso?! It was honestly just an annoying experience and not how I wanted to celebrate my fathers birthday. The food is good but the service ruined it for me.",

As we walked in, we noticed two other parties in the dining room; the place was not busy.    We sat down, ordered our food, and waited.....waited....waited....  The entire time the manager (I think) was gabbing with the waitstaff about nothing important, right next to our table.  We were pretty much ignored throughout the meal.  The waitress brought out two scalding hot cups of soup, literally seconds before our entrees arrived.  On top of that, she placed the soups directly in front of our 4 and 5 year old eaters.  Common sense isn't always so common.    I mentioned the poor service to the manager, who just said, \"Sorry,\" and carried on chatting with his waitresses.    The food was bland at best.  I know I\"m only giving a little attention to the food here, but probably just as much attention as the cooks gave it in the first place.",

I don't eat a  lot so I think it's great that you can order Tequizas (not the cheesy beer, it's their Mexican street tacos). Reminds me of the tacos I could get when I hopped over to Tijuana when I Iived in SD. They're only about 1.75 each. 3 is enough for me. The carnitas & rib eye tacos are the best. I had the grilled fish tacos but I wasn't a big fan - I didn't like the sauce they put on top of it.   Don't forget to check in onYelp! You ge a free fried ice cream which is delicious! I'm so glad there is a decent authenic Mexican restaurant in Centennial Hills. I think this is the best Mexican restaurant I've tried in Las Vegas.",

When we told the waiter, the waiter said \"Well don't you even want to taste it?\" NO! we just want what we ordered to begin with. Their red sauce tastes like a mild mole sauce, which was not all that good. I ordered a taco and it was pretty good, but beans and rice were cold.

No problem, they took my phone number so they could text when the table was ready. We were four with a high chair. I specifically mentioned we'd need a high chair. Around 30 minutes later I received the text our table was ready. This is when it all started to go wrong. The hostess was ready to seat us and then says 'oh you need a high chair'. Apparently the table we were supposed to get would not accomodate a high chair or it would have been in the way. So they would get us another table.  15 minutes later we're still waiting. I took my son to the bathroom and noticed a large party had just left and the staff was pulling apart the 3 tables they had used. I figured that one of those would be for us; the space looked perfect to fit the high chair. But no, they took two of the tables and put them together with some others to seat another large party that had arrived after us! After another 10 minutes they  finally seated us at a two top booth that they added a two top table to. It was squished and awkward. Sitting there for almost 10 minutes we still had not been greeted, had no chips and salsa and no drinks. Finally a busboy brought the chips etc and asked if we wanted something to drink. I tried to order a margarita but he said her could only bring water.    Our server finally showed up asking if we'd been helped yet. He said since no one had helped us he would. He also said it was shift change time, trying to explain, we assumed, about the wait time. However since it was now 4:15 and the place closes at 9 we figured that was bs. We gave him our food and drink order right away.  The drinks were brought out then another 15, 20, 25 minutes goes by with nada. My husband had to go to work soon and we had no idea the experience would be so time consuming. We were literally rising from our seats to leave when the food showed up. The food was good but not spectacular. Between the high prices and the piss poor service we were hoping for something better food wise. At one point my husband talked to the manager about the situation. She was flustered and nervous and simply did not know how to handle the complaint. Over all her attitude was 'oh well', (shrug). No offers to comp anything, not my kid's meal or even my margarita. No attempt whatsoever was made to assuage the situation. After we finished eating we sat and waited some more and then had to ask for our check. We chose to go there because of the good reviews and high stars. But after a closer review I've noticed many other reviewers have had similar complaints. Needless to say, we will not return, we will not recommend, and we will let others know not to bother with this restaurant.",

It was also slightly hard to communicate to the servers and others at the table because the music was very loud. A member of m group order the soup and he said it came out room temperature. He asked for it to be warned up which I'm sure just involved a microwave. I order the enchilada teqitos  which were very tasty.

I love the Shrimp Ala Diabla, the Steak Salad (dinner portion of course), carne asada enchilada and I never fail to order the  chicken consome. I eat in different Mexican restaurant but being close to work, I make sure I stop by here before heading home of break for lunch whenever I crave for the taste. Great food, Great Service!!!",

That is rare so I was impressed! The beans...however just weren't that good... I even tried to salt them... Still not a fan.  The chips at the beginning are fresh and the bean dip...not that great... The 2 salsas they were ok...I've had better. I mentioned check in on yelp...got a free fried ice cream... Now that was Good! I will definitely return...with friends.",

I have found a Mexican joint with good food AND good salsa.  Salsa here includes a fire-roasted chipotle salsa, green salsa and bean dip.  Ended up here on a Saturday night.  Pretty crowded, which is always a good sign.  Nice lighting, cute little area.  This is a great date spot.  Our server Luciano was great, service was prompt and most importantly, the food was really good.  Although I ate so much of the salsa that I barely touched my shrimp tacos, they had a spicy creamy chipotle sauce which was awesome.",

This place is really good the flautas where amazing and the beans and rice are authentic only drawbacks are the non traditional chips which are not that good and our server only came around once to check on us. And if your Mexican the lack of real Mexican music might piss you off lol no mariachi, banda or norteno only rock en Espanol from south America, it's like if you go to a bbq joint and there playing Techno it's just not the right music lol",

I don't know if she was new or just doesn't know the menu. She brought my daughter the wrong sauce then tried to lie that is was the correct one. We have been dinning there for 3years always order the same thing I guess it changed over night. I guess over night drinks are no longer included in the kids meal. Normally a kids cup of fideo is .50 but today Gladys charged us $3. She forgot to even order my other daughters food.  Initially took 10minutes just to acknowledge we where even sitting there. I know helping a mom with three kids is every servers worst nightmare, but my kids go there often and are well behaved. I hope our next visit will be with a better server.",

We asked him for To-go boxes and he became annoyed because we asked for one that the taquitos fit in as he brought us a bowl for them. We asked for a cup for my moms tea and he rudely said \"you can't put your margarita in there\" we said it's for our tea. When he came back he physically reached over the table to grab the cup out of my moms hand, then all a sudden he spoke English. We said it's tea, he then walked away and started muttering words to other servers about us and then stared me down as we walked out the door. If, if I went there again I'd demand another server besides him. He's very bad for your business.",

We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.  I was so pleased with the \"Happy Hour Menu\". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the \"Cheese Quesadilla\" and \"Chorizo Taco\". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.  I tried the \"Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos\" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.  The \"Fried Ice Cream\" is very yummy!  My experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same. Excellent.  I wanted to update my review to let others know about the happy hour menu and the quality and consistency of Leticia's.",

Today, however, closed the deal for me not to give this restaurant my business. We wanted to celebrate a going away party so I called for a reservation for 10. The hostess was ok but from the get go gave me the impression that she was not happy with reserving for a party that size. After putting me on hold and asking the manager she told me that they would have to have a $150 deposit which would be not refunded if I do not cancel at least 2 hours earlier or if at least 75% of my party doesn't show up. That would mean that if 2 people cancel last minute, not only they would get the revenue of 7 people, but they would get an extra $150. Since when are local restaurants turning into airlines??  Regardless I said ok here is my Amex and exp, but then they wanted my security code. Say what??? For a reservation guarantee?  I told them that if they are adamant about getting my code I will take my business elsewhere and their answer was ok, I am sorry.  Too bad, the food was good.",

I really wanted to try their famous \"queso tacos\" since I am such a big cheese fan, however, I found them too expensive. I have to admit, the food was pretty good and flavorful. I got the shrimp empanadas. I thought they were also very tasty, I didn't care for the ground beef that was mixed in. Leticia's has really good lunch specials, too. However, if I had to compare it to other sit-down Mexican restaurants, the others server larger portions. I also would appreciate it if they can update their menu, which I see that there are rather an array of mistakes/consistencies. Overall, I would still come back, mainly because I see potential in the queso tacos which I am still curious about. As far as the service, I'd give it a 10/10. The servers are super friendly and attentive.",

About 30 minutes later the bartender finally got our drinks to us. Another 10 minutes we noticed tables clearing out and no line at the door. My husband went to the hostess to find out if we could get a table yet. They totally forgot about us! Our server was just as bad and should not be in the food service industry. We tried to give her a pass since she seemed to be in pain and have neck problems. It was difficult getting her to come over for a drink refill or even come back to the table but she was sure busy on her phone. Food was mediocre. Hopefully they were all just having an off night not sure if we will come back. We certainly won't recommend them anymore!",

There were 3 of us dining and 1 had the Milanese Chicken, which was absolutely horrible and almost inedible. The chicken was pounded so thin and pan seared that it was like a dried piece of chicken jerky.  The carne asada burrito was just okay (Cafe Rio is better and cheaper). I had the Taquito's, the potato and cheese was the only good thing about my dinner, the chicken taquito and the beef were both very dry and the meat was tough. Not including the tip dinner was over $60 (only 1 beer).  I would only go back for the potato and cheese taquitos.",

Finally the other evening I have really had enough bad food. I have sent back a simple burrito because the meat smelled funny.     \"Only to be told that it is the broth they cook it in\" My food has been cold over and over again. The most recent experience is I was given a incorrect meal after waiting a very long time for it to arrive.  During our wait our water glasses were not filled and we were not given any extra chips. I asked to speak to manager who basically told me that there  would be no charge for my meal but my son's meal was still being charged \"$20.00 for a build your own burrito\". So I waited for him to eat. It was a horrible experience once again. Anyone considering going to Leticia's please look for another place to go. I am not a one time customer who had a bad experience. I am a returning customer who has always had a bad experience.",

You know when you go somewhere and the food doesn't live up to the hype? This was NOT that kind of place. The food was SO good. I have been let down by many Mexican restaurants, but the flavors here were the bomb. I got the Molcajete which is served in a giant, sizzling bowl with your choice of meat(s), ranchera sauce, grilled cactus, and a side of tortillas, rice, beans, etc. Basically, it's like fajitas. The ranchera was a little spicier than I was expecting, but still delicious. Our server was Mario. He was personable and kept our drinks filled. My only disappointment was that they were out of Mole sauce, which is my favorite and what I originally wanted, but that forced me to branch out and try something new. I will definitely be back!",

This was strange as they customarily bring new before you are out... They refused to bring more and basically ignored us.

Some reviewers say the chips are nothing special but they were delicious. Just salty enough and a little thicker than the standard chips. The salsas were pretty good but the bean dip stood out the most. We also ordered a small guac which was huge and it was so good. You can get a side of jalepenos to mix in yourself.   The horchata was super fresh tasting if you like that. I personally like the less authentic manufactured ones but this was also good.   The service here is great. Our server actually recommended the smaller guac when we were gonna order the large.   Bad:   The rice and beans were not that good, which is the case at most Mexican places. I've had authentic rice and beans an leticias dry flavorless rice was pretty bad. The beans tasted no different from canned retried beans.   While we both enjoyed our entrees, thy were nothing special. I had the fish tacos. The sauce was good but the fish did not taste good. There was too much lettuce and cheese. My girlfriend had beef tamales. Everything was good but the enchilada style sauce.   Overall we enjoyed this place and look forward to go back to try other menu items.",

Asked the waitress for extra sauce for my wet burrito, because it was pretty dry when it came to the table. Apparently, the waitress forgot because we never got the extra sauce. And to top it all off, our glasses went empty a couple of times and we had to request refills. Disappointing, to say the least:(",

We were a party of two and The \"host\" told us it would be a minute or so, then another party of two comes in and he goes to seat them right away... It wasn't until I spoke up that he then sat us first. Then to make a really long bad experience short, we waited over an hour for appetizers and then was overcharged! When I pointed it out to the \"waitress/bartender\" she first tried saying its because I got a filling in my taquitos! Really? Because the menu states choice of filling for $6.89, she then said its a glitch in the register system! Whatever, I'll stick with Viva Mercados!",

On multiple occasions they have been out of simple things like bottled water... or a liquor behind the bar.  Items on the daily menu go unavail for days. I have spent many evenings at the bar plugging money  in the video poker machines and enjoying the company of their amazing bartenders(Justin and Liz) . My husband is a fan of many of their dishes or should I say was a fan until here  recently hes complained that the food isnt the same.  Sadly somethings gone terribly wrong we truly hope the management gets the kitchen back in order otherwise the only reason patrons like us will visit is to say hi to the staff and pray they will have our drink- Not a fan of Mexican gourmet but once upon a time I would have recommended. For now we are in search of good mexican food...  Too bad because we live so so close.",

When talking with the server, she offered to substitute sauteed veggies for meat in dishes, which opened up the options for me as a vegetarian.  I ordered a very delicious burrito!  We dined outside and enjoyed ourselves.  I imagine that we will be back soon.    Original: I have visited this place twice: once with my husband and once with a large party.  During the first visit, the staff was knowledgeable and helpful.  The server was friendly but didn't have it together with my later visit.  There are no vegetarian entrees on the menu -- you have to create your own if you want to eat without meat.  The people I was with who had meat entrees loved their food.  I did not like their red enchilada sauce.  It tasted terrible and ruined my dish.  The rice and beans were good.  My food was just average.  I would have rather gone to a lower end Mexican restaurant and had more vegetarian options and tastier food.  The server forgot one person's dish completely in our large party.  She asked about it, and the server had forgotten to put it in.  When we got the individual bills, they were all wrong and people's drinks and food were mixed up and not on the right bills.  We ended up just figuring it out amongst ourselves since the server wasn't very competent.",

Well, there is a place in Wichita Falls, TX, called Casa Manana, which has delicious food (even if it didn't always agree with me the next day), but Leticia's is even better than that place, and never disagrees with me!    Everything at Leticia's is freshly prepared (no canned ingredients, apparently).  It is apparent that the chef/owner cares a great deal about what ends up on our plates.  My husband isn't a huge fan of Mexican food, but he loves Leticia's!  The food is great and in huge portions so I often have the next day's lunch as well.  The drinks are great.  The service is great.  I love this place and can't recommend it enough!   Leticia's es la Bomba!!",

    "text": "Second review:  I had to give this one another shot due to the carnitas being so good, but this will be my last time going there. Food is good so I can't knock them on that, but the service by Saul is some of the worst. I've been in the restaurant business for over 20 years and this guy might be one of the worst servers I have ever encountered. He is a disgrace to people in the industry. All he does is smile like an idiot to your face, because he is clearly overwhelmed all of the time. He went from a buss boy to a server which was a poor decision on behalf of management, but even worse is that they keep him in a position that he will never succeed at. What makes me most upset about this place is the lack of management or ownership presence. The restaurant appears to always be busy, and it's because it takes and hour and a half for a three top to get entrees only. Pathetic!   They truly need the help of a good consultant to go in and show them how to be operators of their business since it's clear that they are not capable of managing this place themselves. It is currently doing good volume, but if another place in the area opens up that is decent I don't think this place will make it which is sad. The lack of ownership presence on the floor shows they have no respect or appreciation for the customer. Good restauranteurs are involved in their business during peak times so they can evaluate what the business needs to improve on. It's clear they aren't watching their social media reviews which are done by customers taking time out of their busy day to tell them either what they are doing well or what they need to improve on. 7-12-16  Update: After this review was posted the GM emailed me with a response to how things were handled. I appreciate the fact that they take reviews seriously, and the importance of customer feedback. Great job! I had to raise my review from a 1 star to  a four star, because they do have great food and that's the reason most people go out to eat.   First review: I frequent this place a couple times per month because the carnitas are very good.  My last few experiences have been less than stellar. Customer service has fallen off drastically, and there is no management presence so the staff does whatever they want. Nobody has ever come back to ask how everything is and if they can get anything else before they bring the bill. The last time I was in which was yesterday the very inexperienced server rang in both orders incorrectly and when we finally had to track him down it took another 25 minutes to get one carnitas taco. How it takes 25 minutes to put pre cooked meat on a flour tortilla with some onion and cilantro is mind blowing. There was no manager to complain to. It took an hour and a half for two people to eat which makes it clear why it always looks busy in there because they don't turn tables very fast.  GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!",

Margarita barely drinkable, Lady at table next to us had return 3 before they got it right...even the waiter agreed.  When ordering, I was asking him what was on the menu, and we were learning together.  The chile rellenos come with a meat inside that has raisins in it if you don't read the entire description. They do give option for cheese. I had their award winning shrimp dish under the entrees, I think it may have had 3 bay shrimp between the 2 enchiladas (sauce was good) a small scoop of beans and rice,cheese, chili \"casserole\" for the rice which would have been good except it was cold. We were seated  at 6:15, served barely edible food around 7:25, and finally got our bill and out of there at 8:25.  For what you get, way over-priced.  The waiter was entertaining and service was good.  Think he and busboy were scared to come back to the table after a while.  Recommend waiting until every one knows menu and how to cook it.",

It's located on a cool little street that I didn't know existed. It has a nice atmosphere and I bet it would be a neat place to take a stroll at night.   The service was just average, even a bit slow at times. Nice enough but it took longer than expected for condiments and few other items to show up at our table after the food arrived. I had the empanada lunch special with grilled shrimp. At $9 it was a reasonable portion, served with rice and beans. It was crazy heavy on the onions. I like onion for sure, but I couldn't taste anything else. The onion overwhelmed all the other flavors in the dish. Rice and beans were pretty standard, nothing to brag about.   I also tried the shrimp a la diabla. It was much better than my own meal. Nice and spicy with a good amount of tiger prawns. I didn't try a margarita, perhaps it's the star of the show? With all the good reviews and the cool atmosphere I'll come back next time I'm in the area. I'd like to try the happy hour or dinner and have a few other menu items. This spot seems to have lots of potential. I just won't do the empanada on my next go.",

A little more time in between would have been better. A good waiter(ess) should be able to judge their table and know how often is too much.  We started with guacamole and it was alright. My girlfriend had raved on and on about it so when we got it, she wasn't that far off.  I went with a chicken finger meal for my son. The chicken fingers were made fresh with their own batter. They came out hot, fresh and crispy with plenty of french fries.  I went with a fish taco and rice. There was plenty of fish on my tacos and they were super delish and yummy. I was really surprised by how much I loved them.   My girlfriend ordered a chimichanga which she shared and boy oh boy, was that sucker huge. It was filled with lots of meat and cheese.

    "text": "So, this is just a review of the meal I had. I was a lazy ass and had postmates bring it to me (insert Jabba the Hutt laughter) So, while I've heard great things about this place, I have only eaten their food at home.         We were NOT disappointed. The food arrived and was brought to me where I could chow down in my pajamas like the fancy lady I am. I had the beef taquitos, and they were delicious. As well as the chicken fajitas which were amazing, their homemade tortillas were perfection. There was plenty of pico and guac to go around, they don't skimp on the sauces. I also had their chicharrones (which weren't my favorite, but that was my fault for not reading the description better. When I went back and re-read I realized I had made a mistake, a hunger-crazed mistake.)         All in all we really enjoyed the food and can't wait to go to the actual restaurant to get some more. As soon as I stop being lazy.",

I was not disappointed, from the warm, prompt greeting upon entrance to the restaurant.. next were the fresh chips n salsa/green, tomatillo base salsa and another rojo sauce tasted; fire roasted and beans w a hint of chorizo mixed in for flavor arriving shortly after sitting down and getting situated..wow, were already off to an excellent start.. The flavor of the meat and veggies was really good with the vegetables still having a slightly crisp texture and not mushy as sometimes they can get when not done right.. definitely be back to try more items from the elaborate menu!",

    "text": "I had heard about Leticia's and had driven past it a few times while doing other things. When the Mrs. and I were discussing lunch plans on a Sunday afternoon, mexican food was mentioned and we were off to \"that mexican place right down the street.\" The atmosphere was great and we were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess. We were seated in an area near, but away from, the bar. Chips were on the table almost simulatneoulsy with us sitting down with three different types of \"dip\" to induldge in. The bean dip was outstanding. Great flavor with whole pinto beans, along with a mixture of the standard consistency of bean dip. The bean dip was accompanied by a red sauce and a green tomatillo sauce. Both were very good and full of flavor.  We ordered their mexican style corn as an appetizer. Corn on the cob, grilled to perfection and covered with crumbled bits of cotija cheese, melted butter and thick creamy mexican cream. This is a must have. I would have been satisfied just powering through these for lunch. I chose carne asada tacos for the entree. You have the option of hard, soft or \"puffy\" tortillas. The waitress was more than happy to allow me a different type of tortilla on each taco. I opted for soft and \"puffy.\" Both were great and I would describe the \"puffy\" as kind of like the torilla bowl you would expect to get a taco salad in. The carne asada was thee best I have had in Vegas. It was tender and juicy with plenty of spice and flavor.  The Mrs. chose the \"hamburgesa.\" You may be asking yourself \"why would she order a hamburger at a mexican food joint?\" One bite and you just might say \"this is the best hamburgesa I've ever had.\" I have had hamburgers at mexican restaurants before that are obviously just on the menu to satisfy someone who didn't want mexican but went along with the crowd. or was coerced by family or friends. This was anything other than your standard hamburger. The patty was handmade and seasoned to perfection. It comes on a torta style bun, complete with tomato, bacon and avocado. The french fries were crinkle style and mighty tasty.   The menu says if you check-in on Yelp and show the waiter/waitress, you will get a free dessert. We couldn't take advantage of this, as we were stuffed and in the beginning stages of our food comas. Although nobody was seated at the bar yet, it did look like pretty cool place to hang out, catch a game on the TV and enjoy your favorite libation.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back to work my way through a menu that includes \"Baja Style Fish Tacos\", \"Rib Eye Tacos\" and \"Carne Asada Nachos.\"",

There were multiple great reviews so we were looking forward to trying it out.   The vibe we got coming in set the tone. We did not feel welcome. Our service felt like they thought we were a waste of time, certainly not as a guest.   We asked for one slight change to a menu item and that was flatly refused.   Asked for some more chips and they took forever to do that, and tossed at us.   Finally got our food, and it was pretty tasteless.   The TV report saying they hid the \"C\" rating card, pretty much reflects my experience with them.   The food and service were enough for us never trying it again. The volume of health violations are the capper.",

    "text": "After hearing so many positive reviews from friends about how amazing the food was, we decided to give it a try. The outside is absolutely adorable and looks like a welcoming place to dine. The inside isn't huge but it's cute. I liked that you can watch them make tortillas!   We sat down and browsed the menu, everything sounded yummy. It took 15 mins before anyone came over to take our drink order. They brought chips and 3 different salsas! The salsa verde was amazing!!!!! That was my all time favorite, right amount of spice but tons of flavor!! The red salsa was also yummy but I am partial to the verde salsa! Finally a busboy took our drink order and then 10 mins later our waiter came by to take our order.   I decided to give the lunch combo a try which was an enchilada, taco and a bowl of fideo soup. I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco. They give you the option of red or green enchilada sauce. Everything came and looked amazing and smelled even better. Sadly that was not the case. My enchilada was warm, not hot,so you didn't get that yummy, cheesy feel when you cut into it. The red sauce was spicy which I didn't mind but it had a grainy type feel to it which was a big turn off. The chicken taco was AMAZING though. The tortilla was fried perfectly, the chicken was tender, the lettuce had a nice crunch. Just all around yummy! I loved that they didn't smash the beans for the refried beans, it was yummy with the whole pinto beans. The rice was also really good! They had the best fried ice cream also! Omg weakness for me is fried ice cream!   Would I come back? Probably but I will order something different except for the fried ice cream because that was heaven!!",

Miguel was our waiter, we was very friendly and outgoing. He was overwhelmed with the dining area because it seems that he was the only waiter there.  We were the very first customers to arrive today and once more ppl arrived it was almost impossible to leave. We waited 15 minutes before we were able to catch Miguel to get our check. Someone else picked our plates up 15 minutes prior to us being able to get the check.   Food wasn't all that great, everything had a smoky flavor. My carne asada was super dry and was hardly warm, the taste was smoky and salty. The rice was delicious soft and fluffy but beans were salty.   Chips were good but also very salty. The verde salsa is tasty but has a lot of cilantro in it. The red salsa was very smoky as well. The bean dip was good but wasn't all that hot.   The atmosphere was comfortable and the decorations were beautiful. The facility is very clean considering we found cockroaches outside.",

The buss boy was right away to the table and bring some complimentary chips and 3 different salsa. That was a great start since the salsa and the chips were delicious.  The server was the Bartender \"Morri\". He was very nice and definitely acted like a bartender not a server. I usually eat alone and love to eat the bar since bartender are not use to serve food and are always happy to get a larger tip than the couple bucks for cocktail they get. Unfortunately this time it looks like Morri had not idea about food or the menu. When I inquiry about vegetarian or vegan, he had no idea what I was talking about and offer me some shrimp and chicken items. After looking at the menu I decided to go for the \"Spinach and Mushrooms Enchilada $15 (add Veggies for $2). The dish was excellent! I am not sure why I had some Veggies since they were almost inexistent in the enchiladas.But one more time it was absolutely delicious and I will not hesitate to come back to have it again. Just for info, I leave close by to the one in Tivoli village and I choose to drive 16 miles due to the review on Yelp.  I am sure Morri is an excellent Bartender but if management decide to give him some table, maybe they need to train him especially if he is going to type the \"add veggie button\" at 2.89 instead of $2.",

Our waiter was very professional and the other guys helping him were very courteous and made sure we had everything we needed.  Food was delivered in a timely manner and they did a nice job singing to my brother in law for his birthday.  The food was just ok.  The chips and salsa were good.  I did like that they gave you three choices of salsa.  Hubby and I shared some albodigas soup.  It was ok.  Not a lot of veggies, but a pretty decent amount of meatballs.  I ordered the carne asada which was really thin and a little tough to cut.  I'm glad it came with pico, quac, and half a jalapeno.  The rice and beans were ok, but I've had better.  The tortillas were good, but not the best I've ever had.    Overall I think the service is outstanding, but the food is just ok.  I think it's a great if you are craving decent Mexican food and you are in this part of town, unfortunately hubby and I don't come this far north, so not sure how often we would be back.",

    "text": "It's very off putting to see a restaurant with the volume of clientele be so petty to charge 3% for credit card transactions. Most people don't carry cash in a regular basis.  Especially when they don't know how much their bill might be.   I own a small business as well. Yes, we do charge a convenience fee for credit card payment. But our business transactions in 1 months probably doesn't even come close to their daily charges. Unfortunately for small businesses who have very little profit, it's necessary. But for the volume this restaurant does daily, is just petty. I'm quite certain their wholesale cost isn't $15 for the ingredients. There's plenty of profit from the food to cover it.   Since we never carry cash in us, we won't be back for long waits and greed.",

Fresh chunks of cheese and avocado in it. Chicken chucks were great too (not chewy or over done). Meal came w free chips and 3 sauces. Sadly the \"Salas\" were just ehhhhha?! The green one takes like chewing on a pine tree... oddly! The bean dip was great!!  I used the coupon yelp gave for a free margarita and they still charged me (manager did fix but upsetting I had to point out the error).

    "text": "I really hate to leave bad reviews. I only leave them when my experience has been very negative. And what makes it worse is that I wanted to love this place.  If you're like me, you've lived in places where there is REALLY good Mexican food. You've tried to find it in Vegas and failed.   I'm always optimistic about trying new Mexican food, especially when there are good reviews. Leticia's is super cute, and it was super busy this Friday evening. I was excited and, like I said, I wanted to love it.  The wait was 30 minutes, which was fine. The hostesses were actually a bit ahead of schedule, so I was pleased initially. The problems began when we were seated. It took 10 minutes for our server to come over. It took another 5 or more to get beverages. The iced tea was so bad (it's that taste you get when they need to clean their iced tea maker - kind of briney or something) that I sent it back. And that took forever...  I had to flag the server down to order, as we had been waiting about 20 minutes just to get our order placed. When the food arrived, we were disappointed. The flavors were just \"meh,\" and the tortillas on the enchiladas were so hard that they could not be cut with a fork. I will say that the chips and salsas were decent, though.  I SO wanted to find something good about Leticia's that I ordered dessert. Flan. One of my faves. I LOVE flan when it's done right. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was thick, gluey, and not very flavorful. Good flan should have a creamy texture to it and not an overpowering sauce to cover up the weak taste.  Even after all of this, I would not have been compelled to write a negative review. I simply wouldn't have returned. It's what happened next that put me over the edge. The server brought the check for something like $38.43. Great, perfect. I gave him my card, and he brought it back with a charge of something like $39.68. It wasn't a big deal, but I did point out the discrepancy. The server then tells me that they are adding a 3% surcharge to credit or debit cards.  This 3% charge was not disclosed to me at any time. Had it been, I could have paid cash. I actually had cash on me for once! I think it should have been disclosed prior to the 30 minute wait time quote so I could have made an informed decision as to whether I wanted to patronize this establishment. Rinky-dink retailers and restaurants that can't manage their overhead and/or profitability do that sort of thing. I thought this was a REAL restaurant! But the main issue is that I didn't understand this would happen. To bring the charge slip back with a different amount than the bill is unacceptable in my world.  I ended up talking with the manager, who blamed it on their POS system (and this isn't True, folks - that was a dishonest move). He also brought over a table tent that said you get a 3% discount if you pay cash. Conveniently, our table did not have this tent until he scrounged it up. Did you notice what I said, by the way? The table tent, which I photographed, said a 3% discount was offered for cash payments. They actually charged me an additional 3%. That's not what the table tent said...  Like I said, if it had been just bad food and service, I would have written it off and never gone back. But the dishonesty and non-disclosure put this place square into the bad review category. If the food had been as good as I was expecting, I would have probably overlooked the undisclosed 3% issue. But all together, yikes. This is a place to avoid.  Incidentally, I tried the newer location at Tivoli Village (if it's even still there) shortly after it opened. I wasn't crazy about the food there, either - though the service was great. I thought that perhaps the original location would be better. I couldn't have been more wrong.  Leticia's is a cute place where people seem to have a lot of fun. There's tons of potential. I hope it gets good management and a customer forward approach someday. Add some decent food on top of that, and you'd have a huge winner.",

But will not be coming back until a major issue of theft is stopped.  3% charge for using debit/credit card, which I used a visa, and visa's merchant service agreement clearly states that a business is not allowed to charge any fee for transactions over 10$!!!  And there was no way of knowing about the charge until we received our 90$ RECEIPT AFTER I HAD PAID!!  Nickel and dime'n people is not good business.  I own/operate a small business, and I don't charge any fees for any amount, period.   Would never even think about it for a pos transaction.  The only thing Leticia's is gaining from this is anger from a loyal clientele, who in turn, should start reducing the amount they tip the servers by equal or greater amount of the fee they are being charged.    Subsequently, have filed a complaint with Visa, BBB is next.",

I can only imagine my disappointment and confusion had I read the reviews before eating at this restaurant.  We went on a Sunday around 2:00.  The hostess was unfriendly and unwelcoming, but nonetheless we were seated quickly.  The restaurant look and feel is very average.  No unique decor, no ambiance, just your basic looking food house.  Very misleading from the outside appearance, in my opinion.  As I perused the menu, I was particularly struck by all of the specific rules, guidelines, directives, footnotes, etc.  Split plate charges (even on kids meals!), drink substitution upcharges, different type of rice charges, etc.  I actually read the whole menu cover to cover because it was so silly.  I actually found myself wondering if the chips and salsa would be charged to us, or not refilled for free.  Hey, I understand businesses have to make money, but the food is already way overpriced and expensive, the special rules just make it absurd.  Anyway, so the super tiny basket of tortilla chips and 3 varieties of salsa/dip were brought to our table by an apathetic busgirl.  The waiter soon followed and placing our orders was an easy, quick process.  We ate the chips in about 4 minutes, so we flagged down the busgirl to get a refill.  I was surprised to learn that the chips and salsa were, in fact, complimentary (haha), but we ended up receiving our first refill after our food was already delivered to the table (so about 20 minutes from the time we asked).  Which, hey, great, we didn't fill up on chips and salsa, right?  So, I had an order of ceviche and a carnitas street taco.  The ceviche was fine.  Not good, not bad.  Just basic.  The street taco was absolutely disgusting.  At first, I was impressed with the amount of meat, but when I realized it was very little meat and mostly globs of fat, I quickly lost my appetite.  That was made worse when I smelled my husband's ground beef tacos, which, I swear, smelled like cat food.  My husband, who eats everything, ate about a half of his taco.  In the end, we chalked this up to a \"learning experience,\" and paid our bill and left.  We are not the type to complain to try and get something for free.  I sent in feedback online, because I think it's important for the owners to know the details, but I haven't heard back.  I can't say I'm surprised, and I will never step foot in this restaurant again.",

We waiting for about 15-20 minutes before getting seated only to find plenty of sitting was there the whole time. Why leave your guest waiting when they don't have to? NEGATIVE  2 - The CHIPS were delicious! Not overly done, just perfect as it crumbled very nice.  POSITIVE  3 - Our server compeltely forgot our GUACAMOLE.  NEGATIVE  4 - The no spice sauce was SALTY. Even for me that loves salt! NEGATIVE  5 - Horchata is one of the best Horchata's I've ever had. Delicious.  POSITIVE POSITIVE  6 - The wait time for food was ridiculous. About 30 minutes for, Chimichanga Style Burrito (nothing fancy) & a plate of Cheese Enchilada & a taco (Carne Asade was dry).  NEGATIVE NEGATIVE  7 - The staff was OK - nothing out of ordinary  8 - Decor was nice.  -2  Overall, we were thoroughly disappointed after our $30 bill. Wouldn't drive out of the way for this FAVORITE Mexican of most :(",

Good for a date not with kids.   Service was slow, we ordered guacamole and had to wait for another basket of chips.  Water refills where hard to come by as well.  Food was okay but for what I paid I was expecting more.   My wife ordered enchiladas and said the cheese was cold when it came to the table.  I ordered Sopes and the meat was cold on them and cheese wasn't melted or warm.  Not the best experience and I was expecting something equal to or better than Frank and Finos but they struck out with us.",

Chef Leticia has my utmost respect, the first time I had the opportunity to meet her, she was cleaning off a table, and expediting food for the kitchen. She took my order, allowed my changes, and cooked my food to my specifics, and then delivered it to my table, to make sure it was correct. How many Executive Chef's do you know, that would put that much effort into a plate, especially during a dinner rush? Leticia's has surpassed my expectations, and actually inspired me to cook better for my own family. The food is brilliant, the atmosphere is great, and the price is right!",

The service there is always great I'd like to go in and order my soon to go you take it home and enjoy at home. They have a great special for margherita's during the week came during their happy hour in the margherita's are amazing if you ever want to get a good Margarita as just you go there and get one city at the bar and enjoy. I have yet to find anything that I do not enjoy eating when I go here there menu is very large and very good and very authentic I would give this as 1 of my top places to sit down-and eat some Mexican food. It May be a little expensive but if you have the money to splurge I suggest you go here.",

    "text": "It's my aunt Gloria's kitchen right at the edge of a legendary city! Sure, it's quite a trek for people visiting but if rented a car you should DEFINITELY make the trip over the Leticia's.  First of all, the ambiance reminds me of my mothers homeland- MEXICO. The decor consists of pottery and brightly colored paintings along with cheerful tunes. I sense a familiar sound; it's mariachi music- a sound I can only tolerate with a full cultural experience (not one I experience on the radio or anywhere else lol) At last- I am surrounded by a blanket of my mothers culture. Now I am ready for some authentic Mexican food!!! AYYYY YA YAYYY! (I am allowed to do this- It's in my blood)   I love practicing my first language here- makes me feel cool. I ALWAYS order a delicious margarita- done just as my uncle Jesse would make them.  FOOD- ODM (means OMG in spanish- Oh, Dios Mio!) I will only let you experience this yourself...but I have a few key points here that could probably illustrate how much this place seduces me to take another step deeper into the nostalgia it inspires when I pass through the doors...  1. I am gluten INTOLERANT- This does not stop me from having ALL of the wheat based foods. NOW, don't be disheartened ,oh fellow GF kin- there ARE options and they are drooliscious!! 2. Honestly, I think that number 1 fully encompasses my thoughts on the contents of this place.... 3. I asked for EXTRA salsa TO GO!!! You know, the salsa that comes with the chips and salsa at most Mexican restaurants?? YEAH....I went HAM on that salsa. 4. They didn't charge me for it like other places would...super thumbs up.  5. It's family owned to the point where the owner HERself comes out to greet the customers and even cooks some of the food alongside her chefs- GIRL POWER!!",

This is our new fave Mexican place in LV. We still heart Casa Don Juan, but it's way on the other side of town.  The decor is nice, but maybe just a tad dark on the bar side. They brought out chips, salsa and bean dip, all of which were delicious. Best chips and salsa BY FAR that we have had in LV. The food was really really good. My wife had crispy tacos -- she loved the carne asada but didnt care for the chicken. The 13 year old had the ground beef taco and liked it. I had the Quesa Shrimp Tacos, the house specialty, and they were very good (the corn tortillas were ok, not great). The shrimp was SCRUMPTIOUS! Overall, the food was very good. Warning: the portion sizes are HUGE.  I can see what other people are saying about the service. Our server was somewhat indifferent. It took quite a while to get our food. But it didnt ruin our meal, and I wouldnt let it stop you from trying the place.  It was a bit pricey -- $50 for 2 sodas, a 2 taco plate, a 1 taco plate, and the special tacos.",

We have always had consistently amazing service, accompanied by the most authentic Mexican food we have found here in Las Vegas. The menu selection offers a wide variety of mouth watering options. Food arrived at our table steaming hot, mouth watering and very generous portions. We both highly recommend this treasure and will continue to celebrate special occasions here. Absolutely love the environment, service and delicious food!",

After not dining here for 3-4 months, a group of friends and I decided to meet for lunch today and try it again. The chips, salsas, and beans were great as usual. I shared the empanadas (1 chicken tinga, 1 beef), Mexican corn, and had a bite of carne asada chimichanga. It was all good, but for the prices ($15 for the chimichanga burrito!) I feel it's not a great value.  The main area of concern was the service. After being seated it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order (water and iced tea), and an additional 20 minutes for the drinks to be delivered. Granted it was a Saturday afternoon, but it's standard to have at least waters brought out within 15 minutes of a party being seated. When we politely asked our server about the drinks, she made some excuse about the bartender being busy. Not cool Leticia's, not cool.",

I got the carne asada fajitas thinking that this is a good rated restaurant with good food and high prices so the meat should b of quality!  Well, the carne asada was the kind of steak you have to chew on forever before deciding it's not not breaking down so you either have to spit it out or swallow it whole.  The to go condiments for fajitas was tiny and didn't fill much of the container they put it in and didn't come with sour cream either.  My husband ordered Leticias award winning quesadilla tacos and these were really good.  They were filled with shrimp.  The poblano white rice casserole was very bland though.  We got a small bag of tortillas, really should have taken a picture.  It probably was about 15 chips.  Would not order take away from there again,  prices were high and didn't get what expected out of a quality restaurant for the prices.",

Hubby did like the Consume soup.  The staff was friendly, but service was slow and they never checked on us to refill drinks.  I do like the decor, but the fluorescent lighting is bad.  The place is always packed so we thought why not give it a try again & it's so close to home.  However we won't be returning.  Sorry Leticias, Michoacan is just much much better.",

    "text": "As I understand it, Leticia's recipes come from her mother's kitchen in Mexico City.  That definitely explains some of the great tastes found here.  Chips and Salsa start the meal, like almost every Mexican Restaurant here in Las Vegas.  That is not the case in the places I have been in Mexico... but I'm a fan anyways.  And Letecia gives you three dip choices...  A traditional salsa, salsa verde, and bean dip.  All are excellent, though my favorite is the bean dip.   The entree's are excellent.  They boast a variety of creative tacos that will really get your tasebuds firing.  But I was all about the mole poblano on this trip.  Now I have had some great mole's in Mexico and every one is different from the next.  Here in the states, most places get too caught up on the \"chocolate\" part.  In reality several Mole's don't even include chocolate and those that rank among the best in Mexico don't emphasize the chocolate.  The sauce has dozens of ingredients.  I was really excited to try Leticia's.  Unfortunately, it came across too chocolate for me.  This will probably appeal to a lot of people... but not me.  Everything else was great and all my party enjoyed their food.  It was all excellent.... but I just didn't care for the mole.  Topping off your meal with fresh Churo's is a nice nod to Mexican street food and truly delicious.  The service was excellent and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  I like Leticia's a lot!  I will be back often for the tacos and enchiladas... but not for the mole poblano.  I am glad to have a great Mexican restaurant in an area that is starving for restaurants.  I hope Leticia's sticks around.    Give it a try!",

    "text": "Absolutely awful!!! I am latino myself, so let me start by letting you know the extent of knowledge of GOOD, homemade latin foods (I am Spanish, with Mexican, Columbian, and Guatemalan relatives). My wife, 2 kids, and myself visited the restaurant after just moving to this side of town, in search of a place comparable to Viva Zapata's (North east Vegas), and we found Leticia's and gave them a try. The bean dip was plain, but the salsas were good, although for a family of 4, they really should increase the amount chips they give. We started with the grilled corn, which was good, but you really can't mess up an easy classic like that. My kids ordered the bean and cheese burrito (my son added the asada steak to his), my wife orded the Chile Relleno with an enchilada, and I ordered the Cecina A La Tampiquea. My son was disappointed to find out that they did not ADD the asada to his burrito, but instead, made it a burrito with ONLY ASADA. My son is a big fan of refried beans, so that literally ruined his appetite, seeing as he had to eat chips until they fixed his order (15 min. later). My wive's look on her face after taking a bite out of her chile relleno tipped me off. It was GROSS! Under cooked batter with ABSOLUTELY no seasoning! MY wife had to scrape the batter off to eat it, and worst of all, when I asked management about it, they said they got too many complaints about it being to \"egg-e,\" so they had to change it; awful. The worst part of all, was the sauce! The sauce they add to the Chile Relleno was, without a doubt, plain tomato sauce from a can. There is NO mistaking it, that was NOT a salsa Colorado. My steak with mushrooms, bacon, and cheese was good; under-seasoned, but good. My issue with my plate was, WHAT MEXICAN STEAK IS COVERED IN MUSHROOMS, BACON, AND ONIONS??????? Great if this was a steak house, but that's not what this place is. The enchilada that is paired with it was bad. The tortilla they used for the enchilada was far too thick, over-cooked, and taste-less. What really ruined it all, in the end, was the customer service. After complaining to management about all those issues, all they told me was about all the praise they get from their clientele, and looked at me like I was nuts. Seeing as I was the ONLY latino there, was that a hate crime? Anyhow,  In conclusion: bland, un-traditional, non-clever, and SEVERLY overpriced \"Mexican\" food. Save money, and go down the street to Roberto's or Chipotle. They may not be the best, but on this side of town, they're much better.",

When it comes to the food however I can offer no complaints as the portions are very solid and the food, delicious. L  It's worth a visit, just pray to the restaurant gods you end up going on a good day for that great overall experience that they can deliver.",

I know because I have been searching for over 4 years with no luck, until today. I got a tip about Leticia's Mexican Cocina just yesterday. It is a very long way away from my house, but I felt good enough about the tip to drive all the way across town today to check it out for lunch. I ordered make your own combo which I chose the noodle soup, chicken enchilada with red sauce, beef tostada and added in an extra of Carne Asada. Lunch started two very good salsa's and warm bean dip, and was quickly followed up with a very tasty tomato noodle soup! The main course was nothing short of excellent. My fav was probably the carne Asada, but the other two were excellent as well. The beans and rice were a very nice compliment! The great news is that it is far and away the best Mexican food in Vegas in my opinion!!! My waiter, Walter was also great... Taking care of all my needs! The bad news is that it is 40 minutes away from my house, but I will be scooping up all my friends and diving back over to enjoy often!!! There was a group of 6 first timers across from me and all agreed that it wad thumbs up from everyone. One gal said I am glad I live in Cali or I would be huge if I lived close!!!",

Second, it was a long wait for drinks and then another long wait to place our order. After all of that, the longest wait was to get a to go box and our check. There was never an acknowledgement from any staff about the wait time. We were really disappointed considering the food was so good. Hoping for better next time.",

For my main course I had the birria sopes lunch special, which they were just delightful! They had the right spice, correct and authentic birria taste that paired well with a negra modelo. My only complaint if any at all was the service, regardless the waitress being kind it took her a long time delivering our drinks, then I asked for some orange juice, me thinking they had fresh squeezed OJ like in other authentic Mexican food restaurants but they brought OJ that was straight from the cartoon, to which is my fault I believe, I should had asked if they had fresh squeezed OJ. The OJ taste is what led me to order the Negra Modelo and I'm glad I did because it paired really well with my meal! The prices and the food was definitely worth the wait!!!",

Pretty standard stuff with the exception that the habanero salsa was awesome. It was thick, flavorful and packed with the beautiful kick one would expect from habanero. I ordered the rellano with chicken tiana. Although it's not something Jose Andres or Aaron Sanchez would boast about but it's a very sturdy dish. Add some of the habanero and chipotle salsa mixed together on top of the dish and it taste very good. Choose corn tortilla over flour because the corn tortillas are handmade in house.  The Diet Pepsi tasted authentic too   I'll be returning soon for the fajitas....",

She checked in on us frequently and was friendly.   The chips, salsas, and bean dip to start were delicious. I could not keep out of the chips. The bean dip had a great flavor and texture. Both salsas had a nice flavor. My virgin margarita was good. A margarita obviously is best with tequila, but the bartender made it perfectly for my request.   Since I couldn't stop with the chips I went with the Enchilada lunch special for a smaller portion. I'm so glad I did because it was plenty of food. The shredded beef I chose for the enchilada was tender and I loved the flavor of the tomatillo sauce on top. It had a slight sweetness to it. The sides of rice and beans were tasty too. My friend ordered the Carnitas which came with tortillas making it like fajitas. He loved it and also thought the lunch special was plenty of food.   The lunch specials were very affordable. Two lunches and a virgin margarita came to about $25 with tip! You can't beat that. The food was delicious so I'll definitely return even when lunch specials aren't available.",

I believe that the drink presentation and taste could have been better, but it was a huge deal breaker. I mean I could get just a beer next time.

My gorgeous girlfriend had the Sopa de Mariscos with a lobster tail!  Yes I tried it and Yes it was amazing!  In my opinion, it's very similar to Cioppino, which is one of my favorite dishes ever!  I'm betting the drinks are great too, although I didn't have any.  And of course, your server will get you started with warm tortillas, salsa and bean dip.    The restaurant is located inside of the Fiesta Hotel and Casino.",

    "text": "We stopped in the cute little area for lunch after volunteering at a foundation near by. The area is super duper cute and makes you feel like you're in another city (Portland or San Diego). We popped in and asked to sit on the patio. The wait time was a little longer than what we expected considering there were plenty of open tables.   The service was really great. Our waters were never empty and their tequila selection was pretty good. Chips come complementary to the table with three different salsa options. I could only eat two, one had meat in it. I ordered the salad bowl... picked my lettuce, vegetables, protein (black beans), rice (jasmine cilantro), and guacamole. Small or large option... I recommend the large, So you can have some for later ;) it was delicious. Nothing I couldn't make at home... but for a healthy choice in a Mexican restaurant, it was the way to go. My boyfriend ordered the burrito... it was huge. He enjoyed it and had some for later as well. The prices were fair, and we will be back again when we are in the area. Definitely give it a try!",

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with traditional Mexican art, pottery and furnishings and it really gives the sense that you're about to dine some really good Mexican food. My motto: if the restauranteur doesn't care about their establishment they obviously cant care about the food.  We were seated promptly and had 2 different servers come up to us asking us if we were ready for drinks or to be served. That's a big thumbs up for prompt and attentive service.  The chips, beans and salsa they serve you before your meal are amazing and we almost filled up on them. lol. The menu is vast and filled with many goodies and everytime I come here i am never disappointed in my selection.   The prices are reasonable. So don't expect to break your wallet. But remember to tip well. The staff here is great!",

    "text": "We had a fantastic dinner at Leticia's! I dined here at the recommendation of a friend who couldn't stop ranting and raving about how great the food is. When we arrived, it seemed others agreed with him as there were a lot of parties waiting to be seated on a Saturday night.   After about a 20 minute wait, we were seated and promptly greeted by our friendly server. He got our drinks to us quickly and loaded us up with fresh chips, salsa, and a tasty bean dip (all free of charge!). The salsa was a bit too spicy for me and also a little runny, but the bean dip was just so addicting and delicious. My friends and I were all but fighting over it!  When the time came to order, I chose to go with their \"award winning\" quesa tacos with carne asada. I was so very pleased when they arrived. The tortillas were so soft and fresh, the cheese was stringy and flavorful, and the spicy sauce tucked between the two tortillas was insanely good. I don't handle heavy spice well at all and this was just perfect for me. The steak was tender and juicy. It was all great!  The included sides were the meaty beans (similar flavor profile to the bean dip) and a cheesy rice casserole. Both were yummy but the tacos were quite filling, particularly after loading up on all of those chips and bean dip!  Overall, this is a great place to stop for some delicious Mexican food, very much worth the drive. Good food, good service, and good prices! Just be prepared for a bit of a wait if you come on the weekend...but it'll be worth it!",

Both was so savory with the melted grilled cheese combined with the fresh tortillas and flavorful meats. Omg the best taco I ever ate.  The side of Pocono rice was unusual, but very addicting. Also the service was on point and so helpful with navigating the massive menu. I can't wait to get my grub on again here!",

I've been here multiple times and each time I've left so full and happy.   I always try something new when I come in and I'm pleased to say I haven't been unhappy even once! From the chicken, beef, pork etc whatever you choose is marinated in a delicious blend of spice that will have you craving more. I took my mom here for the first time and she love it as well.   First off the beans and salsa they bring to the table to start you off is so good I usually ask for a second helping. I love that they have Elote as an appetizer choose and for $4 I always get two orders. I forgot to take a photo because I devour it it so quickly. Haha!   Both my mom and I decided to try out the Chili Rellenos. She went with the recommendation of our awesome waitress and got the white sauce seafood one! I on the other hand choose the pork and beef. Both were amazing! OMG we both ate our entire dish with no left overs.   I was to full at this point to order dessert but usually if I don't pig out to much I get the fried ice cream which is also awesome!   Overall, amazing food, great ambiance, and the staff is friendly! I wish I knew the name of one of the bus guys because he is hilarious and makes me laugh every time I stop in.",

Took 1 star away because service seems to be hit and miss for us so far, and I think it depends on which side of the restaurant you are sitting at.",

    "text": "I'm not one to give out five stars unless I feel a place earns it and honestly this is the best Mexican restaurant in town, considering this is the only Leticias in town. This isn't your typical chain restaurant.  The environment inside is very nice. Decor matches the obvious theme, the lighting is at a slight dim and the bar has a sort of cantina look to it. Every time I've been the staff has always been pleasant and personable, always willing to strike up conversation besides the typical \"What can I get for you?\" routine.  The first thing they bring out are tortilla chips made in house, along with bean dip, verde salsa and a black salsa. The chips and dips are so good that you can get full from eating so many, they are that delicious. They have a crisp airy taste and taste like they just finished making them. When I say the chips are baked in-house, you can genuinely taste that they are. Amazing way to start a meal.  My first visit there I ordered the Milanesa and man was I blown away. Everything seemed to be cooked perfectly. The portions are huge so unless you come with an appetite plan on leftovers. My second visit I ordered the quesa shrimp tacos and just when I thought their food couldn't get better these tacos proved me wrong. The only way I can describe their food is to let your taste buds do all the talking for me. I decided to try out their dessert and their tres leches is delicious. I was given complimentary coffee with it which was an amazing gesture in my book. Be sure to check in as sometimes you'll get a free treat to top your meal!  Overall, this place takes the cake when it comes to Mexican dining. Prices can get a tad steep but I'm okay for paying a little more when the food is well worth it. A++ in my book.",

I always like to try the local eateries highlighted on TV.  The tacos she won with were the Quesa Tacos.  From their menu:  QuesaTacos wrapped in a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese, stuffed with our grilled shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce \"Mild, Medium or Spicy\" your choice of tortillas and topped with our chipotle cream sauce, served with our Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas, Additional filling choices of gilled Chicken, shredded Beef, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Birria, Chicken Tinga or any Sauteed Vegetables.  I had two original shrimp tacos.  My son had regular tacos: two Al pastor and two Birria (goat).  I gave him one of mine and took one of his birria.  FMR, they were delicious.  The Quesa Taco was superior, and the birria was tender and sweet.  When we sat down, we were brought chips and three bowls of dips: one fire-roasted salsa, one bean dip, and one an avocado-tomatillo sauce.  Excellent.  Even the beans and rice which accompanied my taco plate were spiced and cheesed.  I've never had rice in a Mexican restaurant as flavorful.  This place is in the extreme northwest, about 45 minutes drive from my house, but the drive was well worth the trip.  In a word: go.  In two words: go now!",

As we were standing at the front door, I looked again at the open times sign, and there was a tiny (german) cockroach actually crawling between the glass and the sign INSIDE! Needless to say, we high tailed it without going in.. If there is a cockroach that usually hides from the light in full sight on the door, I can only imagine what's inside!",

The staff, no matter how busy, goes out of their way to let you know you are noticed and appreciated.   That sense of comfort translates over to the food,  where your party will be greeted not with the typical dry chip and bland salsa affair, but a hearty trio of red and green sauces, along with a surprisingly filling bean dip. My first time here I gorged myself so heavily on the preamble that I had to take my main course to go without tasting it!  The food comes out in the traditional large portions you'd expect and this leads to an occasional problem of saltiness or slightly dry meat,  but i have never once left anything other than satisfied.

So we order our appetizer shrimp cocktail pretty decent and our meals, cocktail came out first as it was suppose to then this is where we ran into the PROBLEM. my wife and sons food came out and I was told mine was to come out in a second, so I sat their patiently until it arrived 20 min later. After my family was done eating.  So I had them box it up and took it home.  We did not receive any apologies or anything.  I will try to go back 1 more time, I understand accidents happen. 1/21/16",

    "text": "Very disappointed with the service. I rarely go out to eat Mexican food but today I was craving Menudo. We were seated right away at a booth right by the bar. The waitress asked what we wanted to drink since we didn't know she brought us water. Upon her return with the waters we told her we wanted a cafe de la olla and a cafe con leche. I was in the middle of asking her what the different bowl sizes were when she interrupted me to tell me she would be right back because she wanted to put in our coffee order because it would take about 10 min to make. She left and it took her a while to come back. She came back because I flagged her down because I wanted to give her our food order. My sister and I ordered enchiladas and a small menudo. We waited a while and she finally brought our food out. She asked how everything looked and I said it was ok but we still needed our coffee. She left to check on them and after a few minutes she came back and told us that she had forgotten to put our order in and that they would take a while more to come out. Our coffee finally came out by the time we were almost done eating the menudo tasted old by the way. We sat at our booth finished our coffee and the waitress never came back. Finally after a long wait I flagged her down and asked for our check. That took a long time to get when she finally brought it to me I handed her my credit card without looking at the check. This woman walked all over the place with my check and card and I had to wait a very long time just to pay. I finally got up and walked over to her and told her I needed to leave and that she needed to run my card and give me by receipt and card back. I have been here before and I have never seen a waitress that is this disorganized she is too busy yapping and sticking her nose in other customers conversations. She did not charge us for our coffee but I would have rather she put in the order when she said she would that way we could have had our drinks with our meals. The restaurant was not busy when we got there and our order was easy. I just don't know why this waitress can focus.",

Everything we've had here is excellent. Be careful with the spice... It can creep up on you. BUT. It's obvious from the mouthfeel of the spicy food that they use extremely fresh ingredients (habanero, green chilis, etc). Maury is our favorite bartender (we normally go in the middle of the week). If you're going in the evening, plan to get there early as there is usually a wait.",

Their chips come with  homemade salsas that are outstanding.. avocado & fire roasted  are standouts. I wanted something w some more heat & my server Natalie suggested the homemade habaneros salsa, which filled my desire. Its not on their menu and they have something else also w more heat, the habaneros did it for me.  The birria came w rice beans & tortillas, the meat was was wonderfully seasoned & tasty w no bone or fat w the tasty gravy. I want to experience the rest of their menu because it was the birria was perfect, easily the best I've had it cooked. My server Natalie was on top of every need or request  as well the others on her team.. Definitely will explore their cuisine again.",

They arrived on the usual black grill plate only they weren't steaming....lukewarm at best in a soupy juice of zucchini and tiny little bits of \"cooked chicken\" not even grilled.  It reminded me of the chicken you get in chow mein.  There was absolutely no Mexican flavor.  We were so disappointed and will not be returning.",

    "text": "- The Skinny:  Food Quality: 5 Stars -  Real Mexican food in Vegas! Tried the following with my family:  El Molcajete (Mexican style Fajitas) - Grilled Carne Asada, or Chicken (you can add chicken), Tiger Prawn Shrimp, seasoned grilled nopales (Mexican Cactus) served sizzling in a molcajete salsa Ranchera , chile & onion toreados, Queso Oaxaca. Served with mexican rice, guacamole, pico de gallo and choice of tortillas. We had the carne asada & added Chorizo.   Tasty! But not as much meat as other places. A little spicy if you are sensitive. Chorizo was pretty salty. My wife used the left overs to make eggs the next day, sooo good!!   Enchiladas Del Mar (Seafood Enchiladas) - Shrimp And/Or fish in Leticia's white Cream and Cheese sauce or Chile de Arbol spicy sauce. Served with a Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas.   This was really good and different take on a Mexican classic!   Pozole -  tender beef and pork, slowly cooked with a blend of red guajillo sauce and Leticia's special spices and hominy. Served traditionally with a side of tostaditas, lime, chopped onions, cilantro, chopped lettuce, radishes, oregano, crushed chile and avocad (Chicken Pozole also available).  I didn't try it but my brother enjoyed it.  Quesadilla - Large flour tortillas with house blend of Oaxaca melted cheese, served with guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.  There was A LOT of cheese in these, easily shared by 2 people. Well made and tasty.   The table Chips, Salsa, and beans were really good too!  Drinks: 5 Stars - The Mango \"Agua Fresca\" (Fresh Fruit Water) is AMAZING!! The Horchata was also good with a little creamy instead of watery taste most other places have.    Pricing: 5 Stars - What you would pay at most sit down Mexican spots. Good portions!   Service: 4 Stars - Nice, friendly, attentive, they do a good job! There was a bit of a wait.  Atmosphere: 5 Stars - Really liked the decor of this place, they really have a that Mexican culture feel. Even the Caucasian host was in a traditional dress!    Comfort: 5 Stars - Plenty of seating, comfortable seats and tables.   Location: 5 Stars  Plenty of parking in that area, easy seen from the road and simple to get to.   - The Fat:   Went out to eat with my brother and his family. Only my sister in law had been there and she loved the place. We weren't convinced though because not to offend, but she's a white girl and were all Mexican (our parents were born/raised in Mexico) so we have more a say so on Mexican food ;)     We really had a hard time deciding on what to get cause the whole menu looks delicious! We were pleasantly surprised by the food. My wife and I love \"Molcajete\" but it's hard to find a good one, none the less, a place that even serves it! there is a lot of \"soup\" in the molcajete bowl so my wife used the left overs to make eggs the next day, sooo good!!  I really enjoy the \"Enchiladas Del Mar\" and would get that next time. The Mango drink is to die for! If you want a different Mexican food experience far from the usual sit down Mex chains, go here!",

We had to have our basket refilled twice. :P  I got the chile verde which is a green chile sauce stew with pork and potatoes. Seriously so delicious and tasty. The pork was full of flavor and tasted really marinated. The dish came with a side of beans, rice, and flour.   My bf got the carne asada burrito and that too had really tasty meat.

It is located in the far northwest of the valley, but luckily we live within 10 minutes away.  We dined here last night and it was everything I had hoped for.  We were seated right away, and we had our drink orders and chips served almost immediately. Our food server (waitress)  was wonderful, the margarita's were delicious and the chips/salsas/bean dip were freshly made (a bean dip, a smoky mild salsa, and a guacamole/cilantro smooth dip). When the meal arrived, I knew before even taking the first bite, that it would be great. And it was.  We both ordered the shredded chicken enchilada's with Ranchera sauce (they offer other flavor sauces but we have been looking for Ranchera sauce with enchilada's for as long as we have searched for a restaurant.)  Our rice (Mexican rice) and refried beans were very tasty with a lot of good flavorings.   The quaint little street the restaurant is located is designed beautifully, and the interior decor was very nice, and colorful. We will definitely be coming back.",

From Zumba dancers, line dancing, and some cultural entertainment from Rancho High School Ballet Folklorico, and Chapparal High School's Mariachi Band. Another group was planning to play Rock en Espanol, but it was getting late, and we bailed when they were dealing with sound check issues. all in all, a good night out with the wife.

We didn't know what to get but our server Rigelio was very very helpful. We got the enchiladas and that you build your own burrito. The cream sauce and the Tinga chicken burrito was delish! I also got the burrito half mole and half cheese cream sauce, enchilada style which was good so I could try two sauces. I live in central Las Vegas but believe me I will be back with more people to try this place :)",

I always share this dish with my husband and we ALWAYS ask for extra cheese. This last visit it was missing the cactus and Xtra cheese. I informed our waitress and she was very apologetic so that made it better, all was forgiven. Then a lady came over and  stuck a plate of cheese in my face. This RUDE lady was the manager, she felt like she needed to give me a lesson about the types of cheese and informed me I asked for the wrong cheese. We never even got extra cheese so not sure what she was talking about. By this time I was finished eating, she ruined my night. I asked for extra cheese inside the dish so it was hot and melted when it was served, which the waitress understood but I guess it was miscomunicated to the kithen. I've never been so insulted. We won't be back.",

Quality is just ok.   I have a friend who is obsessed with the place, so I will go back if \"he's buying\".  I did take my neice and nephew, from Korea, who never ate Mexican Food. Gus was nice enough to spice up their food, and they did like the Carne Asada Soft Tacos.  So, if 'it's someone who's never eaten Mexican Food, sure.

    "text": "I would give 0 stars if possible. What a ripoff. My sister and friends are regulars here and always talk about how amazing it is, so I was really looking forward to eating what I thought would be good Mexican food. We decided to order takeout on Sunday and were shocked at the poor quality of the food as well as ridiculous prices, which did not match the listed prices online. An order of 3 queso carne asada tacos, guacamole, french fries (for my nephew), and one lemonade ended up costing $68.  That would have been fine if the food was gourmet-level, authentic Mexican food but it tasted like Roberto's. If I wanted to eat subpar, greasy food I would have just gone there and paid their prices. One of our orders was supposed to sub a side salad for beans but the order included the beans with no salad in sight. The boxes had no markings to distinguish the spicy tacos from the mild. A few bites in, my cousin bit into a hair baked into her food so everybody was grossed out and that dish had to be thrown out.   We also notified one of the staff that the prices aren't accurate on their online menu and he said that they already had 3 complaints about that earlier that day. Seems like they should either honor those prices or change their online menu so diners aren't in for a nasty surprise. The food was cold when we picked it up and they were very stingy with the condiments. When we asked for salsa, we were given a miniature to-go sauce container and told that if we wanted more it would be an additional $5. Don't order take-out from here unless you want to be nickel and dimed for every little thing.  The restaurant itself looks cute and has a nice atmosphere but the experience of ordering take-out was so frustrating and unpleasant that I will not be returning to dine in. I don't know if they had an off night or whether this is a common occurrence but that entire experience was completely unacceptable.",

There's often a wait (for good reason) but it's worth it.  Don't look for ground beef and yellow cheese here. The authentic recipes come with queso and shredded beef.  They make a rice with green chile's and cheese that's to die for!  Yummy!  Given a choice by the family I always choose Letecias.

It took me a while to get used to the rice that comes with the taco plate because it isn't your usual Spanish rice. It has cheese in it and some type of pepper in it. The first time I got it I really needed to look because it was so dark in the restaurant . It is different but it is tasty!  The guacamole is also a nice size for the price you pay.   The service is attentive and quick. They will fill up our chips or drinks before we have to ask. It's a great spot to sit and relax while getting a bite to eat.",

I feel like the food is almost losing its authenticity. My family and I don't even finish our food there anymore, we just take the rest to go and don't even touch it anymore. The wait time has gotten ridiculous too. They just stuff you with chips and dip until your food comes hoping you don't notice how long you've been waiting.",

    "text": "Leticia's.....My go to \"sit down\" Mexican restaurant in the NW.  A True dining gem and one..knowing what I know now..would drive from any of the three other points of the valley to visit.  Parking has never been an issue.  That being said depending on when you arrive,  the wait could be an issue.  My advise is be prepared as the inside and outside waiting area's are small.  You could opt for a seat in the bar to wait or dine.  But is you have to wait..where ever that might be..hang in there because it it all worth it.  The inside of LMC is full of character and when you are eventually seated, creates a vibe where you can focus on your family and drown everything else out.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip are divine.  Many a visit I have sabotaged myself.  DON'T DO IT!  It might take you a few visits to learn this and STILL on my most recent visit I failed to heed my own advise.  BALANCE!  Don't spoil the meal with a belly full of this mana.  My personal favorites (so far) are as follows...  The Queso Fundiso, it's fun to say and fun to eat.  Make sure you add the fungus (mushrooms).  It's makes this gooey and cheesy combination with the delicious tortillas POP!  Next up is Leticia's award winning \"Quesa Tacos.\"  This consists of a blend of melted cheeses cooked in a delicious sauce.  You can choose shrimp, chicken or beef, carne asada, or many other meats.  The beef and the shrimp have been my favorites.  You can control the heat of the meal to your liking.  The Pobalano rice is phenomenal!  On my last LMC adventure, I thought I would try something REALLY different.  \"El Molcajete\" is the prehistoric version of the popular flaming fajitas. Primal but even more delicious, it comes in a smoldering bowl which looks like it was made out of volcanic stone.  A slab of tender carne asada, cheese, ranchero sauce, with shrimp. There was also some greenery hanging off the side which I thought was poblano pepper.  WRONG! After looking at the website, it was a delicious piece of Mexican Cactus.  The Margarita's...............................You will just have to experience them yourself.  The service though one time or two seemed overtaxed.  But the other staff tries hard to fill in making the experience seamless.  When everything IS in sync, no one cane beat it's tasty and friendly efficiency.",

    "text": "\"What do you feel like eating?\" is probably the most difficult decision my bf and I ask each other all the time. Sometimes it takes us forever to come up with a decision, other times it doesn't. But thanks to Yelp, we found this place and both agreed on it right away.   Right away, our drinks arrived along with our chips and dip. Dip was beans, tomatillo sauce and a chipotle roasted salsa. All delish and packed with flavor. I don't usually like beans, but these were pretty good. The bf also put in an order of guacamole with crab. Their guacamole was also really good. It was thick and chunky with big pieces of crab on top.   Now for our main dishes. Since I was getting full from chips and dip, I opted for a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a side salad. My cup of soup was a huge serving for it being in a cup. It was ok, nothing special. It was a little on the salty side so I wasn't able to eat it all. I also got a side salad, which was AWFUL!! When it arrived at the table, there was so much cheese on it. Then I noticed the reason why it was covered in so much cheese was because the lettuce was old and wilted. I asked our server to just take it off the bill and she was shocked that my salad looked the way it did. She was nice about it and took it off. The bf's carne asada burrito was the highlight of the meal. The meat was so tender. Although the burrito was on the smaller side, it was packed with so much meat, cheese and beans that we both got full from it.   Definitely a good spot for Tex-Mex food! Since I live so far away, I doubt I'll be eating here any time again soon. If I'm in the area, this will definitely be a one of my options though.",

    "text": "I was stoked to try this place tonight after reading a lot of the good reviews and mainly pictures of food that looked really good.  Unfortunately the experience went bad pretty quickly for us.  We showed up around 4pm on a Saturday night, nobody was waiting and half the restaurant was empty tables.  We were told it was a 10-15 minute wait.  Marginally confused by that we assumed it was because of a lack of servers or because we were 2 adults with a baby and stroller and just maybe they were waiting for the right table for us. After 15 minutes we were sat at the first table in the place that didn't look like it was normally used, it was missing stuff that other tables had and one side was 3 inches taller than the other.   This started our discomfort, it also was very hot being right near the door.  Overall we didn't think this was the end of the world and were excited to try some hopefully great food. We started with a pitcher of margaritas and chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa were very good, we thought we had found a great place.  It came with 2 salsas and beans with excellent flavor and the chips were homemade.  The margarita was so so, a little sugary and didn't taste alcohol but definitely not a deal breaker. Everything went wrong with the food and how they handled it.  I ordered the Hamburgesa Poblana and my wife ordered the Leticia's Award Winning Quesa Tacos.  The tacos were OK, definitely not what a lot of these pictures showed.  Our server forgot about us a lot and they seemed like they had sat under a light for 10 minutes before coming to the table.  Not near as good as we hoped but edible.  The Hamburgesa Poblana was one of the worst things I've ever had.  At first I noticed the bread was dry and it was forgetting the sauce it said it came with.  I waited ten minutes for the server to get some sour cream hoping to make it better.  After finally getting that and adding it I realized it was missing the bacon, avocado and toreados.  I figured oh well at this point eat it and move on.  A few bites in I had to stop.  The meat was pink and barely cooked, everything was soggy, the bread seemed days old and somehow this burger tasted fishy.  I couldn't do it.  I waited another while to tell the server I was sorry I couldn't eat this, it was missing things and not done right and we'd appreciate our check,  She was nice enough about it, did try to push us on dessert (I have only ate chips and margarita at this point and just wanted to leave) but then came back with the check.  On the check was a charge for the sour cream which was supposed to be on the burger in the first place.  I ended up grabbing a manager and she tried to help but I still left spending $45 for some sugary margaritas, a stale meal for my wife and a burger that isn't making me feel well.  Overall I appreciate the manager at the end trying to help (She did offer to comp the burger next time to try it again but I can't bare the thought of a next time honestly) but I can't recommend this place or come back.  Maybe we just had a bad experience but it isn't a good feeling leaving a place paying $45 for what we got.  I guess we stick with Lindo Michoacan, never had bad luck there!",

Now the avocado and strips are in a side container so that when I heated up that wonderfully delicious soup I could add them at the end and all is well in the world.

    "text": "My fiance is grotesquely addicted to Mexican cuisine. Wether it is authentic or TexMex, he craves it. If he could have a burrito everyday, he'd do so. I, on the other hand, find Mexican food on the same level as a Wendy's hamburger. Which is why I was delightfully surprised when we stumbled in here and found some great food, along with the warmest and most inviting decor I've encountered in North Las Vegas. Walking in was truly an eye-pleaser. We were immediately directed to a comfy booth, and then confronted with the traditional basket of complimentary chips and salsa. Two salsas, and a bean dip, all of which were tasty.   The fiance ordered the tamale plate, which was delicious, and I had the bouillabaisse, which was divine. The tamales were smothered to perfection. The meat inside could melt in your mouth. The sides complimented the overall flavor, and the plate was fairly large, though not enough that the price was justifiable. The bouillabaisse was delicious. The broth was warm, not overly tomatoe-y (if that's even a word) and the amount and quality were about right for the price point. ($25.00.)  Laura and Oscar waited and bussed on us Sunday evening around 7:00pm. Both were incredibly nice, considerate, and honest. The service here would have been perfect had our food not taken over half and hour to get to us. Laura had to check on the kitchen a couple times before anything came to our table. I was feeling very sick that day, so my irritability came as swift as the drink refills did. I cannot at all blame either server, though. They took care of us and did everything in their power to make us happy. Great personalities.  After forty minutes the food arrived. I then ordered the flan with chocolate cake, however they were out of the cake portion. So I settled for the flan alone, instead. I like most flan in general, I'm not picky. I think it's all pretty smooth and wonderful. So when I took a bite of this dense little mound of rubber and water, I was so horribly disappointed. I thought maybe it might be due to me being sick (messing with my tastes and textures), but nonetheless it was just...not great. Presentation was bland. Flavors were off. Texture was just awful. The little gross place on the college campus provides better flan in their little plastic boxes (I'm 100% not over exaggerating).   Overall, I was a tad bit agitated. More like disappointed. The food was so good, excluding dessert. And the service was great on the waiting staff, horrid on the kitchen. If you don't mind a wait, and want a hearty, romantic, authentic meal, then Leticia's is definitely the place for you.  UPDATE: The business owner was kind enough to explain their situation in the kitchen that day, and reached out to me asking to drop in again. That was insanely considerate and very sweet. I bumped my review up a star and definitely intend to stop back in for a bite. Nothing is more awesome than someone who is passionate about their business and food.",

The chile rellenos (I had the cheese and also the beef stuffed rellenos) are not even worth rating as average.  They were severely undercooked, and normally you don't need to take in a knife to cut rellenos.  I was literally cutting through what seemed like raw chile.  The rellenos we have at our employee dining room tastes better than theirs.  And Leticia's is not cheap.    Their award-winning tacos were delicious however, and that's what warranted them that extra star.  Their fried ice cream was also very good.  Their tres leches cake was not as moist as it should be -- weird.  That's what tres leches cake is about.  Moist and milky.  It tasted like boxed cake with milk and slivered almonds poured over it.  Other than that, the middle was somewhat dry.    Will probably never go again.",

    "text": "I was there with a group and everyone said their food was excellent.  One in our party has been to Leticia's a lot, so she obviously has had a track record of good experiences - enough to bring a group of 8 there.  I will vouch for the deliciousness of the Pozole Blanco.  I loved all the fresh veggies that you can add in proportions to your own liking.  I also learned (from having leftovers - the portion sizes were generous...  I had leftover soup from ordering a small) that the avocado in the soup (this soup, at least) was still bright green the second day when I reheated it for lunch as it was the first day.  Cool!  I live down in the Anthem area and can't think of any Mexican restaurant that quite met up to what I saw or experienced this day.  Although I do love Las Cazuelas - gave them 5 stars, too - but their menu is pretty tiny compared with Leticia's although it has the mom and pop atmosphere.  That's really the only possible complaint about Leticia's - its success means they're no longer a mom and pop place - not bad, just not as personal as it undoubtedly was when it first started.  Anyway, I will be looking for a reason to be in Centennial so I can go back sometime.",

I had the shrimp tacos quesa and they were a very generous portion - I could have easily only eaten half, and they were good but so rich with cheese and sauce. The best part of the dish was the white cheesy rice casserole - it was sinfully divine!!! Their food is overall pretty decent but it's a little pricey for mexican that is just ok.  Margarita was good however.  The owner is typically around and that was very nice to meet him and to see how much he cares about his customers.  He did everything he could to ensure we were happy.  I will go back but perhaps try a different dish.  The atmosphere is cute and exactly what you would expect for a nicer mexican restaurant.  Entrees were $16-25 a piece though and I thought that was a little pricey for the area and for the food.",

Over the years the prices have slowly gone up and I get that. I don't expect a restaurant to keep the same prices forever. I am a vegan and my husband is a vegetarian and we have limited menu choices at any restaurant. I have always loved their vegetable fajitas. On our last visit the price of veggie fajitas was $19. $19 for a hot plate of sizzling veggies, rice and beans??? I realize you get the fajita fixings and guacamole on the side but $19 is just too high for something I can make at home for a few bucks. Yes, I can make fajitas just as good at home with a flavor that's not just primarily salt. So, goodbye Leticia's...even though it is about 2 blocks from our house.",

We recently decided to try Leticia's because it looked so appealing from the outside.    We were NOT disappointed when we walked in. It is very cute and gives an instant feel of being in a local, family-owned, neighborhood restaurant. We were greeted warmly and were immediately glad we had come in.  We have now been there 3 times in 2 weeks.  We have sat at the bar each time.  The food is fresh and delicious and the carne asada has the most amazing flavors.  It was instantly our favorite!  The staff, including owner Leticia was extremely welcoming.  The bartenders are great!  Ignacia is friendly, very attentive and seems like an old friend when she chats with us.  Wendy is the epitome of friendly and always has a smile while she is giving us her full attention.  Saul is a mixologist.  He has won awards for a few of his drinks and when you taste the strawberry jalepeno margarita you will see why.  He is friendly, professional and knowledgable of the wide variety of tequila's.   We are going to take friends there next week and cannot wait to show off our new favorite place.  The only downside I can see is that it has become an addictive pleasure for us.  We look forward to going frequently!",

    "text": "Over the last year or so my taste in Mexican food has grown more sophisticated.  Circa 2009 if it had cheese and Mexican spices I was generally happy, but recently I've found old favourites like Guadalajara at Sunset Station and Cafe Coyote aren't hitting the spot like they used to.  My wife and I went to Leticia's for lunch today with a groupon and I've gotta say that I've found my new favourite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Even though it's a huge hike north to go here, the food was so good I am sure we will be back often.  The chips looked worrisome, but looks are deceiving, they are fresh as can be and absolutely delicious. They come out with some very good bean dip, and a pair of excellent salsas (one red, one green) - No \"spicy pasta sauce on a bowl\" here - these salsas taste how salsa should taste.  We started our meals with the Mexican corn which was very tasty without being overwhelming and I followed this with a plate of Nachos. I was really pleased with the use of good quality Mexican cheese and the options available so I could tailor my nachos to my specifications. I went with carne asada (incredible quality for a nacho topping) and chiles toreados.   Now, I'm something of a nacho connoisseur - if I see them on the menu then chances are they are what I am ordering - these were some really special nachos. It wasn't just the quality of the cheese. It wasn't the delicious carne asada and the fresh and tasty chips. It wasn't even the wonderfully roasted and flavourful whole green onions that laced the top of my food. It was a combination of everything. The best nachos I have eaten in Vegas by some distance.  My wife ordered vegetable enchiladas with mushrooms and spinach which came with a white rice casserole with crema, cheese and peppers. A real change from the \"Cheese in a tortilla with sauce\" that's often her only vegetarian option at Mexican places and we both really liked how Leticia's offers more to have with your meal than just rice and beans. Thought has really gone into this menu.  Overall, a great meal in pleasant surroundings. An absolute no brainer to award this one 5 stars.",

The numerous amount of staff kept our drinks on full. Even often times refilling or brining new drinks when our drinks were still 75% full. In the end we felt that it was a cover up to how slow their food serving was. It took forever for our food to get to the table. We have been told that the timing is solely about taste and delivery but when we received our plates we wondered why they still lacked taste. My two cheese enchilada in red sauce plate was disappointing in all areas. The cheese was cluttered and not melted and the red sauce was overbearing. My husbands fajita plate was alright to his taste yet he said it was a little bland. All he received was a tablespoon of guacamole and when he asked if he could get a little more we joked about how he better not be charged for the additional tablespoon sized guacamole they brought to the table yet we were charged $2.50 which was ridiculous. Only saving grace to my disappointment was the two child plates. We ordered a child chicken enchilada meal and a child beef taco meal. Granted my kids both skipped on the rice and beans, they both ate their main dish which was a plus for me seeing as how my WHOLE plate went untouched and I was still charged and had to pay for mine. Definitely not worth it and won't be back. Which is really disappointing because upon being seated, another couple was raving about how they've been driving from Boulder City to come to this place for awhile....",

    "text": "Maybe I came on an off day? Maybe my expectations are a little too high as of late? But seriously, how does this place have this volume of ratings and maintain this high of an average?! I'm not sure if I'm more pissed at the restaurant for being sub-par or this many yelpers being fooled by such simple bullshit. It's my fault for being on my dying cell phone and not taking the time to read the reviews. Otherwise I would have dismissed this place IMMEDIATELY when I realized  \"multiple salsas\" was the CONSISTENT 5 star standard for a quality establishment!  Are you frickin kidding me?  Food.  I'll try to take my shitty experience out of this equation for the moment and ask why people love this bland cookie cutter On the Boarder franchise-esq, no heart, soulless food? After finally be able to put in the order (after 20 min wait) we waited another 20 mins (I know because I timed it) to get a cold to semi-warm plate, the carnitas was over cooked, tough (that's a HUGE accomplishment if you know how to make it) and bland. Had a nice piece of bone in there too. The beans had that nice dried crust layer on top like it had been sitting under the heat lamp a little too long but was too far to get the heat.  That salsa everyone loses their shit over, was okay. El Torrito and On the Boarder has that too, so does Rubio's technically.   Service: This was just stupid. And I'm kicking myself for not walking out. Went on a late Sunday afternoon after hiking Mt. Charleston (needless to say, hungry). The place is hardly busy. One girl comes over to take drink orders, says she can't take beer orders, but the the bartender can who will also be our waitress. I don't know why she couldn't have given our order to the bartender when she informed her of our table. 10 mins later, bartender comes (Natalie) \"You want something from the bar?\" Place DRINK order. I've been watching her from my table 15 ft away flirting with some douche face at the bar. Beer comes out in a glass so cold the beer is slushy. I'm not only a pretentious dick, I'm also a beer snob. I like to taste my beer, frozen glass = no taste. In spite of my annoyance, I asked nicely If I can have a glass that isn't iced. Natalie \"They all come like that.\"  Me, \"how about that (soda) glass that isn't frozen or run one under some cold water?\" 10 mins pass, flirts with douche, comes back, replaces beer in different frozen glass. Now takes FOOD order. Food comes out like it's been under a heat lamp and the beans have that nice crust on them. We pick at our food. Flag  Natalie down for our bill, and get the hell out of this pit.  This place sucks. The food sucks, the service sucks, the menu sucks. there isn't any thing redeeming about this place. Someone please correct me if I'm out of line here.",

I have a theory that you know how the rest of the meal at a Mexican restaurant will be based off their salsa and chips. No American-style Mexican food here, we're talking about Mexican food with depth of flavor and spice. I've taken family from out-of-town here and then had them ask to return the next time they've visited because the food was so memorably delicious. Items my family, friends, and I have tried and enjoyed (in order off the menu) - quesadilla, volcanes tostaditas, queso fundido, Mexican grilled corn, carne asada, chile rellenos, camarones al mojo de ajo, spinach and mushroom enchiladas, chile colorado, Ensenada style tacos, el molcajete, and mole chicken. Long but not exhaustive list. Also worth noting, I've always had great service here and am sorry for those that haven't. I think those experiences are exceptions and not the norm. Anyway, I highly recommend this place.",

I knew when the chips and salsa came we were in for a treat.  The chip are a little thicker and  served warm with two salsas one red and the other tomatillo and beans. Heck the refried beans were tasty.           I ordered  a small guacamole , it had a little cheese stick on top as a garnish and sprinkled with cojita cheese. It was impressive to look at and tasted even better .            i got the combo plate with carnitas burrito and chile rellano stuffed with steak picado i think thats how u spell it. The chile came with a red sauce and drizziled with sour cream , it was very good. The carnitas burrito was a little dry, jus carnitas and tortilla nothing else in it. Maybe i should have gotten it enchilada style , maybe my fault. The plating again was beautiful, the rice and beans tasty and fresh. I think i saw chef leticia's in the kitchen she looked busy ,if she was not i would have complimented her food , bravo.",

First I must start by saying that my wife makes the best authentic Mexican food around and we tavel to Mexico a lot as well so we are quite picky in this area.  After all the dissappointing experiences and attempts at finding good Mexican food in Vegas we had all but given up...until now!  Leticia's was a pleasant surprise with great food and awesome lunch prices.  It took a little bit to get noticed and seated, but after that the service was great.  There were a lot of items on the restaurant that you just don't see at other Mexican restaurants, and my wife commented about seeing dishes that her mom used to make...and her mom is where she got her skills from so great sign!  The chips and salsa were great, and lots of roasted options and good selection of heat.  My wife had Sopes and I had Carne Asada and Carnitas combo and both were great.  It is a great place for a lunch date or family and friends...we will definitely be back when we don't feel like cooking at home!",

The service was awesome- prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, not over the top.  The food was great, too.  The guacamole w/ jalapenos was fresh and fantastic.  The small was plenty for 2.  My wife had the \"something\" casa chili verde.  The pork was tender, the beans were good.  I had the \"something\" Quesa- their house special.  I had one shrimp taco and one shredded chicken.  It was awesome.  I would get the shredded chicken again and try a different filling instead of the baby shrimp.  Oh, and we each had a margarita that was top shelf ingredients and quite good.  Maybe I'm still a country bumkin' adjusting to big city life, but I thought this place was great.  5 stars for food and service.  3 stars for generic ambience.",

The decor is pleasing to the eye and they have patio dining.  I opted for the inside.  To start, they offer chips with a tomatillo sauce and a darker salsa which was really good.  They also offer a small dish of refried beans.  I ordered the Carnitas plate which comes with your choice of soup (they offered two) or a salad.  I got the salad with the house vinaigrette.  That vinaigrette was fabulous!  The Carnitas plate came with refried beans, rice, guac and pico de gallo.  The pork was fork tender and fragrant.  The corn tortillas were warm.  I totally enjoyed my meal.  The service was good, albeit intrusive.  I like attention to my table, but not so much where everyone was stopping by the table to ask how everything was.  The waiter stopped by, the busboy stopped by, the host stopped by.  I fully expected someone to walk in off the street to stop by and ask about my meal.  I don't know if they have gotten some bad reviews and are trying to rectify the problem.  All told, the experience was good and I am glad I went.  I took a carryout and headed back to my hotel.   I will definitely go to Leticia's Cocina my next trip.",

Friends had recommended the restaurant and it lived up to expectations.  That would be enough, but Leticia's also sponsors community events.  They are having a cinco de mayo festival and concert in the neighborhood on May 6.  It is a great restaurant but they also build the community and get people together around where the restaurant is located.  Again, thank you for what you are doing.  I will eat here again.",

    "text": "My mom was in town for a weeklong visit and we wound up making two trips to Leticia's! The first time we sat at a booth by the bar and a college football game was on so it was a little loud but we could easily carry on a conversation. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering questions, and we were promptly served our beer, waters and chips with salsa trio.  You can choose from family style or individual selections and we each chose seperately. My mom got Guisados de Casa -chile verde which was really good. The pork was super tender without being mushy or fatty and was seasoned well. I got chicken fajitas which were excellent....two people could easily share this. My husband got spicy chicken quesatacos...they were okay but the poblano casserole served alongside was awwwesome.   Our second trip was just as successful. We went on a weeknight and it was much quieter. Our waitress was helpful, although not quite as prompt. Very friendly however! My mom went with spinach and mushroom enchiladas which she liked but I probably wouldn't order...I felt like they needed something to brighten them up and cut the heaviness of the creamy sauce. My husband and I each ordered grilled fish tacos with soft flour tortillas. I have had fish tacos from Ensenada to Costa Maya to Belize and I can say 100% that these were the best I've ever had, and it's hard to top eating them while sitting on a white sand beach with turquoise water staring at you.   The fish was perfectly seasoned and light, super fresh tasting with a perfect fish to sauce ratio. The veggies were also perfectly proportioned and every bite was just as perfect as the first.  We mentioned to the server how much we enjoyed them and she told us on Monday nights their street-sized tacos are all available for 1.25 each!   It's five minutes from our house...super close proximity to pick up after-dinner cupcakes from retro bakery (prior to dinner, retro closes at 7 I think) and both our visits yielded both stellar food and service. This will be a regular stop for us.",

I had to ask 3 times for chip refills. Appetizer took forever to come out. Chimichanga was great!

I've never felt so unwelcomed when walking into a restaurant. BAD FIRST IMPRESSION!!! I was seated fairly quickly but had to wait a while before my drink order was even taken. I was served chips, salsa, and bean dip, thank god because my food took forever to come. And when it did come it was wrong WRONG!!! The server who's name I cannot recall but will post if I remember took care of it though, but not without a little attitude. The food was good but slightly over priced.   Being who I am I still leave a tip, but thought I would also leave a review on here. I will say that I will not be back to this place ever again. It was the first and the last time.  I had already made my mind up when I had to deal with the Hostess. It's unfortunate to have to experience that when I'll I wanted to do was simply have some lunch.    I will end with saying that you should really watch the people you hire and have working for you. Our maybe have a talk with them. If they are not happy with their job they should find another. It's not worth losing business over.",

She was disappointed she didn't order the tacos! The melted cheese is what makes them so good along with the chipotle sauce! I have no complaints and will continue to frequent leticias.

The wait time for 2 was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in the bar area which was a bit more cramped and loud. My drink of Cabo Azul was great! The tortilla chips and 3 sides of salsa were great. The food we ordered was just ok. Nothing great or super fantastic. I ordered shrimp ceviche and the mexican corn. The bf ordered carne asada enchilada. When the food came out is was almost like we read each others minds. Not very thrilling. I guess we were expecting a big old wow factor of taste. One thing that threw me off was the girl who first took our drink orders. She was under 18 so she couldn't bring me an alcoholic beverage which is what I wanted so there was some mix up with who I was supposed to order the drink from and how it was going to get to my table. My mexican corn was like something that I could make at home. The bf's enchilada and sides were a bit dry and overcooked. I think we will skip Leticia's and stick to the regular places that give us a bit more yay when it comes to the food.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are Leticia's regulars, and we are both Hispanic and know good Mexican food when we have it. I have to say the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is what really wins me over. Everyone is so nice, the decor is very appealing, and its just a comforting place to pig out on great food.   The service there is GREAT, I have an attachment to the older man Hector- he is ALWAYS so incredibly friendly and always makes sure that we are all set with chips & salsa and our waters/soda are filled. He is such a sweet heart.   The food...authentic. From the Pozole (which I just had a week ago because I was recovering from a flu and it was SO GOOD. ) to the enchiladas covered in salsa- everything tastes like I went to Mexico. For real. Its some good stuff.   All in all, its a great place to grab dinner and have a few drinks with your friends, family, spouse...whoever. Anyone will love it.   I should be a Leticia VIP hahaha",

We ended up leaving the rest there because it was practically a skillet full of thick, stringy, greasy cheese. Their food was alright but pretty plain, there was not a whole lot of flavor which is what I want when eating at a Mexican restaurant. This was not what we were expecting, but worth a try.  Service was good our server was very kind, but we don't see ourselves ever going back.",

I had to wait literally 30 minutes for my food.  My server was nice and apologized several times for the delay.  When my steak tacos came, they were dry. Luckily, my server Joanne, checked back with me fairly quickly and offered to change my order for something else.  Luckily the replacement order came very quickly. Joanne chatted with me briefly when I finished my meal. I would have liked to see a discount (or even a dessert on the house) placed on my final bill for my inconvenience.  A while back, I went to Red Robin and my burger was overcooked.  Not only did the manager come over and offer me a soup while I waited for a replacement, she took the burger charge off the bill without me asking. This is the service that I come to expect.  I'm not sure if I will return to Leticia's again. I've been to Michocan Gourmet Mexican restaurant twice and both times, I've gone the food and service was excellent.",

The food was nothing great it was exactly the same as my neighbor hood taqurilla but ten times more expensive. I was very upset ruining my husbands dinner.

It took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive It was 2 in the afternoon and it seems like a normal afternoon crowd. The food was okay but when you wait that long with children it is unacceptable. My son in law ordered a side of jalapenos and onions and the waitress brought them out 10 minutes before his food..we didn't have to pay for them because he sent them back.  Tres leche cake was terrible ..only pineapple was used and canned at that. I recommend finding somewhere else to go..",

The bean dip was ok, the red salsa was marginal, and the green salsa tasted like grass. I ordered the Tampiquena--made from top sirloin which sounded interesting. When I attempted to order it medium rare, the waiter tried to explain to me that it could not be cooked to order because it was pre-cooked ( I assume he meant marinated) in lime juice, but he assured me that it was very good. I was presented with a very thin, tough and poorly seasoned piece of beef with some cold, clumpy queso on top of it. Not at all impressed. The enchilada that came with it was ok--but certainly nothing special. Judging from the other reviews here, I either came on the wrong night or ordered the wrong thing. If I happen to be this far north in LV again, I might give it another shot.",

Staff seemed like we were bothering them by wanting a water refill and more chips. One of our party did not get her food until the rest of us were done eating AND we had to ask for her food 3 times. They kept checking, but never came back.   The food quality was not as good either, even with higher prices.   Sadly it's just not worth going there anymore.",

    "text": "After reading many reviews of this place, I decided to stop by here for lunch and try it for myself.  I was please to see how nice the decor of the restaurant was.  There are two dining room areas and bar seating.  The owner, Leticia, greeted me and asked me if I wanted a table or sit at the bar.  Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.    I decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!  A few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...  Overall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.  Will I return?  I want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes.",

I am giving 2 stars only because there were some good even great times but the last visit just destroyed all the past. This last time I came in with a 6 so a good size table. I ordered one of my favorites, tostatas but when served, it tasted stale and the appearance looked as if the food was old. My mother and uncle ordered the same thing and it was soggy, bot cooked well and cool, not hot. My husband's order was also cold and he said it tasted old as well. My aunt's order was also cold but also had a bit of rubber feel. When we talked to the waitress, she told us it was because they had a new cook. She did not offer to fix or replace any of our meals. Weeks later, I was watching the news and they were on dirty dining with a C rating based on a lot of thr complaints I listed. I won't go back there and I hope the owners fix this issue.",

The check said jalapeno margarita $8 + $1 for strawberry.  Not sure why i was charged the extra dollar.  I also ordered the fish tacos which were $13 on the menu the check showed $13 + $1 for Fish. excuse me? you charged me a dollar for fish when i ordered fish tacos?? lastly the fish tacos came with ONE wedge (for 2 large tacos) of lime which had not one drop of juice so i showed the waiter the lemon was dry and asked him for a replacement.  He took so long my tacos got cold and i ended up using the lime from my margarita cup instead.  He finally showed and apologized for the long wait.  I noticed on my bill i was charged $0.75 for lime :-/ Not cool.  The food was pretty good and the place is close to our house but we will not be returning. Makes me wonder how many suckers (like us) are paying the misc fees without even noticing.  I doubt we will be returning.  CHECK YOUR BILL EVERYONE!!!!!",

My favorite is the molcajete fajitas with flat-iron steak and chicken. The sweet cactus that supplements this fun dish is a great substitute for the normal bell peppers in fajita dishes and the presentation makes for a great conversation piece. As far as the normal Mexican food selection goes, the carnitas is what I get when I am in the mood for the more traditional meal. Always great, but getting through the door can be a challenge. 40-70 minute waits are not uncommon. Hence the ding to 3 stars.",

The first time was fabulous and inline with the overall score this place gets on Yelp. Our waiter was very helpful in navigating their somewhat complicated menu and process. It all turned out well. The second time we went was a tragedy. We arrived with friends for a double-date night, signed in and waited outside with lots of other people waiting as well. After a half hour and noticing other, new tables getting seated before us, I enquired of the hostess what the deal was and found out that we'd been totally skipped on the list about ten patrons ago. After expressing my displeasure, we still waiting about five minutes, then on the way to the table, my friend fell due to water on the floor. Apologies? Manager rush over to gush on us? Nope...just a, \"Sit here\" in a booth a little too small for four grown adults. The food was still good though. Third time, tie breaker, we arrived on a Sunday after church and sat outside and it wasn't very busy. This time the service was prompt and the food delicious. The beautiful weather on the small deck didn't hurt either. So, that's why I'll let the \"tie go to the runner\" and give a four. We'll see what the next visit delivers. My advice? Go when it's not super busy to ensure a good trip.",

I truly felt Letcia's was better Mexican than Lindo Michoacan (which I gave 4 stars), but being located up in Centennial I can't see myself visiting unless I happen to be in the area.  My party of 8 waited for 45 min on a busy Friday night and were seated outdoors.  Chips and 3 kinds of dip/salsa were brought to the table in a timely manner after we ordered our drinks.  i ordered a taco combo plate of both ground beef and carne asada with the standard beans and rice sides.  The hearty helping came in a double wrapped soft tortilla which I thought was genius so everything doesn't rip through on the first bite.  I felt overall the tacos had a bit more flavoring than Lindo for about the same price point.  I just wish this place was closer!!!",

My boyfriend and I thought we finally found a worthwhile Mexican restaurant near us.   Sadly, our most recent experience is probably going to be our last experience for a while.  The server seemed a little overwhelmed and we saw more of the busboy then anyone else.  Being a Tuesday night it wasn't jam packed.  Our burritos were beyond mediocre and I could've made a better one at home.     The menu is a little pricy for Mexican food.  What we were once okay paying, now seems like a rip off.

    "text": "This was my favorite Mexican restaurant and everything was so good, so similar to how my family cooks. My step grandma cooked food similar when she was alive and this was the closest to that and my moms Mexican cooking.   But somehow it's lost its way for me. Look at my previous reviews over the years to look at the trend.  It's become inconsistent. It's better during daytime, probably because the owner is there. There are times also for dinner the food is SO salty, SO greasy. Servers are either wonderfully attentive and super friendly or horrible and will never check on you at all. Horchata is sometimes perfectly creamy and spiced and sometimes so cinnamony. It's like being at 2 different restaurants.   Thinking back, out of the last 6 visits, once both the food and service wasn't good, 2 visits the food was good and service wasnt, 2visits where the food was bad and the service was good, 1 visit where food was amazing and service was too. Most of the good food was earlier in the day. These 6 visits have been the past year, I've gone less and less when we used to come frequently.  They also raised their prices from opening to now, by quite a bit. Most of my favorite dishes have gone up $3 since I first started coming here a few years ago. I like the food and probably would still frequent even with their raises every year if it was still as good consistently, but I think some of the items are priced too high for what they are, they are definitely higher than most competitors aside from Lindo which also prices rather high.   Go during lunch as they tend to be better then. Also it's cheaper so that if you were iffy about the food, you just didn't pay $15 for 2 enchiladas.   What is (usually) good here is the carnitas, the chile verde, the mole poblano, enchiladas and I think their mocajete is solid.   I just wish they would up their standards a little bit again. I might look for a new Mexican food place.",

    "text": "I hate doing this, but I feel it needs to be said.   Firstly, I love Leticia's. By love, I mean we eat here a lot. By a lot, I mean we frequent this place at least once a month. That's a lot for me.   The reason for this update is the service. We sit at the bar because we like to play for free drinks. And it's usually just my boyfriend and I. Otherwise, we'll sit at a table. And I have almost always had a bad experience when we're seated. The waiters/waitresses seem so rushed, so annoyed and just generally pretty rude. I hate being biased and I have been for way too long. They are seriously lacking on how to treat clients. They rarely check on you, take forever to get you food or drinks. If I'm here with a smaller or larger party,  it's made no difference. Each time, we have been waiting too long or just had a server that doesn't seem too keen about helping us.   The bartenders are awesome. They have a few new ones that have been excellent. The food each time has come out perfectly and delicious as always. The main reason we come to this place.  Now, I hate referring people here. Each time, they say the same thing. They loved the food but hated the service.   So, I give you 3 stars - for the servers, please...do not ruin such a great place. For the food, drinks and bartenders - I give you 5 stars.",

Their fajitas have a sophisticated flair with the added mushrooms and rich yet fresh flavors. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the price... A little steep.",

We wanted to go somewhere some what nice and we've heard a lot about this restaurant. We were seated immediately - which was great. But, we didn't have a server approach our table for about 15 mins. There were only three tables including ours in our whole area.. Soo not sure what took so long. After our server finally came and took our order - we did not receive our food for about 30 mins after that.. Our order was small and simple, and yet everything we got was wrong. For an appetizer we ordered elote - which NEVER even came to our table. I ordered a chicken burrito with guac and pico - I received a chicken burrito with those ingredients PLUS unwanted sour cream and jalapenos inside. My husband ordered a carne asada burrito chimichanga style - he received a carne asada burrito enchilada style.. For someone that doesn't like a lot of sauce, that's horrible. Being hungry and frustrated, and no server in sight - we ate what was given to us. Later, the servers station was directly behind our table, and we could hear her saying we did not receive our elote. She came to our table to present us with our check, pretended to look around our table and asked \"oh? You did not receive your elote?\" No mam.. And to your surprise we know Spanish and heard you saying you knew we didn't. Don't really appreciate playing dumb. She proceeded to open our check and show that she did not charge us for it. Again, obviously you knew - don't appreciate the act. How about apologizing - or at least asking if we still wanted it or not before removing it off our check?! On the check we were also charged additional fees for the unwanted toppings we never asked for. No idea what her name was - our busser referred to her as Flaca.. I'll at least give a shout out to our busser, who did a great job covering our servers butt refilling our drinks and chips and making sure we had to go boxes. Overall, my husband and I were debating on $5 Little Cesars and decided we should have something nice - I'd rather have the $5 Little Cesars than this $50 crap experience. No graicias.",

Finally ordered and it took more than 45 minutes to get the food since our waitress became the bartender halfway through the meal.   We went up to get the hostess to complain and she sent the manager over. All the managers did was stop by to say, \"I don't know what's going on, I'll see\". No apologies, no check in, no followup, no listening. Terrible management skills. Thank goodness for Luciano listening and checking because the manager was terrible.   The food was delicious.

The new policy is if you pay by credit card, the price will go 3% higher!  Our favorite chips and dips are not as good as before!  I ordered Beef fajitas costs $19. We expected the tastes should be good but unfortunately it tastes so fishy! My husband order shrimp fajitas will add $3 more but the shrimp tastes not fresh!  We are not going back this restaurant any more",

    "text": "My family and I came to Leticias after a morning at the pumpkin patch. We had yet to find our spot in the vegas valley for good Mexican food, so we went into this restaurant with open minds. We were greeted by friendly faces, and immediately brought to our table. They brought out a basket of chips (absolutely delicious ones) and 3 dipping options. There was a red salsa, a green salsa, and a bean dip. Both of the salsas were delicious and my daughter scarfed down the bean dip. The menu was large and impressive. Lots of options for all.   My husband ordered the Nacho plate with carne Assad.  The portion was massive, and the plate was overflowing with delicious toppings. I am not a meat eater, so I didn't not try the steak- but he kept talking about how deliciously seasoned and tender the carne Assad was. He really enjoyed his dish, and had plenty more to take home.   I ordered a build your own burrito. I found it to be slightly pricy- because I ordered mine with out any meat. BUT, with that said, I would come back and order it again and again. It was massive. It was so tasty, and I couldn't get over the size. I  got my burrito smothered  in green sauce, which I would totally recommend for any green sauce lovers out there. The beans and rice served with my burrito was equally as delicious. That's saying a lot because I'm not one for Spanish rice. I find most restaurants make it so mushy, but this rice was flavorful and had great texture. Obviously, I was not able to finish my burrito in one sitting.   My four year old ordered off the kids menu and she enjoyed all that was on her plate. Again, the portions were impressive and we had enough to take home as another meal for her.   I would come back here in a heart beat. I live on the opposite side of town so I'm sad that I'm not closer to this yummy spot. I'm certain the next time we get an itch for Mexican food we will gladly make the drive out from Henderson just to experience their yummy food again. Thank you for such a great experience!",

We ordered elote corn,  a cheese quesedilla and a horchata.  the horchata was too sweet so I traded it for a soda.    The salsas were good but the chips tasted odd. The food took a while to be delivered to the table. The cheese in the quesedilla was too salty.  The elote arrived about five minutes later and was cold.  The service itself was pleasant.

We haven't been here in a month or so... online it says it's $13 for two cheese enchiladas so I ordered it. When I arrived they said the total to me before swiping my card.. And i thought I heard $14 something.. when I went to go sign it, it was $18.34. For two cheese enchiladas... I walked out because I didn't want to give the guy a hard time. Walking to my car I decided to walk back in and ask exactly what I had paid for because he never gave an itemized receipt. The nice girl at the hostess stand showed the menu and said \"that's weird, looks like we changed our menus and upped the price\". I said.. hmmm okay. And went home. I ate the first half earlier and the other half just now... as I'm finishing I see something in my enchilada.... A LONG PIECE OF METAL! This is absolutely disgusting! I can't believe this.. I've only ever written 1 review here before and that was a few years ago... I'm just SO DISSAPOINTED, and grossed out. How could they let this happen?  P.S I know this is really gross i hate seeing pics of food like this but this just had to be posted.. gross.  Really disappointed in you leticias.",

I am a San Diego native transplant to Vegas: anyone who has ever been or lived in San Diego knows what \"Real\" mexican food tastes like. 2. I am a super picky meat eater. Can not have bones, fat or Gristle...make me gag! 3. LOVE MEXICAN FOOD!!! With that being said...Leticias is heaven sent!  We have been searching for a Mexican restaurant that is worth the money, not americanized, and tastes like it was made with love! The way for me to tell if is going to be good is at the very beginning with the chips and salsa...which at Leticias are always fresh and the salsa is flavorful with a hint of spice. They also serve them with a bean dip that must have chorizo in them...DELICIOUS!!!!  Which brings me to the next most important items...Beans and rice!!!  When I order my favorite dish here my rice is a casserole! White rice, cheese and chilies...OMG...delicious...just the right amount of chilies and cheesy goodness! I have the shrimp Quesa  tacos, medium heat!  My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Packed full of shrimp, melted cheese and the flavor...wow..I have tried them spicy also...and I like spicy usually ...but medium for me was perfect. My man orders the Mojcaete...a hot bowl with ranchera sauce, shrimp, queso, carne asada and cactus...served with rice and beans and tortillas...it is a huge bowl of yummy goodness and you can't get any more authentic than this dish!!! We have been several times...NEVER left unhappy. ALWAYS delicious. We have tried other dishes...but now we go for these 2 dishes! Well worth the drive and every single dollar we spend. Finally a place that may even be better than San Diego mexican food!!! :)",

The set up is nice, beautiful decor. I've given it many opportunities. It's always super busy & frankly I don't know why. The food is not quality whatsoever. Canned beans. Cheap meat. Need I say more? Once we were sitting at a booth & a lady with extremely long hair was sitting on the other side of the booth behind us.. I mean this lady was the brunette Rapunzel, she placed her hair over our booth. So her hair was literally between my sister & I. We asked her nicely to remove her hair when nothing was done, we brought it to the waitress' attention. trust me I know she is probably very limited as to what she can do but she looked at us, saw the hair, & said there was nothing she could do.",

Birthday boy ordered the chicken fajitas which he loved. The sizzling chicken came with mushrooms and bell peppers and onions and then on the side was fresh tortillas, rice, beans, guacamole & pico de gallo. Huge platter.

But then things started to go downhill in the food quality and we stopped going.  After a couple of years we decided to give them a try again.  The food has improved again.  The service has always been good.  We love some of their speciality margaritas.  The reason for the 3-stars is price.  Much more than we pay at some of our other favorite restaurants so we only come here on occasion.",

    "text": "One star is given only for the busboy(?) who brought us water and chips & salsa.  For everything else, I would give zero stars if possible.  We ate there last night.  Should have known to go somewhere else when they weren't busy at 7:15 pm.  After we were seated, it was 20 minutes before we could place our order. Then waited nearly 40 min for our food.  One order was for the Ensenada tacos, no rice only beans. Menu said they had fish & shrimp.  Yeah, only greasy fried fish. The other order was for shredded beef tacos.   My plate came first.  There was a molded circular glob on my plate. I asked the waitress what it was....some type of cheesy rice. I looked inside the tacos as I didn't see any cabbage. As I lifted the tortilla (with my bare hands), the waitress said \"oops, they gave me the the wrong plate in the kitchen\" and took it.  Yes, I touched the food. No, I in no way believe they made a fresh plate for the table it belonged to.  My wife's plate came out next.  She also used her bare hand to look inside her tacos.  Yep, wrong plate again.  I am wondering who got the food our hands were on. More on that later.  The shredded beef tacos were good.  The fish tacos had burnt batter on the outside, mushy on the inside and barely a sliver of fish.  They were thoughtful to put a single 1/8th slice of lime on the plate.  The beans were so salty that they were inedible.   The practice of taking a plate back that the food was touched by the customer and then serving it to someone else may not be a health code violation, but it should be.  I was really hoping that we had found a locally owned Mexican restaurant that was close to our home, but we didn't.  The $37 we spent would have bought a lot of food at Taco Bell and Taco Bell would have been better.  We won't be back.",

The restaurant was pretty packed, which I thought was a good sign, but booyy was I wrong. I'll get right into it..  The waitress brought out drinks fairly quickly and there was already a basket of chips with salsa waiting on the table when we were seated. The salsa was good, but the chips were terrible. They were super thick and tasted stale. We ordered the chicken tamales and carne asada burrito. The order took quite some time to come out. I don't know exactly how long, but two tables that were seated well after us, both received their orders before us. Anyways, the tamales were dry. That's the best way to put it. They were dry, crumbly, and tasteless. The rice that came on the side was laughable, looking AND tasting like it came out of a dang rice a roni box. Next up..We had asked for grilled vegetables in the burrito, but instead we got raw zucchini. We were also up-charged for the guacamole we asked for but never got on the burrito. We didn't make a fuss about it, because at that point we were desperate to get out of the restaurant. Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

But that's the only good thing they did. After being seated and getting our beverages. It took 30 mins  for the waitress to comeback to take our order.   We waited, and waited and waited. In the mean time other customers were being seated and eventually served, a few even finished eating. By this time the whole restaurant was full. We kindly asked the bus person, and the waitress about our food. Finally the manager came to our table and told us he was going to check on our food.   By this time it had been ONE hour and THIRTY mins since our order was taken. The manager came back and kindly said that our food was still not ready.   He did offer to comp our bill. But that didn't resolve our food not being ready after almost two hours. This is the first time I've walked out of a restaurant. To think that I've praised Leticia's for years makes me even angrier.   Thank you Leticia's Mexican Cocina.",

He was great and had our orders done correctly but during the hour and a half only two of seven got our drinks refilled. By the time he came back around to our table we were ready for the check. Maybe they need more servers if he was the only one servicing both sides and outside of the restaurant?",

I had a breakfast burrito and my wife had chicken tamales. The chips were great and came with three different salsas.   The service was also excellent, however there were only about five other customers since we were there so early.   If this was located closer to my house I would be here all the time. I will have to settle for stopping by whenever I am lured to the northwest part of town",

Things that need improving would be room in the restaurant and waiting area, more lights, enchiladas and drink specials. Other than that not a bad place for lunch , gets busy for dinner. Lunch is much cheaper than dinner if anyone is looking for the best deals.",

Asked for manager again. Finally the rest came out. Food was ok. The kids meal came with dessert: churros. Hard as rocks.  Manager never came out to check on us. Had to ask for bill; then find someone to run the card. The table next to us NEVER  received their bar drinks. They asked 2 different servers and the manager...they never came.

The sauces they make for enchiladas and such are incredible, I had the chicken mole enchiladas and they were amazing.  I have also tried all kinds of dishes of others and they were all good.  The bad experience I had was the time I went with some real picky eaters, we had all kinds of special requests and the waiter was rude and basically said that they couldn't figure it out.  Then the meal came completely wrong (surprise).  Also on another occasion a guest got carnitas and it was just big chunks of fat (and I eat carnitas all the time).    They do have a deal on fridays I think when you can get 1.50 street style tacos and they are awesome.  If looking for mexican in vegas try this spot and also Via Mercados, both are worth trying.",

One place might have the best chips & salsa, as other places have better margaritas, while another place might have the best fish tacos.    With that being said, Leticia's definitely has the best Carnitas in Vegas.  Overall, I think their food is excellent.  They have some of the most tender, flavorful Carnitas I have ever eaten.  I've also had their Carne Asada burrito and the Milanesa; both where the steak was also tender and flavorful, and not tough and chewy.  I've had better chips & salsa at other places, but I can't complain when it's free (part of the meal).  Of the numerous visits, I've only had one visit with slow service, and our food took 30 minutes to come out from the time we ordered.  All other visits, the service was great and the food came out fast.  Prices are decent for lunch specials, but I haven't eaten dinner there yet. I haven't been disappointed with the food there yet, and I would recommend this place to anyone.  It is located way up in the Northern part of Vegas, so it's not conveniently located (unless you live up there).  But if you love Carnitas, then you have to check out Leticia's.",

I will give any business who takes the time to support our community a spin.   We went as a family and found the food of average quality for the price. The wait staff was attentive but the kitchen was slow. Then the karaoke started up and we just wanted to eat as quick as possible and leave. On a summer night starting the amateur songbirds at 8 sharp when families are still dining together felt chaotic.   This place is close to our house so we will give it another spin when it is not karaoke night. Perhaps on a a Tuesday when I can't help but smell the fajitas they make on the patio when I drive by.",

They don't win the best taco award for no reason!!! Everything on the menu is super great. Usually I order the smothered taquitos or some enchiladas! If not then a huge bowl of child verde with pork and flour tortillas!!!! I do suggest to make reservations because this place is always packed!",

We ordered fajitas for 2, but there was barely 4 ounces of meat, mostly onions. I easily cook better than the food here. Oh so of course you can add 1 back because of the cost. NO, it was $18, that's right $18 per person; a total of $36. There are many other places where you can get much better, for less.",

Last night my husband ordered a small cauldron of bubbling goo. This was supposed to be fajitas. Melted cheese was on the bottom but there was no way to extract the cheese through all the liquid goo. A huge slab of flank steak was balanced over the side of the bowl. There were supposed to be shrimps wrapped in bacon. The waiter said they were in the bowl. They were not. Long story short, I'm not going to Leticia's anymore. It's taken me years to realize that I'm a On The Border Tex-Mex girl!  I simply don't like this real Mexican food!",

We like to call it \"Mexican gourmet,\" but there's a comfort level that goes beyond gourmet.  From the time you walk in, until the time you leave, you're treated like family.  You'll see regulars, tourists, and celebrities (Carlos Santana eats here!!!!), all treated the same by the lovely Leticia.    Fair warning, the free salsa/beans and chips are HIGHLY addictive!  I can't even count the number of times that we've had to take home the majority of our entree because we filled up on the margaritas and chips & salsa.  I would seriously hurt someone to get her tomatillo salsa recipe.  Seriously.  You can have my firstborn.    Don't be afraid to ask your server for recommendations.  Or the person at the next table, if their food looks interesting.",

However every time since has been disappointing. I have tried a variety of menu items hoping to find something worth coming back to but its just \"okay\". The staff is all over the place running around, one night a waiter ran around the corner booth and kicked an empty chair in his rush and it flew right into my fathers leg, it was hard enough that my father said \"ouch\". He made eye contact with our table grabbed the chair from the floor and walked away without even acknowledging the fact he hit a customer. I know he was aware of it because he went and told the manager about the incident right in front of the kitchen window, we were seated two booths over so we were able to see & hear the conversation happen. Not the waiter or manager came over to make sure he was okay or apologize for the incident. We let the incident go and even returned tonight giving it a last chance. My husbands dinner was not as he ordered it and his said his margarita was terrible, unfortunately we will not be returning.",

I proceeded to eat some of the chipotle salsa and there was a hair about 10 inches long, that I had to pull out of my mouth. I asked my server whose name was Duke, about it, and he told me it was a chile strand and it happens all the time. he refused to to acknowledge what had happened, and did not apologize. We then tried to order off of the happy hour menu, and he told me because it was New Years Eve they were not honoring the happy hour menu, when we called two hours earlier and the hostess and told us they were having it. So we proceeded to leave, it was the worst customer service I have ever received. I did have a couple other experiences at Leticia's, that were quite enjoyable. Although, I will not eat here again, the hair experience was a total turn off.",

    "text": "Very disappointing. No flavor. Terrible service. The waiter practically threw the chips at us on his way by. Had shrimp tacos but there were MAYBE 1 little shrimp in each. Had to dig to find and even then when I say little I mean... these were THE SMALLEST shrimps on the planet. My husband had the carne asada burrito. Blah! Zero flavor. Had to add the habenero salsa or it would have tasted like nothing. WAY over priced for the low quality and very low service. Great building, street shopping theme, but terrible parking. Will not return.",

    "text": "I think my father summed it up well, he's never before left a Mexican joint not full of beans and rice. It was weird how there was so little of each and the rice had cold clumps. I got the impression we got leftover rice reheated. I'm not a temperature freak either, but sorry, it was cold.  I find it bizarre that this place has so many peachy reviews on other sites. Taco Bell definitely has nothing to worry about.",

I hear they will be offer the taquiza cart for the \"Movie In The Park\" events this summer. They have good Sunday brunch deals and happy hour.  I believe they also have karaoke on Saturday nites.",

    "text": "I really liked the chips! They are made out of flour tortillas and were very crispy. I was really impressed with the menu and all the options. They have deserts which I have not seen offered at other Mexican restaurants, such as Capirotada (Mexican bread pudding). The server was happy to make recommendations and frequently checked in to ask of the meal was and if I needed anything else. I ordered an horchata and loved it. It was served in a huge glass (no refill needed) and so authentic, like the kind made at our family functions. It tried the Taquiza (Mexican Street Tacos) in chicken, carne asada and al pastor. They were all really great and will be back again to have them. I also had two tamales, Green Sauce Chicken and Rajas Con Queso. Unfortunately, I did not like the tamales, kinda of dry even though I got them \"Enchilada\" style. My server had mentioned that she did not care from them and that they were dry, prior to me placing the order. I appreciate her honesty and she was right. I will come back to sample more items and for the Taquiza.",
