Every dish is on point. The food here does not even compare to the Vietnamese food in San Jose. I will definitely take my girlfriend to D1 on our next trip to Vegas.",

House Oysters are a must have also !!!! I've visited here three times and have almost had everything on the menu. So far, so good...no complaints on the food. However, BEWARE of the bar! Drink knowledge is far below acceptable, so don't be upset when you don't get what you want...or they have no idea how to make your favorite cocktail. Yet if you like soda water in your old fashioned, this is the bar for you (Hah). Four stars for great food and atmosphere. Minus one star for lousy bar.",

Now, District One anchors it.  It has a sports-bar ambience serving Vietnamese fusion dishes but their dishes do not deviate too much away from the basic Vietnamese food.  They're still your traditional Vietnamese dishes, they just add a little something something and modernize them a bit.    Everything on their menu is very good.  I've tried just about everything on their menu, except that am not a big fan of their overpriced lobster pho.  For some reason, that doesn't appeal to me at all.  I've been to HCM more than once and I don't remember seeing lobster pho being served in the real District One of Ho Chi Minh City.  If they do, I must've missed it or never saw the restaurant that serves it.    Anyway, I sometimes think some people order them here just to show-off and make the people next table a bit inferior and impoverished (LOL).   Just imagine you enjoying and slurping on a regular $9.99 pho then out of the pantry you see lobster antennae, claws and tail sticking out of, and placed so deliberately, on a smaller bowl to make them look bigger being delivered to the table next to you, among other things.   I tend to always order either their big bone soup or oxtail pho,  or garlic noodles and garlic serrano wings.     District One is a must visit joint!  The staff is friendly, the place is clean and trendy-ish with good music in the background. And of course, it doesn't hurt when the food IS damn good!",

I ordered the oxtail rice and grilled squid and they were great. Service was great as well!  Second visit. I had spring rolls, garlic noodles, steak and rice, and a shrimp skewer. The spring rolls + dipping sauce were good, they have a surprise crunch -from a fried egg roll wrap(?). The garlic noodles and steak had a great flavor profile, just a tad heavy handed on the salt/fish sauce, other than that, great! The shrimp skewer is one shrimp on a skewer, I had it grilled. It was seasoned perfectly, not too much salt. Our server, Louisa was also pleasant, 5 stars for her!  My 2 stars comes from the bar. As we were dining, a song came on that prompted the bartender, Janelle, to say \"No! No, turn this shit off. I'm sick of hearing this child molester!\" When we asked her why she said that, she quickly changed her tone when she realized she shouldn't have said that. She said \"Those weren't my words, they were the customers, I was just repeating them.\" Firstly, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Secondly, it is not okay for an employee, in any circumstance, to \"repeat\" outwardly things a guest may or may not have said. She could have politely asked for her coworker just to change the song, or walked over to change it herself instead of yelling over the bar. Third, I was sitting at a table near the bar and facing her the entire time. The comment came from her, the two gentlemen sitting in front of her did NOT say anything in regards to the music. I dislike dishonesty, if you want to say something, own it. Do not put the blame on a guest when you realize you were in the wrong for saying it in the first place.",

We had Oxtail pho, Beef ball pho, chicken wings, garlic fries, Wonton Noodle, Spring rolls, Pork buns and Spicy beef noodle. Beef ball tasted like it was homemade, definitely a plus. The chicken wings were on point. I was little disappointed in the spicy beef noodle; it was missing that spice, again it's a fusion restaurant I shouldn't put too much into this noodle, as it takes one of a kind restaurant to get it right. Lastly, I got the \"Big Bone\" soup, as saw the waiter bring it from the across the restaurant my mouth drop as it holds True to its name THE BIG BONE. It was it bone with lots of bone marrow which I took a straw to suck the marrow out. The soup was not salty but full of onions, yet so good. It took about 6 of us which me, my brother in law, my husband, two sisters in laws and my son to somewhat finish this. We be back for another round of the Big Bone Soup, pho, chicken wings,Spring rolls, garlic fries, but pass on the Spicy beef noodle.",

    "text": "*EDC WEEK/ LATE REVIEW*  I would've rated this place higher if i haven't called 5-10 minutes before I arrived confirming if they had the bone marrow and was lied to. Considering I was only visiting Vegas and was really looking forward to this meal I am beyond lost for words on how whoever picked up the phone straight up lied to me.   On Monday after picking up around rental car we decided to go to District One based on the many recommendations we got from friends and online. When we got there, I asked for the big bone soup which they said they didn't have. I was fine with that considering they told me to come earlier on Wednesday (I flew out Wednesday night) cause they are closed on Tuesday. Fine. So we ordered the oxtail fried rice, baby bak choi, garlic serrano wings, pho tai nam and the pho oxtail. All were nothing short of amazing but I reaaaaaaally wanted the bone marrow.   Fast forward to Wednesday, I call the restaurant to confirm they have it so I don't waste my time and money going there and they don't have, the female who picked up the phone said \"they have it at the time of the call but they don't have the lobster\" fine I didn't want the lobster anyways. So I call a uber and rush over to district One, ask for the a table for two and then was told they didn't have the big bone pho at all, and didn't have it all day.   Are you kidding me. I literally rushed over full of joy and left with nothing but hated and a tummy empty of bone marrow :(. It's alright though, I went to Hobak BBQ (review to come) and that was one easily of the best korean meals I've ever had I am still hoping for the next time I come to Vegas they still have this so I can try it :(.  I'm coming back to Vegas in May hopefully it's available then. Will update",

    "text": "Always pass by this place on my way to the house. Every time I drove by I mentally noted that I wanted to try it. Well it was about time I put that thought into action. I came with a group of four during happy hour and we were greeted and sat by our server. We knew this was going to be to try the drinks but we figured we grab some finger food while we drink. I ordered the pork belly buns, an order of the chicken wings and Eggrolls. The chicken wings didn't really have a lot of flavor but they were very crispy and had a jalapenos roasted on top of it. I wouldn't really say they're anything special. The pork belly bun and the eggrolls were a 10. Definitley great finger food. The service was a little slower but it was slammed and there was really like four people on the floor. The bar was packed because the drinks are soooo good ! We came on national margarita day and they were having a special on them. The Thai basil margarita was very refreshing. We also ordered the coconut mojito! MUST TRY COCONUT MOJITO! So good and they serve it in a fresh coconut! I also ordered the cafe sua da which is viatnemese drip coffee with hennnesy and I asked for the condensed creme on the side! It was a perfect after dinner drink! The drinks are worth returning ! Service was great and the soundtrack is FIRE",

    "text": "I've been eating at District One regularly since I moved to Vegas. There's something about D1 that keeps drawing me back. Other than the food, I'm not sure if it's the spacious layout of the restaurant or if it's the trendy casual vibe I feel as soon as I enter. But either way, they found a regular customer in me!  They're mostly known for the Pho but the rest of the menu is amazing! If you're willing to splurge a little extra, your server will bring a Specials Chalkboard to your table with some options for you but otherwise, you'll probably be very satisfied with their menu!   TO SHARE:  Spring Rolls- Personally was never a fan of spring rolls until I tried the ones here. The rolls taste so fresh that I sometimes tell myself that I'm eating healthy whenever I order these. I also like to ask for no mint just because it tastes too strong but otherwise, I can eat them all day.   Oxtail Fries- VERY generous with the oxtail meat and the fries. That's all you need to know!  ENTREE:  Rice Combo Platter- You get rice, an egg cooked to your preferred taste, sliced Taiwanese sausages, and you get the option of either pork chop or short rib. I HIGHLY recommend asking for both and paying extra! They're BOTH so good that no one should have to choose between one or the other. With a hungry stomach, you'll be able to finish the plate and feel quite full/happy. But if you're not that hungry, I would suggest asking for both meats and sharing it with someone else or taking the rest! It'll be more than enough.   Never had an issue with service. They know what they're doing!  Can't wait to go back soon!",

Still i respect a restaurant that only serve what they can handle. We got the oxtail pho and double down instead. The pho is very clean and lighter than i expected even with all the ingredients. Overall the meal is very good. The service was attentive and they told us there will be more bone marrow pho on Tuesday!

Once you're done, ask them to cut it in half to get to all the glorious meat! Make sure you get the grilled whole squid! The seasoning on it is perfect and the shichimi (I think?) mayo matches so well. Anything with oxtail is a hit for me here, including oxtail loco moco and oxtail fries. Bone marrow soup is delicious, with some gigantic bones. Ask for extra broth if you end up running out.   Love hanging out here with friends, and will continue coming back for sure.",

    "text": "Asian Fusion in Vegas?!! Now I can get my fix when I am on vacay, YES!   Food:  During my visit here, my friend and I shared the oxtail fries, half a dozen house special oysters and we both got our own order of the Pho tai rib eye. Call us piggies, we have NO SHAME!   Oxtail Fries: COMFORT FOOD ALERT The oxtail fries definitely hit the spot, it kind of reminded me of Chinese beef stew but they substituted the cubed potatoes for french fries. YOU MUST FINISH IT WHEN DINING IN. Since we got a little carried away with ordering, we had to to-go most of it and let's just say it did not look pretty. The sauce became clumpy when it cooled, so i just ate the oxtail and threw away the rest.   House special oyster:  The oysters were super yummy and fresh. I do not remember the actual name and description the waitress gave us but GET THIS! All I remember about this dish is it had a tangy sauce and fish eggs on top. Hopefully this helps :/ !  Pho tai rib eye:  I love PHO and this place knows how to make it right. The soup tasted really good and tasted of little to no MSG. The noodles  were also cooked perfectly. My only complaint about this dish was that the texture of the beef slices were inconsistent. Some were extremely tender, while others were really tough so I was so pretty sad about that.   Service: Our waitress was really attentive and helpful. It was our first time here and she went through the menu/ specials with us and also came by to refill our waters a couple times.     Final Verdict: I will definitely be back for the oysters/ oxtail fries and not to mention their pork belly buns! Let's see if this place tops the LA version at Dip's Grill.. we will have to just wait and see !",

For food I ordered the double down with short rib. Didn't have the strength to sweat through a bowl of pho, though my friends got some and said it was good. The double down was tasty and a good amount of food. I hate overcooked meat, which I feel like I always get with rice or noodle dishes, but these short ribs were juicy and flavorful. And love me a fried egg on top! Overall a good meal and a cool space.",

    "text": "Interesting concept and a hidden gem in Las Vegas Chinatown.  Food: We weren't particularly too hungry this day so we ordered the Garlic Serrano Wings and Steak and Eggs. I've been to a restaurant in the past where they served a dish similar to the steak and eggs so I was pretty excited about this dish. Although all around it was good, it wasn't noteworthy. The beef was a little bit on the tough side, but the flavor made up for that. As for the rice that came alongside it, it definitely lacked some flavor. The Garlic Serrano wings were also subpar. These little wings didnt much meat clinging to the bones and the flavor was lacking as well. The flavors sounded really good on paper, but to be honest I probably won't order this again. I really wanted to try their famous Lobster Pho, but that will have to be ordered during my next visit.   Environment/ambiance: The restaurant itself is placed in the middle of what looks like an old school Asian plaza. The decor is new and different, almost screaming that it's modern next to its neighbors. On a sunny day you can't miss it---it shines in the sun. Indoors it looks like it used to be a Boiling Crab. They do a good job of representing their seafood theme. It's cozy, a little musty, and the only thing missing is nearby seawater. There's booths along the walls and a few tables for large groups in the middle.   Service: We came early during the lunch hour so we were seated right away. We were also attended to right away by our server, but he didn't do much talking. It would've been helpful if he explained the menu more (although I already had in mind what I wanted to order so no explanation needed).  Tips: This is definitely a place to eat, drink, watch a game, and hang out with friends. It got pretty busy as it got later during the lunch rush. They have different menu items than other restaurants so give it a try!",

We had to wait for a few minutes for a table which was bearable thanks to all their flat screen TV's with the OKC game on.  Pork Belly Buns: Braised pork belly with sauce, peanuts and cilantro. This was tasty and fatty. 4/5  Soft Shell Crab: Big pieces of deep-fried soft shell crab with a dipping sauce. 4/5  Lobster Pho: Here's a dish you won't see at most Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. The broth was quite tasty. They serve the whole lobster with head, claws and tail - the body and claws have been de-shelled so all you have to do is eat and enjoy. Market price for when I went was $32. 4.5/5  Mi Sate: A big bowl of egg noodles and beef in peanut sauce. It tastes like Filipino kare-kare but much watery and with noodles. 3.5/5  District One Rice Combo Platter: Short ribs (or you can get pork chop), kimchi, fried egg, Chinese sausage, and rice. A big plate that will not leave you hungry. The short ribs were flavorful and grilled. 4/5  The place seems like a good place to hang out at. The bar looks promising and I was watching the bartender interact with people at the bar during commercials - the people at the bar seemed pleased. They do serve alcohol, Vietnamese coffee, soda, etc. Our server, Tien was alright. He forgot to check on our drinks though. A different server gave us our check and asked if we wanted refills - too late! Tien came back to offer is refills - again, too late! Service could definitely be improved.",

We ordered a ton of food and alcohol, and all of it was delicious, but the Big Bone Soup, Coconut Pork Belly, and the Double Down stand out in my mind.

I would have given this place a 4 star, but this last visit the entire restaraunts staff was so accommodating. We had originally thought we had a party of 8.... it grew to a party of 15. They were happy to move us. Service was quick. My water was always full. And the staff was very attentive. I think they have been working on this because my last few visits prior the staff didn't seem as attentive. Great job district one! Everything on the menu is delicious.

We ordered the lobster pho because we saw a couple of videos on Facebook about it... We knew we had to try it.

I've actually been here before didn't realize it until I walked the restaurant.  All and all, the outing to District One was a positive one. Staff was super friendly and attentive. We all had a lot of fun trying the different things. There were definitely foods we enjoyed, and then there were things that we were indifferent about.  Sashimi Tacos - I enjoyed them, but there's hardly any fish in them. Also hard to justify the price.  Oxtail Fries - AMAZING. That's it! If you are with a group, get this and share!  Lobster Pho - I am kind of on the fence about this one. Nothing wrong with it. The dish did taste good, but given the price, I felt a little underwhelmed by it. Don't get me wrong, I totally finished every last a bit of it, but my opinion... let's say it like this... If I had to choose the oxtail fries or lobster pho as an entree, I'd go with oxtail fries. I think this dish is a great experience, but I don't see myself getting the lobster pho again.  All and all. A very positive experience. Definitely would like to come back and try some of the other dishes. 4 out of 5 stars. Unique experience. Attentive staff. Mindblowing lobster pho would have propelled my rating to 5 stars. Oxtail fries is a must!",

Instead of letting us cancelling the order, they just went ahead and put in the order and told us the food was already in the making.  So we had to take it to go.   They were trying to make it up for us by giving us one of the dishes for free, guess what, instead of the happy hour price, they charged us full price, because by the time they put in the order into the system( an hour later) it was already 7:06pm(happy hour 4-7) So we ended up paying more....

So we took to Yelp and saw that this place was pretty well rated, and decided to give it a shot. After eating here, I'm sort of depressed. This was basically the best rare steak pho I've ever had, being on par with OB Noodle House in Ocean Beach, CA (which I think is the best). Pho is one of my favorite foods, and it really is a sad twist of fate that a bowl of pho this good is so far away from my hometown in Orange County.   For starters, the broth was absolutely delicious. There was a hint of anise that was just enough to recognize, but it was downplayed by the clove, which was the star in my book. The broth had a nice complexity to it, but at the same time, it was that simple, wholesome broth that you expect from a good bowl of pho.   The meat - wow. A good cut of ribeye that also happened to have a fair amount of marbling (I always get the meat on the side) for this type of food. It was perfect. The service was also very good, the staff were all nice. I definitely will be back here the next time I come to Vegas.",

I guess I am definitely in the minority here, but I thought the best thing about my visit was serendipitously meeting Eric and Lisa R and having them join us for dinner. Beyond that this place had mediocre food and terrible service. From the moment I walked through the door, it was nothing but waiting.  Waiting for a host/-ess or anyone to acknowledge us or tell us to put our name down, etc. After being seated and ordering, it was waiting for my ice tea which came after everyone else's drinks were served and only after prompting the waitress. Then waiting for everyone's entree. I ordered the bun bo hue and green papaya salad, which came out in that order.  The green papaya salad had large, steamed 20/25 shrimp, instead of the dehydrated small bay shrimp (which add additional saltiness to the dish). It was okay. The bun bo hue had a good, robust beef flavor and was not too spicy, but it was missing the pig hock and the pig's blood. When I asked if they forgot, the waitress replied they were out. Gee, you couldn't tell us that before we ordered?! You can't send someone across the street to 168 Market to  buy some? To add insult to injury, while waiting our waitress to refill my ice tea, I see a waiter carrying a pitcher of ice tea by, look at my empty glass, walk to his table to fill a glass of ice tea, and then walk away to set the pitcher down. Really dude?! I know we were not your table but I guess you would've died on the spot if you had filled, or even inquired about, another customer's ice tea.  At the end of the meal, after all the waiting, I could not leave this place fast enough.",

Upon entering, the hostess never greeted me, or even smiled at me.  I had to approach her. When she sat us she didn't know the difference between a booster seat versus a high chair.  (Admittedly, I didn't know the difference when I had my first job)   The waitress was definitely trying her best, but she made too many mistakes to just overlook. We ordered the steak on the side. She even confirmed with us that we wanted it separate from the bowl of Pho. It was in the soup.  We asked for an extra spoon 3 times before getting it. The coconut water we asked for took asking twice for it and nearly 10 minutes.   Then, the runner bringing the food out just held the food right in my sister-in-law's face rather than placing it on the table. On top of all that the rice was under cooked.  The beef carpaccio was less than lackluster.   I MIGHT be back.",

    "text": "I obviously don't \"get this place\" while I appreciate the decor the food leaves a ton to be desired.  Honestly I don't care if I am eating at a bus stop out of a paper hat if the food is good I will eat there every day.  This is literally the reason I hate trying new places.  When I arrived for a late lunch around 2pm the place was pretty busy. I later put two and two together and figured the only people drinking a bottle of Veuve on a Monday afternoon would be the owner and his friends.    I ordered the rib eye pho, I may not be an expert but I have had pho at more than 20 places in Las Vegas and LA including staples like Pho Kim Long.  The pho at District One tasted like they took beef jerky from Wal-Mart and soaked it in hot water then threw in some \"Fresh vegetables\" also from Wal-Mart with maybe a dash of MSG but certainly not enough to add any flavor.  It was the worst Pho I have ever had. Period. I am writing this review absolutely starving because I took two bites and realized that even the entire bottle of cheap Hoisen sauce couldn't improve the flavor.  When I told the server it wasn't good and I just wanted a box and the check (In hindsight I don't even know why i would bother taking it to go.) She didn't include any utensils or sauces so she must have imagined I would just throw it out. She did give a half hearted apology and offer something different however I was so disgusted with the food so far I couldn't picture anything else on the menu edible.  Here is the worst part of the entire experience, I believe the level of ineptitude transcends anything thing the \"chef\" could ruin in the back of the house. So I have already voiced my frustration with how awful the food is and I am actually offering to pay for it as opposed to just walking out and telling them where to stick it. I put my debit card in the $8 check and she promptly returns to inform me there is a $15 minimum on CC transactions. REALLY? Do I have cash? No... I don't have cash.  I will go ahead and lay out the reasons why this pisses me off so much.  1. $15 dollar minimum! Seriously?  This is illegal according to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill  (3) LIMITATION ON RESTRICTIONS ON SETTING TRANSACTION MINIMUMS OR MAXIMUMS.  (A) IN GENERAL.--A payment card network shall not, directly or through any agent, processor, or licensed member of the network, by contract, requirement, condition, penalty, or otherwise, inhibit the ability (i) of any person to set a minimum dollar value for the acceptance by that person of credit cards, to the extent that (I) such minimum dollar value does not differentiate between issuers or between payment card networks; and (II) such minimum dollar value does not exceed $10.00  2. This is stupid, what do you think their average transaction for lunch is? I'm going to go ahead and say their average check is just under $15. You are only going to piss people off with these kinds of restrictions. This may have flown 15 years ago but when the lady selling tamales out of her van started accepting credit cards on her iPhone it made this place look ridiculous. When McDonald's started allowing credit card payments, they found that the average purchase size increased from $4.50 to $7.00 (source: NPR). A broad study across multiple industries conducted by Dunn & Bradstreet found that purchase sizes were 12% to 18% more when paid for with credit card.  3. I am obviously already having a bad experience, why not just proactively handle the problem and when you drop off my check let me know \"for next time\"?  Would it really have been that hard for her do think autonomously without me needing to get more upset than I already was?  In conclusion: Don't go here. It isn't worth the hassle or frustration, maybe the owner should put down his noontime Champaign and get in the kitchen. I don't know what else can save this place from becoming yet another mediocre eatery in a city that deserves better.",

    "text": "Seeing that this place received 4/5 stars and 900+ reviews, I believed that this restaurant would live up to the hype. There were so many good reviews on the bone marrow and oxtail pho as well as many other dishes from the menu. However my experience here fell short. I usually don't write reviews but I thought I would share my experience.  First thing was when we walked in, there was a host stand but no host. There was a sign for patrons to sign in on a sheet with a name and number of guests. Our presence wasn't acknowledge until about 25 minutes later. Not sure if this is a Vegas thing because they're so busy (we had a similar experience at another restaurant) or that's how they operate.  Once we sat down we looked over the menu. Most of the dishes had unique twists on Vietnamese cuisine. But long story kind of short - we wanted to try the oxtail fries, they were out of fries. My friend and I wanted to try the bone marrow pho, they were out of bone marrow.  Since trying the bone marrow was out of the question I went with a basic meatball pho. After 30 minutes the dishes started to arrive to the table. This is also when one of the servers informed me that they were out of meatballs for the meatball pho.  Are you F'n serious!?!? I mean bad enough you made me wait 30 minutes to tell me this but  those meatballs  for pho ( and French fries) are usually frozen.  You would think.. running a restaurant that serves PHO you would make sure you have some of them suckers in the freezer at least.  Manager probably wasn't on top of inventory this week.  At this point I was getting really HANGRY. Everyone at the table had gotten their food and now I had to look at the menu and decide what to get (being if they didn't run out of it already) I decided to go with the oxtail fried rice remembering that there were rave reviews on the dish on Yelp. The dish came out about 15 minutes later and let me tell you... I thought you couldn't really mess up fried rice but.. this was pretty horrible. I don't know if they forgot to season it bc they were in a hurry to push it out since they didn't have any ingredients left in their kitchen for any other dish on that menu or what but.. it just tasted like i was eating steamed white rice with onions. Because there was a lot of white onions in it with maybe a bit or a shred of oxtail meat here and there.  I ended up having to season the rice with whatever condiments they had at the table, which wasn't much. I should have known- any Vietnamese restaurant that doesn't have fish sauce or soy sauce on the table as a condiment should be a warning sign.    I don't know..maybe we went at the wrong time or maybe that's just how they roll.. but I would not recommend this place to anyone- not even hipster foodies. This place is just overrated and over priced.",

    "text": "Came for dinner with the fiance. I've been meaning to try this place as we can always use some variety into our late night eats rotation.  The waitress brought over a chalkboard menu with specials and explained each one. We decided to get the oxtail fried rice off this menu. I thought this was pretty yummy fried rice as the rice was flavored well and there was plenty of chunks of oxtail in the rice. It had one egg on top, but it definitely needed more as after mixing it up into the rice, it sort've disappeared so perhaps consider getting a extra egg if you're a egg slut like me.  We also got the fried cornish hen with tomato rice. I rarely ever see cornish hen on menus, which is unfortunate as it's a more juicy,personal sized chicken. The fry on the bird was good, light crisp and it had a pleasant seasoning on it where I detected a hint of cinnamon that was lovely. If you love natural style fried chicken (no heavy kfc style breading) then this might be your jam. I was into this, it reminds me of Maxs Filipino style chicken that I grew up eating.   Our server was pretty good about checking in on us. I like that this place is clean, modern  and has a young atmosphere with upbeat dance music. It's refreshingly different from the minimal utilitarian nature of most Asian establishments. The food is good so the fun vibe is just icing. I will be back soon to try the pho!",

It seemed like it was dead a while ago. Not sure, if they have a live tank or where they sourced it, but expected it to be a live lobster for $49; especially since frozen lobster is less pricey. Overall it was okay. I would not order it again if I come back. I was told the Big Bone soup was good, so maybe that next time (if I do come back)  Ox tail fried rice:  I liked the flavor in this but it seemed like beef fried rice. Was expecting actual oxtails but they cut it up, which is cool when you're eating fried rice. I think if they put in actual ox tail, it would have tasted more like ox tail.   Garlic noodles:  This was okay. I was told they served it with lobster. If I had known, I would have ordered this with lobster.",

Lets be real the food alone is really delicious as long as you order the right choice for you . This is Vietnamese fusion which means they have a lot of the flavor but more Americanized vibe when it comes to how it's run and the food is a fused sooo I was able to eat and get good service plus feel like the quality of the food and dishes Just Had more upscale vibe ... but it also still kept to its roots and was Vietnamese to me ..   I guess they are famous for two things which get talked about in other reviews but we didn't try those so I will just breakdown the stuff I got ..  Shrimp pho-11.99 I think which many feel is a lot for pho but compared to a lot of our pho places I've been to this price isn't bad for the size and for the fact that I have a server with a smile lol  Oysters - I got 6 they were decent   Wings on happy hour - they were dry but I think my server felt I didn't want any sauceso that is why I didn't get ones like in the picture but they were tasty flavor   Shaken beef salad - so so good like melt in your mouth meat and good dressing   I can't wait to come back and try more stuff especially dessert but over all this is a nice spot to get booze and food   We got the Gin drink to try that I can't remember it's name but it was tasty too",

They have oxtail pho, oxtail fries, they have lobster, huge bone marrow soup, garlic noodles, whole fried fish, braised ribs, beef carpaccio and so manyyyy other totally amazing food! The place is very hip and has lots of tvs around so you can watch sports while sitting at the bar or even at the table. I haven't been here for a while so I placed a take out order after work one day. My food was ready in 15 min. When I got there I wanted to add some garlic noodles with oxtail. Well, no problem, they put my order in and it literally was ready in 5 min. The staff is super nice, helpful and attentive!",

Although pho is ubiquitous as a quick, affordable, and tasty meal for any time of the day, here one can find pairings not only with finer cuts off sliced beef, but also with terrific Maine lobster. Many pho broths rely on MSG to improve flavor, but the District One broth is goodness in a bowl. No thirstiness afterwards. Only a deeply flavor broth achieved by a very long stew. Don't miss this place!",

Who would have thought, substituting oxtail for your traditional beef, chicken, or Chinese sausage would be so amazing. The oxtail just gives it that added richness and flavor that you're accustomed to with oxtail. My only knock was the dish was a bit greasy and salty, otherwise very tasty. Although, I didn't try their Pho it seems like it's very popular here with large slabs of beef bones swimming in the bowls. The night we visited there were a quite a bit of families with their kids. Unusual for a bar like atmosphere, but maybe a lot of it had to do with the holidays, and table settings to accommodate large parties.",

This place has outdone themselves with exceptional service since they tended to our table as often as any table should. It's difficult to have good dining experiences with big parties, since servers can possibly get overwhelmed. A few of us were there more for the company and weren't hungry, including me, but everything I tried that night was flavorful. Calamari is my son's favorite and the calamari here is a bit on the spicy side, but still so good. The pork belly was wow, phenomenal. The oxtail pho is something I MUST order, not just try, on my next visit.   I love the setup of this restaurant...spacious, cool, and did I mention they have a bar? Yes. Something about this place gives a good ambiance.",

    "text": "I remember the days when I used to get excited about going out for Kobe Pho. It sounded so extravagant. And the local place that served Kobe pho wasn't even using Kobe but people were still getting excited over it.  Move over pseudo-Kobe, Now, I have a new love, LOBSTER PHO.   Ok I know it sounds excessive, but I came here to Vegas to have an entire lobster in my pho. No regrets. Was it delicious? Yes. Was it expensive? The market price was around $49 for a 1.5 lb lobster so it was worth it.   First of all, I pictured myself breaking apart a lobster in a bowl of pho. So I brought handi wipes picturing the worst case hand messiness scenario. This was not the case. The lobster was already extracted and placed on the shell of the lobster. Every last bit of meat was extracted, I was pleased to find whole claws while digging through my pho. The broth needed no add ons, and was pretty solid. I drank the whole thing and even that the bowl was HUGE this was a lot of broth consumption.   While the Lobster Pho is a major attraction and so instagrammable and photogenic, there are a lot of sleeper hits on the menu that might not get the attention they deserve, including:  -The oysters in house special style. We got blue point oysters since they ran out of the other oysters and with ponzu, tobiko and topped with a serrano pepper they were outstanding. I'm not sure how I can go back to oysters with just cocktail sauce and lemon.  -The crispy egg rolls with pork and taro were a great appetizer selection. Crispy overload. The pork was tender and the taro was a surprise ingredient.  I wasn't too impressed by the green papaya salad. Given the choices, I would have gone with the Shaken Beef Salad.   I am intrigued by the Big Bone Soup and Pho Oxtail they have here. If I ever plan another trip to Vegas, I'll be hitting up this spot again.",

Lots of very helpful and good looking staff to help serve. Everything was done quickly and efficiently. They got us seated and answered all questions about the menu pretty quickly.  We tried the spicy noodles, pork belly bun, and steak rolls. All were good dishes, nothing that blew our minds out, but flavors were well developed. The spicy noodles could have used more meat and more spice. It definitely was a good take on a very traditional vietnamese dish. The fried pork belly buns was a cool take on the traditional bun. I mean... \"anything fried makes it better' right?! I liked that extra crunch to contrast the tender pork belly. Finally the steak roll was subpar for me. I had one and it was plenty to see that it was just a filler, not so much a homerun dish.  Will definitely be back next time to try more dishes. There is plenty of parking, and the bathroom was very clean and modern. All around great experience. Happy eating!",

I'm not sure it was a long night of drinking and that I was super hungry. But everything we ordered were so damn perfect.   Surf'n'Turf Pho: 1/2 lobster with Ribeyes steaks slices. $35. Not only the toppings tasted fresh and perfectly cooked/prepared, the broth was very tasty. It was full of flavor and very aromatic. It was so good that I did not need to add any sauce in my soup because it was perfect \" just the way you are\". I'm drooling while writing this review.  We ordered the grilled squid and ox tail Fries (not in picture) as well. They were good but I was too full after finishing my pho. Yeah the appetizers came after the pho. But it's all good. I'm glad I saved my tummy for the delicious pho. Yummmm! I drank all the soup, technically cleaned my bowl ! no shame!   Oh and they have Hennessy on Tap! Right? How awesome is that? I don't see this too often. So yes... while in Vegas, Why Not!   I will make it as an tradition to visit this place every time I visit Vegas now. Highly recommended!",

We came on a Friday around 6 pm with 6 people and were able to easily get a table. Throughout our entire meal the servers were super helpful and friendly.  To start the meal we took advantage of their happy hour specials and went with some house oysters, belly buns, and crispy egg rolls. We also had to add in some drinks of course too so we shared the asahi pitcher of beer and a sake flight. Hands down my favorite part of the entire meal was the house oysters. They were super fresh and came topped with a ponzu sauce and jalapeno. I honestly could have eaten just a dozen of these by myself. As for the belly buns and egg rolls they were just alright to me. I felt they could have been a bit more flavorful, but overall still good. Next for entrees I went with the garlic noodles and fish tacos. The noodles were good, but a little bit bland. I added some hot sauce to give it a little extra kick. The fish tacos though, amazing! They're a bit on the smaller side, but the perfect size with a side of noodles.  I'm so glad we came here and I can't wait to get back and go ham on some house oysters!",

Get the lobster pho! Everything is very shareable so we ordered the Serrano chicken wings, two orders of bao buns (I won't share those... Way too yummy), spicy edamame and whole squid. The flavors and textures were on point. For the amount of food we ate, the price was very fair. We will definitely be back!",

Jason is an absolute delight and always very friendly. There are a few of the waitresses I've met and thus far they've all been very nice as well. I have only ever had a long wait for food ONCE and that was in my party of 8 (my college graduation night a few weeks ago) for about 5 different appetizers. Ordered a second round and that came within five minutes! Crazy fast, can't complain! Glen is a great chef! Matcha green tea drink is sooo good and my aunty really loves the coconut drink. I always order the Veggie Pho for my meal and it always comes quickly and DELICIOUS! Five stars.",

Very flavorful and lobster was cooked perfectly.  The beef carpaccio is really good. Has a little smokey flavor to it.  The egg rolls and spring rolls are ok. Nothing special.  Now for the bone marrow pho. It's massive and a ton of work. Ask for gloves to dig out all that marrow and make sure you order a side of noodles because it doesn't come with it. DELICIOUS!",

My whole family basically ordered the ox tail, because we have so much seafood dinner plans for SOCAL. So we had ordered a little way too much for our first meal.  Their papaya salad was so bland, I did not enjoy it at all. The looks on yelp was too deceiving.  The chicken wings were ok, not bad but not the best. Their ox tail fries were so salty. And the fries were so soggy.  Their oxtail pho, was also very salty. And their ox tail was huge. I ended up eating only one.   I Won't say this place is perfect for Asian people. I think their taste cater to American style taste so much more.",

My mom likes their veggie pho but always says she wishes that it had more asian veggies in it. We all liked the pork belly buns and fried chicken wings that you'll find on the happy hour menu. I had the pho tai. It was just what I needed.  Service was awesome.  We ordered a few drinks, a sake bomb and a donkey...one of an asian variety seeing as though it came with some lychee in it. Yum!!! I love FRESH lychee!! We spent about $100 for dinner, for the 3 of us. We tried so many things and made a night of it, really. Goodness, I cannot tell you how wonderful the service was.  The probably 8 or so different servers that came to check on us were so fantastic. We never had to search for them. They anticipated some of our needs. They watched to see if my lil one needed anything, aside from a change of clothes because she wanted to swim in the big bone soup broth because it was so good. LOL. This was definitely a unique dining experience, drinking a donkey, slurping out bone marrow, and waving our hands around because the wings were so hot. It was a fun time. And again, service was impeccable! The happy hour menu is a great deal. I hope more people will come in for happy hour. I'm sure you won't leave UNhappy!  items we ordered drink: sake bomb drink: Vietnamese donkey (I think was the name of it) pork belly buns spicy fried chicken veggie pho ox tail big bone soup w rice  pho tai 1/2 dozen oysters egg rolls",

It's sweet like eating sugar at first, then very salty, and my tongue was numb after a few spoons of rice. Undoubtedly there must be an extremely good amount of MSG in the food here.

Great scene  Veggie pho- delicious for being all veggies House oysters- during dinner- Super pricey and not very tasty- btw the 3 of us we ordered 12 and there was a HAIR in one of the oysters which threw our appetite out of the way for the oysters so we didnt even eat them Shaken beef salad- delicious deep fried beef- very flavorful and DEF recommend  Notifications stout- Deep and chocolately Shrimp Bloody Mary- see attached pics- so much stuff inside but not very strong  LOBSTER PHO or lobster fried rice is supposedly the thing to try here: didnt try in- because it is 45$ per order for approximately a 1.5lb lobster  Happy hour: see attached pics- drinks and food (Friday Afternoon) DEF NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HAPPY HOUR- the food was terrible and not I understand why this place wasnt more busy for happy hour especially with such a nice venue and space. But after eating, my hubby and I both said this place probably had the worst happy hour ever. We actually left feeling unhappy.  - kronenboug blanc-witbeir: Great beer- Def recommended - Dogfish Head - Seaquencg Ale- Sour sour sour beer, not for all -Oysters 1.00 a piece- THEY LOOKED SUPER SUPER OLD and dried out. I returned my first order of 6, just to have them bring me a set of oysters (which looked like the ones i just sent back) that were old and dried out and stuck to the shell because they looked like they had been previously shucked and just sitting in the fridge- They also tasted old (not juicy, not salty with the brine from the inside of the shell)- Worst worst oysters I have ever ordered and I cant believe i didnt get sick after trying one  - Serrano fried chicken wings: regular deep fried wings- no flavor at all. When they say serrano fried chicken, I was expecting a sauce that would make the wings more flavorful. But the serrano chiles looked like they were fried in oil with garlic and then just pour with oil over the wings- DEF NOT RECOMMENDED- order came with 6 and my husband and I couldnt even finish the order- and we love chicken wings - deep fried and regular pork buns: DEF recommended and you can get one of each since the order comes with 2 buns  Overall: happy hour was super disappointing but the dinner menu is more promising 4 stars for dinner menu and 1 star for happy hour  Not sure if ill be back except for the veggie pho",

Service was superb, after seated our hostess let us know that our waiter would be around soon. After having some time to look over the menu, our waiter arrived and told us about the daily specials and asked if we had any questions about the menu. Very attentive and informative.   I wanted to try a bit of everything so I ordered: The Five spice hen over tomato rice and pickled, Vietnamese beef carpaccio, Oxtail Pho, Pork belly buns, and the Oxtail Fries. Five spice hen over tomato rice: first off, I'm a sucker for five spice. Then hen was juicy on the inside with a fried crispy other skin. Vietnamese beef carpaccio was different but full of flavor. It was a little heavy on the sauce for my taste on carpaccio but hey its fusion. Perk belly buns, were delicious and juicy. Full of flavor with a soft steamed bun. Oxtail pho, had to try this. Oxtail, in pho? crazy! but they nailed it. I will honestly say, cleanest pho in town. What I mean by clean is, you don't get that heavy feeling of salt ans msg. Just a really good broth with chunks of soft oxtail finger picking goodness. If you have room spring for the oxtail fries. Its topped with a fried egg and oxtail infused gravy. So good.",

I appreciate the decor, cleanliness, service, and of course, the food. Despite the ambience which would be appealing to a younger generation, my parents really enjoy coming here. I've held business meetings here as well.   Their menu is absolutely solid, and I've been having fun working my way through the list. It's not just fusion for the sake of being fusion -- there are traditional items working in the freshest ingredients. And they make of the best pho in town (and the Mekong River Noodle Soup is also great, harking to the California Tung Kee noodle house combination bowl... I know some of you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about....).  And their creme brulee and coconut ice cream is worth cramming into your full stomach.",

Seriously the stuff on the menu are pretty wild.  Example: oxtail fries, oxtail fried rice, oxtail pho, lobster pho (with the actual 2-3 lb of lobster, not the ones they chop up and mix it in the bowel).  My friends and I shared the oxtail fries and I thought it was okay (Note that I don't really eat fried food so if it's okay for me, it's probably bomb for some of you). My man and I shared the oxtail pho with extra oxtail and extra noodle and that was amazing. Omg. If it wasn't so expensive we would of ordered another one (I think about $17.99 plus tax).  This is good food and it's definitely on the pricier side but you get what you pay for.",

Their menu looked very interesting which was what drew us in but i guess some of the food is seasonal or they change their menu often cuz some of what we saw on yelp was not available at this time . Some of the dishes were a hit or miss. First the good - Oxtail fried rice, crispy red snapper were excellent and a must order.  The bad - the papya salad tasted like it was marinated with soy sauce instead of fish sauce, the chicken wings w/ garlic was a lil bland, the grilled whole squid i guess was okay but needed a lil more flavor or more of a char from grilling but did look very appetizing.  The varieties of pho were cool and was enough to satisfy my hunger.",

The restaurant is new and has a great, hip vibe. The decor is American and is geared towards a younger crowd. We were seated and ordered some drinks. Looking through the menu, we ordered Oxtail Fries, Shrimp Spring Rolls, and the Ribeye Pho. Pho Kim Long used to be my main spot but this new place blew them away. The portions are bigger and the food has intense flavor. You know how you go to a restaurant and wash your hands, then you have to touch the dirty doorknobs to get out? Well, this spot has the sinks OUTSIDE of the bathroom so that you can wash your hands and keep them clean. All around, this place has the perfect vibe, great, friendly staff, amazing food, and the right set up. They close at 3 am so you have plenty of time to get there after a night out. So, try it with your friends. You won't be disappointed. Promise.",

They also have a decent late night happy hour, the only issue I have with the place is the parking lot! It's in a plaza with a bunch of other asian business....which means lots of asian people. In cars. Trying to park.......so, just be careful in the parking lot, and if you make it to district one won't be let down!",

Note: I'm a very petite, 5'3\" Asian girl at 82 lbs so maybe that's why it seemed like a lot of food to me, but still, everything was yum.  I finished everything but the rice.  It really hit the spot for someone who had just hopped out of a 5hr car ride.  Atmosphere was going for a trendy, Asian hangout prime of Instagram photos despite being a bit dark.  My dad had their tea and said it was good.  Also, they brew/drain your Vietnamese coffee right in front of you the traditional way so they gained brownie points there too.  Staff was very friendly.  Just noticed that even though it was an Asian eatery, they had posted a white, blonde chick to greet everyone while the actual Asian staff was standing way in the back.  That didn't sit right with my parents since they came to this Vietnamese restaurant expecting to be greeted by fellow Vietnamese people.",

I got the lobster pho, which had an entire lobster in it and the broth was unique but in a great way. It was $45 dollars, but totally worth it to try once.. though I'm not sure I would get it again, just because of the price. My boyfriend got the oxtail fried rice, which was very reasonably priced and also amazing. I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas, I need to try ALL of the other dishes on the menu and all the drinks look delish!",

We were seated right away but it took a while for our party to order because it was our first time. We ended up ordering pork belly sliders as appetizer, ox tail pho, beef pho, spicy noodle and like a bbq combo with rice. The broth of our soup was average. It did not have a depth of flavor. The bbq was good, but it was not something special.",

Obviously, this joint isn't your standard Vietnamese Pho joint. It's wide open, the servers speak English, and it doesn't that scuzzy feel that we all love about Pho joints. Service was very good, and it even has this sports bar area with lots of TVs tuned into your favorite sporting event or sports show. I'm not sure how I feel about watching College Football over Pho, but I'm willing to give it a try!  There are way too many good looking items to not come back again, so I will!",

Last time I ate snails was when I was a lot younger and these were huge compared to the kind I used to eat lol, they were great.  For entrees, my table got the fish tacos, coconut pork belly, and oxtail fried rice. All were amazing! Oxtail fried rice is definitely good for sharing. We were all stuffed and had to take some to go, but still made room for dessert of course haha. Pandan creme brulee and coconut ice cream were just as amazing. Jason was our awesome server, thank you Jason!  They also have one of my favorite beers, Kronenbourg Blanc 1664! My fiance (quickly) enjoyed his Matcha cocktail, as did I with the Tropical Blue   Long story short, everything was amazing. We will all be back for sure, and I most definitely recommend this place!",

I came here with my boyfriend a little before noon way before the crowd even started to come in. We had ordered the pho nam, braised pork belly and egg rolls. The pho nam wasn't as great as expected. When coming to a vietnamese restaurant, you'd think the flavor would have some tradition in there and not a bland flavor. It seemed as though the broth was altered and not as delicious as you'd expect. As I waited for my dish to arrive, the braised pork, we started to notice that the other customers who came way after we ordered started to get their dish before mine. We asked the waiter/waitress where my order was as it had already been ten minutes after the pho came out. They said there was a back order in the kitchen. How the heck is there a back order when no one was there yet when we ordered?! great cover up...but not really because we told them there was no one here when we ordered and they just looked stumped......... by the time it finally did arrive which was 20 minutes later.... the food looked like it had been sitting under the warmer the whole time and so did the taste of it.   For a place that received so many great reviews, highly disappointed. Rather go to their parent company Pho So 1 which actually makes great food and has the food come out in time instead of making up excuses. The Only Reason they are getting two stars is because they decided to give us 15% off our meal. So for that they get an extra star.",

They didn't bring us enough menus. The first time we came in, the server brought over the specials board and suggested different items since we had never been there before. This time, we had to ask about the specials and he didn't even bring the board, he mentioned the few that he could remember. We saw all the other servers bringing the specials board to the tables. Our share plates WERE NOT WASHED! They had food remnants from the last guests. When they brought \"new\" ones, they were also dirty! We asked for everything to be brought out as it was ready. We placed our order at 6:40, by 7:25 we had not received the appetizers or my sister's meal. We had to ask the manager and then the server about the missing items. When the pork buns finally came out, one at a time, and they were hard and inedible. By that time, everyone had completed their meal and my sister was not interested in her meal. I asked the manager to remove the buns, she apologize and said she would, but the check was presented with the buns. At that point, the server, Johnny L, was scared, and stopped coming to the table. He wasn't attentive anyways. We had other servers stop by the table more times than he did. The \"manager\", Vy, was too busy talking it up with her friends, to assist us. We were so impressed the first time and brought our family back to try it. Had high hopes in becoming regulars at this place. That's definite no.",

Like the academic so intelligent she can make physics relatable, the kitchen here has spent the time necessary to master the wonderful art of your grandmother's cooking and then present it in an approachable way.

    "text": "I just had the worst experience here. It started with a cluster of a mess waiting for a table since there was no hostess or waitlist. We saw another aggravated couple seat themselves at the bar so we did the same. We ordered egg rolls, chicken pho, and rice combo. Simple enough right? No lobster this, no oxtail that.   Am I suppose to ask for my side garnishes when ordering pho? Accept my apology if it's suppose to be ordered a la carte. My pho came out first and sat there as I tried to flag down any staff member. Fifteen minutes later, my boyfriend's rice combo comes out so we asked the food runner for the garnishes for my pho and fish sauce for his rice. By the time that came out, she brought along the eggrolls. I'm not even upset about the sequence of the food but damn, 2 of 4 of my eggrolls were soggy because it was placed under all the wet greens. I asked for our check since we seem to be adding on to the masses that were stressing out the staff. I am in the restaurant industry so I totally understand, but for such a beautiful business opportunity... staff up, get more organized, and be consistent. Smile even if you're stressed from all the big tops, I lived in Vegas prior and learned to treat the tourists kindly. This might be their first and only time out here so make their experience amazing.   I couldn't eat anymore because I was just so upset with the experience. I was really hoping for a good last lunch before my flight. This just ruined it for me.",

    "text": "Went there last night; very convenient hours for those of us working late on the strip.  Setting was very clean, modern, and a good hang out spot. Overall, the pho was the highlight and very delicious but other items weren't as flavorful and just missed the mark a little bit.  Here's a break down:  Fish taco: just ok, kind of fishy but it was a good concept.  Needed a flavorful relish or something else.  Spring rolls: crunchy and the garnish (perilla leaf, lettuce, mint) was amazingly fresh and abundant. (I hate it when they only give you one perilla leaf or mint).  But the radish and carrot chips could've been marinated longer.  Manila clams: good and full of clammy goodness but again, not super flavorful.  Lacked salt and maybe more herbs.  Cornish game hens: well cooked, sauce was good, tomato rice could've had more flavorful.  Ribeye and flank pho: we got this just to see how their standard pho was and it was deeeelicious.  Beefy broth with a hint of sweetness.  As with everything else the garnishes were super fresh.  Tender meat, and a lot of it.  It definitely makes me want to try more of their pho.  Service:  I don't care about service that much especially because service at a lot of Asian spots on spring mountain is almost non-existent but this place was just odd.  Our wait staff were all young and very nice, but you could tell they lacked experience.  They sort of seemed to want to talk to each other and hang out with their friends who were sitting at another table.  One time we wanted another beer and tried to make eye contact with one of them and he just looked at us and waved awkwardly and turned around and sat down so he can talk to his friends some more...was hilarious and very weird.   And then 3 of them cleared our table but none of them offered to get us our check.  It's like if I opened a restaurant and hired my little brother and let him hire all his friends.   But all in all I love that we have a new late night pho place!",

We walked in late Saturday night and surprisingly it wasn't crowded at all. We opted for the bar and got started right away. Our bartender Janell was off the chain. She got us a round of shots right away followed by drinks. Cheers to Janell!!!   For food, my husband and I ordered the Oxtail Fried Rice, Oxtail Pho, and Lemongrass Beef. Everything was really good. The broth of the pho was very flavorful. The fried rice was sooooooo comforting and the lemongrass beef was perfect with the rice. Comfort food at its finest!   I also had a taste of the Beef Carpaccio and OMG!!! That beef carpaccio is FIIIIIIIRE!!!!!!! If you're not scared of red meat, you HAVE TO order this dish. Its fucking AMAZING! Excuse my language but damnnnn!!! Its so good!   So yeah, great local spot with great food and drinks. We're definitely coming back and trying more of their menu.",

Here's a rundown of what was ordered during my last visit.  Crispy Bird's Nest Noodle: Reminds me of Hong Kong-style noodles. The nest-shaped bowl of noodles held a delicious mix of veggies, meat and seafood. Stir it up and you get a tasty, crispy plate of deliciousness.  Spicy Pork String Beans: Get this. It's amazing. I don't know how else to describe this.   Baby Bok Choi: Light, wok fried dish with a subtle garlic flavor. If you like baby bok choi, this could be your jam.  Fried Whole Fish: DELICIOUS. The sweet and sour glaze gives off a strong aroma but the flavors aren't heavy to the palate. The fish we ordered was a red snapper. There are smaller and larger sizes; the small can feed about 2 to 3 people. Watch out for those fish bones.  Double Down: Meat lovers, rejoice in this short rib + Chinese sausage + fried egg on rice. So, so good!",

    "text": "BIG BONE SOUP! That's all you need to remember about this place. Yeah, they have other Asian fusion/Vietnamese style dishes, but the BBS is the star of the show. The soup itself is $18. If you want noodles it's an extra  $5 served in a separate bowl and $3 for rice. It took me a good 45 minutes to eat the soup. The bones have so much meat, tendons, and marrow that it takes time to work through each piece of bone. I was filled with joy as I was cutting off pieces of meat and mixing it up with the noodles. The marrow is flavorful and there is a lot of it. You could easily order 2 bowls of noodles and split the big bone.   We did order some appetizers. Belly buns and  spring rolls. Buns were tasty. I would order again. The spring rolls were good but I have had better.   It was kind of weird how they brought out our food. There was a large party of about 20 people and about a half full restaurant, so our orders were coming out sporadically. They brought my wife's dish out and the noodles for my soup before the appetizers. Then the belly buns came out, but no soup for me. Finally, the soup showed up and my wife was pretty much done with her dish. Then a few minutes later the spring rolls showed up. I took away a star for the kitchen service. The server, Blanca was nice and she apologized for the service. I understand. It was a little inconvenient but the BBS made up for it.   Drinks were good. The Hennessey Cafe Sua Da was excellent. Slow dripped Vietnamese coffee with Hennessey over ice for $15. Well worth it. Plus it gave me a nice pick me up after a long day in the sun.   I did appreciate Blanca and her kindness during our visit. She was excellent at her job and made us feel welcome.   Great place to visit if you're looking at getting away from the strip. With tip we paid just over $100. There are also some kareoke spots in the shopping center and near the Chubby Cattle if you are looking for Korean bbq. We took a Lyft frim the Orleans and it was a 5 minute drive. Give them a try and take on the Big bone soup. Happy eating!",

Had a party of three and ordered the following:  Ribeye Pho has a very flavorful broth with plenty slices of meat to complement the noodles. I personally did not try the whole dish but per coworker it was phenomenal.  I ordered the papaya salad. I wasn't a fan of it as the shrimp had an odd taste that almost seemed like it was over frozen. Would not recommend.   Also got the ribeye fries - at first glance it wasn't all that impressive but the taste was very savory.   Another appetizer we got was the Vietnamese carpaccio. Flavorful but had too much greasy underneath the meat for what I was expecting.  I previously came here and ordered the oxtail fried rice which is excellent. Portion size was decent, but price not so much.   Overall experience was decent and food is above average. But prices are a bit over. Would maybe consider coming back again.",

My friend had heard about their lobster pho from the food network, but when we got there, the prices scared us into sharing a dish of black pepper lobster which was served at \"market price\".  The location was located in a busy plaza that was difficult to find parking. The service was decent and the servers were friendly and attentive. Overall this would be a place I would take a date due to the cozy atmosphere.    Service: 4/5 (2 Glasses filled) I was thirsty, and after the second glass, the server gave up. However, servers were very friendly.  Food Quality: 3/5 The black pepper lobster was good, but seemingly just tasted like lobster with well made ramen.  It wasn't made for two people, and we shared, but the flavor was ordinary.  Value: 3/5  The value point was alright.  The atmosphere was dark and trendy. The price was a little on the high side, but if you want to try a place that's been on TV, then you should definitely try it.",

So of course the big question here is, does the hype live up to what everyone says it is?! Well, let me start off by stating that I didn't get their most ordered item which is the Lobster Pho or Bone Marrow Pho or even the Ox Tail Pho (it's too HOT outside for Pho, right now) with that said I will be back to try those items when it gets cold outside...  My hubby, homegirl and I arrived on a Sunday morning at around 11:15ish and there was no wait- we were seated right away. Jennifer was our server, who provided the perfect amount of customer service! She provided great recommendations all of which we practically ordered:   1) Garlic Serrano Chicken Wings: 5 Stars. Great crunch and a spicy flavor kick. I loved the slices of serranos sprinkled atop the wings.   2) Ox Tail Fried Rice: 5 Stars. I can eat this all day! The rice is cooked perfectly, there are tons of pieces of beef ox Tail; add sriracha, and this dish is bomb! Great portion size, we shared this between 3 hungry people. *wink   3) Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio: I love me some raw meat, of course the best I've ever had was in France- but who's asking. Lol. This particular Carpaccio wasn't that great. I would give it a hard 3 Stars, that's it. Idk what it is but the sauces on the meat seemed to have cooked it a bit so it wasn't as raw as I prefer. I love me some truffle oil, but it gave a weird taste. Would I order this again? Probably not. It's not a True Carpaccio dish, in my opinion -also for the price it's not worth it.  All in all, District One offers delicious food in a cool-hipster ambiance environment. I would totally come back to try the Pho!",

    "text": "District One is one of my favorite Modernized Vietnamese-American restaurants in Vegas. I've been here probably three times already and their service and food are usually great.   The Oxtail Fried Rice is one of their popular items for sure, at least to me because I always find myself ordering it everytime I'm there. The portion is huge so I can never finish it and very well flavored. The fried sunny side up egg on top is magical when you take your fork or spoon and split it down the middle. Let it slowly ooze down covering the mostly the entire rice dish, wowwww!  My mouth is salivating just writing about it. Anyways, please if it's the only menu item you can afford there, get that Oxtail Fried Rice! The only down side is I wish there was more meat. Lol   Another highlight is their Vietnamese shredded chicken salad. It's very good. The dressing is not too sweet, but not too sour either. Reminds me of how my mom would make it at home. A lot of chicken, shredded cabbage, and topped with crushed peanuts alongside fried rice chips. You eat it by scooping some of the salad mix onto the chips and it's as easy as that.   Additionally, the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio was great as well. If you can eat rare beef seasoned with citrus soy, truffle oil and sesame oil then order this! You won't regret it!   One last recommendation was the Grilled Squid! Oh man! That was delicious! Perfectly grilled and flavored. Came out sliced in portions easy to eat with a spicy creamy sauce to dip it in. Frankly, I liked it by itself without the dipping sauce.   Other than those three, I've tried their Oysters, Snails, Yellow-Tail Fish Tacos, and Green Papaya Salad and they were all mediocre. Nothing very special or memorable. The oysters were okay, I've had better and the Snails as well. One thing about it was the lemongrass they cooked the snails in because it made sipping the broth delicious - very flavorful! The Thai salad was too spicy and sour for my taste. The tacos were alright and I didn't feel like it was worth $11 for three. Too many veggies and salad, not enough of the yellow-tail. So overall, I would definitely recommend those above and hope to come back and try their pho next time!",

I will go back but D1 is just not near the top of my list for viet-casual cuisine.",

The oysters either come with horseradish or the house special sauce for $2 more, we opted for the house special. The ponzu sauce which is included in the house special gave a nice alternative to lemon juice by giving it some acidity. The spicy hue noodles was on the spicier side than what we are normally used to getting at other vietnamese restaurants. The heat was definitely tolerable and was very tasty. The pho tai nam was also very good. The broth felt clean with not much MSG, but was still flavorful. The meat in the pho was very tender as well.  Service was also good, it wasn't too busy so our waiter was able to fill our water multiple times without asking.",

    "text": "This is an easy go-to place if you have friends in town! It's a hip Viet fusion restaurant, and has a modern take on some authentic dishes. Some of the dishes are a little bland for my taste, but I understand that the \"usual\" fishier foods are diluted so that it's more appealing to a wider audience.  Here are some of the plates I've had: Spring rolls (3/5) It has pork, shrimp, and a fried wonton wrapper(?) in the middle to give it that extra crunch. If you've ever had Brodard, I felt like they were trying to meld that into this spring roll. It wasn't bad, but I personally don't care for pork and shrimp spring rolls very much so take that into account.  Viet Beef Carpaccio (4/5) It came out warm, which is not what I expected. However, the flavors were pretty rich - probably due to the truffle oil, and I would definitely order this again.   Serrano Wings (3.5/5) I really want to love these wings, they have a nice crunch and flavor. It's lacking in contrast or texture...I'm not sure what it needs but maybe an extra saucy marinade. They did give us a sweet fish sauce when we asked, and that made it taste even better! I think this could be a 5/5 if that option was already there.   Yellowtail tacos (4/5) These remind me of the mini tacos at Catch. It's a flaky, light shell with yellowtail and you squeeze some lime on top. It's not OMG AMAZING, but I would easily add this as an appetizer.  Sea Snails (2/5) I personally did not like these sea snails. They are larger than I'm accustomed to, so its pretty chewy. The lemon grass sauce that it comes in is extremely light so it doesn't coat the meaty parts well, so I'm not a fan.  Double Down (3.5/5) It comes with chinese sausage, a sunny side egg over white rice, and we chose pork chop instead of short rib. The dish itself doesn't really call for anything spectacular, so I would say it's okay. If I was having one of those homesick days, and wanted something simple, I would order this. OR you could just go some place else and order com tam/broken rice.  Bird's Nest (3/5) I'm underwhelmed by this dish. The egg noodles weren't as thick so when it's fried, you don't get the same hard crunch. That's just a preference I have, and again I'm a viet food snob so this isn't saying that the dish itself is bad...I just don't like the way it's done here. I will say that it doesn't taste as greasy as the less high end viet restaurants.  Lobster Pho (4/5) I haven't tried the other pho options they have here, and they have a lot! We chose the lobster pho because we've never had a lobster pho, plus its so instagram-able. I'm not sure what the broth base is, we didn't ask. But it didn't have the same aroma as the earthy beef broths my palette is used to. After adding the hoison sauce, siracha, and the other herbs, the broth was to our liking. There was surprisingly A LOT of lobster meat, I'm very pleased with that as we had to force ourselves to eat all the lobster so it didn't go to waste.  Ox Tail Fried Rice (5/5) Out of all the dishes I've had so far, I like this the most.I don't have the fancy vocab to describe the flavor, but its not bland haha. Definitely order this if it's your first time here.  It's a good restaurant overall, has a decent selection for happy hour, and also a viable option if you have a larger party - I've seen multiple birthday dinners of 12+ people.",

We also had the oxtail pho which is solid but a bit pricey at $16, where we can get a similar bowl for less than $10 In San Jose, CA.  Cocktails were good.  Overall for quality this is a strong bet, and if it were on the Strip then the prices would be fine, but it's a little high for Chinatown.",

Goi Ga Chicken Salad - The cabbage was grated more fine on this version.  I prefer the regular goi ga where the cabbage is a little thicker.  A thicker cut cabbage is better for mixing the ingredients together,. 4. Steak and Eggs - Just terrible.  The meat was very gamey and the sauce had raw pieces of garlic which needed to be cooked more. Rice was dry. 5. Crispy Bird's Nest Noodle - Bland.  Lots of vegetables which was a plus.",

All the things we ordered were off the menu specials minus The Big Bone Soup but this is what we ordered:  Lobster Fried Rice - Huge chunks of lobster with claws and shell as decorative display. Flavor was ok and not the best fried rice or lobster I had especially for the price but the the presentation was done well.  The Big Bone Soup - Shit looks like something a caveman would eat. Not the most flavorful and some may find this shit intimidating with this pre-historic looking ass dish. We kept the bones for the lil homies back home.   Loco Moco - Yah we ordered this, so fuckin what hahaha. It was okay and not the best loco moco we have had. We honestly wasn't expecting much.   Overall this place is really cool and the vibe is chill. The one issue I have is the smell of this place. I don't know if it's because of the cooking but the smell fuckin hits you like Ranch 99.

    "text": "This place is for the Gram. Much like the Ice Cream Museum, don't do it! We were lured in here by Insider's marketing video of their Lobster Pho. The video made it look so good that we had to try it when we came down to Vegas. Little did we know, their Market Price for a 1.5 pound lobster would be $55.  Okay, no fault of their own since we didn't do our due diligence and called ahead of time and ask for the price. They had other \"Gram\" worthy Phos from Oxtail Pho to Bone Marrow Pho.  I saw some other people order the Bone Marrow Pho and it seemed like they had the hardest time sharing a bowl of it and scraping the good stuff from it.   My family and I ended up ordering their other dishes from Pho to Bun Bo Hue to Rice Dishes.  None of them were worth the price and definitely not worth the time. I'm glad we didn't try the Lobster Pho or I would have walked out regretting that I paid for something so ridiculous.  Social media sure does cloud your judgement.",

Located somewhat centrally towards the west side of town, this place has a limited amount of parking.. only because there are a lot of other great establishments around the area.  Right away walking into this place... it's loud! This place is a bar/restaurant after all.. With many people eating and drinking and music playing.. this place is not your quiet spot to dine...   Booth style seating that can fit from 4 people to 8 comfortably.. and many tables in the center.   I came here for the Lobster Pho.. and this Lobster Pho was not something to mess with.. Market Price.. i paid around $60 for mine... i think it could've been a little cheaper given the size of the lobster. Nonetheless it was really great. Service was great and no complains about the atmosphere and vibe of the place.   Other than that, i can see myself coming back and trying other things on the menu!  Enjoy!",

OXTAIL FRIES THOOO! [:   honestly its just so good.",

After a night of heavy partying (\"getting lit\" or \"turnt\" as the cool kids like to say these days), I always find pho to be one of the best hangover cures/comfort foods to have the next morning. And this place definitely hits the spot. I ordered the pho tai nam, my standard go-to, and collectively shared an order of their \"big bone soup\" with the rest of my group. The pho tai nam did not disappoint at all. It was very delicious and satisfying. The big bone soup is also a surprise to me. Very tasty large beef bones cooked in their own broth, with delicious tendon hanging off the bone and bone marrow inside. I think they would go great with some of the other more carb-loaded dishes.  Our server was decent, but she seemed pretty busy and didn't check on us as often as we like. They also have a wicked bar selection of amazing Japanese whiskies; too bad I wasn't in the mood to have any alcohol at that point of visit. Maybe next time!  Would highly recommend this place to visit for your pho cravings in Vegas!  Pro-tip: Definitely order the big bone soup.",

    "text": "This place is a must visit while in Vegas if you enjoy asian dishes. Think your traditional southeast Asian dishes with a twist. My favorite would have to be the oxtail fries. The fries are covered in an oxtail gravy and an egg perfectly cooked sunny side up. Cut into the yoke and let it run down all over the gravy and fries! It is a unique dish that any fry lover won't be able to stop eating.   This place does offer a lobster pho bowl. The bowl is large and is sold at Market Price. That day it was a $35 bowl. The broth is pretty good. I'm not sure I would pay $35 again for a 2nd bowl. Hey, you're there for the first time, might as well right?  A definite must is the pandan creme brulee. Like most Asian desserts, it is just slightly sweet and not overpowering your sweet tooth. This hit the spot. Do not skip this.   This place was pretty busy even at 2pm on a Friday afternoon. I believe I waited about 15-20 minutes for a table for 3 people. Worth the mini wait!",

    "text": "I love their innovative dishes. Must try the big bone soup. I tried several dishes: papaya salad, oxtail french fries, big bone soup, grilled squid, and bun bo hue. I also had the Hennessy cafe su da.  Oxtail french fries look appealing but not a practical dish in my opinion, the fries were way too soggy and the oxtail marmalade just doesn't mix as it is much greasier at taste than when you have loaded fries (melted cheese and bacon). If the fries were very crispy, I'd enjoy the dish.  Papaya salad was decent but the big bone soup took the show for me. I enjoyed it as it had a lot of taste. The broth did need a lot of lime (but that is my own preference). What a presentation! Although they should consider machine sawing it to smaller piece so you can actually chew at it.   The bun bo hue was enjoyable. But the grilled squid wasn't too great for me. I enjoy Cafe Moda's squid better, it is not chewy and was too dry.  They did forget about my Hennessy cafe su da but I ended up reminding them and they comped it. Honestly I'd rather this place 3-3.5 stars but I'll give it 4 for the customer service.  Place has awesome decor and is definitely a place to try. But I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. At the price and actual product served, I think this place is for a different kind of crowd. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place at all!",

I got the half lobster and half ribeye pho and I finished the whole thing... and I never finish my pho.  This was just perfect! My boyfriend tried the oxtail pho and that was amazing as well!

    "text": "For a place that got tons of reviews and a for a Vietnamese restaurant, you would think that they would have excellent pho: a staple Vietnamese dish, especially the interesting sounding oxtail pho and and lobster pho. Unfortunately, the pho is very blan and overpriced. It was more so salty than anything, as if the salt was trying to compensate for the lack of flavor.   The oxtail in the pho was tough and difficult to eat: oxtail meat is supposed to fall of the bone!  The standout items here isn't  what you expect it to be. The garlic noodles was delicious. If you are a fan of garlic, you would LOVE as it packs a nice garlic punch. The oxtail fries was also good: the oxtail in the fries was a decent portion and was tender and marinated in a flavorful sauce.  The oxtail fried rice, was was also good, but a little on the greasy side and not really special: it did have some bits of oxtail but other than that, not overly special.  So really, other than the appetizers, the dishes here are average,at least for its price point. You can probably get real lobster separately or solid pho elsewhere in Vegas and save yourself a few bucks.",

They have a decent sized drink menu when it comes to alcoholic beverages, but as I am not really a drinker I got water.  (This is because I don't drink Soda lol). Waiters and staff were great at making sure all of our drinks were full.   After looking at the menu,  they have a variety of items,  from different kinds of fried rice and pho, spring rolls, skewers, noodles etc.    We opted for a couple appetizers to start with,  Spring rolls and Belly Buns.   Both of these were good,  spring rolls definitely taste better with the peanut sauce. Came with 4 rolls. The belly buns were delicious and a great start to our meal.  Came as an order of 3.   As for my meal I got the Pho Bo Vien.  It came steaming hot and Delicious and Of course in an enormous bowl, with a plate on the side for toppings.  I always add lots of hoisin sauce and bean sprouts.  I left completely stuffed and satisfied.     We were able to split the bill easily and left with a great dinner experience.",

I ended up ordering the pho because well I may have drank a little too much the night before and needed some hydration. It was pretty good - nothing to write home about, but nothing bad either.

We brought this up to our waiter not to expect our money back, but just to give them a little constructive criticism.

Let's just put it simply.. I feel pretty freakin' cool eating here. I definitely wouldn't mind having a photoshoot against their wall of typography. You'll know what I'm referring to once you go here. Look for the words: WTF (Where's The Food) pretty clever.  Let's move onto the menu. They keep everything pretty simple on a clip board and one sheet of paper. Yes, you read correctly... One. Sheet. Each order is pretty much broken down on the menu. They also have specials, so be sure to ask your server on that.  I ordered the steak and eggs both times. What can I say? If I like something, I really like something. The best part of this entree is the steak! It is seriously COOKED TO PERFECTION and even already cut into perfect bite sizes =') They give you a good portion size of rice and an egg on top. I'm seriously still in awe over how amazing their steak is. My boyfriend got their oxtail fried rice, which I found pretty darn tasty. My friend gets their garlic noodles. Who knew that garlic noodles could be so FLAVORFUL?!   District One, you have definitely caught my heart and stomach. I'll be back to explore more of your menu soon.",

    "text": "My friends and I were in vegas last weekend for a friends birthday and or plan was to stop by here before heading back to San Diego. We heard a lot of about this place and their lobster pho. This is probably the first time I ever heard of lobster pho which caught my attention.   We got here Sunday at 11AM and got seated right away. My friend got the lobster pho which was $40 (market price) and the rest of us got the rib eye pho, steak and eggs and spring rolls. We literally came here to see the lobster pho for ourselves and to take pictures of course! Haha my rib eye pho was $9 and the steak and eggs was $15. Although, I wouldn't spend $40 on pho even if it was for lobster but the presentation might and taste was amazing. So maybe next time I'm in town I'll order that! The broth they have for the pho is tasty and didn't taste like there was a bunch of msg in it.   The employees here were nice and constant on refueling drinks and checking up on us. The food came out quickly and didn't take too long. The amount of food that was given for the price we paid was fair. I'll be back in vegas in 2 in a half weeks. Maybe you'll catch me here again if I'm in the area!",

    "text": "I was doing some shopping at 168 Supermarket and than I found out  District One was across the street so I gave it a shot and to tell you the honest truth it was a big disappointment. I came in around 3:10 PM and I was excited they have the special lobster fried rice and also their bone in ribeye special. I waited almost 35 mins for my meal to come out I guess they got some amateur cooks back there or some sou chefs making the food. I ordered the following it's a big disappointment I don't want to do a review on it but Yelpers must know.  Server 3/5 server was apologetic and seemed friendly at first but I think she got annoyed with me because I waited for almost 35 mins for my bland food.  Lobster fried rice with cavier 2/5 for almost $50 alone this has to be top five worst fried rice I've ever had because it was oily and seemed like they use oil for frying some kind of meats or something when cooking my fried rice.   Bone in Ribeye 2/5 asked for Med Well and some of the parts came out Med cook and it was so bland and flavorless it makes Dennys ribeye mouth watering.   Garlic fries 3/5 nothing special some sauteed garlic with regular fries.  Anyways District one is a fushion Vietnamese restaurant which the real Vietnamese taste and Unami is not there. I got comp for the ribeye the manager does not want to come over and asked how was things becuase she was too busy doing nothing but chatting with another male customer. Put all things aside TK the server or one of the owners was nice and apologize for my bad experience but it won't have me coming anytime in the future.",

    "text": "My parents were in town and I really wanted to take them to Raku. But, unfortunately, their earliest reservation was 10:30 pm, so District One became plan B. Serendipitously, we were just in time to catch the tail end of happy hour. The happy hour menu features some great appetizers at 30-40% off. We started off with the fish tacos, beef carpaccio, belly buns, spring rolls, a half dozen fresh oysters, and the garlic fries to start. Of those, I really enjoyed the fish tacos and beef carpaccio. The fish tacos featured yellowtail sashimi and a lot of acid (serrano pepper, cherry tomato) wrapped in a crispy taco shell. It was an interesting take on a not so taco Tuesday fish taco. The Vietnamese beef carpaccio was the most flavorful dish of the bunch. The thinly-sliced beef was just ever-so-slightly seared and mixed with lime juice, peanuts, and onions for the most flavorful carpaccio I've had. The belly buns were their featured braised pork belly. The pork belly was very tender and the buns were perfect (I've had a lot of shitty buns), but I didn't get too much flavor. The spring rolls and garlic fries were standard fillers. The fresh oysters were huge (not the typical small, sweet ones you find) and worth a try.   As for the entrees, we were quite full from the happy hour appetizers, so we decided to split two dishes. We had to get the popular oxtail fried rice. This dish is as amazing as everyone says. The fried rice is nicely seasoned and the ox tail meat is flavored well although some portions are more fibrous than expected. No fried rice is complete without a sunny side up egg to top it off. The other dish we tried was the crispy bird nest noodle. I liked most of the food up until this point, but this noodle dish was just plain awful. It was so salty and the combination of stir-fried beef, fish balls, and shrimp made no sense. The flavors of sweet, savory, and mostly just salt made it unpalatable. The noodles were also completely fried instead of having the outside crispy and the inside soft as it traditionally is. This disaster dish aside, I liked the overall menu and atmosphere. Happy hour beers are $3-4 so check out happy hour 5:00 to 7:00 pm or reverse happy hour 12:00 to 3:00 am.",

It was huge with a super fresh-tasting lobster. And the broth is to die for! My only complaint is the amount of MSG. I felt so heavy and tired after. But while I was eating it, it was amazing. I wish we could have brought the leftovers home, but we were going to be traveling by plane.  We also ordered the oxtail loco moco, even though we couldn't find it on their menu. It was awesome. Super flavorful and cooked to perfection. The rice was not dry or too moist, and the egg was perfect and the yolk burst perfectly when you poked it with a form. My BF ate the whole thing.

My main dish was the rice platter combo with pork chops, and the sauce that came with it is EVERYTHING! It also came with an egg, which made it ever better. Who doesn't love egg on everything??? Okay, well maybe not everything, but you guys know what I mean.  Our waiter was super consistent, always made sure we were okay and not the annoying type of waiters neither.

The pho is quite light and not overly oily for a nice clean broth. The atmosphere is very edgy and hipster with their wood decor and hanging light bulbs. The manager also came to greet and chat with us so definitely a plus for good service!  Cons: the food at be a bit on the pricier end (the lobster pho expect to pay $40)... But of course it's because you get a whole lobster. The quantity is on the smaller side but you still get full.  Overall: definitely highly recommended for this Asian fusion restaurant with their delicious food, quality service, and hip ambience!",

    "text": "HONESTLY didn't know what to expect... but finally got the chance to come in especially since we promised to come in after we met one of the managers while dining at our favorite sushi joint YUMMY GRILL & SUSHI while we were eating at the bar top...  The decor of this place is simple & in my opinion if what I call cute & chic. They have a chalk wall where they have handwritten specials & social media references. They have booths along the wall & tables in the center of the resteraunt with the bar closest to the kitchen.   We were greeted right away & seated right away. Our hostess gave us a rundown of what they were all about & lucky for us we came in for HAPPY HOUR TIME which we thought ended at 6 but was informed that it ends at 7 YAY =]  Our server came right over & helped us out on what are the best items as well as showing us the portable chalkboard of their daily special! I did wish they had the prices written down though. Multiple servers checked up on us throughout our dinner & constant refills on our waters.   WHISKEY BARREL BREW BEER 15.00- I personally do not like whiskey but the hubby loves it & I love beer but he doesnt... then this large bottle of AWSOME came along & it was a whole new world & connection for us ahhaha. It was suttle & smooth with a caramely richness with a bit of chocolate bitterness. YOU JUST GOTTA TRY IT!!  VIETNAMESE BEEF CARPACCIO 11.95(9.95 HH) - WOW amazing sauce that it is served with & thinly thinly sliced beef that is rare & o so TENDER!!  SERRANO WINGS 6.95(0.50 each HH) - so crispy & hot (temperature wise) the wings could have definately used a little more seasoning itself but when you eat it with the serranos  it has some more flavor.  GARLIC FRIES 2.95HH - crispy fries with fresh sauteed chopped garlic giving it a full blast of flavor  BIG BONE SOUP 14.95 - O My... FLINTSTONES sized bones as it is served whole bones with some meat at the bottom of the soup bowl with broth! So much marrow comes out of the bones when you poke it out with the knife provided. You also get the tendon!  STEAK & EGGS 13.95 - like the traditional cubed peppered steak that most Vietnamese resteraunt serve but i would say a little different & maybe the least favorite of the choices that I ate but still good. Just different from what I was expecting.  SEA SNAIL SOUP - not really for my taste buds... ahhah the broth was a little too fish saucy for me  1/2 DOZEN OYSTERS 9.95(1.25 each HH) - amazingly fresh with awsome cocktail sauce   CRISPY EGG ROLLS 6.95(3.99 HH) - taro & pork with veggie filling served with lettuce and mint leaves  OXTAIL LOCO MOCO - a little liquidy compared to most Loco Mocos I have had but maybe that is there style... regardless the flavor is tasty goodness.  OXTAIL FRIES 9.95 - full of flavor & seriously think they use some of the pho broth to make the oxtail sauce that is drenched over the crispy thin fries.  PORK BELLY BUNS 7.95(3.99 HH) - the pork literally just melts in your mouth & the white bun so soft & chewy as it should be   COCONUT ICE CREAM - not 100% sure if they make it but the ice cream itself also has some chunks in it & it also comes in a fresh coconut shell!  PANDAN CREME BRULEE - I THINK that's wat it was called but honestly the most addicting creme brulee... rich in flavor & vibrant in color with a perfect sugar shell  Overall this is a new favorite place for Vietnamese cravings that is a GIVEN! The broth for the pho soup base also reminds me of pho back in Cali which is always comforting with blasts of flavor!",

We were told the special was razor clams for an appetizer not being told the price, it was 4 bites for $16! Ridiculous! Our check for 2 people with tip and no alcohol was about$100. Had their pho which was actually tasty, good broth. That oxtail fried rice not only took long to get but was so not worth the wait nor $16! It was super greasy and loaded with tons of fat! Yuck! The pork belly buns were cold and dry. Ugh..... The spring rolls were different....had some weird crunchy thing in the center and some type of herb that I just did not like. And their peanut sauce was bland. Uhhhhh, no matter what I ordered other than their pho was cold, dry and yuck. Even their chicken wings were over cooked! Not a happy customer. Maybe next time I come I will just have their ice cream, if I there's a next time.",

    "text": "Oxtail pho! Yum yum yum!  I kept seeing this place pop up on yelp so decided to give it a try. Turns out, pho so 1's owner's son runs this place! My family and I have been going to pho so 1 for years so when I found out, I was super excited. My mom got to the restaurant first and she was waiting outside.  As soon as Khai saw her, he ran out and told her he'd get a table started while she waited for the rest of us to arrive. What awesome service. We felt like VIPs :P  Not your typical vietnamese pho place. They have the common pho combos and also offer a variety of other fresh seafood items. I got the oxtail pho. It was ~$12, on the pricey side for pho... but totally worth it. My bowl came out with 3 huge pieces of oxtail! It also comes with a side of dipping sauce for the meat. Mix them up and squeeze a little bit of lemon and its delicious!  My sister got Mi Sate. It came out and looked delicious but it definitely was not. It tasted like someone took half a jar of peanut butter and mixed it in with her soup. Way too peanut-y and sweet. Not a fan.  One other minor complaint I have about this place is that my very Vietnamese mother had a difficult time ordering the specific pho combo she wanted. Their menu had the basics. She typically gets pho chin tai nam... not on the menu. Totally not a problem but when she tried to order, both my mother and the waitresses were confused. Neither of them spoke Vietnamese. I don't mind this at all but I know my mom wasn't too happy. She'd be more comfortable with going to a solely Vietnamese speaking establishment so I probably wont be coming here with my family but I know for sure I will be back with some friends! I really wanna try the Lobster Pho!!!!!",

    "text": "This place is truly some of the best fusion of American and Vietnamese fusion food I've ever had. Located about fifteen minutes from the vegas strip, district one is superb at bringing intense flavors to each customers dish.  Some of the dishes they are known for are the oxtail fried rice, the oxtail pho, the Mekong soup ( I believe it's made with beef, shrimp, fish balls, and pork. Also there known for the Grilled squid and the fish tacos. So when my wife and I took out friend there we offered half the menu, Lol...with no regrets. We had to eat the oxtail fried rice, pork buns, grilled squid and a few other entrees.   The oxtail fried rice was a bit salty but very unique in texture and taste. We enjoyed it and would definite try it again. The grilled squid had ok it had a few to much of a burnt taste to it and I couldn't enjoy it like I thought I could. The fish tacos we ordered didn't come with soft tacos like I was hoping they would. They were very small in size and reminded me of fried wontons. Although the fish was very small the fresh vegetables on it had great flavor and was refreshing for my tastebuds.   All in all we were satisfied with our good and the staff is very nice and attentive here. They provided excellent customer service and had no problem helping us with our orders and offer us their sound advice about dishes.  Overall we had about six dishes and our bill was about seventy dollars and that's before the tip. The serving sizes are decent and filling. Another great aspect about this location is that there open from 11am- 3pm everyday. That's definitely great when you wanna late night meal and don't wanna deal with the crowds.",

We he 5-6 different waiters/waitresses and not one gave off the impression they were our server. They were all really friendly but it was no wonder our order was wrong twice and had to wait 20 minutes for shrimp after I finished everything else.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was an off night. The food was too good to not want to go back. Especially when I saw bone marrow soup and lobster pho at the table next to mine.",

We ordered the: oxtail pho, oxtail fried rice, big bone marrow soup. Everything we ordered were delicious! My mom is difficult to please because either she thinks she can make it better or the food was too expensive but this is the first time she did not complain despite the fact that a bowl of oxtail pho is $11.95! (She was so happy that she took a business card) Her reasoning is that the bowl of pho comes with three pretty decent sized ox tails so she thinks it's worth it! The broth was tasty, the only thing is they need to add more noodles. Oxtail fried rice was decent to me. The big bone marrow soup was yum, it was like a mountain of bony goodness!! My dad wanted to take the bones back to my dog and according to the waiter, a lot of people do that!  Anyway, the second time I was in Vegas was this month and during my visit, i dined here twice! We ordered the same thing as my first visit plus we tried the garlic noodles, garlic wings, edamame. The garlic noodles were out of this world amazing! It was so simple yet so garlicky good! If you're a fan of garlic, you need to get this dish! Garlic wings were ok...I think they were like 6.95 for six wings, pretty pricey in my opinion. I didn't try the edamame but my friend liked it.",

The fish tacos didnt have much fish in them for the price paid but they were satisfying. The cornish hen was dry and lacked flavor. It looks good in pics but I'll go to Krung Siam for their version which is juicer and spicier. Liquor is not on the happy hour menu but their well vodka is Belvedere which went down really smooth at $8 a pop. Id go back to try the oxtail fried rice and get another order of the garlic fries and egg rolls.",

    "text": "I went here for happy hour last week and ended up getting chicken wings, fish tacos, pork belly buns, taro egg rolls, and french fries.  There was not anything notable about any of these appetizers.  The chicken wings and the egg rolls were good, but really nothing memorable.  The chicken wings would definitely benefit from an extra dipping sauce - like the fish sauce that came with the egg rolls.  The egg rolls had taro in them, which is why I wanted to come here.  The meat to taro ratio was off, as shown by the slightly mushy texture of the filling.  The pork belly buns come as either steamed or deep fried - I got the steamed.  The buns were not as soft as I hoped and the filling was very skimpy.  French fries were fine, but again, nothing memorable - McDonald's makes better fries.  The fish tacos were good, but tasted kinda odd - a little too fishy?  I think it's a ceviche like filling, but I'm not sure.  Although nothing was bad, I don't think I would come back here.  There are too many other restaurants in the area to try before I give this place another try.",

We tried the chicken wings and they were probably one of the best wings I've ever tried in a long time. They were spicy and had chopped jalapenos all over it. Even the jalapenos were good to eat because they tasted like they had just been chopped. The chicken had the right amount of crispiness. For my entree, you guessed it, I got the Kalbi beef ribs. The serving size was definitely enough for two people. It was really good also. It was served with en egg, Chinese sausage and riceThe meat was very tender. The staff were also very attentive. They checked on my friend and I a lot to see if we needed anything. The establishment is very spacious so you don't feel like your moves are restrictive. Lol I will definitely come back to this place.",

    "text": "BRING A HOODIE. Sounds weird? This place was freezing. Probably an ingenious plan to get you in the mood for pho in the middle of summer.   Came in to try this trendy joint. Again, the first thing you are hit with is the freezing cold. Did I mention to bring a hoodie? Yeah, bring a hoodie.  To warm myself up in the mean time, grabbed a drink. I always a major plus when a restaurant has decent beer. The Sculpin IPA is a very big plus.  The servers were prompt, showed us the specials for the day. There IS lobster pho, but we didn't HAVE lobster money this night so we opted for Oxtail Fried Rice, Pho Oxtail, and the Pho Tai Rib Eye.  The Oxtail Fried Rice ($12.95) is really overpriced. Everyone of their rice dishes seem like that. It was a good portion of rice, but I've had better fried rice (Japaniero) for cheaper. The chunks of oxtail in the rice was tender and delicious. Nothing else really exciting about the fried rice though. Lacking a flavor other than oxtail. So hope you got oxtail in every bite.  The Pho Oxtail is huge, you get the huge bone in there with plenty of oxtail for cheaper than the rice ($11.95). My Pho Rib Eye also had delicious slices of meat. I did think it was a little skimp on meat with a little too much broth. I don't know if it was just me. What I did have though, was delicious. I overdid the sriracha and jalapeno.   I ended up with bastard broth. The broth was so spicy that my head sweat and I was crying. I finished it all. Why? It was delicious.  The atmosphere and the different specials assures me that I'll be back. I will have to get lobster pho eventually and try out their different appetizers.   Did I mention to bring a hoodie?",

Spent well over an hour in the restaurant when I should've taken half as long. I get the feeling that place is more about drinking and about food. If you are interested in getting dinner, I would go somewhere else. If you have lots of time and want to have a few drinks and eat some good food then come here.  Pho was good but took way too long to come. I honk they use MSG too. Fish tacos were quite good.   Don't think I would come back since I can get pho elsewhere",

Of course, this first time back I was very un-original and ordered the pho thai ribeye steak and the spring rolls.  The spring rolls were plump and fat, meaning they were large and delish on it's own, but their peanut sauce for dipping has quite a bite, nutty and spicy!  The pho thai ribeye steak was a lot, I wish I had a larger stomach!  The broth was less MSGish, which is good, for me...I didn't leave with a feeling of heavy greasy tummy.  The flavor and aroma in their pho was just enough!  As dessert, I split a Vietnamese coffee with a colleague...talk about quality coffee!  The coffee they use is strong and aromatic.  Let's say once I left and went back to work, I was wired!    This is definitely a place I will return over and over again to try all the new creative dishes they have.  Next time, lobster pho!!!",

Location of the restaurant appears to be in a very popular and busy plaza but parking is ample to accommodate the crowds. My husband ordered the very popular \"big bone\" bone marrow pho. He enjoyed the flavor and highly complimented the taste of the broth. The soup naturally required a lot of messy work to eat and for $18 I would think it included noddles but thats an option for an extra $2. Overall though my husband gave it a 4/5. I ordered the double down which included Kalbi short ribs, Chinese sausage with a side of rice topped with an egg. Very hearty dish and good portion. I had enough leftover to take home for another meal. We ended our meal with their coconut ice cream served in an actual coconut. Delicious and the perfect end to a great meal. The highlight of our meal was definitely the pho. Can't wait to return and try more of their yummy noodle soups!",

Listen I'm all for given credit where it's due however this place just doesn't get my vote. My co workers love it and I have had their food and now tonight a chance for the happy hour! This review is strictly for the happy hour and nothing else. For starters lets talk about the joke of a menu they have for happy hour? You might as well not even offer happy hour with the half ass menu they are offering? Like cmon now it seriously only benefits people who like beer and cheap wines that will leave you with a headache? Oh and the little bit of food they have listed is a joke as well. I ordered those extremely fried chicken wings that were .50 cents a piece.. And yeah full of grease when you bite into them and extra freaking crispy, no thanks. The drinks are priced I guess we'll for beers but what about the folks that want a good cocktail on the happy hour menu! NONE of the regular cocktails are priced differently during this time frame and that sucks a lot being that most places at least list the well drinks. The service is cool but just put it like this they won't ever get another dime from me and I'm sure they are okay with it because seems from the other reviews this place is a hit! The entrees I've tried before in the past were \"just okay\" as well. The whole garlic noodle thing throws me all the way off. If the happy hour improved and they listed more relevant items I may or may not try them again but for now they are most definitely on my skip list!",

Second, decor and ambiance has a feel good feeling. The music and employees makes it a really fun atmosphere.   Third, most people wouldn't notice but they have one of the most impressive drink lists I've seen especially coming from a pho spot. I mean every single single malt Japanese whiskey you can think of and if you're lucky enough to meet \"momma\" she might have a shot of fernette with you to cure your hangover.   I can't wait to come back to this place.",

    "text": "Wooosh!! Out with the old in with the new. Out of the ashes of one of my favorite crab eating joints in the city a new restaurant is born, to replace what was once the Cravin Cajun. I've been through many of meals devouring king crab legs in what once was until one solemn day I pulled on the door only to find out it would not open no more, the Cravin Cajun was no more...  What can come next?? In my small world I would wonder who would fill that void and that space?? Until once day upon one of my travels up Jones I looked up and saw the sign...and it read \"District One\"......huh what is this I asked myself....who has replaced Cravin Cajun?!? Vietnamese fusion with flair? Has this been done before? Beyond Pho? I thought to myself \"I MUST TRY THIS\".  I tossed and turned over the loss of Cravin Cajun and waited before trying District One as if it would be a sin, I couldn't disrespect the nonexistent King Crab gods, NO I MUSN'T I would cry out, until one day after reading numerous reviews from fellow yeeps on District One I decided it was time to stop mourning and move on. If other people can get over it then I can to!! So myself and Ellen F. went there for lunch and oh it was good...  I wasn't ready to try the King Crab legs so I ordered their 5 Spice Cornish Hen with a side of the famed Oxtail Fries. I was tempted to try their Pho Ga but why when you can have it at a ton of  places down Spring Mountain (the pictures looked good btw) , let's live a little!!  I very much enjoyed the roasted hen, seasoning was good, rice was equally delicious. The oxtail fries were off the heezy! Whatever the hell sauce it is it is damn bueno. The service was fantastic, I had different servers come up to my table multiple times to ensure the lunch feast was coming along smoothly and that I had an ample amount of water to wash down this Vietnamese fusion.   I actually regretted not trying the crab legs and other interesting sounding menu selections but due to my time constraints (1 hour) and limited freedom regarding lunch (little thing called work, yuck!) I could not. Next time though!!! As I will be coming back. Oh and the prices are more than reasonable, if you haven't tried it yet it's a must among Chinatown revelers.",

For appetizers, we ordered the Vietnamese beef carpaccio dish and some garlic serrano pepper wings. The carpaccio had this super yummy sauce, which my aunt loved so much she ate it with rice! It wasn't too salty! The chicken wings were BOMB. Nicely crisped and seasoned, these wings had a kick to them! For my main meal, I ordered the pho tai nam, which came out in a pretty big bowl. They were super generous with the meat portion too! The broth was delicious and didn't taste too MSG-y as some of the pho places do in San Jose. My aunt ordered this claypot dish and my cousin ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and both seemed to be enjoying their dishes as well!   The service was very attentive here although it was pretty busy. Our waiter even boxed up my pho and our other dishes for us to take to go! I am so glad I got to eat some yummy Asian food in Vegas. Most of the time I stay on the strip and most of the Asian restaurants there are terrible. I will definitely be coming back when I'm back in Vegas! :)",

There were 2 of us so we sat at the bar, which is a full bar but we ordered their specialty drinks along with 5 food items.  Vietnamese donkey: 5/5 basically a lychee Moscow mule. Very light  Fresh coconut mojito: 5/5 it comes in a real coconut and tastes very refreshing. They also give you coconut juice on the side to drink as well  Pork belly buns: 4/5 good appetizer, nothing amazing. They used Vietnamese radish and carrots which was different but it didn't blow me away.   Oxtail fries: 5/5 I loved it! Definitely recommend this as an appetizer or even a side dish. The meat was very tender and had a pulled pork consistency. It comes with a sunny side up egg too so if you don't want it to get too soggy just put the fries to the side and break the egg on the other side and dip it in   Garlic noodles: 4/5 pricey for what it is. It was on the dry side and the garlic flavor wasn't completely there but the garnishes added a fresh flavor to it   Shaken beef: 5/5 super tender and they used the more traditional Vietnamese butter rice I believe. This entree also came with eggs and you get to choose how it's cooked  Short rib combo plate: 4/5 short ribs were marinated very well and tasty, but portion on that was small. I only got 1 small slab of kalbi and the Chinese sausages were hard so I only had a bite of that and I was done. I liked that they also included an egg in the meal so I had it sunny side up so the yolk dropped over my rice when I punctured it.. Yummmm I love runny yolk   Overall, I would defiantly recommend this place and come back to try other items on their menu",

    "text": "This used to be the Cravin Cajun place. I hadn't been to either but I was headed somewhere else for dinner and this place caught my eye. I thought maybe it would be good.  It wasn't bad but wasn't something I would go back to, either.   It has an upbeat atmosphere. Everything is kind of new inside so it looks nice. There is a giant chalkboard that somebody spent a lot of time writing the signature dishes but the chalkboard is back in a corner so being a new customer, with so much other noise going on, I didn't even notice it until halfway into my meal. There's also an 8 foot picture of their lobster pho advertisement that is also positioned in a way that only the hostess pointing it out, I would've noticed. In a dimly lit place, these types of signs need a highlight light to get noticed.  The hostess asked if I wanted a booth but I was by myself so, I decided to sit at the bar. There was a guy bartender that seemed to be eyeing me like he was going to take my order. If I sit at a bar to order food, I prefer to order from a server but I've never been here so I just go with the flow. The lobster pho obviously is something they are trying to push. I decided to try that. The price is listed as 'Market Price.' My personal opinion when a guest orders something listed with this label is that the server should suggest the price. Only after it is ordered. And, this is why...  A woman dressed in plain clothes who appeared to be either a manager or maybe even the owner because she was sitting with guests and overriding the register and accepting a delivery ( which was strange for 9pm on a Saturday night, but...who am I ). But, she casually walked by while I was eating and asked how it was. So, lemme get to that...the important part.  The lobster pho had the full shell as garnish. It was hollow but the only thing that gave the dish substance. The broth was clean and flavorful but was bare. There were the typical pile of noodles in the bottom of the bowl but the entire dish was 1. Broth 2. Noodles 3. Lobster 4. Couple slices of onion...from most to least. The flavor was right but I was hoping for more so when this manager asked me halfway through, I couldn't really give a correct assessment. If she asked me at the moment of service or after I was finished, I would probably have had more to say but asking while my mouth is full is an indication that something isn't right.   Like I said...it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to knock my socks off. Although the dish is actually more traditional than the Americanized versions that are so popular, it was only so so. And, if the bill is going to show up $40 for the pho and $5 for tea, I would prefer to have known what it was going to be priced because what started as a so so dish dropped immensely upon learning what they value as such.   On a side note, the bartender was a little personal with his questions. I understand a bartender is supposed to be a sort of quasi therapist for patrons but he acted more like he was a reporter with his questions. And, I wasn't ordering any alcohol. But, he found out that I'm involved in a community event beauty pageant for girls. He told me that one of the servers was competing but, I think he was trying to grab my attention. Problem is, while trying to get the girls attention that he pointed out to me, she was almost running from me. I didn't recognize her but she was in work clothes so I just wanted to verify. He told me her name and I still didn't recognize it so I'm wondering if this is the same as the price of the pho...deceiving and in the end, a disappointment like getting a Thai massage without a happy ending.   It's a shame because the broth was good. The place has an upbeat atmosphere but the location is bad and the prices are a little inflated for being in a rundown area and getting surprised with a fifty dollar bill for soup and tea kills any good taste in my mouth. I know seafood is not cheap but I was thinking that would be the sugar on top. Instead, it was like eating a bowl of rice and after finishing, finding out it was actual fried meal worms.   I don't think I'll return again.",

Whatever food item you order, expect it to be flavorful and satisfying to your palate. We've tried the Pho Oxtail, Coconut Pork Belly, Oxtail Fried Rice, and more of their featured dishes. All of the entrees were really good! This has been our weekend 'go to' restaurant. You'll also feel good about the friendly and attentive servers. Love it! Love it! Love it!",

We order a lot of food, so we can get a little taste of everything. We got the the chicken wings, garlic noodles, combo plate, pork belly sliders and the spring rolls.. The only thing that I really had a problem with was the garlic noodles being a little dry.. All the food that were ordered had great flavor to it.. The menu looked like there were a lot of other great things to try.. I have my eye on the lobster pho for next time. In all the food was good and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back to this place again.  Yelp 100 challenge 2016- 3/100",

First I ordered my first sake ever which one of the server recommend to me he said it was one of thier brewed drinks not sure what the name of the sake was but it had a coconut finished which was refreshing.   Also I ordered pho rebeye which was great the broth had a clean flavor which complimented the rebeye and the noodles. Did not really add anything to my broth just been sprouts for crunch and chili for heat.   Lastly I ordered the pork belly bun which was yummy!  And the pork was very tender.",

We also got the coconut ice cream for dessert and it was such a cute display! Delicious coconut ice cream sprinkled with roasted peanuts and inside a coconut shell, yum!!! It wasn't too sweet either, it was more of a refreshing taste after all the food we had haha  Definitely will be coming back to try the lobster pho that everyone is raving about :)",

Next time I will come back and try it. The price here is pretty expensive. The food is great but if you dine here make sure you are ok spending a bit more than other pho places. My oxtail pho was $15.99. The flavor of the broth was excellent and I slurped most of the broth down. Loved the meat on the oxtail. The noodles amount they give you was just right as well. They didn't give way too much noodles like other places. Our server kinda took his time and didn't greet us right away and he didn't really come back to check on us so I would probably want a friendlier and better server next time. Otherwise the food here is very good, just a bit on the expensive side.",

    "text": "BS   \"I told you to separate our checks!!!\"  I mean seriously this rating is not about just the food but the customer service.  Ok first the location - super busy area.  Parking is limited at night.  The inside is hipster authorized and designed.  It's rustic and country modern.  I love  that your waiter is quick at taking orders.  But I specified and said it TWICE to make sure we have a separate check because I didn't feel like paying for 10 people (which I ended up doing!).  Plus TIP was automatically included at 18%!!! Are you serious? Even in NYC they don't do that.  At least 15% and give me the option to pay you more.  Ok Sorry D 1 but you are about to get the BIG D from me.   So I ordered the pork rib meal - $13.99 I believe and the fried spicy calamari.  A beer and wine.  And my total ended up $180 and change.  I mean seriously? Anyway, so the calamari came! Wow that's a lot of breading for a chewy octopus.  I wish I had the jaw power of a hyena or a pitbull to eat it.  It was gnarly to chew on it.  The dip was nice and yummy.  It was spicy that it made me smile.  The  short ribs was super hard and overcooked.  The sausage that came with it was the cheap shriveled hot dog. The egg tasted like it was microwaved.  This place get's a lot of high praises but I was not happy at all.  The waiter even took 20 minutes to come with my beer.  I love the guy but COME ON! I want to get lit but instead I got burnt.  Anyway, I was charged $20 for my wife's wine.  I get that price but at least bring it in a nice cleaner glass.  Anyway, overall this place is super hyped.  I might  love it if I was just eating the chicken wings.  Maybe I'll come back during happy hour.  Overall, it was an ok experience.  It's not impressive at all.  Maybe I can be impressed next time I visit Vegas.    * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

Anyway, a lot of folks say go for the lobster pho... But I would recommend the salted pepper lobster. It's not done exactly in the same style as most salted pepper stuff, but it's pretty close. The sauce is amazing perched a top a bed of garlic noodles. I think it was the owner that came over to us and said that's actually his favorite way of cooking up the lobsters. They don't have it all the time though so we did get pretty lucky.   We also had the mekong noodles and the sirloin pho. The mekong noodles were really good... Loved the quail eggs in this. I do have to say that the pho was only ok - I would probably not order this again.   Drinks... They have some great things on the menu. My fiancee and I got the Vietnamese coffee with Henny.

The place offers Vietnamese cuisine and incorporates Japanese, Thai, Chinese, and American influences onto a menu of seafood, appetizers, rice bowls, and noodle soup.   We ordered The Big Bone Soup, OMG it was huge!! there were some bone marrow inside the bones. It was average, not really worth $17.99 but it satisfied my craving.   Happy Hour is from Mon-Friday 5pm-7pm and Sunday from 12am-2am.  From the Happy hour menu, we had Fish Tacos, Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio which was surprisingly flavorful and Belly Buns.  The service was attentive. Overall, 3.5 stars on food but I rounded up to 4 stars for the great service.",

The service was not bad as well. the parking is a PAIN in the butt tho... its always so busy in that shopping center so you literally have to circle around a bunch to shark for a parking spot.   So lets talk about the food.. One of the first things i ordered was the pork belly buns.. it was tasty but nothing mind blowing or nothing. priced at $10.  I ordered the coconut pork belly with boiled egg as my entree. Theres 3 big chunks of the meat  and an egg. The pork belly was tasty but I would prefer it to  be more tender! its on the chewy side. As a vietnamese person with having it made in my household.. its usually cut more on the smaller side and more tender! its priced at $13. It comes with a small bowl of rice and some pickled cabbage.  I also ordered the papaya salad with shrimp. its priced at $12. Its BARELY SPICY.... so if you're used to the thai style made papaya salad this is not anything like it. its ok tasting but not what I had expected. I had them adjusted it to more spicy.. which was okay i suppose but not what Im used to. kinda disappointed in this dish. I would say PASS on this dish.  my friend ordered the creme brulee i believe and it was mediocre ..nothing that wows me. I had a taste of it ...but glad i didn't order it.   Overall I would say this place is okay in food but needs lots of improvements ...service is okay as well.. ambiance is alright. I would not bend over backwards to come here.. Im not too sure if i wanna come here in the future.. probably not. I'm just not wowed by this place... pricing is kinda high and food isn't amazing.",

    "text": "My parents have been urging me to try this place, so when I finally got back to Vegas I had to make a stop here.  Went on a Sunday for lunch back in Jan.  Wasn't too hungry going in, but I was forcing myself to at least try this place.  As soon as I did a once over on the menu, my hunger grew, everything sounded delicious.  I appreciate the creativity of this place.  True definition of trying something new.  I had to start with the bao's.  Pork belly filling nothing special, but the option to have it fried, just blew my mind.  When I ordered them, the waitress asked if I wanted it fried and I excitedly replied \"why yes, not sure how the idea of fried bao's have not been a part of my life till now.\"  Of course I was not disappointed when it arrived.  Not as oily as I was concerned they would be, I was rather impressed.  This might be a new twist the a so 5 year ago trend.   Then had the short ribs, the garlic noodles and the oxtail fried rice.  I'll start with the least impressive, the short ribs.  They were good and more generous on the portion size then most restaurants, but nothing unique.  Then was the garlic noodles, look rather plain, but as soon as you take your first bite, it explodes with flavors.  They totally are deceiving.  So delicious, but you better love garlic, it is True to its name.  I was so impressed by this dish that I went home and tried to make it at home (as I don't live in Vegas so going back for seconds will take a little longer).  Lastly was the oxtail fried rice.  Ya ya ya, I had a starch fest, so what of it, just let me enjoy my meal.  The oxtail fried rice was top notch.  I'm no expert cook, but I have truly been making fried rice since I was 10 (just about every Sunday morning going up), so I know what I like about fried rice and this place had it down.  Not to oily, not to dry, also to my surprise not too much oxtail (which is a good call).  The oxtail adds a richness, but does not over power the dish and take over the flavor profile.  Over all very well done.  I want to go back to Vegas now just so I can eat at District One again.  Some many more items I want to try.",

Again, the overall experience at the restaurant was good. It just didn't send us over the top the way you would think it would (considering the venue is always picked with a line out the door). It was a little on the pricey side for Chinatown (as well as for the overall good experience).   I do have to mention that the grilled squid was absolutely delicious & presentation on point. That's my side note.   With as many opportunities in the area, it is going to be a while before I decide to go back. There is just to much to taste.   Thank you for the experience.",

I called in advance to reserve seatings for 2 but I was told they are not taking any reservation during the EDC weekend. We went anyways because of the good ratings. The customer service was good and the waiters were friendly.   This place was famous for the lobster pho and we learned that it was 50$ from the waiter there and the portion is good for 2. We ordered the lobster pho and the Vietnamese style carpaccio. The carpaccio was good I like it. The lobster pho was very disappointing; you get a whole 1.5 lb lobster, it looks ok if you don't mind it missing a few legs... when your lobster tastes mushy... you know it means it is not fresh. The broth was very salty and on top of that we were told by the waiter it was good for 2 people and nope! I really not think so... I really hate to say don't expect good seafood in the middle of a desert. We didn't order another pho because we afraid they will use the same salty broth.   We didn't like the pho but the carpaccio was nice. I may missed out the good dishes but I definitely not recommend this place if you are looking for some good lobster pho!",

You can taste the wok fried rice and the rich texture of the oxtail. A must try for the value. $12  Second dish: Garlic noodles. Its as good as you can get! We ordered it plain without proteins but Im pretty sure it would have elevated the dish if I added shrimp to it. $7  Third dish: the lobster pho! Lobster cooked anyway is going to be great! All I cared about was the broth flavor! The broth flavor did not disappoint! The lobster was just as good but it wasnt mind blowing amazing! It was definitley a one hit wonder for me..meaning its not something I would go out of my way for to order again. $49  YOLO dish!  Fast and friendly service!   Tip: this place tend to get busy. I suggest calling ahead to get an idea on wait time or going during slow hours (2pm to 5pm)",

In fact, the only thing everyone raved over was the garlic noodles, which ironically was the least expensive of all the things we ordered.  Grilled squid $13 was okay.  I think the tentacles were the best part of it, but the body lacked the char that good grilled squid gets, but maybe that's just my preference.    The fried chicken wings were extremely average to below average.  That definitely was an order that I regretted. It tasted like under seasoned crispy chicken under mound of peppers.    Now to the real reason I splurged nearly half a Benjamin: The lobster pho.  Hardly any lobster (but it does say it's only 1.5lbs) but worse yet, there's hardly noodles!  It tasted decent, but nothing that I will ever wish I could have again.  At the end of the day it just did not live up to the hype, or it's price tag.    It tasted like regular pho broth that had boiled lobster. Lol. Which is pretty much what that was. I felt the noodles were overcooked, and the lobster itself lacked the bite that one expects from fresh lobsters.  Definitely have had better without having to break the bank.",

I am visiting from east bay and have high expectation in oxtail soup because that's my all time favorite! But this, this spot is delicious! The broth was very flavorful with a generous amount of oxtail. The Vietnamese iced coffee is really good too. It's almost like home. The decor in the restaurant is nice. A little on the hipster side, but well designed with the board. My friend ordered Surf N Turf which consist of lobster and the broth. He said it was tasty. Whenever I visit Vegas again I would love to try different items on their menu. Fusion food are the best food!",

    "text": "I'm a stickler when it comes to people getting creative with pho.   Pho burrito? No thanks. Instant pho? Ew.  Pho fries? Nice try.  So as you can believe, I was not really interested in trying a lobster pho. But I gave in to the hype one day and wow. This is really as amazing as they say. This broth is freakin divine. We decided to get the Surf & Turf Pho (~$30) since it was a LOT cheaper than the $50 Maine Lobster Pho, and our server told us that they were practically the same except the Surf & Turf came with rare steak. I don't even like lobster THAT much, and now I'm a lobster pho convert. It's still so pricey, but I really do think this is worth the $. I think the only problem with it is that there wasn't enough of it. It's served in a deep dish that looks huge, but wasn't enough for two to share. It would be an average amount of food for one person. And lemme also just point out that the restaurant itself is really clean, trendy, and the beer was great.  Highly recommend if you're out in Vegas and trying to treat yo self.",

I ordered the lobster pho, which after taxes came out to about $50. The pho was good but for the price, I felt it could of been done better. If you want to present your friends with some shock value of an entire lobster in pho soup than you won't be disappointed. If I come back to the are I'd like to try other dishes.",

    "text": "LOBSTER PHO? That is what intrigued me to this place! They also have a location in Taipei!  I came with group of friends (8 people) and it was pretty spacious inside. We got seated right away and the service was great. They play some good music, some old jams, so I was digging it.   I tried: Lobster Pho: This was $49 dollars and it wasn't bad, but I wasn't amazing. They do give you a whole lobster which is great. The broth didn't really taste like lobster broth to me, but the noodles were good, very QQ. I think it's worth trying once, but not twice.  Loco Moco Oxtail Fries: This was interesting. Super creative and the oxtail was BOMB! It was fatty and meat was tender! It went super well with the fries! I recommend!  Overall, this place is pretty instagram worthy and definitely should try once! They have a lot of other great asian fusion dishes that look interesting!",

The taste of the beef bone broth and the lobster did not match at all.  They are two distinct flavors.  Since the dish was $50, they could have done something to bring in the flavors together.  It's too bad they are just lazy.  But I have to give them the fact that the lobster was indeed fresh.  Yellowtail tacos were around $11.  They were the smallest tacos that I ever saw for that price.  The taste was okay.  The did use fresh fish and added some sauce along with the mix.  Slice of lime does help kick it up a notch.  Coconut Pork Belly was also around $12.  This was disappointing.  Waitress told me that this was braised, but it doesn't look or taste like it.  I have made a better braised pork belly that these.  The colors does not look appetizing at all.  It looks like gray and it tasted just like his to looks.  Very nasty.  But I have to give them credit for the half cook egg.  That was fine beautifully.   It I also wish the egg had some of the flavor of the liquid.",

Things that were okay: Belly Buns - I like the idea that they deep fried the buns and put a soft and tender slice of pork belly inside the buns, the texture contrast was fun to eat. Flavor was fine no complaints there.  Pho Tai Rib Eye - it was a solid bowl of pho. The noodle texture was fine nice and firm and not soggy. Beef was fine but the soup was a little sweet for my taste.  Service was okay. Nothing great nothing bad.  Overall no big complaints about the restaurant.",

The staff were very attentive and our waitress Julia was fantastic and engaged with everyone. The Serrano wings were so delicious, not spicy at all, but crunchy and perfectly seasoned. We actually ordered another dozen later on! The garlic fries, beef carpaccio, egg rolls, pork belly buns (delish!), and papaya salad were tasty. The fish tacos were ok, the flavor wasn't that outstanding/bold. We ordered the ribeye Pho and the broth was flavorful, and the noodles perfectly cooked. I tried the Bloody Mary, which was pretty good. The ambience inside was very modern and clean. My mom was with us and she was happy with everything...which is a rarity since she's hard to please, especially with new fusion/modern places! That, plus the awesome service is what makes it 5 stars! Definitely a must visit!",

We were very pleased with the oysters but thought the main dishes could have used a little work. The pho was delicious! We had some drinks as well and were happy with their draft beer selection. The decor is relaxed and stylish and we enjoyed a nice leisurely lunch. Our server was very friendly and made good suggestions. Definitely worth the $8 Uber ride from our hotel, this unassuming strip mall restaurant was one of our favorite spots we visited all week!",

Also tried the spicy beef noodle and it was surprising that it had a kick to it. the oxtail pho was yummy and both the broth was good in balance.

Our party had the oxtail pho, the bone marrow soup, pho meatball, green papa salad, chef's special steak with fries & corn, and garlic noodles....all were tasty! The only warning I must give though is that the papa salad is NOT like your typical one you know and love. This one is light in flavor and has basil plus meats (shrimp, beef, & pork). Hence, very different. Pho broth was great although there was a lack of sauces and seasoning that you could add yourself...only sriracha and his on available. Service was by far the best I've had. Most Asian places lack service A LOT, but this place was top notch on service! I would highly recommend this place.",

This review is more about the marginal service and snooty/snotty attitudes of all the staff which is a deal breaker in my book.  2 of us got our Pho 30 min after everyone else at the table. I should have known this was going to happen because the dimwit waitress was STRUGGLING to take our order on the fancy iPad. Then she made up some lame excuse about they ran out of broth and it needed to be heated up. Blah blah blah........save it already.   And finally some stripper chick walked in the place, exposing her side boob to all in attendance.  I, and my family, can't unsee that.",

    "text": "It took me a while to realize this but Distrct One was on Munchie's Chefs Night Out. When we got sick of eating the food available on the strip we looked further outward and found Distrct One Kitchen and Bar. We came around dinner time on a Saturday night but was seated almost immediately upon arrival.  What drew my here was the Lobster Pho. Little did I know it was going to be $50 for a bowl...so we decided to grab some quick bites before heading out into the night. We started off with the Fish Sauce Glazed Chicken Wings. Fried perfectly on the outside and still retaining its juicy tenderness inside, the fish sauce glaze was spot on. While pungent, like any fish sauce type dish, it still had that perfect balance of sweet and tangy but nothing overpowering your palate. With the pork buns, I greatly appreciated the addition of pickled carrots and radish that added another layer of texture. The pickled vegetables really helped balance the heaviness of the oyster sauce and fatty pork. And that fatty pork...soooo tender..so fatty...so guilt inducing. We finished out the meal with their oxtail fried rice. For the $12, you get your money's worth with their generous portions and plentiful amount of shredded oxtail. I loved finding the random large clumps sprinkled here and there. Coming with a fried egg helped add a savory texture to the already flavorful fried dish.  Service was decent. They were quick to seat us and explain the menu. Once our order was taken we were rarely checked on beside the refilling of water. When it came to paying for our bill they disappeared with my card for quite some time before returning with the menu.   Now seeing how great our meal of apps and side dishes were, I really wonder if the Pho Lobster would be worth $50. If they can take items as simple as chicken wings and fried rice to a new level, I'm excited to see what they can do with Pho.",

The ultimate goal tonight was to get my hands on the Oxtail Fries(not on the happy hour menu). We got to try the wings, pork buns and fish tacos. The wings let me tell you are divine. Super crunchy and full of flavor without having to drench it in sauce. The pork buns are always a safe and flavorful bet. The tacos though were a disappointment. I saw no fish, only avocados and the other veggies that were inside. It had flavor but it's called fish tacos for a reason. The restaurant was clean, the waiters were friendly and there was no wait for a table. Can't wait to visit again!!!",

I'd have to ask for every frking thing... veggies for the phos. A server brought out 2 veggie plates for 7 bowls of pho... & the last bowl of pho came out after 6 of us finished our foods. Rediculous! & my bone marrow order was given away to the next table and a server said they ran out.... okay... && no apologies! The server said \"I guess we gave it to them, yup.\" Not my luck at restaurants lately. Felt disrespected.",

    "text": "In Las Vegas, you probably can relate to how everyone eats at the \"hotel\" part of Vegas. And they forget that Las Vegas is a city with homes, schools, and restaurants. But District One feels and tastes like the Gordan Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen. The food was great as the steak and eggs I ordered was juicy and cooked to perfection. The service was quick,under five minutes, and note that I'm a kid, so that means for me to say that the sevice was fast, it means fast. As kids are super impatient, our sever, Dash, was great at recommending foods and was super nice. When I first came, I did'nt think this would be so great, as you know, anything that's not connected to the hotels in Vegas but at Vegas is not that popular. Overall, this is a great place to eat if you have enough money to dine at the buffets at the hotels or if you're trying to save money, the food was super good and I hope this message spreads out to other people so many more can try this cusine.",

The location based off value is not amazing since it's considered a high end viet location, however the food is amazing and I do recommend you to try it when you stop by Vegas. You won't regret it!",

I couldn't understand the rave on this. Personally felt it was salty, noodle over cooked, lobster was mushy, soup did not have lobster flavor. Really not worth the money or taste. Garlic noodle was dry and didn't had much garlic taste, this could be the worst garlic noodle I've had. Skipping our third dish, not worth mentioning. However, their service was friendly and attentive which is great. Didn't want to rate 3 stars but felt everyone should know lobster pho is waste of your money.",

Naturally we had to try one of each! The lobster pho broth is very light, and you get a decent amount of lobster with your pho. My oxtail pho was delicious, complete with a nice rich broth. The big bone broth was a sight to see! They even give you a straw to suck out the marrow.   We also ordered calamari, belly buns and oxtail fries to start. All fantastic!",

Major props for shrimp with heads on.  REALLY looking forward to them getting their liquor license because the meal warranted some serious beer.  Our server was excellent and attentive.   A few gentle suggestions since I know they are brand new:   1. The little pieces of garlic/serrano didn't really stick to the wings. The pieces that fell into the accompanying daikon salad were delicious though! Would love to have more of that flavor on the actual wing or maybe a special dipping sauce?  2. Would love to see Banh mi on the menu.   3. Also, could use a delicious baguette to soak up the D1 Goodness in the shrimp boil.  4. Maryland blue crabs added to the seafood boil menu when in season.

Not only is the food pretty darn good, but the place is CLEAN, with a full bar, and service staff that not only speaks English, but is very friendly, too. D1 has my favorite things to eat in LV: pho, peel and eat crawfish/shrimp in spicy sauce, and fresh spring rolls that actually has fresh herbs in it. Kudos to D1 for paying attention to details: gloves, a bib, and extra bowl pre-set on the table for the shells rather than dumping the shells on the table, egg rolls presented on a bamboo tray, spring rolls looking fresh, cut in half for easy consumption, and did I mention the restaurant is CLEAN?!  On my first visit, I ordered crawfish in spicy D1 sauce and fresh spring rolls. The crawfish were huge and succulent and the sauce was nice and spicy. I mean, my lips turned a shade of red that I wish I was a lipstick color. However, I would have to say that I do favor Hot n Juicy's sauce, but I have no problem batting for the D1 team if they continue to be consistent with their service and food. Looking over their menu, I can't wait to come back for more because I know I'll be a regular for sure.",

I ordered the lobster pho to share, oxtail fries of course, and a few other appetizers which were all tasty.  I'm not a big french fry person, but I highly recommend ordering them.  They do a happy hour each day and I definitely plan on coming to that.  The staff is young & friendly. They will talk to you and recommend items as well as just chatting.",

Atmosphere was really nice and relaxing and it wasn't too busy.  We ordered some drinks at the bar before we got seated. The hostess was really sweet and sincere. She sat us at a big booth, that was able to sit the 6 of us. We started with 2 orders of the fish tacos. 1 taco each person and they were mini. Tacos were good, but literally were a teaser. I then ordered 2 fresh springs rolls that came with 4 per order. They were your average spring roll, but still very good. Then we were ready to order, I ordered the oxtail fried rice with an over medium egg. My bf ordered the District 1 combo rice platter which came with short ribs, kim chee, chinese sausage, and either your choice of garlic noodles or white rice. He chose the white rice. Our friends at the table ordered the Birds nest which was crispy noodle chow mein, and also got an order of the grilled squid which was really gooood and not rubbery. Everything was cooked really good and tasted even better.  I would definitely come back to this place and try their lobster pho, which is their most popular menu item.",

We had a prix-fixe menu with oysters on the half shell, pork belly buns, cured beef dish, fried rice, squid, fried fish, and a few other dishes I am forgetting. The only complaint I have was that the squid was too spicy for my liking and was over-grilled. Otherwise everything else was delicious! Seriously, this place tastes ten times better than how it actually looks. It looks like any normal pho place but tastes better than any Vietnamese restaurant that I've ever had. Their cuisine is definitely modern and trendy and everything is packed with flavor.  Then the drinks! I had a moscow mule with a lychee and this was very good. There was also a coconut mojito that was served in an actual coconut and this was also delicious.   For dessert, we had the creme brulee which was pandan flavored, I believe (like the green Asian fruit cakes, if you're familiar with those). And I did not think I would like it since I'm loyal to the classic creme brulee but this was once again, delicious! Packed full of flavor.  I will be CRAVING this place while I'm in Oregon and now I have a new, more trendy Asian restaurant that I can take my parents to - they're very traditional and mostly like only Asian food.  Must-try!!!",

This was well seasoned and prepared w/the nice contrast of flavors from the topping and further accented w/the pesto on the bottom of the seared potato mash. This place is smart too, because the bowls of soup come in one good size, to make things quick and simple. The lobster ribeye was an even better portion reasonable for the type of food you get. This is a place I can appreciate because of the young fusion aspect that our Era or generation now have grown to expect. I would recommend this place if your into Asian and American variety or looking for a place to hang out w/a group for some fun.

I ordered the ox tail pho which had a lot of meat, but the broth was over powered by star anise flavor. The fish tacos very good but nothing special about it. The goi ga (chicken salad) had a fish sauce dressing which was very sweet.... Too sweet for my tasting. The big bone soup, their speciality.. The meat on the bone was soft and tender, but the marrow the god's butter was extremely cold which made it hard to eat. The broth was the same broth use for the pho so again too much star anise. The best thing was the coconut mojito which was tasty and refreshing. Overall I'm glad I was able to try this place out but I don't think I'll ever be coming back.",

    "text": "Seriously, not much gets me more excited about coming to the sparkling lights of Las Vegas than money, booze and strippers. Ok I'm lying, I also enjoy the arcade games at Circus Circus and the Bellagio Fountains a great deal but recently District One Kitchen & Bar has resoundingly become one of the reasons I desire coming to Sin City more than I already do.  The Vietnamese inspired food here is simply just amazing and is only rivaled by the incredible service, ambiance and family-friendly vibe this cozy hangout offers up in droves. Oh if these walls could talk, it's the joint to meet up with friends to watch the game, share some drinks, have some laughs, nurse that hangover and have damn good eats. Inventive menu selections include live Maine lobster pho, Surf n Turf pho (lobster and tender slices of ribeye) and oxtail anything. The food presentation is also spot on, for those who love to post their meals on social media (you know who you are) a post from here will guarantee 100 likes and new followers. But seriously, there's really something for any type of mood you're in. I mean let's be honest pho can cure all maladies, I know I eat it to stay young and virile, but the stuff can probably cure Ebola too.  Well, if you're a fan of fun and good food then swing your way on down here and give it a whirl, don't take my word for it. With a full bar, a bodacious staff of waiters and waitresses who are ready to pour your next shot of Fernet or glass of Veuve Clicquot, it's a for sure good time that is certainly Vegas worthy. There's a reason they've recently been named Best New Restaurant of 2014 by Las Vegas Weekly. I'm already planning my next adventure to my home away from home and D1 is going to be on my agenda at least a couple times.",

We sat at a booth, but there are tables and a bar to sit at during the wee hours of the night. We showed up here after dinner for some cocktails, yet we ended up eating a second dinner. Cocktails are awesome here-i got the juniper and spice, which has thai basil, gin and chili peppers. Fresh spring rolls came out and they are my favorite- there was something different about them though. They are fresh on the outside with the rice paper wrapped fresh raw veggies and herbs, dunked in peanut sauce, but they also feature a crispy center of fried wonton crunchiness. King crab is served broken into easy chunks with spicy aioli on top- so good. Min Ahi tuna sashimi tacos were also ordered and shared- now these were good! I cannot wait to come back for pho and rice and the crispy bird nest- sounds amazing. Definitely arrive hungry!",

    "text": "District One is an upscale sports bar styled Vietnamese fusion restaurant, nestled in Chinatown amongst a number of other Asian restaurants in a strip mall. I was definitely not expecting a modern atmosphere, and was happy not to have to wait in line at around 11:45am for lunch before my flight out. Highly recommend making the trek from the strip for some good Vietnamese eats here!  * Ox Tail Fried Rice - 5 stars: The oxtail fried rice was chock full of delicious ox tail, large pieces though a little oily as expected. I liked that it was not overly fatty. My favorite dish here! * Pork Belly Buns - 5 stars: Recently went to a food event, Cochon 5050 in Napa which featured  restaurants serving all types of pork. This dish could stand head to head against those dishes. So tender, so flavorful, meaty, delicious! Pro tip: you can order half fried half steamed. Both good but prefer fried for a crispy chewy bun.  * Ox tail pho - 4 stars: Decent pho, have had better noodles. Broth was quite good and there was a lot of tender nonfatty oxtail meat - came with 2 large pieces. I think next time I will opt for the lobster pho. * Chicken Wings - 3 stars: Needed to be bigger and meatier. Too small, tasted dry, and very salty.  * Side soup - 4 stars: salty goodness. Huge bowl only $3.  * Chicken Salad - 2.5 stars: tasted like shredded Costco chicken breast chunks on cabbage. Dressing was just ok. Prefer le Pho.   The service was awesome, the food was great - can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu! Come early, the restaurant was full with a line at 1230pm on a Saturday!",

I pretty much ordered everything on the happy hour menu and loved most of it. The chicken wings were delicious and crispy. I didn't care for the fish tacos but all my friends loved it. Oysters are fresh and decently sized. Only dish I didn't like was the beef carpaccio. Me and my friends felt it was TOO raw. I enjoyed this restaurant and I'm excited to try their dinner menu.",

There's usually no wait when I come but it does get pretty busy.   Here are a few things I've tried: - Shrimp and pork spring rolls, one of my favorites because I love the dipping sauce that comes with it. Only down side is that it only comes with 2 spring rolls cut into 4 pieces for $6. Pretty steep in my opinion, but I always order it anyways.  - Pork belly buns: meh, they were okay. I've had better elsewhere.  - Pho dac biet: my bf always orders this, he seems to like it. No complaints.  - Ox tail pho: yum! My favorite because the meat literally falls off the bone! They give you a good amount of ox tail as well. The broth is super flavorful. I crave this and I wish we had a good ox tail pho place back in LA.  - Mekong River noodle soup: was not a fan, stick to the pho  Food takes some time to come out, but service is always friendly. Will be back the next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "We wanted to be adventurous one night so we decided to try District One. Once we were there, I remembered that I had been there once when I first moved here, but I couldn't remember anything besides the interesting drink menu.  The decor inside is kind of a mix between a casual restaurant and a sports bar. They have a lot of interesting-sounding dishes, but unfortunately, a lot of them do not live up to their interesting descriptions.  The garlic chicken wings were probably the last thing we ordered that came out, and I was excited for them the whole time we waited. By the time they came, they were pretty disappointing. Very dry and no flavor on the outside. When I asked for any sort of sauce they thought could go with it, they brought me a chipotle mayonnaise, which was really unappetizing and does not go with chicken wings.  We got the short rib, which was alright, but extremely salty, to the point that I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  We also ordered a papaya salad, as my boyfriend love love loves those, and he said it was the worst he's had :/ After having a few papaya salads since then I would have to agree. It was just not made the same way they usually are - very little flavor and no crunch to the salad.  On a high note, the garlic noodles were very good as was the steak tartare, which I believe was titled a vietnamese take on the dish and I found it to be uniquely tasty.  The dessert was the best part of the meal. Coconut ice cream inside half a coconut - very delicious, crisp and not overwhelmingly sweet.",

    "text": "Long overdue review!  I personally think District One is underrated. I've been several times in the past few years - and my experiences have all been quite delightful!   Food:  Pretty good, however, the main reason why they get 4 stars and not 5. It's not over the top impressive but there are some tasty dishes I've enjoyed!   - Shaken Beef Salad: Greens topped with Extremely tender pieces of flavorful marinated meat and dressing   - Grilled Whole Squid  A dish I never get sick of, sliced grilled squid that comes with a spicy (siracha mayo?) aioli for dipping   - Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup  Great heat, decent flavor, not a lot of noodles but comes with a variety of different meats   I've also tried various specials of the day including fresh oysters, king crab legs, whole boiled sea snails (in the shell) - all were tasty and unique  Service: Very friendly bartenders and servers! Servers are knowledgeable about the menu and provide the specials of the day, which always vary   Ambiance:  Hip and visually appealing. Lots of seating available: bar, tables, and booths. I love the large comfortable booths!   Overall District One is a fun spot to grab food and drinks, great for all occasions. If you haven't checked it out I would definitely recommend it!",

The rice was nicely steamed. I did not have any dried pieces of rice like how some restaurants serve their rice. The pickled veggies were done just right.perfect balance of sweet and tangy. My BF ordered the coconut pork belly...he thought it was going to be fried...but it's a soup with a sour bite at the end...not for me. But he liked it. We also ordered the Vietnamese donkey and Viet Chelada and they were both really flavorful and unique...great creation by the restaurant. My Chelada was nice and toasty and the bits of toasted sesame seeds gave a nice texture to it too. The other drink was sweet but not over powerful. We'd definitely recommend the restaurant and return soon.",

A huge plus for me was that they had NBATV. The music is also nice, setting a \"hip\" atmosphere.  District One has an impressive bar selection. Usually, I would order a Blue Moon. Enter: Kronenbourg Blanc. I was introduced to Kronenbourg Blanc at District One, and I am glad that I have stumbled upon it. I haven't found many restaurants that offer it, but it's better than Blue Moon!  I ordered the steak and eggs. It contained small cut pieces of steak, tossed around in some sauce, tomato rice, and a fried egg. Not your typical steak and eggs, but this tasted pretty good.  They have pho oxtail as well here too, which I recommend. Their broth is better than most in Vegas which are bland. Another famous dish they have is the lobster pho, which is great for pictures. Not to also mention their Big Bone soup, which consists of a huge bone where you can stick a long spoon in and get all of the bone marrow goodness!   Great atmosphere, place to watch the games, and grub!",

My (so-far) favorite is the the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio. Thinly sliced with a mix of citrus soy, truffle oil, sesame, and peanuts. It's simply mouthwatering, melt in your mouth good.

Not sure what's worse, that or UNLV losing to Northern Illinois... Pathetic and Pathetic-er.  Okay, done venting.  So it is great to find a cool ASIAN bar where you can actually watch games!  And they come with great food, which is double great!  $20 pitcher of Heineken is a bit steep, but it does fill up about 6 tall glasses and it comes in those pitchers with built in ice cooler.  Miller Lites are $15 for the pitcher, if you're looking for better bargains.  The food is more Vietnamese fusion than diverse Asian, but no matter, it's still good stuff.  We had a few dishes:  Ox Tail Pho, Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings, Beef Lemongrass skewers, and Calamari.  The pho was fantastic, calamari was great, and wings and skewers were good but not great.  The meatiness of the ox tail and the light & crispy batter on the calamari stood out.  There are other interesting dishes we want to try out, which will have to wait for the next time.  The real winner that is a great accompaniment to the good food is the atmosphere.  Wait staff was great for the most part, and like a typical Asian restaurant they don't have \"designated\" sections for each server so you can flag anybody down for what you need.  They're very good about coming around and waiting on your table, and many of them were even social with the customers in a pleasant and non-intrusive way.  Big ups for the wait staff.  There are TVs all around every section of the place, so wherever you sit you will have multiple views of the action.  Wish the TVs were a bit bigger though, although they were close enough that it wasn't a bother.  Great atmosphere, great wait staff (including the super cutie that appeared to be the hostess/manager?), and great food all make for a great \"bar\" that deserves at least 4.5 stars.  Oh, the tab came to $150 before tips for the 4 of us, but I suppose when you order 4 $20 pitchers... but the price is a bit steeper than your typical Vietnamese.  Table-for-1 Factor:  I'm not seeing this place as a great atmosphere for sitting alone (might be awkward), but there is a bar with good 8-10 bar stools if you have the inkling.",

    "text": "Awesome Vietnamese joints are a dime a dozen in Vegas, so let me tell you why you should choose this one.  First, the whole place can only be described as stellar Vietnamese food meets hip, modern, clean Brooklyn-hipster decor meets Texas BBQ-sized portions. Allow me to elaborate:  - I have gone here three times in the last week, each time with a big crowd. This means I've sampled a lot of the menu. Must eat: eggrolls with lettuce wrap, thai basil, radish; pork buns pork buns pork buns; steak Pho--I almost never get pho anywhere because I find it boring, flavorless, and not-filling. This is not the case here. This is, hands down, the best pho I've ever had; fish tacos  - This place is huge and clean, with \"chalkboard\" walls, long tables, concrete floors, and plenty of room to spread out. It's not one of those drab, dark, maroon carpeted joints that Spring Mountain has plenty of.   - The portions are enormous. Every plate is just overflowing with goodness.  On top of all of that, the service is great. Friendly, attentive but not overbearing, and speedy. This is clearly a family-owned and run establishment and it's likely that the people telling you about the specials and serving your food have a vested interest in making sure you have an excellent time, and it shows.",

    "text": "I have been here twice now and and it's because this place had a lot of buzz over the summer. Even though I am really curious as to how the oxtail pho is I have yet to try it. Since this is an Asian fusion place, both of the times I brought visitors here from out of town and the food did not disappoint. For the most part they execute their dishes pretty well. Often times Asian fusion restaurants tend to over due it as in \"trying to hard,\" but that is not the case here because their fusion is just a slight twist on the original dishes. The first time I was not too hungry and I ate the tacos which were phenomenal. The light crispness of the wonton and then the freshness of the yellow tail make it a match made in heaven. Although delicious they are super small and kind of pricey for what you pay for. However, I guess the fresh fish constitutes it. On both of my visits we ordered the tacos and they did not disappoint any members of my party. The second time I had the combo platter with the beef short ribs and I do love me some short ribs. I am usually not a fan of Chinese sausage, but surprisingly I ate what was served on my plate because the flavor wasn't too overwhelming like it usually is. I must say I originally ordered the pork chop but then it was served with short ribs. Our server who took my order even saw the short ribs on my plate and immediately told his co-server that it's supposed to be pork chop. I was hungry and did not want to wait so I didn't mind the short ribs at all. My 2 other friends who were with me also ordered the combo platter but with both meats. I tried the pork chop from their plate and thought it was good. This place is pretty popular considering both times I've come here I've bumped into people I know. My friend ordered a coconut martini and it was served in a coconut, pretty awesome I must say. That's probably Asian fusion at it's finest. I've also been told by 2 friends that the coconut ice cream is to die for. So I must try that the next time I'm here. In regards to service, service is pretty good. On my first visit our server was Adrienne and she was pretty spectacular. The other members of our party could not decide to order so she basically gave a description of everything on the menu. She even gave my friend suggestions on what to order based off of what he craving. She was really patient and pleasant during our entire dining experience. This place has definitely become a stable in town and it certainly is one now in my book.",

The ambiance was super cute for a Vietnamese spot, definitely different from your normal pho place. Since the time we were here last, they jacked up the prices a few dollars! $14 for oxtail pho?? I can get that back home for $7 and it's way tastier. Also tried the pork belly braised in coconut juice... $10 for 3 pieces of pork and 1 egg. I think my grandma would freak out if she knew I paid that much for \"thit kho\". Service was great but not sure if its worth it to come back.",

I also ordered the snails which was one of their specials. It was so good. I wanted to try the razor clams but they didn't have it that day. But the snails were delicious - very sweet and most of the snails were a good size. Service was good from the hostess. I had a lychee martini  - at first they didn't have lychee because they ran out but somehow they got some for me. From the pictures, I thought the restaurant was more fancy but when you enter the restaurant, it has a more casual dining vibe. I will definitely come back to try their bone marrow soup, lobster pho and maybe some of the desserts. Highly recommend - especially for the unusual items like razor clams and sea snails!",

I just think they were a little small for $6 for two tacos.  *Sea Snails were okay. They gave you at least 10 and they're the big sea snails too. I just thought they needed more seasonings.  *Pork Buns weren't that good. It was kinda dry and the meat was small. I wouldn't order it again.

I literally said to myself, \"Why did I get clams and basil here when it's so much better at a traditional Chinese restaurant?\" I thought the the proportion of fat to meat in the pork belly buns was overwhelming. The fish tacos, I don't even remember them enough for an accurate description.   It's unlikely we will return here. It's just too mediocre.",

A group and I came on a Sunday night, and we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess - All of the staff was incredibly friendly!  They had an eclectic menu, filled with lots of meats and fish. I am not a big meat or fish eater, but I was able to order some dishes that were more veggie-based. I started with a pear cocktail and some tofu-veggie rolls. Their cocktails are incredible! I sampled a few others and would come back for these cocktails alone ;) The tofu spring rolls were quite filling and had some sort of tempura crunch at the center.   The group ordered a bunch of other items including oysters and fish tacos, but I just took pictures, since that really wasn't my thing. I ordered the \"Bird's Nest\" with veggies only. This thing was massive! I don't think I have ever had crispy noodles again, but they were so tasty, covered in a savory gravy (and would definitely help if your'e getting over a hangover fyi). The gravy combined with the crispy noodles softened the noodles into a smoother texture. And all of the veggies on top created a dynamic flavoring to the dish.   The table finished off with two orders of creme brulee. This was no ordinary creme brulee. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the primary ingredient, but the green filling tasted more earthy (in a good way) than the normal version. Topped with raspberries and powdered sugar, this was definitely a memorable dessert.",

    "text": "Found this spot on a list of \"best Vegas restaurants\" so decided to drop by for lunch over the weekend. It's nestled among a bunch of different Asian restaurants and businesses in a charming Chinatown strip mall. The inside has a casual kind of punk-rock feel with natural light illuminating the darker color palette.   I thought the western-influenced Asian food was tasty but none of the dishes were truly exceptional. Of the small plates, we sampled the sea snails, fried calamari, and yellow-tail fish tacos. The sea snails had to be coaxed out of their large shells with a stick and fork; they were meatier than other escargot I've had in the past, and the natural ocean-like flavors weren't overly masked by butter and garlic. One or two were a treat, but the strong flavor sort of overwhelms your palate after that. The tacos were nice, but I wish the buttery yellowtail flavor shone more strongly with each bite. The calamari was the best appetizer in my opinion. The exterior was crunchy, but the inside was tender and the seasoning was just right. The accompanying aioli was on point as well. For dishes, we chose the Pho Oxtail and Coconut Pork Belly. The pho broth was fairly standard and underwhelming, but the meat was flavorful and abundant in the bowl. The pork was very rich and, similar to the snails, almost TOO much of a good thing. I also couldn't really identify the taste or fragrance of coconut in the rice. Overall, I enjoyed the dining experience at District One and it was well worth the trip. I should also note that they're drinks were a big hit, particularly their refreshing non-alcoholic juices with restorative ingredients like honey and ginger.",

As someone who needs to eat gluten free, District One has options.  I've had the pork belly dish and oxtail fried on other occasions, but this time I was craving a spicy bowl of Bun bo Hue.  They offer it here and it is marvelously spicy.  The broth did not disappoint. It had numerous flavors that gave it a depth that other Vietnamese restaurants can't seem to achieve.  It was almost too spicy for me.  I really enjoyed it though and would come again to try other options.",

It felt like we were going way out of Vegas, but the Uber ride was still only $8, we ended up in Chinatown.  District One, what a find. We had the Pho. When they tell you it is spicy, believe them. We order the Spring Rolls. Amazing. But the winner for us was the Oxtail Fried Rice. This is hands down the best Fried Rice I have ever had. In my life. If you come here, this is the must order. I also had the Vietnamese Mule, which is their version of the Moscow Mule. It was also the best Mule I have ever had.  For all three of us, the food and cocktails - $54.

    "text": "Went to Vegas for my birthday and District One was my first stop. Love the atmosphere, very modern and fun. Service was fast and attentive as well. We opt out of getting the lobster pho but we did get oxtail pho and just a regular pho. A good Vietnamese restaurant shouldn't butcher pho, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Yes, I've had better pho but the pho wasn't the star of the show anyways. We also got garlic noodles and paired it with their grill squid. Grill squid paired with their sauce on the side was amazinggg. Highly addictive and paired well with the garlic noodles. We also got the double down, which was probably the most disappointing dish we got. Nothing spectacular, can't really mess up rice, lap xuong, meat and eggs. The oxtail fried rice was definitely more worth it if you're going to get a rice dish. Very flavorful and filling. For the five of us, it was barely $100 and we were all full and satisfied. Would definitely return.",

I ordered black pepper garlic noodle with lobster, 1/2 dozen oysters, fish tacos, oxtail Pho, wine, coconut ice cream. Nothing special about oysters.. not as fresh as we expected. Fish tacos were decent, however, super small!!! Oxtail Pho was shared by my kids. I tasted the broth and it was good but my husband felt it has msg in it.   Biggest disappointment was the garlic noodle with lobster. The noodle was soggy and super salty. Lobster was small and salty. A lot of oyster sauce in this dish. We ended up trying to eat the lobster to justify paying $50 for it. Let the waitress know the dish is so salty... prob can tell from all the noodles and some lobster being leftover and not bother to pack home .   Coconut ice cream is actually very good. Very creamy.   Overall, not coming back nor recommending to friends.",

The lobster had some sizable pieces including the claw and the ribeye was of higher quality.   The only drawback to the \"Surf and Turf\" pho was that they do not give you as much noodle and it was fairly expensive. It came out to a whopping $33. I would say that you should either try the \"Maine Lobster Pho\" or \"Surf and Turf Pho\" at least once, but its probably something that I would only get once.   They seemed to have a decent collection of whiskey here. I was surprised that they had the Yamazaki Japanese Whiskey which is a definite plus.",

Definitely a bit pricy since I am used to spending around $10 for regular beef pho, so spending $50 can be hard to digest, but considering you are getting a full lobster, which was very fresh, I think this was worth trying! Broth was nice and doesn't feel greasy or filled with MSG that you would get from other pho soups.   We also tried the pork belly buns, which come with 3 buns. They give you the option to have the buns fried or regular and since we typically have had the regular ones we decided to try something different and get 2 fried and 1 regular. The fried ones were ok, but if I had to go back I would definitely stick to the regular versions. Overall it was pretty good.",

What we ordered:  Serrano Pepper Wings (6pc) .50 ea Belly Buns (2) $3.99  Crispy Egg Rolls (4) $3.99  Green Papaya Salad $5.99  Garlic Fries $2.99  I was really happy with it, especially the Green Papaya Salad.  I couldn't stop telling my co-workers how much I enjoyed it.  It was great in taste.  Not to salty, nor to spicy.    I didn't care too much for the belly buns.  They were just okay.  The garlic fries, wings and egg rolls were decent.  The wings had the right amount of heat.  Service was good.  Made reservations and when I got there it wasn't busy.  Waiter told me to pick a seat.  I was offered a drink when I sat down and the staff was attentive to when the rest of my party arrived.  I did wish they had calamari on the Happy Hour menu.  So with that being said, I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.  Happy Eatings!",

The lobster pho is never a disappointment. The broth is very flavorful and you can taste the lobster that was cooked in the broth- it's worth every penny.  I'm not sure what they did differently with the oxtail pho but I've become addicted. It was okay before but now it's AMAZING. The meat is so tender and flavorful we keep coming back for more. It'a now one of the top places in town for oxtail.  The king crab with spicy aioli is fairly new and is a must try. They did an excellent job with the flavors although it was a bit spicy for me. I don't eat too much hot food but that certainly didn't prevent me from finishing it.  Although pho-ghetti is no longer on the menu, I'm mentioning it in hopes that it will return one day. It was such a unique, delicious dish that I was coming at least once a week for it.",

They have Happy Hour from Monday to Friday 5pm-7pm and Monday to Thursday 12am-2am. There is a young camaraderie and casual feel in the atmosphere, and there are plenty of seating. If you enjoy the sports channel, they have at least 10 televisions at every angle. So it doesn't matter where you sit, you will always find something to watch.  Even though the menu looks simple, the meal that they create are full of flavor. I chose the Garlic Noodles ($7.99) with Chicken ($3) and Mix Vegetables ($3). My order came with egg noodles sauteed in wok fried garlic, tender chicken, broccoli, slice carrots, onions, chunks of zucchini and yellow squash, and cilantro. I really love the garlic noodles and how they leave a little crunch in the mix vegetables. It taste perfect!  What intrigue me most is how on point the service is. It didn't take long for the food to arrive and during my meal they ask if everything is okay. They also come by to refill my drink and I really appreciate how they handle payment efficiently.",

The reason this place only gets four stars is because whenever I order the oxtail fried rice, they put soooo much onions. Im not an onion hater, but its like they barley even cut the onions (see photos). So I would recommend anyone to just order light onions.  Also almost everytime the egg comes overcooked. It tastes good however the egg comes, but why ask how I want my egg (over easy) when it almost always comes with a completely cooked yolk.",

My tongue tingled after just eating some braised veggies and some meat off the bone in big bone soup. And my one-year-old got rashes & swelling all over his face and neck after I fed him about half cup of big bone soup and some broth and veggies.  We had to rush to the emergency to have him checked out. I don't mind spending $$ on a good meal. But the truth that my son and I suffered because of the food really pissed me off. All restaurant owners should have the guts to inform the customers about MsG if added to the food.",

Full of locals and visitors alike, District One gives off an aura of welcomness.  Cozying up to the bar, we order some drinks then peruse the menu.  A few items jumped out right away.  The grilled squid with spicy mayo and sea snails in an aromatic broth.  I really wanted to like both dishes, but a few minutes too long cooking proved both items to be a bit chewy and less enjoyable.  The flavors for both were quite enjoyable.  The broth of the sea snails was exceptional despite the chewy shell inhabitants.  The squid remainded me or the same I saw in travels oversea, but these were overcooked a bit too much.  Another friendly and knowledgable bartender provided an upbeat, casual environment providing some other dining options for us to try.  The menu seemed to cover a lot of different food types and the energy of the restaurant was upbeat and energetic.  I'll give this place another try, but will look towards items of the meat style for eating.",

This is located is the Chinatown (Asian area) of Las Vegas so you're going to have to drive out of the tourist-ridden strip.   I ordered the grilled squid which was way overcooked and chewy so I can't recommend that dish. However, I told my waiter and he gladly sent it back and I ordered what I originally wanted: District One Rice Combo Platter with Short Ribs & fish sauce. Absolutely delish!  This place is unpretentious and serves really good food at reasonable prices. We had a Filipino server and he was personable and funny. Great location among many other Asian restaurants and worth the extra miles to get there. Very hip, good food. Go explore! :)",

I would have made this a 5 star review if it wasn't for the wait to get my food. The beau got his food very quickly but mines did not come out until 15 minutes later! Don't get me wrong, I do not mind waiting 15 minutes to get my food. I understand things have to be prepped and cooked but c'mon, you have to time things correctly. You can NOT just have one person eating while the other stares for 15 minutes.   Other than that the food was amazing!  5 Spice Hen w/ Tomato Rice -- The spices used on the chicken was pretty good. Chicken could've been a little more moist but none the less pretty well cooked. It was also a good portion. It looked like a whole chicken (or should I say hen) was used. It was about $13, which was is a good price for the portion.   Oxtail Fries-- This was part of their specials & not on the menu. It was fries with oxtail, gravy, chopped green onions, and an over easy egg on top. The flavors really burst in your mouth. It was very unique. Honestly, I thought it was going to be like Carne Asada Fries but it had no resemble to it at all! Very good. That was about $9! I thought it was going to be more expensive!   Vietnamese Donkey-- This is their touch of Moscow Mules. & we all know I order that everywhere I go. This one was a lot sweeter than most moscow mules I've tasted. They used a Lycee alcohol and you can defiantly taste it. It even comes out with an actual Lycee fruit that I appreciated very much. This was $12, which I thought was on the pricer side but hey, its alcohol!   Besides my rant in the beginning of the review.. service was pretty decent. Our waiter was very informative when asked questions about the menu. It seemed that he knew I was getting upset about the long wait for my food so I felt he was avoiding my eye contact but other than that.. SEE YOU AGAIN SOON DISTRICT ONE!",

I did wish that there was some more in the mix though. It only came with the rice noodles, broccoli, and carrots. I was hoping for some tofu or something that made the pho more complete.

The decor/vibe was a nice surprise and though it looks smaller from the outside, there are plenty of tables and a decent sized bar. They could turn the music down a bit so people could hear each other better though.  The issue was with some of the waitstaff and time for meals to come. Twice they poured water in my club soda and completely forgot to bring the drinks ordered by the others at the table. They brought my food (which was very good) and the other person w/us waited almost 15 minutes for his meal.  The staff seemed absent-minded and scattered.  Nonetheless, the place has a good atmosphere and I may have just been there on an \"off day\".  I'll go back and see if I have a better experience.",

I ordered Bun Bo hue since it my favorite noodle. I also ordered Vietnamese coffee since I was tired from the long drive to Vegas. The coffee was good that it help me stay wide awake the whole day lol. While the girls all ordered their District famous ox tail pho,  I had to be the \"Unique\" out of the group lol.  The portions of the bun bo hue and pho was big. It was very good. I got to taste of some of pho since my friend shared with me. I was impress with their pho so next time I will order the Ox tail Pho or maybe the lobster pho. The servers were very attentive and checked on us often . They refills our water often.

    "text": "I heard about this place from a coworker of mine that claimed it had the best and most authentic Vietnamese food in the Las Vegas area. I knew I had to try it after hearing him talk so highly of it. Without looking at any of the pictures, I came here on a whim.  Immediately seeing the doors, I could already tell this was going to be far from authentic. It has the American western spin and style on the decor, the the atmosphere, and the food itself. There was not a speck of Vietnamese on the menu. Everything was in English. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing. I was just expecting full blown Vietnam when he told me authentic.  My gf and I ordered the oxtail fries, pho Bo vien, and I got the steak and eggs.  The oxtail fries came out at the same time as my steak and eggs, leaving no gap between appetizer and entree.  The oxtail fries were a 1/10 for me. The attempt to blend fries with a soupy oxtail gravy broth results in a soggy mess of flavors that do not complement each other. It actually became worse as I ate more and more. Initially I thought it would garner a 3/10 but as I said the flavors were fighting each other in my mouth, and maybe even my stomach.  My entree was the steak and eggs but should be called steak and egg. The shaky beef was delicious and pretty amazing. The rice itself was bland in my opinion but it might have been part of the experience to emphasize the shaky beef flavoring.  My girlfriend got the pho meatballs and told me they were between a four and a six. So I'll say five.  All in all this meal was mediocre for way too much. And I still have the aftertaste of the oxtail fries in my mouth hours later.",

    "text": "Been here a few times when I visit Vegas. Came in oct 4 with my old lady for an early dinner at 5pm. She's never tried it, but heard about the lobster pho. We got the half portion along with the carpaccio, papaya salad, ox fries, and the oysters. The oysters were pretty fresh. My old lady thought the papaya salad and carpaccio were salty, I thought it was good. I guess my tolerance is higher. The pho, however, was super salty. We both agreed the pho was very salty. She drank 3 cups of iced water, I had 4 myself.  I asked the waitress if We could have some hot water, broth, or something bland to add to the pho because it was so salty. The waitress agreed and 10 mins later some pho broth came out. We tasted the broth before adding to the lobster pho. We both could not believe it. The broth was just as salty. I took a few more sips, because I thought my taste buds were off. I drank more water waited and tried again. It was really salty. So we ate the meats in the pho (which were pretty good, by the way). The waitress came back and asked us how everything was, I told her the broth she gave was just as salty. We only took a few sips of the hot broth. She took it away and apologized.  When the bill came, I was shocked to see they have added 3$ to our bill for the extra broth. I told the waitress I don't mid paying for the Lobster pho, but told her I thought it wasn't fair to charge me for the side of broth. She apologized and removed it.  Summary: the waitress was respectful. She was never rude. Maybe my communication was off? I would say the service is good on behalf of the waitress, but why did any body not ask us about the broth or lobster or why we thought the pho was salty? They never offered to fix it period. So my conclusion is the management wasn't present, was not aware, or doesn't care. It's a shame because the other dishes were pretty decent. My old lady didn't like the papaya salad because that's not what she was used to, but I thought it was great.",

I heard great things about District One from my roommate who recommended their pho and carpaccio. I didn't know about carpaccio at a non-Italian restaurant, so we passed on that, but we got a side of egg rolls and shared a ox bone soup with a side of extra noodles. A pho + side of noodles is plenty enough food for two! My only disappointment was that I expected the soup broth to be milkier since it was \"ox bone\" soup (I'm familiar with this type of soup being boiled for hoursssss), but it just felt like regular pho soup with boiled ox bone meat put into the soup. The meat wasn't melting off the bone like I expected it to, but still a great serving of pho nonetheless. Will definitely come back when visiting Vegas along with all the other great eats in Chinatown!",

The wings had a nice kick to them and tasted incredible. Might of been just a little to much food but we managed. No room for dessert though.  They have a nice beer and cocktail selection and an attentive staff. I liked the multiple wash basins outside the entrance to the bathrooms to allow for a quick clean up before but especially after eating, nice touch.  Looking forward to returning.",

I had to re-evaluate if I still wanted to order this, so I asked them that will the broth be as sweet as if it was made with live lobster. Our server answered yes. So, I went on and ordered it.  IT WAS NOT WORTH IT! $49 for pho made with frozen lobster. It was tasteless and the noodles itself was soggy. I will not recommend ordering this.

Staff was super cool about it.   Interior is trendy, the food is like homestyle Asian/Vietnamese fusion, service was great, everyone had a great time.   Favorite dishes -    - Big Bone Soup - $15 (4/5) - Strait up #foodporn since you get this huuuuge crazy looking bowl full of marrow bones in this pho type broth. Kinda have to dig for the meat but I thought it was fun to eat.

Good - Chicken wings with the garlic and serrano peppers. $8. Always a hit - Belly buns $8 - pork belly bao's with jalapeno, cilantro, and peanut. Classic combo, they could get a little creative here and borrow from the Chairman Bao truck.  - Grilled whole squid - huge.  - Five spice roasted cornish game hen $13 - overcooked and little skimpy with meat.  - Hue style beef noodle soup $10 - cha, pork blood cubes, the broth wasn't as deep as I've had. More fusion style.   I'd come back. I'll try their lobster pho next.",

It has the seafood/crab shack feeling, with wood top tables with an urban feel.   After being seated, TK gave us the rundown of what the specials of the day was. Quite a few interesting choices, but eventually went with the Dungen. Very friendly staff, well except for one young female who collected our food to pack to go. She seemed irritated, mad, frustrated. Whatever it was, lucky it came at the end of the meal, cause we were quite happy with the food. Where's the smile at girl!?   What ordered: Ox tail fries Spring rolls Whole Dungeness special with garlic noodles. Pho Oxtail Pho Tai Nam Pho Tom  Record time food service. From live to stirfried, the dungeness came out in a fairly quick and reasonable time limit. Everyone's food came all together and presented very well. Too bad they didn't have the bone maroc soup, but that just gives us a reason why we should be back.   There is a full bar for those who want to have a drink with their meal. The atmosphere is casual and inviting. The parking gets crowded because of competing businesses, but not scarce.   Definitely will come back. Hopefully by then, their busser/server will have a smile then. Otherwise check out TK and the rest of the staff at District One.",

    "text": "Had the lobster pho last time and even though it tasted pretty good it wasn't worth the $50 in Vegas.   Ordered the shrimp pho, grilled squid, pork belly clay pot and fresh coconut water.   Pork belly was braised so well and flavorful, delicious! Grilled squid was a good snack with a nice dipping sauce on the side and the shrimp pho was what I need from the long week. Clear broth yet so tasty with everything added in, I like how much lime they gave. Shrimps were the prepackaged supermarket shrimps though. Still good! Gave like 10 shrimps :) .   Coconut water was great! Hydrate yourself in that 116 degree weather. Will come back on my next visit to Vegas!",

After a while we had to call someones attention. He said he only serve drinks but he will call our server. We got water... I could see three servers around but another 8 minutes passed and we left. Total of 15 minutes, 5 tables occupied 6-7 servers/ drink servers around. Am I wrong here?",

Non traditional Vietnamese restaurant so don't expect some of the usual dishes like banh xeo, special pho, chao tom, etc.  The oxtail pho, fried pork buns, beef tartar never disappoint.  Best green mango salad ever; perfectly flavored, with octopus (if it's available)!   Wish it's a regular on the menu and not a special item!  Delish sea snails, a must try; another perfectly prepared dish served in a lemon grass broth with ginger prepared fish sauce: the flavor of the snails really come through.",

I weren't familiar with the area because I was from California. When getting to the right spot looking from the outside it wasn't the greatest place to be at because it was outside Las Vegas strip, but walking in the restaurant was something different. I love there decoration. And I full bar! A plus for me in my book. Never seen a pho restaurant that had a bar. Going back to my Bowl of Lobster! I order the pho lobster even though they had some other choice I wanted to try but I came here for lobster so I had to try that first. Warning the lobster pho had a market price. So ask for the price before ordering! When I recently went there I guess it was $50 a bowl which was outrageous. But I had to just try it out. When they brought it out the plating was really nice. They actually peel the lobster before hand for you and lay it back out. Wow.. Less work for me so I can enjoy my food. The broth was really good, overall the whole dish was really good but it wasn't worth what I was paying. Will be back next time if I come back to LV! A must try place if your traveling to Vegas or your living there..",

The sauce with the egg rolls was a traditional sweet dipping sauce.  We had the house oysters (6) which were recommended by our server and they were out of this world.  I ordered the whole fish and she ordered the lobster pho, both were exceptional.  The lobster pho was amazing with the broth perfectly seasoned and the lobster amazingly fresh.  My fish was wonderful, the sweet and sour sauce was vastly improved by a large amount of garlic and the meat was crunchy and flavorful.  We had the bok choy as a side and it was perfectly prepared.

    "text": "I love the food here but the one favorite dish I always order is the big bone soup. It's so amazing to eat all the marrow and cartilage in delicious beef pho broth. The best part is that they do it tableside. It is perfect for two people to share and you can add a side of pho noodles. It's the best thing on the menu for everyone that I have brought to try.  The beef carpaccio is also amazing. The truffle oil and peanuts on top provide a nice dressing and it's light and fresh. It's a must order.  The other favorite is the grilled whole squid. The dipping sauce is a spicy aioli which is cool and sharp.  The garlic noodles are also good but I would always say remind them more al dente as sometimes it is too mushy for my taste.  I know a lot of other reviewers like the pork belly buns but I didn't like the sauce and would pass. I am more of a purist where I don't like sauce but that is personal preference.  My hubs loves their lobster pho with egg noodles. The lobster comes pre cracked so you can eat it easily without being messy. It is his favorite cheat meal.  The only disappointment is the big bone broth. We have called to reserve but have shown up and it is not available. Or called to see if they even have it available and were told yes of course and shown up and our waitress has said they were already out for the day.  Today, on our honeymoon in Vegas there was no bone broth. Instead we settled for the oxtail pho with no noodles. I thought they would give us 4 oxtails to share since we went sans noodles but we got 3 tiny pieces, how are two people supposed to share that esp after expecting a hearty bone broth soup? Sad face. Hopefully next time or take it off the regular menu!",

I was expecting it to just be mediocre. The flavors are very similar to the traditional Vietnamese cuisine you would expect.   The reason I gave it four stars is my entree the 'double down' I got it with short ribs, was very burnt and all of one side was completely black I could barely taste the meat. I would recommend sticking with the Noodles.   However some delicious dishes I like are:  The Spicy Hue Noodle soup: a bit spicy but very delicious  The Mekong River Noodle soup: very similar to traditional Vietnamese soup   The Pho Tai Rib eye: the meat is much better quality than regular pho stores",

    "text": "If you're coming for the bone marrow pho, come earlier rather than later. Had one person in my party disappointed to find out they ran out at 2:30pm. Then he finds out his second good choice of deep fried crab was no longer on the menu, so caution!  We had a party of 10. We thought appetizers took a few minutes too long to come out. The oysters on the specials of the day menu were 3.50 each and they were very small. I thought they were good, but I would rather not have the caviar texture on it. The thinly sliced meat with oil was interesting. It was good, but food at room temperature doesn't really appeal to me. Most of the family got the oxtail soup since the bone marrow pho was sold out. They thought it was good, the noodles are thicker than we are used to.   The most negative part of our experience was that our food came out at very different times. Half of the party who ordered rice dishes ended up finishing eating as the soups made their way out. We came here to eat together not watch each other eat. That's a little mean, but it really did suck.   Other than that, the food that we did get to order was decent. Buy personally, I'm not a fan of Asian fusion. I like my Asian food as is. (: (for example, their papaya salad is not how I like my Thai papaya salad :(.....)   But I would still give it another chance to try their bone marrow pho and lobster pho!   Enjoy (;",

We were a big group, 7 of us, but they were able to sit us down immediately. We started with apps, which were amazing. If you're a drinker I would recommend trying the Vietnamese Donkey, their version of a Russian Mule. The twist was fantastic, I ordered a few. For dinner I had the king crab which was just enough to satisfy my hunger without making me too full.   When I go back I will absolutely try the lobster pho - a friend of mine ordered it and said it was out of this world. I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants but have never seen anything like that. Very impressive.   The ambience was incredible, very cool and laid back. Music was on point. If I lived in Vegas we would be regulars. When I go back to Vegas it will be the first place I dine at.

I'm Vietnamese, so I like to think of myself as half expert, half hater when it comes to Vietnamese food. My parents rarely took us out to eat growing up and when they did, they were always complaining about how nothing tasted as good as my mom's home cooking. Well, that was largely True... until I came to District One.  The food tastes as good as my mom's, but with much fancier ingredients! I can't make a trip out to Vegas without stopping here for the oxtail fried rice, oysters, or coconut ice cream. Most recently, we tried the black pepper lobster and it's the best Chinese lobster I've had outside of So Cal. Everyone I've sent or brought here (including my hater ass brother, we have it in our blood) vouches for this place. If I ever bring my mom, I'll be sure to update this review.",

Me and my wife ordered the 5 spice Cornish hen which we shared and a pandan creme brulee for dessert. The Cornish hen was served with tomatoe fried rice which was plenty for two people and the creme brulee was on point, because the sugar shattered when tapped with A spoon which means it was done properly. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it took FOREVER just to get our check, and it wasn't even busy. Overall service was pretty good and food was really good. I'll definitely be back",

    "text": "Me and the bf have been wanting to try this place for a while now and take the fam here, so I thought why not try it out first before bringing the whole clan over.   The atmosphere is really great when you walk in. Cute decoration and definitely brings a modern look to a Pho restaurant! Big plus because it doesn't terribly smell like Pho and have you worrying about your clothes when you walk out! They give you the option to either sit at a booth, open tables, bar or in a section somewhat closed off for tables.  The first time we came we asked for some recommendations and were encouraged to try out the lobster pho at $27.99 and yellowtail ahi tacos at $8.99, so we went ahead and did that. The tacos were soooo good. However, it was pricy for only only three small tacos. So I guess it really depends on what you are looking for: quality vs. quantity. The lobster pho was ok as far as taste (didn't wow me like I would expect) but the idea and look of the plate was cool. as far as the service, our waiters were great and very informational on the menu. I was a little distraught with. who I think, was the owner or manager. Both times I came to the restaurant, she spent more time trying to impress the \"big buyers\" and didn't stop to see how the other tables were doing even though those customers were right next to them. So that docks my service review a little. I also mentioned it to a friend of mine and she mentioned she noticed it the few times she went of the selective service. So for my review the first time around, I give the restaurant a 3 for food and 4 for service!  My second time later that week I brought my family and ordered the oxtail soup and hue spicy beef noodle soup for me and the BF. Defffff redeemed themselves this second time around. I loved both soups and the oxtail was so soft it basically just came off the bone easily (I'm sorry no pictures for the second time around tho!). The service was all around the same as the first - good waiters, manager tended or paid notice only to other higher paying customers. But all in all, second time rating is a 5 for food and 4 for service!  Definitely coming back again and again... But It won't be for the lobster pho! Love this place!",

    "text": "I'm a recent Las Vegas transplant and I was looking for a good place for Pho. I came to Yelp since I'm not familiar with restaurants yet and saw all the good reviews and comments about District One, so I decided to try this place. I was greeted warmly and was given the option of booth, table or bar since it was just myself. The waitress asked if I wanted to see the specials and took my drink order. The specials were actually on a small chalkboard which she kept propt up on the seat at the next table for me.  Since I did come for Pho, I got the Pho Tai (ribeye) and the Surf Clams which were a daily special.  The Pho came out first, and in a much larger bowl than I've had in the past. You do get your money's worth for 7.99! No limes available, but the lemon gave it its own interesting flavor. I've only known Pho from the East Coast, and it pales in comparison to this bowl of heaven. Even the noodles were far better. The surf clam came out on its shell, with some garnishes and hot sauce. I'm not certain of the spice because I didn't ask, but it certainly packs a whallop. If you do not deal with spicy foods, I would suggest avoiding this (unfortunately.)  During dinner, three people came over to help. I'm not sure if it's an LV thing or not, but it felt like there isn't one person assigned to a table but rather everyone helps out. That's why I have the place 5 instead of just 4 stars. You help each other out, you help the customer out. Cheers.",

From what I heard this place is owned or co-owned by my friend's cousin Nelson (Hi Nelson)..correct me if I'm wrong...which is a cool little addition to have found out.  The layout of the place reminds me of Boiling Crab back home, but the decor is very modern while the ambiance is relaxing/casual.  Food wise we tried the tacos which were a hit for everyone and the pork belly buns that were also bomb dot com.  My friend had the rice dish with pork belly and kind of wished that it was larger portion, but luckily his brother ordered pho so that compensated for him not being full.  Other than that we all ordered the oxtail pho and no one had any complaints about it not fulfilling their expectations.  Service was good in terms of refilling water and taking our orders, but it took a while for them to grab our bill so we had to walk up to the front cashier and wait for someone to notice us.  Other than that minor minor hindrance, the visit itself was worth the drive and this has become a new addition to my must-go's whenever I'm in town.",

Beyond the ubiquitous  Vietnamese spring roll, my knowledge of Vietnamese cuisine is extremely lacking to nil. I was in the mood for some type of Asian noodle dish, so why not try this spot.   D.O. is a large eatery which looks to be a cross between an industrial warehouse style cantina bar (think lots of metal siding) with hints of decor from a  pier-side restaurant. There are lots of booths and bench style tables. Since we were a large party of 11, three large tables were connected  together on their slightly raised platform. Our server did a nice job taking our orders and getting the meals to us in a prompt manner.   Besides Vietnamese cuisine or fusion, D.O. has dishes inspired from the other three heavyweights of Asian cuisine (China, Japan & Thailand). This place looks like it has a happening bar scene too. There is a long white granite top bar which is the focal point at the rear of the restaurant.   My family seemed to really enjoy their meals. This is my eldest sister's fav place when she hungers for Vietnamese food. As for me, I ordered up the spring roll appetizer for starters. The spring roll tasted fresh and filled with chicken, pork, lettuce, peanut sauce & vermicelli. I dab a little bit of chili sauce on the vegetable roll to give it a kick.  For my entree, I enjoyed the unique crispy bird's nest soup. The dish was of generous proportion. The dish contained fish balls, whole shrimp, and chicken. I nixed the beef off my dish. The veggies added texture and color to the plate. I sprinkle chili sauce to give it a kick. Warning: If you have a below average appetite; this dish is not for you. You may have to bring a friend to share this dish.   I recommend this place if you like Asian cuisine.",

    "text": "I finally got around to experiencing one of the most talked about pho spots in Vegas.  Initially when I first discovered District One through Instagram, I thought they were just riding the gimmicky foodie wave with their lobster pho. I can't speak for their lobster because I didn't order it. However, this review is based on what I *did* order and it was easily some of the best pho I've eaten.  For starters, the pho here is pretty expensive. Pho itself is pretty cheap to make, meat aside. It is, however, a very time consuming process to produce quality broth that's deep in flavor and comforting throughout the entire meal. Thankfully District One does just that and while it may not justify paying $16 for a bowl of pho, it doesn't hurt treating yourself to a quality bowl of pho every now and then.  I ordered their oxtail pho which ran me $16. It was a hearty portion with some very tender and delicious oxtail. The noodles were boiled perfectly and the broth was rich in flavor.  I've steered away from adding lime and sriracha to my pho these days, as I want to enjoy what the dish is naturally supposed to be. Usually at average pho spots, I find myself needing to add some excitement halfway through my meal, and that's where the sriracha and lime comes in. This wasn't the case with District One. In fact, I basically forgot about doing all that extra stuff because it was so good. I was too busy trying to get every scrap of meat off the oxtail.  I left District One feeling very satisfied with my meal. The only downside was that we didn't get basil or culantro. Other than that, everything was pretty much spot on. I'm looking forward to trying a lot of the other items they have to offer next time I'm around.",

The spicy hue noodle was pretty spicy for me, but my BF' family is from Hue so they can eat all kinds of spicy! They were very content with their spicy hue noodle. The beef bone broth was massive and satisfying! The meat and cartilage on the bones were grade A! I also like the pork belly fried buns.   Service was fast and on point!

I was really really really looking forward to my coconut ice cream with toasted peanuts--the waiter joked that they were out, and then came back and said they were *really* out.  Sad times.  We got the oxtail fries as an appetizer, really rich.. really good.  It comes with an egg on top as well.  I also got the surf and turf--this is the perfect amount of beef and seafood and noodles that isn't \"too much\" food or \"too little.\"  I also tried my friend's sea shells in the lemongrass/thai broth--yum!  A little spicy so I didn't have much broth, but definitely delish.  BF got the oxtail soup.. but one of his last pieces was a big piece of oxtail and the oxtail was not cooked enough.  The meat was chewy and would not come off the bone, he couldn't bite gnaw or pull it off with a fork.  This was not cooked long enough so I told him to give up and just ditch it... this was disappointing.  This is one of my friend's fave spots so we will probably be back again for pho.. but maybe avoid the oxtail soup next time and stick to the surf and turf.. and hopefully they'll redeem themselves and have my coconut ice cream next time!",

A party of 6 left 5 mins later, tables clean and empty. We are now waiting for 20 mins, so I asked the host when will be seated and it's that our table? She said no, that table is reserved and we'll have to wait another 20 mins. Umm what now?? So, I asked if we could be seated at the empty tables on the stage. She said No, that's the Red Zone. No one is to be seated there. Really WTF!!  Hesitated, she went and talked to the manager and 30 mins later we were seated.",

    "text": "District one, meaning \"Quan 1\" in Vietnamese. District 1 is the first district in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam or otherwise known as \"Saigon City, Vietnam.\" District 1 is an affluent part of the city and it is where all the tourists are. I didn't recognize this until I sat down and look at the menu realizing that it is a Vietnamese restaurant naming it after a district in Saigon.   Prices are definitely high! Not worth it, if you are a tourist! Service was great as they are attentive but then they are too busy counting money to see that you are waving for the check!  Bo Luc Lac: About $15-$16. It was way salty. I did not like it. It should be served with White Rice, not with \"Soi\" kind of rice, which is a tougher texter and requires more chewing. The Beef should be cut into nice square cubes. The other pieces of the beef looked too shredded and were as if it is the leftovers. The juice sauce was way too salty for me. They should drain it out instead of including it on the plate. The eggs were yummy. No, I do not think it was worth $15-$16. Way overpriced.   Shredded Chicken Salad: About $12. The shredded pieces of chicken are way too large. For this dish, it needs to be thin out. It definitely was the lazy shredding or this is the way they had always served it. But it should be thinly shredded. Not as much cabbage, there should be more cabbage in proportion with the fish sauce.   Fried Rice Ox Tail: About $15-$16. This is actually decent as it is very buttery and included a decent amount of oxtail meat.   It is definitely expected as there are not a lot of competitions here for Vietnamese restaurants, they are able to manipulate the prices as they like. In Orange County, $12 could get us duck salad with a large bowl of soup with bamboo shoots.   When I eat here, I miss Orange County due to the variety and the prices. I love the booths, they are very long and a wide that accommodates large groups. Plenty of T.V.s as it is a bar atmosphere. The decorations remind me of a seafood restaurant with its bare minimal on the ceiling and the wooden fixtures.   We are not Las Vegas locals, perhaps this is the most legit eatery around and it attracts a lot of people. Especially the large family. Or maybe just the lack of Vietnamese restaurants around this area.   We did not drive here, therefore no comment on the parking spaces. And I did not use their bathroom so no comment.",

    "text": "Okay so I decided on this place for date night after searching for 'ox tail' (random but serious craving). I was no joke going to order the Ox Tail Fries, Ox Tail Fried Rice and Oxtail Pho but my boyfriend told me to simmer down.   We decided on the Serrano Wings, Ribeye Pho, and drumroll please Oxtail Fried Rice.   First impression : the atmosphere is fun and I totally loved that they were playing jams from 2005-2008. Love knowing every single word to the music playing. The service was really good and everyone was very friendly but not overly fake and annoying. Very lively place!   Onto the food:   Serrano Wings were kick ass good! They were crispy and the serranos were easy to avoid if you don't like fire burning heat.   Here's where it gets bad:   Rib Eye Pho was mediocre. The broth was pretty bland and underdeveloped. I don't like pouring globs of Siracha and Hoisin sauce into my pho because I actually want to enjoy the broths flavor but I mean I HAD to add something to this one. Really disappointing. Every single other place in town that I've had pho at has been better than this place.   The oxtail fried rice: oh man! I really really really wanted to LOVE this but it wasn't good!!! Huge NO from me. I was expecting chunks of oxtail in it but I swear there were only the tiniest slivers of meat in it. So bizarre! It was super greasy too. I felt absolutely ROBBED paying $16 dollars for greasy ass fried rice with a dusting of ox tail meat on it. How dare you District One????  So we totally won't be back to this place. 2 stars for the wings and sweet playlist.",

The food is pretty good compared to their sister restaurants Pho So 1 and the Viet Noodle Bar. It's cleaner, the fusion adds more kick and the customer service is better. But there was one time I got the Big Bone Soup; it was tasty but there was so much meat I had to take a big bone home lol. Besides the flavorful food, the parking can be a hassle as it fills up by 6pm. Other than that, it's a perfect spot for a friends gathering, a quick drink (they have a bar) or if you like Vietnamese food with a spin/kick. On a side note, I personally don't like their happy hour because the prices are kind of high considering what you get.",

The soup comes with massive chunks of bone marrow and a tasty, flavourful broth. You have to add noodles to it but we just had the soup itself and it was plenty. The whole squid is at an unbelievable price - you get the entire squid for under 15$ and it's charred to perfection. The garlic noodles were tasty too, and you have the options to add protein to it but we were so stuffed with the bone marrow that we were proteined-out!   I didn't have much of the iced coffee but my boyfriend, who gets it very often, says it's pretty authentic and strong.",

    "text": "My friends and I were craving pho and we came upon this place. What mostly drew our eye was  the lobster pho, but when we got there and found out that it was $35 for half lobster and half beef, we decided to pass.. we just ended up getting the huge bone marrow pho which was also pricey ($17) I think. And chicken pho.   The bone marrow was huge! The largest bone marrow I've had, but I only thought that the bone marrow pho was just OK. It wasn't as amazing as I hoped it to be. The chicken pho wasn't my favorite either. I feel like I should have stuck with beef ball or regular pho. The chicken pho did not taste like chicken broth and the chicken pieces weren't very tender or flavorful. I also felt like the broth was a bit oily. But overall, it did its job since we were craving pho and desperately needed it after a night of drinking. Kinda sad that I didn't get to try the lobster pho, but it is unfortunately a bit too pricey for me to try.",

For the cost and quality it didn't hit the a lot for me . I would recommend you come here to try the food as that was jut my opinion and I want this business to do well .

I finally got to try the lobster pho but the market price was 79$ for a bowl of lobster pho, for that price, I'm not sure if it was worth it. But definitely worth the experience and the pictures.  Everything else on the menu is pretty good too. Besides the seafood, the price for this place is more than reasonable and the whole ambiance is hip and trendy. I also love all the TVs playing live sports.",

For the price, I was expecting a bigger portion. This is definitely the most expensive pho I've ever gotten and it just didn't live up to expectations. The oxtail was pretty good because it was tender though, but other than that I'm not impressed. We also got the pork buns, which were pretty good, but it needs some caramelization or something to contrast the texture. It was just all soft and I got tired of eating it after one. We probably won't be back.",

Came with a party of 4 on a Thursday night (we had a reservation). It wasn't too busy when we got there, maybe like 15 people or so inside.   We ordered 2 lobster phos, an oxtail pho and a dozen oysters (think they were Blue Point). When the oysters came out, we actually asked our waitress to replace one of em' because it looked like someone picked at it; was super flat n not plump. Normally we don't make a huge deal about stuff like that but it looked weird lol. Anyway, they tasted alright; feel like I've had fresher tasting ones before. The pho... it totally made up for it tho! I got to try the broth from both the oxtail and lobster phos. They were really flavorful and the oxtail meat was tender. With seafood, it's always at market price so it was like $50! Pretty pricey bowls of pho but it's cool to try something new.",

The black pepper lobster noodle I originally thought it was going to be in a pho bowl like the whole lobster pho but with more flavor, so initially I was disappointed but the way it came it was still great and the matcha thai tea have been one of my favorite drinks as of late since I first discovered it at a Thai restaurant in Elk Grove, CA a must try when in Vegas",

We didn't really do our usual his/hers order, but shared everything:  We ordered: - CRISPY EGG ROLLS: Four fried eggrolls cooked to perfection served with large lettuce leaves with all the fixins like pickled carrot and mint leaves. Wrap an eggroll with the lettuce, sprinkle some of the garish and dip in the side sauce. The perfect appetizer! - THE ORIGINAL WHOLE MAINE LOBSTER PHO: This is listed as market price and was about 50$, but so worth it if you are a lobster lover! A generous 1.5 lbs whole maine lobster in a yummy lobster pho broth with rice noodles. A foodie must try! - CRISPY BIRD'S NEST NOODLE: Chicken, beef, shrimp, fishballs and assorted vegetables on top of a full plate bed of crispy noodles, softened by a delicious gravy. This was so good and filling, and only 14.99!  Everything was not only presented well, but was extremely full of flavor. We left full and satisfied for sure! Service was good as well... And would we return again? Oh, absolutely!   Maybe the only downfall was we waited for seating for a good 20 minutes despite there being a lot of seating. I originally asked if a booth was available and the hostess told me she would let me know. 5 minutes later she asked if we still wanted to wait for a booth or were okay with a table, as there still were none. I said, \"Oh okay, a table is fine!\" She comes back another 15 minutes later and asks us the same question. -___-",

I finally gave district one a try since all my friends always eat here and always recommend this place but everything went wrong the first time i went here.  I ordered pork belly with white rice and green tea thai tea and water.  The water arrived placed on a plastic cup, the moment i took a sip of the water i saw a long hair from the plastic cup going inside my water. I did not call my server cause i don't really wanna cause any attention to me its just water.  Food arrived placed on a bowl , pork belly with soup. To me the dish is too plain nothing special. (Sorry)  Halfway done eating the pork belly another thing pop out , another hair. (As seen on the picture).  This time I immediately called my server. She apologized  and asked me if i wanted new pork belly. (I refused because at this time i already lost my appetite.    She even gave me free ice cream and took out the thai tea off my bill. (Still had to pay for the pork belly)  I feel like the management needs to do something about their employees appearance/uniform. Girls need to be in a bun not flying around.",

I thought it would be very \"fusion\" from the vibe and decor is the restaurant but it def exceeded my expectations. Came here as our last meal of my friends bach party before heading back to LA. All together we ordered different pho bowls and fried rice. I got their oxtail pho and wow... soup was so clean and not too oily, meat was high quality. It was really good. No really. Their fried rice was simple but very tasty and went perfect with the pho broth. Definitely will be back next time to try their lobster pho and other dishes.   Service was really good too.

In addition, the wings and the house oysters are always a must. If you still have room, you must try their coconut ice cream. It comes with a very light coconut ice cream in half of a coconut with spoon coconut at the bottom. It is so Delish! I'll be back again and again.",

Had the lobster pho, could use more of a seafood kick to it but lobster really isn't too fishy which is understandable. The bone marrow soup was my favorite especially with a hangover.

I understand that everybody has different taste pallets and that's why I want to go back and order something different. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff are very nice.  I ordered the Garlic Serrano Wings and a Viet Michelada. The wings had no flavor or spice and tasted like regular fried chicken. The Viet michelada wasn't that bad, it just kind of tasted like they added fish sauce to it, which might be the \"Viet\" way but I didn't really like it. My friends ordered Pho (which I do want to go back and try) and my other friend ordered steak and eggs with rice. I didn't try either of their meals but they both looked like they tasted better than the wings. Also, I did get to try the Mango Spritzer and that was really good, it's sweet with a hint of tartness to it, sort of like lemonade. I also got to try the Matcha Thai Tea and that was good as well. Not too much matcha with the perfect ratios of each flavor.  Like I said, I am willing to go back to try this place again because everybody was very welcoming and the other plates of food looked very appetizing!",

My personal favorite was the oxtail fried rice & oxtail fries. It was so tasty and yummy. Every bite was delicious. I was so full from dinner I didn't get to try any deserts :(  I really like the vibe in here. It's a great place for a first date, family dinner or just to come and have a drink at the bar.   The prices are very reasonable and customer services was great.    Tips:  *Parking is tough on the weekends because this shopping center is full of great stores.  *Pretty chilly in here so bring a light sweater.",

Traditional Asian dishes with a twist... here's what we had on our table (for 3 girls) Garlic Serrano Wings - oh my word. Crispy & garlicky and just the right amount of spice. This one is delicious. Coconut Pork Belly - comes with an egg, rice, and some pickled veggies. There was about 3 pork belly cubes per order, this one was good but reminded me of just your regular adobo. Garlic noodles (added shrimp) - YES! Chowed this down in less than 5 minutes. Oxtail Fried Rice - GET THIS! They don't skimp on the oxtail meat, so flavorful, and it's a huge serving, they top it off with an egg and everything is perfection. The Big Bone Soup - huge bones with bone marrow in a pho broth, so overwhelming in size, but so comforting and good.   Customer service is on point. The workers are helpful and happy. I really like the vibe here. The restaurant is clean, the food is served at a timely manner. It's worth the wait definitely.",

Came here for Sunday lunch around 1:30 p.m. Place was packed but our wait wasn't that long, a little less than 15 minutes. We got seated in one of the large booths by the window. Since it was 105 deg outside, we weren't in the mood for pho. Instead, we tried two of their rice dishes - the rice combo platter that came with short ribs, fried egg & Chinese sausage and the pork belly with boiled egg & pickled veggies. Both were good but nothing special. We also had the coconut ice cream for dessert, which was served in a coconut shell. You can scoop up pieces of coconut and mix it with the ice cream...delish! Service was excellent, and we'll definitely come back here on our next trip to LV...and maybe try one of their pho.",

After dining here a few times within the past couple months, I am still eager to try more from their menu.   Their modernized southeast asian cuisine has something almost anyone can enjoy. Every dish I've tried was delicious.   They do have a weekly menu along with daily specials.   must try: oxtail fried rice, pork belly buns ( fried), viet beef carpaccio  Can't forget the staff, each visit was served with an attentive and informative waiter. They knew the menu so well and even helped pack up my left over bone marrow soup.   Great job  District one!",

Not only was it excellent quality but they gave you a good amount unlike a lot of places that are stingy.  Also got the Matcha Thai green tea which was delicious and a nice alternative to most Thai tea's.  Will definitely be back with friends to try out some other things on the menu.",

They know how to do it right, right here at District One! So good! We were pleasantly impressed! We've been here, I would say, more than a couple dozen times in the past 2 years now? It is the perfect place for our Vietnamese comfort food!  My mom, who is Vietnamese, would make the family a dish she basically called \"PORK & EGG!\" Well, we didn't believe our eyes when we saw it on their menu, Thit Heo Kho. They put their spin on it, but we still fell in love with it. If that's not your thing, something like their amazing Garlic Noodles will do the trick for ya! You could ask them to stir fry it with anything really, veggies, chicken, you name it! Perfection!  I cannot say enough praise for their menu! They have so much that we love! And one thing that we love about District One is that it brings Hawaii to us! Yay! Oxtail Loco Moco! No description needed. Winnahz! Next on the oxtail bandwagon, Oxtail Fried Rice, Oxtail Fries, and of course, their Oxtail Pho! So go on and get yours! Must try! ALL! And while you're at it, and speaking of pho again...LOBSTER PHO! Whatttttthaaaapho??? This dish is an absolute memorable dish! A chef has done his job when a patron says his dish is \"memorable!\" That's their lobster pho! Last, but certainly not least, we had their Big Bone Soup! Massive! Inexplicably, massive! We were at odds trying to figure out how to dig into this dish! Thankfully, our \"looks like from Hawaii, but not from Hawaii\" server offered to carve it up table-side for us. The marrow. The soup. TO DIE FOR!  Oh, and yes, we mustn't forget the bar. Their cocktails (coconut mojito served in a coconut...mmm!) and beer selections are awesome! And there are TVs everywhere you sit so that you can never miss a game!  THANK YOU, KHAI & DISTRICT ONE! Your place rocks! And it's \"traditional Vietnamese mother - approved!\"",

The Serrano wings and garlic fries thought, not that good... No flavor and pretty plain but we got it during happy hour so at least the price was good.  Overall it was good. I'd probably only go for the pho because the broth was good and flavorful. Decently priced, especially during happy hour (5pm-7pm).",

The broth was okay, there wasn't a lot of noodles. Our waiter only took our order and didn't check on us at all. I didn't receive my bean sprouts or herbs until my friends received their pho. They ordered regular pho and theirs took about forty minutes to come out. We asked for several condiments during our meal and didn't receive it until asked for it again. Same thing happen with our check, we had to ask for it three times. If you're charging $50 for pho, please have better customer service.",

The pork belly was rich and tender but wasn't mind blowing. The lobster pho will hit you with sticker shock at ~$45 a bowl and isn't worth the price past the novelty.  They have great Ox tail pho however! The pho broth is likely the best in Vegas and the ingredients are fresh. I'd come back for the Ox tail pho alone.  This place is loud and rowdy.

Staff was in the middle of shift change but a were promptly switched over to another server who accommodated all of our needs. The atmosphere is really cool too. Decorated but not too cluttered.

I'm surprised they weren't busy, I expected it to be since the lot was pretty full... but I think it's always hard to find parking in this center, especially on weekend nights. People park everywhere and anywhere they can find space lol.   But anyway, we both ended up ordering the steak and eggs + oxtail fries. My steak and eggs ended up having heaps of onions rather than meat, but I suppose it was a good amount to get me full. They give you a lot of rice as well. The sauce they use seems like it's missing a little something, but I give this place props for trying.   The oxtail fries.... I've definitely had better, but my boyfriend seemed to like them since they \"weren't as sweet as others.\" Bachi Burger oxtail fries over District One oxtail fries any. day.  Service: Ok. Always had a full cup of water. That's always good. They check up on you often.   Pricing: Can't remember exact prices or totals, but it was around $46 something for two steak and eggs and the fries.  Just a side note: We didn't come for drinks, just for food, but overheard that they don't do happy hour on Fridays and Saturdays. Just a heads up.",

It was fairly empty when we arrived, and they were kind enough to let us sit at a larger table they had already cleaned for the night. The server was pleasant. All we really wanted was to try the bone marrow soup so we got 3 orders (for 5 ppl- 2 shared as it was 17.99 for 1) I also wanted to try the Oxtail fries so we got an order for the table.  Oxtail fries were great- loaded with an egg on top. Not a huge portion to share, but worked fine with us as there were a couple ppl who were not too hungry. If you're coming starving, I'd say it would be a sufficient appetizer for 3-4 ppl max.  Now, the best part was the bone marrow soup! One- it was HUGE. I quickly saw why it was 17.99 lol.  It was also a fun experience as we put on plastic gloves to really get all the marrow and such off the bones. A server came by to explain how & was really helpful and patient while teaching us how to get the most out of the soup. And YUMM it was amazing. My friend put some hoisin sauce in hers- but I loved it without just fine!   We had to box it to go, even though we shared it! Definitely worth it and will be back. If you're a fan of bone marrow, it will not disappoint!  They even bagged up the bones for me to take home to my doggies. Now my dogs will love it when we go too ;)",

I started with the stuffed jalapeno appetizer, which was just, well, kind of boring. Ground seasoned chicken on top of a cut-in-half grilled jalapeno with marinara sauce on top, super basic ya'll.  Next I had the oxtail fried rice and omg that stuff needs to come with a warning label, ox tail tastes like dirt. It's gamey AF and I like gamey, I'm down for lamb any of the week and I order birria tacos now and again, but ox tail is another level. It's also got that sinewy fat situation going on that just makes me gag. I know some folks love it, those who order the tendon at pho places for example, would love ox tail, but not I.   The shining star of the meal was the garlic noodles, they were perfect, dry and packed with flavor! I could eat 10 plates of it. I also really enjoyed my creamy green tea, so there were some hits amongst the misses and for that we go 3 stars.",

    "text": "Our party tried three appetizers and three entrees. We started with the Vietnamese Eggrolls, Fish Tacos, and Pork Belly Buns. These were all great tasting and beautifully prepared. The eggrolls were made with taro which gave it a unique taste. The fish tacos were our favorite. Although on the pricier side (approx. $10 for three baby tacos), the fish was fresh and tasted awesome with all its taco components. Pork belly was tender. Highly recommend.  Entrees were Mi Sate, Oxtail Pho, and Steak & Eggs.  Mi Sate was OK. We all agreed it was our least favorite dish. Very super thick, peanut flavored sauce-like broth with skinny egg noodles. There is a small spicy kick, but I couldn't get over the peanut butter thickness. Maybe it just had a bad night?  The real hero of the night was the Oxtail Pho. Leave it to District One to bring this one all the way home. Very aromatic, tender (and plentiful servings of) oxtail, a truly original tasting broth. Steak & Eggs was a good decision too. Steak was tender and expertly cooked, tomato rice was flavorful, overall good decision for anyone.   Impeccable guest service. We were diligently waited on by an attentive team and the food came out in a timely manner.  Overall good food, good ambiance. I will return with friends. Next time I'd really like to try their crawfish, lobster pho, 5 spice roasted hen, clay pot pork belly, and ca phe sua da! Awesome first impression! See you again, District one!",

    "text": "So here I am, at the soft opening of this new restaurant in town called District One. I'm here with 6 friends, so I didn't actually order ALL this food.   Decor: Love this Asian fusion restaurant. The decor is so cute. Especialy love the wallpaper and the \"let's nhau\" quote (vietnamese for let's party/drink) in the corner of the room. There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.  The CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.  Appetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.  Entree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.  Overall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool. It definitely feels like a family friendly environment. The waiters and waitresses come around and they always ask if everything is okay, and ready for refills.   Decor/Ambience: ***** Food: ****1/2  Service: ***** Drinks/Bar: TBD Overall: *****",

    "text": "Wanting a quick bite and decided to try something new. Never been here before and was wow'd the first time walking in. Never expect this contemporary decor when enjoying Asian/ Vietnamese food.  The wood all around the restaurant, multi leveled, and the beautiful 10-12 seat bar was warm and welcoming,  the aroma around the restaurant made us hungry, I was very excited to see what they had to offer.  After still talking about the decor, the server arrived promptly with menus and the specials of the day.  I was excited to try the entire menu, but settled on Pho Tai Nam. Yes, it's about 98 degrees that day and I decide I wanted hot soup, don't judge!! My friend ordered the Belly Buns. Although, I did not get a chance to try her dish, she couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  My soup was awesome, what was great about the dish was the after part.  After having Pho, at some places, I become growingly thirsty, not so much with District One's pho.  It was full of flavor, right about of onions, and did not have whatever component that makes you thirsty. Kuddos!!  I am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept. The food was definitely fusion, I mean where can you get fish tacos and chicken wings at any other Vietnamese restaurants.   I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients;  the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about.  Sure, this visit was brief, but I will definitely be back to try it out again and again.  Next time, I'll bring more reinforcements and will venture into the King Crab, Oysters, and the Down and Dirty options! Can't wait! Great job, great first impression!!",

To start, the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated, though nothing was as eye-catching as the sign outside.   We were seated immediately which was also nice, however, their happy hour options were pretty limited and to be honest the food and drinks overall seemed a bit overpriced. I had a red lantern cocktail which was pretty delicious, but kind of small given the price (I believe it was $13-$15). I ordered oxtail fried rice which was a little greasy, but good.  One of my four friends didn't receive his order until the rest of us had already finished our food, perhaps an hour or so after we were all seated. It pretty much ruined our experience there since they had cleaned off our table by the time my friend received his food, which he said was only decent (he ordered the claypot chicken).   Overall, the food and drinks were decent but definitely overpriced. I spent $35 dollars for one plate of fried rice and one drink, didn't seem worth it to me. Service wasn't terrible but the food arrived very late. We would probably not eat here again for these reasons.",

Once at 1:30am in the morning and again during regular lunch hours. Love that its unlike most Viet restaurants where you just eat and leave. Here you can linger. Both visits food was solid.   Eats: - lobster pho: $29.99 for a approx. 1.5lbs of fresh lobster in a bowl/platter of pho. This is a steal! - bone marrow soup: flintstone-size bones in broth. More than one person can eat so share! - steak and eggs: hubby gulped this down before i could taste but looked yummy - beef carpaccio: awesome flavor and texture. Eat! - scallop sashimi: fresh and amazing flavor served w/ crunchy scallop skin. Woah! - pho tai rib eye: awesome broth really developed.  - rice combo platter w/ pork chop, short ribs, and chinese sausage w/ kimchi and fried egg. Loved the kimchi variant and that my egg oozed yolk  Aside from the food, whats best about this place is that you can lounge since its set up to rival any sports bar w/ comfortable seating and enough tvs to watch all the games at once. Take your sports bar loving hubby!",

Music is good and decor is pretty modern.   We tried the Oxtail Pho, Steak and Eggs, and Braised Pork Belly. I love oxtail with a passion so you really can't go wrong with me when oxtail is on the menu. It fell off the bones and they were gracious with the amount of meat they had in the pho. They put a little spin on the steak and eggs and added tomato rice which I also love (reminds me of the Asian cafe style food that you find in California if you know what I mean).  Steak was already cut up into small pieces and had an Asian flare to it.  The pork belly was pretty typical but also good.   I definitely want to go back to try some other things on the menu. Also found out the owner is a friend of a friend so I definitely want them to do well. My only complaint was my tiny coconut hole. How do you scrape all that yummy goodness when you can barely fit the spoon in the hole. But I got her done :)",

Kinda gives a feel for a wing house dining setting especially with all the large flat screen TVs located all around the restaurant. Food was delicious. Service was a little bit slow. I felt like the server could have checked on us more often.   We order two appetizers: the fish tacos and pork belly buns. Our tacos came out first, and the buns were still missing. I had to ask the server if it was still coming out because she came to bring our entrees which was the pork chop combination rice plate and I had the shaken steak and egg with tomato rice. So I was a little disappointed the belly buns came out last considering I ordered it as an appetizer. Why is it even an appetizer of it's gonna come out AFTER my entree? that why I'm giving it 4stars verses the 5. Feel like the ball was dropped there.  Out of all the items we ordered... All though my shaken steak was great, it wasn't phenomenal. It was a little too oily, although the flavor and taste was great. Even though I will be back for it. I think the one that really stuck out for me... Flavor and taste wise was the fish tacos. I must say it was to be one of the best fish tacos I've had.   It was all good but it was missing a bit of a wow factor for me to give it 5 stars.",

I had to pay extra for a tiny portion of noodles that took 30 minutes to arrive at the table. My boyfriend order the grilled king crab at MP. He received one leg cut up in 5 pieces for $36. So not worth the money. It was overcooked and rubbery and left him hungry. He order a side of garlic noodles because the crab comes a la carte. He said they tasted good but cold by the time he got them. The staff ignored the table for most of the time. For a party of 8 it took an hour to bring our dishes one at a time. Some of the people were done eating by the time the last dish came to the table. Entree dishes were brought as appetizers and were cold by the time the actual entrees came out.  Just poor kitchen management. The only thing the table enjoyed was the coconut ice cream in the coconut shell. I won't be returning or recommending this place. Just mediocre Asian fusion dishes for higher prices.",

    "text": "I came here a month ago with some friends visiting from San Jose. Honestly, I came here because TimothyDeLaGhetto came here so I decided to see what the hype was about.   Vibe: 5/5 I really liked how the restaurant was laid out and designed. It felt like a very hip Asian lounge that had good food and drinks. The walls had interesting pictures and designs definitely were something to look at. I come from San Jose so I definitely liked the Vietnamese fusion vibe they got going on. Service: 5/5 Service was wonderful, we were seated right away and the staff answered any questions that we had. One of my friends is almost deathly lactose intolerant so the waiter was very thorough and explained what everything was made of, so we really appreciated that. Well done. Food: 5/5 I wanted to order the Lobster Pho, however, I had just eaten right before so my stomach wasn't up for it. Instead, I ordered the Ahi Fish Tacos and Mekong Boat Noodles. The Ahi Tacos were simply delightful. The ahi tuna mixed with the fusion of vietnamese herbs were perfect. A great mix of Mexican, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes. I loved it. The Mekong Boat Noodles were on point as well. Not the best I've ever had but it definitely hit the spot.  I highly recommend this place for the creativity and boldness that they are wiling to experiment with foods from different cultures.",

    "text": "I have only been to District One twice. The food is nothing special. I have tried the Five spiced hen over tomato rice and pickled veggies. I thought there was no point in adding the pickled veggies in the menu since you barely get anything. I love that the tomato rice had a lot of flavor and also the hen. Tomato rice and hen were perfect. I have also tried their Oxtail Pho. I honestly think there is nothing special about that. The broth is just a regular Pho broth and the Oxtail seemed a little overcooked.   The menu is small compared to other pho places. I think District one is a Viet Fusion restaurant. They don't have everything a usual pho place would have. They don't offer many rice dishes or the drink desserts. So if you're looking for your typical Viet food, I wouldn't come here.   I would probably go to District One once in awhile for the Five Spiced Hen over Tomato Rice only. The prices at District One are higher compared to any other pho places in Las Vegas.  The environment is more hip and clean compared to other pho places though. It is very modern I would say. There is a bar and seating is very nice.   The service was good. I have only gone to District One once during lunch and early dinner (4AM). There were only 3-4 other parties the times that I have gone there.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! Their selection is service is great and after visiting for the first time (drive by) with my husband, I ended up bringing a group of friends yesterday for lunch. As I was given credit for picking a great restaurant, I can honestly say I would continue to bring people over, especially the oyster lovers!  Pho is great, specials are GREAT (my husband had the red snapper with papaya salad, which was beautiful presented and great tasting), but I'm a sucker for fresh oysters and both visits, I had 2 dozen of their oysters as my entree. They server Blue Point as their house special and I enjoyed the Fanny Bays. Topped with tobiko and done just right!   Wonderful selection of drinks too. I definitely enjoyed Yamazaki which are quite hard to find at any restaurant. I only wish they had Hitachino Red Rice stocked yesterday.   Nicole coincidentally was our server both times and she was not only helpful but was knowledgeable with both food and drink menus and couldn't have made our experience any better. Our table of 6 was bused frequently was checked up on several times. However another server who came over to check on us informing she will be taking over the section when I asked for our server so we could order additional items. This is when I ordered the Hitachino Red Rice and after she took the order she came back letting me know they were out. I asked what other ones they have as I was naming off the other types as she couldn't remember which one and brought us a drink menu (finds out it was IPA). I totally understand any restaurant will have certain items low/out but would be lovely if the servers could check the 86 list prior to greeting their guests. Not to mention, Nicole never informed us that Juliet will be taking over. However, she did have a very lovely attitude with a beautiful smile and I'd love to have her as our server one of these days! Long story short, everything was great! I am looking forward to trying your black pepper lobster. You will be seeing me again very soon!! Thanks again District One!",

It's so popular that sometimes, they're out of it (hence my one star deduction). Don't you fret though! They have a TON of other great dishes! If they're out of bone morrow (like tonight), then I order the oxtail pho with rice instead of noodles. If you're not feeling like soup, try the oxtail fried rice. So rich in flavor!!! Those are the top 3 we like to order, but tonight we decided to go with one of their specials: 18oz ribeye! A little on the pricy side but it was so juicy and seasoned to perfection! In all, you really can't go wrong with anything you order here. Service is great and food comes out pretty fast. Oh and if you're over 21, try the coconut mojito. It's amazing and comes inside a coconut! And if you're any age, try their coconut dessert. (Can't you tell I love coconuts lol). But really... You won't regret it!",

The staff immediately greets you and seats you gets refreshments started and helps guide you through the menu. We ordered more than we should've we just couldn't resist with such a delicious and unique sounding menu. The fried egg rolls were perfectly golden brown and utterly delicious paired with a homemade dipping sauce and a ton of fresh unique herbs. The chicken wings were also fried perfect still juicy inside, by far one of the most unique wings I've ever enjoyed. The house oysters were delicately prepared and tasted like you were at the beach and not in Las Vegas. Now for the star of the show their popular lobster Pho.... the flavors were incredible it was like a symphony of flavors in your mouth! The lobster was fresh and cooked perfectly. All the ingredients just melted in your mouth along with the fresh herbs, onions, and noodles. Jason was our server he was truly a delight with a warm smile and great advice guiding us through our decadent lunch. I will definitely be back and recommend this fantastic Vegas gem to everyone I know! Thank you District One and Jason you were the highlight of my week!",

The sports bar, main floor and booth.   SERVICE Courteous, friendly service. My server suggested some of her favorite dishes and was attentive the entire time.   FOOD Not too much of a selection. Menu consist of appetizer, rice, noodle soup and seafood. My friendly server told me that anything with oxtail is popular, and suggested me Oxtail Loco Moco which is not on the menu. Along with that, she also suggested Rice Combo Platter (choice of short ribs or pork chop but you can get both for $4 extra) and Oxtail Fried Rice.   Oxtail loco moco was good! Not like the Hawaiian loco moco that I imagined it to be with the buttery gravery. Gravy itself had a vietnamese twist with pieces of cilantro. There were plenty of oxtail inside which was super tender. All of this deliciousness with sunny side up egg....perfection.

Serrano chicken wings is also eh. Some wings tasted really spicy and some were just mild spice, hit and miss depending on where they sat on the jalapenos, I guess.

This place is quite popular during happy hour, weekend, and watching sports! Parking can be a struggle but it's all good. The food is worth fighting for a parking space.    This is a good place for Vietnamese fusion and are well known for serving lobster PHO!! Presentation makes me drool but I heard it's doesn't taste as good as it looks after finding out you are paying lobster the market place between  $35-45!! Lol... Don't get me wrong.. The pho they serve is better than most pho places in Vegas. Just be prepare for the bill.  Other popular dishes are the bone soup, oxtail fried rice, and the oxtail pho. The serving size is enough to feed 2 ppl. Soup is very rich and flavorful!! They are generous with the noodles too. The best part is that the meat is so tender that it easily falls off the bone. Yum!!   I love the atmosphere here. Servers always check on you and they aim to please. I plan to come back here again!! I'm looking forward to another bowl of pho!!!",

They definitely have some big servings here and I underestimated it and over ordered as always (LOL). We got the oxtail fries (5/5 - great for sharing, probably enough for 3-4 if shared because there's 2 of us and we didn't finish it), spicy hue soup (5/5 - love the level of spiciness on this one and very meaty) and my bf got the lobster garlic noodles (5/5 - worth the $50 price because they serve it with the whole lobster and very well seasoned noodles). This place is great for family and friends because it's great for sharing!",

I am told the wait is usually much less than this, but there typically is always a wait on the weekends. It was 110F outside, and the staff provided cups and pitchers of ice water for everyone waiting, which I thought was a very nice gesture.   For food we had the pho, oxtail fries, which were delicious! Good for sharing. We also had the fish sauce glazed wings to share as well. It was very heavy on the fish sauce, which is great if you like it, terrible if not. The batter is very crunchy, really enjoyed these. The pho was also very good, generous portions of meat (ribeye). Overall, the food was very good, service was friendly. Prices are on the high side for pho, and for off strip, but they've definitely got the demand to maintain it, so why not? Overall, this place was good, but it didn't blow my socks off. I would probably come here again if someone suggested it, and I didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes. Otherwise, I think Vegas has plenty of other great food options for the price.",

I guarantee you'll find something for your palette. District One was definitely a diamond in the rough. We live 25 mins away and we are definitely okay with becoming regulars. Highly recommend.",

I made reservations through Yelp on Christmas day for 9 people.  Well, 1 person couldn't make it that day, so I called to change it to 8 people.  When I called, they said they didn't take reservations for that day.  They why did they take the reservation in the first place?!?  With that being said, maybe it was a Yelp mistake (although, they should have worked with Yelp on that).  Even if it was, couldn't they at least make an effort to try to accommodate me?  Even after I explained it to 2 different people, they basically told me they couldn't do anything.  Can you imagine not having dinner reservation on Christmas?  How embarrassed was I?!?    Luckily, Vegas is filled with many other options, so we went some place else.  But, nonetheless.......",

Parking, like most plazas in Chinatown is small and compact. We kinda had to stalk a few people to find spots. My friends and I were here on a Saturday evening...pretty close to prime time dinner hours and didn't have to wait for a table. Place was busy too. Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks filled. I wouldn't say the food were over-priced but it's definitely not your typical \"Asian prices.\" Visitors from So Cal MIGHT get a sticker shock since we are so used to $6.50 pho and $8.99 HK cafe rice plates.   We ordered egg rolls ($6.99), two bowls of chicken pho ($9.99 each) and one of their specials; oxtail loco moco ($9.99 I think.). Everyone was pleased with their dish. Food came out pippin hot....that's always important to me. I would love to come back again and try other entrees.",

The drinks here are the unsung heroes! I've tried the coconut mojito which comes in a fresh coconut, big deal to me...if you like fresh coconut get it! The good morning aVietnam was amazing as well.

    "text": "First time here and gotta say I was impressed! For a place located in Chinatown the place is quite big, modern, clean, and just different from the rest of Chinatown. My mom came here with her friends before and she wanted to come back for Mother's Day lunch.   We came in around 11am and was seated immediately, our drinks were taken quickly and the server came over to greet Happy Mother's Day and told us about their specials for the day.   We got a bunch of stuff to share and pretty much liked everything we ordered, some were more impressive than others but not a single bad tasting dish. First of all I was so impressed with how quick the food came out, we literally did not even wait 10 minutes after putting in our order before the food started coming out.   We got half dozen oysters just plain and half with their special sauce, oysters were cold and delicious, sweet and their homemade sauce was really good, not too strong to where it over powered the freshness of the oysters. We got the Vietnamese beef carpaccio and WOW that was so good!! I'm usually not a fan of raw beef but this was sliced super thing, the sauce was sour and salty, the fried onions on top, everything just worked! We got oxtail fries and oh boy was that good! Drowned in delicious gravy with lots of oxtail meat and an egg on top, probably the best oxtail fries I have ever had (better than the one at Bachi). We also got sea snails which my dad really liked.   My sister go the Lobster Pho and said the broth was a little too salty, she added limes and stuff and its as ok. Everyone came to try the lobster pho but for $50 I don't think it was worth it. It didn't taste bad by any means but the only special thing about the pho was the lobster. Their special for Mother's Day was lobster fried rice, now this was worth it! The fried rice obviously had lobster, eggs, fish eggs, the sauce was amazing, it looked amazing, smelled amazing and tasted amazing!! Everyone enjoyed this dish.   My brother got oxtail fried rice and this was really good, a little bland compared to the lobster fried rice but I like it, a healthier and lighter option. I got the bird's nest crispy noodles, I love the way they fried the noodles, so crispy and delicious. I also liked that they did not drown the noodles in too much sauce, the noodles was still crispy towards the end of the meal. I do think their sauce was a little too salty for my taste, but overall still good.   Overall I really liked the food, they have some unique dishes that really caught my attention. Service was great, drinks were constantly re-filled, they picked up dirty plates and offered to switch out our dirty plates during the meal, everyone was very friendly and attentive. Price point is not crazy either, the whole meal was only pricy because of the lobster pho and lobster fried rice, without those two dishes the check would have been a little over $100 for 5 or 6 dishes! Will definitely come back to try other dishes and re-order a few!!",

It didn't taste like they made the broth of ox tail.  The ox tail fried rice was okay. The pieces of oxtail were delicious, but the rice itself was way too garlicky for my liking. It seriously over powered everything and you were left with the garlic residue in your mouth for the rest of the night. And don't even get my started on your burps.   The service was good, but the night I came there was a 50th birthday, so I think there was more staff working that night.   I really like the decor in the restaurant it's really cozy and cute. It kind of reminds me of boiling crab.  I definitely want to come back and try those baos! They looked so good!",

After dying in Vegas and not getting out of bed until 5PM my friends and I decided to revive our lives with some pho, the ultimate hangover cure...   My friends were saying they went before and had to wait 45 minutes so I was a little hesitate to give this place a shot. However, when we went inside there was no wait. BLESS UP.   The broth flavor is indescribable. But what really makes their bowls of pho so great is the meat to noodle ratio. They be stackin' & packin' their meats!!! So happy I did not let the wait time or the 110 degree whether from stopping me from coming here. This will definitely be a stable for whenever I am in Vegas. Until next time District One!",

For presentation I would give it 4! :) however if I'm paying $50 for a bowl pho - I'm expecting every part of it to be the best ever. According to the server , the broth was cooked 5 hours with the lobster; but when I tasted the broth, I couldn't get a taste of lobster at all! The broth was not has tasteful as I expected and lacked some flavor. My other complaint would be the noodles weren't as fresh as I expected. For a $50 bowl every bite should be exquisite - and the best is exactly what I was expecting but did not get. Given , I know we were paying for the price of the lobster - everything else still should have been amazing. Lastly , the lobster was actually cooked very well but I just felt like the overall experience was not as I expected. It was not at all worth the price.   Noted , if I were to come back I would most defiantly  get the pork bun baos again!!!! They were amazing & for an amazing price $4 on happy hour :) the pork bun was well cooked !",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for ages but never got around to it since there are so many great food options in Vegas. Finally came on 6/16/17 and ordered as much as I could since I came with a couple friends.   Let me first start off by saying that the Oxtail Pho actually tasted pretty good at first..... until later that night...   I got FOOD POISONING FROM HERE AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. IT LASTED FOR NEARLY 4 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!  District One was the only thing I ate that day, and honestly, I didn't know what happened to me. But starting at 8:00pm on Friday, 6/16, I started to feel very, very sluggish. I was playing in a poker tournament and I just could not keep my head up in the game. I was very light-headed and had to put my head down many times. Little did I know that it was the beginning to a disaster. I busted from the tournament that I no longer cared for and went straight to my room.  The next day, I start getting cold chills, body aches, high fever, and many trips to the bathroom that was just complete diarrhea every time, and it was awful. I lost my appetite, I was weak, and I didn't know what was going on. It wasn't until I texted my friend who came with me to District One, that he was experiencing the SAME THING. Fortunately for him, his only lasted 2 days. Said he took Pepto Bismol and sat on the toilet for 2 hours. I, took everything imaginably possible because I was getting desperate. I took Pepto, charcoal pills, ibuprofen, tylenol, many over priced juices, gatorade, drinking plenty of water, and NOTHING was working. My friend probably spent nearly $100 on all the items he had to get for me.  3rd day, Sunday 6/18, I felt like I was dying. Thankfully my friend stayed with me in the hotel at the Venetian on Saturday night to make sure I was okay, but this day was the WORST. My friend went to go have lunch with his other friend while I stayed in the room all day. Of course I woke up early at 8am to take my ritual diarrhea (this was about my 10th trip to the bathroom in the past 3 days) The minutes seemed to last forever, and when I looked at my watch to notice it was only 11am after what felt like hours on end, I didn't know what to do. My body aches and body chills were getting WORSE. My fever in my head just kept getting higher and higher, to the point where I thought my head was going to explode. My bed was soaked because of the cold sweat I had all night. I was too weak to open up the cap for the Tylenol that I bought, so I was stuck. I told my friend to cut his lunch early to take me to the ER. We had to call numerous places since there was such limited availability on a Sunday but we finally found a spot 20 mins away. We went there and thankfully my gf is a doctor and I told her my symptoms and asked her if it was a good idea, since I was about to walk in. I didn't feel like spending an additional $1200+ for the emergency room fee so she just told me to just go through it and not check in to the ER. I was also feeling a little better getting to move around and go outside so that helped as well.   4th Day, Monday 6/19, I start to feel much better and my poop starts solidifying (sorry for all the gruesome details but it was really that bad). I finally had my first real meal at dinner and by Tuesday, 6/20, I was better.   District One, you wasted 4 days of my Vegas trip because of your Oxtail Pho. 4 of us ordered Oxtail Pho, and the first two bowls you gave out to my other two friends were fine. The next batch of bowls that came out that came to my friend and me was the really bad batch. We both got food poisoning but thankfully his only lasted 1.5-2 days while mine lasted nearly 4 days. You also made me spend ridiculous amounts of money on over-the-counter items and supplies and I couldn't even focus in the poker tournament that I spent $1500 to enter that I was looking forward to the most the entire year. Thank you for ruining part of my Vegas Trip. This was probably my most expensive lunch I've ever had.  Also, I felt really, really bad for the other people who had the bad batch of Oxtail Pho that day. It was the first day of EDC weekend and I can't imagine what they were going through in the middle of the dessert after getting food poisoning as well. They probably thought it was the heat and the music or drugs getting to them, when really, it was the lunch they ate earlier that day.",

I complimented her pronunciation and she said that she learned how to say the dishes correctly to communicate with the kitchen. How awesome is that?!   The wait is hefty when you are hungover, but everything worth having is worth waiting for!   I had oxtail pho. It was soooooooo good. It could maybe use another hour in the pot for that fall off the bone meat, but the broth and flavor was super tasty. I washed it down with a vietchelada.  My table also had bun bo hue and they really liked the flavor.   The coconut ice cream dessert is a must!   Thanks District one for putting the cherry on top of a great weekend!",

The highlights were the: Two bone marrow, Grilled Squid, Oysters, Oxtail Fried rice, Pork Belly buns. The other dishes were OK, including the lemon grass snail, beef carpaccio and Chinese clay pot.   I'm not usually a big fan of fusion, but when it's done right - it's pretty cool and this restaurant hands down does it extremely well. I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is bright, large, clean and has a fully stocked bar with a bunch of screens for watching sports. I will definitely be back if I return to Vegas.",

Good to know they are open everyday from 11 am to 3 am.   After going over the menu, everything looked good on paper. I went with the Oxtail Fried Rice and Edamame. Wifey went with the Grilled Squid. Our friends got the Fish Tacos and Bone Marrow soup.  For the appetizers the Edamame was lightly grilled and sprinkled with sea salt. Taste was just ordinary. As for the Fish Tacos they give 3 little taco shells that look and taste kind of like deep fried won tons. The actual fish (which was not much) was yellow tail.  The Oxtail Fried Rice was very salty. I think they put too much soy sauce. I could only eat about 3 spoonfuls. That's too bad because tastewise, I dont think it needed that much salt.  The Grilled Squid was on point. Nicely seasoned and grilled. The spicy garlic aioli sauce that it comes with complemented it very well.  The Bone Marrow soup comes with a huge bone. Literally. Im not into that so I cant really say if I liked it or not.  Service was great. We never had to ask for refills on our waters especially me because of the excess salt that I had eaten.  Overall, the total tab was around 70 bucks including tip. In my opinion, the food is great with the exception of the Oxtail Fried Rice. I think the pricing is bit much based on the portions you get. The Beef Carpaccio was recommended by my Yelp friends after seeing my check-in here. Im sure I will find myself in the area next time so a second visit will be pending.

PORK BELLY BUNS: Simple, tasty, perfect. Inhaled the trio. VIETNAMESE BEEF CARPACCIO: Highlight of the meal, large portion for an appetizer with great mix of flavors and textures. This dish is what brought my overall rating up from three stars to four. OXTAIL PHO: Dish that brought me in here. Simple ingredients, tasty broth, enjoyable but not a dish I feel that I have to have again. Ample meat portion! RAZOR CLAMS: Chef special, stir fried razor clams in garlic and peppers with a kick of spice to them. Cool presentation, but wouldn't get again.   Dinner for two with two beers (Boston Brown Ale, so good!) came to $60 before tip, largely due to the razor clam special which was unexpectedly $18. Would have rather had two different appetizers instead. Good place to watch the game in a low-key setting with tasty food.  EDIT: Dropping a star due to inconsistency. Came back a couple of times and dishes always seem to be hit or miss. Recently, their porkbelly rice dish was 99% fat and none in our group cared for their take on papaya salad. The buns are always good, garlic noodles are chewy and fragrant, and the fish tacos are a HH-only item for me because they're good but tiny... but I feel like ordering outside of my few go-to dishes is risky.",

From the staple lobster pho to the dinosaur bone barrow soup dish this place has it all. Don't think this is your regular pho destination! This place has so many more to offer! Chef Khai's cooking and presentations are one of the most creative I've seen here in Las Vegas. Also great place to watch your favorite NBA, Football, baseball, or basketball games! Stop on in...You won't be disappointed!",

First item comes out fish tacos not bad we finish this and wait for a couple of minutes then our next item comes out, chicken Wings which is good. Then we wait and wait and wait. Ask the server where our garlic fries are? He says it will be a minute.  Wait 5 more minutes and catch another server ask for him to check on our order of fries and wait. We are deciding if we want to order more items. 30 minutes pass and hooray we finally get our fries. NO APOLOGY nothing just here is your order of fries. Kinda of irritated now especially as the fries are not even HOT!   Bill comes and they charge us for 2 orders of garlic fries. After telling them again NO APOLOGY! Guess that equal NEVER COMING BACK!!!!!   2 stars cause tacos & wings weren't bad",

Chicken pho was not made w chicken broth! I order chicken pho specifically for that reason. Instead, they use beef broth. I know this isn't a 'strictly pho' joint, so they probably use the same broth for all of their phos.   2.) Oxtail fried rice was too mushy & wet for my liking. I like my fried rice drier in texture & this seemed almost porridge like..something was missing in flavor too. There was a good amount of oxtail meat though!  3.) Whole grilled squid-probably the best out of the 3 dishes we (bf & I) tried. The spicy aioli was okay, but I would have preferred this dish w ponzu.   There are probably dishes here that are good/better, but I don't think I will be running back here anytime soon to find out.   P.S. I have used Yelp for yrs but never wrote my own reviews..decided to start tonight...proud to say this is my first review on here-woot :)",

Our crew started off with the Oxtail Fries (Oxtail gravy, fries, fried egg). It was a different kind of bomb since it was wet due to the gravy. I got the Oxtail Fried Rice which was cooked to perfection. My friend got the Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. My other friend got the District One combo platter. I was super hungry since I just finished hiking at Red Rock so I felt the food was so good! Tried a bit of each meal and loved it. Food wise I'd give them a 5 star. My only complaint would be the men's restroom didn't have a holder for the toilet paper and was confused as to why there were 3 sinks outside the men's and females restroom hallway. Probably helps not to slow traffic when their busy so some people can just wash their hands instead of going into the restrooms. Other than that, not a bad spot indeed. You gotta end with the coconut ice cream!",

The appetizers we ordered (Pork Belly Bun and Egg Rolls) were mediocre.  I had the Oxtail Loco Moco special, which had too much fresh onions/cilantro for my taste, but was overall pretty good.  The pho-infused gravy was ingenious and the oxtail itself was SO tender!  My friend had one of the standard pho and he seemed satisfied.  The atmosphere is more modern here than your typical pho restaurant, which was cool.  It is also a bar, including overpriced alcohol/beer, but it supposedly has a pretty good happy hour.  The service could use a little work, as most of the dishes were served without the server even speaking to us.    In my opinion, unless you are going for one of their signature dishes, you may as well go to one of the many cheap, authentic pho restaurants around every corner in Spring Mountain.",

I think because they were car I up a fresh coconut to serve it in. I hope. The food took a while to come and when it did, it was just ok. I ordered the pork belly rice bowl and my wife ordered the pork chop. Her pork chop was overcooked and dried out. My pork belly came with an undercooked egg and in a dish separate from what is anticipated. Despite this I hoped initially that the food would be ok. At the end of the meal I felt unwell.

Great place to hang out on a Friday night or anytime. The lobster pho is awesome with or with out beef, the oxtail fried rice is super good and the happy ending coconut ice cream was a perfect sweet treat. I would have it without peanuts though because it wasn't sweeten or salty just raw crumble peanuts.   Can't wait to go back to try all things oxtail.

We went there last night to get my friend Tiffanie away from the strip and I found this little spot on some random website...it got good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. Three of us split the Belly Buns, Carpaccio, Oxtail Fried Rice, and the 8 Treasures (not on the menu, a special since new years eve...had fried shrimp, tofu, and some other amazing stuff). Everything was awesome...I recommend this exact order to any of you, if you have a 4th, the oxtail fries look ridiculously tasty. The drinks were a little pricey, but they are all custom made and unique...watching Tiffanie drink a mojito from a coconut was well worth it. The ambiance with the music was perfect and the wait staff was surprisingly not in your face every second asking if you liked it. I'm definitely taking the crew from work here...

    "text": "Yes this place is worthy of Yelp's five star; I only visited it three times during my last vegas vacay which was also three days long.  On my first visit, my party came in to specifically try their pandan creme brulee which we did not end up getting because it was too early in the morning for dessert and we got full off of all the other items we ordered.  We ordered the spring rolls, fish tacos, belly buns, chicken wings, and oxtail pho.  We originally had our eyes on the lobster pho, however, being that it was forth of July weekend they were out at the moment.   The spring rolls and chicken wings were very traditional to the Vietnamese root.  However, the fish tacos and belly buns definitely have the Asian fusion flare to it.  The fish tacos came in three and was made with yellowtail (my all time favorite fish).  It was tasty and nice to look at.  The belly buns are a bit greasy, but then again it is made with pork belly.  It had a nice peanut butter taste and the buns were really good.  As for the oxtail pho, we were all surprised that it smelt and tasted great.  Sorry, but not sorry, Vegas is not known for their pho.  This one, however, had all the right flavors.  On our second visit, we went big and ordered a round of lobster pho.  It was pricey, but so very worth it.  I never had lobster pho before and now I never want to go without it.  Seriously, the food here is phenomenal.  Also, staff are super friendly and attentive.  Decor of the place is very modern, but the best part is their sinks.  I know it is crazy, however, they have sinks outside the restrooms.  It makes it so convenient when you want to wash your hands, but don't want to touch dirty bathroom doors!!",

I'm not sure if management was unprepared but the service and quality was totally absent this second time dinning here.  I ordered the Mekong River Noodle soup, pork belly with coconut juice appetizer and Garlic noodles with shaken beef & egg. I asked for the Noodle soup to be served first and balance of entrees to follow. Unfortunately the waitress brought  Won ton noodle soup which was incorrect,  after telling a different waiter who apologized BC they were busy and redelivered the wonton noodle soup to the table next store. When my correct soup arrived the noodles were flavorful and tasty and consisted of shrimp, quail eggs, sliced pork, chives and yummy broth.  The pork belly arrived secondly and it was tasty over the steam rice. Lastly the garlic noodles were totally a miss - horribly greasy and overpriced at $13.95! The waiter apologized for the poor service and offered me complimentary coconut ice cream dessert which took some time to receive since he never advised the waitress who only showed up once after bringing the wrong soup so she had to confirm the complimentary ice cream with the mangager!  I don't know if I'll return here again or if they're busy....I would avoid this place. I Hope they get their service together and hope this was a fluke incident.",

    "text": "Holy my Moly. This is another restaurant that gets me hard.  District One is a hidden gem. I typically visit this establishment at least once for all my trips to vegas. In fact, its the first place that I stop by when I drive to Vegas from Cali. Food/Eating taking priority over Partying/Drinking...what is going on?? Yah its that guud! Its known as the \"new Go-To spot\" for all people of Las Vegas. I love PHO. I REALLY DO LOVE PHO. Simple, light, and delicious. What originally caught my attention about this restaurant was that they had OXTAIL pho and BONE MARROW pho. WHAT?? Yes...an oxtail where the meat falls right off the bone like butter and a delicious bone marrow with TONS and TONS of tendon. The sight of the bone marrow and oxtail makes all foodies say the 3 magic letters: O, M, G.  The protein and meats were absolutely delicious. The noodles were perfect and weren't too soggy and the basil and leaves were fresh to perfection.  (Fun Fact: Tendon is high in protein and low in fat)  Anywho...  When Im intoxicated beyond belief, or when I have any sort of alcohol in my system, the number 1 thing I crave is Soup and Noodles, in particular: PHO. And when Im hungover as hell the next morning, my number 1 cure is PHO. Being drunk in Las Vegas is fun, but being drunk w/o any delicious food to be consumed sucks. I wish there was a 24/7 buffet. Tacos El Gordos isn't as great as the original location in SD. Steak and Eggs for some cheap price just doesn't cut it. Earl of Sandwich gets boring. And who wants to pay for overpriced room service??   PHO is my answer! Another cool thing about this place is that its open till 3 AM. And another cool thing about this location is that they serve lots and lots of craft Beers. I had a Soba Ale created by Chef Morimoto...this is an ABSOLUTE MUST TRY!  If your drunk, or if your looking for a place with great Vietnamese food, come out to District One. This place has a 4.5 star rating for a reason! This is a must-visit for all foodies, especially those people (*cough asians) who love to take pictures of their own food. This Bone Marrow is a must-see-in-person type of deal! This place gets me hard, and I love everything about this restaurant, everything from the customer service, to meeting the managers, to the decor, and the plating.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

Oxtail pho ($11.95): gigantic portion... 3 girls each ordered one and we could have shared one. Plenty of oxtail and meat fell right off the bone. Broth was good and noodles had a food bite. Overall wonderful.  Lobster pho (market price ~$29.95): for the price, it actually wasn't that bad. Definitely something to share. I would say it's something you order once, but probably won't order again. Good, but not great.   Oxtail fried rice ($9.95): my favorite menu item. Plentiful chunks of oxtail mixed on well with buttery rice topped with an egg.   Oxtail fries (can't remember price, it was a special of the day): my least favorite item. Mediocre and lacked the sparkle I found in the others dishes",

    "text": "Unfortunately this 400th review of mine is about my not so great food experience here.  Maybe because this establishment was rated so high and all the hype about the Lobster Pho...but anywho, here it is.  We ordered: Lobster Pho (MP - today was $30): Sure there is a lobster presented in this bowl, but seriously, it's just the typical beef broth, and a broken down lobster where the meat is pretty tough to chew.  It probably would have been better if the broth itself is made of a seafood broth?  Pretty disappointed.   Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice ($9): Few pieces of cubed pork belly, one egg (halved), served with a bowl of rice, and a bowl of pickled cabbage and carrots.  Earl enjoyed the pickled cabbage.  This was an ok dish.  Nothing that will warrant us to order it again.  House Special Oysters ($10): We ordered the smaller portion (consisted of 6 oysters).  They were topped with soy sauce, tobiko, slice of jalepeno and something else.  The oysters were small and not sweet.    Sculpin ($8): Earl was pretty excited that they have Sculpin here. Overall, food was mediocre at best, based on the items we ate.  Taste does not justify the cost.  The ambience, however, was great.  There was a bar, and many tvs to watch sports, news, and whatever else.  Earl said he would come back for happy hour.  I don't care for drinks so I will pass.",

I am usually not a big lobster fan, I prefer shrimp over lobster, but the pho and the broth made the lobster stay juicy.  It was a dish to share!!  The pho and broth were very good, clean and the noodles melted with ease.   I would come back to order this again.  We also order the fish tacos, which I thought was okay.  The shell overpowered the fish alittle bit so was hard to taste the fish iteself.  We also got the oxtail fried rice which was good but alittle too greasy for me.    The service was on point - they were friendly and checked back here and there.  They also changed the TV station for us without hesitation - wanted to watch the basketball playoffs.  The noise level is alittle high due to the TV and more of a sports bar atmosphere.",

Nice quality meat nice flavor too the broth.   Calamari - seemed like the frying oil needed to be replaced, spicy aioli sauce was awesome not bad.   Garlic Serrano pepper wings - I'm actually a huge fan of these one of my favorite things on the menu. Really tender and juicy with a nice spicy kick to it   Beef carpaccio - it had been sitting under a heat lamp so the exposed meat was a little cooked, also not bad.   Combo rice plate (pork chop, kalbi, Chinese sausage) pork chop was way over cooked, short robs were decent couple of the cuts were completely fat, Chinese sausage was good.   1lb of shrimp - kind of like the hot n juicy style boiling crab ish shrimp boils. The \"d1 house season\" was pretty good shrimps were a nice decent size. Over all pretty good for a 1lb of shrimp.   Overall this place is a wicked little spot. The food quality could be improved a little bit, but definitely will be back!",

It was a good mix of sweet and spicy, very flavorful! Garlic Serrano Wings - Not very spicy in our opinion, but still very good. It had a very good flavor and the wings were cooked perfectly. They were SUPER garlicy though. So much you can taste that shit the next day. The short rib combo plate - The ribs were very good, it's the only thing on the plate that has flavor besides the bowlful of garlic kimchi which I stayed away from.   Overall, the food, was very good. They have a good alcohol selection and they have TV's up everywhere playing sports as well. It's very clean and \"hip\" inside. Definitely will try out again and try out some more food!",

The many previous times I've been here I was happy with both the food and service. But now at my most recent visit I was disappointed. The wait for our server to acknowledge us was longer than our wait for food. I had to let the hostess know we were ready to order and no one even came by to get our drink order. Got the big bone soup and it was $18 compared to the $10 it was before, same serving size and taste. Also got the oxtail fried rice for $15!!!! Nothing special worth $15. Too little meat, too many raw onions, and found a whole bulb of garlic in it. Most likely will not be coming back.",

When i enter, im Always looking for Julie, she is great and always taking care of me and my family or friends. Must have appetizer is the the grilled squid, Julie knows to bring extra sauce cause my wife is always asking for more. For me, the Big Bone Marrow Pho is a must. The atmosphere and music is easy going to have a nice family dinner. Not your typical Pho restaurant where the pho comes out within 1 minute once ordered, but still in a timely manner. The only down fall is the dessert menu, they only have 2 options but I don't care for desserts. Just my honest opinion. Always coming back.",

    "text": "A trendy higher-priced Vietnamese spot close to Chinatown? Okay, I can dig that. I first heard of District One when another Yelp friend posted some delicious looking food on her FB. I had some friends in town who LOVE new Asian spots, so I took them here.  Our server was really friendly and seemed knowledgeable of the menu. It was a bit strange that they read the specials literally off of the specials board, so that if you want to see it again you have to get up and go look at the board by the entrance. We ordered apps, but they came out with the regular food - this seems to be consistent with all Vietnamese restaurants, no such thing as coursing. However edamame never showed up so we had to ask for it. She must have forgotten to ring it in, but it was our very LEAST favorite thing so maybe she was trying to do us a favor.  Onto the food!  Edamame - it's covered in this very fishy sauce. I love fish sauce but I couldn't eat more than a couple of these. Server said you can order them naked, so next time for sure. 2/5  District One combo platter - this is short ribs and a sweet sausage with rice and over easy egg on top. The short ribs were lean, which was good. 3.5/5  Oxtail friend rice - This was my favorite. We ordered with scrambled eggs though since someone in our party doesn't like runny yoke. Next time though, I would try with the over easy egg. 5/5  Lobster special - This was served cut into sections but rearranged as a whole. The flavor was awesome, but you get about 4 bites of lobster. I guess if you like the stuff in the head, might be worth it, but none of us touched that. Ugh. 3/5  Mango salad - This seriously tasted exactly like Thai or Lao papaya salad. It was good. 4/5  Pork belly buns - These were delicious! Really awesome flavor, and I loved the crunchiness of the peanuts. 5/5   Vietnamese Donkey cocktail - this is their version of Moscow Mule, but they incorporate lychee. It's simply BRILLIANT. I could've drank 10 of these if one didn't already leave me with a slight buzz in my head. 5/5  This is a fun spot to bring friends, but keep in mind it's a bit pricey. The ambiance is great though and I'd love to go back soon.  A lot of things on the menu that I still want to try.",

    "text": "District One is amazing! I've been twice and about 2 months between visits. I was greeted with a \"Welcome back!\" He said the whole restaurant remembered me because of all silliness my friends and I were having and the jokes I was making. My friends and I were calling it PhOlympics and Phoci. We're full of punny! This unusually cool weather in late May and crazy allergies, Pho is what the doctor ordered.  On this visit we ordered Spring Rolls, the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio, and a bowl of the Beef & Flank Pho. I also ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (which is a poor decision on a Wednesday night at 7 PM, I was so jacked) because when in Rome...  First out was the Beef Carpaccio, which was a little too salty for my taste, but it was tasty nonetheless. A huge portion and I had a lot of fun eating it with chopsticks. It was peanut, garlicky, citrusy goodness, just tone down the salt!  Next up was the Spring Rolls. These were nothing special and were straight to the point. Tasted fresh and the peanut-fish sauce was delicious and fresh.  Next up was the Beef & Flank Pho which was delicious. The broth is perfection, top it with some sprouts, jalapenos, a squeeze of lime, and sprig of mint. I also add a bit of Sriracha because I like the hot, hot, heat! Seriously, savor the rich complexity of the broth.   At this point we were stuffed and happily fed. We were thanked for dining there and happily on our way.   District One has a lot of seating, booths and long tables. There's a bar and TVs everywhere. Service is prompt and friendly. Food is fresh and tasty. They also have a bunch of fresh seafood that's delivered daily as well as a Lobster Pho that will happen at the next PhOlympics.   Solid Asian Fusion. Definitely a fan!",

First, lets talk about the oxtail pho. It's packed with so many flavors of the bone! You would only find something like this if you walked into a Vietnamese or Chinese household and they've been cooking that bone for hours! Very generous of the oxtail as well. The Five Spiced Roasted Cornish Hen was different. It was like a twist of vietnamese com tam thit nuong with all the sides and sauce but no porkchops or grilled pork but with a chicken. Two huge chicken thighs. The portion of the bone marrow soup and the chicken rice dish was big enough to share. Oh, I forgot about the appetizers! We got the belly buns which were okay.",

    "text": "Hipster Vietnamese fusion...  I like, I don't like it, then I like it again. This is pretty much the feelings I had when visiting District one. If a place projects itself as hipster, does that mean really they are no longer hipster? I got some googling to do.  After a cool yelp night at the Mirage, we decided a late night snack was required and after seeing some nice reviews of District One and throwing it up on my bookmarked places we decided to venture here.  Thursday night, the car park is packed, I have no idea why, maybe something was going on in another business that I didn't see or hear, so make sure you be patient.   Walking into a near empty restaurant we were seated in a nice booth with a nice window view of some cool cars and neon lights. The layout is actually quite nice, with a nice long bar at the rear of house and nice big Tv's. The centre has 4 tabled chairs with a few booths closer to front of house. This place is a hipster bar, it doesn't seem like a restaurant in china or Asian town.  We were greeted by an extremely nice sever who went through a bit of the menu and made a few recommendations. All prices were very very reasonable, and dishes were quite large.  After looking at a few reviews on yelp we went with the Pork Belly Buns. And I'd like to pass on they were great!! As a main I grabbed the 5 Spice Hen. Little disappointed in this dish, very very dry and a little bland. I tried the Oxtail Soup which was a little difficult to eat but I will say to give it a try!  I like District One, I'm a little unsure how successful it has been, but I do believe the location might hurt them a little. This market would serve better on the strip or in a Green Valley or even in the heart of Summerlin with less Asian restaurant competition.  Overall Price: $$ Drink: 3-5 Food: 3-5 Service: 4-5 Come back: Maybe",

A little quiet for a Saturday night, a few people at the bar and some tables filled so we were seated right away. The menu had variety of choices, as far as the drink goes. I had the Coconut Mojito, my brother got the Donkey (i think? it's a Russian Mule type of drink) and my mom got the Mango Daquiri. According to them, their drinks was nice and strong. The presentation that came with my Coconut Mojito was impressive. It came with actual coconut and they even brought me the left over coconut milk.   Appetizer: We ordered the Oxtail Fries and calamari. I'd give that a 4.5/5. The fries were nice and crispy. It came with oxtail meat and fried egg. I never would've guessed how good this combination was, but man it was delicious! The calamari was good, but it wasn't anything special.   Main Course: I ordered the Bird nest crispy noodles. I was a little bit iffy with the price ($14.99) but when they served it, I was blown away with how big it was. It could easily serve 3-4. The sauce was really good, they went quite a bit overboard so I give that a 3.5/5. My fiance ordered the Steaks and Egg. The tomato rice it came with was tasty and the steak was a bit sweet, but full of flavor. Needless to say, he licked his plate clean.",

The hostess was very accommodating and even gave us waters while we waited. We ordered a lot of food, I think maybe more than half the menu LOL everything was DELICIOUS! There wasn't one thing that I tried that I didn't like! The only downside was that they were out of the lobster pho so I ended up getting the hue spicy beef noodle soup which was still delicious. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to stop here again and let's hope they don't run out of the lobster pho again!",

Clearly untrained and understaffed to handle a restaurant nearly 3/4 full by 12:30 it was with a trio of appetizers that our meal began and with beverage refills scarce as servers ran in circles perhaps it was fortuitous that none of the first round proved remotely spicy, the hamachi tacos bright and crisp at $3 each while dull, limp wings and the vinegar tinged salad proved entirely forgettable...and not particularly 'Vietnamese' at all.  Moving next to larger scale items, a duo of pho dishes would prove respectable if not particularly well presented; the supple oxtail imbuing long rice noodles with a meaty sapor while an enormous proximal femur laced its broth with fat to balance ample scallions, though heat remained mute even in the presence of sliced jalapenos.  Moving finally to the items that showed the kitchen's promise, suffice it to say that tender pork belly first braised then rendered soft in coconut milk proved by far the most complex option of the afternoon despite its unexpected sweetness and although a seemingly odd choice, the throwback 'get down n' dirty' shrimp finally delivered in the spice department, a pound of the snappy shell-ons again leaving my water-glass empty while wondering why we hadn't just gone to Crab Corner or Hot n' Juicy instead.",

It was like a magical plate of juicy goodness. Druglike since it seemed everyone's eyes kept involuntarily darting back to the plate. For the entrees, we ordered the oxtail fried rice, pork belly with coconut juicez Cornish hen with garlic noodles, and steak and eggs. The hen was a bit dry bit easily fixed with an ample squirt of sriracha. The oxtail fried rice was to die for. A bit of everything in each and every bite. Garlic noodles were great in taste and texture. The steak and eggs were surprisingly good. Reminiscent of a pepper steak from the Chinese restaurants. The showstopper was the pork belly. Melt in your mouth good. I can't wait for the weather to get colder so I can stop in for some pho.  The waitress was on top of things. Topped our drinks off constantly. Always attentive and quick to serve.",

I ate there on Saturday.  Sunday morning I discovered that my credit card wasn't in my wallet.  I called District One and they had found it (I was a tard and had left it at my table).  I was able to get over there rather quickly and they had it ready for me (it turns out I'm not the only idiot who's left cards there - one guy from Texas even left his drivers license).  I checked with my card company and no other charges after my meal's were on the card. The folks at District One were awesome and I thank them for their honesty.  There are too many places in this town where a situation like this would have ended much differently.",

This place is a bit dark inside, maybe some folks like that but I like to see where I am walking.  The staff was nice, but I did have to flag down a waiter to refill my water.  As for the food..  1. Egg rolls were good, dipping sauce was great and they give you a lot of herbs.  2. Oxtail Fried rice was a bit oily 3. Garlic noodles - I love garlic, but this was soooo intense, felt like I was eating all garlic and barely any noodles.  Honestly, I don't think they used fresh garlic, tasted a bit like precut garlic you buy from the jar. 4. Coconut pork belly - you need to remove this from the menu - so bad.  This dish should have color and be braised with loads of flavor, but it wasn't. It was definitely the most disappointing one of all the dishes.  So bland!!!",

This place was on par with what I've sampled in the past. Have to say an incredible \"thank you\" to our server, Cory. I cut my foot in the Uber we had taken to the restaurant. I asked if they had a bandage and he happily obliged. Great service! Great food! And what a whiskey selection!",

We ordered the beef pho, spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue), and oxtail fried rice to share. Everything was really flavorful, but I thought the bbh was a bit too salty. I think the pho is better if you're looking for more a light broth because the bbh definitely has a kick. We also ordered their fresh coconut juice and felt everything was good. It's a bit expensive for Vietnamese food (our bill came out to nearly $50) and I feel like you can get a decent bowl of pho in that area for a bit less. However, I like the ambience, their unique menu, and customer service was really good so it makes it worth it.",

    "text": "So I've been here maybe four times? Once was for lunch and the other three times was for dinner. One of the dinners, it was during happy hour so we got to try some of the happy hour items.   District One has a very modern feel to it. They have a bar at the back, booths in the front, and tables in the middle. Their menu consists of Asian fusion with a few traditional Vietnamese dishes, such as pho and bun bue hue.   On my most recent visit, I got to try a few things on the happy hour menu. The Serrano pepper wings were pretty good. It was deep fried nice and crispy on the outside yet very juicy on the inside. The flavor of the Serrano pepper doesn't necessarily soak through as much because the peppers were way spicier than the wings, but I suppose that's expected for something that's deep fried. We also got a dozen of their happy hour oysters, which at the time were blue points. I can't say they do their oysters very well because it was dry. There was no brine to accompany it; therefore, you HAVE to squeeze lemon on it AND use cocktail sauce. I typically just eat it with lemon but that was not a choice here. I probably wouldn't get oysters here again. My friends LOVE their Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio but I don't mirror their feelings for the dish. They doused the beef in so much oil that I feel like that's the only thing I can taste! My friends also got their Cajun garlic fries, which had really good flavor. The only problem was that one batch had more garlic flavor than the second batch so the inconsistency surely shines through.   For their pho, I have tried their oxtail pho and rib eye pho. I must say, District One is possibly my favorite place for pho. It is not the cheapest pho in town but it's got the best flavor to their broth. I didn't care for the oxtail though -- it was just three oxtail bones in there. I'd rather have the oxtail a different way but it was good nonetheless. I've also tried their Mekong River Style Noodle Soup, which was only so-so for me. They put a ton of stuff in there and perhaps some people like that. It's just not my thing though. They filled it with bean sprouts and a ton of meat. I prefer to control the bean sprouts on my own like I do with pho ;P Their garlic noodles, however, were very delicious. It's got good flavor and it's simple.   Their oxtail fried rice is so popular. It's one of the dishes that you have got to try and, well, I didn't care for it. That was the first thing I tried when I first went to District One and I gotta say, I can't even remember it. I love clay pot rice so I had to try theirs. It's slightly different from the Chinese version because they mixed in the soy sauce for you already into the rice and frankly, they put too much. The dish was a tad too salty for me. I liked how they would put whole cloves of garlic in there though :)   Their grilled squid is pretty good though. It was very soft and not chewy at all! I'm not a huge fan of squid but I would definitely order it again when I go.   The service was decent. I wouldn't say that it was amazing service but it wasn't absolute garbage either.   Overall, I would justify District One with a 3 star rating. Don't get me wrong -- it's not a BAD rating. It's good. But out of allllll the stuff I've tried, only like three dishes stuck out for me: pho, garlic noodles, and grilled squid. I would definitely come back for those three dishes haha!",

Oxtail fries were soso, it tasted good but were real soggy.  Serrano wings were damn good. Who doesnt like crispy wings with a touch of heat that slightly lingers on your palate.  I had the big bone soup and a bowl of pho on the side. The broths tastes real flavorful. It was a lil effort to get all the meat off the bones but it was so worth it. I ate every tendon and meat strand there was then all the marrow inside them bones.  My friends got the lobster pho which looked so freaking delicious, ( unfortunately I'm allergic to shellfish) I have learned to live vicariously through others so I was reading his face after each bite and it was of shear delight.  My cousin got the steak and eggs, which he loved. The rice was tomato rice and the \"steak\" was their shaken beef.  He liked his dish  very much aswell   We had a great time, the food, the servers and we came at a great time as there was a lot of tables open.",

    "text": "The lobster pho is delicious! I was expecting it to be overhyped and similar tasting to regular pho, but it actually was unique. The lobster was cooked perfect and paired well with their broth. I really enjoyed it and would come back for it again, even if it's pricey ($50).  We also ordered the sea snails with a Tom Yum soup base. It was extremely delicious! I would definitely recommend this dish.   I want to give this establishment 5 stars but there was a lot of miscommunication involved that forces me to give it 4 stars. We had to come here three times in the span of 2 days in order to finally be able to try the lobster pho before heading back to LA. The first night we came here on a Saturday night at 9 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. Even though there seemed to be a lot of seating, the hostess was really slow at seating guests. Finally, it was our turn to be seated and we overhead that they had run out of lobster for the day, so the lobster pho was unavailable. The hostess suggested we call back tomorrow morning to see if they would have a shipment the next day. So we took her advice and called to question if they would another shipment. When we called at 11 am on a Sunday, the  person on the phone assured us that they had lobster. So we made the drive off the strip expecting to try the lobster pho, and the waiter tells us the shipment didn't come yet. It was really inconvenient that the person on the phone gave us False information and had us drive all the way to the restaurant. Finally, towards the end of our day, we decided to call and ask again. They assured us they really had a shipment of lobster. Because it was delicious and worth the wait, I got over the fact that we had to make three attempts. I have the impression that they must run out of things quite often because I wanted to order a fresh coconut drink and they explained that they ran out of that too.  Despite  the misinformation, I would come back here for the sea snails and lobster pho.",

It took my husband and I almost 20 minutes to find a parking space due to the limited amount of spaces shared between District One and about ten other resturants. Needless to say once we finally parked and made our way inside we were slightly on edge. Once inside headed to the bar to calm our parking headache. The bar has an impressive menu of speciality mixed drinks, beer, and wine. Once our table was ready we ordered the oxtail fries and beef pho. The oxtail was so tender and flavorful that it almost melted in my mouth. However, I wish the fries were fried slightly longer so that they would be a little more crispy to hold up to all of the oxtail gravy. The beef pho was great, the broth was flavorful and not too salty and there was a good ratio of meat and noodles. Delicious food but next time I come I will make sure to ask for extra crispy fries.",

They have a great selection of pho, soups and Vietnamese fusion based dishes - not to forget a great drink menu as well.  Rib Eye Pho which was great.  Serving size was huge, enough for two people. The broth was extremely rich and flavorful. They're very generous with the amount of rib eye as well as mint on the side to add yourself.  Big Bone Soup was filling, as well as tiring.  They give you at least two large knuckles full of bone marrow for you to dig out yourself.  I couldn't tell what kind of broth they used, but it was different than the pho. Highly recommend if you're a bone marrow fan at all.  Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio, I highly recommend as an appetizer to share.  The warm oil they drench it in is so rich and it's all topped with crunchy garlic chips to wrap the beef slices in.  Vietnamese Donkey - their version of a Moscow Mule with lychee vodka.  Wasn't too strong, maybe not strong enough but easy to drink.  Overall the service was great and the food was even better. I would definitely hope to visit this place again and recommend it to my friends.",

The waiter was very friendly and prompt.  We ordered some Garlic Edamame and a Pho Oxtail.   The food arrived in a timely manner. The oxtail was so good - literally falling off the bone. It gave the pho a great flavor.   My only complaint is having to ask for everything we needed.. Anticipate your guests' needs. It's soup to share, I'll need an extra bowl, a spoon, a straw for my beverage.. little things, wasn't a deal breaker...but I feel like those are necessities when eating a meal, period.   Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to come back!",

We only had to wait 5 minutes on a Friday night. The decor was trendy/hipster of Vietnamese-American fusion theme. Service was great. The server took orders without needing to write it down on a notepad for a table of 6, which was quite impressive when she recited the orders. Food arrived slowly one by one. The cocktail took a little long to arrive and the lobster pho was the last to arrive (that's why I took away the 1 star). Everyone finished their meal by the time lobster pho got to the table but it was definitely a surprise. The flavor profile of the broth and the amount of lobster in the bowl was amazing! We also ordered fish tacos, calamari, and king crab. All were delicious. Note: fish tacos had raw fish so it was very light and almost like a ceviche. The taco shell was lightly crunchy which made it a great appetizer. Happy to have lobster pho checked off my bucket list",

I wasn't gulping down water from MSG like at other places. Oxtail meat was tender, falling off the bone and easy to eat. My favorite meal was the Steak and Eggs. Meat was just the right amount of crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside. The steak was marinated so well and the rice.. the rice was cooked perfectly with the right amount of flavor. Will be making this my go to Pho restaurant every time I'm in Vegas!",

Love the ambiance and how spacious it is!  The booths are huge! Big enough to fit 3-4 people on each end.  They also have plenty of tables to accommodate bigger parties.  This has always been a favorite when planning big party dinners.    I've tried a number of appetizers here, but I've stayed True to ordering one entree off the menu, and that's Bun Bo Hue.  On the menu, it's listed as, \"Hue Spicy Beef Noodle,\" and it comes with beef shank, pork loin, and hue pork roll.  It's soo good!  It's unique in the way that it doesn't come off as oily and you don't have to sift through the spices to get to the broth.  Add some lime, cabbage, herbs, and you're good to go!  I rarely ever finish a bowl of pho, but time and time again, i see the bottom of the bowl whenever I'm here.    They also have good appetizers as well!  I enjoy getting the chicken wings, oysters, and spring rolls.  They offer Vietnamese beer and fresh coconut juice!  They also have different specials each night.  The last time I was there, they offered shigoku oysters for $3.50 each.  And also, Happy Hour is from 5-7pm and 12p-2am!  It's a great place to come for late night eats and being able to enjoy everyone's company!",

I got the surf and turf pho with the eye round steak raw on the side ($35) and my bf got the ox tail pho. Prices are on the higher end of course because its lobster and ox tail --- but I was very pleased with the portions. The ox tail broth was better in my opinion because its more similar to the traditional pho broth that I'm use to however I thoroughly enjoyed what I got. Next time I want to try the bone marrow broth -- also I highly recommend coming early when they open to skip the wait and have access to every item on the menu. A few of my friends came later after 1pmish and tried to order the bone marrow but they ran out so something to keep in mind!",

    "text": "Yum, this is my favorite pho place in Vegas, actually even in SoCal...as far as flavor goes. The oxail pho is what me and my hubby got. The broth is so so flavorful. The little specks of fat floating around from the oxtail /drooool. So you might be wondering why I gave it  2 stars instead of the 4 or 5 for places I typically love. Service was bad, my hubs had to get up multiple times to ask for things we needed AND the oxtail wasn't as tender as it should've been. The oxtail meat did not fall off the bone, so in the end a lot of the meat was left on the bone. $16 for a bowl of pho, so it felt pretty wasted since most meat got left behind. I tried to gnaw the meat off, but it just wasn't tender enough to slip off easily. So my husband had to go ask for knife and fork so I could cut some of the meat off.   The servers never came by to check on us or to see if we needed anything. If so, they would've known that our garnish plates never came out. We sat around trying to remove meat from bone in our soup bowls for 5 minutes and still no garnish plates. I wasn't sure if maybe this pho is so haute that they don't let you add anything to it because it will ruin the flavor somehow. I started to look around and saw plates of sprouts, basil, and lime though on other tables. That's when my husband got up to ask for garnish plates. Also, they don't refill water. Middle of the meal, I had drank a good portion and needed MOAR! Again, my husband had to get up to ask for a water refill. The other time he got up was to ask for the knife to cut meat, because they simply did not come around to ask us if we needed anything.   Again, amazing flavor in the broth but the meat texture and service could use a lot of improvement. At the price level they're selling, they should really step up their service game. The flavor here is definitely next level, and if you can overlook the price, service, and oxtail texture, you're good to go! I think I will come back though to give them another chance. Plus, it was the Monday after EDC that we went, maybe the servers attended EDC and were dragging ass from it.",

    "text": "Three words.  Phenomenal Ox Tails!!   I and my friends were stopping by Vegas after a short visit to the seven magic mountains. I and my buddies were looking for a place to grab a bite and stumbled across of District one.  This venue looks pretty modern and urban on the inside. The layout and designs of the walls felt identical to how the boiling point franchise in southern California look like. There's a bar with a menu full of many different assorted alcoholic drinks and a lot of seating areas for customers.  When we looked at the menu, we noticed that there are assorted dishes that consist of Oxtail. It's not common for a restaurant to serve Ox tail dishes, so we figured that we would try some. We ordered the Ox tail pho, Ox tail fried rice, and Ox tail fries. These dishes were amazing! Each bite into the oxtail was extremely delicious and juicy. The meat of the Oxtail was perfectly balanced between chewy and tender in all three dishes. Although if i were to pick a favorite out of the three, Oxtail pho was by far the best. I want to say that it's better than the restaurants in the bay area that serve Oxtail.  Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes to explore food dishes to try this place if they are in the area!",

Our server was sufficient, not bad not amazing. Now, the food was delicious. I ordered chicken as a appetizer and man I devoured those things. I ordered shrimp pho and the broth wasn't salty. It tasted smooth and the noodles were soft when they came out, which I liked because I didn't need to stare at her while waiting for the noodles to soften. Did not want to awkwardly stare at her while she eats, haha. Now, the atmosphere felt relaxed like a bar although comforting like eating at your own dining set in your home. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and my meal was inexpensive. Next time I'm ordering the lobster pho to see what all this fuss is about!  Pros: lots of seating space, appealing decor, clean, bathroom, delicious food, great presentation, lots of parking spaces  Cons: Customer service was below adequate  Overall: Coming back shortly! Maybe I'll order something new and enjoy the good music again! I like this spot for sure!!!",

    "text": "I love this spot!  My go to when I want pho. Their super model is the lobster pho... Everyone get your cameras out. My serious guilty pleasure... Hands down the big bone soup.  I am addicted to bone marrow.  As bad as that is I could eat it 3 times a week if I had it my way.  By big it's colossal!  The large amounts of marrow is so gratifying. If you are too shy to get your hands on this dish they will help you out.  The server threw on some gloves and went to work.  She scooped out the marrow, cut the meat and tendon, you are good to go!  Pair that with a side of rice, SO BOMB!  I have been plenty times where the big bone soup is not ready yet, or sold out.  At times I'll call in advance.   However, when all else fails there's the ox tail pho.  The meat is so tender. This dish is also delicious and satisfying.  I take mine no noodles side of rice.   The oysters are always so good here with the tobiko. Pork belly is bomb too.  I think everything on the menu is worth trying. The only thing was the snails I didn't care for, too large and chewy.   I appreciate everyone who works here. Shout out to Tony and Christina!!",

    "text": "The interior and exterior of this restaurant is beautiful. Everything looks fancy, classy, and very modern. The inside is very spacious with lots of seating and big windows to light up the whole place with the sun when it's out.   The menu is small but has most of the popular Vietnamese dishes. Their specialty is lobster Pho, and variations of that, which is unique and different but usually when I go for Pho, I am looking for the beefy broth and the rare steak. So I didn't end up trying this.   I ordered the ribeye Pho which is $9.99. The Noodles were so soggy. I can not stand super soft Noodles like this in my pho! The beef was good and they gave me a good amount for my Noodles but I barely ate any of my noodles. The broth was okay, it was plain but livened up just a little with extra hoisin sauce and sriracha but still didn't have the strong beefy flavor I crave for when eating pho.   We also ordered the spring rolls which were $7.99, I have never paid such a high amount for spring rolls before. I expected that we'd be getting more than the other restaurants that have egg rolls for half the price. It was only two spring rolls, just like everywhere else. They did use larger wraps, though, there are still cheaper places that use the larger wraps as well. The spring roll sauce was good. The veggies were super fresh and crispy. The pork was a little tough and the wrap had hardened already before it came to our table.   Our order was taken quickly and food came out right away but after that we were forgotten about. We had to ask a different waiter for our check and a water refill that was needed long before we asked.   There are many other pho places to try before I'd go back to this one.",

We got a bunch of small plates and dishes to share. The pho and wonton soup were both excellent; broth was really tasty. The oxtail fries were a favorite. Also enjoyed the chicken salad and spring rolls. The pork belly buns were just ok, and chicken wings were crispy, but a little dry (could use some sauce), and are really spicy. But overall, a wonderful meal.  Hand-crafted cocktails - favorite was the Vietnamese Donkey (a mule with lychee vodka); coconut mojito in fresh coconut was also very good, and lots of craft beers. Great pick!",

It is market price so the price changes. Expensive but been eyeing it for a while so I had to try it. The bowl is huge and big enough for two people.   The soup broth was really good! The lobster tasted fresh as well, I was definitely satisfied. Definitely good, but for  $49, I wouldn't order again.",

I am big on service and District One definitely has one of the best service I've had at a restaurant. The servers are extremely knowledgable and always attentive. Drinks are always refilled without even having to ask. When you need someone to help you out they are always there to tend to your needs!   There is definitely no cutting corners on flavor in all the dishes. Every dish I've tried has been extremely impeccable! If you are into buying seafood by the pound this place is for you!   I recommend the Shrimp with house special sauce. The shrimp are always cooked perfectly and the size of them are crazy! Only the best!  I also would recommend the Vietnamese egg rolls. Best in town!   This place seriously is a must go no questions asked!!",

The full flavors from my green papaya salad with shrimp danced around my mouth long after I finished - it was delicious!! Thank you for making this such a wonderful dining experience for even a simple salad.  I will definitely be back to try new items next time!",

    "text": "Lately I've been feeling more like a Las Vegas resident with all the temporary work assignments out here. Naturally, like any kamaaina being away from home, my gills started drying from being in the desert and I missed our melting pot of amazing food.  This day was no different. I was fiending for some amazing, Chinatown-like pho tai. Surely, most places on the 9th island would disappoint. I searched Yelp for hours, meticulously going through review after review, photo after photo and eyeing up each restaurants website. I felt like a crazed person. But I NEEDED some good pho...I needed something familiar and reminiscent of home.  Finally came across District One which was about 15 minutes from my workplace, great reviews, pics looked promising... Skeptical, I ordered take away from them anyway. Got the pho tai and egg rolls.  Food was ready when I got there, the server helping me was friendly and trying to sell me on the happy hour but not in a pushy, salesman type of way. Got back to work, spread all this vietnamese goodness across an entire lunch table, and to my surprise...they packaged the meat separately and uncooked! HALLELUJAH!!!! I like my meat still kicking because that's where all the flavor is so I really enjoy dipping the beef in for 5-7 seconds, taking it out and eating it. There's nothing I hate more than precooked, overcooked, flavorless meat. Added my sprouts, peppers, lime, basil, hot sauce, hoisin sauce, noodles. Then started rolling my egg rolls in the lettuce, filling it with the shredded carrots & daikon, mint etc. This take out experience was HEAVEN!! The beast was tamed.  Needless to say, my colleagues and I come here quite a bit now and there's a take out menu posted in the office.",

    "text": "Ever since coming back from Spain, my husband and I have been on the hunt for razor clams! We were able to find this restaurant in Vegas that actually serves razor clams, and decided to visit. :) It's Asian-fusion...and serves dishes ranging from pho, to bone marrow, to pork belly, etc.  We ordered the following: (1) bone marrow soup - huge portion, primarily consists of 2 large bones, they were huge! once you suck out all the marrow, there's not much left other than the soup to drink. you should probably order some rice or noodle to go w/ this soup, since it doesn't come with. my husband ordered this and thought it was OK, i personally wouldn't order it again. (2) oxtail pho - i didn't have this dish, but apparently this pho is suppose to be one of their specialties, especially if you like oxtail! (3) bun bo hue - my sister in law had this dish and thought it was good; spicy though (4) braised pork belly w/ rice and egg - i ordered this dish because i'm a fan of pork belly and it was yummy! flavors were great, broth was yum, and i gobbled up my dish (but had 1 pork belly left over which my husband helped to finish up). (5) 4 orders of razor clams -- 2 orders of the grilled w/ scallions, 2 orders of the black bean sauce; YES MUST GET ! it's not on their regular menu, but only available on their \"special menu, which they write on chalkboard\" -- each order only comes with 2 razor clams, so that's a bummer. each order is $8.95 too, so very expensive! I personally liked the black bean sauce once better, because it comes out sizzling on a platter. the grilled one is not as flavorful , and less salty, but some people like that version.  (6) belly buns -- pork belly buns (each order comes with 3 buns); these were delicious, kinda wish we got more, but if you like pork belly buns, then order this! you won't regret it :) (7) fish tacos -- i didn't eat this so i'm not sure how it tastes, but the folks who ate them said it was delicious. the taco itself was very tiny though, so don't expect a full size taco! they are petite.  Service was friendly and our food came out on a timely basis. We were happy with our feast, and wouldn't mind coming back just for the razor clams! :)",

They also had a really cool drink menu, ones we had never had. WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!",

(1 medium sized lobster over-cooked and tough) Extra bowl of noodle soup for $5? What?????  Garlic Baby Bok Choy dish for $9???? Coconut Ice Cream for $8? (and you can't eat the hard coconut meat). And finally, $35 buys you a well-decorated/garnished Red Snapper deep fried. WTF. We had 4 couples and paid $312 including $36 tip and still had room to eat more.!!!!!!!!. We would have spent less and had a better meal someplace else. Well, live and learn. Not going back. Not recommending.",

Ordered dozen oysters, Lobster pho- of course (do it for the IG), oxtail fried rice, Belly Bun, Garlic Noodles.   Dozen oysters were pretty yummy and fresh!  Lobster Pho is Market Price! Ours came out to 50 dollars. Broth was on point, lobster is already opened for you, and was pretty meaty but I would not come back to order it again. Like I said, its for the gram. ANYWAYS. oxtail fried rice was super flavorful but not too salty, garlic noodles were perfect. Would recommend.   Lastly, that belly bun, a bit too dry, and simply tasted like soy sauce to me. I have had better. But other than that, it was all really great!",

The bone marrow soup is picture worthy only because it is something you don't see everyday.  Two gigantic bones on a shallow bowl.  It was kind of difficult to eat because the bowl was so shallow, but the flavor was great.  Bone marrow tastes like butter to me.  The broth is beef/pho.    The oxtail fries were okay.  I'm used to Bachi Burger's oxtail chilli cheese fries.  Here, it's just oxtail marinated in sauce minus the chilli.  Includes an over easy egg.    I would say it is an experience to eat here, but overall I think it was just okay.",

Oxtail fries, for example, were hilariously bad at $12. Literally one mouthful of meat, ghetto gravy from a packet, one a tiny fried egg, a couple handfuls of fries tossed haphazardly on a longish plate. The more \"traditional\" items are a bit tastier, but with all the Asian food joints in the area, why would you come here to pay more for those?  The drinks, which should have been a good backup, simply weren't that great either. It's interesting that they have so many random Asian beers aside from the usual piss-in-a-cup suspects, but most weren't particularly good so it's a moot point. And what's with the warm pint glasses...?  If you absolutely must have Asian fusion, go to Bachi instead. Sure, their menu is a bit more burger-centric, but it's far better anyway.",

This got me in the mood for the meal--unfortunately it took 30 mins for appetizers and nearly an hour for food to come out. What we ordered ended up being small dishes, and it was surprising because the menu's didn't make them sound that way. The food was good over all. We sat in some weird corner with a bunch of empty cardboard boxes behind our table, so it wasn't a very classy experience. I'd suggest looking at pics of other people's dishes here on yelp to get an idea of the size of the plate before you order it.",

Fresh Spring Rolls - Distinct for its fried egg roll skin that's within the spring roll and for its generous portions of shrimp. The peanut sauce contains freshly roasted peanuts and is mixed in a combination of hoisin sauce and peanut butter.  Pork Belly Bun - the sliced cucumbers and carrots are not enough to cut the fattyness of the pork. However, I'm sure others would disagree.  Fish Tacos - typical Mexican style fish tacos. Therr was not an Asian or Vietnamese twist to these standard mexican fish tacos. Not sure why these are even on the menu to begin with.  Beef Carpaccio - everytime me and my bro come here we order this. This is our favorite dish here and we highly recommend it. I just wished they would use wagyu :(  House special oysters - fresh, bright, sweet and sour flavors. Topped off with flying fish roe, ponzu sauce, and green garnishes.   Oxtail Fried Rice - the texture of the chewy oxtail meat blends well with the garlicy fried rice. Medium portion size, enough to share with another person. The texture, more so than the flavor of this dish, is what stood out for me.  Also, I think I saw a Chinese porn star here. Possibly another reason to come?",

The big bone soup with with bone marrow broth is my 2nd.  The presentation was definitely a mouth opener.  And the fact that they gave us gloves if we wanted to grab the bone and chomp down like cave woman was hilarious. Luckily, the waiter did all the hard work for us and even took out the meat in the bone. The fresh coconut mojito is a must try! They also cracked it open so we can enjoy the coconut meat! Yummmm.. I'm definitely coming back!",

I loved how the broth was beefy and not seafoody, the lobster was delicious! We also tried the carpaccio, which was okay. The egg roll was good, and they're regular beef pho was phonomenal! I believe their late night HH included Jameson shots for just $5/shot! What a steal!!! I'd definitely come back.",

I ordered the lobster pho of course and for the most part, it was good. It could have been better if they actually cooked lobsters in the broth. You can tell they only put in scraps or maybe just the shells to flavor it quickly instead of leeching out the juices from a whole lobster. The broth was no where near close to being seafood-ish. As for the portion of lobster you're getting, it'll be a half. Looking back, I think I only got a third actually. For $50, you would think you'll be served an entire lobster. I felt totally cheated. We also had a lobster fried rice. That dish was much better, but again..... half a lobster. Wtf?!  If you're looking for an experience, then by all means try the place. Most of the items are amazing.  But if you're looking for all around value, you're better off going to a fancy buffet where the lobster is all you can eat and you won't leave hungry.",

    "text": "I honestly did not know what to expect coming here; it could either be ridiculously overrated (I'm sure they've gone up in popularity since it was on a little video clip) or it could be amazing. There was still a wait around 11pm, but luckily we went right to the bar. The bartender was really nice and chatty, and they had a pretty good alcohol selection (sake flight yay!) The lobster pho was a whopping $50, which for that price I could get over 5 bowls of combo pho, so I had to skip. However, we still splurged and got:  Oxtail pho: The broth was very flavorful, and had definitely been simmering for hours to get that type of flavor. They put a good amount of lime in there when I got it, though I think I like the broth without the lime (or less?) There was a good amount of oxtail, though just a tiny bit of pho noodles. Comparing this to actual pho joints, you're really not going to enjoy the pho noodles, as there really isn't much, but definitely savor all that oxtail.  Bone marrow soup: At first I was thinking, \"nah, it's just a big ol' bone and soup!\" But no! There was plenty of meat still clinging to the bone, and the broth was ultra flavorful and yummy--it was the same as my oxtail pho broth, but without the lime. My husband was so happy to get this dish, as his tummy had not been feeling well and what better than a giant bowl of bone broth? This is definitely something I would get again.  Overall, we both left satisfied and full from all the yummy broth and goodies. I would definitely come again to try the non-broth dishes, but man, that bone marrow is just so tempting. This place is worth a try and worth all the hype, so give it a go!",

    "text": "Almost two years ago, a foodie friend who frequents Las Vegas, introduced me to District One.  At first I didn't want to go, we can get good pho here, right?  I'm definitely glad I went!  During our most recent trip there, we took our other 4 friends there to introduce them to District One's yumminess.  They liked it so much, we went back a second time during our week-long Vegas stay!!    A restaurant in a strip mall (like so many Vegas eateries), District One has about 8 long booths outlining two walls of the restaurant.  There's a large table to the side that's great for a semi private event.  One of the days we were there, a group of guys looked like they were set up for their fantasy football draft.  Regular tables and chairs line the middle of the restaurant and on the far wall there is a cool bar with hard to get Japan Whiskeys.  A casual setting with friendly staff, help to top off this great spot!   Items I've eaten there: * Edamame - It was ok, nothing special.  I'd skip this item and save the space in your tummy for their more flavorful menu items. * Crispy Egg Rolls - Typically what we call Spring Rolls here, these crisp rolls filled with pork, mushrooms and taro (don't remember tasting the taro) came with lettuce, fish sauce and pickled veggies. Wish it came with vermicelli noodles too but I still enjoyed it.   * Spring Rolls - What we call Summer Rolls here, were filled with shrimp, pork, vermicelli noodles, lettuce and their peanut sauce.   * Belly Buns - braised pork belly, cilantro, peanuts and hoisin sauce.  Although I'm not a fan of pork belly (don't like to chew on pieces of fat), I enjoyed these.  Once there were fried ones too but I think we enjoyed the regular ones more.   * Oxtail fries - French fries topped with oxtail gravy and an easy over egg.  I just had a few fries with the gravy and that was good.  But if you're like me and enjoy crispy fries, you'll need to eat these quickly and when they're hot.   * Shaken Beef Salad - beef tenderloin tossed over a bed of lettuce and their house dressing.  I probably wouldn't order this if I were there by myself but my friend really enjoys this.  * Aioli King Crab Legs - I've never had grilled crab legs before but these were slices of grilled crab with a spicy aioli.  It was a little too spicy for me so I'm glad I shared this dish with one of my friends but I enjoyed the grilled flavor of the crab legs.  * Pho Tai Rib Eye - featured thin slices of ribeye and flank steak in their pho broth and rice noodles.   * Pho Ga - lots of chicken in their pho broth and rice noodles.  I never thought that I would say this but there was actually too much chicken in there compared to the amount of noodles.  I like a nice balance and I had a lot of chicken left and not enough noodles.  The broth was delicious and prefer this pho to the Ribeye one.    The first time I went 2 years ago, we were quickly seated but I guess as the restaurant's popularity increased (lots of 20-30 somethings eating there this time) we had to wait about 30 minutes each visit to get seated.    On a side note, my friend had the oxtail pho and another friend had the lobster/seafood pho and both said that was the best pho they ever had!!  Guess I'll need to try one the next time I go.",

A huge plus for me was that they had NBATV. The music is also nice, setting a \"hip\" atmosphere.  District One has an impressive bar selection. Usually, I would order a Blue Moon. Enter: Kronenbourg Blanc. I was introduced to Kronenbourg Blanc at District One, and I am glad that I have stumbled upon it. I haven't found many restaurants that offer it, but it's better than Blue Moon!  I ordered the steak and eggs. It contained small cut pieces of steak, tossed around in some sauce, tomato rice, and a fried egg. Not your typical steak and eggs, but this tasted pretty good.  They have pho oxtail as well here too, which I recommend. Their broth is better than most in Vegas which are bland. Another famous dish they have is the lobster pho, which is great for pictures. Not to also mention their Big Bone soup, which consists of a huge bone where you can stick a long spoon in and get all of the bone marrow goodness!   Great atmosphere, place to watch the games, and grub!",

The crispy wings had a little heat but it's one you should try. The garlic noodles was OK but I've had better. The pork buns was delish and really good. It had nice price of pork/fat pork which yeah gross I love the fat part of the pork bun.    We didn't wait to long to be seated maybe cause dinner rush was over. We were seated in the big table. Had a good view of the bar/TV and say for us to get the waitress attention if needed.   Parking ugh now that's another story. It's hate it. No street parking but I've parked across the street in the other plaza. Luckily I haven't gotten towed..",

    "text": "We met up with some local friends here for a later dinner when we hit town.  It wasn't so busy when we walked in so we were easily able to get a table for 6.  I really hoped to like this place but I felt the food was hit or miss.  The service was average with a few instances where we were unable to find someone to help us.  But really, the food was sort of a disappointment given the price tags.  So here's the rundown: - Snails:  The price on these were \"MP\".  I believe they were $14 that day.  We got a small bowl of anemic snails (6) in a lemongrass broth.  The broth was good.  The snails were not my cup o'tea. - Black Pepper Lobster:  MP...Good flavor, waaayyyy too salty and oversauced.  The noodles underneath also became too salty. Lobster must have also been dieting. - Shrimp Skewers: Also MP...they were just regular big shrimp. Unfortunately, these came a skosh overcooked. - Oxtail fried rice:  Probably my favorite dish that evening, especially since they left in all the tender fat and gristle from the oxtail itself. - Oxtail fries:  Nicely done fries, topping was also great. - Garlic Chicken Wings:  You got the garlic but it was sorely unsalted. - Cornish Hen - Bird itself was moist and well-seasoned; accompanying rice was meh - Calamari - Forgettable except for the spicy sauce that came with it. - Rib Eye Pho - Average  Cocktails were pretty tasty but nothing revolutionary or out of this world.  All in all, a decent meal but a little on the pricey side for what you get.",

    "text": "In town for the weekend, originally hoping to get Asian BBQ & Noodles in the same plaza, and didn't realize they were closed on Fridays. Luckily District One was right there!  What I ate: - HH oysters: Honestly, not the best oysters in the world, but pretty decent for HH price.  - HH Garlic Fries: skinny fries. For some reason these came out kind of late. I was hoping to have them with the oysters. After some time they got soggy. I would pass on these fries unless this is all you plan on getting - Oxtail Fried Rice: My friend who had been to District One before highly recommended this, and I'm so glad we ordered it. The oxtail was super tender and delicious, a great addition classic fried rice. Over easy fried egg on top just pushed it to the next level of decadence. Please order this to share with the table!  - Beef Pho: This was good. I'm not a huge fan of pho, so I can't really tell you much - Wonton Noodle Soup: This was a good wonton noodle soup. Shrimp wontons were tasty. This would be great to warm up with if you're craving noodle soup  Pros: - Not much of a wait on a Friday night.  - Happy hour until 7pm!  - Friendly staff - That oxtail fried rice! seriously, so good  Cons: - Very cold. I think we were sitting under a vent, but it was freezing cold. I get it, it's the desert, but it made my friends and I crave warm noodle soup, which is why I think we ended up ordering noodle soups - Asian parking lot. You know how it goes - spots are tight, horrible Asian drivers, very very busy and full parking lot.   Would I come again? While food was good, I think I'd rather try something new next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "It was really hard to park in this plaza, but I guess that the difficulty for the parking spot is almost worth the food. District One is a modern Vietnamese fusion cuisine that offers traditional plates like pho with a twist. There are a bunch of TVs in the restaurant and seating for tables, booths, and a bar.  Their alcohol and wine list is pretty detailed. I usually try different beers when I'm in here. They all taste yummy.  I had the steak and eggs. I opted for the normal steamed rice because I tried the tomato rice before and was not really a fan. The meat was good and the taste had a lot of flavor. No complaints at all!  The reason I can't make this place a normal go to is because the price is a tad bit expensive compared to other pho restaurants. Yes, they offer an amazing lobster pho and/or surf and turf pho, but that will cost you $30 for essentially what is still pho. If I want a normal pho bowl, I can think of a lot of places where I would pay less and probably pay as much as I would here but already have gratuity included.",

This thing is friggin huge AF. The bones are literally the size of my head. I was surprised that I was able to finish too but it was that good. Also ordered the oxtail fried rice which agrees with a lot of other reviews as a go to dish.   I don't know if I'd order the bone marrow again but I still have no regrets. That was quite an experience in itself. *pats self on back*   Great place. Clean and the vibe is pretty chill. Service was top notch as well.  Keep it up!",

We order Oxtail Fries, this was ok and kinda different. I did not like the Sea Snails. However, my friend loved it. As for, there famous Pho Lobster. It's a big portion, enough for 2 people. The pho lobster was $44.99. It's taste good. This was unique. Instead of having meat in your pho, you have lobster. This was my first time trying Pho Lobster. Would I order this again, probably not.",

Today it happened, we wanted my husband to try the surf and turf pho for his Father's Day meal and we all ended up having a bite or two of it. The broth was delicious and complimentary to the vegetables and proteins. We also ordered the garlic noodles, spicy pork green beans and ox tail fries. Had we all not filled up on broth we wouldn't have had any left overs. Since it was Father's Day my husband was given a complimentary beer which was greatly appreciated. I enjoyed a coconut mojito that is served in a tender coconut with fresh mint in it. It was delicious and refreshing, I couldn't get enough of it. It felt never ending!! All in all we had an amazing meal and experience, if you're in the area give it a whirl.",

These have been our go-to's there: crispy garlic wings (it's not spicy), beef carpacio, oxtail fries, oxtail fried rice, pho, and their thit kho (coconut pork belly).    It's a great place to come hang out with friends, eat and have a good drink (or three...) They have a great selection of creative cocktails and your typical asian beers/liquor. You can't go wrong with their Henny cafe sua da! If you're not feeling like drinking alcohol, their matcha thai tea was super delicious!   Parking can be a bitch some times so be prepared to park across the street later in the evenings/weekends. While there's a decent size parking lot, it is shared amongst other restaurants and lounges so space runs out fast.",

So husband, brother in law and wife popped in for lunch and it was not a disappointment.   We ordered the oxtail fries, lemon grass beef, fried whole fish, the big bone soup, spicy hue noodle soup, pho oxtail, and garlic noodles. It was a table full and it all looked and was very delicious.  The oxtail fries came out crispy, smothered in shredded oxtail 'gravy' and of coarse the fried egg, the fries stayed crispy for the most part and the meat/gravy was well saturated with pieces of meat, soft and tender.   Lemon grass beef came out as little bundles of meat wrapped  with betel leaves. This dish was just blah, cannot say much about it.   The fried whole fish was a beautiful dish, the fish was rather large and had a good deal of meat, two at the table really enjoyed picking the bones clean, even feasting on the fish eyes.   The spicy hue noodle soup had just enough spice to make my lips numb but wasn't too overwhelming. And the big bone soup had the biggest pieces.   The garlic noodles where also a big hit for the entire table. All in all the food was great, service was excellent. Good place for a great meal especially with a large group!",

We looked over the menu and figured out what we wanted fairly quick.  We waited a little long to get our orders taken, which was odd, because it seemed like there were more workers than customers! When we looked around seriously each table had a worker tending to them!! One of the managers (I assume) went up to us to apologize about someone not helping us and got someone to take our orders right away. I appreciated that. The service was great after that!   On to the food, we had the pork belly buns and the fish tacos for our appetizers. Both were delicious. Just wished they were bigger or served more in a dish, but that's my inner fatty talking! My boyfriend had one of their steak dishes which he said he enjoyed! I had the slow braised pork belly in young coconut juice. That dish was soooo good! I love pork belly and that meat was so flavorful and melted in my mouth!! It was on point!!!   I would definitely check this spot again and try their other dishes!!",

We were not abandoned by the waitress after we put the order in. They keep coming back asking if everything was ok, clearing up the empty plates and bowl and refilling hot water for my tea. We ordered pho, combo pork chop rice, egg rolls, grilled squid, surf clams and ox tail fried rice. Food quality is definitely better than other pho restaurants around here. I love the idea of having the sinks outside of the restroom in the hall way for the guests' convenience. The only problem why I knocked down a star is because it took quite a bit of time for food to come out. Other than that everything is great. Will definitely come back next time we are here in Vegas again!",

It was decent, but there wasn't really anything special about it. The rice was also just a tiny bit dry. That lobster pho was an all star, though! I really enjoyed the soup, which was full of flavor, and of course the lobster itself. It also came with a decent amount of noodles. It was a $40 pho, so probably not going to be a regular meal for me, but the novelty of it was fun. And getting to post a picture of it on IG.  For dessert, we got the coconut ice cream, which came in an actual coconut. It was delicious and worth every penny.

The lobster pho was eaten by a friend and he said it was awesome.  A whole lobster was put into the pho making it a complete lobster dish.  I will be getting that next time.

The beef sausage I believe wrapped in the betel leaves were soooo good!   Service was great & they're very clean, always cleans up the plates and trash that are sitting on the table.",

The deduction of .5 stars would be for the lack of parking (which I know they can't help) and for a little pet peeve of mine, not listing the market prices.  If you are going to have things on the menu that are at market price, list the prices on the chalk board or have the servers mention them without having to be asked.    Now to the good stuff.  The oxtail pho was very good.  Large pieces of oxtail that were falling off the bone.  Also, the spicy beef soup was the kind of soup one would love to have on a cold winter night.  We wanted to try the big bone soup, but it was sold out.  The pork belly buns were good, but not great.",

Food was good and we did enjoy the Pho but we can't say the same for the service. It was pretty bad and the Pho took around 50 minutes to come out even after a follow up with the waitress. We asked for the Pho for a second time after another long wait and the waitress was surprised that it still wasn't there. The wait staff should at least take the initiative to check if the orders are complete. It wasn't even that busy at that time so we couldn't understand why it took so long for our orders to come out. Wish the wait staff were more friendly too.",

The hubby ordered the cornish hen which he enjoyed, it seemed to have a nice crisp to it and flavor was there. If I return I may try the pho since they have a selection of flavors. Their version of the moscow mule the Vietnamese something was good. Refreshing with the lime taste and lychee.",

    "text": "Visiting relatives and I wondered how the food life was like in Sin City. Saw the famous lobster pho, so I had to check it out. Here was our experience on a Friday evening.  AMBIANCE: Parking: Plaza parking. It's a shop full of eateries so it gets pretty packed. Sooo good luck.  Seating: All inside with seats for about 15 groups that can either accommodate 4-6 people.   Feels:  It's a popping plaza so you have choices of where to go. As for the space itself, it's pretty cool. You enter a lighlty dimmed spot with a much decorated space with random words, pictures of people, and art. They have the tv playing sports if you're into that. Great place to organize a family size social, date night, or solo food adventure.  FOOD: Pho Lobster - (Recommend) We got it for the cost of about 50. The presentation is as it was hyped. A decent bowl size with the actual lobster. The broth was delicious, the noodles were sogged and lobster was well cooked. I did lowkey wish there was more lobster and a little more of everything but still pretty fulfilling.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Great! Friendly and quick service.  TL; DR OVERALL: 4 Stars. I liked this spot. It has a unique menu, food was delicious, and the experience was pleasant. I'd come back here again because it does have a menu like no other. Must come back to try their oxtail and bone marrow stuff.  TIPS: * There are a lot of great selections, come with someone to split orders for more choices! * On the safe side, I'd call to RSVP.",

I got the surf & turf pho which was about $30ish (market price so prices may vary). It really is quality lobster and the beef used is pretty good. The lobster definitely gives the broth a different and interesting taste. I do love the presentation as well overall. Just a random thought but do wish there was a bit more done with the noodles. Other dishes (which I didn't get) include similar takes on Vietnamese items.   I also got their version of an old fashioned which was okay. They do have a pretty robust list of cocktails and drinks here including various Japanese liquor/whiskey. Definitely worth exploring.   This attention to detail extends to the restaurant itself - definitely an interesting restaurant aesthetic that feels both modern and a bit rustic. The bartender that served me was good and friendly as well. On a Monday night, the restaurant wasn't super crowded and parking wasn't a big problem. It's not too far from the main strip as well.   Do note it is pricier than a standard Vietnamese restaurant. Overall, definitely interesting to try.",

The bread on those pork belly buns were so good!  It was kind of sweet.  Anyway it's like crack.  Took everything I had to put it down after eat half (sharing with a friend).  The oxtail rice is so unique.  I've never seen that at an Asian restaurant before.  It may be that I'm not used to ordering fried rice but it was really good.    Other dishes like oxtail fries, calamari, and the pho are probably a pass.  Definitely can be overpriced for what you get.  The calamari was especially disappointing, it was half fried peppers.  More than a few times I'd bite into a fried ring expecting calamari and it turned out to be a spicy pepper.  My friend said the pho was mediocre.  And the oxtail fries was just gravy drenched fries with a few tiny pieces of oxtail in it.  Not worth it unless you like soggy fries.",

We saw a table that still had dishes and wasn't cleaned off until we were seated. Mind you, it was a 40 minute wait. Lol Now let's get to the good stuff, which is the food! The Big bone soup was huge! It looked like a giant's soup bowl. My dad loved every bit of it. If you're a fan of bone marrow, cartilage, and bits of meat. Then this is the soup for you. Everything Oxtail is so good, just try them all, you won't be disappointed if you love meat!  Will I come back here? Most definitely if I'm ever in Vegas!",

Our waitress was very patient and attentive, even with the 5 children under 6 that were in our party.  NOTE: No kids menu so if you have picky kid eaters that only want chicken strips, leave them at home!  My husband and I ordered the following: LOBSTER PHO - The presentation was awesome a d they remove the claw meat and lobster meat for you so you don't have to do it yourself.  The broth had a subtle pho taste and I didnt have to add any sriracha or brown sauce.  Overall very good but with market pricing, one time is good enough.  Garlic Serrano Wings - VERY SPICY! Both the skin and meat were pretty spicy but very tasty.   Oxtail Fried Rice - I liked the meaty flavor from the oxtail and they were very generous with the meat.  I would order again.  Garlic Noodles - could have used more garlic flavor.  Overall a good experience but probably wont revisit.",

    "text": "3.5 STARS  After pulling an almost all nighter, we were starving! Decided to try District One as I've always wanted their giant bone soup. Our group of seven stopped by on Friday, January 25th around 12pm for lunch. It wasn't too busy, so we easily grabbed a table.  *Garlic Serrano Wings: twice cooked, crispy ($8.99) *Crispy Egg Rolls: pork, mushroom, taro ($8.99) *Sea Snails: lemon grass, chili, basil, ginger dipping sauce ($14.99) *The Big Bone Soup: bone marrow, pho broth ($24.99) *Pho Oxtail: ox tail, pho broth, rice noodles ($15.99) *Pho Tai Rib Eye: thin slices of ribeye, pho broth, rice noodles ($10.99) *Pho Ga: chicken, pho broth, rice noodles ($9.99) x2 *Spicy Hue Noodle Soup: beef shank, pork loin, pork roll, rice vermicelli ($11.99) x2 *Garlic Noodles: egg noodles, wok fried garlic ($7.99) *The Whistling Hemingway: whistling andy hibiscus rum, fresh lime juice, grapefruit, angostura bitters ($12) *Good Morning Vietnam: bloody mary enhanced with uv sriracha & togarashi pepper & truffle salt rim ($14) *Vietnamese Coffee ($4) *Hot Tea ($3) x2  So the soup is huge! I basically only got through one bone. Had to recruit some friends for help. The soup itself was okay. A little bland for my tastes, but nothing a bunch of hot sauce couldn't fix. I really liked the snails. That broth was so tasty. The chicken wings were good. Meaty and crunchy.  Service was good. Half of us got here first, so we waited a bit for the rest of our party. The staff never made us feel rushed which I appreciated. The only thing is that did take a while for them to notice we needed more hot tea. Other than that, everyone was nice and super sweet.  Fun to stop by once for their big bone soup. Otherwise, I think their pho is pretty average.",

It was the time when they had chrome large bowls.   I came back for a second time and no longer was it the same taste or quantity.   3rd time I never got the steak pho bowl, instead I ordered the ox tail fried rice with an sunny side up egg on top. 3.5/5. It used to be better.    Suggestion is to bring back its old flavors and style. It's not the same as it used to be.",

We got to try the oxtail fried rice which was just ok. Not too many flavors there. Fried fish was ok and not worth the MP price. I don't know what fish it was but it was crispy. Grilled squid was good and you could tell it was fresher than most places it was a large piece and it was worth the price. Server was seen only when she took the order and when she gave our check.  Glad there was two other servers helping us out as we ran out of water twice.",

    "text": "In addition to great food, D1 serves quality service!  We came in for a late lunch because I wanted to try this place, but coming for dinner hours is a challenge: large crowds and impossible parking. Around 2pm there were quite a number of customers all around and yet, we were lucky enough to be seated at a booth. These booths, by the way, seat six or maybe more. There's also a huge bar with several stool seatings - great for groups of any size.   For food we went with the Oxtail Fried Rice ($15.99) and Steak and Eggs ($15.99). The latter, was more like Steak and Egg as it had just a single egg, but that wasn't my issue... The steak turned out to be wildly chewy. It very much seemed like we were chomping on cartilage or something, so I did what I almost never do: sent it back to the kitchen and asked for something else. I was too worried that it was what they intended it to taste like. This place is so popular I assumed they wouldn't overlook something like this.   In place of the dish, I asked for the Pho Tai Rib Eye ($10.99). I love pho and I know this'll be bomb, and it was!  While the pho was being prepared in the back, the manager came out to apologize for the steak and even confirmed that the meat was cut improperly. Not only did she remove it from our bill, but also threw in a creme brulee dessert. Talk about service!  Overall it was a great experience, and where I may have not returned to a restaurant so soon from a bad dish, D1 totally redeemed itself and I hope to return again soon for dinner.",

    "text": "I heard District One's five year anniversary is coming up, after numerous visits, this review is long overdue...  D1 Service & Ambiance: They get busy because they're popular but the staff is always friendly and inviting.  The kitchen gets the entrees out quickly and they're good with turning tables quickly. The industrial decor is attractive with lots of wood and word murals on the wall.  There's full bar with multiple flat screens.  There's plenty of full size booths and the tables in the middle of the dining area are mobile to accommodate large parties.  D1 Cuisine:  Fusion dishes or traditional pho is what I've sampled, these are my D1 favs: The Oxtail fried rice is a rice dish that eats like a meal.  The Double down with pork chops works well with the Chinese sausage and rice topped with a fried egg.  The grilled squid is delish and big enough to share for the table or get you full as your main entree.  The spring rolls are always fresh and flavorful.  For dessert, grab the coconut ice cream served in a coconut shell that has fresh coconut ready for you to scoop out and eat.  District One is exhibit A of how Vegas has become a primo foodie city.  The Vegas restos owned by locals know what works for the city and offers a great foodie experience for a price that provides value.  We'll continue to swing by District One because they've always delivered.  Enjoy!",

Strangely, they serve drinks in plastic, party/bar cups. Not a deal breaker, but strange. We started with the Serrano garlic wings was a great choice. They were super crispy and garlicky. The Serranos were copped and placed on top so you could choose how much spice you devoured.   To the pho . . . First, the lobster broth was super savory. I've never tasted something so fishy, pho-y, and tasty all at the same time; however, it was a little too salty. Ever so slightly too salty. Also, the bowl they serve the lobster pho in severely messes up my preferred noodle to broth ratio. We ended up with half of the broth and no noodles about 20 min in, so we shared an extra bowl of noodles to finish off the broth. The lobster itself was good. The Tai (beef) that came with it was a good portion and tender. I just wish it have lived up to the hype of everything I had read.",

There are booth seating along the walls on a lifted level of the restaurant,  with tables on entry level.  There's a bar and what appears to be some beer on tap. This place seems trendy with curious options on the menu and noise level conducive to lunch meetings.   Battling between oxtail fried rice,  I decided on the oxtail pho while my husband had the steak pho.  First impression,  the pho came out promptly and it was hot and steamy.  Only served in one size, the two pieces of oxtail was tender, not too fatty and it tasted great.  For me, the broth was just okay with subtle flavors.  My husband said his pho was standard,  so not much to rave over.    This is a further drive than what I would like to trek. We came,  we tried,  we don't get the hype.",

Drinks are highly recommended as well especially the fresh coconut mojito which is around $14. They have a booklet of wines/cocktails and spirits for options.  We would have ordered a dessert but our server picked up few more tables that I think she forgot us. Oh well.",

I like the spring rolls here. For 7 bucks you get two large rolls each cut into four pieces. The fried rice here is very good also!",

We called, no need to reserve a table for two around 9:30pm on a Saturday so we show up and sit at the bar. Immediately greeted, given water and menus. The rest of the visit is why we will definitely recommend to our friends and others. The bartenders Janelle and Aaron were amazing! We trusted their recommendations and drinks and left so satisfied with our choice of going there we can't wait to go back.",

He was very friendly and a cool guy to talk to.   Food: Where do I even begin. The bone marrow soup was off the chain! Not only that I also got the lobster pho and it was amazing. The broth was so Delicious!  Eating here felt like my moms home cooking. Every pho spot I go to, does not compare to my moms home cooking but district one has exceeded my expectations.

    "text": "You never really see Vietnamese Asian fusion places, but with the 2nd generation of Vietnamese Americans growing up, you'll probably see more.  This place does a nice job of making classic Vietnamese dishes current. They've created a place that caters to the yuppy community in a cool and sleek place with also a gastropub vibe.   I wouldn't come here though for the pho straight up though. Like the pho was good, but I feel like this place is more palatable to introduce pho to Americans than it is as your go-to pho spot if you're a pho connosseiour like cough cough...I didn't spell connesousiour right and my spell check won't help because it's so off.   But this place is cousin's with one of the regular Pho spots so that makes it authentic right? And did you know restaurants can be related?   We got oxtail pho which was good. The oxtail was tender like it should be. The soup was good.  We also had the pork belly, which my sister really liked. And a steak salad which was good but awkward because the steak was flavorful and sauced and it seemed like it was just plopped onto some lettuce. I think they could refine that a bit more. Maybe less greasy for the steak?  I got the pork chop and short ribs plate with chinese sausage. That was my favorite obvi cause I ordered it. But sometimes at Viet places the pork chop is dry. This was not the case. For four bucks extra you can get pork chop and ribs and because i'm a baller (BALLA!) i got both. Well my parents paid that's why I got both. But the short ribs were great just like Koreans make. The chinese sausage was good.   So in my opinion I think come here for the other dishes besides the Pho.   A lot of people talk about this place and it has a \"buzz\" going on. Whatever that means. But my other friend from LA was there and took her co-workers from CES there. So it MUST be good. Nah but it is.",

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and sat immediately.  I liked the ambiance as well, nice dim lighting and a relaxing vibe.   CONS I was very limited on what I could eat but if you like red meats and oxtail dishes you may like this place.  My only options were pretty much the papaya salad and the fish tacos.  Fish tacos were super tiny and both were pretty forgettable, unfortunately.    This wasn't the worst place I've ever been because the service was great but would I go back again?

My friends and I make a trip to Las Vegas about 2-3 times a year, we obviously stay on the strip and don't rent cars so we have to uber here. I'm docking one star for the slow service, it's been slow each time. But the food makes up for it for sure!   My faves: -Shaking beef with tomato rice (really flavorful) -Garlic noodle (so simple but so good, love all the garlic-ness) -Oxtail fried rice (order mine without onions)  Recently had their pho for the first time, tried the broth before seasoning it with your typical sriracha and housin sauce, it was yummy!  Going to have to say. . . Their lobster pho price is a bit steep. I know it says \"Market Price\", we definitely didn't ask how much it would be (assuming it would be like $28-$35) but when we got the bill, we were taken back and couldn't stop laughing. $49 for a bowl of lobster pho! Yes, the lobster was huge but I do think that's over priced. Maybe it's because lobster doesn't cost that much in WA (even the big ones), lolol. That was our first L (lose/loss) of the new year, hahaha. First and last time we order lobster pho, but will definitely order the ribeye pho and perhaps try the oxtail pho next time!",

He then seated half of our party and proceeded to tell us it would be another 30 minutes for the other half of our party.    The manager  blamed us and said that we should have been waiting inside (even though we were inside) to talk to him and that if we wanted to split our party WE should have told him, however, he did not give us this option when we first put our name down.  All while this was happening, the hostess was seating other parties that had come after us.    However this is all beside the point.  We were quoted a wait time of 45 minutes and there was no communication from the manager about the extended wait time.  The manager also did not even attempt to try to accommodate for our party.    Very disappointed in the lack of communication from the manager, as well as, how rudely the manager treated us.",

Coconut ice cream: 3 large scoops of coconut ice cream(infused with jelly and coconut flesh) display in a coconut. OMG, i looove this ice cream that i ate all 3 scoops. Seriously, cut it down to 2 scoops to make it more manageable to eat!  Redbean chocolate mouse: it's more of a dark chocolate mousse and it was really good. i didnt taste much of the red bean.",

We had both the steamed and fried pork belly buns, good... But I've had better. Their garlic noodles smelled so great but lacked a little flavor. My favorite dishes were definitely the fish tacos! Add a little hot sauce and it was amazing. They also stir fried crab in a black bean sauce for us, it wasn't on the menu but we had seen something similiar on their Yelp and had asked for it, nonetheless they delivered. A+ for accommodation! Great service, friendly, clean, and food came out in a timely matter.",

We got here around 2 pm on Labor Day weekend and it was packed; however, my bf and I were 7th on the list but since there were only 2 of us they asked if we could sit at the bar. It was completely fine with me since we were only intending to have a light meal.   Once we got seated at the bar, we were promptly greeted by 3 different bartenders and asked if they could bring us water. A couple minutes later, they asked if we would like some drinks. I wasn't going to drink so early, but their cocktail menu was so tempting I couldn't resist! I ended up getting the Vietnamese donkey which was their version of a Moscow Mule. Ugh! So delicious! Would come back here just for their drinks as all the other ones looked so enticing.   We ordered the Oxtail pho, spring rolls, and steak and eggs. Although the food took a little longer than expected, I understand it was a busy weekend and the restaurant was packed. The service, the quality of the food and drinks, as well as great atmosphere well made up for the slight wait.   Thank you District One! Will be back!",

Dip the rice wrapper in hot water, and start filling! I love customizing and fixing my own meals to my tastes.... so this dish worked for me. I've had a lot of wings in my life, but I like the way they fry and season theirs.   If you are into any sport, there are plenty of tv's and probably atleast one that you can request the \"game\" of your choice.  The drinks and bar area is nice, especially if you are solo or just a couple.   Another positive is they were very flexible with my reservation, which had 3 revisions.  I hate doing that, but they gladly accommodated.    Probably the best part is that our 8 other guests, who have never been here, completely loved the food too!",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  District One is one of those places where it's hit or miss depending on the wait staff, time of day, and luck.  The restaurant itself is very hip when you walk in and doesn't give off that usual Asian sit-down vibe like the other restaurants in the area.  District One has a feeling of hanging out, and should be a go-to Happy Hour spot for some of the food.  Drinks aren't cheap though, so keep that in mind.  I had the meatball pho, pork buns, and chicken wings.  Meatball pho was just ok.  I know I should have gone for one of their flagship oxtail or bone marrow phos, but I messed up - shame on me.  The chicken wings had a nice kick but were all in all ordinary Asian wings.  The pork buns were amazing.  The bun, the meat, the filling, all top notch.  Come during Happy Hour for a great deal and get a few orders of them.  The complaints are long; if it wasn't for the solid food and the ultimate finale of our situation, I would have given 2 stars for sure.  First off, after being immediately seated in an almost empty restaurant at about 5pm, the waiter took 10 minutes just to take our order.  He brought over a different beer than what we asked for and then when we placed our order, it took 40 minutes to come out, all at the same time, not staggered as appetizers and mains should be.  Apparently the kitchen gave our order to another table which just blows my mind because no way somebody ordered our exact dishes.  But the worst part was that no waiter came by to check up on us during this 40 minutes without food, even with empty beer up to that point.  We ultimately just packed our appetizers in to-go boxes straight away and only ate the pho at the restaurant because we were in a hurry.  The waitress comped both appetizers, which is nice, but still doesn't make up for the previous 45 minute meal experience.",

We would of gotten a 2nd order, but had to leave room for some of that good good, the pho! Now the broth was aromatic and flavorful.  Next time we're definitely going to try the lobster pho and pork belly buns! And the visit after that we'll try the snails. Lol I love lemon grass snails, yum yum in my tum!",

    "text": "I was sad to learn that Cravin' Cajun had shut down and vowed to boycott District One right off the bat, like a pouty child actin a fool in my high chair.  Yet, after checking out the reviews and pictures on Yelp, I couldn't resist but to see what all the hubbub was about.    The dining set up is generally the same with minor accented tweaks here and there.  I was lured to this place initially because it didn't look like they took their \"V\" grade, turned it upside down and drew a line threw it for a fictitious \"A\" grade, unlike other Louisiana style seafood dumps.  Problem is, \"the mob is fickled,\" and sad to say people sometimes are quick to jump on the bandwagon.  But enough about the old joint, it is obvious the new owners wanted to create their own niche.  Nevertheless, the hip doctor undoubtedly paid a visit to this place and modernized it with an industrial/urbanish twist with the decor, ambiance and music genre playlist.  Even much of the old staff is still here, although, I bird told me that the new owners include those from Pho Kim Long amongst other unknown benefactors.  I was hungry and was recommended to try the Mi Sate, as it looked quite filling considering that it is primarily peanut butter based.  It was sort of like Mi Quang, Kare Kare and sate stew had menage, producing a love child of savory goodness.  I added the grape leaf wrapped beef appetizers to switch things up as well.  I gotta say, the dishes are unique, bold and a nice eccentric version on Vietnamese cuisine that is practically absent through the entire city and I only hope for their success.    Best of all, Vy, who looks to be one of the head honcho-ess (?), gave word that they will be offering Nikka, Hibiki and Yamazaki Japanese whiskey along with other unique refreshments.  It is now a must that I come back with like minds.",

    "text": "Went for the first time with my friend and daughter. I liked the layout and modernness of the restaurant. It was around lunch time when we stopped by, and even for edc weekend we were seated right away. Our host/server were both very nice, they smiled and were very friendly and was able to suggest. Went to wash my hands and it was interesting how there were sinks outside of the bathrooms. For myself I just wanted to wash my hands and my daughter needed to use the restrooms. Which were very clean and they didn't smell.  I had ordered the lobster pho, Spring rolls for my daughter. And oysters to share with my friend. He had ordered for himself the cube chopped beef with I believe garlic noodles and an egg on top. Also an appetizer of fried chicken. two Vietnamese coffees. And for desert, coconut ice cream. I think that's their only desert for now.  Lobster pho- the broth was good, but not great. I felt like it lacked flavor. The lobster was good too, I liked how they pick out the tail and claws for you. The noodles taste like any other pho noodle, it was not too soggy. However, that was it. It was just a boring bowl of lobster pho. the thought of it was like \"Ooh...\" and the taste was like \"eh..\", Nothing wow.  Spring rolls- I enjoyed the crunch they added in the Spring roll.  But I wish there were more meat and noodles, the greens took up more then half of what was inside. The sauce was ok. My daughter normally loves Spring rolls but this one she only ate half.  Beef w/ garlice noodles- noodles and beef were plain, barely much flavor. I felt so bad for my friend that ordered this, since he was from east coast and I wanted to take him to a restaurant that he would love. This dish didn't do it.   Oysters- yummy! I really enjoyed this and the sauces and flavors they added to the oysters. Would definitely order this again. Pretty small ones though.  Coconut ice cream inside fresh real coconuts. AMAZING. Never had anything like this before! coconut ice cream with I think green jello on the bottom! very creamy yumminess on top and nuts sprinkled as well. I very much enjoyed this desert and would come back for more. It was not too sweet for me and my friend and I thought it was just enough sweetness. Must try!  Disappointed in our main dishes, desert and oysters were great. I will come back because I want to try the rest of the menu.",

The grilled crab legs was so delicious that we ordered it again. The Oxtail Soup (Pho)with beef bones was full of rich flavor served with bean sprouts and Thai Basil toppings. Egg Rolls and Belly Buns which was braised Pork belly were excellent as well. Happy Hour is a great time to visit because that way you can sample more items. The wait staff was beyond exceptional. We will definitely be back when visiting again!",

    "text": "Vietnamese food with a twist !  SETTING:  Very modern restaurant.  Nice large wooden tables and booths. The decorations on the walls reminds me of seafood restaurants like boiling crab or crab hut, etc.  The waitress here is nice and very informative.  FOOD:  Vietnamese Iced Coffee $3.25 This is authentic Vietnamese iced coffee. The one where you have your coffee beans pressed on top in a metal filter that is placed on top of a cup. Then you mix it yourself with condensed milk. The flavor is a little bit stronger but it is delicious!  Oxtail Fries $11.95 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! I thought I wouldn't like the gravy because it looked very gelatinous, but it was actually very creamy and tasted like oxtail infused. There are bits and pieces of oxtail, but I do think that they need more meat. Otherwise, the fries are delicious!!  Pho Lobster $35 Never would I have thought that I would find a bowl of Pho costing $35 !! But it was pretty much worth the price. They give you a whole lobster! They even cut up all the meat for you so it's easier for you to eat and it won't get messy! The pho broth soup is good, but other then the lobster, its pretty plain. BUT the lobster tastes fresh and chunky.  Hue Spicy Beef Noodles $9.95  This is basically Bun Bo Hue, but named slightly differently by the way. The soup broth here has a strong distinct flavor... kind of like strong mint leaves. The broth wasn't spicy at all. This soup was ok. I've had a lot better elsewhere.  Overall, food here is good but there are not many options to choose from.",

    "text": "My first attempt at District One Kitchen and Bar came after a somewhat drunken night when someone in our party became sick. So entirely that experience could not do the place justice. After the rave reviews I heard from this multi-Asian fused gem, I had to go back a few nights later to find out for myself. I'm sorry to say that I was totally disappointed.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was very dark, even early in the evening. Dark enough that some patrons needed their phone flashlights to see the menu. The overall feel is very hip, with age ranges between the late teens to early 30's, with decent but loud music playing in the background. There are a good number of raised booths surrounding the middle table areas. Parking can be difficult outside with a smaller sized lot and a good number of restaurants side by side. Table service is very slow, with the water always running empty.  Now to the food. The heavily raved oxtail fried rice was nothing spectacular. Rather, I caught myself grabbing whatever water was left and fried rice from another plate to combat how oily it was. I really wanted it to be good, but the flavor was uneventful. Our party had a couple variations of Pho, one more disappointing than the next. The rib eye steak was decent, but it cannot explain why the lobster pho was an absolute failure. The $40 pho was bland, with the lobster meat being tough and overcooked. Although it was visually pleasing, it was not good value at all. The best dish was their rice combo platter with short rib, pork chops, and Chinese sausage. Portions notwithstanding, a pretty solid dish overall with a good mix of robust spices and flavors. Do yourself a favor, keep the fried rice and skip the garlic noodles. We did not order anything from the bar.  This unfulfilling experience will keep me from venturing into District One Kitchen and Bar again.",

    "text": "The menu has so many good options. I went with the pho oxtail, which consists of two big chunks of oxtail, noodles and broth.  The oxtail falls off the bone and is kind of delectable. The noodles are okay. The broth is very light and complemented with green onions and herbs. I would've liked it to have more complexity but it ultimately was satisfying.  The grilled Bok choi on the side was a great complement.  If I return, I would get the oxtail fried rice.  Service was great. There was no consistency to who served us but everyone was inviting, attentive and gracious. Can't ask for more from that standpoint.  There are a lot of TV's in this place so it's a sneaky good place to watch sports. Beware the TV's are small (seems like 40\" or less).",

I thought these were okayy. not bad but kind of plain. the pepper wasn't too spicy so that was cool - oysters - $1 each during happy hour.

The only thing that's \"strip mall\" about District One is the parking lot. The decor is modern, witty, fun. The music playlist is an eclectic mix of indie bands and classics. And the food tastes like it should be hand-served by a top-tier chef in a restaurant on the Vegas strip.  My wife ordered the Lobster Pho. She almost cancelled her order after finding out that it was served to look like a whole lobster (with head and tail on either side of the chopped lobster meat), but our server assured her that the head and tail would be discarded. Sans extremities, the pho was delicious.  My Steak and Eggs was amazing! Fried rice, white onion, over-easy egg. The only thing that distracted from the savory flavor of the bits of medium-rare beef was that my wife kept asking me to share.  We loved the sake flight and the extensive wine/beer/liquor list.  Though comfortably full, we felt compelled to taste the creme brulee and the coconut ice cream. Both were fantastic.   A whole wedding-party-full of folks arrive tomorrow night. We'll be recommending District One to every one of them.",

Friends raved that this place is a must try, so we finally went.  Ordered one of their specials -Rice Rice Baby! = Lobster Fried Rice MP $50 - tasty, but we tasted the fried shrimp more than the lobster.  Overpriced.  I wouldn't order again. -Craving For Seafood? = House Special Oysters (12 pc) $21.99 - worth the price and very fresh and Ono!  I would order again. -Appetizers = District One Beef Carpaccio $12.99 - not bad.  I might order again. -Special for the day = snails (forgot price) - very gamy, gritty.  NOT A FAVORITE.  Not like escargot elsewhere.  Never order. -Appetizers = Belly Bun $7.99.  Okay.  We weren't suppose to order something we can get elsewhere, but i like braised pork belly and we can make better at home.  I wouldn't order again.  Nice workers.  We had two servers.  Younger guy and a little bit order gentlemen.  Never got asked for refills on our drinks, like the people that came after us.  But overall, this place is okay.  Not such a hype.  But they are apparently famous for their Pho.  So next time, if we get a chance to want to go back again, we will try their Pho.",

    "text": "I might have accidentally found my favorite pho place here by pure chance! D1 has taken over Nem Nuong as my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.  It looks like, food wise, a lot of the kinks have been ironed out since opening. Fortunately, I was able to come here during HH, and I can proclaim that D1 has one of the best food HH in town. I agree that the .50 cent chicken wings are a bit on the smaller size, but they are tossed in this awesome asian glaze that's loaded with these delicious roasted Serrano peppers. And DO get the beef carpaccio! It's all that and a bag of chips! Tender, meaty slices of raw beef tossed in this sweet and sour soy marinade..  Can you say heaven? I liked the mango salad, it was extremely bold with garlic and fish sauce that complimented the delicate ness of the mango and vegetables. Oh, and the oxtail fries? Better than Bachi. Game over.  Let's talk about the pho. Now, it's hard to find a good pho in Vegas. Let's keep it real. But D1 has the best one in town. The broth is very beefy, which I like. The rare beef is amazing, as well as the brisket. The bean sprouts were fresh and crisp, as well as the lime and thai basil. The best part about it was they substituted Serrano peppers instead of using jalepeno. Brilliant!  The food here is 5 stars in my opinion. What killed it for me was the service. Where was everyone? I know we came in a big group, but the place was empty, and they had 3 servers, and a couple bussers. Our water was rarely refilled, and we saw the servers just standing in a corner just goofing off with each other. Such a shame..,  This place has a talented kitchen, no doubts about that. But, they need better training and management in the front of the house. I was thinking about dropping this to 3 stars because of the bad service. The food is extraordinary... So I'll give em a pass. But fix it!! Lol",

    "text": "Worth it! Food was amazing, flavors were great, portion sizes was just right. Had the Oxtail Pho. Daughter had Rice Combo Platter w/ Short Ribs. Fiancee had Claypot Chicken.  Oxtail: meat was so soft and tender,  you could suck the meat & gelatinous goodness off the bone easily. broth was flavorful and def fresh tasting.  Claypot: I was a little apprehensive that it would taste just like one thing.  But, it was done well, you can taste the components separately. Sauce wasn't over bearing to the rest of it. Although it doesn't say it on the menu, this does come with rice. Rice Combo: was tasty! Love eggs with Asian food. When you layer your bite with meat the Viet pickled carrot n daikon to use as a sponge for the fish sauce - yummy!  Definitely will visit this place again.... For sure will try the oxtail fries next time.",

With only airline food and some on the road snacks (Cheetos and Jerky), I wanted something satisfying.  My long time friend who lived in Vegas 8 years ago met up with me and suggested we go to District 1.  It's in a strip mall on Jones Blvd. about 10 minutes west of the Las Vegas Strip.  The exterior is nice and the interior is comfortable and hip.  Large floor with a lot of seating and good friendly service greeted us.  They have a late happy hour and we were there at the right time.  On the menu, the Ox Tail Fried Rice caught my eye and I also decided to indulge a little with the happy hour special of a dozen Blue Point Oysters.  The Ox Tail Fried Rice was really good with lots or tender tasty shredded oxtail meat and the Blue Point Oysters were fresh, clean and got gulped down quicker than I could finish my beer.  The chill atmosphere and friendly service really stuck out for me here and I'm glad my Vegas guide made the suggestion (Thanks Trisha!!).  I'll definitely be back ... maybe even before I leave Las Vegas in a week.",

    "text": "What attracted me to District One and avoided District 9's drama altogether with Katniss? Lobster pho... duh.  Did we end up actually ordering this $60 sucker? Nope, but we did end up feasting on some pretty good New-American/bougie Vietnamese at this trendy restaurant off the Strip. It's a sports bar vs. Asian restaurant that is sure to satisfy your hunger needs.  My friends and I came during our recent Vegas trip since everyone was raving about how great the food is even if it's a bit pricier than other spots. My large group of eight ended up ordering a bunch of appetizers and mains for ourselves that were quite delicious.  Warning: their portion sizes here are fairly generous and you can really get full off an appetizer and maybe half a main!  We started off with their oxtail fries ($12) which came in a huge bowl with plenty of oxtail meat and a fried egg on top. You have to mix and mash all the ingredients in the bowl together to get the best effect. We ended up taking some home because there was no way we were finishing that bowl. We also got some wings to share and they were decent hot wings. Crispy and tender, and definitely curbed our cravings.  As for me, I went for the big boy bowl and got the \"Big Bone Soup,\" ($18) which was essentially a large chunk of meaty bones with bone marrow. They do not play when it comes to the name- for the bowl is simply big. You cut off slices of flank from the bone and dig out the delicious bone marrow hidden inside. Simply amazing and incredibly filling.  The waitress convinced me to get a side bowl of pho noodles for $5 which you honestly don't need given how much food is in the soup.  District One was able to satisfy all of us and we left with big tummies ready to take on the rest of the day. If you want some good Asian with bomb portions, definitely check this spot out. As my friend would say though if you're considering just the pho: \"get something you wouldn't find anywhere else, and would you really pay thaaat much for a bowl of pho?\"  The choice is yours.",

Beef carpaccio is a must try - loved the combo of peanut, onion and salty. The chicken wings had the right amount of spice and were super juicy.

YellowTail Tacos $10.99 -SMALL PLATE The yellow tail sashimi tacos are small but full of flavor and extremely delicious. I highly recommend ordering your own portion you will not want to share! Garlic Noodle $7.99 + $3 Shrimp -The garlic noddle was a bit on the oily side but tolerable. The additional shrimp were nicely sized. Another great dish if your about that noods life!

Overall, the food was really good! The buns were juicy and soft and the fried rice had good flavor. The squid was not as great as I would've liked it because the sauce didn't pair very well and it was pretty flavorless without it. Still had yummy food for the most part :)",

The 1.5 lb Lobster Pho that Yelpers raved about is $49.99...  Ordered the oxtail Pho which consisted of 4 huge pieces of oxtail. Oxtail could have been a tad more tender. They were quite flavorful, however. There were only two bites of noodles despite the huge bowl. The broth was also mediocre...  Also got the spicy pork string beans which were also mediocre. Some of the beans were past due and the beans were quite flash fried enough. Flavor was quite strong.  Service was friendly by the staff.  $33/head after tax and gratuity...",

The general administration was not incredible, despite the fact that the master did marvelous from the time we called to put a booking in to the time we arrived. As dependably the eatery is hammered!   Once more, the general involvement with the eatery was great. It simply didn't send us over the top the manner in which you would figure it would (considering the scene is constantly selected a line the entryway). It was a little on the expensive side for Chinatown (just as for the general great experience).   I do need to specify that the flame broiled squid was totally tasty and introduction on point. That is my side note.   With the same number of chances in the zone, it will be some time before I choose to return. There is simply to a lot to taste.   Much obliged to you for the experience.",

People have told me that the lobster pho is not very great and wasn't worth the price at all. So I haven't personally tried it yet, but I definitely will some time in the future because curiosity kills the cat and why not!   We've had oxtail fries which not only smelled amazing but also tasted delicious between the crunch on the fries and the flavorful meat. Oxtail fried rice was also delicious but it wasn't particularly memorable. I personally did not find the coconut pork belly flavor to be good, but that's just personal preference. The meat is very juicy though!  With pho options, rib eye meat was absolutely tender and I love that they give a mountain of meat in each bowl, but the flank steak meat was horrible. I thought my jaws were going to snap with those tough meats. And if you're up for tearing through bones and carving out all the meat and meat juices from those bones, I think the big bone soup makes a great meal where I enjoy my delicious struggles by the corner of the table.",

    "text": "After seeing this place all over the place, I had to go and try it out! I went on a Sunday, around lunchtime and did not wait more than 20 minutes. My first impression of the restaurant is that it looked like a modern, hip joint-almost looks like all the cajun restaurants in the bay area. lol  We mainly came for the lobster pho but noticed the garlic lobster noodle on the menu and of course had to order that as well.   For refreshments, Matcha Thai Tea. Let me tell you-I never knew matcha and thai tea would make such a great combination. At first sip, it was just the tastiest, milk tea type of drink I EVER had. I was torn between gulfing it down in one sip, or slow, small sips to make it last. Definitely a must-try if you visit this place.  The Lobster Garlic noodles came first and OH EM GEE. Presentation wise, it didnt look as pretty as the lobster pho, with the lobster nicely layed out to retain its \"body shape\" it looked like it was tossed together with the garlic noodles-therefore, the pic did not do this plate justice.  It was absolutely the best garlic noodle I've ever had, and to add lobster??? Exquisite!   The Lobster to noodle, to garlic ratio, was just on point. It was full of flavor with the right chewy noodle bounce that I prefer my noodles to taste. In all honesty, I probably scarfed it down in less than 5 minutes.   Lets talk about the Lobster Pho. I was really excited to try it because one, I love pho, and two, I love lobster. GREAT combination in my opinion lol. Sadly, it didnt do it for me. The broth was great, but it was just that, it tasted as if you are eating a regular bowl of pho, and some lobster was thrown in. I didnt taste any lobster flavor in the broth, nor did the lobster have any distinguishable flavor. I wouldnt order if I came back.  And maybe I shouldn't have had the garlic noodle before the pho. The garlic noodle was just bursting with flavor and I was expecting the same for the pho.   I would give the pho a second try, but I am so disgustingly in love with the garlic noodle pho, that I would honestly just order that when I come back.",

District One is located in a strip mall. I've dined at neighboring restaurants   and the parking lot gets very busy so be patient. The decor is modern looking and glad the tables are spread apart. Great for larger groups too.   We were a party of 5. Our table was set and ready when we walked in.  Anna was our server and she was very nice and kind. She always made sure we were good.  5 Stars for her service. I believe she is the lead and I can see why. After we ordered our dishes,  I decided to add another order of wings. There was a delay and we never got it which was fine because we had to leave. She took it off of our bill. She handled the mishap very well.   Food: Fish Sauce Chicken Wings Oxtail Fried Rice Whole Fried Red Snapper  Garlic Noodles Grilled Squid Washed down with a glass of Crown Royal.   I will say every dish was amazing except for the grilled squid. The wings were perfectly cooked and if you are sensitive to fish sauce then I wouldn't recommend this dish. But for me it was the best. I've also had my share of garlic noodles and this is by far the best I've ever had.  The oxtail fried rice was also as equally delicious.    Overall, a great redemption meal.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are wanting different flavors to add to your palete.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and being from Orange County where pho places are plenty, I was really curious whether this place would be all hyped or genuinely tasty.   My party of 4 arrived on Sunday at noon and luckily for us we did not have to wait. The restaurant was already mostly filled and during the entire time we dined, it was consistently busy so I can only imagine you will have to wait during rush hours or holidays.   I ordered the oxtail pho for myself and we all shared garlic wings, spring rolls, and house special oysters. I'm happy to announce that the pho is delicious. The oxtail just melts in your mouth and much to my surprise, the broth was tasty as well. The garlic wings had just the right amount of kick and was so crispy- just how I like it. The house special oysters had little bits of caviar and ponzu sauce- delish as well! The spring rolls wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular. I would pass on that next time. What I really like about this restaurant is they have a great selection of food so there's something for everyone.   Now I have 2 cons for this place. The first is I feel they are understaffed. While our server did his best to be attentive you can tell he was overwhelm as was some of the other servers I saw running around. They were way too busy to have that little amount of workers. The second thing is while the pho was delicious, I believe it is overpriced. A bowl of oxtail pho is $15.99. The bone marrow soup (keep in mind no noodles, just soup) will cost you $24. Bone marrow is actually quite cheap lol.   But all in all I'd still come back to try other stuff they have on their menu. Definitely worth checking out, folks!",

    "text": "My fiance and I ordered papaya salad, ribeye Pho and the chicken wings. I asked the waiter to bring out the food all at once so my fiance and I could share.   The papaya salad was little on the saltier side and needed more acidic flavors. I finished it nonetheless given it was on the pricey side.   Our waiter came back 20 mins later and about to clear our table when we told him we haven't gotten our entrees yet. He seemed surprised and went to check on our food.   My fiance's pho came out 10 mins later and my wings, no where to be found.  30 mins later and still no wings. We asked him to box it up for me and our server was kind enough to take the wings off our tab given the situation.   I tried the wings at my hotel and found it to be spicy but still delicious. The wings had more of a dry rub seasoning. I wouldn't recommend ordering them if you're into saucy wings.   The service was slow during a time when the restaurant wasn't as busy. Food could be better and is slightly overpriced in my opinion.",

    "text": "Okay, so I've been back to district one and last night exceeded my expectations. Our server Indira most likely was the reason we had such a great time. She was quick at seating us, super friendly, helpful with the menu, and also very knowledgeable with answering all of our questions! The food was very delicious this time around and I really enjoyed our dinner!  Blue point oysters and the daily special oysters were excellent. The pho tai very tasty and the meat super soft. The chicken wings were cooked this time and had a spicy kick to them. Oxtail fries were crispy and had a lot of flavor/ meat on them. The pork buns were absolutely delicious. And the coconut ice cream dessert was a treat!  Everything came out pretty quickly and HOT which is great.  Overall I really enjoyed district one and hope that it continues to be that way. We left with full stomachs and happy faces. :-)",

    "text": "3.5 stars This is one of my friends go to places when visiting Vegas which is what brought us here.  They always get the oxtail Pho and the coconut pork belly.  I'm not really a fan of Pho so i got the ox tail fried rice ($15.99) and the coconut pork belly ($12.99).  We came a little after 6 for happy hour, which used to be until 7 but now is only till 6; They recently changed it.  The ox tail fried rice came with an egg on top, it was good but not overly special that i'd go out of my way for.  My friend says the Coconut pork belly is \"Bomb!\"  It was very tender from being braised for a long time and comes with a runny soft boiled egg.  I didnt taste any coconut, and honestly i think mine taste better!  But I'm also a good cook.  The soft boiled egg was also kinda cold in the center.  So yes it's very tender, so i could see why he likes it so much.  My friends got the Rib Eye Pho ($10.99) They though it was a good fancy version of Pho but the portion was kinda small.  They also have other fancy Pho creations like alaskan king crab Pho, Lobster, Fried Whole fish, surf and turf Pho and other fancy creations like that.  Service was really friendly and attentive the place is kinda hipsterish, i could see it as a place that chefs and people in the industry would hang out after THEY got off of work.  Its a cool, hip place with good food and service.  A nice modern twist on Vietnamese food.",

My fav are their jalapeno wings, papaya salad, beef carpaccio, etc.  My hubby loves their oysters.  Sometimes the wings could be overly fried, but the staffs were very nice about it and they fixed it for us.  I'm ok with the oysters but my hubby loves it.  Depends how picky you are with the oysters.  Honestly I only eat the fresh caught oysters such as San Francisco Bay or Seattle's.  Once u ate the best, it's hard to go back.    My hubby really enjoys their IPA selection beer, sculpin is his fav.  I'm watching my carbs so my new fav drinks is Jameson shot.    We have been taking so many out of town friends to this place, it became their must go place during Las Vegas trip.  They never disappointed us.",

For $49.00 a bowl, I was hoping more of a \"pizzazz\" with some sort of seafood flavored broth or some sort of butter soy sauce on the side (I'm just making something up), but it was just a steamed lobster carefully broken down for easy eating. The lobster was still delicious to eat and super easy to pick from it. It's an experience I had to try at least once.   The oxtail fries were delicious! It's a cool take on poutine with gravy drenched over the fries and ox tail sprinkled across it. The fried egg completed the dish for me!   My favorite of the night was the calamari! It's huge and the spicy aioli that you dip it in is to DIE for. The tentacles are my favorite, but the body is softer and less chewy.   The spring rolls were great! There's s crunchy and surprising bite inside each roll!   The oxtail fried rice was a little bland, but after a little bit of salt, it tasted better.",

Got the spring rolls, sea snails and two beef phos. Spring rolls were great. Note that they have a fried egg roll inside which I've never had in California. Maybe it's a Las Vegas thing? Not sure.  Sea snails are HUGE. I was expecting the small ones. Beware acquired taste. It didn't really taste like my memory of periwinkle snails nor escargot. The broth was flavorful though and they give 12 snails, which is PLENTY. Pho broth was deep but a little cloudy. A lot of veggies and they were very clean. They give a lot of beef but the tendon pho I got had little tiny chunks of tendon, not like the big chunks I was used to and expecting. Only wish there was a little more noodles and this is coming from a small bowl eater.   Spotty service - our server was great until she left and left us hanging waiting for the check.",

Ordered green papaya salad to start for our vege quota, belly buns which were delicious, big bone soup, which was huge but the broth was so flavourful, and the star of the meal, the pho ox tail. Broth is simply amazing. Not even going to try to describe it. I normally drink some of the broth when I have pho, but with the ox tail pho I drank every last drop.  Will definitely be back and highly recommend to anyone. A good, hot steaming bowl of pho is like a balm to your soul...must try!!!",

We ordered: edamame (spicy garlic add $1.50 more);  crispy egg rolls - yummy  served with greens and lettuce for you to wrap and eat. Rolls had a nice crunch texture.  Lobster  pho - the presentation was full on with the entire . My fiend orders it and they thought it was quite tasty.  Pho tai - decent the meat was tender Pork bone soup - this doesn't come with noodles. If you want noodles you have to add $5. Not sure if it's worth adding for that price.  Fresh young coconut  mojito - never had one of these but it was super refreshing and very  tasty.   Towards the end we were all curious how much the lobster pho was going to price out. We all threw in guesstimate: 1. $31 and under 2. $32 3. Over $36. When the bill came it was $50 market price.   The pricing for all the other food matches to taste and portion. The only one that was steep was the  pho. However I think it's worth to try if you haven't before.",

The broth had good flavor and the meat was super tender. My only complaint would be there wasn't much meat, but what was there was really good! -Lobster fried rice was okay... not worth the $49. The waiter told us there would be 1.5 lbs of lobster in there, and although I know the shell weighs a good chunk of that 1.5 lbs, I still expected there to be more meat for that price. -Egg rolls were suuper crispy, crunchy, and yummy! Smaller than usual, but tasted better than most places. I'm all about a good crunch factor. -Speaking of crunch factor, the beef carpaccio was by far my favorite dish due to the flavors, tenderness, and crunch factor they added to the dish! The meat had a buttery texture from the sauces and melts in your mouth. *drool* -Service was great. -Ambiance was very casual and not that trendy like most places around Chinatown, but still nice for a casual night out with a group of friends or dinner date.  Definitely will be coming back here!",

I have seen the menu evolve over time and I can officially vouch that the menu is now FULL of hitters.  Surf & turf pho - so worth the hype at $35(?) - the soup definitely has that seafood flavor but is not too salty Bun bo hue - spicy but keeps you wanting more. Oxtail pho - honestly... the meat was so tender and I forced my boyfriend to halfway switch with me so I could finish his. Sea snails - I admit - I was a first timer but they are SO GOOD. My dad was also a huge fan and also worth the MP.  I have had so many items here from the squid (spicy & delicious) to the pork belly in coconut (also bomb) and I would say that where District One is at now with their menu is perfect. The food is SO good, it's consistent, and priced extremely reasonably.  I will admit that there was a time that I feel like they were losing their touch but after this last experience, I can truly state that they have reclaimed the throne. Service was great - our server & busser were on it & our water glasses were never empty. The food was fresh & everyone around us seemed just as satisfied as we were.  I highly recommend stopping in for any type of meal whether it's to recover from a hangover or you just want to have a chill dinner. Yes - the price for a surf & turf pho is more expensive but you definitely pay for what you get and what you get is quality & food coma. Can't wait to come back again soon!",

Flavor was very well balance and simple, exactly how pho should taste like. The service was also very good and attentive. Again, I was very drunk at that time and so I am very willing to go back sober and actually try their menu more. If I find it subpar then I'd edit this review.",

Sunday night around 9:40PM I came down to a 60-70% occupied D1 with zero to little seat waiting time with my good friend from high school whom has only been here once which was years ago so I ordered a bit of everything that I thought would savor our tastebuds.   We ordered around 4 appetizers, 2 full entrees, 2 desserts & 2 iced matcha Thai teas which was totally more than what 2 average sized human beings can devour, BUT with ZERO regrets as all the food came out fast, fresh & delicious. I now have some delicious left overs for lunch tomorrow :^)  Our service was consistent as TK, Corey & a female server with glasses continually checked up on our status to make sure we were doing good. All in all, the atmosphere, food & music vibes were great as always!   Til next time D1!",

I went here with my wife, 1 year old, and mom.  The service for all of us was superb, even for my child.  We had the Pork Belly Buns, Ox Tail Pho, \"Steak and Eggs\", and the Slow Braised Pork.  The Ox Tail Pho here is amazing, definitely bang for your buck.  The meat on the tail is perfect, and the amount of noodles they give is the perfect amount.  All Vietnamese places in Vegas usually give a tiny amount.  The Pork Belly Buns were delicious.  The steak and eggs were perfectly made, the steaks were nicely marinated.  The Slow Braised Pork is nice and soft.  The sauce is perfect, and loved the way the egg was cooked.   We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was recommended by some acquaintances for this restaurant and I would have to say it is overall just.... OK.... but not something very specail  You walk in here and it is definitely a modern vietnamese fusion restaurant that attracts mainly the younger crowd with their style and taste of their dining room. I do like it, im 25 years old, but personally its not what I expect when I like some Vietnamese food, would rather have some average spot with no style serv me some good flavorful pho.   For their food, most yelpers here probably will not agree, they probably had an off day but I had the Ox tail pho and it was just mediocre. Some of us has the same thing, and others had some appitizers and other kinds of pho, I forgot which ones.   What I was amazed from my pho was the oxtail itself. two giant pieces of ox tail thats probably enough to feed a lion, fell right off the bone as im picking and eating it. was very easy to eat it. Though the broth with the pho, completely bland to me. When I have Vietnamese food in boston, the broth is usually at its bold flavors in restaurants I go to, but this one was just so disappointing to me.   My mother also had pho, I dont know what its called but its just simple slices of meat, but she didnt eat any because it looked like it was all fat. Im aware prime brisket is 50% fat but this seem to be 75%. meh...  Also had some appitizers, soft shell crab was pretty good, pork belly bun was as well, but we had the leaf wrapped beef, tasted bland as well.   For their service, definitely on point. I was with embarassing asian elders who doesnt know the vibe of respect of talking too loud and sounding rude all the time. the server I had was definitely cooperating and it was great, it didnt seem she was bothered. We got everything we ordered and such.  For the money, its just okay, I can pay $15 for ox tail pho, and I would definitely try lobster because it's defintiely something new. but for now, I would have to give this 3 stars for just being a mediocre place. hope they do something about the broth though",

    "text": "Last month, we saw an article in the local Vegas restaurant review.  It gave it rave reviews.  So, we decided to try it out.  Since that review, we have returned 4 times!  Yes, the place is awesome.  And, we wanted to make sure that we tried all the dishes.  The food is rather unique and quality is great.  Here is our review:  1.  Service - Excellent.  I have no idea why some reviews are negative.  Every time we are there, there are usually 2-3 people waiting on us.  They properly fill our drinks, ensure that our finished plates are removed, and always ask if we need anything else.  In addition, the manager comes around and checks to see how everything is going.  Honestly, usually, services at Viet and/or Chinese restaurants are very subpar.  However, we think District One's staff and service are exceptional.  2.  Atmosphere -- it is a bar.  I think it is laid out quite nicely and not too noisy.  Only issue that I have are the steps going up to the next level.  If people don't watch their step, they can have an awful spill.  Maybe, they can install a little ramp or something... Other than that, it is fine.  3.  Food - absolutely amazing!  Here are our recommendations from our 4 visits:  a.  Appetizers -- usually, we order from the day's special.        Here are the appetizers that we totally enjoyed:  - Razor Clams -- very good, tender, and flavorful (note: this is our favorite appetizer)  - Snails -- surprisingly, this was HUGE!    - Shaken Beef Salad -- is one of my favorite dishes.  Greens checked!  - Taco Talapia  - Roasted Squid       Here are the appetizers that we think are \"okay\"  - Pork Belly cooked in coconut.. it was a little bit too \"fatty\".  :)  I enjoyed it, but the wife stayed away due to the amount of fat on the meat.   - Pork Belly Buns (same as above) - Scallops - I was a bit disappointed.  Scallops are usually more plump.  The sauce actually overwhelmed the scallops. - Oxtail loco-moco something... Hawaiian style -- this was not good  b.  Entrees - Lobster Pho -- okay.. so, it is a bit pricey.. think we paid $30.  But, oh my, this was so good and worth it.  We loved this dish.  Pho was very flavorful and one dish could be shared with 3 people!  So, it even out about $10 bucks person.  Love the presentation!! - Lobster with Noodles.  again, this was a bit pricey -- about $70.  I think this was cooked in some tamarind sauce and served over noodles.  Personally, I thought this was good, but not great.  I rather have it served over fried rice.   - 5 Spice Chicken w/ side of yellow rice.   Very good dish.  Love the spices and the chicken! - Oxtail Fried Rice (unlike the Loco Moco), we enjoyed this dish.  Note:  next time, we will try the other pho dishes...    c.  Dessert (there is only one on the menu) Nothing beats the Vanilla ice cream w/ peanuts served on a coconut \"meat\" shell.  It serves 2; unless, you really have a sweet tooth.  My family love this part of the meal!  Overall, we love this place.  Service is great, food is awesome, and the price is reasonable.  This is definitely now one of our favorite places.    Cheers!",

    "text": "All I have is say is \"WOW!!\" This place is absolutely amazing. From the service to the cute decor and.. The food! Omg the food. So good! Was not expecting the different types of flavors and dishes that this place had to offer. Definitely not your typical Vietnamese restaurant that you find in china town. I want to say it's more of an Asain fusion with a primary focus on Vietnamese style cooking/flavors. My group and I ended up ordering family style which I felt was the best way to try more of the dishes because the menu had so many options to offer! Everything sounded so tasty!   There wasn't a single dish that we didn't enjoy, but I highly recommend the shaken beef salad, pork belly with boiled egg, beef tacos (my favorite!! Not on the menu), steak and eggs and Ox tail pho. Hands down best pho I've ever had. I usually have to add hoisen sauce to enhance the flavor but this was perfect the way it came. The food was so flavorful and the quality was perfect. The steak was so tender, blew my mind away!  If you're around the area this is definitely a place to check out. You won't be disappointed:) I know my friends and I will be returning a visit real soon",

However since I've discover many a place from yelp I can let this one to the public too. District 1 an Vietnamese inspired fusion restaurant located just North East on Jones and Spring mtn.  As soon as you enter the place you realize you will have a pleasant time. Very welcoming atmosphere and not too loud on the decorations. The wait staff are very pleasant and since it's not \"grand opening\" yet you are bound to be seated pretty soon.  PRO's:: Plenty of TV 's to watch anything.  Music not too loud which is always good  Fast food preparations  Fresh food and moderately priced Crazy Japanese Whisky selection ( a few that you will not find in the States. ) Draft beer selection is pretty impressive for a non gaming establishment  Liquor selection is great , high end alcoholic favorites that I will not able to afford lol and less expensive one for working class. Lol.  They even have a Sake on tap \" how ridiculous is that \".  I've spoken to the owner and requested they carry Carlsberg ( now am not a fool and know most times owners don't give a damn unless am spending crazy amounts of money here,... But to my amazement the next time I came here. Guess what. my beer ) I felt the love and it's now my fav place to chill and try their tapas style menu and sip on chilled beer and stare at the expensive liquor. Lol.  Am not much of a sea food person but my wife swears that their selection is fresh and loves the fish tacos / razor clams/ lobster pho/ and Dungeoneous crabs. The list can go on but I'd bore everyone. So go child this gem of a place and you will not be disappointed.",

Not the normal as it seems they use a warm ponzu or type of oil on it. It is different than what I'm use to which is more lemon and being 100% raw. I would not get this again   2. Serrano wings. We were with our daughter so our server said peppers on the side. I thought good. Wrong. It's like a salt and pepper style wing so if it's on the side it has 0 flavor. But the chicken was fried very well. I will get this again but not with the peppers on the side.   3. Ox tail. Big healthy portion of meaty tail. The soup was very flavorful but not thick and heavy. I will get this again.   4. Rice with short rims. The ribs were very very good but the rice itself was hard and reminded me of day old rice you use for fried rice. Maybe it's just a Vegas thing?  Not cheap but it's Vegas, what is?",

    "text": "Had some really good food at this asian fusion (heavy on the Vietnamese) gastropub of sorts on Jones Blvd.   Some Vegas locals took me here for a late lunch and I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. I had heard good things about District One so it was great to finally go there the last time I was in town.  We started off with the oxtail fries ($11.99) which we topped with an over easy egg. The fries were crunchy, the oxtail was tender and delicious in its own gravy. I really liked this dish and recommend that you get it. It was really good. Next we had the beef carpaccio ($12.99). It was excellent. My favorite version of beef carpaccio so far. It was perfectly thin ribeye with sesame and citrus flavors. It was just so very good. Ordering this next time for sure. Next were the pork belly buns (3 for $7.99). They were good with the peanut sauce and the braised pork belly was soft and tender. I could have done without the cilantro but that was just standard on the order. Good dish. We also had the oxtail fried rice ($12.99). SO GOOD. So flavorful... You have to order it. Shredded oxtail with all kinds of delicious seasoning with another over easy egg as a topping. Only thing I would change on this dish is add more oxtail for sure. The pics I took doesnt show too much oxtail in it and it could have used some more. Lastly we had the beef and lemongrass wrapped in betel leaves ($7.99). This was my least favorite of all the dishes we had. The lemongrass flavor was too strong IMO. The beef was tender and there were other seasoning flavors I couldnt make out. I would pass on that next time.   Service was very good. Jeff was excellent. Very personable guy and we appreciated his attentiveness to our party. Kudos to him... Cant wait to eat at District One the next time I'm in town. Heard that whole fried fish dish is the one!  Parking in a shared big lot. Some are 30 min spaces only.",

Be ready to get messy but well worth it.   I had the Oxtail Fried Rice which was very different but at the same time pretty damn good. The taste profile was spot on.

None of the food we've ever ordered had failed us. It's either phenomenal or at least above average.  Food that we felt were extraordinary: Pho'getti, Steak & Eggs (shaken beef and tomato rice, omg, I never knew it could be so good), their special raw oysters of the day, Garlic Noodles.  Food that my guests felt was extraordinary, but I didn't really feel that way: Live Whole Maine Lobster Pho, Oxtail Fried Rice.  Food that we always order because it goes great with beer and because we trust the food and taste quality here: Garlic Fries, Chicken Wings, Grilled Whole Squid, Fish Tacos.  Other food we tried that were delicious and beyond average, but not something I necessary go back for: All their pho is really good, Fried Calamari.  Their prices are on the pricier side, but it is worth it once in a while.  My only complaint is that no matter how many times I ask, they just don't carry ranch.  I get it, you know.  Vietnamese restaurants don't normally carry ranch condiments, and they probably are a little anal about the way their food should taste and don't want people to ruin it with ranch.  And maybe that's what makes this place so stable and reliable in their food.  I always know what to expect.  But c'mon...  You have fries and chicken wings, why not ranch?  Sometimes all I want is bar food, and that's why I want that ranch.  Well, one time, I brought my own ranch and they were okay with it.  Lol!  When it comes down to it, we really come to this place because we love the atmosphere.  Yes, the amazing food keeps us coming back, but it's the service, the people, and the atmosphere that makes us feel comfortable and right at home.",

The oxtail pho was not one of the specials , but it's reasonably priced especially for the amount of sleep you get, can easily feed two people...  I think he's found a new place to come for his oxtail soup...  Since it was 109 degrees that day, I chose the oxtail fried rice. So good!! Didn't have a chance to try any desserts this time.

    "text": "Initially I was going to try Pho Basa last week, however they were closed for the day.  Lucky for me, District One was open and YELP suggested I go there.  Okay!  We arrive and the servers are friendly and seat us fairly quickly.  We're told it's happy hour and that's just awesome.    Being an Asian Fusion restaurant, their menu items all intrigued me.  I tried the Yellowtail fish tacos off their HH menu and OMG these were amazing.    Though appearing quite small when they serve the two tacos to you, the flavor of the yellowtail, avocado, cilantro, cherry tomato, and lime was out of this world.   I wanted to get 2 more orders of these.. but alas, I had to try other things.  The shrimp papaya salad was good.   It would have been great if it came with those flat shrimp chips that I've been used to back in Chicago.   Something to balance out the tanginess of the dish.  They must really know how to make very good pork belly because we ordered it two ways and both dishes were fantastic.  The pork belly in the steamed buns were yummy, bite size treats.  The other dish, Slow-Braised Pork Belly in young coconut juice was just so soft and tender and it came sitting in the sauce w/ a boiled egg as well.    There were plenty more unique offerings to try and they also offered a variety of Pho/Soups on the menu.  One thing I'll come back to try some time is their Lobster Pho.  I keep hearing about it and I want it!  Our experience here was good.  The service was fast.  And the food was delicious!  5/5.",

    "text": "First meal in Vegas!  Meh.  Good Morning Vietnam - their rendition of a Bloody Mary.  This was Pinky's drink and he wasn't a fan, well I guess I wasn't too much of a fan either just because I felt like I was drinking super concentrated V8.  A good bartender will make a good Bloody Mary with a perfect balance of flavors, not too strong in alcohol, not overwhelmed in spices, and not too thick and tomatoey.  I have to say, that although I appreciated the shrimp inside the Bloody Mary, it did nothing to tone down the thick consistency of the actual drink.  While the truffle salt I guess gets A for effort to make this drink exciting, but meh.. could have done without it.    Shigoku oysters - was excited for our oysters, but decided to just try 2 before ordering anymore since they said they served it with caviar and some ponzu type sauce.  Nice presentation, but what a waste of a good oyster.  Sorry, but the sauce that they flooded those little shells with totally killed off the natural flavor of the oyster.  I could only feel the texture of the oyster, but the taste was all sauce.  So happy we didn't order anymore.    Scallop sashimi - they served the scallop meat cut into thin slices with the ponzu and caviar with the more heartier, crunchier parts (I think the organs?) in the center.  Like the oysters the delicate flavor of the scallop was overwhelmed by the ponzu, but the crunchy bits actually went well with the sauce.  Pinky appreciated the crunchy bits of scallop and ended up finishing the order.  Green papaya salad - I liked this dish, it wasn't overly sweet like I had thought it would be, but it actually would have been tastier with a little more sweetness.  The salad reminded me of Thai papaya salad minus the strong fermented fish sauce flavor and scent (which I love btw).  the salad was refreshing and light, but I could have used more potent and pungent flavors.  Only downside was that the dish was supposed to come with pork, but when we got it there was only shrimp.  Initially I thought that maybe I had just read the menu wrong, but then our waiter came up with another bowl of salad but with all pork in it to make up for the mistake.  It wasn't a big deal... but just kind of weird how they remedied the situation.  But oh well, it was a win for Pinky bc he packed the pork salad up and ate it as a late night snack later on.     Lobster pho - price is marked as MP, we paid $40 for the bowl.  Noodles were cooked perfectly!  The lobster meat was sweet and the little brain/guts in the head were deliciously enjoyed by yours truly.  The broth itself was on the milder side... Honestly I had low expectations for this dish, but it actually surpassed them.  HOWEVER, I wouldn't order this dish again and $40 for it.  Maybe I'm just not a big enough fan of lobster to do it... but after my bandwagon-y instagram picture post of the dish, I'm over it.    Service was awesome, and the menu items go well with the cool atmosphere of Vegas... Might even do well in LA where theres a bunch of hipsters, scene kids, bandwagonners, and unknowing mi trang.  But as for me, I'll stick to my mom and pop shop, bowls of dank pho broth.",

    "text": "This place is a hungover person's dream come True - Delicious bowls of pho in a room with low lighting and chill music muahahaah.  OXTAIL PHO (5/5) - with a price tag of $15.99, it's definitely the most expensive bowl of pho i've ever had, but am I crazy to say it was WORTH IT? I was a lil reluctant because some reviews here claimed the oxtail meat wasn't tender but mine was FALL OFF THE BONE, easy-peasy-to-eat tender. Abundance of meat! Flavorful broth! No complaints here.  OXTAIL FRIED RICE (5/5) - $15.99 - sampled a bite of my friend's order and it was YUMMMMMY. Very soft chunks of oxtail meat hugged by perfectly fried rice. Hefty portion size! No complaints here either.  THE BIG BONE SOUP - $17.99 - this is THE thing to order if you want something for the 'gram. The bones are RIDICULOUSLY gigantic. Keep in mind it does not include pho noodles, so if you order that on the side, it's an additional $5. Had a taste of my friend's order and it was indeed tasty and would please any bone marrow fan, but it's a dish to avoid if you want something that'd require minimal effort to eat.  VIET-CHELADA (5/5) - $8 - mmmmm tried a sip and it was delicious. Basically it's a Michelada with Vietnamese beer. Whatever they used to rim the glass was nommynommy savory and worth lickin' yo lips for.  VIETNAMESE COFFEE - just as a heads-up, they serve traditional Vietnamese drip coffee. If youza noob, wait for all the water to drip from the filter, then stir the coffee with the condensed milk at the bottom until it's all dissolved, and then pour into your cup of ice.   ! BONUS POINTS ! - the music played during my visit was A1 (mura masa and odesza vibes). - extremely extensive drinks menu, it's crazy. If I was a Vegas local, I'd see myself coming here often to hang out and slurp/munch the night away. - water refills by our server were oooooooooon point.  - surprised they didn't automatically charge gratuity for our party of 8! 18% was well deserved regardless.  OVERALL  - hungover or not, I'd mosdef come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. Their menu has a wide variety of both traditional and modernized Viet food to tickle anyone's fancy!",

We got half a dozen house special oysters, belly bun, yellowtail tacos and lobster pho. Oysters were yum. Need to go back during happy hour. The belly buns were also good the pork was very tender. The yellowtail Tacos tastes better with lime and sriracha so better add some. The lobster pho was heaven. The broth was great and the lobster was succulent. If I lived in the area I'd probably visit often.",

I took off a star because I thought it was a little pricey. It was all delicious! Our sever, Jason C., really made a positive impact on our experience. He made us feel like we were talking to a friend and was very accommodating.  I really wanted to try the beef bone soup. However, they were out of it by the time we arrived. According to our server, there were a lot of people who stopped by for Sunday lunch.  The fresh fish is charged per pound ($23.00 for our 1 1/4 pound of fish). The snapper we ordered was cooked with a delicious sweet and sour sauce service with white rice.  The calamari was a great sharing size. It comes with a mild spicy mayo sauce. The batter tasted a little heavier compared to other calamari I have tried. Still tasty!  The shrimp pho was fantastic and served in a good amount.  Overall, great experience. I would come here again!",

Oxtail pho (5/5): pretty good, has meat that falls off the bone . No need for sriracha or hoisen! The oxtail meat is super flavorable and easy to take off the bone.  Bone marrow soup (4.5/5): its so big! They also offered to help us deconstruct it so its easier to eat, so of course we accepted. It came back as a beautiful tendon marrow soup. The soup is similar to the oxtail pho soup but a little more fatty.  Definately stop here if you are near the area. The service is pretty nice, too. They give you gloves so you won't ger your hands messy but it was unnecessary for our meal.",

We started out eating two belly buns--yummy delicious jucy oh so flavorful baos with the right balance of flavors. I then had the double down with the short rib Chinese sausage and egg. It comes with this rice that is crispy at the edges the short ribs cooked perfectly with the flavorful burnt edges full of the wonderful barbeque flavors of the sauses cooked into the meat and bones--so good for sucking on!  The added sauce they give you added kick and the egg--of course I ordered it with a runny yolk--adds to the sauce and flavor. I can still taste this dish. It will linger in my food memory for years to come as one of the best dishes of all time. My husband had the pho Tai rib eye which was huge but he loved it!  We were much too full for dessert. But we left feeling like we found a hidden gem--LOVE this place!!!",

Though they had already closed the booth section for the night, they accomadated our request. The menu has something for everyone. And I love that they have vegetarian options. My parents had the \"five spice cornish game hen' with tomato rice and pickles vegetables. They loved it! My brother had the 'green papaya salad' with shrimp, pork, peanuts and basil. Salad was beautiful. With fresh vegetables and generous portions of shrimp and pork. He loved it! I had the \"shrimp skewers\" deep fried tagarashi. Bold delicious flavor. Fried to perfection. Huge pieces of shrimp. I also ordered the \"pho veggie\" with seasonal veggies, pho broth and rice noodles. The broth was so delicious and flavorful. It came out super hot, which I love.  I asked the owner for chili/ hot sauce for my pho. He asked if I wanted something with more heat. I said yes! He went to the kitchen and sliced fresh red chilis for me. They also came around enough to check to see if you need anything else.  I will definitely be back to this establishment when in Las Vegas. They take pride in their food and service. From the ambience to the service to the food, everything was perfect. Perfect ambience. Perfect service. Pefect good quality and taste.",

    "text": "I came here on a weekday and it wasn't that busy. We were seated right away.  Service was so slow, took a while to get our orders. And our waters. Halfway thru the meal we asked for more water and the waiter took our cups away and never brought it back!  We ordered what they're famous for. Lobster pho: flavor was really good, had good seafood meets beef flavor. The only issue was it was a sodium bomb! Leaves you thirsty for days! And it was $50 a bowl before tax and tip! At least the lobster was big. Ox tail fried rice: not enough ox tail meat to justify the price. Flavor was good but again with the salt! Super salty! I think the chefs probably smoke too much and have killed their tastebuds.  It's better to have more pure flavor than it is to mask it with salt.  When it came to ask for the check we had to ask three different people and still didn't get our check! So we just paid at the front cashier and left no tip. It was over $70 for two dishes.  Maybe I might come back and try their other dishes if I have a friends visiting that really wanna eat here but I'm not sure, I think it's a lot of salt to eat in one meal.",

This was my first time having lobster Pho and District One has set a very high bar! They did not skimp on the lobster at all and the broth was very flavorful!   The Restaurant was clean and modern. The bar looked delectable and I will partake on girls night out! The staff were friendly and attentive. I will be returning!",

    "text": "After tonight, I'm not sure what the most interesting restaurant in this plaza is.  Mountain View Plaza on Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn is home to other great restaurants such as Asian BBQ & Noodles and Chada Thai and Wine. I finally made a long overdue visit to District One to hang out with old friends. Per their web site, their name is inspired by the old \"epicenter for entertainment and dining\" in yestercentury Saigon, but their cuisine is a fusion of Vietnamese with other Asian cuisines and American flavors. Still, I was definitely able to spot the Vietnamese influence in a lot of dishes.  \"Happiest Hours\" are Mon-Fri 5-7pm and Sun-Thu 12am-2am, and we hit the sweet spot of the normal happy hour, so a lot of our dinner consisted of sharing those items:  Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio ($9.99 Happiest Hours / $11.99 regular): beef, citrus soy, sesame & truffle oil, crispy white onion, crushed peanut. The beef pieces are considerably thicker than your average carpaccio, but they weren't too difficult to chew. Fortunately, the truffle oil was used judiciously, so I enjoyed the overall combination of varied flavors and textures.  Belly Buns (2 pc, $3.99 HH / $7.99 reg): braised pork belly, pickled carrot and daikon, cilantro, crushed peanut. Not sold on the supposed presence of cilantro, but the pork belly is prepared a la \"xa xiu\" (aka char siu, aka BBQ pork). In combination with the slaw, it really evokes the flavor profile of banh mi. Execution was inconsistent in that the meat in the encore order lacked fat and consequently seemed drier, but the first order was bursting with juices, and the happy hour price is stellar.  Cajun Garlic Fries ($2.99 HH, not on reg menu?): french fries, fresh crushed garlic, cajun seasoning. The garlic was far more prominent than the cajun spices, which is fine with me. These seasonings were uneven over the plate, but they were really addictive, and it was feasible to cobble together enough from the spillage. Ketchup can cover for that issue too. Also, it's a very nice portion compared to enhanced french fries at other restaurants.  (An interesting food hack that one friend used was to dip fries in the leftover beef carpaccio sauce. I've got to try that next time.)  House Special Oysters ($19.99 for 12): ponzu, caviar. We got this instead of the fresh oyster, which is $1.25 per oyster HH. For the small increase in average-per-oyster price, the ponzu and caviar put an interesting spin on what could have been mundane lemon and cocktail sauce oysters. A small quibble is that the oysters were a bit on the small side, but that's easily solvable with a second order...  Crispy Egg Rolls (4 pc, $4.99 HH, $6.99 reg): pork, mushroom, taro. The overall flavor was really good, especially with the dipping sauce. However, I'm sure most people will agree that there is far too much taro compared to the other parts of the filling. I barely had a problem on this occasion, but my ideal is a more meat-focused egg roll. I would avoid it as a silent protest of sorts, but you should try it once if you haven't.  Fish Tacos (2 pc, $4.99 HH / $9.99 reg): sashimi yellowtail, avocado, cilantro, cherry tomato, serrano pepper in a crispy shell. One of my favorite bites of the night. This does not remind me of anything in Vietnamese cuisine. It's more like the seafood tostadas offered by Soho Japanese Restaurant, This rendition has a medley of flavors, especially when you squeeze the lime wedge into the taco. I enjoyed the reorder of this dish, so I have to rank it above the Belly Buns.  Serrano Pepper Wings ($0.50 each HH, $7.99 reg for ? pc): deep fried wings, supposedly in serrano pepper sauce... wait, what sauce? Yeah, I'm going to ignore that odd description. These are moist, properly seasoned wings - a welcome relief after the relative disaster at Chow in downtown Las Vegas. The crust and flavors remind me of my dad's delicious recipe. Be prepared for the mild inconvenience of having to scoop up the serrano pepper slices and the green onion pieces to flavor variety.  Oxtail Fried Rice ($12.99): shredded oxtail meat, red onion, soy sauce, fried egg (sunny side up). This dish is fairly tame on its own, but it sings glorious harmonies in your mouth when you add a bit of Sriracha sauce. The sweetness, acidity, and heat in the ever-increasingly popular condiment perfectly complement the flavors of the fried rice. It's puzzling that the flavors aren't already in the fried rice recipe, but I don't care after how delicious it was. The only issue is that the oxtail didn't stand out for me. It could have been subbed out for any other reasonable protein.  I truly enjoyed District One. I was impressed with most of what I tried and the happy hour pricing, and nothing was overly disappointing. Come here for HH and bring friends. Perhaps you can enjoy Monday Night Football on the myriad of TV screens as we did. I can't speak for the rest of the menu just yet, but I'm excited to return to explore it.",

    "text": "Came here after a long day and was seated almost immediately even though a crowd. Once seated we were served drinks and left the menu to look through.   I ordered the oxtail pho and came to realization it was also happy hour so I ordered the porkbelly buns (fried)... needless to say it was amazing. I've always had steamed buns but having it fried was no comparison to the unhealthier version.  The food arrived all together, I immediately tried the oxtail pho and it was so tender and soft to the bite. And also had the very crispy spring rolls which wasn't too hot on the inside so I was able to power through the appetizer.  In the end, I was very satisfied with my decision to eat here and will definitely bring friends and family here because the ambience is great and not too loud even though there's a sports bar. 5 stars all the way",

My boyfriend order the crispy bird nest noodles and I ordered the slow cooked pork belly w/ coconut juice. Both dishes were very tasty. I was surprised the bird nest stayed crispy not soggy when you put the wet ingredient on it.  The pork belly had flavored but i think to overwhelming for me cause the juices tasted like fish sauce to me.  Service was slow. Don't get me wrong it wasn't busy but I would expect to have someone be more attentive if it wasn't busy to check on the table to see how were doing or even give more water without out us waving someone down.Over all food was good, I would come back and try there lobster pho.",

Hate to be so blunt but If this restaurant were in Orange County, it may last for about 6 months at most.  Ordered the lobster pho. It was totally bland and devoid of any True pho flavor. 50$?! I was totally confused.  The presentation was nice tho. The big bone soup was similarly bland. However the meat and marrow from the bones were tasty. We also ordered the ox tail fries. The fries were loaded with meat and gravy. Good value but again, not much with taste.  The service was good. People were friendly and helpful. The food came out quickly.  the ambience was nice.  Im glad I did try this place as the concept is good and novel.  However, I would not come back I have to wonder if the chef is truly Vietnamese or familiar with how pho should taste. Maybe they had a bad batch of the broth. Having read through some of the other reviews, I see others thought similarly about the blandness of the broth.  Sorry, This place missed the mark.",

We stopped the waiter to ask and he admitted that the do use a lot of MSG. I wouldn't mind so much if it was written on the menu so that I would have had the choice to avoid it. I'm sure the reason the food tastes so good is bc it is altered so much with MSG.....if you're sensitive to it, or prefer not to consume it....this place wouldn't be my first choice.",

Only 4 tables were occupied and there were 4 servers so to have great customer service shouldn't have been an issue. We were seated by a window and it took about 5 minutes to get a server to help us. When we started looking around for help a gentlemen came to our table with waters, and as he was about to leave I told him we were ready to order. He didn't seem very friendly and as I said thank you he just walked away..  We ordered 2 oxtail loco mocos, one fish taco, and a spring roll. The food was alright. Definitely different, but the taste was just alright. Especially for the small 3 fish tacos with barely any yellowtail, it's bit overpriced.   Maybe I'll come back and give it another try. With a different server and different items on the menu.",

I found District One and I really loved their twist on common asian and Vietnamese dishes. I ordered the Garlic Noodles with thinly sliced cuts of beef. It was served hot and fresh and it was delicious with just the right blend of garlic flavor and of course, the noodles were perfectly al-dente. They have a Vietnamese Iced Coffee that will bring you right out of a hangover - or perhaps even a coma. The waitresses and staff are all first-rate and extremely professional. I'll be visiting again next time, especially since my party was served fast and the bill was totally reasonable considering the amount of food and alcohol that was ordered. Unfortunately, I was the DD on this trip so I didn't get to enjoy any of the drinks, but everyone said the bar here is top-notch and the Vietnamese Donkey (it's a drink) was awesome.",

A slight fishy taste didn't stop me from enjoying the tiny fish tacos. The wonton shell added some great crunch to the sashimi yellowtail. The fanny bay oysters provided a balance of sweetness to the salinity of the oysters and caviar on top, with a touch of heat that trailed at the end. The beef carpaccio was unfortunately drowning in sauce. Half the amount would have been plenty to make the beef, onions and peanuts shine. My favorite item was the pork belly buns. The deep fried buns were a nice contrast to the standard chewy bao buns. And, of course, pork belly never disappoints. No Vietnamese restaurant is complete without pho. Their pho tai rib eye is plenty big enough for two to share, with a wonderfully aromatic broth covering a large mound of noodles and beef.",

For a small Asian restaurant they have very good wines on their list at a very reasonable markup.  Their food is definitely a mix of items that are traditional and \"new\", but everything was prepared really well.  We opted for the special Kauai fried/grilled shrimp was were really tasty head on Santa Barbara prawn sized shrimp with some chili sprinkles.  I had the Hue noodle soup which had a very fragrant and spicy broth that hit the spot for me.  The beef salad was also really good.  I would say the only thing that was just ok were the oysters.  They weren't bad but there was nothing special about them at all.    Another restaurant added to my regular LV Chinatown list!   BTW, this plaza is FILLED with great places.  Another one of my favorite places is Shaanxi Gourmet a few doors down. Q Bistro next door is pretty decent for big portions and food to eat with your beer!",

    "text": "I came here on the recommendation of a friend and was absolutely blown away with my experience: First and foremost, district one is a Vietnamese-based restaurant with a wonderful variety of traditional dishes but it's also a nice bar with a hip decor suitable for a first date or watching a game with friends.  I tried the four dishes: Vietnamese carpaccio which was melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious Cabbage and shredded chicken salad - this is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes and this one was the best I've ever eaten. It was clearly made to order with the mint still being crispy and nothing feeling soggy or stagnant. I'm hungry even thinking about it and I ate it a week ago.  Clay pot - this was a hearty and savory comfort food which was delicious but not as light as the other two Sauteed water spinach with tofu - perfectly cooked, not overly oily, the perfect amount of garlic and delicious.   I would highly recommend this place for locals as a restaurant or as a bar which happens to have fantastic food. I would also recommend it to Las Vegas visitors who want a temporary escape from the strip and it's blinding lights. I think Vegas should have uber by my next visit and I'll make it a point to return to district 1.",

If you haven't gone to China Town in Las Vegas, this is a great place for westerners learning about Asian food. The staff is friendly and the menu is in English.  As an attorney who works regularly with Chinese lawyers and clients, I have been to numerous establishments in China Town and I believe this is the best place for Pho, fish, and Fusion foods.",

Oxtail fried rice was delicious , steaming hot and fresh with an over easy fried egg on top.  The spring rolls are also a great appetizer 2 rolls cut in half for 4 total pieces a good value appetizer for $5.99.  Enjoyed several wings next visit during their happy hour along with some tasty beers. Sat at the bar late night, very friendly male bartender and did a great job with our group of four.  Third visit was a phoned in Carryout. Must say I was disappointed.  Portions were smaller than the portions when I had dined in with the fried rice and especially the garlic vegetable blend.  When I opened the to go container, I thought it was a joke, barely half full with veggies . For $11 at a local place like this I find it unacceptable. At Joel Robuchon I would expect it, not here!  I almost wanted to drive back and question the portion,  don't have time for that. Previous two dine in visits were great that's why I had returned.  Come on District One , veggies are the cheapest , in your unfair portion it would have cost me $22 if not more to fill a to go box with sauteed veggies :(   please see photo I posted  I hope you address this and change it accordingly",

We ordered from the happy hour menu - egg roll, pork belly steam bau, garlic fries, spicy wings, oysters and carpacio. Fries came cold - we had to send them back. Egg rolls and pork bao weren't much better. Drinks were weak - at one point they wanted the martini glass as they had run out - it was about a third full. Overall the food wasn't that great - we also ordered from the regular menu - pho gau, chicken clay pot (rice undercooked and sauce very salty). The table next to us seemed to be having a better meal - with the owners personally checking in periodically and delivering the food, which looked piping hot and a lot better than what we got. With food options available, I doubt I will come back.",

Upon entry the hostess wasn't very welcoming nor she smiled. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Went there during happy hour to catch some food and drink specials, not a whole lot of selection on HH food really but at least the HH beers were good. It was interesting to see so many servers for such a small place or maybe some of them were bussers? I couldn't really tell, they had the same uniforms. Anyway wasn't sure if they all shared sections because we had at least 4-5 different employees coming to check up on us. It was just weird that when we needed service no one came to us but when we didn't need service they all came around. Hmm maybe just a bad rotation or circulation on the floor. Oh well at least they were friendly. The highlight of the experience was the white buns wrapping the pork belly. Tacos was alright. Papaya salad with the shrimp was okay, great portion for the price but it definitely wasn't fresh. You get what you pay for I guess. I need to come here outside of HH and try other things on the menu and I'm sure my second experience will be better then. Good music btw!!",

The whole squid. I prefer my squid to be tender, my friend likes the chewiness... District One's rendition was on the very chewy side. I could have gotten over that, but it was also brought out cold. Chewy cold squid is definitely not appetizing. I finished all the little burnt tenticles which the flavor was on point, but definitely a miss.   Oxtail Pho. Thank you for the delicious oxtail pho. This was just how we liked and hoped it would be! They have all the traditional pho toppings and tools on each table, including your own roll of paper towels.  Service was also a bit slow. We will probably continue eating at District One due to their late hours & convenience, but wish they would step their game up a bit.",

Both soups were extremely salty for my liking (so salty it made ME salty). Go ahead and call me extra but I had to add water... we waited pretty long for both soups too and they didn't even come together at the same time. We came around 3 pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all. I got mine first and the bf waited an extra ten mins. Both pho had barely any noodles. I purposely didn't order a starter because I assumed I'd be getting a decent amount of noodles. I also ordered a matcha Thai tea because the tap water tasted nasty too. That also didn't impress me. Overall super disappointed but glad I tried it to get it off my mind.",

I have ordered that before and it was great. Do expect to pay a price for it though, because each order comes with a whole lobster.   For appetizers, make sure you get the oxtail fries. This is a great dish especially with the sunny side up egg on top. I will normally order the oxtail pho or the bone marrow pho. The broth here is pretty good. Very clean. They cook the oxtails down until the just fall of the bone.  If you're up for a drink, try the Hennessey Cafe Sua Da. Never would I have thought Hennessey would pair perfectly with Vietnamese coffee.",

They put mint leaves in there, but it wasn't overbearing. Just gave it a nice refreshing kick. Also they fried a piece of egg roll or wonton skin and rolled it up in the spring roll, so it also gave it a nice crunch. Loved this!   The fish tacos were a miss. Yellowtail sashimi with guacamole, tomatoes. I generally like the taste of sashimi and don't need it doled up with a lot of flavors. But even the flavors they added just covered up whatever flavor the fish had, and the whole thing was just lacking in flavor. Maybe put more like lime in it, or sweet pickled onions.   Pho was good - flavorful broth, good amoun of beef, and noodles cooked well.   Viet iced coffee - delicious!!!   The service was friendly, and prompt. I loved the decor of the restaurant too - kind of like a hip bar, where you can watch sports (lots of tvs), and beer and alcoholic beverages.   My only complaint is that I wish they included more Asian drinks like boba, or viet desserts with the coconut milk and grass jelly.",

Sadly...the service was disorganized & nonexistent. The servers were very nice & when ours was present he was helpful but we spent more time waiting for him then we did speaking with him. Additionally, our food was run out by different people at different times - I was practically finished with my bowl of Pho when they brought the veg plate out for it. But the biggest disappointment of the evening: PARKING!  There was none. I parked in the shopping center next to it and walked; my friends parked across Jones & played Frogger trying to cross. This isn't the best area at 7pm on a Saturday night. It doesn't change for the better at 9pm.   The menu District One has on their website is wrong. I had my heart set on lobster pho when I arrived but when I found out 1) the menu online is wrong and 2) the price was more than whats online I couldn't justify it.   I really wanted something different so went with the rib eye pho. OMG is was delicious. Lots of noodles, perfect broth & the rib eye melted in my mouth. I hate going to Chinatown but I will just for this.   Spring rolls were disappointing. Bland. Too much mint. Not sure what the crunchy pork was inside the roll. These are traditionally made with the pork and shrimp on the outside of the roll visible through the rice paper. And nowhere near the amount of mint crammed into this. It had absolutely no flavor and the peanut sauce wasn't about to help change it.    Oxtail pho I heard was gorgeous, too.   Shrimp skewers weren't cooked through. My friend is an idiot and doesn't send food back so she literally threw $8 away. ($3.99/each)  Came here for my birthday and overall I was very pleased. Will definitely come back...but not at 7pm on a Saturday night.",

When we have visitors in town, District One is usually on the short list of local spots to recommend and check out.  Last night, the service was just not that good.  I think I had to step out of our booth 4-5 times to ask for assistance throughout our time there.  I'm a pretty patient person, but this wasn't cool.  Kudos to you all on the food last night, but the service last night was a sure thumbs down.",

I would say it reminded me of boiling crab but definitely a more upgrade version. The tables were quite spacious which is a huge plus for me. The service was mediocre, I wished they were a little more attentive but I don't blame them since they were getting ready to close.  For appetizer we went with their oxtail fries. The fries were on the salty side. I probably won't recommend them unless you really like salt! As for entrees my friends and I decided to try their pho. Usually when I order pho tai I like my meat on the side because I hate overcooked meat. However, I decided to leave it in my soup. My friend requested to have his meat on the side.  When we got our noodles, I noticed the soup wasn't really hot. My meat was still pink after 8 minutes! It wasn't even medium rare it was RAW. As for my friend his meat was just plain not cooked. We asked if we could have our phos reheated. They gave us a bowl of hot broth instead which was fine with us.  Overall, I never experienced pho like this before. I definitely wouldn't recommend my friends or family to try this place.",

My friend and I had a great meal, sampling several dishes, Service was much better this time around as well.   Ordered: slow braised pork belly in young coconut juice. This was divine! 5/5 the king crab legs in a garlic type sauce. A bit tough because the crab wasn't broken open as much but nevertheless good. 4/5 Beef and lemongrass wrapped in Betel leaves....so much flavor. 4/5 Mekong River Soup - my friend had this and she liked it. I couldn't sample it because she added plenty of peppers.   Overall this was really a fun, delicious meal. We were there around 4pm on a Friday, so it wasn't busy but soon got packed with more people for happy hour. It was quite the improvement from my first time, which is why I felt the need to update this review.",

I come from an area where Vietnamese restaurants, specifically Pho restaurants, are very prominent. In my opinion, District One exceeded all of them, and I can confidently say that I had some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever tried there. We ordered the surf and turf pho (half lobster with beef), the coconut fatty pork with rice, oxtail fries, and pork jowl skewers. The jowl skewers were outta this world good (especially with freshly sprinkled lime juice), oxtail fries were flavorful and smokey, and surf and turf pho featured delicate, fresh lobster, tender beef, and ultra rich broth. Would highly recommend anyone to try this place if they are around the area.",

But I think that with the nice atmosphere and the friendly staff, my food tasted so good. Especially the incredible crispy and delicious chicken wings! At other Pho places I normally order Pho Dat Biet but I never eat the tripe and when I am here, I always order Pho Tai Nam, which is perfect because it's a combination bowl basically, without the tripe. Meant to be!  Their Happiest Hours Monday-Friday are from 5pm-7pm and Sunday-Thursday 12am-2am.  At about 1am there was hardly anyone at the restaurant but when I came here to eat again it was packed at about 8pm!

This place also has a full bar which they ask you when you arrive, if you want a table, booth or bar seating.  I personally did not get it but the I did taste and the broth is very flavorful. For $45 a bowl, I am not sure if it was worth it only because it  seemed very skimp on the noodles. The meat is already out of the shell for you so all you get is the lobster meat and a little bit of noodles.  Yes, it is a must try, but again...no unless you win big at a casino and can afford it and only like a little bit of noodles.   I had the Bun Bo Hue, which I personally thought it lacked flavor. My bowl came out first. Traditionally you wait till everyones food is out before you can start eating. We must have waited another 15 minutes for the lobster pho to come so my bowl sat there luke warm, but the waitress was nice enough to bring me out a bowl of hot steaming broth that was packed full of flavor. Maybe what I got was not the best choice but the pictures and reviews from other looked really good.",

They were really small and there's barely any squid. the fish tacos just taste like avocado and lettuce. The pho was alright. I would of enjoyed it more if there weren't 10 guys drinking and being super loud right in front of us. Still have a headache from that. Wouldn't try it again, it kind of reminded me why not to go out to eat. The customer service is very nice tho A+ on that. Other than that I was disappointed to spend our anniversary there.",

    "text": "Based on a Yelper friends review, I had this place in mind since I Love Vietnamese food. I have to say it didn't quite meet all my expectations, but when you consider all the elements: food, ambiance, service, and price, I would agree that District One is not bad.   Loved the ambiance (lots of room, not much waiting, good for large groups). Service was good.   The food had mixed reviews in our group. Me personally, I thought both the chicken pho and lobster pho were delicious - the broth packed in the flavor. I also like the rice combo dish. We choose kalbi, which included a side of lop chong sausage and sunny side up egg. Disliked: not a fan of their papaya salad nor the fresh spring rolls. I also didn't care for the vodka mule drink, nor the coconut cocktail.   Stick to beer or wine, play it safe.   Otherwise not a bad place to meet up with friends.   I still think my little hole in the wall mom n pop Vietnamese place would run circles around this place as far as food goes. But ...this is a better fun hang out choice, in my opinion.",

Nothing special in the broth to make it tastier than any other Vietnamese pho place ... The oxtail fried rice was extremely tasty ... It had that wok fragrant flavor which is usually only obtained by an experienced season chef! I'll order that again ... I wish I had a bigger stomach so that I can try some of the specials",

Because I have a very strict diet the restaurant was very accommodating to switching a few things out and replacing it with stuff I was able to eat. The pork chop itself was very juicy. The side of beef was good but I thought it was a little too salty.   The best dish I would recommend would be the beef carpaccio. It was perfectly marinated with the right amount of lime and basil.   If you have dogs I highly recommend the oxtail soup. The soup itself was surprisingly not salty like how I've had in other restaurants. The oxtail was a bit hard to eat but the marination of it was amazing. The meat would just fall off the bone.   FYI. The parking in that center is horrible!",

Appetizer finally comes out. 30 min later the phos come out, but she brings oxtail pho instead of lobster. Beef ball pho is fine but she doesn't bring any of the topping veggies so we sit for a while again. One member of our group is pescatarian so she can't eat it. After making this many mistakes our server doesn't make eye contact with us anymore. Manager explains that they're busy and doesn't seem to realize the server never put out order in in the first place. The food was good and the manager gave us 2 complimentary desserts, but we're not coming back. 2 hours for pho is beyond ok.",

The Belly Buns were delicious and so were the Beef Lemongrass Skewers (love that the lemongrass stick was encompassed by the beef in order to enhance the flavor).

    "text": "My Dad, husband and myself all ate here Wednesday evening.  I wish I remembered out servers name as she was very nice.  She pointed out to us that it was happy hour for a bit longer and so we ordered the wings, pork belly buns and egg rolls.  The egg rolls were standard, the wings I expected to be saucy but it was more like fried chicken, and I did enjoy the pork belly bun even though I must warn you it was very fatty and one is more then enough if you don't usually eat foods that rich!  Also, I could only stand to eat one wing because it was so greasy.  I reeeally wished the wings were saucy and not greasy.  I also had the pho which was very good.  The food runners forgot our tables limes, basil and sprouts so we were almost finished when we asked our server if they served limes and she went and got them.  My Dad ordered the bone marrow with noodles and I think he was very happy.  He said not to get them if you are ever on a date because it is so messy!  The server gave him a few wet naps, plastic gloves and I think a bib to help with the mess, but it was still messy.  I think my Dad enjoyed it even though it looked like he was Fred Flintstone eating a Brontosaur.  The server wrapped one of the bones up for my dog and my dog also loved it!  I liked eating here.  It wasn't the best ever but I'm sure I can find more on the menu I would like better.  I saw other people here with coconuts with straws in them and I wanted one but was too full by then!",

    "text": "My friend and I tried out this restaurant about a week ago.  We both liked the atmosphere, decorations, etc...However...we both were disappointed. The reasoning behind the three stars is that they completely forgot us.  We ordered an appetizer to start off with which we got.  When it was time to order our entree, we were forgotten. It was almost an hour when our waitress came up to us and asked us if we wanted dessert and we told her we didn't even eat yet.  She looked at us like we were joking.  We told we were not and told her we didn't receive our food yet.  Throughout the ordeal, our waitress also failed to tell us that my friend's order ran out.  Why couldn't they have told her that sooner than later when we nearly waited almost an hour for our food.  So my friend had to re-order and ended up getting the Oxtail Pho instead.  The reason we were forgotten, a few large parties had come in and that's why we were forgotten.  It's unacceptable! Just because a large party had come in, you catered to them first when we were already there hours on and haven't eaten yet.  We finally got our food, after nearly going on now for two hours of waiting.  I sent mine back because it was filled with onions.  I had them to take it off.  After all of this mess, it was quite pretty funny how they kept checking up on us every minute and second when the staff nearly forgot us for hours.  My friend and I were not impressed how they handled this mess.  To top it off, we were billed at the end and all we got was a big apology.  So at this point, going back to District One not for awhile until they figure out how to fix a mess like this because it can happen to anyone as well.",

    "text": "This place hands down is the best pho I have ever tasted! I'm from Northern Virginia and we have a lot of places known for their pho so when I say it was amazing... it truly was amazing. It did not disappoint!!!  My hubby's friend introduced us to this place and he is from Northern Virginia originally as well so we automatically trusted his tastes buds when he said this place was awesome and it really was delicious here lol  To me, Pho is the best hangover cure ever! It is what I look for the day after partying hard and needing some soup in my belly lololz  I loved the oxtail pho here and the portions are just HUGE!  Dont be shy to suck on them bones! It has all that flavor and meat stuck in between em!   I also got the coconut water which comes inside a young coconut with the coconut flesh inside of it too. They give you a long teaspoon to get the flesh out and that coconut water is definitely a hangover remedy for sure as well!  We also got the oxtail fried rice. It was to die for! I was so blown away by the flavor packed into the rice snd the oxtail was seasoned perfectly before being thrown into the pan to fry along side of the rice as well.   The hubs and I came here twice during our Vegas trip! Definitely well worth coming down here from the strip.   Highly recommend the place!",

We had 30 mins to order before it ends.  Ordered half dozen oysters, papaya salad, eggrolls, bao pork.  Oysters and bao pork were delish and yummy!!!  I would def order more next time in town!  Papaya salad and eggrolls was ok.  Now to the main course:  Infamous Oxtail Fried Rice- yes it was flavorful but way too much fatty meat!  Pho Tai Nam- broth was good.    Overall not bad place.  Would def come back during happy hours and pho!",

This place is great. Open for THANKSGIVING. Yes, thank you, my fellow hardworking Vietnamese people! I was shocked when they were, but since I had no plans and no family around, here was my opportunity to have a feast on my own.   The dishes I've had: Got the Japanese oysters to start and they were of course very good (not my first rodeo).  Cornish hen rice dish Bun bo hue (I think it was named spicy soup on the menu)  Bird's nest Lobster fried rice Bo luc lac salad  Some veggie dish   Everything is great. The Cornish hen is so crispy and juicy. It's not that dry, but it does lack flavor. I basically used all of my fish sauce that it came with. But the rice is great too - it's not super easy making that rice right.   Spicy soup is great, but don't expect it to taste like traditional bun bo hue.   Bird's nest - fun, crispy noodles with stir fried veggies. Good, but I'd never get again.   Lobster rice: yummmm but it's pricey. I've had better, but this one is solid, though on a bit on the oily side.   The menu is smaller than general viet places but it's good. I don't think a lot can go wrong.   Service is ok - not rude like usual Asian places, but not on the ball either. A full bar is offered, so you can drink away and it's a GREAT place to watch sports. They have a ton of tha everywhere with the latest games, so you can watch the cowboys whip butt. (But more likely be whipped...) Get out of the strip and make it to district one where you'll be able to find a table, get a drink, and enjoy some pretty good eats!",

I'll just say ahead of time that the speciality dishes were excellent, but on another trip, there are a lot of other things I'd like to try. There were four of us, and we were hungry. We started with the Belly Buns. I'd have them again. They melted in your mouth, and had great flavor. We got the whole Maine Lobster Pho. Very elegant, and somewhat subtle. There was enough to share around if we were careful. We then shared the Big Bone Broth. This thing is a monster, although there isn't as much as it looks. Once the truly big bones are removed it's reasonably sized. Although, the flavors were outsized, and there was plenty of good marrow. It was a great take on Pho. Finally, we had the Five Spice Cornish Hen. This was perhaps the actual highlight. Complex, good flavors, unlike what I normally associate with a Pho restaurant. The place was noisy with quite a few people watching a football (soccer) game and sharing their their thoughts regularly with cheers and hoots. You really felt you had left Vegas and moved temporarily to Vietnam compared to other places around Chinatown.",

However, the 2 stars only is because the waiters need more training. There were many of them but when we asked for some pepper, the first one ignored us completely and gave us one of those nasty look like \"why did you bother me?\" And no surprise, he did not bring out the pepper. It took three attempts to finally get the peppers, and when that arrived, we finished half the noodle soup already.  The young guys are generally very nice, the older guys look like they did not want to be there. One of the waiter spilled a copious amount of the soup he brought out. They just left it there to dry out on the floor. Is this good practice?",

This was a mistake on our end because it was a lot of rich food all at once, but it was worth the pain.   This is crazy, but I'm not big om Pho. D1 changed my opinion 100%. The flavors of the broth, the tenderness of the oxtail qnd the freshness of the ingredients was excellent.   I get nervous about pork belly because it is a big piece of fat, but wow. The pork belly tasted like butter, and the broth it was in, when you added the carrots and veggies was phenomenal. You can really tell this is slow cooked to perfection!  The short ribs? I ate these up like a cavewoman. Unreal how good they were. I've never bad short ribs at a restaurant because of my allergy and because most restaurants use normal soy sauce. I could not believe how good they were, and it came with Chinese sausage and pickled veggies which made it all happiness on a plate.   The next time we got the beef carpaccio, and just WOW. I could not believe have indanely good it was. There are no words. No words. Just eat it.   They use a gluten free soy sauce, so basically anything that isn't dusted is gluten free friendly which is great as well!  Great service, very reasonable prices, delicious drinks that aren't too sweet (try the Donkey Mule or 5 Pear), and a fun atmosphere. I will go here as often as I can! Definitely worth every penny and then some!",

Next door is q karaoke, cafe moda, and all the other fun stuff.  I usually come here at midnight or so when it's not too busy.  The servers are very quick and attentive, also very friendly! The food also comes out quick and always tastes bomb. I usually come here just for the garlic fries because they're that good.    Happy hour is the best time to come.  They have $4 shots (I always order Jameson with sweet tea), $3 garlic fries, tacos, etc.  I always order the oxtail pho and garlic fries.  I also tried the papaya salad, oxtail fried rice, wings, coconut ice cream, matcha drink, and garlic noodles.  They all taste amazing.  Besides the garlic fries being my favorite, I also recommend the coconut ice cream.  So good!!!!!! It's also in a coconut which makes I.t even better.  During happy hour we only spend $40-$60 with alcohol.  Nothing satisfies me more than garlic fries and Jameson.    This joint is really great for late night grub after karaoke, work, whatever it is.

I would have gladly paid more for VSOP.   The food: oxtail fried rice. Just do it. For the price, the taste makes it justifiable. SO flavorful and delicious.   Serrano hot wings were a bit on the salty/fishy side.  Over all it was a nice little place to go to get a pho fix . Like all places in Vegas, it was a little Over priced, but if it isn't over priced it wouldn't be Vegas. Lol",

We didn't have any trouble but we were there right when they opened for lunch.  Service was decent. They were friendly and checked up on us. They forgot 2 requests, but fixed it right away when we asked again.   For the food, my group ordered family style. I got to try some of their pork belly buns (fried and steamed), garlic noodles, and surf and turf pho, and I decided not to touch the other dishes.   We got 2 versions of the pork belly buns, but the star of the dishes was seriously lacking. It was mostly gelatinous fat instead of a nice balance. The surf and turf pho definitely had big pieces of lobster in it. It didn't make me feel like I was getting ripped off by the cost. I wasn't feeling the broth though. The basic garlic noodles were actually pretty good, probably my favorite of what I tried.   I wouldn't choose to come back based on what else Vegas has to offer, but I can see the draw for the Instagram crowd.",

Hubby said Oxtail Pho was good, but no wow factor. Belly buns were good, bread was really fluffy. Spring rolls were okay, but a little to minty for my personal taste (vermicelli), although the peanut sauce was amazing! Chicken clay pot was good but again, too strong with herb flavors. The coconut was great, I love coconuts so it was great, nice and cold.  Service was good, never felt forgotten and she was really nice. Atmosphere was very nice.",

Most of the time, I will eat at the Bacchanal Buffet or Bellagio Buffet because I have a family of picky eaters and we need a large selection of food to accommodate everyone. On my recent visit to Vegas, I was fortunate to accompany some friends to District One for lunch. I live in Orange County and we are surrounded by Asian Fusion food so I had my reservations about District One... However, when we entered the restaurant and met Vi, the Hostess, I immediately knew that I would have an awesome experience. She was passionate about her menu and specialty drinks and she went through the house specials with enthusiasm and confidence.  We found ourselves ordering the Vietnamese Donkey, Mandarin Splash and Vietnamese coffee for drinks. For appetizers and entrees, we had in no particular order, (1) Japanese oysters with house ponzu sauce, (2) jumbo fried shrimp, (3) seasoned squid, (4) fried snapper with papaya salad, (5) oxtail fried rice, (6) garlic noodles with sliced rib eye, (7) coconut ice cream with roasted peanuts on a coconut shell and (8) coconut creme brulee.  OMG, we ate all of this for lunch cause the menu was so enticing!!!  The food was absolutely delicious and I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in Vegas. There were so many more items that I want to taste so I will be back soon!",

There's definitely a lot of space during happy hour when I came in, which is always a good thing!   Service: 3 - They were good and attentive, but they are definitely prone to lots of mistakes. The servers should know what orders to put in first or the cooks should know which orders to crank out first. For example, we got our oxtail fries absolutely last at the end of our meal, which was odd. And I understand pho is easy to make, but you have to be smart about which orders you're putting out together. Other than this, service was pretty great!   Food: 3/4 - I would say that some food was a hit or miss. It's definitely a good idea to arrive during their happy hours. I thought the oxtail fries and serrano wings were so-so. Though, I did hear that their pho was good and I had that crispy bird's nest noodle dish, which was also pretty tasty. Probably my favorite thing of the night was the oysters and how much they cost during happy hour--a dollar an oyster! They were super fresh and a good size. Plus, they didn't have that \"just picked it from the ocean\" taste, which was really nice! I think I'll definitely come back for happy hours ;)",

    "text": "Wow!!! Thank you Aaron for your wonderful service and food suggestion. Aaron was very informative when asked questions about the menu. (09/01/14)  I didn't even know Las Vegas had a China Town in the City of lights. This is a must, place to visit! Take a break from the strip -- sun, drunk people and gambling.   My other half and I love to share our food. This is what we had:  -The wings- (Garlic Serrano Pepper) They were just cooked right and crispy. The sauce at the bottom of the tray was top notch! Very Juicy  -Belly Buns- (Pork Belly, Clintro & Peanut Sauce) The bun was so soft it just melted in my mouth, the peanut flavor was awesome. They didn't have so much fat on the meat! (A+ Plus)   -The 3 pound Garlic Lobster with noodles-- WOW! WOW! This was amazing! At first we thought 3 pound was going to be a lot of food, but at the end we devoured it! The noodles were very fresh and tender. The lobster was cooked just right. The seasoning was great and finger-licking good!   Dessert- O-mg-! The ice cream is to die for! They only have one flavor which is coconut -- served on a coconut shell.   The wait time to get our food was expectational! It took them about 10-15 to bring out the main dish and about 3-5 for the appetizers. I can't wait to go back! :)",

    "text": "This restaurant had amazing food, but we came with a very large group (about 16) and it was difficult for the service to keep up, which is why I cannot give them a 5.   They had some good prices for happy hour, which we caught an hour of. From the happy hour menu, the wings were good, the fries hot and tasty, the belly buns were very good, the mango salad was very big and refreshing, the eggrolls were my favorite, the carpaccio was an excellent delicious surprise, and the beer was good.   I also got the short ribs smothered fries with an egg on top and they were also very good. It was from their special menu described by the waiter. The portion was huge, but went fast at the table.   Even the cooks struggled, because the first thing I ordered was the garlic fries and they were the last thing to come out.   The waiter really struggled with the bill, but it was finally all worked out in the end. I also explained how disheartening it was to watch three staff standing around talking while our waiter was overwhelmed and we waited so long for refills and service. All the waiter could do was apologize.   Either way, I would definitely come back again. Maybe with a smaller group this time.",

    "text": "They are located in a plaza on the Southeast corner of Jones and Desert Inn near Icy Juicy (situated in Cravin' Cajun's old spot). The layout hasn't changed, however, it has new flair to suit District One. I really like all the decals on the back wall!  I came with a few Yelpers (The Q's, David V., and Paolo) and it was a new experience for most of us. We shared both of their chicken wings selections; Tamarind Wings ($6.95) and Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings ($6.95). The wings were fried without a batter and tossed/dressed in light sauces of their respective flavors. Both selections were bland, lacking a pinch of salt, however, the Garlic Serrano had great flavor potential. Without a batter, the wings lacked any type of crunch or bite. Additionally, the orders came with pickled vegetables (carrots and daikon) that were good! We also tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio ($10.95), served with lime juice, white onion, and peanuts. The sauce (soy sauce and oil base) was very tasty and it made the beef taste amazing.  Everyone ordered their own dishes, like Fish Tacos ($8.95), Tomato Rice (side order; $1.50), and the District One Rice Combo Platter ($11.95). The fish tacos were made with hamachi sashimi, avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomato in fried wonton \"shells\" and came in a set of three. It was okay, but nothing special. The tomato rice also lacked flavor and warranted a shrug. For the Combo Platter, you can choose between chargrilled short ribs or pork chop and it comes with kimchee, pickled vegetables, lap xuong (Chinese sausage), and a fried egg. The chargrilled short ribs were good and had a nice \"char\" flavor (no marinade).  I ordered the Slow Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice ($8.95), served with a soft boiled egg, and Jasmine rice. This was really delicious! The meat was soft and tender and the sauce created from the coconut juice and pork belly was fragrant. I threw my whole bowl of rice into the stone pot to utilize every drop of the succulent sauce. Even if there weren't any other successful dishes, I would come back just for pork belly coconut juice! Everyone else seemed to really enjoy it as well.  Service was really nice! We didn't realize that we had stayed almost an hour after their closing time, however, they were really cool about it. I like the menu because of its focus on Vietnamese fusion and obviously, that makes it unique. I don't eat Pho, but the MP Lobster Pho is definitely enticing! Not sure how much the price fluctuates, but it was approximately $27 last week. Anyway, I'm willing to give the other dishes a try and if anything, I'll always have the pork belly as a back-up plan!",

    "text": "Talk about another hidden gem in Vegas. I have been meaning too check this place out after hearing the buzz and looking at the pics it all looks really really good. I really am digging the sign/logo of the restaurant. If that doesn't make first impression from the moment you walk into the restaurant be surprise got upscale feeling too the place, even though bar area not that big really like the set up, and for any sports fan love the fact five widescreen all set up just like see at sports book bunch together. The prices are supa reasonable up and down the whole menu. The portion size for tapas style is really good size more so then other tapas style places been too in my experience. Love the diversity of the menu also wide range from cornish hen, bone marrow soup, more tradition pho dishes, or beef salad. Just talking about the entrees.   I no idea best place too start my District One Kitchen & Bar experience but the Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was on my radar. It the perfect soup too clear my running nose and sinus. Boy did it not disappoint! The broth had nice kick too it. But not over the top that not enjoy the full body of the broth. One of the best things about it is diversity of meats in it. Counted four different ones in the bowl. Really each time dug deep find another different treat in every scoop. It nice hearty Pho dish. Any sign of good Pho is no need too add anything more too the broth. The appetizers was tough but went with the Beef Buns. Talking about Buns in my last review Beef Buns brought back that same urge Bun crazy! They do have peking duck buns too believe but went with the pork buns. Talk about addicting get three per order but popping them down so easy wish order half dozen or hell could have done dozen. Really that good!! The pork is cooked nice crispy outside, moist inside, and glaze or sauce cooked in was fabulous could have ordered plate of pork! The topping of think hoisen or oyster sauce combine with garnish of julienne carrots and couple other things. The steam bun itself was the perfect Steam Bun with the perfect filling.   The service was awesome. I torn between the tacos and beef buns waiter recommending the beef buns. Save the tacos for next time. No doubt be few more times because lot of good stuff on the menu. Just happen ran into fellow yelpers Misti and Bobby. They were kind enough ask if wanted too join them. It was just me doing my yelp diligent checkout out all the ONO spots in Vegas. Lol!! Impromptu UYE with the one and only Misti Y and Bobby Y. Thanks.   Trust me if not checked out District One you need too. It really good food at reasonable price that we al can enjoy!!",

You have everything and anything that your Asian craving desire. On top of that, you have the selection from the old Cravin Cajun menu! Crawfish and shrimp bags!   I think that the Chicken Roti dish here should be their signature dish. I've been looking for years to find the equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bale-valley-restaurant-canoga-park\">yelp.com/biz/bale-valley...</a> and finally DOKB delivered. The game hen, so juicy, so crispy, so salty-sweet. It's the ultimate indulgence. Surprisingly it does not come with fish sauce dipping, so don't forget to ask for it. It's a must! It would be like eating egg rolls without the dipping sauce (which by the way this place makes a mean egg roll!!).   I can take my whole family here and every single person in the crowd would be pleased. I love the simple yet expansive menu selection. I appreciate not having to choose from 10 difference combination of Vietnamese rice dish when there's really only one.   I'm already craving my next meal here.....",

We ordered Belly Buns, Papaya Salad, and Serrano Chicken Wings. They have a decent menu with Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai choices. I am being generous with my 4 stars as 1 star each for service, atmosphere, menu selection and concept. The food was not the greatest though. I did not like the Belly Buns as they lacked flavor and the Belly was dry and small. I've had belly bao with a thick tender caramelized pork belly with pickled garnish and these were not good at all. The papaya salad lacked sweetness which would have balanced the sour and salty taste. The wings were crispy and big but they didnt give all flats. The drummette piece tasted dry and horrible. Usually in Asian joints they give you all flats when you order fried wings so that was disappointing. I did see the table next to is ordered a Black Pepper Dungeness Crab that looked pretty good. Maybe some of their other choices might be better than what we ordered. This is a cool place to watch the game and we will give it another try next time. The food is just so-so on our first visit here.",

Ten of us went there for the first time to try out their signature oxtail dishes. We happened to met one of the co-owners, Vy, who was very accommodating, explained the menu to help with some of the group with dietary restrictions. The oxtail dishes did not disappoint. Many of us ordered the oxtail pho - enough for two people. I suggest that you split the pho dish and then order other dishes to try out. The oxtail fries, oxtail fried rice, pork belly buns, or short ribs are just some of the tasty, reasonably  priced dishes. If you're not into oxtail, give it a try. You might be converted - they cook it for many hours in a bone marrow broth, seasonings, so it's so tender -- and gluten free to boot.  Aside from the excellent food, there's a full bar, great decor and friendly staff. District One is definitely on our Las Vegas MUST DO list. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I heard about this place mentioned a couple of times by not only my husband but a few of my foodie friends.  They told me that they had Oxtail Pho.  Man was I craving some Oxtail Pho during lent, I gave up noodles for Lent.    So, I finally had the chance to go and eat here with a few other peeps.  You know how it goes when there are more mouths to feed, more chances to try more food on the menu! Yesssssss.  We were greeted by a few of the staff and they began by telling us all the awesome things they had on special that night.  In nice resturant lingo like \"Chef has prepared....\" Hey District One, nice touch on selling your menu.  District one is the old Cravin Cajun.  They fixed up the restaurant really nice.  Plenty of room if you have a big party.  Ono (delicious) to the grinds.  We had oysters, squid, chicken wings, papaya salad, quail...and that is just to name a few.  Of course, I still managed to get Oxtail Pho.  I still like another Pho place because their Pho broth is bomb, but the price they charge here would actually bring me back because of that.  It wasn't bad pho broth.  They actually gave HUGE oxtails.  By the way, if you still want your crawfish/crab/shrimp boil fix, you can still get it from District One.  Think I will have to try that they next time.   And the pork belly seems to be a hit so I better try that too.    My hubs liked it because they had a lot of his favorite Asian Whiskeys.  See Jesse N :)  Well they made me a fan. As you can tell from my review I will be back.  I hope the hype stays good since I've seen this place change up a few times.  The variety they offer is awesome because everyone at the table should get different Asian fixes here...Yup, I said that.  Lil' asian me.",

    "text": "In the Hunger Games series District One is supposed to be the holy land riches and beauty. Er... maybe a better comparison would be the first class flight or flying coach, you'll both be getting the same destinations, just certain amenities of first class makes the experience all the better. The cushier seat, the dim lighting, more leg space, and more flight attendant service. District One should probably take a cue from Jet Blue.   The service here unfortunately gets worse and worse each visit. The first few visits started with longer wait times for food and progressively gotten to one of the worse service experiences I've had in a long time. No one was necessarily \"rude\" but the lack of sense or urgency really killed the experience. Maybe I should of seen it coming when it it took a day and a half to have our waiter take our order, which is usually not a big deal, you're busy I get it.   We told the server our orders and less than 2 minutes after we tried to cancel the fish tacos (because even with the happy hour pricing the cost/value was in the negatives).  When we asked the response was \"I just put in your order\". I know, you came to our table right after you placed it, but you're telling me that you can't change the order now because somehow in the past 2 minutes the fish was being cut fresh from the Pacific Ocean and the taco shell was being made fresh (obviously this is an exaggeration because the fish tacos took over 20 minutes to get to our tables, which many would presume is ample time to tell the kitchen to cancel the item).   What confuses me the most is that our orders were repeated to us by the server, yet 1 order of pho tai nam and an order of steak and eggs were missing? Maybe the kitchen is having a delay, no problem, but ten minutes later we followed up with it and the steak and eggs came out within minutes, perfect (except for the fact the rice should of been in a cereal box considering how crunchy it was) and then another 10 minutes later (a total of 40 mins waiting for our food) for a pho tai nam (came out minutes later as well).   The check was another hassle of its own, and in short, the party of 4 split the check 2 ways (which we wrote in pen) and it was still messed up. It took two reprints to fix things. Water refills? Wishful thinking.  So Kevin T, you obviously had terrible service, why the 2 stars? Fortunately and unfortunately D1 has the best pho (noodles cooked inconsistently though) and food for the majority ranges from acceptable to great. Sometimes theres lots of love in the food and sometimes... none.  Things to order:  Pho (any except lobster) Mekong River Noodle Soup Beef Carpaccio  Wings Beef (from their fairly crafty craft beer list)  Things to pass: Belly buns Lobster pho (really? #onlyinvegas) Expectations of great service Fish tacos (I have dog treats bigger than these)  Will I come back? Maybe someday when the raging hole in my heart after getting burned so hard by the service heals.",

Now for most stereotypical asians paying more than $10 for a bowl of Pho is insane unless you are at the TI on the strip but this bowl is worth every penny of its 11.95 price tag.  On work days when I'm having an ox tail soup craving and can't make it out to the California with an 11pm Ox Tail start time, I'm S-O-L but now I get to go to District One for the best of both worlds - Ox Tail and Pho.  Genius - yah, i know.  The soup is so rich from all the fat tender ox tail goodness falling off the bones as you gently prick it with your chopsticks. Im getting off thinking about it as we speak.  Anyhow go check it out.  Oh yah they do have other things like the Shaking Beef Salad, or Shaking Beef Steak and Eggs, Cornish Hen.  Everything here is pretty good but the first thing I'd order is their Ox Tail Pho!",

Entering the place seemed clean with booths around the edge and a bar with like 5 tvs directly to the back. Alot of Japanese whiskey and scotches on display and a good selection of draught beer. Bartender was attentive and it was happy hour. I ordered pretty much everything he recommended from the pork belly to the oxtail fried rice. Food was served in a very timely matter and was good!  Great place will definitely come back.",

She also offered us bar seating (must be 21 and over) which allowed us to be seated right away. So my boyfriend and I decided to sit there instead since we were so hungry.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It reminds me Urban Seoul or even a boiling crab. Staff was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the oxtail pho and my boyfriend decided to go with the most popular pho lobster. We also ordered half a dozen of fresh oysters and king crab legs with aioli!  1) oxtail pho: The broth was so yummy. It was very clean! I was happy not to see an immense amount of oil cruising around. And they were generous with the oxtail!  2) pho lobster: It had a nice presentation with the whole head and tail in there. I just wish there was more lobster. Pretty good. 3) oysters: So fresh. blue points. 4) king crab legs with aioli: Was pretty mediocre.. I expected a lot more of a taste to it for such a price.  I would definitely come back!",

They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.     Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory.   The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.    But man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.",

We actually ordered the fries but I'm so happy theres was a mix up because I'm sure the fried rice was better. It was my favorite thing we ordered!

    "text": "I give it a 3 1/2 stars.  Maybe we just ordered wrong?  I was super hyped about District One and I even braved the cramped parking lot with our SUV just to try this place out.  But we came away just a bit underwhelmed.  No pop!  No wow!  Just a long, drawn out poot.  District One was hoppin', no joke there.  Sports on the TV, alcohol flowin' freely, and lots of heads on tables.  Very busy but luckily no wait when we visited.  The place is nice - modern, vibey, nice leather booths.  Shiny & new!  But the food...eh...was a bit lackluster.  I love me some Vietnamese food, and I love me some fusion.  But while that may be good and appreciated, I gotta sway back to the classics.  What good is fusion if you don't have the classic down?  Does one not learn how to walk first before trying a 360 kick flip?  Do you just approach Heidi Klum and MInka Kelly without mastering the art of taking the 'grenade'?  I think not.  Perhaps we should have ordered differently at District One, because what we had just didn't impress.  The menu looks delicious, rice dishes, soups, noodles, lots of Asian-inspired cuisine.  But that day I really wanted pho, and the wifey really wanted wings.    We started off with the Tamarind Wings.  Wow.  For $6, I'm sorry to say, I felt a bit ripped off.  These were 6 of the tiniest @$$ wings I've ever seen!  At $1 a piece damn were they small.  I mean, these wings were literally half the size of those you see at a place like Wing Stop.  Nearly no meat!  I guess I wouldn't have complained if they were some bomb-diggety wings...but...they were bland.  Oh, just bland.  There was a bit of sweetness to them but that was it.  One note.  No mixing of flavors, no sour, no heat, no crunch, no nothing.  I don't think they were properly seasoned as well because I didn't get much of a salty flavor either.  So plain.  This app definitely left the wifey and I hungry and hoping the main dish would fit the bill.  We both stayed basic and got the Pho Bo Vien, the beef pho.  It came to the table steaming hot, nice.  But again....what's with the portion?  The bowl was smaller than what we were used to at other Vietnamese places around town.  And for $8 each, we were a bit surprised.  At other decent places around town, for the same price I can get the special pho with more goodies, and in a bigger bowl.  We got our little plate of veggies as well for sharing.  This included some basil, bean sprouts, and fresh chilies.  The pho was pretty good, District One has some great broth.  Not overly salty, lots of complex flavor, good on the palette.  But boy did I crave for more noodles and more beef to sop this broth up.    The service for us was excellent.  Server was very attentive, wasn't hesitant to let us know if we had any questions on the menu to just ask.    Water was kept filled.  Overall it was an OK first visit to District One.  The wifey and I left hungry and were eating again less than two hours later.  I think place does warrant another visit, but maybe next time we'll go with the more popular dishes they serve.  I do fancy some Big Bone Soup or some Oxtail Pho!",

    "text": "One of the best asian fusion restaurants I have ever tried--top notch food, service, and ambiance! I've heard so many good things about this place and now I can finally say I've tried it. This restaurant is unlike any other pho restaurant you expect it to be. In fact, upon arrival, you are nicely greeted by a host and directed to your seat within seconds (this could have also been due to the fact that we dropped in early for dinner). The lighting inside the restaurant is dim and the comes equipped with a bar and cushioned table booths as well! District 1 definitely puts a modern twist to the typical pho restaurant. Here is a list of what we ordered:  -Hot Jasmine Tea: Not too pungent, not too bland. Perfect for a cold winter night or if you are sick. -Grilled Squid Appetizer: Very flavorful and huge portions! Perfect amount of chewiness and flavor. Comes with a full squid (size of two hands); tentacles included! -Pork Belly Steamed Bun Sliders: So yummy! I wish there was more. They offer two different kinds of buns--crispy or steamed. We opted for the steamed and it was magnificent. Comes with three sliders. Pork belly was flavorful and melted in your mouth. They also have an option to add one more slider if you are planning to share this dish amongst an even number of people. -Oxtail Pho: Very plain, but still very good. The broth for me was a bit too salty, but the oxtail melted right off the bone. The chunks are gigantic, but the texture of the oxtail makes it super easy to eat. -Shigoku Oysters: this was a special the time we went. Raw oysters from Washington. Each oyster is $3.50. Man oh man were these oysters goooooood! The sauce they put on top of the oysters were spot on. It left me wanting more!  The service was also top notch! They even offered free beer flights of a new beer they were trying to promote when we were dining. We didn't taste it, but it was a very sweet gesture! Will I come here again? YES YES YES! I can't wait to try all the other options on the menu!",

The music goes well with their overall theme, and it ties the whole place together. All of the servers were knowledgable with all of the dishes, especially with the weekly specials they have. They checked in with us every so often and our glasses were never empty.  We ordered the spring rolls to start off, and I have to say that they are a must try for everyone. Each of us got an entree, but the ones that stood out the most would have to be the oxtail fried rice as well as the oxtail pho. The oxtail here is very tender, and we finished every single bite of it.    In conclusion, If you want great Vietnamese fusion with exceptional service to top it off, definitely come and give them a try. Sadly, I wasn't able to try the lobster this time, but I plan to in the near future!",

It was market price which came out to $49.99. It was good, lobster was an ok size.  They body came out deshelled and declawed.  The only shelled part were the head and tail. The broth was AMAZING! I wanted to take the bowl and sip right out of it (couldn't tell if there was MSG or not). Overall it was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. It was one of those dishes that I wanted to try once.  We also go the Oxtail fried rice and beef carpaccio with truffle oil. The oxtail fried rice was as good as the last time! Oxtail was tender and plentiful. The carpaccio was different than I expected - the beef was also slightly cooked which made it a littl3 chewier than I would have liked. I only had a few slices and left the rest for my husband to finish.",

I heard that this is one of the best pho places from multiple Vietnamese folks. I personally can't tell the difference, but they offer a variety of pho, and everything was delicious. The oxtail fried rice is a must as is the mikong pho. The ingredients are fresh and broth tasted clean, which are always pluses for me! We like to eat our pho with sliced onions as a side dish covered in chili sauce, and they came out with sliced red onions which was yummy and not usual at pho joints in LA.  We didn't get the infamous lobster pho (market price was $45 when we went which is quite steep for pho...) but I heard it's overrated and not worth the big bucks. They also had a Instagram special where if you post a photo on Instagram, they take $5 off the plate. Even that incentive was not enough for us to take part.  I'd recommend stopping by for a lunch meal, but I don't think it's worth any sort of wait. It's a fun atmosphere though!  We did have a slight issue with one of our dishes--lets just say we found an unwanted item floating in it. The server was really nice and apologetic about it and took it off our bill rather than sending out a new dish, which was perfect for us.",

The decor upon entering is nicely done in rustic and metal undertones. The fonts and quotes on the wall gives it a urban/chic feel.  Now to the food. The menu is pretty creative with all of my favorite classics with a twist. Asian fusion at its finest. Such as the Ox tail Pho or Lobster pho or fried rice. I usually order the Ox tail Pho. The broth is rich and savory with a hint of sweetness kissed by my hoisin and Sriracha.  The pork buns with is pork belly on an Asian bun never disappoints. You can get it regular or deep fried! If you're from the South like me, deep fried is a no-brainer! They also have razor clams when it's in season! It is  paradise in your mouth!  I can go on and on about the food...but what they do they do well. Their menu showcases everything you want in an Asian Fusion dish. A bit of influences everywhere.  The service is attentive. The staff even recognizing me although I am not a local. It makes you feel like this place is home!  Whenever you're in Vegas, or if you're craving some mind blowing food... stop by. You will not be disappointed. But this is strictly just my opinion. But what do I know?",

We tried the oxtail pho and the oxtail fried rice, and we were very underwhelmed by both. $16 for a bowl of pho? I don't care if it contains unicorn meat; at that price, I could get TWO bowls of pho from a traditional Vietnamese place that tastes infinitely better. The oxtail fried rice (also $16) was too greasy and contained shreds of meat so small, I wouldn't be able to tell it was oxtail unless you told me.  Sadly, they were out of coconut shells for their coconut ice cream that day, which was odd considering we were there on a Monday afternoon. Disappointed by the food and general lack of empathy from the staff, we decided to save our money and get dessert elsewhere.  Did we arrive on an off day? Who knows, but I don't see myself coming back to find out anytime soon.",

We actually wanted to eat at Asian BBQ & Noodles next door, but didn't realize that the BBQ place was closed on Fridays - so we \"settled\" for District One. And it was a pretty solid find!   HAPPY HOUR menu is from 5pm - 7pm and includes quite a nice selection of food & drinks that are TOTES worth it.  [Snacks to share] 1. Belly Buns (steamed) were good but nothing too amazing.  2. The fish tacos were a refreshingly crunchy bite-sized way to satiate our appetite for a bit.  3. The Green Papaya Salad was generous in raw shrimp, but was pretty one-dimensional in salty flavor. 4. Beef Carpaccio was super doused in truffle oil, so if that's your thing - you gotttaaaa get it. Just be ready for the fact that it's super bloody!   [Entrees]  1. At 6pm on a Friday, they were COMPLETELY sold out of their famous Big Bone Soup, which we were SUPER disappointed by. They said they were sold out since lunch and if we wanted to try it, they had no idea when it would be ready (since it takes hours and hours to make). Our sad faces weren't enough to convince the waitress to try to find some big bones they may have accidentally lying around. Bummer!! 2. Oxtail Fried Rice was probably the winner of the night! Large heaping mound of fried rice was warm, satisfying, and generously served with tender oxtail. It was very simply flavored, but super well done. It WAS a little on the oily side, but it did gave the rice a delicious smoothness. Plus it's served with an egg on top, cooked to whatever style you like!  3. Garlic Noodles were a close runner-up for the fave of the night. It's simple noodles, cooked in super garlicky oil so you may not see the garlic chunks, but it's there in EVERY SINGLE DELICIOUS BITE! The noodles were firm and had a chewy texture that I would liken to spaghetti that's just perfectly al dente. YUM!   [Dessert] The Coconut Ice Cream was a disappointment. The surprise is that it's not coconut-flavored ice cream, it's VANILLA ice cream served in a half-cut coconut, so you get just a wee bit of coconut meat with every bite. It was very dissatisfying and such a misnomer. We totally regret getting this.   [Overall] It was a variety-filled meal where you'll definitely find something for everyone. Service was A+ and food came out really quickly! Would recommend if you're feeling munchy and want to get plates to share. Plus there's a HUGE selection of alcoholic drinks to pair with all the feastin'!",

The anise and nutmeg flavors are subtle, perfection.  I would NOT recommend the BELLY BUNS. they are good but not great. They are lacking something bright to cut the fat. They vegetables are not really pickled and lack flavor. I added a squeeze of lime to the last bite which really made the last bite not so boring.   Cocktails are thoughtful and fun. I had the coconut mojito .... I am obsessed with coconuts. This cocktail is served in the freshly cut coconut used to make this cocktail. It. Is. Delicious.   Dessert: got the PANDAN LEAF CREME BRULEE. Light flavor of pandan and coconut. Very good but I wish they had a fruit garnish to complete the dish. Maybe mango or berries; either would balance out the dish.",

    "text": "Found out about this place from Chef's Night Out a segment from Munchies on Youtube. District One is known for it's lobster pho that goes for marketplace value of $50.00. We made reservations for 11:15am and realized we're coming in right when they opened so we really didn't need a reservation. The interior is very hip and modern looking with our hostess being very friendly and our waiter being informative funny and very attentive to our needs. What i liked when we ordered was that our waiter asked if we will need separate bills which is great as we don't have to bug the waiter/waitress if we can all have separate bills at the end of our meal so we divided our group into two to get 2 separate checks (to make it easier for our server).   I ordered the specialty ox tail loco moco after seeing it on yelp. The dish was very rich and heavy; it came with plenty of ox tail and the egg was cooked perfectly sunny side up however it did not come with a meat patty like normal loco moco and may have helped with the richness of the dish. The Ox tail fried rice is what i should have ordered as it was balanced in flavor and would be good if it came with little side dishes (like korean style banchan). My friend complimented on how good the Bun Bo hue and big bone marrow soup was.  The Lobster pho is basically pho that comes with a whole lobster. I must say that this dish is all hype imo. The broth is not infused with lobster it's just regular pho nothing to special about it. The lobster itself was over cooked to a rubbery chewy meat; though it looks amazing in photos and video it is what it is; basic pho with overcooked lobster for $50.00. The Vietnamese donkey which is a beefed up version of a moscow mule was extremely refreshing  the strong ginger taste is welcoming and the drink is just well executed.  many people believe the Lobster Pho is this restaurants staple, but for me the ox tail fried rice is where it's at.",

    "text": "Nommmmmmmmm! Loved this place. It's outside of the Las Vegas Strip! My friend spotted 'lobster pho' on some website and wanted to go so we tried it out and it was delicious. Not only was all the food delicious, the customer service was excellent. I'm glad we discovered this place.   We ordered: * Coconut Juice - came in a real coconut (I originally thought it was going to be like those viet restaurants that come in a cup and some coconut pieces) but this came in a legit coconut and you can carve the inside for yummy coconut * Matcha Thai Tea - I was tempted to get this, so I was asking the waitress questions about it and she offered to give us samples which was very nice of her. The taste of this was a little too sugary for me, very sweet combination. I passed on this.  * Belly Buns - they ask if you want it steamed or fried, we got steamed! This was very tasty and had a big pieces of pork belly * Bok Choy - we got two different kinds. One with garlic only and the other with spicy garlic. Both were really good. A tad oily, but the spicy one had a really nice spicy kick to it. * Oxtail Fries - it reminds me of poutine fries - it had oxtail meat pieces with the gravy all on top of the fries and we had egg on top. This was sooo good and creamy. * Oxtail Pho - If you love oxtail soup, you should try this. It's pretty self explanatory for the oxtail pho. The broth tasted like oxtail (not heavy/strong) - it was light and tasted delicious.  * Lobster Pho - expensive, but worth to try it if you love lobster. This was my friends bowl so I only tried the broth ~ the broth had the lobster kick to it. It was soooo good. Good hangover soup for sure.  In the end, they were nice enough to give our bride a complimentary congrats coconut ice cream in the end (we were all dressed up in our bride squad tanks). THAT WAS SO GOOD. I love coconut, it had something else in it I believe, but it was just nice of them to give it to us. If you love coconut - get whatever ice cream dessert they got!",

I can't remember all the yummy stuff they put on top of the house special ones, but it was delicious! The Oxtail Fried Rice was also really really good! I will absolutely be ordering this again on my next visit. Last, but definitely not least was the 5 Spice Roasted Cornish Hen. Flavor is fabulous! I substituted the garlic noodles ($3.00 charge) for the tomato rice that this dish usually comes with because we had the Oxtail Fried Rice........ and personally, I am so glad I did....... the garlic noodles were perfect texture and super garlicky!!!! (that probably is not proper grammar, or spelling, but oh  well, you get it right?) Tons of garlic flavor!!!! I will definitely be back to try the Pho..... that Lobster Pho looks like fun!",

Instead of cooking when I got home, I decided to hit somewhere in Chinatown and eat there.  I saw the District One sign and made my decision then.  The restaurant had a fair number of people so I sat at the bar.  For one person, that often is a good option.  I looked over the menu for some time and opted to eat healthier than normal.  I ordered the Shaken beef salad with house dressing.  It was a nicelyu done mix of greens with tender, warm beef slices, and topped with the house dressing,  The flavor was a little spicy which was good.  After finishing my salad, one of the servers asked me about dessert.  He named two things and when he said coconut, he had me.  I got the coconut ice cream which is a half fresh coconut with ice cream inside and nuts on top.  As you eat the ice cream, you scoop out the coconut meat and it's a very good combination to get ice cream, fresh coconut, and nuts in one scoop.  Service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled a couple of times and I didn't need to ask.  A very pleasant stop!",

    "text": "Came in at 11pm after my shift (I'm a server as well) with my coworkers. Our server seemed to be in a rush with taking our order after we told her a few times that we weren't ready. We ordered some drinks to start (sake and a few beers.) We had never been there and were unsure what to order food wise. She brought our drinks and continued to hurry us. We then ordered a few dishes. One of which was market price which she didn't explain. It was shrimp skewers which came untraditionally meaning it was an entire prawn grilled on a skewer head on and all. We also ordered oyster. She waited until all of our food was delivered to then let us know they were out of oysters for the night. After finishing our food my friend was still hungry so we tried to order steak and eggs. Our server never came back to the table as we watched her do her closing procedure (Flip chairs and mop) we had to grab another person. I then decided to ask the busser to bring our server over. I wanted to make sure she got our order and also we needed straws. She replied yes and then never came back again until we asked for the check. Btw the steak and eggs wasn't traditional meaning steak was chopped up and marinated with a salad over it. Also egg was over rice. It just would've been nice for someone to explain these things to us. Overall the food was okay, the service wasn't terrible she just wasn't present... being a server I know how it is and I like to give the benefit of the doubt but she really didn't seem to care about her tables and mostly just wanted to clean so she could go home after closing. Mind you we finished our meal at 12:20... the restaurant closes as 1... anyways, our tip reflected your service. Not sure what her name was because we didn't get it but she was young and had braces. Try to care about your tables a tad bit more, doing the minimal isn't that hard.",

The menu selection is overwhelming with the array of choices. Where do I even start? They have snails, lobster, ox tail, and even oysters! They bring out the chart of specials and we decided to get the black peppered lobster, surf n turf pho, and the snails. Snails can be done in a few different styles and we picked the spicy Thai chili. It was such a delight. The flavor of lemongrass and chili and spice combined well. Take it from someone who does not enjoy spicy food as much. I'm a weak one but I sucked it up for this particular dish. The black peppered lobster was my favorite and the noodles were wonderful. We actually didn't realize the dish came with noodles until it came out. The server are really sweet but I felt like our particular server was so so. The music playing was nice but the speakers were directly at our table which made it difficult for him to hear what I was saying. The last thing we had was the coconut ice cream. It is served onto of a coconut shell with real coconut. It was a great treat. Overall, it was a great experience and I am definitely coming back!",

The server did a great job of recommending the specials and what was popular on the menu. We ordered the oxtail loco, oxtail fried rice, fish tacos, and pork buns. The fish tacos were awesome, I liked the presentation but the taste is what got me. I ordered extra to go. The oxtail fried rice is a huge serving, and was good. Really good if you enjoy garlic. Wish I was a lobster lover, otherwise I would have ordered the lobster pho, there's always next time!",

For the pricey bowl of pho, I think the noodles could have been more plentiful. A few more strands couldn't hurt, noodles are cheap. My daughter had the garlic noodles and they were yummy.

    "text": "I wanted to give this place a five because i really liked the food but i felt the staff especially the manager was lacking. My bf and i started with the razor calms at $14.95. They were meaty but flavor was only ok. We also got the fish tacos which were pretty good. It came with three wantons skins fried and shaped like taco shells and filled with yellow tail and added veg. My bf got the oxtail pho. I thought the broth was very flavorful and i enjoyed it alot. The oxtail was fall off the bone tender. I had the district one rice combo. That included a large heap of white rice with a fried egg on top, pretty spicy kim chee, pickled veg, a small and thin but very tender and full of tasty goodness pork chop. The seasoning on it was to die for. Lastly it was suppose to have chinese sausage. My food came out and i noticed the sausage i was really looking forward wasnt on my plate. I told the waiter that explained yo mr thats what i ordered. I told him that what i read on the menu was different so he went to check then to the kitchen then back to me. He apologized and said the kitchen ran out of the sausage which i have never heard of a kitchen running out of a regular item on a menu that is in fact offered twice on the menu, even worse 168 supermarket is across the street and houses about 20 varities of chinese sausage. I was quite disappointed and shocked that the kitchen didnt inform my waiter and i guess i wasnt suppose to notice. To appease me they brought out free coconut ice cream that too was yummy. Upon heading to the bathroom i saw food come out with the sausage. I asked a waiter and they said i saw it correctly. I called the manager over who was comfortably dressed in running pants and nikes and explained what happened. She told me they did run out if the sausage and sent someone to the store after i was served and she felt the ice cream was a nice enough gift. I told her it was but i wanted the sausage now that was suppose to be in my meal to begin with she said the she thought the ice cream would have taken care of that which i replied that i would pay for \"her kind gift\" if its a issue but i wanted my sausage. I hate to say im coming back cause clearly customer service is lacking but i really enjoyed the food. I should have known the manager was a joke when i saw her behind the bar getting her hair played with.",

Our drinks were constantly topped and the waitress constantly came back to check on our table. The food also came our really fast, one dosh after another! Most importantly, everything was amazing! We ordered :  Pho with rib eye meat- The broth was really good and a good amount of meat  Grilled razor clams- topped with green onion and roasted peanuts (very good)  Beef Carpaccio- meat was very tender, and the sauce was perfectly seasoned (very good)  Raw Oysters- topped with their house special ponzu ( very good)  Green mango salad mixed with squid, Onions, mint, and a light vinaigrette- this dish was light, but it didn't stand out as I thought. Perhaps the squid can be grilled instead of blanched? I would try another type of salad next time  Fish tacos- This was my least favorite appetizer. I was thinking of a more similar concept to sushi roku or nobu yellowtail tacos.  Overall, it was a great experience. We have marked our spot for future returns to Vegas!",

We were a large group and you could tell that the place was full of locals and mostly non Westerners (which I took as a good sign). The place is beautiful and had a very relaxed atmosphere made all the more inviting by its lovely and charming owner. Certainly not an expert on Vietnamese food but coming from NYC I can tell and appreciate well crafted food and this place definitely has it. From the Big Boned Soup to the Beef Carpaccio everything was wonderfully prepared, fresh and full of flavor. If you are in the Las Vegas area I highly recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "Located in the same shopping center on Jones Blvd as \"China Mama\" and \"Chada Thai,\" this Vietnamese-inspired, pan-Asian restaurant has a very different look and feel than most of the nearby Asian spots. From the huge drink selection, to the flat screen TVs playing sports, to the modern, urban, and industrial decor, it's clear the owners designed this space to be a cool destination to hang out, socialize, drink, and dine. District One Kitchen & Bar is also open until 3am and offers some decent happy hour specials from 3pm-6pm and midnight to 3am.  I recently tried this place with four friends on Friday night at 9pm upon the recommendation of an acquaintance. Besides the limited parking in a crowded parking lot, our only complaint was that our five entrees arrived at four different times -- each of them 3-4 minutes apart. The staff made up for it by being extremely attentive with our drinks, however -- three of us had 3-4 refills each -- and a female manager was very gracious and friendly as we exited the restaurant. The food we ordered was also just as good as advertised.   The five of us shared the garlic serrano pepper wings, pork belly buns, Vietnamese beef carpaccio, and fish tacos for our appetizers. The beef carpaccio was definitely our favorite and the fish tacos our least favorite (mainly because of the small portion and $8.95 price tag).  I ordered the Crispy Bird Nest Noodles for my entree and the dish was so tasty I didn't offer a bite to anyone in my group. Two of my friends ordered the Steak & Eggs and raved about the flavor of the steak but complained the eggs weren't cooked to their specification. We were collectively happy with our experience overall, however, and we each agreed we would be back in the future.",

I would say the best dish was the combo platter with pork chop (or short ribs if you prefer), kimchee, fried egg, and chinese sausage. That dish can easily be shared by 2 people as the portion size is pretty huge. I would say the oxtail fried rice was the least exciting dish as it only had oxtail, egg, and onions. I wanna try their cornish hen and pork belly dishes next time. We will be back!   P.S. Oh ya, they got happy hour too!",

(Happy hours are Mon-Fri 5pm-7pm, Sun-Thurs 12am-2am.) The atmosphere is very modern and styled similarly to Boiling Crab, with lots of wall decor. They also had a really good reggae playlist playing in the restaurant.  Our server, Jewel, was super sweet and attentive throughout our meal. She constantly checked up on us to refill our waters or to ask how we liked the food. She was really knowledgeable about the menu as well; a majority of the food we ordered were recommendations from her!  BELLY BUNS - 3.95 during happy hour, 6.95 regular price You have the option of getting the buns steamed or deep-fried. We tried them deep-fried for that extra crunch and texture, but I've heard they tasted just as good when steamed. Definitely get these, as they seem to be a favorite among District One-goers. I'm not a huge fan of pork, but the pork belly was sooo good and juicy. I recommend!  OXTAIL PHO - 13.99 The pho is a little pricier than the bowls you could get at some of the Vietnamese places deep in Chinatown or elsewhere, but for good reason! They were extremely generous with the oxtail, and it was cooked to perfection; not too fatty, which is how I like it! The broth was just the right amount of salty, and I didn't end up with one of those nasty MSG-headaches after my meal. Broth-to-noodle ratio was perfect!  SHORTRIB RICE - 12.99 This was my brother's order, and I was able to get a few bites in before he finished it all! I believe it comes with steamed rice topped with an egg (anyway you want it), short ribs, Chinese sausage, and pickled carrots/radish.   OXTAIL FRIED RICE - 12.99 Again, the oxtail wasn't lacking in amount; there were pieces in every single bite. The rice wasn't too bland or too salty. The rice is also topped with a fried egg. So so so good, and enough to share with one or two others. I recommend this one too.  Overall, the food was extremely satisfying and didn't leave me feeling too full or gluttonous. I definitely see myself coming back the next time I'm in Vegas! It's open until 2am too; perfect for late night cravings!  (SIDEBAR: I ended up forgetting my wallet here and didn't realize it until I was back in my hotel room at the Vegas strip. Thank you so much to the District One staff for their integrity and safeguarding it until I made it back out to the restaurant to pick it up!)",

And what I love most about coming here is that they open late and so therefore while all the other restaurants are closing around 1-2 am this place gives you an extra hour to eat and I love it. This place is the perfect place to eat late at night and their food is so delicious I mean go try the oxtail fries next time it's well worth it I promise.

My family and I also ordered oxtail fries with shreds of oxtail meat in sauce that is poured on top of the fries. I don't eat fries at all and I was trying not to eat it but I have no regrets. If I was to eat fries, it would only be the oxtail fries because that was seriously the best thing I have ever eaten... In terms of French fries. We also ordered hot tea and they give you this big tea cup with tea bags. The hot tea served is green tea and they give you pots of hot water. I think that topped it all off because when you eat late at night to early morning, you just want good food served in attractive cups, bowls, or plates. This place is a must try and it is just wonderful!",

    "text": "The first time I was here, I ordered the belly buns, house special oysters, and of course, their famous oxtail fried rice. Everything was spot-on amayyyzing, and the fried rice was definitely one of the best I have ever had. The service was especially great as we the waiters were always ready to come whenever we group needed more water, wanted more food in the menu, or needed the bill. Very professional.  However the second time, not so much. We came during the night this time, so I do admit that it was fairly busy. When we were seated it took quite a while for a waiter to come and receive our order, and after that, it took 22 minutes before we were served our water (yes I counted). We were already dying of hunger, and then they could not quench us of our thirst!! I believe that every restaurant should not make this costly mistake of forgetting to serve the customer water. I had to remind the staff that they forgot it.  On the bright side, the oxtail fried rice was still awesome as ever, but for the blunder made earlier, I am only giving this place 4 stars.",

There are way better pho and egg rolls place in town.  Service... people are nice I have to say, but that's as far as it goes. To me they are lacking some common sense or proper eating etiquette. During our meal ,we got asked so many times \"How is everything?\" While we are trying to eat hot pho, how do you expect us to answer you when you can clearly see we all have mouthful. Not only we were \"checked on\" by our server but other 4 different girls stopped by and asked the same questions over and over. Can't we just have a peaceful meal? When we do need them to pay bills, no one can be found!!!  Tips... by the end of the meal, all of us were so annoyed just want to pay the bill and leave. They have the iPad bill pay at your table which is convenient but the tipping system starts 15%, we really didn't think the food and service deserve that but didn't have much choice there.  We won't be coming back here for sure.",

They are so sweet and taste so clean and refreshing.  The beef carpaccio is really unique and our table had to re-order it twice in one sitting because it was that good. The wings were also a hit.   The mediocre: All of the entrees I've tried were just okay.  I've had the Mekong river noodles, lobster pho, shaking beef, bone marrow soup, and short rib with rice and none of them were really that good.  The lobster pho did not taste better than any other pho (actually less flavorful).  For some reason everything was very bland compared to the appetizers.   The bad: The Porkchop with rice was extremely dry. Three people at our table ordered it and had to force it down.   Overall, the appetizers overshadow the main courses, hands down. It's like they build you up for something really amazing and then kinda let you down. Regardless, I will keep coming back for the oysters.",

Two was the free falling moment from skydiving over the island of Oahu.   Three was discovering the loster pho and oxtail fried rice from district One in Vegas.   One of my favourite to go to food is pho so naturally it's in the basket. I also like seafood so when I saw a whole lobster in my bowl of pho it was a happy moment for me.   The presentation was amazing but moving past that the flavor of the broth was superb . It was rich, aromatic and the noodle was perfectly cooked to my liking.   Oxtail was something I'm familiar with however not cooked in the fried rice format. I thought it would be bland and just like regular fried rice. I was utterly wrong. The dish was perfect. The rice wasn't too dry or moist, the portion of oxtail was very generous.   This spot is a must if you like Vietnamese cuisine or fusion cuisine. It's also a good hangover food spot seeing how it's open til 2am. Saving you from those sad chip bags from 7/11. Pretty considerate if you ask me .",

    "text": "District one is somewhat of a novelty restaurant. They get you to come in by offering things you would not normally see in a typical Vietnamese restaurant. Most notably is the lobster pho, where they put an entire cooked lobster in your noodles. While the idea is clever and unique, the price is a little steep for me. While I do love lobster and pho, I wouldn't pay $50 per bowl for it, especially when I can get a good bowl of pho for under $6 back home. Some of the more affordable dishes are the big bone soup, which has tons of delicious cartilage that just falls off the bone and juicy marrow. There's no noodles in it, just soup, but it's good nonetheless. Ox tail fried rice isn't something you see all the time, but they certainly make it good here. I wish some restaurants in Orange County would start picking this dish up.   Service is wonderful, but you better get their early or be prepared to wait in a long line!",

Anna was not the best.  Beers came out after appetizers.  Then the incorrect beer came out.  On top of that, she rarely checked on us.  Didn't get our main order until we flagged her down; but once our main dinner came out it was incorrect again.  At that point I had enough.  I asked for a manager to give us another server because at this point the service was ruining the whole experience for us.  Aaron came out and immediately corrected the situation and he is the only reason this review is getting a 3 star and not one.  The food is to amazing to stop coming here; but I will definitely make sure Anna is not serving us after this night.",

    "text": "Come for the overhyped pho but stay for the appetizers and other dishes.   This place is so heavily advertised that we had to make this a mandatory stop on our trip.  I was not impressed with the pho dishes at all. The Oxtail pho had decent flavor and the taste seemed to get more rich as I kept eating. The Lobster pho was bland and probably the biggest disappointment. I understand this is \"exotic\" pho but $14 and $MP, respectively, they weren't worth it. What was even more disappointing was paying so much for the pho and it didn't even include the basic meatballs, flank, tripe, tendon, etc. With these two bowls of Pho, you are very limited on meat. You're better off going to a normal Pho restaurant and paying less for more (food & broth quality).   Oxtail Fries were delicious. The gravy wasn't too salty nor was it too rich. It had the right amount of flavor and I would recommend it.   Grilled Squid was also a worthy dish. The squid had a hearty, meaty taste instead of being rubbery so you know it was grilled perfectly. The spicy aioli was a nice touch (as you know I love aioli).   King Crab with spicy aioli was my absolute favorite. The only thing I didn't like about  the dish was that it had me wanting more afterwards. The spicy aioli was a great compliment to the sweet chunk of king crab.   I would still come back here. There are many dishes that I consider unique, and I think it's definitely worth a few more visits. However, I wouldn't recommend the pho unless you're coming for the hype. And if you are, my opinion wouldn't matter anyways.",

My friends and I ordered... Bone marrow soup Oxtail pho Half a dozen of oysters (blue point?) Oxtail fries  Let me tell you. Everything was delicious. I got here ten minutes before happy hour ended and the server informed us so we quickly got a few oysters for $1.25 each. The size of the bone marrow soup was HUMONGOUS!!! It was larger than our head. The oxtail fries were surprisingly BOMB. I actually wish I had more room in my stomach so I could finish it :/  The pho was amazing as well. I think it is a bit overpriced, but I'm originally from the east coast so maybe there's a general price difference between the west and east coast? The broth tasted homemade for certain and the portion was huge as well. I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in the area.  I really wanted to try their lobster pho but it's $50 so.... maybe when I'm rich or something, I'll come back to try it.",

My favorite appetizer was the beef carpaccio. I never thought I would enjoy rare beef because I'm a well-done (don't hate me) type of person, but this dish melts in your mouth leaving you wanting to for more.   Pho Tai Bo Vien is my go-to order at any pho restaurant. Paying a total of ~$12 for a bowl compared to $6 from SD is just not what I'm used to. It was $3 extra for tai (rare steak). But granted they do give you a TON of meat. The rare steak is cut thicker than most traditional pho places that clumps into balls when left in the soup broth for too long. I'd recommend getting the steak on the side.   Staff was pretty nice! They were quick with filling our waters and picking up the finished plates.",

I guess I'm just used to golden deli in Cali but yeah the pho was a little off to me. Also, the spring rolls was a little different to me just cuhs the flavor was an acquired taste. The only way I can describe it is \"sweet & minty.\" I like the little crunch tho.   On the plus side, the service was great! I don't know if we had a specific server but there was a couple girls going around. Myra was super attentive! She kept making rounds for anything we needed.   Overall, everyone was great. Pho alone was ok, but I might try to chicken rice next time. Everyone seems to be eating that when we came in!",

Parking can be tricky and we were there on a Saturday night around 8pm. We ordered a lot. We ordered the snails, oxtail fries, their infamous lobster pho, oxtail pho, oysters and this thin slice meat appetizer. OMG!!!! Everything was so good. Each dish didn't need anything extra to my opinion. It wasn't oily, greasy and didn't make you feel heavy even after all that food. I couldn't stop eating! We saw the bone marrow pho and that can feed at least 3-4 people! It was huge!!!! I'm so coming back here! Customer service was great. It was my cousins bday and and they brought out a coconut ice cream dessert and that was really good too! Highly recommended to anyone coming to Vegas. So worth the wait! See you soon District One!!!!!",

    "text": "3.5 stars for this visit, I will round up to 4.  My friend suggested we come here for dinner since he was in the mood for Asian food. District One is trendy Vietnamese fusion restaurant. I had trouble finding parking (Saturday night), so had to park across the street.  Service was good, and people checked on us regularly and refilled our waters. The menu wasn't huge, and I decided to pick one of their specialty dishes, lobster pho.  The pho comes with a whole lobster, and a decent amount of meat. While the dish was tasty overall, I was actually expecting the broth to be richer, considering that it was cooked with an entire lobster.   The menu did say market price, and I knew lobster wouldn't be cheap, but the bowl of lobster pho ended up costing $49, and after tax and tip, I spent $61 on my meal. Not really worth it in my opinion. I could have bought an entire fresh lobster and made my own pho for under $30.   Not super impressed by my first visit, but I'm sure other dishes are more reasonably priced, and there were many seemingly appealing dishes on the menu.",

I've sat at the bar and have also sat in the booth. I have always had friendly service and quality food. I have tried the wings, the squid (both calamari and grilled), oxtail fried rice and the crispy noodles (birds nest type dish).   ALL THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS. I will say, they are also quite the portion sizes. The dishes can easily be shared with your group. Sometimes it's great to have the small plates to be shared with your group as well.  I find that they make great drinks as well.  There's quite a variety that you can truly explore from their menu. It's also great to hangout at the bar. The bartenders are always friendly and fun to talk to.   The restaurant also has a great vibe. Music isn't too loud--perfect for a fun casual dinner with some friends. I believe you an also rent out one of the smaller rooms as well. I will say one thing that would increase this from a 4 to a 5 star would be having more food selections.   I'll update when I try the lobster pho! haha",

I also would like to touch on the parking lot, since it was pretty packed. The center that the restaurant is located in, is very filled with popular places, so I actually ended parking about 5 rows away from the spot. Mind you this is at about 9pm.

    "text": "Bottom line first:  if you're prepared to spend $50 on the black pepper lobster, get it. You can thank me later. Parking is atrocious   So I stumbled upon this listing while looking for new places to explore. The more I read from others, the more I became obsessed with it. However, the fact that I could not make a Yelp reservation nor get through by phone twice to make said reservation almost turned me away. Fortunately, my persistence prevailed, and I was able to secure a spot.   All that effort seemed to be unnecessary, as the restaurant was not that full on a Saturday night. On the contrary, parking was a nightmare, as I already predicted from not one but two prior visits to this plaza. I even had to switch from a spot designated for the pizza place for fear of getting towed. Fortunately, I was able to stalk a nice family to their car and secure that treasured spot, with at least 4 other cars floating around.   Nonetheless, once we were seated, we were greeted friendlily (wanna go down a rabbit hole?  Search \"friend\" and \"adverb\") and were provided with recommendations of the popular dishes. Although the specials with the lobster were pricy at $50, we had to go for it. With all the nice reviews of the oxtail fried rice, we ordered that as well.   Thankfully, the black pepper lobster was every bit as flavorful as I had hoped. It was a little more spicy than I expected, but in a good way and not overwhelming. The portion with the accompanying chow mein was filling too. The oxtail fried rice was also delicious. We couldn't finish both dishes between the two of us, as I wanted to save room for dessert elsewhere. Thus, we boxed the fried rice for later.   Although the lobster was excellent, its price makes it hard for me to label it as excellent value. That, along with the shortcomings from the reservation and parking (I understand the latter is not within the control of the institution, but it's impractical to park elsewhere), will prevent me from giving it all 5 stars, but I still highly recommend the place to people who are prepared for the challenges. I also look forward to returning and trying new dishes.",

From the bar: Kronenberg, vietnamese coffee with Hennessey, and vietnamese donkey. Catch me here at happy hour or any hour, sometimes just for drinks. Many times, when I have visitors from out of town, they request to come eat here. Parking can be hard to find during dinner time or late night due to all the other businesses in the plaza.

It was pretty impossible to order just one thing. But their portions were so huge, thankfully both times we went we were in a group so we were able to share food.   The first time we went was at night. I was pretty drunk so I didn't really know what to order. I ended up getting the Oxtail Fries. SO FREAKING GOOD! It was pretty big so I took it home and sadly it wasn't good in the morning. My boyfriend got the Oxtail Pho and he let me taste it and I loved it. My friend got the Wonton Soup but I didn't try it until the next morning since she ended up taking it home.   The next morning when we were all leaving Vegas my friends decided to come back again. This time we had an even bigger group. I just ordered the Oxtail Pho and Fresh Coconut. I was able to finish my noodles but I ended up giving away my Oxtails because it was too much for me. My boyfriend got the Oxtail Fried Rice. One of our friends got the Lobster Pho. I loved it, the Lobster was very meaty and the broth didn't taste like regular Pho broth. It pretty much just tasted like Lobster, no other way to really explain it. My other friend ordered something that was like sauteed Green Beans? I wish I remembered what it was called! That was probably my favorite dish out of everything we all tried.   They had a wide variety of alcohol and I was so tempted to try the Vietnamese Coffee mixed with Hennessey. But I didn't want to leave Vegas feeling weird since Vietnamese Coffee is already strong for me. Plus alcohol was pretty expensive.   Customer service was great. Food came out pretty quick. It is a bit on the pricey side but I feel like it's worth it. I can't wait to come back to Vegas just to come back to this place!",

It took me almost 20 minutes to find a parking space due to the limited amount of spaces shared between District One and about ten other restaurants.   The bar has an impressive menu of specialty mixed drinks, beer, and wine. Once our table was ready we ordered the oxtail fries, lemongradd beef, fried calamari, pho, and more. The oxtail was so tender and flavorful that it almost melted in my mouth.   However, I wish the fries were fried slightly longer so that they would be a little more crispy to hold up to all of the oxtail gravy. The beef pho was great, the broth was flavorful and not too salty and there was a good ratio of meat and noodles. Delicious food but next time I come I will make sure to ask for extra crispy fries.",

They used to be packed with people waiting inside and outside but this last time there was no wait.  I initially thought 'nice, got seated right away' but then found out why.  The waitress took a while to come to our table and the service was just slow on everything. I ordered the Pho tai nam and there was so much fat on the meat that I ended up not finishing it. You can see from the picture that's what I ended up leaving behind.",

I always heard about the good food from other people, and reading the recommendations on Yelp, I was so happy to finally came here to eat. I always loved the Oxtail dishes before, and immediately I decided to order the Oxtail Pho, the Oxtail fried rice, and also ordered the Grilled Whole Squid for appetizer. The waiter told us that our order is the most popular in District One. Knowing that, I was very comfortable with my order.  The air was filled with very good food smell, and I actually got very hungry. Very soon our food arrived. Everything looked amazing! After the first bite, I immediately knew that everything will be delicious. And it was! Truly, I think they serve the best Pho, the best fried rice, and everything.   The Oxtail Pho was very delicious, not salty but very flavorful, with lots of tender meat and rice noodles. I didn't even put in any of the vegetables from the side. That is my most favorite Pho in Las Vegas! The Oxtail fried rice was also very delicious, with tasty oxtail meat pieces in it.  The Grilled Whole Squid was also amazing, according to my friend. I didn't eat that.  The restaurant has lot of tables and seats , has a full service bar. We didn't order any alcoholic beverages but next time I will try some of their specialty drinks.  This place is open late! Very popular, so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table!",

    "text": "I think this place is a very hip and fun place to be. It totally reminds me of a revamped cajun shrimp place because there are (3?) sinks outside of the bathroom. The decor and what not also remind me of boiling crab.  They have beer, wine, cocktails, and other liquor. They pump up some rad music too. The food is actually very flavorful, but there are some drawbacks. The price is so-so in that most things are just a little expensive, but then again they have some super expensive dishes  (Lobster pho and the big bone soup will be more expensive)  I tried their: -Mekong River Noodle Soup- This noodle is the best bet for someone looking for a light noodle soup for a hangover. It is light and flavorful. Sometimes beef pho feels a little heavier, so the mekong is a great alternative, especially for older adults. I feel like my grandma would be able to eat this happily.  -Shaken beef salad\" stir-fried beef over salad. This was actually my favorite because the meat was super flavorful. So you have some delicious savory meat mixed with raw vegetables. It's a delicious balance that makes you feel like you stayed healthy, yet your heart is fulfilled. However, the beef is quite salty! -Crispy bird's next noodle- was crispy and then softened by the heavy sauce they add. Very flavorful and quite good. It was just too thick and heavy for me. I didn't even finish half of it. I had to take the rest home. It's a huge serving, so you could easily share the one dish between two hungry individuals. Or do family style and split it as a side between 4-5 people (it's a lotttt of food). It's very similar to a chinese noodle (hong kong pan fried noodle?), so I ended up not liking it as much because the noodles were not the way I personally like it. -sea snails: not as bad as I thought it would be but definitely not ever going to get that again. It's kind of chewy like geoduck.",

I love what District One is trying to do by modernizing Vietnamese cuisine and appealing to a certain demographic. This place is cool, hip and a joint I would want to hang out at with my friends. However, I am less impressed with the food. Pho is very lacking in flavor, portions of appetizers are really small and prices are higher end compared to other Viet restaurants. I was most dissapointed by the hamachi tacos. 3 of the tiniest tacos the size of a pinky finger and literally a teaspoon of fish in each for over $10. I also ordered the oxtail fries. It had an interesting flavor with Viet spices that were very pronounced. It was ok but the 6+ chunks of gelatinous fat really grossed us out. These pieces were about 22\" of pure fat! I think they were trying to pay homage to the oxtail fries at Bachi but really fell short. Wings are always good and the steak and egg platter was as well. There was a nice selection of seafood on their specials board including razor clams, octupus and oysters. I'll try more menu items next time and adjust stars accordingly.",

Early in the afternoon they had run out of two popular dishes (big bone soup and lobster pho) as well as their coconut ice cream. I know certain dishes in restaurants do run out due to popular demand but in those cases I would expect the staff to at least suggest alternative dishes. They didn't even do that or show much empathy to the fact that I was disappointed that they didn't have what I wanted. This staff lacks customer service and pride for their food and restaurant. What I got was a waitress that alternated with another waiter while they clearly displayed a miscommunication of service. At the beginning these two made them selves available to take our order at different times when we had already given our order to one of them. Then they alternated breaking the news of the dishes they ran out of. In my opinion one unavailable dish is permissible , two is cause for concern, and three means they may need to fire their purchaser. They have good product but the business is amateur. My visit was 1/3/15",

Eventually, she came over, seated us, and returned to her friend and a group of young gentleman sitting near the bar.  She never left that spot the rest of the time that we were there.  In my opinion, not the best managerial customer service.  But I digress...we arrived during Happy Hour, so I ordered two orders of the pork belly baos and one order of the tamarind chicken wings.

    "text": "I want to give this place more stars because my food was delicious but unfortunately my last two visits had terrible service. I am not one to complain, but they just made their second strike with me last night. My first time I got the oxtail loco moco and my boyfriend got the shrimp with the D1 goodness sauce. The loco moco came out in 10 minutes. It was super flavorful and came in a big portion. My boyfriend's shrimp came out 20 minutes later which makes the cooks or servers seem really inconsistent. Not only did he wait 20 more minutes, but the shrimp was cold, not cleaned properly, and the sauce was tasteless like some unsalted vegetable broth. Luckily, we got it off our check since we were dissatisfied. We came in last night and ordered the wings as our appetizer, the oxtail fried rice, and the braised pork belly. Our server asked us if we wanted to have the appetizer come out first or have it all come out at the same time as the entrees. We asked to have it come out first. After waiting, we both receive our entrees both from different servers for whatever reason. Our wings came out 10 minutes after the entrees which wasn't a big deal, but it made the server look bad. All the food was so delicious, but we noticed that our server just seemed to act like she wasn't even serving our table anymore which is funny because I don't know how hard it is to serve ONE table. She would walk by and avoid eye contact and we kept trying to get her attention by raising our hand and etc. We ended up having to ask other servers for a to go box and the check since we were waiting for almost 20 minutes to grab her attention but she was too busy talking to her friend/co-worker who was standing right near our table. Since the other servers didn't bring us what we needed my boyfriend stood up and acted like he was about to leave and she still didn't give two shits to the point where we could have dine and dashed. He had to basically ask her loudly for a to go box and the check since she started walking away from the area of our table after she was done talking to her friend then she asks us if we want dessert. Are you kidding? She is a fucking joke of a server. Serving is such an easy job especially if you only have ONE table. I don't like tipping badly because I'm a server myself, but she didn't deserve the normal 20%. I know she wasn't new because I've seen her before so she needs to be retrained or something.",

If you have 80% empty tables and three groups of people standing by the host stand with no host in sight, there is a problem right there. Having multiple groups of people waiting near the entrance for over 15 min just for an empty restaurant is incredibly disrespectful and rude. After making eye contact with multiple waitresses no one seemed to care to come over and give us an idea of the preposterous situation. It is only after I personally call a waiter to come over will they then come and acknowledge our ridiculous wait. I then asked, do we wait for a host or do we just seat ourselves, and the waiter replies, let me call someone over. This tedious process of waiting to get seated at an empty restaurant shows incompetence and a lack of quality in the staff. Our group then left the restaurant because we understood that our business was not welcome there.",

    "text": "Biggest problem which will be a disaster to one unsuspecting customer one day (like a child, senior or disabled person): Currently, their handrail exceeds the width of the platform you must walk on to get to your table. This gives the illusion that there is no drop off/step down when in fact the drop off is over a foot deep between the step off and the handrail. The whole purpose of a rail is for people to hold onto it and to prevent them from falling off of a ledge. Here, if you reach for the handrail, you fall off the ledge. One member of our party who had recently undergone knee surgery, almost fell off the platform due to the handrail illusion which would have been disastrous. I hope the restaurant fixes this and takes this seriously before someone gets seriously hurt. Inconsistent food with good service. Atmosphere is cool and light-hearted.",

We ordered an order of 6 garlic pepper wings, among other things. At 11:55, the wings are brought out to us. At 12:00, the waitress brings us a happy hour menu, on which the wings we ordered are $0.50 each. On the regular menu an order of 6 wings is $6.95. We had not touched the wings yet, and the waitress claims she didn't realize what time it was. I asked if we could pay the happy hour menu price for the wings. She asked the manager and the answer is no because she had put the order in before it was happy hour. COME ONNNNNNNN. You didn't even mention that happy hour was coming up. You know if you were the customer, you would feel somewhat cheated... I wish this experience wouldn't have happened because I really like this place....",

    "text": "Love the ambiance and location (don't dig that parking is 60 minutes max and impossible to find on a weekend), and the greeters got us seated immediately on a busy weekend. The food is a swell Asian fusion that is cheaper than expected for a swanky industrial-club like atmosphere (seems like a great place to bring a first-date). However, the food was not as OMG as some of the yelp reviews had persuaded me to believe. My steak and egg rice plate was not bad, and the portion size of stir-fried beef, a soft-fried egg, and ketchup fried rice was just right. But the flavors were just okay, about on par with any decent Chinese restaurant. But for $14.95 (their online menu prices are out of date), I wasn't blown away. Our party of six stayed well past finishing our meals, and the servers were attentive and didn't rush us. There was a server error however, where we ordered the oxtail fries but they mistakenly brought us something that may have been garlic fries. We ate a few before we noticed the mistake, and when we let the server know, he took the half-eaten garlic fries away and made us wait for the correct order. I know it varies from place to place, but I'm used to servers leaving the wrong dish on the table as a comp when they make a mistake--especially when it's an appetizer that they're just going to throw away anyway (hopefully \\:0 ). Oh well. When the oxtail fries finally arrived, they smelled great--but honestly, they weren't anything really revelatory. I assume their fries aren't fresh-cut. They seemed frozen, but I could be wrong. Their service was fast and friendly, and the prices were okay, and they have that hipster factor going on. I'm not opposed to going back--would like to try out their spin on pho.",

The lobster pho was a fun and different concept, and they do serve a generous portion of lobster. Other than the lobster itself, the pho tasted like a beef broth pho. I expected it to taste more like lobster, or at least, seafood. The chicken pho is served with dark meat, not white. Not sure if white meat is optional. The steak and egg was good. The soft shell crab is good except the ponzu sauce that was served with the soft shell crab did not taste like the traditional ponzu sauce. Their papaya salad also didn't taste like the traditional papaya salad. The spring rolls were good. The worst item we ordered was the kimchi. They totally missed the flavor. All in all, if I want to eat Pho or any other Asian dish, I would go to authentic Asian places. This place was more Asian fusion.",

They also carry such a large collections of wines, beers and Japanese whiskey. U gotta try Japanese whiskey such as hibiki, oh my it;s so smooth and trust me, no hangover the next day.  We ordered a lot of items on the menu, overall we are pretty content about the foods.  Oysters with house special sauce is very fresh, the tobiko on top adds a different texture to the oysters, we totally love it.  They said they only serve fresh crawfishes. Yup, no frozen crawfishes for me! Their sauce is less intense than other places in town. But i love it, less garlicky feeling the next day thank you! Tamarin crab was good. I wished the sauce was a little thicker but its still good, a balance between sour, sweet and salty. Yum yum! Their egg rolls serve hot and crispy. They have taro inside, my favorite in town. Their beef wrapped in betel leaves are yummiest. You can taste the lemon grass in every bite. It's very moist and well seasoned. It goes so well with the green onion and peanuts on top. We tried the pho oxtail and both agreed that its totally authentic. The broth is richer than other places, not too strong of the pho spices. It is not easy to make a good pho broth, you can kill it when putting too much spices. This place got it right, got it right! Oh and their beef carpaccio, I have never had it this way before. The truffle oil is such a smart move. I enjoy every bite of it, the beef melts in my mouth. Overall there are some room for improvement but for such a new opening place, it deserves a five stars.",

When  he came back he said there was no cream so I said forget the coffee bring me my soup. Finally it came it was a big bone soup, I was imagining  all the bone marrow  that I was getting I was so excited, I put my knife  inside the bone no marrow.  The other bone had a little  so I was ok until someone  ask me how the food was I told her about the situation  and she totally agreed  with me, she went to the kitchen  to talk to the chef and the answer was  it depends on the cut of the bone. The name of the soup was big bone soup the description  said it has marrow on it. But there was a tiny tiny marrow in this humongous bone. I'm sorry but I'm not coming back.  By the way the service was good but I  drove there  twice for the bone  marrow soup. For me it didn't  happen.",

I wanted to be surprised so I didn't even look on Yelp before coming to check them out. When I arrived, my friends already had a table and started on drinks. Guess we were drinking first before eating lol. Boy did we drink! Customer service was excellent the entire night. The staff was very friendly.   I quickly glanced at the menu while drinking and knew I wanted their The Original Whole Maine Lobster Pho. It was 1.5 lbs of Maine Lobster over pho so it was massive. Gotta be Vegas. It was Market Price so it'll change from time to time on price. The broth was delicious and sweet. Great lobster flavor. There was just the perfect amount of noodles in the bowl. I saw the table next to us order the The Big Bone Soup and it looked insane. It'll be my order next time I'm in Vegas. Maybe both so I can have Surf and Turf.",

I am also delighted that my $49 bowl of Lobster Pho have bite size pieces of lobster already deshelled - no hard to get to hidden lobster meat to break your teeth over - and done just right.     I gobble it all up and shovel in the remaining broth in less than ten minutes. Still hungry, I order another plate of $12.99 Whole Grilled Squid. Perfectly cook; taste like chewy lard confection.

Thank you District One for a great dinner and great service! Also, make sure you share. We've been here before while visiting Vegas and there is always left over food. They give healthy portions. They are super accommodating. We asked for 4 separate checks and did it with a smile. As an ex server I hated to do that. Lol  It's nice to get out of the strip area and have a great dinner.",

This District One (D1) joint is the opposite of that routine.  They are all over the news & is one of the top Las Vegas restaurants.  In Sai Gon (Viet Nam),  District 1 is where all the actions are, and features some of the best cuisines of the country.  This D1 restaurant represents well what Sai Gon has to offer; really brought us close to home!  They feature some of the most authentic Vietnamese dishes with a twist in style or presentation.  They are comfort foods that you come in not necessarily because you are hungry, but because you crave some of the dishes that mom & grandma haven't cooked in awhile.  This joint is owned & operated by my friend, Chef Khai Vu.  I tell ya what, I am really glad that I loved everything that I ate there, so now I can wholeheartedly endorse this restaurant & truthfully feel great about backing it! By the way, neither Chef Khai Vu nor his wife ask me to write any of this.  In fact, they have no idea I am writing this review.  Also, D1 frequently hosts watch party for live sports event, so follow them on Facebook for event announcements & special offers.  There's a lil something for everyone at D1; I guarantee it!",

District One has come into its own.  The menu has been refined.  The list of cocktails greatly improved.  Outstanding selection of Japanese whiskey and other brown libations.  Inviting with all the elements to back up a great experience.  To start, sea snails in a beautifully infused chili, basil, lemongrass broth is outstanding.  Chewy as they should be, the broth has the distinct smell of the sea (like boiling stones collected from the ocean) with good herbaceous overtones greatly enhances the flavor.  The Vietnamese beef carpaccio is different in a good way.  Thin slices of beef are arranged on a plate, lightly torched before being drowned with sesame, citrus, and soy.  Basil, mint, a bit of truffle oil all enhance the minearality of the beef.  Crushed peanuts and thin slics of onion add texture.  A squeeze of fresh lime makes the flavors explode.  The grilled whole squid so simple and so good.  Plump, not very tender but not dried.  Light charred bitterness and aggressive seasoning.  It doesn't need the accompanying spicy aioli (taste like siracha and mayo)  For larger dishes, the fried whole fish.  Deep fried, finished in a sweet tangy sauce supported by raw onions, fresh cilantro, and green pickled papaya.  Good eats.  Some places are overcooked and slightly tough, it adds to the rustic nature of the dish.  The lobster pho (whole 1.5lb Maine lobster) remains excellent; the broth becoming incredibly rich and flavorful if you mix in the tamale of the lobster.  Eat this quick else the tail rapidly overcooks and becomes tough.    Finally, the \"Big Bone Soup\" remains very good.  Loads of marrow and great extraction make for an unctious soup that delivers on flavor.  Very good, attentive service with just the right amount of casual familiarity.  Excellent libation list and well made craft cocktails that perfectly match their flavors.  Solid, solid, solid and worthy as one of the best \"modern\" Vietnamese eateries in the city.",

    "text": "When in Vegas, we always love to dine out and this place was on the radar of one of our friends from Nor. Cal.  This place with over 1,400 reviews was all the buzz of the town. It's pretty much go BIG or go home for this place and their menu went big with the Steak and Lobster Pho.   Although we didn't get any of that, we as a group of 16 that came in at 10pm was easily accommodated.  Even though we sat in 2 split tables, I thought the service was excellent. They came back for water refills, drink orders, and was not hesitant about splitting checks due to our large Cali family that meets once a year in Vegas. I also appreciate that even though we had as a group of 16, they didn't automatically charge us the 18% tip and thus, we gave them 20% since we appreciate that kind of service.   As for the food, here's the sketchy part. Some items I do feel was a little overpriced. Ordered a Pho Tom for $11.99 and it came with about 5 shrimps. So value wise, it was not great and taste wise, it was just okay.   However, the Oxtail Fried Rice was excellent. It comes with a perfectly cooked egg on top and though it was $16, it was terrific. Also ordered the Spicy Hue noodle soup. Their shank was excellent though it was sliced thin and there wasn't enough of it. It is spicy, maybe a 7 out of 10. The broth was excellent as well.   Love the flavors here, just a little torn about how much you get for the price. But I would definitely come back here, perhaps with a large group again so we can share other items from the menu. The shared parking lot at night took a little effort, so you have to be a little patient finding that spot.",

    "text": "I've wanted to like District One, but that may be the reason why I was disappointed with their food. A modern Vietnamese restaurant that has the city talking and even some of the country talking with their introduction to whole lobster pho a few years back.  I didn't dig the interior. It reminds me of Boiling Crab with the log looking tables and wall fixtures. The emphasis on sports and drinking with all of the TV's make it an option to watch sporting events.  The thing about District One is that their pho broth wasn't good. We tried two bowls of pho, oxtail fries, and egg rolls. I had this thought in my head that they really had this modern Vietnamese restaurant that improved on a classic and elevated it, but the pho was so bland. With Vietnamese pho I am a purist. I add my veggies and that's it: no fish sauce no hot sauce, nothing. I had to hook my broth up so much to make it decent. The oxtail fries were good with lots of oxtail meat, but not as good as Bachi's. The egg rolls were so small and the filling very dry and at $9 for 4 pieces was a hard no from me.  I have to give them props on their staff. They have a lot of staff and they are very attentive-you're not only helped by one person.  At the end of the day I would not go back to District One for pho. If I want a good bowl of pho I would definitely try somewhere else. I recommend stepping the broth game up otherwise nothing is enticing.",

As we entered in (around 12:40pm) the restaurant not really packed. We signed in with party of 6 and the owner (or probably the manager) said the wait time about 25 mins. However, it took us more than one hour to get a table. (We got a table around 1:55p) We don't mind about the wait may be a little bit longer. But the thing is we saw they took the customers came AFTER us in first, just because they have the RELATIONSHIP with the owner, so they got priority? WE DON'T like that. It's not fair!!! Anyway, you have lose us (and many our friends) as your valued customers in the future. There are still many good pho places around here. We rather go to the places that respect and treat customers fairly. And now we just realized they gave us a wrong bill.  They over charged us. We ordered 6 bowls of oxtail pho, 4 side of rare steak on the side, 4 Vietnamese coffee, 1 fried rice and 1 grilled squid.   I would give this place 0 star but the waiters were nice. ESP, thank you the guy who took our orders and served us nicely.",

I known district one restaurant through social media for their lobster pho.  Visiting Vegas this week and I  pay a visited to them. It was a disappointed experiences.  The restaurant was packed on a Monday night. A waitress sat me at the bar and I ordered the lobster pho,the sea snail dish and a coconut cocktail. She then told me that the market price for the lobster is $45 and I said ok. The foods came out at a  fairly time. The lobster pho tasted very mediocre with full of msg on the broth. The bowl have little noodles . Lobster meats only have a few pieces in the pho. The waitress never gave me any bean sprouts, basils, hot peppers for the pho. Very bad practice of services consider this place sell pho the most on their menu. The waiter should be educated and train how to serve pho to their customers. I thought the reviews about this place are very over rated and they foods are expensive compared to other pho restaurants in the area.",

It's modernized for the American and young crowd, but you can still taste the original cooking style within the sauce and broth. It might be on the pricey side but it was definitely worth the experience.  I had the Steak and Eggs which is basically Bo luc lc and I gotta say it was great. The steak was tender, juicy and had that similar taste of A1 sauce while the fried rice complimented the beef really well. It balanced out the rich taste of the sauce. The portion size was comparable to the price.  If you're in Vegas and don't mind taking a 10 minute ride off the strip, I would recommend coming here.",

This is what pho should taste AND smell like.  District One caters to a young, cool crowd of Asian hotties, is clean, and has an attentive staff.  Their prices are very reasonable.

And that means fresh pho!  At first glance at their menu, their pho a little bit more pricier than most places but the broth seemed to have a little more flavor than other noodle bars that I've previously had before. It's also a little bit more salty for my own tastes, but comes with plenty of meat to fill you up.  I also got to sample their cooked ika (squid) with spicy mayo sauce. It's not bad and has a decently charred crust layer to chewy squid ratio on it. While glancing their appetizer menu, the prices can add up pretty quickly but I'm sure they're a decent discount on their happy hour times. Call me cheap but I just felt for a pho place though, most of the items seemed a little more outside my casual dining-post college grad-hard not life-price range.  The interior is clean and comfortable, but service was slightly slow. Maybe I just came at a bad time? I wouldn't mind stopping by again one day if I'm close by and too lazy to drive elsewhere, but it didn't really seem much to me to be a stand out from the crowd kinda place tbh.  District one felt more like a district three star out of five. But maybe I can try it again later on and have a change of heart?",

We ordered two different ones that they offered (one was lobster and beef pho, and the other was just lobster pho) and an oxtail fried rice. Surprisingly, I actually like the oxtail fried rice more.  I didn't like the lobster pho as much because I expected the broth to have some lobster or seafood taste to it. It was a good base for regular pho, but not good enough for lobster pho. I wish there was more seafood/freshness in its broth. It just felt like they boiled the lobster and placed it into the pho--meh. Disappointed. BUT THE OXTAIL FRIED RICE! AHH! It was really good. They definitely did a good job with that--please do yourself a favor and order that okay? Yes.  I like the way this place is set up and the staffs are super nice. As I was walking out of here, I saw many interesting dishes that people ordered. When I come back to Vegas, I definitely would LOVE to come back here! Eating the lobster pho once is enough, after all it's MP and with was $50 at the time of our purchase. Not worth $50!",

This place was recommended by a friend of mine but since it was cold and rainy out.. decided to have something warm for lunch.  Oxtail soup - Im a biggggg fan now. Ever since I had their oxtail soup.. I've actually started making it at home because of this. I love how there is soooo much flavor packed into the broth. Its $15 for a bowl and you get 3 big pieces of oxtail (which is a lot more then most places who serve oxtail). Very filling and worth coming back.  Shaken Beef Salad - my mother-in-law ordered this dish because she wanted something light. But the portion was pretty big for one person. Again.. the meat was packed with flavor and balances out with the salad.   Coconut pork belly - my husband ordered this plate and I tried a piece of it. It came with CHUNKS of pork belly which is always a plus!!! Very sizeable portion & delicious.  Since it was my birthday the restaurant gave me a complimentary coconut ice cream served in a coconut. Light but sooo goooooddd. I especially liked that it was served in a coconut so you can shave a little bit of coconut into your ice cream. Not overly sweet but super creamy. Wish I could bring a gallon of this ice cream back home",

Apparently, it was on Buzzfeed, but Buzzfeed hypes up spots so easily and it's really not that great.  My friends from OC and LA said good things and I was like okay, let's give it a try.  First off, I am not a fan of fusion food.  It takes off the authentic taste of the origin. I am not against the idea, but I am just not into it.  I looked at the Lobster Pho and it just seems extra and not tasty, so I didn't bother. I've tried it before, and I was just not happy with it.  Today, luckily we went with 8 people so I was able to try various options. Oxtail Pho - Soup was bland, had no flavor. Eggrolls - I don't know why my basket had so much Basil and Mint. (Yes, I know how to eat Eggrolls correctly) I practically am Vietnamese. Oxtail Fried Rice - This was the only dish which had flavor. But wow, there was so much oil .... was it the Chinese Sausag?? Steak and Eggs - It's basically the Shaken Beef plate. Rice was bland, the beef was sauteed with vegetable... but it wasn't mind blowing or anything. Double down - Garlic noodle... I didn't taste any of the garlic in there. The meat was all whatever.  Overall, there was just no flavor. Presentation is important but what's the point if the food doesn't pull through?",

    "text": "So we are in Vegas, tired of the buffets and the high end dinners, so we stopped by this place after seeing a video on Buzzfeed.   We ordered the lobster pho (for us, it was $49) and oxtail fried rice.   To be honest, both of the dishes were pretty salty, the fried rice being a little more bearable, so we politely complained and they remade our lobster pho and to apologize for the inconvenience, they gave us a creme brulee dessert.   The oxtail fried rice was BOMB (despite it being salty) I would 100 percent recommend this dish.  As for lobster pho..  if you like lobster and pho, it might be a good choice for you, but honestly,  it wasn't that special.    O, and the creme brulee is so worth it.  Get it!! Fyi, happy hour from 5~7. Look at my pics for the happy hour menu.",

A modern, hip take on a pho restaurant, District One offers items that take it up one level.  They are known for their lobster pho, which features a whole in the bowl!  It's quite tasty, and the broth has a delicate balance of traditional pho and the exquisite flavor of lobster!  However, set at market price, it has pretty hefty price tag, typically above $40 a bowl.  I recommend getting a bowl for the table and sharing it along with another item per person.  The Bone, which features a hearty serving of bone marrow in pho broth is a delicious go to! Use a straw to slurp the marrow out!!! Does not come with noodles.  If you are looking for something more traditional, the Oxtail Pho will hit the spot.  Speaking of oxtail, the oxtail fried rice is one of my favorite things here!   They have Hennessy Privilege in two here!  I suggest you get it! There is also a Hennessy iced coffee which is insanely delicious!  It's Vegas after all!",

We shared the prime rib pho, spring rolls, lemongrass beef, and the shrimp skewer.  For two people, it was PLENTY of food.  The spring rolls were delicious and the peanut sauce is excellent.  The beef was succulent and very flavorful.  The pho is a huge bowl with lots of meat.  The fresh vegetables served with the pho were very fresh and crisp.  Excellent.  The only disappointment was the shrimp -- sadly, there was only one shrimp.  We wished for more.  Add two beers (drafts) and we were done.  Friendly service and knowledgeable staff.  We'll be back, as always.",

    "text": "All right earlier tonight after driving around we ended up at District One in Las Vegas on Jones just off of Spring Mountain. We decided to give this place another try after a few months. To start we ordered the garlic fries which has fresh crushed garlic and Cajun seasoning. We  ordered the fries well-done extra crispy and they came out soggy I wasn't a fan.  We  ordered the fish tacos which was yellowtail sashimi, Avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomatoes. The tacos were delicious we were  very happy they had a unique wonton taco shell which really made the dish no complaints. Next we ordered the belly buns which was braised pork belly, Cilantro, and peanuts with a typical bun. I was very disappointed with them they need a lot of work, they are average at best. Next we tried the Oxtail  Fried Rice which had Shredded Oxtail meat, red onion, soy sauce and a fried egg. Another disappointment they said it was one of their more popular dishes but failed to deliver amongst our table. Lastly we tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio which consists of beef carpaccio, citrus soy, sesame oil, truffle oil, white onions, basil and peanuts. This was very good, nothing that I would completely rave  about but very good. No complaints I would order it and the tacos again for sure. Pros: Good food, cool atmosphere, good crowd and they're open late. Cons: although some of the dishes are good the rest of menu definitely needs some work. They really could be doing better. The staff seemed a little distracted with each other talking and on their phones at times and not really paying attention to a lot of the tables my friends and I had to wait a few times for water and drinks. After ordering appetizers our waiter disappeared for at least 15 minutes before he came back to take our entree order. Lastly no wifi this is always a bother considering it's 2017 and every business should offer it to their patrons. We are leaving disappointed for a second time which is very frustrating. This place has so much potential and they keep dropping the ball. If they step their game up and improve the menu and food quality we would go all the time. As of now they have two strikes against them and I don't want there to be a third. We will give them another chance in a month or so and we will see. As of now they get a C maybe even a C-",

Traditional bun bo hue has pork knuckle, pork blood and beef shank, but they skip the two former and keep the latter. The broth wasn't too spicy, but you can ask for this chilli paste, which elevates the spice level by a lot if you'd like. I tried out some of my friend's oxtail fried rice, and that was delicious, ox tail meat, and an egg served however you like. I will definitely order that the next time I am in town.   The restaurant itself is pretty big, plenty of parking in the plaza they are in. Tons of TVs set up so you can catch the game and what not. They also have other delicious looking items, like king crab, soft shell crab, oysters, spring rolls, oxtail fries...etc",

We ordered the calamari, papaya salad, Serrano chicken wings, and pork buns. Calamari was decent but I think I got more fried jalapeno slices than calamari. The wings were completely overrated.  Came out burnt with no seasonings other than some diced Serrano peppers sprinkled on top (no lie). The papaya salad was different being a soy sauce and seasoned oil base instead of the traditional lime.  I'm still up in the air on that one.  The pork buns were pork buns, nothing to write home about.  The best part of the whole meal were my kids meal. We ordered the short rib with Chinese sausage entree which came out looking pretty good.  Overall the place looks like a really nice place to hang out with some friends and chit chat over a few brews. Food wise I can find better places to spend my money on.",

Asian Fusion is what drew us to this place.   Their claim to fame is here is the lobster pho ($33 mkt price today) which of course I did not order!  Fish Sauce  Hot Wings 5*.  For those of you who do not know, this is the business. I know it sounds strange but the fish sauce glaze was very well put together and gave the wings a subtle salty flavor.   Oxtail Loco Moco 3* This dish was very deceiving as it was not a True loco moco. I was expecting the hamburger patty smothered in the oxtail gravy and topped with an egg. Instead, all I got was oxtail gravy and an egg. So basically it was just gravy rice topped with an egg.    Oxtail fries 4*  I like their rendition of the oxtail fries. It was generous serving. the gravy was loaded with the  oxtail meat and not just essence of oxtail like those other guys (bachi)  Spring Rolls 4* These were your standard fair spring rolls. They were served the real way with leafy lettuce to wrap them up and eat with. On point!  Vietnamese Carpaccio 3* This was a very cool and different take on traditional carpaccio. It was like eating the raw beef steak that comes with pho.  .      Birdnest Noodles 3* This was the \"safe\" dish that we ordered. Nothing wow about this one. It was Hong Kong style crispy noodles topped with veggies, meat and gravy. This is my favorite type of noodle dish hands down so it was a win for me.     I enjoyed all of the food that we ordered and think that we got a good sample of what this place is all about! I give this place credit in the creativity and skill in creating these dishes. Vietnamese food is very strong in flavor and can often be overpowering for the novice eater. This place is a good starter for those who aren't familiar with Vietnamese food but want to give it a try. For those of us who grew up on these flavors this place is a breath of fresh air from the traditional...  I Likey...  Eat with confidence....",

It was open and reminded me of a couple of hipsterish places in New Orleans I frequented (e.g., Cochon Butcher).    - The service was solid and very helpful with those that have dietary restrictions - The wings were crispy and tangy and the jalepeno/chili sauce accompaniment was very nice.  Nicely balanced tang and spiciness - The spring rolls were above average.  The mint was a little stronger and the shrimp were larger.  Nice mix - The beef fried rice was delicious.  The beef was shredded rather than cubed and had a nice meaty and rich flavor.  Mixing it with the egg and some sriracha and I was in heaven",

We honestly kept joking around that we would drive out to vegas just to eat here. But the last few times we've come in, it feels like the quality has gone down. I'll start off by saying that out of the last 3 times we came in (once in June, July and August) they were always out of the bone marrow soup. The beef carpaccio (which was our FAVORITE dish...I had dreams about this dish), was just ok. It didn't seem to have the same amount of flavor it had the first two times we came. The pork belly buns always came out with dry pork and one of the days we had lunch, my husband ordered a fresh coconut and was given one that had absolutely NO coconut meat inside! He waved down a server and asked them if they reused the shells, and she said absolutely not and promptly gave him a new coconut....and lo and behold, this one actually had coconut meat. Maybe it was just a coincidence...but he hasn't ordered coconut juice here since.",

The pho here is decent at best, but they have other items worth noting.  Oxtail fries - delicious!! I love this here and its a nice change if you don't want noodles or rice dishes. The meal is very tender and flavorful, topped with a nice crisp egg cooked over easy.   Spring rolls - These were really good. I really enjoyed that they put the crunchy eggroll wrap in there that usually is in nem nuong.   Pork belly buns- My favorite thing here! The buns were delicious and the pork belly slices were melt in your mouthhhh.   Garlic noodles - I added chicken for 3.00. This was my entree but the most disappointing. The noodles were p bland and flavorless with only a hint of garlic and the chicken did not make it any better. I had to add soy sauce.. Incredibly disapointing, I would not recommend this at all.   Service was good and attentive and the ambience is nice. Very clean and spacious establishment",

The location is right in the heart of Chinatown but it doesn't make you feel like it...like you're cramped in a small restaurant, touching elbows with the next couple. It's very spacious - you have options of sitting at the bar, nicely spaced out tables, or booths accommodating large groups.   We're addicted to pho hence our regular check-ins here! This is one of our favorite spots in town. Pho Tai Nam is my go-to dish to order. The secret is in the broth and it is delicious. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loves to mix it up. He likes the Pork Belly Buns, Hot Pepper Wings, and always has room to devour those Crispy Egg Rolls. I think the Vietnamese Coffee is to die for.  I love Happy Hour!

You get a whole lobster chillin in your bowl of pho and he just stares back at you as if he were saying \"eat me!\" The broth itself was lobster in flavor and it was delicious. My boyfriend can vouch for that because he's Vietnamese :) Our friends ordered pork belly buns, pho tai rib eye, and steak and eggs and were pleased with their dishes. District One gives out generous servings and their service is quick and great. I might have to make this a traditional spot to eat at every time I'm in Vegas.

Restaurant was clean and very modern, great vibe, and servers were very well accommodating throughout our whole stay. They kept checking up on us making sure we enjoyed our food and not in the ridiculously nagging way, either! Our first time there, we sat at the bar and the Bartender was one of the owners/managers? She was very friendly and gave us the rundown on what their specialities were and a little background on the restaurant as well!  Food: Both time, for those Sunday Vegas Hangover Cures, I've gotten the oxtail pho. Omgggg, to die for, honestly. Also, their broth is a bit different from other Pho restaurants I've been too, but not in the bad way!  They are also known for their lobster pho, which I have yet to try, but I am sure trying it the next time I go. I've also tried their Vietnamese Coffee, and that definitely lived up to expectations. For those that know the Sunday traffic on the 5 going towards California, definitely order the Viet Coffee, if you had a long weekend!  All in all, I'm always really excited when we get to stop by District One!",

The answer...hook up with a buddy who knows how to cut through the grime and find us some grub. Who knew we would find grub so good we would come back three times in a span of 24 hours kind of grub because that is exactly what I did here.   This place is unique. You see the word \"fusion\" tossed around now a days like casual sex at pool parties. But this is fusion at its best. It's fusion because for the most part it has stayed True to what it is. You have your choice of pho here but not like anywhere else. Here a few things stick out like ox tail, lobster, and ribeye pho. Crazy right? Then they have the big bone marrow soup, which is exactly that but hot damn it's good. I have come back three times now for the ox tail fried rice. This is perfection. It's carefully blended ox tail soaked up in every particle of rice topped with an egg over easy. It's awesome and flawless. I would not do anything to change this but ask for more. I tried the ox tail fried rice and put it in a bowl. I then topped the bowl with broth from the bone marrow soup and I think I died for a moment. It was definitely a few moments in time that paused because my taste buds didn't know how to process the information my taste receptors were communicating.  Also tried their wings here, and spring rolls. Those were delicious. I wanted to get to the garlic noodles but I couldn't make myself move past the fried rice.  I'm still here so who knows? Maybe I'll make it for a 4th time before leaving?  Update: yes we did make it a 4th before leaving Vegas. So four times in 48 hours.   Now you go try it and you try not to come back 4 times. Tell Kai the owner how much you love it and he might just give you shots of Jameson.",

The best part is that all of these great things come at a great price. I always feel like I get more value then I pay for. Only draw back is the parking on weekend. It gets really crowded in the parking lot because of all the other businesses but I brave it to visit this awesome place.",

    "text": "4 stars is what this place averages and rightly so. With quite a few traditional Asian restaurants in this center and across the street this place offers traditional Asian dishes with a twist.   Had the oxtail fried rice - excellent. A bit greasy, but it's OXTAIL!  Chicken wings - meh......could use a little kick of something either spicy or sweet, they were just kind of there   Bao - good, missing something to stand out and knock you off your seat, but good  Bone marrow soup - good. Wife thought it was too salty, I thought it was right. Like the fatty tendon and meat you can pick off. Fun and different.  Service was great. Didn't catch her name but she was very active, filled up water constantly (any foodie knows Asain restaurants usually get an F- on this) but she was great! Helped us pack up our take home and did it all with a smile.  Cost wise it was fair. Chicken wings were a bit expensive for what you got, fried rice was well worth the 8 bucks and the soup and bao were fair.  More than anything this place can clean your standard Asain food palette with something different. Will come back and order the fried rice and soup.",

    "text": "Once I heard they served a beautiful dish called \"Lobster Pho,\" I was sold. I made it a mission to include this on my short vacation to Las Vegas.  Nice little setting in a strip mall.  The lights were on the dim side, making it a little more intimate.  I liked the modern decorations/graphics along the walls.  TVs in every corner so we were able to enjoy the basketball game while dining.  They even have a bar if you just want to grab drinks and relax.  Now comes the exciting part, FOOD. Appetizers: Oxtail Fries - 3 stars.  I would compare this to poutine.  Nothing too special in my book. I believe it was $11.99 and for the portion and quality, I wouldn't get it again Shaken Beef Salad -  4 stars.  If you're Cambodian, it definitely reminds me of Loc Lac without the rice.  Delicious flavor and generous portion size but $11.95 could be pricey for most.   House Special Oysters - 5 Stars!  Mmm, they were really fresh and had great flavor!  This definitely made me crave oysters more often. Entrees: Steak  & Egg - 4 stars.  Amazing flavor of the beef on top of lettuce and tomatoes.  Egg cooked to your preference.  We substituted the rice for the garlic noodles which was an additional $3.00, so the dish came to a total of about $15.00.  It was good but I don't know if it was worth $3.00 good.   Lobster Pho - 4 stars.  Boy, did I enjoy that lobster.  It is based on market price and ended up being $40.00 when I went.  They give you the entire lobster, head included with the meat cut up so its more convenient for consumption.  The broth was okay.  Of course you can't expect beef broth pho so it was a little different on my pallet.  They also didn't bring bean sprout and didn't have limes so I had to resort to lemons.. meh.  Great food experience but I'm not sure I would get it again for that price.  Service was a little slow, granted we were a big group.  They were only able to split the check 4 ways.   It wasn't too busy when we went, which was a Saturday night.  Dining here was definitely an experience!",

Fantastic choice! We have 7 girls and 1 guy.  We definitely ordered the whole entire kitchen.  Almost all the appetizers, small dishes, and then individual orders!  Love the fried calamari, love love LOVE the oxtail fried rice!!!  it was so good that I, personally, ordered another one!  The pork belly bun was good, but not the best.  Typical spring rolls and egg rolls.  We ordered oysters on a half shell, that was a big disappointment and we all love oysters.  It did not taste...good.  not bad, but definitely not good.  We didn't even finish it.  So we all ordered individual entrees aside from the 20 dishes we had already.  I ordered the Marrow bone soup dish...thing.  I love bone marrow and I just had to have it.  While I'm chomping on the oxtail fried rice, main entree is trickling in.  Wondering where's mine and all of a sudden my friend's eyes looked like a pug.  Just sticking out like it's reaching for something.  I turned around and I saw this monolithic prehistoric bone sticking out of a bowl.  \"Marrow Bone Soup\" they called out.  Whoa, it's my dish.  I think I had a T-rex bone marrow.  Two giant bone sticking out of my bowl.  I didn't even know how to tackle it, but hey, I love food and I'm not ashamed of it.  I ate it like a True rockstar, my hands and a straw.  Absolutely devine!  I was so happy and enjoying my \"bone\", hahahaha.  Friends took pictures of me left and right.  It was on point, to perfection.  I definitely enjoyed that dinner.  So if you're there, order the oxtail fried rice, fried calamari, and the marrow bone soup and you'll be just fine.  Man, now I was to go back just for it!",

    "text": "Sometimes fate has a way of getting you where you need to be.  After aimlessly driving in the rain to find out my destination was closed, I found myself checking nearby restaurants on, you guessed it, the Yelp app when District One popped up.  Long bookmarked but not previously sampled I pulled a u turn and made a very good food decision.    First off, I have never felt so welcome in a restaurant.  First the hostess greated me and proceeded to ask how I was doing before explaining the concept of Asian Fusion.  She escorted me to the bar where I had a personal flat screen and she told me to ask if I wanted to change channels.  The bartender Adrian (sp?) was also amazing.  She took time taking my order, was way more knowledgeable about the menu than most bartenders need to be and was happy to explain the options.  She recommended the oxtail fried rice and the fish taco appetizer.  She even discouraged me from ordering additional food items as the rice was a large portion instead of letting me waste my money. I was also impressed that she asked about food allergies.  The fish tacos arrived three small wonton tacos with what can only be described as a light and crisp cerviche.  The flavor was amazing and it was the perfect appetizer as it was not too filling but really pleased the taste buds.  The oxtail fried rice came with a fried egg on top.  At Adrian's recommendation I got mine runny which really helped the flavor spread through the rice.  The rice itself had a large portion of oxtail mixed in and a great mix of flavors.    I wanted to lick my plate clean when finished the flavors were so good.  However, she was right and I was full, so glad I didn't order any other dishes.  I highly recommend this place.  For those of us who budget, the rice was $12.99, and the entire meal, with a beer came to $30.00.",

The staff is very pleasant and the food is delicious. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is...   1) We arrived around 3:30pm and the sunlight was bouncing off the cars in the parking lot, right into our faces. They have shades but didn't have them rolled down. Booths line the windows and were full with patrons so it might have been inconvenient for them to pull them down right then. The windows span the entire restaurant though.    2) I tried the oxtail pho. It tasted amazing but the meat was still on the bone. Getting the meat off was a little difficult and it was also boiling hot. I don't know if my expectations are too high but I don't enjoy burning my fingers to get the meat off. I tried with a fork but it was too hard. I wouldn't mind it on the bone if the meat was falling off.   We also tried the pork sticky buns, beef lemongrass wrapped in grape leaf, and ribeye pho. All were amazing! I did notice that the ribeye pho broth was definitely different than the oxtail. The ribeye was a little darker and heavier. The oxtail lighter overall. Both very good just different. This place is a must try if in Vegas!",

    "text": "I'm not a fan. I stopped in based on Yelp reviews -- around 3:15 pm as I was in the neighborhood and needed a snack. I knew from other reviews it was happy hour and there were food specials. I was given the regular menu -- no big deal, maybe they changed happy hour. I ordered the serrano wings (6 for $7.95) and a side of steam rice ($1.50). The waiter then showed me the specials on a chalkboard -- none of which I was interested in but then I asked what the difference was between the wings on his specials board and the wings that I ordered. He said nothing -- but his price quote was more expensive than the menu he gave me. He really seemed confused and said the price must have dropped. Interesting. Anyway, he then said, what time is it? I said like 3:20, he said oh it's happy hour, there is a happy hour menu. He left, provided it to me, and the wings were $.50 each ($3 for 6), so, then I also decided to order the fried spring rolls ($3.95), and steamed rice. My bill with tip was $11 so, cheap but the food wasn't very good, the wings tasted a bit like chicken liver -- not sure what was happening there. The spring rolls were the highlight but I did not like their sweet chili sauce and asked if they had hot mustard -- they do not. The rice was not quality. It was not sticky, but very separated like American (uncle ben's) rice.  The clincher was -- while I was finishing up. The owner or manager maybe, drove up (Toyota beige truck), parked in the only handicap spot in front (no handicap sign or designation on plate), and walked in the restaurant/pulled up at bar and was still there 20 minutes later when I left. It is totally is rude and annoying when perfectly able body people take the handicap spots (I'm in tuned because my mom is disabled and I drive her around a lot and its annoying that spots are taken by those with no disability and just lazy-asses).",

I decided to give it a try based off all the positive reviews.   First, I wanted a place that was open late because the second part of my night didn't start till much later so I was pleased that they were open until 2.   I loved the interior. It's not typical fancy birthday dinner type of decor (but that's not really my style) It was very relaxed, and even though we were dressed up, we felt very comfortable and we were able to relax and have a good time. I was a little hesistant at first choosing this place because most of my friends had never tried this type of food before but luckily everyone found something to fit their taste buds :)   Our server Jason was very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. A couple of my friends got spring rolls confused with egg rolls, but they took them back with no issue and brought them back what they meant to order :)   I had the fried pork belly buns and the beef pho, which both were super tasty! I'm a lover of soups and this one did not dissapoint. I also tried a peice of my friend's egg roll (very good) and some pork chop from her combonation meal, which was also really good and flavorful (she said it was better than her mom's lol). My sister complimented the chicken wings and said the sauce that came with them was very good. I also tried the chicken fried rice: nice, moist, and had a little kick which I didn't mind. At the end of the evening I recieved the coconut ice cream for my b-day treat...it was delicious! My friends even ordered some for themselves. All in all I had a very good experience that evening and left full and happy:) Thank You District One for making my birthday even more memorable.   If asian fusion is your thing (or if you just want to try something new) I highly recommend trying District One, you won't be dissapointed!",

Food came out expediently as they weren't that busy. We were joking because we thought our waiter went home as we hadn't seen him. We had to pull someone to our table and asked for our waiter as we hadn't seen him since we ordered. He informed us- \"he went home\". OMG-serious ? We started laughing. Then he informed us he was supposed to be taking over but forgot about us. Lol lol lol The service is the reason I won't return",

It's a little further west from the strip but it'd definitely worth the drive, or cab ride.  The interior of the restaurant is more of a sports bar, since they do have a full-service bar at the restaurant. It seems like a great spot to catch a game or two since there are TVs lined throughout the restaurant. The tables are nicely distributed across the restaurant so you don't feel like you're crammed. It's clean throughout the place and the service is exceptional. They definitely go out of their way to make sure you're happy. If I could describe this place in 2 words, I'd called it a \"Hipster Pho\" place.  I got an order of the pho tai rib eye ($9) and I was really happy with my choice. The amount of meat that they give you is really generous; not to mention, the meat is really tasty and tender. On top of that, the broth is really flavorful. It's definitely not 100% free of MSG but you're not complaining when you're eating there in the wee hours.   I'll definitely be back!",

Most of the menu items were named in a way that non-Vietnamese could understand with the exception of standard items like pho.  Ironically, as a person that used to traditional Vietnamese food, I find myself trying to figure out what was the equivalent traditional items.  Unlike most fusion restaurants, The price of the items were not too pricey, compare to the Vietnamese restaurants on Spring Mountain Road.  The most intriguing item on the one-page menu was the Lobster Pho.  It was set as market priced.  I was told that it would be $50 that day.  I didn't have the courage to put down $50 for a bowl of pho but it's interesting to know that it exists.",

    "text": "Some of the girls wanted pho since they were a bit hungover. I'm not a fan of pho but as long as they have vermicelli and other dishes I'm good. We took an uber here but there seemed to be plenty of open parking spaces in the lot. The inside is pretty nice. A definite fancier version of most Vietnamese pho places I been to. It's pretty big and spacious and a bit dim. Very inviting, good setting for big groups. The menu is more updated, instead of just pho. So pretty good for someone like myself who does not want pho. They have a little bit of everything for everyone.  _Crispy Egg Rolls ($8.99) Pork, mushroom, taro. I don't know if it's the taro or a certain oil they fry this in, but this was one of the best crispy egg rolls I've had. The crunch from the egg rolls was nicely fried, the inside was fresh and was nicely packed with ingredients. Simple but lots of flavors, it was a tad sweet and had a nutty flavor to it. I loved the greens that came with it. You can dip the roll in the fish sauce then wrap it in the lettuce, it takes it to another level and makes you feel a little less guilty for eating fried food hahah. _Spring Rolls ($6.99) Shrimp, pork, vermicelli, lettuce, peanut sauce. This was good and pretty standard. The rolls were fresh, the ingredients inside were a generous amount and the flavor was light and subtle. Of course this isn't complete without that yummy sweet and nutty peanut dipping sauce.  _Steak & Egg ($15.99) Shaken beef, white onion, fried egg, tomato rice. I ordered this, since they did not have the vermicelli bowl. I was skeptic to get this at first since most shaken beef I have are always salty. So I asked the waiter if possible to make it less salty or easy sauce. The tomato rice was good, different from white rice, but just adds a nice little sweetness and acidity to the dish. The beef itself was okay, well cooked and all evenly chopped. The sauce was still salty but I've had worse so can't complain. The egg was a bit raw and runny so they were nice enough to recook it a bit more. The dish taste way better with the eggs, when you mix it altogether. This dish overall was okay, I think the rice and egg alone was the best part.  _Baby Bok Choi (8.99) Wok fried, garlic. Pretty good and standard veggies. The garlic flavors were great and tasted really good when I ate it with my shaken beef. _Spicy Pork String Beans ($10.99) Ground pork, chili, green string beans. The whole group loved this. My gg, whom is allergic to garlic ordered this without the garlic, but I guess they forgot the memo. The flavors were great though, lots of garlic aroma, a bit of a kick and the beans itself were perfectly cooked. It had a nice little bite to it, white still being soft as well.  _Coconut Ice Cream. They were nice to give us free desserts for the mess up on the garlic mishap on the green beans. Presentation was pretty. Served on a small coconut bowl. The flavors were light and refreshing, it had a bit of that icy texture to it. There was also small bits of coconut inside and topped with crushed peanuts. I love peanuts so this added an extra roasted flavor to the ice cream. I will say though, the more I ate it, the more it tasted like vanilla ice cream with hints of coconut. Either way a good dessert.  _Green Tea Creme Brulee. This was pretty darn good! The green tea custard was nice and silky. A very subtle hint of green tea. The brulee on top was perfectly caramelized and sweet. A small size which is great to just end the meal.  Service was good, and yes pretty pricey for Vietnamese cuisine, but you are in Vegas so high prices are to be expected. I don't mind paying as long as the food is good. Nothing is worse than overpriced food that isn't even good. I would come here again, and try their popular oxtail pho.",

So my friends and I came to visit while we were in Vegas. I ordered the oxtail fried rice and it was really good! It was a pretty big portion so I took the rest home. My friends and I shared the oysters that were $3.50 each and they were really good! They were better than the bluepoint ones that we got a dozen of but still pretty good. I tried a little bit of what my friends got as well and we were all pleased with what we got. I would def come visit this place again when we visit Vegas!",

If you want only one thing from the menu just to get the big bone soup. It's essentially Pho but with a GIANT beef bone in it,  so you get all that good marrow and tasty bits in your broth.  The spring rolls are delish, and they have a lot of really great beers on tap as well. Service was fast and accurate, and the staff is really friendly. I loved the music selection the night we went.",

    "text": "Came across various reviews on Yelp and Chris V. review actually convince me to give this place a try. So we decided to come last night around 11pm on 7.11.16 for late night dinning.  First of all the atmosphere reminded me of a Joe's Crab Shack just with Asian Influence with a open floor plan with a good size bar. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable with the items they offer. We end up getting an order of Spring Rolls, Shaken Beef Salad and Oxtail Fried Rice. All the dishes we had was great especially the Oxtail Fried Rice. Coming from Hawaii, Oxtail is a staple. This dish was seasoned well and cook to the way fried rice should be, not being too dry and bland. It was balanced and consistent especially with the easy over egg on top.   A few things when going to District One:  -Not a traditional Vietnamese Restaurant but Asian American Fusion style in a modern setting with a Vietnamese twist.  -Menu is only a page long on a clip board but they have an extensive drink menu which was like a small booklet.  - Great place to hangout with a group of friends or family members with open floor plan and large size tables.  - Awesome place to grab a bite after a long day at work and late night dinning.  Will be back to try more of their delicious food and drinks.",

My bowl was tasty as the flavors from the oxtail made it great.  I liked how the meat was cooked and easily comes off the bone. We also ordered the oxtail fries and the beef salad. The fries almost reminded me of poutine fries. They were a bit soggy as the juices/gravy soaked in them. The beef salad was good as the beef was very tender (I wished the pieces were a bit better).",

Been here twice already and have not been disappointed at all. The wait staff are incredibly polite and  courteous. The wife and I have had the Vietnamese Mule, which was tasty and very well done. We have tried the following:   Chicken Pho - The Pho broth is delicious and the wife and son loved it. What my wife liked was how her clothes didn't smell like pho after eating it, like if you go to a normal Pho restaurant.  My son was all about the broth.  Lobster Fried Rice - Outstanding. Incredibly flavorful and presentation was just delightful! Garlic Serrano Fried Chicken -  Fried chicken with a wonderful kick to it. Just delicious!  Oxtail Fries - Heavy but really full of flavor to comfort the palate. Clay Pot Chicken and Rice - just outstanding! 11 year old son loved it.  We look forward to coming again and trying out more things! For what you get and what you pay  - No brainer. This place rivals Mr. Chow or a good handful of restaurants on the strip... IT is just sooooo good...! Try it! You will not be disappointed.",

I wanted lobster pho or the surf and turf pho, but for the price tag of $49 (I think) and $35 respectively, I compromised with oxtail pho which was a lot more reasonable at $14. After all, pho is pho right?  The oxtail soup was clean. It was refreshing and the meat was falling off the bone. Good size meat pieces too.   As the lobster pho passed by, it did look like a legit size/portion and looked AMAZINGLY good, but still don't know if I would be willing to fork out the cash.   The service was good and the menu looked very interesting. I'm looking forward to going back to try other items on the menu.  Update: I went back and had the surf and turf! My friend had the lobster pho. Either way, it was delicious. We also had the oxtail fries and they were just as delicious. Can't really go too wrong here!",

On the most recent visit the wife and I had Pho Oxtail, fish tacos and Steak and Egg Rice.  The wife so enjoyed their Pho last time she quickly selected the Pho Oxtail for her lunch.  I went with the Steak and Egg Rice and we went with the fish tacos for our appetizer.      The fish tacos were good but got to be honest not great.  The lacked the depth of flavor I expected and were kind of bland.  The Steak dish was slightly too salty which but it was a tasty dish.  It was sweet with a little sour taste and paired well with the rice and over easy egg.  I enjoyed the dish but wish the salt was used a little more sparingly.      The highlight of he meal was the Pho Oxtail.  They do some very good Pho and the Oxtail is one of the better ones. The broth was so so good.  It had such a good depth to it.  It was a beef broth with the nice accent of mint in the background.   The mint didn't overpower the dish but was there to add to the delicious flavor.  The meat was plentiful and very tender and good.  The wife was so happy with her choice and she prefers District One's Pho over several other places in town.      I do love their ambiance and have been in later in the evening when the crowd is there to have a mixed drink or two and enjoy some great food. It is a happening place and can get very busy in the evenings and on weekends.  The staff is excellent and took good care of us on both our visits.  Funny thing the daughter had been there with a friend just the day before.  She brought home some leftovers and they were so good that we wanted to have D1 for lunch.  I will gladly be back and look forward to another meal at D1.",

Restaurants these days have the wierdest names!?!? I kept calling this restaurant One Direction!? After finding out the correct name, it still reminded me of The Hunger Games, not a restaurant!?!?  Oh well....  We shared a few apps and started out with the Tamarind Wings and the Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings which were both puny in portion and very underwhelming. We also shared the Beef Carpaccio which was delicious and the star of the appetizers.  For my entree, I ordered the District One Combo Plate with The Kalbi short ribs. I asked to substitute Vietnamese Red Rice with extra garlic. This plate was good, but not great. Nice taste and char on the short ribs, but unfortunately, the rice was red, but kinda bland and there was no extra garlic like I asked for. there also was pieces of Chinese sausage and a little pile of kimchi on the plate as well but seemed like it didn't really flow with the rest of the components.   After getting a taste of Amelinda's Slow Braised Pork Belly in Coconut Water (SO FRICKIN' ONO!!!!!) That would be THE dish I would return for. If you have the chance, order this dish. Don't ask questions, JUST DO IT!!!  ALOHA!!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uu  3.5   *Little more than A-Ok right now with wiggle room for improvement...",

The belly buns were okay. The fish tacos were alright. I liked the egg rolls bc i didnt like anything else. I didnt care for the steak and eggs nor the oxtail fried rice. I tried like 5 different things and they were all eh. I liked the atmosphere and decor tho! I gave a third star bc they let us order happy hour 2 min before it was over. And their pandan creme brulee was actually bomb!",

    "text": "I had pork belly on my mind when I tried this place for lunch, but was a little disappointed to find out that they didn't have any since it was still cooking and it wouldn't be ready until dinner.   Since I had my heart set on pork belly, it took me a little bit to recoup and figure out what to order. I finally decided on the combination rice plate with shortrib and my dining companion opted for the steak and eggs. The food came out pretty quickly, although my dish came out a few minutes before my friends, which was a little annoying. The lobster pho looked good as they were serving it to a neighboring table, so that definitely piqued my interest for my next interest.  I enjoyed my shortribs and everything I tried was solid, just nothing amazing. Service was good but refills were a little hard to come by. I especially enjoyed the kim chee which was on the spicy side. That was my favorite thing about the meal. I still couldn't get the pork belly out of my head, so I'll likely have to come back for that, but I've learned my lesson and will call in advance to make sure that they have it ready before coming in.",

Handled everything (being the only bartender there) very well.. timely and efficiently.  Drinks: Moscow Mule and Vietnamese Donkey BOTH SO GOOD.  Food: Lobster Pho.. 5 stars. Delicious Ox Tail Fried Rice: 5 stars. Really good, and actually had good chunks of meat and a yummy over easy egg on top.  Fried calamari: big portion (we had leftovers) really good kinda spicy dipping sauce!   Overall, 5 million stars",

    "text": "What an expensive Vietnamese pho restaurant. What they are advertising is their ox tails. Almost everything is ox tails.  -parking: a big parking lot for this plaza.  -service: we came in and the lady sat in the counter told me if I was ok to seat by the bar, we can go for it. I asked her there were not two seats together, I didn't want to have my brunch with different seats with my hubby. She said she could grab a chair which she never did, she didn't even remember she told me what she would do for us. Maybe she's over busy, but it didn't seem very busy that she could handle with the crowds. As soon as we settled ourselves, we had to wave to ask for service, that time was not much people ordered drinks either.  -ox tail fried rice: it tasted like they pre made in the kitchen, as soon as we placed the order, they brought to us in 5 minutes. It's a heavy dish, ox tail meats was stuck together, not evenly. We definitely felt heavy after this plate.  -ox tail soup that is what they are famous for. We have to wait about 30 minutes for them to bring it over, we didn't have any updates with our order. Nothing special for this bowl of soup. The ox tail was hard to chew on, the meat was still stick on the bone. The noodles was very hard, it's tasted like lack of time to cook. The soup base was a bit sour. Flavorless !  -price: the fried rice was $15.99, same as the soup. Very expensive ones.  Good to try and also good to not going bav",

The interior was very modern and somewhat americanized so I honestly had my doubt about authenticity at first. There was no wait for 3 people since we sat by the bar. Our bartender/ server was very friendly. She recommended me to get oxtail pho so I did.  To decorate on the service, my friend had a surprised feminine call of nature and the server rushed to get her some emergency feminine hygiene products very discreetly! ( Mind you, we were sitting at the bar next to a few guys!)   The oxtail pho had very flavorful clear broth as it should be. The noodles weren't impressive; however, the meat was so tender it fell off apart from the bone itself. I was so in love with every spoonful.  My friend got lobster pho. She was so hyped about it since she saw the video online and that was merely the reason why we went in the first place. Sadly, it didn't live up to her expectations and it was just average.  We had a very good experience nonetheless!",

Just order the \"Bone Marrow Soup\"  and you will be WOW'd! I mean, they give you the entire femur (cut in half of course) of the cow in a bowl!  Can't be more WOW'd than anything else!   To describe their menu, I'd say a modernized vietnamese restaurant with lot's of different Pho's, side dishes and specials.  One thing that was pretty interesting was the Ox Tail Loco Moco with gravy made from Pho broth.  I was pretty impressed with the taste! Definitely get that again!    I also go the Ribeye Pho, which I must say, probably the best mean in a bowl of pho I have ever had!    There's lots of goodies to try on the menu, so be daring and try something new!  Although we did have one mishap, and that was with the razor clams.  I think they didn't soak the clams long enough so it still had the gritty sand particles in the meat itself.    Definitely be back to try something new!",

Bone marrow galore....I felt primitive but happy as I gnawed on the bones like Scooby-Doo!  The Chicken Wings were inhaled by the son....so no reviews.  The spring rolls were great once I wrapped them up in the green veggie leaf, along with fresh green herbs...then dipped in the sweet chili sauce....delish.  The braised pork was delicious.....just take an extra Lipitor afterwards.  The 2 dozen oysters were inhaled by the son.....so no reviews.  Finally, the ox tail fried rice was delish....meaty....goes great with the bone soup.  My grade on this place.....good enough for a return engagement!",

The service was was amazing the guy who rang me up also took the bags to my car! Defiantly exceeded my expectations.   When I got home and put the pho soup together it was great. Will defiantly be back for more soon!",

This place had that cool industrial atmosphere while staying clean, modern, and classy. But that's not what we came there for. Everything we ordered was AMAZING! The prices weren't bad either (besides the market priced Lobster Pho, which was BOMB AF and I don't even like pho). Did I mention it was happy-hour when we went? I can't wait to come back so I can order more of those fried Belly Buns!!",

I do not think it is on the menu but on special occasions  it can be ordered.  The only negative thing about the place is that the parking lot is always packed and parking can take a bit of patience.",

Environment and atmosphere was good as well. Will be returning if I'm back in town for some more oysters.",

After you get enough dishes here you notice that most dishes come with a fried egg which I think is nice since they were all cooked well. While the service was good my only complaint was the waitresses would talk things up like the donkey or the pork belly in coconut nice which we found to be just okay.   To Get: Pork belly sliders: favorite dish of the night ox tail fries: Better than Bachi Burger's Garlic noodles with beef ox tail fried rice Whole grilled squid  Okay: Pork belly in coconut juice big bone soup - a hip bone? in pho broth.   Skip: coconut mojito - Way way too much ice, barely anything to drink donkey drink - I prefer a real moscow mule.  But it does come in a cool cup",

We did the spring rolls, garlic & Serrano pepper chicken wings, and Pho ga soup. Everything was awesome. Very modern feel to the space with a lot of TV's. I guess not your typical Asian spot. Food was so good, a lot of beer and cocktail selection. I'm now a big fan of this place. Open til 2 am on a Sunday. Very good!!!!! And Paul at the bar was wonderful.",

    "text": "Very good hip Pho spot near China Town. I've had the oxtail, rib eye, shrimp, and veggie Pho.  Each are excellent in their own right, I prefer the oxtail, they put a ton of meat in plus offer fixins and extra broth on request. Haven't tried the Lobster Pho yet, but this place goes far beyond the gimmick of a $50 bowl of soup. The menu has a variety of tasty options you wouldn't expect to see in a reg Pho shop, like calamari and oxtail fries (both excellent!). The late hours and bar options make this a late night grub necessity. Comfy booths and informed waitstaff round out an altogether solid  experience. Only docked a star for extreme lack of parking, and menu items are around 15% overpriced across the board.  I generally split an app with my Wife and we each get a Pho, after tip total averages $50.",

    "text": "Well what can I say. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I come here a lot. It just has everything in one place. It's far enough from the sometimes overwhelming buzz of the strip, but has a full bar in case you still want to catch a buzz of your own. They have friendly servers, dope atmosphere and cool decor but what really does it is the food. Man I can eat here every day.   They have traditional vietnamese dishes, like pho and BBH. All pretty good, and being that I come from living in LA and OC the land of vietnamese food I can say it's comparable to some of the better spots out there. As far as Vegas goes it's one of my favorite spots for pho. The quality of the meat in particular when you order it raw is better than most out here. And the oxtail pho, man. Oxtail everything is good and they have good oxtail. But what really kills the game is their specials. Where else can you get lobster pho? Nowhere. At least not till they brought it. They always have fresh seafood specials like oysters, crab, and crawfish. I've eaten basically everything. I could keep going on and on but better to let you try it for yourself. Here's a few recommendations tho.  Lobster garlic noodle. Their version of it is so bomb.  Black pepper lobster. I'm a fan of black pepper already but with lobster????? Beef carpaccio. My go to appetizer.  Oxtail fries. Because damn. Oxtail. And fries, but if you don't feel like french fries then try my all time favorite dish here... OXTAIL LOCO MOCO.  Add an extra egg, just because you got it like that.  I get that every time and then I get another main dish too because I'm fat. But happy.",
