Server was nice think her name is Grace, seems to be the only Korean there. I would give 5 stars if the rice was decent but wasn't. It was too dry so fell off from the dish when dipped in the soy sauce. Other than that, very nice. I'd definitely go back.",

They took 20 minutes to give us our water on top of hour wait when they said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We only came here because it was our last resort. We wished we just stayed at Goyemon because the wait was just as long. When it was time to have our order taken, the food took forever and they kept forgetting orders. We had to ask other servers and the only guy that was really attentive to our party was the Filipino dude (wishing we got his name because he was the only one serving us) We ordered three times and never got any of those orders we had to keep asking. The last straw for me was when we ordered edamame and the table next to us who was there long after we arrived got their edamame. Seriously, we waited 30 minutes and I had to tell them to cancel the order because at that point we were beyond upset. My sister ordered a white tuna shortly after and she never got that either. The waitress who originally served us paid us no attention after we complained that we never got any of our food.  We saw the sushi makers just standing around.  The quality of the sushi was very mediocre. The sushi rice overpowered the sushi and was too vinegary. Honestly the worst sushi restaurant we've been too! I don't normally review restaurants but the service was so horrible that I had to. And the fact that our party was a big party the tip was included. They honestly didn't deserve 18% Seriously that's how horrible it was.  I would never reckoned this place to anyone and definitely won't be back. Honestly there are so much other sushi places with better sushi and service.",

However, what really brought my experience down was the lack of customer service this place has. Me and my husband waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our to ask if we wanted to order anything else. The only reason someone actually came to our table was because I had my hand up trying to wave someone down. We had our plates stacked up because we already finished our sushi rolls...and still no one came. No one even came to fill up our waters after seeing our glasses empty. I do not usually complain, but the lack of initiative and urgency the servers had was mediocre. This is unfortunate because I usually loved dining at this location for Doh Sushi, however now that this establishment has replaced it.. I don't think I will be coming back.",

When our waitress was explaining it us it sounded like one order per person per round. After we finished our first round we put in an order for a second round. Our waitress then disappeared for an hour. So we asked the bus boy if he could check on our order. The manager comes to our table and tells us the one order person is for the entirety of the dinner. I asked how we were able to get multiple orders of other items that were one order per person. He then proceeded to give me the run around. I also told him that we had ordered a round of giant clams and it hasn't come out and we've been waiting for 40 mins since our waitress disappeared. He offered to bring them out but I was so over with my experience there that I told him it was okay we we're already full. Definitely will not repeat.",

I haven't been to this Yama Sushi location, but have been to their other location on Maryland and Flamingo plenty of times while going to UNLV. This location is a lot bigger than its other location, but I've heard they expanded.   The service here was great. It seemed like the servers were constantly available as multiple servers floated around taking orders, bringing out the food, and refilling drinks within different table sections. The food was brought to our table not too long after we ordered. There is nothing worse than waiting for the food to come out when you're on your \"eating flow.\"   The All You Can Eat (AYCE) menu seems to be similar from what I can remember at the other location. They also have a separate menu for those doing a la carte, which one of my three friends did. Among the things we ordered some of them were: baked green mussels, takoyaki, different types of nigiri, the Wet Dream Roll (one of my favorites), the Double Dragon Roll, and mochi ice cream. The rice to fish ratio is good to where the rice doesn't take the bulk of the sushi piece.  I wish they had a larger dessert menu. Ice cream and mochi ice cream is what I usually get, but it's nice to have other options just in case I want to try something else. Overall, I'd say it's a good place to go to.",

I love vinegar but, when there is way to much to taste anything else it's not to good.  There was one roll we had in my pictures that the plate is swimming in vinegar.  All the other rolls were pretty good.  It wasn't great it wasn't a bad place it's just not my favorite and it wouldn't be my first choice to go there.  They did have all you can eat and they include desert which was different and really nice to be included in the all you can eat.

We had the garlic edamame, creamy seafood salad, reordered the Hamachi Kama, miso soup, garlic edamame, sake bombs...as far as special rolls the Sun of the beach was good, the man whore.

Food: I like how the chefs did not put on too much rice with the fish. the salmon was pretty good quiality. tasted like the cut came from near the belly. also had ikura, spicy ahi, saba, soft shell crab. lastly the uni portion could've been a little more. i got only half the tongue per nigiri.   Price: for $23 / person AYCE at dinner time, that's actually the best price we have found so far.   Will keep this one on our radar to return.",

I noticed they've added a few new specials & now have takoyaki! O.M.G. I've been craving takoyaki so much & I'm glad I found an AYCE spot that has it.  1 star deducted for the service.

We noticed they all had nicknames so our mission that night was to find out all the different names floating around. All their dishes were on point as far as tastiness and freshness. It kept up to the same level as their primary location if not more, because the staff at this location was a lot more customer service oriented. The only thing I found disappointing was the limit on one type of dessert- you can only get one mochi and one scoop of ice cream rather than two mochi's or two scoops of ice cream. When did that change?  Either than that, everything was FABULOUS!",

I disputed with my card company and was denied. All I wanted was a refund for the damn PLASTIC in our food. We should have choked on it and sued, but I am an honest person.

We watched as 2 parties that were seated after us were able to eat, pay and leave before anyone came over for us to order anything else. We finally gave up and had to ask the hostess to find out who our waiter was and get our check. Even then it took forever to get our check and when we let them know that the wait for any form of service was ridiculous there was no resolution, the explanation was that they were down a waiter, so why seat us if there's not enough staff? Unfortunate experience here because the value is  great for the sushi you get! We won't be coming back or recommending this place any more.",

The kama is good here because you can get both hamachi and salmon kama.  We find the seafood salad creamy style is really good and you get alot for the portion.  Takoyaki balls are the best among the ayce places.  Definitely will be coming back again",

From hostess that don't smile to servers that don't know what there doing taking order wrong very unprofessional. No Napkins. The food itself is very bad seems that chef doesn't care about the food itself. Uni (Sea urchin)suppose to be fresh looking but looks like it's been sitting awhile the salmon skin suppose to be hot yet very cold. The sushi rice very very sticky like u can't even swallow it. Yakitori chicken that is also suppose to be hot very cold. Man I expect more on the servers should be more attentive and focus but seems to be more distracted. Overall I'm not happy with the service and the food itself. Idon't recommend this SuShi Place. Seems like everyone working from Hostess that seats people to servers and the chef overall sucks DONT EVEN THInK ABOUT TRyINg IT SUSHI NOt FReSh. The Hot Food suppose to be hot But Very Cold Not  At all. I'm Very Disappointed and Unsatisfied with this place very disappointed.  I DONT RECOMMEND THIS SUSHI PLACE there are so many to try but not this place Worst Place To Eat Sushi. If I Only Knew I will not go here. My First Time here and also my Last. I will sure to spread this all out to  Las Vegas and other city never ever try this Yama Sushi place Sucks!!!",

As soon as we got to the establishment, it took us 7 minutes to get seated.  7 minutes standing with just another couple behind us.   The food here is alright, it's almost like eating the same thing. My favorite thing to order here is the \"Wet Dream\" and \"Hamachi Kama\". I used to enjoy going here but as I widened my view of sushi, this place is mediocre.  Looking around, one thing that really surprised me was the decoration. I was surprised to see that the overall look of the place certainly did not match the whole- sushi aspect- of this sushi restaurant. There were bookshelves and it almost seemed as if this restaurant was first deemed to become a cafe of some sort. Just a random observation.  However, the food and service were fair (or maybe less than that)  At the every end, they do offer ice cream and mochi. We got our mochi and it was already melted as well as our ice cream.",

The management approached the group but ultimately let their slight slide after they were given a cash bribe.

Heads up, ask for mild if possible.   I also ordered the yama roll which was the best one on the menu in my opinion. The quality of fish isn't that great, but you do get what you pay for.

We tried several appetizer selections (the Green Mussels are our FAV!!), as well as sushi rolls. Hands down the \"Man Whore\" & \"Special Yobo Roll\" are some of the BEST! I could go on and on. We ended with pistachio &  red bean ice cream. I added a mango Mochi ice cream last min. Lester surprised us with this awesome display (see pic). Yama Sushi is definitely worth every penny and will be one of our go-to spots from now on. One more thing...Try the fresh wasabi!!!! (another delicious tip from Lester)",

Every staff member we encountered was friendly and politely answered any question we had. The sushi is absolutely amazing. We ordered 8 rolls between the two of us and loved every roll. My personal favorites were the who's your daddy roll and the man whore roll. Definitely recommend for any visitor or local.",

    "text": "In comparison to the original Yama, Yama Sushi 2 (second branch)definitely has the freshest selection between the two. The only down fall to Yama Sushi 2 is the service which is regrettably slow. It may take up to 30 min to receive a half roll and sometimes your order is forgotten. If you find yourselves waiting close to 25-30 mins to get someone to take or return your check then I would recommended standing up, I've seen this from other (albeit more frustrated) patrons, and gently flag someone down. Still, the food is amazing and the servers try their best to get your order taken and delivered. Management needs to work something out on the lines of customer to server ratio.",

Will definitely be coming here a lot more.",

My family and I usually do the all you can eat menu option. It's waaaaay worth it because we order an appetizer, salad, various rolls, then ice cream. So far during all my visits all the servers are friendly, good customer service. Really busy around dinner time, but what great food place isn't? Definitely recommend the soft shell crab and Dragon roll!",

Me and another Nicole came in and put our name down while we waited for our other friends to show up and find parking.. It took them forever but I understand why!! It's so hard! We got seated and while waiting for them got a drink order in and they finally came in. We got to look at the menu for a while and the the waitress came over and took our order. I wasn't really the hungry so I only got one dragon roll and one of my other friends doesn't really care for sushi so she just got some fried rice. My other two friends got the all you can eat menu which also can include fries, fried rice and some other random things. It cost an extra dollar per roll for soy paper. But I really love it when places are okay when not all the table is all you can eat. I know people probably think they are going to share the food or something but it doesn't always work out that way. We got our food really fast and it was delicious. They have all kinds of unique rolls. One of the ones I remember was the Harry Potter roll. It didn't have much to do with Mr. Potter but it was a unique name. Before finished we ordered mochi and ice cream which was the perfect ending to out meal. I ordered green tea ice cream and strawberry mochi and they only charged me for one. It was really nice of them.",

As my friend is ordering rolls she cuts him off and says \"NO\", then after we order our dessert the same waitress says \"you guys are fat asses haha\" ummm wat. I feel like that's very rude to say to any customer and definitely made us both feel extremely uncomfortable.

Awesome service with 6-7 different waiters and waitresses constantly asking if we wanted to put more food orders in. Tab would have easily exceeded $140 for two of us anywhere else but ended up under $60.   Definitely worth the Uber from the strip or if you find yourself in Chinatown",

We had to order our drinks 3 different times before they brought it out. We ordered our first round of sushi and after that we didn't see the waiter for atkeast 20mins. I kept trying to flag him down so that we can order and he kept ignoring me and continued to help everyone around us. Finally I had to ask another waitress to take our order.   The food was mediocre. The mussels were over cooked and the nigiri did not taste fresh at all. The only good I can say is the price is really good.  once I asked another waitress to assist us we were no longer waiting so long. I am a stickler for customer service.",

A friend had gotten a table first and my bf and I came in a couple minutes later. Waitress asked if we were ready and I said not yet. She said she'd be back but never came back. Had to try and flag someone down after 20minutes. It's like we were invisible in the area they sat us at which is once you enter the restaurant, all the way to the right in the corner. I'm not sure how many times I've waved my hand and the waitress just doesn't pass our table or just doesn't look over.   Food was not that great. Rice had a strong vinegar taste to it, I think they went vinegar happy or something. The amount of rice in a hand roll was just absolutely ridiculous. There was so much rice, the roll became unenjoyable. We literally ate just the section w the fish/veggies along w some rice and there was still a good chunk of it left. The miso soup was sooooo salty.   A few of our orders never made it to the table even though we mentioned it 2-3 times.   All in all, will never come back here. It's lame. Crap service and food.",

We decided to walk in to Yama Sushi not knowing what's behind those glass doors.  We were greeted warmly and seated right away.  This was around 1:30pm and there were still a lot of people eating.  The place was not too noisy and clean.  Not much of a sushi person, we each ordered a bento box.  For less than $9.00, we got miso soup, salad, rice with salmon and Korean bbq.  They were outstanding and fresh.  We also ordered spider roll for appetizer and it was so delish.  Service was excellent.  Waitresses checked on us often and hot tea was poured consistently.  The ambiance was great and we will definitely come back and try AYCE next time.  We will definitely bring out-of-town guests to this place.  Very presentable place.",

We came in on a Saturday at 6:30pm and our party of 4 was seated within 10-15 min which was great! As soon as we sat down our server came and got our orders since we already knew what we wanted. It was funny because the whole time we felt that we had 5+ servers for our table since they all kept stopping by our table making sure we were alright, taking our orders, dropping off the food, refilling our drinks constantly etc! The food came out super quick as well which was a huge plus considering our AYCE sushi experiences have us waiting years for our food to come out!   Overall, the food was just ok. The miso soup was very salty which made it hard for me to eat. Their dessert selection wasn't very appealing for they only had ice cream and mochi. I was really looking forward to some tempura type of dessert but sadly that wasn't on the menu. Rolls that were great were the \"Harry Potter\" and \"No Name\" so I'd give those a try!

Their prices seem reasonable until they add on 15% tip (which they require you to pay or you cannot leave even though the service was nowhere near good enough to warrant even a 5% tip). This would be understandable for a larger party as gratuity but we were a party of 4. Overall, with unfriendly staff and ridiculously slow service, I cannot recommend this restarting to anyone who wants a pleasant dining experience.",

I am still sitting here as I'm writing this yelp review.  Pretty sure they forgot about 3 rolls and edamame.  No one to assist in the front so I had to walk inside to find out what was going on.  The waitress was at her station and when I flagged someone down to ask what is taking so long.  PS I work 2 doors down from you guys so mind you I was being extremely patient.  When the server finally saw me she made the basic \"Oh shit\" face!  Here's the kicker I asked right next to your sushi chef and when I informed them it's going on 30 minutes for a to go order they laughed.  Such poor service!!!!!!  Good luck with the staff you have!",

Not exactly what I usually eat, but it blends in really well with the two rolls and makes it seem lighter than the other ones with seaweed and sauce all over.   You can also order a la carte if you can't do AYCE.   Tip: Get there early on the weekends or go at off hours. There's usually a long wait.",

Right from the start we asked the host if we could sit by the sushi bar she said \"No, but I can offer you a table or booth\" it wasnt even busy and no one was sitting there but we choose a booth  2. We found the waitresses over the top annoying. We were not able to have a nice convo or were even done with some of the dishes when they were already asking what else we wanted in a very stalkerish and pushy way. It's like the were rushing us to leave [no I'm not exaggerating] my girl felt super uncomfortable  3. Personally I can put up with almost anything just as long the food is delicious but it was clear to see the quality of food here wasnt great at all. It was ok at best tbh compared to the other location. Most rolls were dry and seem like pre made or old  4. Overall: we really regret going to that location and will not be going back. The experience was so bad we couldn't believe we had to pay for it. Do yourself a favor and just head to the Flamingo location  Hopefully this helps.",

    "text": "Yama Sushi is an AYCE sushi restaurant, though you can also order a la carte...But by the time you order a couple of dishes from menu you may find out you are better with the AYCE pricing: $20.95 for lunch and $23.95 for dinner. The set price seems to be the way to go here.   Located in the very heart of Spring Mountain, Yama brings in a lot of foot traffic, so it can be quite busy here. For the record, it is not my typical choice for sushi, but it was already chosen by a good friend of mine.  The inside of Yama is very clean, even the air was absent of any fishy odor, which is often the signal for me to leave, without looking back...but on this day, you guessed it, I stayed.  While my guest ordered many different rolls and enjoyed them very much, I ordered Nigiri Sushi. I am not a fan of rolls in general, especially those drizzled with sauce, so I have nothing to say about the rolls here, I simply avoided them. As is often the case, some items are restricted to only one order per person, such as Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Giant Clam, etc.  A typical issue with AYCE Sushi restaurants is that they want you to fill up fast...they put too much rice on their rolls and Nigiri...not at Yama Sushi. Perfect amount for each bite!!   The service was attentive and friendly. They don't rush you, but they are not slow to take your order either.  So, if you need a spot for AYCE and want the option of rolls, nigiri, and sashimi, this might not be a bad option for you.  - 2017 Review #62 -",

She doesn't know how to smile, so it already left a bad impression of how service was going to be.  She was not happy to be there taking orders or serving food.

Yum!  Just one more.  Yum!  The salmon was buttery.  The shrimp tempura was perfect.  The eel/unagi was yummy.  Only $20!  OMG!  I'm moving to Vegas just so I can eat here every week. (not really).

So that is the 1st plus. 2nd you can order what you want off their menu where as other places you have to pick from what is already made. 3rd drive is fast and I mean fast. The wait was only 5 mins to sit. We sat the waitress was their with in a min. Asked us about drinks and took out order. Maybe 2 mins later our drinks came and maybe another 2 mins the sushi showed up. As soon as the plate it empty someone is asking if you want more and takes the order. And a few minutes last it shows up. They work great as a team there so you don't have to wait for your original waiter. Anyone walking by and sees the empty plate will take it and ask if you want more. Best sushi place I have ever been too. And it all tastes so fresh. My wife made the comment that she could taste how fresh her cucumber was. I was impressed by the slices a fish they use not low quality it almost like it melts in your mouth. We are only here 4 days but will be back before we leave.",

The sushi was good. The nigiri tasted nice and fresh. The baked rolls were delicious and warm. The rolls with salmon were particularly my favorite. I did the AYCE and it was very much worth the price. It was very fulfilling with the good variety of sushi. For desert, I was able to choose a scoop of ice cream, and one mochi ice cream, among other deserts. All were cold and refreshing. The plum wine ice cream was very good and tasted similar to cotton candy. The mochi was great too. The waiters were kind and almost always ready to take empty dishes away. On this particular day, however, the restaurant was not busy very much. Overall, a very nice and delicious dining experience.",

It was sooooo tasty, sweet and buttery. Best uni I've ever had!! I tried uni over Oyshi and it was not good. I'll be coming back tomorrow with my friend for that uni! I would've given them 5 stars but the nigiri they made was a little sloppy, broken fishes, but it came out really fast though. I ordered some unagi and it has too much fat, the cut was uneven also.

He quickly apologized for the delay and said \"I'm not sure what they are doing?\"   This was all ok, even the fact that nothing we came for was available.  It was once the sushi came we started to lose our appetite.  The eel sauce had a very strong burnt burnt flavor.  They do have a lot of rolls to chose from, so maybe I picked the wrong rolls. I just don't know if I'll be back now that I know Doh is gone. Sorry Yama",

So when we found out another location was opening we were super excited about it and couldn't wait to try. When we arrived to the Plaza it is located in, I was extremely disappointed in the availability for parking. There was absolutely no parking whatsoever. I know it's China Town and it usually always busy but dang.  Once we entered I was pleased to find that waiting area was so spacious compared to the original location. The original has a bench inside that seats maybe 5 people and some benches outside. Anyways very pleased with the waiting area. As I walked in I was also pleased to find how big and spacious the entire restaurant was. I'm used to being elbow to elbow. Here however was very roomy. I was also so so happy to see booths.  The waiters were very nice and prompt as always. And the food was great. Which I was hoping it would be. And so it was. I just wish that they had like a sushi bar in the middle of the room since they have room to do that.  This location overall is pretty great but again the parking sucks balls! I'd come back with friends. But maybe carpool.",

The service has definitely gotten better since the old location, maybe due to more staff? Our server, Maria always checked up on us and notice the small things (taking our plates, refills, ordering more food, etc.,) She was on top of things, I loved that.   The food came out pretty fast. The sushi proportion is perfect, 75% sushi and 25% rice that's how it should be done. The salmon felt like butter, it melts in your mouth so perfectly. I recommend getting the yellowtail Kama, it comes with lemon and ponzu sauce it's so good (although it's limited to 1 per person), their Amaebi (sweet shrimp) is bomb too, you get the option of rather or not you want the shrimp's head which is battered and deep fried.

I let the waitress know that I'm allergic to seafood EXCEPT shellfish and if she could recommend me a dish that was applicable for me to eat. She recommended a crab roll so I ordered it and when it came to our table it had raw fish on top. But hey, it did have crab meat inside, so....  I felt a bit uncomfortable since now I needed to be careful about what I order and can't trust the waitress. Other than that, after spending about 10 minutes looking at the lengthy menu, I order the correct items and were brought to me very fresh and savory.   Would I give this place another shot? Absolutely. The waitress may have just been overwhelmed. But I will definetly be looking at the yelp reviews before going in to have a better idea of what their most popular savory dishes are.",

    "text": "Some what similar menu, different (bigger) location.  For starters, why wasn't a new Yelp page made for the new location? DOH wasn't that great but why confuse people and not differentiate the two? Have Yama really earn their reviews and stars instead of reflecting off of DOH or mixing the two! The place still felt like DOH, but with Yama menu, I'm sure they're still working on it.  The waiters/waitresses were attentive and friendly but I didn't like how it seemed like they were yelling every time someone walked in. Maybe tone it down to a 5, since everyone working has to greet anyways, lol.  Now about the food.. My all time favorite (and would probably crave here and there) is the \"Wet Dream\" roll! Baked, cream cheesy, shrimpy goodness! Then maybe \"No Name\", then \"Sun of the Beach\".  Their nigiris looked good, not too much rice and fish looked fresh, but I am more of a roll type of person! They also have a good amount of appetizers or sides to choose from.  I haven't been to Yama sushi in years, but after dining here recently I'm not too crazy about it.. I just honestly wasn't impressed.  \\_()_/ ",

They have all you can eat sushi and I love that they have small icons next to the favorite ones the spicy ones, they also translate it well so you know what you will be ordering. I like that they make you aware to order only what you will eat or you will pay extra. The portions are small so you get to try it out and if you want more you order more instead of wasting it. They do offer bigger portions. But it's best to order a variety with smaller portions so you don't . waste food. They also let you pick desserts like green tea mochi or ice cream. The mochis are really yummy. Everything is fresh and tasty. It has a good atmosphere. And yes it's busy. And yes the parking lot deal is a mess but I don't mind, it's definitely worth it. The service is good. The food is great. And the price is fair for the quality.",

    "text": "Looking for DOH in Spring Mountain, drove back & forth looking for it, confused to not find it on yelp/maps anymore... Come to find out it was bought out by YAMA 3 weeks ago! Well, no wonder we couldn't find it. -____- But we came for sushi and we were already there, so we decided to try it out. Same decor & layout as Doh previously had it, just different menu...  We ordered: ROLLS: - No name roll x 2 - Wet dream  - Turning Japanese  - Yama crunch  - Eel nigiri x3 - Salmon nigiri x2 APPETIZERS: - Baked green mussels x2 (4 pieces each order) - Soft shell crab x2 - Dynamite - Miso soup - Edamame  DESSERT: - Green tea mochi - Strawberry mochi   Wasn't too impressed with the menu selection, but did like that each specialty roll on the menu had a little picture so you had an idea of what you are getting. Also, dinner is also only $23.95 (most AYCE sushi places are around $27)! Service was very attentive, but we did have 3 different people checking up on us -- so we often had to say, \"Oh, we already told the other server.\" Made it a tad confusing at times. But overall, a decent dining experience... just nothing I would go out of my way for.  PRO TIP: Order half rolls so you can try different ones out. That way you get 4 pieces versus 8 if you end up not liking it. And if you do like it, you can always order more!",

At one point a girl came looking for a table that had ordered Unagi. I told her it wasn't us, because we haven't ordered yet as no one has come since we sat. Instead of apologizing for poor service or showing any concern she just slowly said \"ookay\" rolls her eyes and walks away looking for the table. From where we sat I could clearly see 2 other tables looking around waiting to be helped. One guy in the booth waved to the hostess as she walked by, instead she helped the busser adjust and prepare another table for guest!? How? If you can't serve the people you have now why would you seat more? The guy in the booth. Behind us continued to be ignored. We got up and walked out, and the hostess \"thanked us\" for coming.   This was our first time here. Whatever the reason for poor service, it's a shame they showed lack of concern for the people who fund their business.",

Took long for sushi to come out and got appetizers late, but they did give us sushi we didnt order and said it was ok if we didnt finish it. It is cheaper than most places at $20.95 for AYCE lunch and menu does have a lot to choose from. They forgot some of our orders. Idk how when it was not that busy during friday at 1pm. Also I dont know what happened, but this place used to be called Do'h. Its now called Yama which lm assuming is like the one near UNLV, but nowhere as good. Although employees were super nice, I recommend taking a pass at this place. Theres lots of other sushi places nearby in chinatown with much fresher fish.",

Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling the best so I just ordered a few rolls. The spicy tuna and philly rolls did not disappoint. I was called \"basic\" for ordering those. Oh well, I probably am!  Others at our table did get the AYCE. There is a 2 hour time limit. You pay for what you do not eat. You cannot just eat the goodies and leave the rice (like for real someone did that) it's 23.95$ which I personally think is a deal. The servers were nice and attentive, the place was packed. Don't be scared about the fact it's in a strip mall! Looks can be deceiving",

The rolls are great, the servers are attentive and it seems like the rolls are instantly ready as soon as you order them.  This place can get very busy at times, but it is very much worth the wait.  The No Name Roll was among my favorites.  The Ellen Roll was great as well.  So many servers stopped by to refresh beverages and to take orders. It is a great experience any time I'm here.    I will definitely be back.  If you're on the West Side of town, you should definitely try this place some day.  If you do, you'll be back as well!",

They had a full house with a line out the door and for them to be consistent and fast was amazing considering how packed the place was! Also everything we ordered was so delicious!

Our last visit at the Flamingo location was super unpleasant and the quality of the food was horrible. Seems like this location still has great sushi chefs that care about their work. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Parking can be a pain since it's located at one of the busiest strip malls in China Town but I think it's worth it. I'd recommend this place to anyone craving sushi in the area.",

Next we moved onto the rolls No Name, Happy Ending, Wet Dream, Sun of the beach, and Baby one more time all excellent. I like Salmon so the Happy ending is my favorite. Also most of the rolls you can order as half rolls so you can just try them out. Finished with Nigiri we got Salmon, Eel, Shrimp, Yellow tail and Red Snapper. Service was good for how busy they were.  This place is my go to for AYCE Sushi in Vegas and dinner price was 26$ each we had waters to drink.",

    "text": "Like with any AYCE sushi place, you get your money's worth here just bc of all the options available. But I judge a sushi place based on their nigiri, and I'm sad to say I was disappointed here. The sashimi pieces were rather dry and the rice was lacking in flavor, like not enough rice vinegar. Their menu for nigiri was rather small, not as much variety that I'm used to, and missing some standards in my opinion. But they have a large variety of cooked rolls. The rolls, however, were really delicious and kind of what saved this place for me, 3 stars instead of 2. Their baked and deep fried rolls all sound amazing on the menu, and the flavor doesn't disappoint. But again, if I don't like the nigiri, I feel like I wasted my time. I don't really eat rolls at all, but I felt the need to try them here to really get the value for what I paid ($23.90 AYCE dinner).   The service was great, orders were taken and delivered promptly. All of the servers were really nice and attentive, and I thought it was cute how all their name tags are cartoon characters.   If you like COOKED \"sushi,\" then definitely give this place a try. But if you're like me and prefer the nigiri and real raw stuff, you'd do better to look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Came here for a family lunch and it was pretty good.  It seems like they have a bunch of old menus mixed with new ones.  So if you see fried rice and chicken karaage then you have a newer menu.   We arrived shortly after opening at noon so there were only a couple of tables occupied.  We ordered some hot appetizers but it took them a really long time to get it out to us.  It took them 15 mins to bring out our udon noodle bowls and hamachi kamas.  The sushi rolls came out way faster.    Ok so the appetizers we ordered were: Hamachi Kama Baked mussels Udon noodles both chicken and the tempura  Shrimp tempura Bbq ribs Chicken karaage Chicken nuggets Beef fried rice Seafood boat  The Kama was good, nice and meaty with a nice dipping sauce.  The tempera was perfect, nice and crispy with not too heavy of a batter.  The karaage was over breaded, I think they used flour instead of rice flour for the breading.  It wasn't very tasty.  The nuggets were gross, never ordering that again.  The kids didn't even want to eat it.  The bbq ribs looked real tender and soft but it was really tough to eat, it was really rubbery and chewy.  Mussels were good  and udon was on point.  The seafood boat is a mix of raw fish (poke) with some tempura pieces.    So the cool thing about this place is that they actually let you order their special items even for lunch so we ordered uni, sweet shrimp and the giant clam.  Regular items were salmon and yellowtail with a double dragon roll.  The sweet shrimp came with fried heads.  The doubly dragon roll was shrimp tempura with eel and avocado on top, pretty tasty.    Dessert is ice cream (limited to 2 per person) or mocha ice cream (limited 1 per person).  Kids 3-6 are half off, 7 and above is full price.",

    "text": "There was a long wait. According to other reviews, that's apparently always True.  As an appetizer, I paid $4 for a couple of egg rolls that were about four inches long and the diameter of a dime. Come on now, really. The miso soup and the cucumber salad appetizers were about $1.50 each, I observed those portions were much better matched to the price.  The AYCE deal at Yama Sushi was a few bucks cheaper than Sushi Kaya about 14 mile up the street, but Sushi Kaya was somewhat better quality, and the service was a wee bit more attentive.   Pho Kim Long is just a few doors away in the same strip mall as Yama Sushi. No ACYE sushi at Pho Kim Long, of course, but the product is much higher quality, a nice meal, with generous portions, and you'll get out easily for the same price.  I'd take either of those places again before Yama Sushi. But Pho Kim Long is the best choice of the three, by far.  Guess I'm just not really down for these pig-out AYCE sushi food-as-fuel packed-mad-house joints.",

    "text": "This has to be my favorite AYCE sushi in Vegas. As always though, expect a little bit of wait if you're going on weekend night since it does get busy, but it's not much of a wait since the venue is pretty large. I'd recommend to try the No Name roll and the Who's Your Daddy. Very good choice but also everything else; I havent found a rolled that's not worth ordering. For the nigiri, the rice to fish ratio is pretty well proportioned and the fish taste fresh. Their Soju and Sake are also good company with the rolls. Between two people, for AYCE and a bottle of Sake, our bill was around $50, which was definitely worth it in my opinion. Definitely coming back again and again.",

    "text": "I thought I found my new sushi spot but I was wrong. I brought my boyfriend here for the first time on a Saturday night. Thankfully we beat the dinner rush because the dining room was half full. However, we waited for awhile and servers were walking by without a glance. I don't know if they have a scheduled host or it's just servers that sit the customers.  I don't know if their manager was off duty or the staff is normally not supervised. I've worked in the restaurant business before and servers were just all over the place. There was no organization what so ever. You can tell who is hardworking and trying to tend to their tables, and you can tell on who just doesn't want to work by standing at the micro...not doing a single thing. We were asked for our drink order 3 times but when it came to ordering more rolls, it was hard to flag a server down. Sushi came out fast, but whenever a server presented the plates to us, they seem confused or unsure if this was what we ordered. They brought us the wrong order twice and gave us full rolls instead of the half rolls we ordered. Sad to say, I will not be coming back nor would I suggest Yama to others.",

No absolute odor on their fish. Yamasushi is so generous with the fish amounts!  We've been here way too many times and never get disappointed . Every time people visit us from out of state we always bring them here and blown away by how amazing everything tasted.  The prices here are unbelievable and the quality is out of this world! I love everything here my absolute favorites are hamachi kama, yama crunch, double dragon, mackerel , unagi, salmon skin roll to name a few. Try the agedashi tofu, takoyaki, udon soup and if you're adventurous try Uni.Honestly can't go wrong with anything you try here. It makes me hungry writing this lol Service here is always fast and courteous. They have cute server nicknames. Our favorite server is Maleficent. She always has a nice smile on her face . She's awesome! I highly recommend this place. Seriously, give them all your money! Lol",

Didn't really taste a lot of the fish since it was masked in a ton of sauce.   Overall restaurant seems to cater to those who want the ayce experience and haven't had decent sushi before... if you catch my drift............",

    "text": "My favorite AYCE sushi spot has opened a second location on the west side in China Town! I love the spacious, open restaurant. The other Yama location is soo packed that I always feel claustrophobic there. This location is bright, airy, and modern. I really enjoyed that aspect. The menu is the exact same and I even recognized some of the same sushi chef's from the other store. However, a lot of the food was different to me. The ponzu sauce on the seafood salad, for example, tasted different. Not as citrus-y. The rolls appeared to be cut smaller as well. For this reason, we ordered 2x the amount of rolls than we normally would. Pricing for lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $23.95 which is extremely reasonable!   I love that it's AYCE and you can get anything on the menu. First time there? I gotchu. Start with a seafood salad either mild or hot if you like spice. Then if you're into apps, the sesame chicken is good, as well as the tempura shrimp.  Then, bring on the rolls. My favorites are:  Happy Rainbow Sun Of The Beach Wet Dream No Name Ellen Roll Harry Potter  Many of these rolls are very saucy which is what I like. If you don't like saucy rolls, move on! My dining partner who had never eaten sushi before LOVED this place and cannot wait to go back. And we will be back.",

Make sure you order the items selected as \"one per person\", those are special items and they are worth to order! #vegas #sushi  Ps.: Chinatown location looks fancier than the other but both service and food are the same, if you are in a business or romantic occasion, go to Chinatown.",

I work in the restaurant business and understand that when it gets busy things can get hectic, but as a server its part of your job to hold it together in front of the guests.  We then asked a server with a name tag \"Bruce Lee\" to change servers. \"Bruce Lee\" asked why and we explained then told us to go to him if we needed anything. The service started getting better since we didnt have to deal with \"im a killer\". Food came and it was GREAT!! Amazing sushi!

    "text": "This place is so terrible! I never recommend anyone to eat here. It isn't worth it. I stopped there one Saturday, and the host seated two of us. Shortly after we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order. Another 10 for our food order. It was terrible. We had a new server every time someone came by our table. They were rude and unhelpful. When our rolls arrive the servers stopped coming to our table. Eventually we had to wave the hostess down. She was helpful. The rolls weren't even all that good either. The California roll tasted really fishy. More fishy than usual. Like they used cheap imitation crab. I wanted more rolls but no one else came by and we decided to leave. Here's the funny part. THEY LOCK YOU IN! I think in fear of people eating and running (the all you can eat sushi). We had to go up to the hostess and ask for our ticket. She got it and I paid for it. My friend attempted to go outside while I paid and the door wouldn't budge. He turned and said the doors locked. He noticed The hostess slyly push a button under her stand and the doors unlocked. What the f*** kind of sh** is that?!! We ate there for lunch. I told her the service was awful and I plan never to return. She was snooty after that. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE GO HERE! Save your time and money! Go somewhere else!",

    "text": "Very disappointed. Every single roll, and every single nigiri we ordered was sitting on a puddle of 'ponzu.' (Ponzu is in quotations because it tsted like straight malt vinegar) even if it didn't specify that it would be there, it was. This resulted in soy paper becoming soggy and unwrap from the rolls. It causes the rice, which was rather chewy, to crumble upon pick-up and impossible to stay together. It all just fell apart. All the rolls ended up tasting the  same. No matter what different ingredients, they all just tasted like vinegar. Maybe the fish was smelly, and they did this to disguise it? Tempura was lukewarm and chewy/old tasting. Green mussels were the equivalent of chewing an ear. Firecracker had dried out overcooked spicy tuna inside that they tried to hide with a quart of mayo. Green tea ice cream tasted like an old lady's perfume. We're not surprised the place was dead. Service was very friendly and fast, so there's that, but we won't be returning.",

The tend to add more rice on the second time around when you order. I love their salmon belly but sometimes they are out. It's not bad for the price of ayce. I would suggest they should be consistent with the rice instead of adding way too much. It should be proportionate.",

Especially since it's cold outside and we didn't want to be sitting by the door waiting! The rolls were great! There were a few favorites we had - Sun on the beach, wet dream, and no name roll. I love how you can order half rolls!   The only complaints I had about the restaurant - I asked the guy dropping off our drinks what the price for AYCE was and he said he didn't know and he'd find out. I feel like that is pretty basic information for a sushi restaurant. Before someone got back to us we had already found the price ourself on the menu. I ordered some nigiri, and I was wondering why it took so long. Then I got excited because I saw it finally coming and they put it down at another table that got seated after me. Then I realized, they forgot my order. When I reordered it wasn't too long before they brought my order over. The dessert menu is tiny. They only have 6 things. 3 different flavors of mochi, and 3 different flavors of ice cream. My friends didn't like the texture of the green tea ice cream. I enjoyed the strawberry mochi and the pistachio ice cream. The parking wasn't the greatest. I was able to find a spot, but they weren't extremely busy. I could see it being a problem on busy nights.   When it's your birthday, which it was for the table next to us, they play the birthday song through loud speakers throughout the entire restaurant. This is good for a sushi restaurant. Usually they don't make a big deal about birthdays. I'm not sure if it was a trick candle, or if the lady was just older, but it took her about 6 tries to blow out the candle they gave her. So be ready!   All in all the food was good quality, and I love how you can order half rolls! The garlic tuna and salmon were good! Also, it is the next morning so it's safe to say, no food poisoning. It's good to be able to trust a sushi restaurant! I'd go again for that sun on the beach roll!",

There was $40 in cash tip on the table when they took our cards and cash, but then took $16 by force without our consent so they lost that $40. No company should FORCE a tip. If you weren't gonna take that cash from our cash paying friends, it is unacceptable to steal it from card users. Will never use card here again, and other card users beware. However, if you're paying with cash, this place is very good. I give their food and service a 5.",

We enjoyed the specialty rolls, bbq ribs (kalbi), unagi sushi, saba sushi, soft shell crab, amaebi, mochi ice cream, and everything we ate!  Make sure you eat all your sushi including the rice as they will charge you extra if you don't finish it!  My wife and all ate about $110 plus if we were to order off the menu at regular price.

Unorganized which is understandable. I love that they kept the bookshelfs, very homey feeling...  We went for my birthday dinner around 7pm, party of...5 adults and my 5 y.o son.   The place looked pretty empty so We were seated immediately.  Servers were nice and attentive for the most part.  When we eat sushi we always do AYCE, so we ordered quite a bit.  Rolls started coming in pretty quick.  They were Good, but nothing to rant about...I was mostly excited to try the Baked Mussels (these are one of my favorite dishes when i go out to eat sushi/seafood)... And I must say when they arrived, they looked good.  But after tasting them , I was sadly let down, the excessive amount of sirracha on top was just unnecessary.. To put it simply, i didn't like it.    I'm also going to say, beware of their spice meter, (little chili emojis in their menu) we ordered a roll that had a level one spice and it literally was like fire in our mouths.  While another roll that was level three spice tasted like nothing.    All in all, would come here again, only Because it's decent sushi.  But it's no longer my favorite sushi spot....",

There was 4 of us in our party and we were seated immediately. We chose a booth.   At this moment, the host asked for our drinks which was cool because we were really thirsty from this hot afternoon. I truly liked how clean their table was and the menu was easy to read with a wide variety of items to choose from. We all chose to eat all you can eat.   The server introduced herself and asked us if we were ready to order. Of course we were and ordered a lot of different sashimi and special rolls. All came out surprisingly fast for being a tad busy and seeing only 2 chefs at the bar.   All the sushi was beautifully presented and the quality and taste was great! Loved how the dessert section you get to choose 2 scoops of ice cream and 1 mochi which was a plus!  Love this sushi place and this really hit the spot! Prices was cheap too compared to other competitors.",

Initially we ordered several things from the AYCE menu and it took them a good 25-30 mins to even check on us again to order more food. However I have to say the Seafood Salad was really good. We loved the original location on Flamingo but not sure if I will go back to this location.",

    "text": "Okay, this place isn't the greatest AYCE sushi.  Yama Sushi isn't my first choice for AYCE sushi, but we came here for sushi since a friend of mine wanted to come here for her birthday. Also, since it is a central location from our friends in the Southwest, Northwest, and Henderson. I've come here a couple of times before. It has definitely been a minute since I last visited, and I didn't remember why. Now, I definitely remember. Frankly, their food just isn't good.   We were sat pretty quickly for a party of 5. It took a couple of minutes before our order was taken after we were sat and given waters. On top of that, it took a while before we got our appetizers that our sushi rolls came before our appetizers. I ordered garlic edamame and gyoza to start with and the garlic edamame was gross. The garlic was like soggy and the edamame seemed like it was drenched in oil. The fried Gyoza came out okay on the other hand. Not super flavorful, but just OK.   When I order from AYCE, I get a caterpillar roll and dragon roll right off the bat. So, their supposedly \"eel sauce\" is gross. Instead of that nice, slightly sweet, slightly salty, smooth, translucent, light brown color, I'm used to seeing drizzled over my sushi rolls, the \"eel sauce\" at Yama Sushi was dark AF, tasted super salty and slightly burned. It just ruined the roll. We also tried some of their specialty rolls, and it just was no bueno.  I also usually order soft-shell crab rolls, which they didn't have much to choose from. Their crab rolls were super plain in flavor. I figured I would try the \"Palm Job\", and it didn't satisfy my craving for that crunch that you get from eating a soft-shell crab.  I think the only good thing here was the sweet shrimp since it came with a fried shrimp head and their green muscles not being burnt. Also, the BOGO sake, which ended up to be ordered wrong due to miscommunication. We wanted two of the bottles of sake and we ended up getting four.   Overall, my sushi craving has not been satisfied. I definitely remember why I don't come to Yama Sushi.",

The sushi was well made and very delicious. We tried various types with some interesting names. All arrived at the right time. I highly recommend this place.",

However the food wasn't as great as the original spot. Although the service is good and frequent but that was at first. We didn't get three items that we ordered and when we asked, we were told it was being made. We didn't mind waiting because we had other items coming. By the end of our meal, the servers stopped coming by as frequent as in the beginning. Another thing, there were a lot of people waiting to be seated as if the restaurant was full. However there were a lot of tables available for people to be seated. Maybe the waiting is a tactic? Highlights: spacious, open late, good service",

    "text": "We're creatures of habit, especially when it comes to sushi and dining out. Once we find a good sushi spot, we seldom stray from it, if at all. But today, wifey and I decided we're missing out if we don't venture outside of our usual AYCE Sushi place so we decided to go play \"Yelp Roulette\" and select the first restaurant we scroll to--and Yama Sushi it is! The restaurant is situated in the heart of Chinatown on Spring Mt. with a nice clean and open ambience looking ready to accommodate large groups. We came in early before the rush crowd and was seated fairly quickly. The wait staff is swift to get our drinks and orders and it came in just as fast. So why only 3-stars? Well, our issue is the sushi itself--the food is quite sub-par, not that bad in taste or quality but nothing exceptional either. Also there's something off about the sushi rice, and as a sushi master once quipped, sushi is all about the rice, the fish is just condiment. Which leads us to the fish, the quality is again a bit below than what we're used to, especially the scrap-looking (and tasting) hamachi (yellow tail), low-grade salmon and the (brownish) uni. We're not expecting Nobu level sushi-grade fish for the moderate entrance fee we're paying, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the proteins being used isn't fresh or good enough quality especially when comparing them to other places we've been to that charge for the same price yet offers better quality food. Yama Sushi does have a lot of patrons flocking in, we won't be one of them and I guess it's back to our tried and True usual sushi place.",

    "text": "Yama Sushi has expanded from their original location on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway and decided to give their Chinatown location a try.  \"Nothing beats the original\" holds so True.  There is nothing really wrong about this location, just not as good as the original.  Here are a few examples:  The uni was a little skimpy, didn't completely cover the rice.  Rice for the sushi was a little more and pieces of fish not as generous.  The hamachi kama didn't have the nice crispy exterior and not as moist inside.  For the positives: only 5 - 10 minutes from the Strip, a better neighborhood than the Maryland Parkway area (don't want to offend anyone here, if you are familiar with East Las Vegas, you know what I'm talking about), the service is still very good, and it's not as crowded with immediate seating.  You can't beat the price, it's still a few bucks less than comparable sushi AYCE restaurants.",

I enjoy their efficiency and accuracy when it comes to customer service and food. I could NOT believe how fast they were in delivering the food to our table. I love how the AYCE includes apps, and desserts! Love their offerings of short ribs, katsu, karaage, teriyaki, seafood salad, poke, etc. the list goes on!  My favorite sushi options are always something with unagi.  The MOST popular one is the \"no name\" which is #24. I see why everyone gets it. it is sooo flavorful and captures unagi with salmon and shrimp tempura. Mmmm. I also like their #34 Spicy Sexy Roll for their take on spicy sushi, and really, almost anything here is good. I just don't care for deep friend rolls.  Some rolls were smaller and not as detailed, like the philly roll and the unagi. I thought it still tasted fresh, not like a sushiland. But I think b/c they strive to be quick, the details get lost. Otherwise, pretty cheap for AYCE ~23.95 and for the most part, I think their sushi and appetizer offerings are really worth it! Now i'm getting hungry!",

The sushi rolls are standard,  most have too much sauce doused all over.  There was a decent amount of specialty rolls to choose  from, so I stuck to ones with less sauce.    To end on a good note,  the soft shell crab, shrimp tempura and hamachi kama is good.  The fact that you can order half rolls is a great way to eat at a sushi buffet.",

Every person who walks by will take your order and grab you anything you need.   Get the all you can eat- it's so cheap and worth it. Get soup, rolls, sashimi, dessert etc!   The no name roll is the absolute most delicious thing in the world- trust me!!",

I wouldn't never have stopped here, let alone eat here, if it wasn't recommended by work friends.   They take much longer than they tell you when you do pickups and only accept calls at EXACTLY 12noon - not a minute, not a second earlier.",

They're  #7 and #26 on the specialty roll menu. They were the tastiest and most memorable for my boyfriend and I. We also love our yellow tail tuna nigiri sushi. Nice and simple with some soy sauce and wasabi. Good Hamachi is what makes us keep coming back for more.  The service was very fast and very attentive. They went out of their way to make good menu recommendations and never let our drinks go dry. Definitely one of the better sushi places we've tried since moving to Las Vegas. Can't beat the price for AYCE also.",

    "text": "They used to be named, \"Doh Sushi & Tapas\" but renamed to Yama Sushi. This restaurant is the \"cousin\" I would say to Tofu Hut KBBQ and Doh KBBQ. I occasionally go to this sushi spot and had been here since they have opened a few years ago, and I they have improved. Parking is pretty difficult to find, especially on weekends but the wait time at this place is short. Whenever I get there it is empty or I get there before the rush starts.   They have a modern touch to their environment and I really like the ambiance. Since I have been there I have not experienced a stable server, which is fine because every server around (although they are assigned) are easily accessible if we needed a refill on a drink or to place another order. Portioning is a lot to me and they do not offer half sized rolls upon me asking so beware of that. I really love their garlic tuna out of everything else on the menu and when it comes to dessert their ice-cream banana tempura is delicious. The banana tempura is a part of the AYCE (TYJ!!!) usually some places only limit you one mochi per person but they do not do that with the tempura. Dinner price is about $26 per person for AYCE but I am not sure about lunch price because I have never experienced lunch here.   ***LAST CALL is 12:30/1am*** I remember coming to this place around that time and they said they could not serve me because they closed at 2:30am, and that was not enough time for their sushi chef's to bring out our orders in time. Last call is pretty earlier than most places because I have been to another sushi spot that closes at 2am and still accepted people at 1:30/1:45am.",

However; sitting at the sushi bar, we frequently found ourselves with empty plates, looking longingly at the sushi chefs - trying to get some attention. We had to actively flag down waitstaff to get refills on water or tea.  It wasn't a particularly crowded or busy evening. When someone is three feet away, and repeated \"Excuse me's\" are not acknowledged... Well, we definitely felt ignored.  The food... eh.... on the average side of average. The nigiri pieces were decent sized, but the rice would not hold together, and was fairly bland. The rolls are exactly what you expect at this kind of place - funny names, but no more than serviceable as food.   I've had much better experiences at the East Side Yama, even though it is loud and tightly packed.",

As I was going through the menu, I noticed that there are some new rolls on there. Like Trust Me Baby, Fish and Chips and You the Man Too! They are new, right? I must haven't been paying attention to the original location's menu. Ha  Service is the same, still attentive and caring. But what knocks it down from a 4* to a 3*? It no longer has that home-y feel. The mom and pop store ambiance. It's commercialized or feels like a franchise.   I'd def come back but to the original location on Flamingo and Maryland Pkwy.",

    "text": "This is my third visit to this Yama Sushi location. I keep saying \" well, let's give it one more try!\" Unfortunately, it gets worse and worse every time we come here.  It's a very busy location, being that it's in a very busy plaza in spring mountain. We waited 40 minutes to be seated (which should've been a giveaway that we should probably leave, but I'm not blaming the restaurant for the wait), and were pretty ignored throughout our stay. I had to physically get up and ask a server to order more food to get attention.   The sushi is nothing special. It's not particularly fresh so I'm not sure what the raving reviews are about. On one of the orders of salmon nigiri that I got, there was a brown spot at the end. The special rolls were fine as they were soaked in various sauces to cover the taste of the extremely bland fish. When they served us the tempura udon, they did not separate the soup and the tempura and by the time we were done eating it all the tempura batter had fallen off and into the soup and made a huge disgusting mess.   After a certain point and we just gave up. We didn't even want the dessert so we waited for a server to give us the check, which AGAIN, nobody came to our table despite making direct eye contact with them. I approached the server and asked to pay. I gave her my card and she told me to sit down while she rang it up and was promptly gone for 10 more minutes.   It was a blessing to leave. I'm not the kind of person who will eat at a restaurant and then demand my money back so I'll at least IMPLORE everyone who goes here: there are better sushi places around! Please go there and not risk food poisoning like I'd gotten that night.  To top it all off: C grade high on the wall we didn't see until we were walking out. Lovely.",

I LOVE THIS PLACE and wish there was one back home so I could come more often. Definitely will visit again when I come back to Vegas.   Ayce sushi was $20.95 for lunch - a great deal imo. There is an incredible selection of appetizers, nigiri, rolls, hand rolls, etc. It's amazing!! My friends and I ate so much (each totaling about ~$60 worth of food) and left incredibly satisfied. The sushi itself was very yummy, especially the salmon nigiri!! The fish to rice ratio was on point! Also, get the mochi ice cream! Highly recommended in all of these yelp reviews and pretty good!",

The look of the place is really cute and comfy with nice little booths. There are LED lights behind the sushi bar that change colors which is nice to look at. The chefs work their asses off and get all the orders out quickly with precision. I personally am a nigiri person and I always get the salmon because it is super FRESH. Also if you happen to be waiting for a table I recommend asking for MIMI'S section she has been helpful and incredible each time I come and she always has my order almost memorized.",

    "text": "Overall this place is pretty good for AYCE sushi:  Here's what i mean  1 - Tons of choices and selection - Self explanatory. But this place has more so than a lot of other AYCE places.  2 - They are really good about not loading up on fillers - example, The first thing I noticed was the Sushi isn't loaded with rice.  The batter on the tempura wasn't loaded with flour.  The ratio of Protein to fillers is darn good.  If you go to most AYCE places, they LOAD on fillers.  I am impressed by the fact YAMA does not.  We ordered at least 6 rolls, and finished them all.  Good luck with that at any kind of other sushi place.    That alone is worth the 5, says this place doesn't try to skimp or try to fill you up with rice, just because it's AYCE.  3 - The speed - There's something to be said about this system.  We ordered at least 15 different items, and NOT one was missed or in error.  And almost all our orders came out within 5 minutes of ordering. In fact, my SO forgot some stuff she ordered!  The downside to this is that we had to eat super FAST and stuff food down, just to keep up with the food that was coming to make room at the table.  4 - The quality was decent -  I don't expect super super quality or expensive ingredients at an AYCE place.  I think that's asking a bit much.  But the quality was decent, clean, didn't get an upset stomach.    That's my box of chocolate on this place!",

There is almost always a 15-20 minute wait, sometimes even 1+ hour wait during dinner time (6-7pm) it is so worth it though!! Even if you don't like sushi I would still get AYCE and just get tons of appetizers and small side dishes. Sushi comes out super fast and perfect every time. They pretty much know me there already. Yama on Spring Mountain is my go-to spot for dinners with friends and when my sisters and I need to catch up with life. If you're looking for amazing sushi in Vegas. You found it.",

We got there at about 8p and the place was packed.  There was about a 35 minute wait.  My cousin was surprised that the wait was that long especially for a week night.  This restaurant has all you can eat (AYCE) and you can also order off the regular menu as there are different rolls and items not on the AYCE menu.  We just ordered off the AYCE menu but next time we'll order of the other menu as well because the rolls sounded delicious.  What's really cool about this place is that you can order HALF ROLLS!!!! Which means you can try smaller portions if your unsure if you'd like the rolls.  What I didn't like was the soybeans coming out hot and not cooled down.  It's not something that I care for but that's my personal preference.  The service was ok.  They were very busy and they didn't check on us much.  The only time they would really come to the table was when they would bring our ordered items.  Other than that we would have to flag them down.    When I return to Vegas, I would eat here again.",

I only get nigiri at AYCE places, and I got a pretty broad selection. Tuna, Salmon, Ikura, sweet shrimp, etc. I don't know if anything stood out as great, but the Ikura was enjoyable. The salmon in particular stood out as being not so good, and the tuna was forgettable.  But, when you go to an AYCE place you're not expecting the same calibre of fish as you would get at, say, Kabuto. That should be the expectation going in. And I found the fish quality, on the whole, to be acceptable.  Which brings me to the price point--at $24, this is a very reasonably priced AYCE dinner. That gets them up to 4 stars. If it were $29, it'd be 3 stars.   Service was friendly and attentive in spite of being very busy. That helps too.",

    "text": "My cousin and I were super hungry from our 6 hour hike so decided to get AYCE sushi at Yama. Thinking it would live up to its sister over on flamingo, I was hyped.   Walking in, the place was big compared to a lot of the sushi places in town. Probably could fit twice the amount of people.   One of the workers was mopping which already gave me a bad vibe. Don't you usually mop before you open or after you close? It had a strong smell of bleach, which I am not fond of, especially while trying to eat.   Service was great! Water was refilled quite quickly, food was served pretty fast, and the ladies were always checking up on us, asking if we needed anything.   First up, some nigiri. Ordered the super white, yellowtail, eel, salmon, and albacore. Like another reviewer said, the rice was definitely not sushi rice. I usually order a ton of nigiri but these just were not cutting it. Slices were a bit more chewy than normal and if it came with a sauce underneath the rice, it over saturated it.   Second up, Uni. Now I've had some good and bad Uni and these were on the border. For me, I think Uni has a creamy texture with a buttery finish. These had a watery creamy texture with a fishy finish.   We also got the baked green mussels which had their version of a vinegar based sauce on it which were ok.   The best thing we ordered were the kalbi or short ribs. Can't really go wrong or mess those up.   I don't think I'll be coming back here.",

    "text": "We stopped in for a last minute lunch on our way to the airport. AYCE sushi for $21 is a deal! The quality of the sushi was just decent. Our server (didn't get his name) was super nice!  I really enjoyed the rolls. Quality was not comparable to that of what I have here at home (in Hawaii), but it was still good. We had about 6 rolls for our group of 4, 2 shrimp tempura and chicken yakitori. I can't remember all the names of the rolls, but we did get a few that were suggested from the waiter, such as \"no name\" which was my favorite. At the end, we got 1 mochi ice cream each and a scoop of regular (japanese flavored) ice cream. YAY for a great deal!  Service was exceptional. There wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant while we were there, and our waiter was able to refill our drinks and check on us multiple times. Whenever I go back to Vegas, I will be back for AYCE sushi. =)",

We were seated in the darker side which was a bit too dim to read our menus but it was alright and we used our phone light.  The food was very fresh and so good! As always the food here is pretty amazing.  However, I docked a star because the waitress forgot a few of our orders (AGAIN lol see previous review). So we realized we didn't receive our order about 20mins we asked our server again and she said that the order was never placed and she will make another one. I guess they did not have a pen or paper on hand to write all our orders in but I think in the future its okay to write it down and not have to worry about remembering all the orders being requested.  As a All you Can Eat this is the sushi place to go. We haven't ventured out to any other places yet while visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Super disappointed in the service here from my past two visits. This is my family's favorite spot to eat and it saddens me that they have missed the mark with us twice in a row. I definitely understand being busy, but in my opinion it comes down to the servers and sushi chefs lack of communication. I've had to place orders in numerous times only for them to never make it to our table. Manwhore was made poorly and not baked long enough. Long wait to get seated, longer wait to get your food.   The reason this review is getting only 1 star is because they charged me 107.92 the first time because their cashiers put in a tip in the wrong amount. Although they voided it out and charged the correct amount I would have appreciated being in the loop rather than waiting for 20 minutes for our check and an explanation as to what's going on. A dismissive sorry and refusal to give the managers name did not make the situation any better.   I will say if you are lucky enough to have the young Korean lady as your waiter your experience will be nothing like this. She always remembers my son when we come in.   I really hope I'm able to come back to this review and rate Yama what it truly deserves but as of this moment I definitely think their staff needs to go through some training.",

OK, the AYCE was priced average for what we are used to paying. The service was pretty good because everyone that works there comes by to see if you are OK or want to order again. I did like that somewhat. There was nothing here to rave about and we have a regular sushi place that we go to in Vegas and we will be returning to there next trip.  Just super bummed and felt like a \"Bait and switch\" kinda. Yelp needs to make places start over when the business changes it's name or ownership. IMO",

Wide sushi bar, and plenty of tables. Several sushi chefs, and plenty of staff who check up on you, I think that's wonderful!   Sushi is tasty, and comes out fast. They have all the rolls they had before at the other location. Appetizers/sides are a miss for me here. Chicken skewers are hard to chew and dry, I don't recommend it at all. The hamachi kama and salmon kama was disappointing, both were incredibly small and dry.  Seafood salad has shrunk considerably. I would love to see Yama improve this.  I say save your stomach room, and just go for the nigiri and rolls. Do try thier baked rolls, its amazing in the mouth!!",

The server and useless.. when we came in the hostess was telling some of her friends that she hated working there and she was asking them if they were hiring. Very unprofessional. After waiting about 15 minutes to be seated in an almost empty restaurant we were put I a dirty booth. We placed our order and they started bringing out the food and it was quick so no complaints there but I took the first bite and was very disappointed. Then the brought us something we didn't order, we told the waitress and she took it back not ta minute went by when another waitress comes back with the item and she said you ordered this and my husband sits there arguing with her that we didn't when finally the supervisor comes and yells her to just take it. This stop made a great night end in a sour note. Never going there again and maybe this location might want to consider hiring competent servers/chefs if they did I'm sure they would have 5 stars.",

At first we thought it was great, and then we began to notice that it was not fresh fish. We both ordered seafood salad which is supposed to have assorted fish but they gave us 1 type of fish. I'm assuming they were trying to get rid of a certain type of fish to prevent waste. They also did it with my rainbow roll, I didn't see any tuna on the roll. Afterwards my wife and I spent some time in the bathroom, diarrhea trips for the rest of the day for both of us..... Never again will I eat at either Yama. I'm going back to my trusty sushi restaurant that never failed me with long waits or old fish.",

Second, service came around quickly and so did the food. There was no waiting around for anyone or any dish. Sometimes food that I ordered came around so quick I thought they meant it for the other table! Third, food was delicious. I was very pleased with the uni because I've had bad uni before and this was not it. The yellowtail was also nice and fresh. The rolls were also delicious, there was this one called sunset dreams or something that we all loved and kept ordering. Fourth, you can order half rolls! This way you get to try a roll without getting full. Fifth, there's a good selection of appetizers. I thought the soft-shell crab was a delicious item, and one that I hadn't seen in many restaurants. A lot of places service the spider roll but just the crab on its own is a whole another ball game. The yellowtail collar was also good as well. Finally, nice clean atmosphere and spacious setting. Overall, I loved it here and had great food that didn't take forever or cost a ton of money.",

The fish tastes fresh, the service is quick, and the all-you-can eat option is totally worth your money! I recommend this place to all of my friends and it is my go-to sushi spot. It is a must try!",

We used to come to Doh 3-4 times a month and absolutely loved the variety of items on the menu which included no rice rolls(Johnny Roll and Rock N Roll), the spicy garlic edamame, the Coco shrimp, butterfly roll and the lobster roll only to name a few of our favorites. Now all the rolls of the new menu Yama has, everything is drowned in spicy mayo and it's so overpowering! Even the chef's spicy garlic sauce tastes like a spicy mayo and over powering. The quality of the fish was not as good either... The salmon was chewy and they took sashimi off the menu because they don't have high grade fish.  I am totally disappointed and disgusted by so much mayo and all the spice that it almost made me sick. We don't plan on coming back here anytime soon.",

Together with miso soup we had soft shell crab , mussels, takoyaki (very disappointing), seafood salad, tofu, kama and some nigiri. Then my stomach started to act up. I am a sushi lover and never felt sick while eating it. UNI my favorite was disgusting! It taste bitter. The fish in our nigiri is not cold.. we told our server about it and he apologize and he said we need to comment on yelp coz a lot of people complain. He even said since they changed it from Doh to Yama they started buying low class cheaper seafoods/fish. He even told us that the sushi makers were stressed. Lol. And then I told him I feel sick. My stomach hurts he just told me to comment too at yelp! So here it goes..  I FELT SICK EATING HERE!!   Been coming back to the toilet since I got home!  Not coming back to this Location ever!!!",

They weren't too busy for being on a Saturday night.. no wait for a regular table and pretty open seating. When we got to the sushi bar the sushi chef Ginie I believe his name was greeted us immediately. He was very nice and attentive. We had ordered two rolls and got them super quickly, but we didn't even have waters or anything, while we've already been sitting at the empty sushi bar for 15 minutes. Nearly done with our rolls I had to stop a waitress to ask for water.... and only 2 mins after I asked another waitress came and asked if anyone got our drink order. Thanks but, you were 15 minutes too late. The food was delicious, but service was nothing to return for.",

We walked in tonight and the place was not as busy and we asked for a booth. We thought the wait would not be long when we asked, but \"Betty Boop\" (they wear nametafs thatbare not their real names)said it was a 30 minute wait for a booth. We decided to wait for a booth and she actually seated us 5 minutes later. When we got to our booth, Filipino Server (Wolverine) didn't look like he was in the mood and actually looked very irritated when taking our order.   One of our Salmon Nigiri orders had bones in the fish or something crunchy but I believe it was bones. That's so nasty. This place was great when it opened but the service has really gone down hill. They don't come around and ask and follow up even if it was really slow. We had to ask for water refills twice.   I will say this that there are two or theee excellent servers every time we come here. Two of those are Mulan and Go Slow Bro. I don't know if I'll be coming back. Sushi Neko up the road may be my sushi choice when I'm in this area.",

Usually places that are AYCE  give you small rolls obviously so people can finish their food but it you pay for rolls individually they are a lot bigger. I took my rolls back to my room and they were small rolls. They were the AYCE roll size. Taste was ok I felt they can do better. My total for 2 rolls plus edaname was $32.13 I provided them with $35.13 expecting my change back and while waiting at the counter the lady asked if I was expecting my change back?  I answered yes please. Not sure if it's just me but I like to see first how they provide everything before leaving a tip and honestly don't think people should just assume they're leaving the change as tip unless I tell you when I'm giving you my money. So once I get my food I check to see if every thing is there and it's missing my wasabi along with the ginger. Two of the most important things...I did not leave a tip.",

Jasmine was our server and she was super friendly and very attentive to our party. Ditch the overpriced strip restaurants and hit up Yama Sushi. It was a $13 taxi from the Wynn at 7:00 pm on a Saturday night.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite ayce sushi joint in the Las Vegas area. They have the fresher slices of raw sushi and they don't overload the rice. I also like how the rice when it's warm. Other places pre make the rice and it ends up cold and hard.   Like other ayce the rolls are available for half size which is about 4 slices. The uni here was surprisingly not that fishy and the giant clam was fresh! Definitely get the sweet shrimp too! The fried shrimp head was such a great surprise!  Garlic tuna was good but don't dip it in soy sauce... there is already sauces on it and if you do then the sushi becomes way too salty.  The only negative thing was a weird smell in the restaurant... it wasn't Clorox smell but it wasn't entirely a nice smell either. I randomly smelt it while I was eating and it kind of brought the experience down.  One tip: get the red bean ice cream at the end! It was a taste I've never had before!",

The only average things they had were their ala carte options, sides, and their rolls. (Fish you should be looking out for: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, super white tuna, and uni) i haven't tried every fish their but i can say those fish were pretty poor quality.",

Staff was beyond friendly. They all worked with one another to get food out quick, ask us for additional orders and constantly kept dirty plates from sitting on our table.   If I was to change one thing, it would be the interior design. It was kinda blah. Didn't have a welcoming or exciting feel to it.   Other than that service was great, staff was great, food was fresh and amazing!  Price is unbeatable! $23.95 for dinner AYCE!",

    "text": "I was shocked when I saw Yama2 only has 3 1/2 stars on yelp! This place is 5/5 in my book. I love their AYCE menu. It has appetizers galore for those who want to hang out but aren't huge fans of traditional sushi. There are plenty of nirigri options and the lunch menu really isn't that different than the dinner (highly recommend coming for lunch, so you safe a few $$). The specialty rolls are great and I love that you can order half rolls of pretty much anything! That way you can try them all and not worry about trying to finish everything.  I love the fish quality here. I've never had anything short of fresh and delicious. Their nigiri uses a little bit of rice, unlike some places that try to fill you up with cold, hard chunks of rice and charge you for it!  Service is always quick, even when they are busy. They're also very friendly whenever I come too.  Pro tip: if you want to try and space out your food but don't want to wait to order, make sure you order some nigiri and non baked items at the same time as the deep fried, or specialty things. This makes all the food come out in small batches, but you only have to order a couple of times and you don't have to try and flag down your server!   Another pro tip: try it all. You'll love it.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner one night as mom wanted to come to this place. I had always been a bit skeptical about going to this Yama since i didn't have that good of an experience at the other Yama on Flamingo.   We had came here on a Tuesday night, seated fairly quickly as soon as we arrived. We had ordered some stuff to test out the place. Tuna, White Tuna, Yellow tail, salmon, sweet shrimp, giant clam, ikura, uni, tuna poki salad, soft shell crab, agedashi tofu, hamachi kama, dynamite, salmon skin hand roll, custom handroll consisting of salmon, avocado, and ikura.   Out of the top items ordered, the best was...... the custom hand roll. Belly portion of the salmon so a fatty piece of salmon with ikura and avocado. The salmon nigiri was decent but only 2 of the 4 pieces. 2 were ok fatty, 2 were lean.   Worst? tuna poki. dont know what the heck they used in terms of sauce but it was gross. Not any kind of poke i've ever had. Seemed like a variety of sauces mixed with each other. Flavors dont meld well together. Was spicy, salty, weird bittery taste. I dont even want to think if the tuna was fresh or not.  Hamachi kama was huge but flavorless. Wasn't seared/broiled enough.   Nigiri overall, the rice was gross. Mushy.   Yellowtail had some ponzu sauce over it with green onions.   Giant clam (geoduck) is not fresh. Does not have that \"crisp\" feeling. Kind of mushy.   Salmon skin handroll consisted of bitsy pieces of salmon with little skin. Not crispy at all. Salmon meat way more than skin.  Should call it a cooked salmon hand roll  Not a fan of rolls to begin with so didnt order any of those. Didn't see anything that stood out that wasnt covered in sauces or weird.   The soft shell crab had a weird batter. Very different from what you'd find from other restaurants. Theirs flakes off too easily.   Service wise, it was attentive in some aspects but unattentive in other aspects. It took a while for us to get the check and dessert but they were fairly good with refilling tea and taking orders.   Overall, meh. Definitely not a fan of this place. Not for those who are interested in nigiri. Rolls and what not may be better but not my cup of tea. Not to mention the parking is horrible at most meal times here.",

The food was great however the seat attendant told us it would take 20 minutes before we could be seated ended up being well over an hour and a half.   After we got a table, one of the waitresses was placing a Styrofoam cup of apple juice on the table when it tore & spilled onto my daughter and niece. Just thanking God it wasn't a hot beverage. We didn't blame the waitress, but hoping the restaurant can invest in some higher quality products.   There was a bit of attitude from the waitresses while taking our orders as well. My 2 year old is a picky eater, but she loves the miso soup with the extra tofu (that's all she eats at Sushi restaurants) so I specifically asked for it. When it came out, It was evident the bowl did not have much tofu. My daughter finished it quickly and asked for more. I asked the waitress for another bowl with more tofu than the last. And she told me they're working on it and rolled her eyes.    If it wasn't for the larger space, we probably wouldn't choose this Yama restaurant over the other one.",

    "text": "I've been to the other Yama Sushi location before, and decided to come to this one (closer to my house) when my mom came to visit. Neither of us had had lunch, so we were starving and chose AYCE sushi for dinner. We came at prime dinnertime, and had to park a few streets over, but the wait was only about 15 minutes before we were seated.  Service was variable. Initially, servers were very attentive and refilled waters and took orders, but later on during our meal, we had to work a little to flag people down. Nonetheless, the service provided was fine, and you don't really get assigned a single waiter/waitress.  The menu is fairly extensive and everything is included in AYCE (except some items can only be ordered once). I like the variety of items here, between appetizers, nigiri, and rolls. The quality was decent for all you can eat, and price around $25 per person for dinner.  The interior is sleek and fairly nice, though it is not huge so it can get busy and is fairly noisy.  Overall, there are so many AYCE sushi places to choose from in town, and Yama Sushi is a solid offering.",

The place is clean good ambiance and you get seated right away. I was by myself and still got offered table or booth but chose the bar. Teletobi made sure I was never waiting for a plate.  I had plates I would have never ordered at some sushi places..as they are not exactly sushi but but since here you can choose AYCE alternative all you can eat and it is not a buffet bar...it is AYCE plate by plate freshly made. I had the greatest seafood salad y Hamachi Kama. Be adventurous and try some plates. Read what is in it ....as you should not leave food uneaten.  Common courtesy to keep the good operation of the place.  The value the experience the flavors of there were six stars  I would give it. This place at either of its two locations is a must. Spring mountain location closes 2am for late night bites while Flamingo location closes at 11pm.",

Just a note that this is all you can eat for only certain items on the menu. There are limits on the more desirable menu items. Uni, giant clam, etc.   Totally understandable except for when the waitress continues to take your order for said items and does not ever return. A bus boy ended up checking up on our order only to find out it was never put in after we patiently waited 30+ minutes. The manager apologized and explained sometimes the waitress make mistakes and take orders they shouldn't.   It happens but shouldn't our table have been notified so that we could re-order other items instead of our waitress \"disappearing\"? Seems like a total move to reduce the amount of food our table could order. It now makes a lot of sense why all the staff have \"character\" themed names and not their real ones displayed on their name tags. I will not be returning here and I do not recommend this place for an all you can eat experience.",

I was kinda bummed my sushi chef didn't come to the new location but I still would drive to the old location to visit him occasionally. And then long behold, my sushi guy transferred over to the Spring Mtn location! Yay!!!! Paow is so much fun and I love how he always surprises us with his own concoctions! He makes this place that much better!  The place is always clean. The food is fresh and amazing! For the price you pay, it's definitely well worth a visit! I send my clients here when they ask for a sushi suggestion and they all thank me a billion times over and over, especially when they are fortunate enough to be entertained and served by Paow!",

From the second I sat down I was welcomed to a world of sushi and food I had never experienced before. Everything was just perfect from the speed of making the food to the fantastic service and then the food was unparalleled in taste. Thank you for making my dining experience so great!",

I like this place better just because it's more open and tables are not too close to each other. The wait staff is very helpful and all smiles.  The sushi I order reflects my taste as I rarely order any type of roll. The food is good and when you order, comes out quickly. Fish is fresh, rice not too big... Price is affordable considering the type of food you're getting.... I will be back soon",

Not packed but by time we left at 3 there was a 20 min wait.   AYCE at a good price ($20). Speciality rolls were really good. Nigiri/sashimi also good.  Fish was fresh and tasty.   Waitresses were not very friendly and service was very slow. Was there 2 hours and got a water refill once. Took 20 min to get them to come take order for more rounds. Then took us 15 minutes to get our cards taken back for pymt.   Two sushi rolls never came out and had to ask again for them.   Good food, decent price, ok location and ok service.",

It was open at midnight on a Tuesday and therefore we went.   The sashimi, Yama rolls and all of the other rolls that are included in the $25 can't be beat. Included was also miso soup and edename and some ice cream.   We ate until we hit the food wall. My only regret is that I couldn't eat anymore. Everything we tried was delicious. Ask for the yellowtail belly. Spicy tuna, exceptional. The Yama sauce, I wish I could buy. The sushi chefs were extremely friendly and knowledgeable and told us exactly what we should order.   Fantastic experience, can't wait to go back to Yama!",

The sushi chefs are great, the food always tastes fresh, and everything in AYCE comes out in a timely manner.   This new Yama on Spring Mountain is also just as good. More spacious than the other Yama (I believe it used to be Doh sushi and tapas? I remember the set up being very similar), but with the same good sushi chefs and fish :) the menu is the same as the old one, but I felt that this one had a lot of character as far as the servers (cool names btw)! The Servers were very attentive asking if we needed anything and how things were AND they didn't rush us when ordering food. The food that we ordered came out SUPER QUICK. The appetizers actually did come first, which is  different because they normally take longer because they're fried, and then alllll the rolls and nigiri we ordered came together. (granted, we always order a lot up front because they take a while, but this place was on point).   (However, the only bad part about everything coming at once and then ordering more at different times is that things tend to get lost. My friend order 3 more items, all of which did not get to us by the time we decided to get the bill and dessert. )  I would definitely come back just based on the sushi and the service (just make sure to keep track of your orders!), and now I might always go to this location for the speed :)",

The venue has an amazing staff that kept things moving, clean, filled and HAPPY throughout our dine in.  Greeted and seated in record time. Our server did not skip a beat to take care of us as soon as we got seated. If you read my reviews, you know how we order when it comes to sushi. Abundance!  What ordered:  Appetizers -  Baked green mussels Fried green mussels Mix poke salad Seafood salad Salmon kama Miso soup Tofu agedashi Soft-shell crab  Negiri -  Salmon Yellowtail White tuna Uni Sweet shrimp with head Albacore Salmon roe  Sushi -  Double salmon hand roll Spicy tuna roll Ellen roll No name roll  Desert -  Green tea ice cream Mango mochi  I'm pretty sure that I'm missing more. But yes, we are now back to being regulars here. Fish to rice ratio is perfect. The baked mussels compared to Kaya is so much better. Not drowned in the cream cheese sauce and use whole mussels, not combining small ones to make it look huge. Timing on distribution was immaculate considering we order alot. As soon as a plate left, another took its place. No cluttered table, and no empty glasses. For the price point, value and quality, Yama hit the spot this night.   In addition to the food, the service was on par tonight. No wait time in between ordering what so ever. Definitely a great improvement and a nice turn around. Well earned 5 stars.",

    "text": "This place is one of THE BEST AYCE sushi restaurants in the last Vegas area. I'm from Los Angeles, CA where there's plenty of AYCE sushi joints and there's none that can compare to this one. The closest contender is a 6 if Yama is a 10. The fish is fresh, rice on nigiri isn't excessively huge or wet like someone soaked it in seasoned vinegar for days. My best advice is to ask for all the limited order items first because those are the best. Then make your selections from the many other ayce items.  Other than the food, the service is great too and to top it off, they \"service with a smile ,\" which is a +++ no matter if the food is bad and even better when it's good. The waitresses all have a positive customer service attitude and the supervising waitress does a really good job making sure customers are taken cared of. Additionally, unlike many ayce joints, they don't mind seating you first even if your entire party hasn't arrived.  When you're traveling with hungry kids, this is a Godsend and I didn't realize how nice that was until finally, an AYCE place will let my starving impatient kids EAT first while my NEVER ON TIME brother arrives 15 minutes later.   I hope the quality of food and service at Yama remains unchanged and at the time of writing this and for my last two visits it's been consistently Great! Though their inventory of Yellow Tail Collar goes really quick and Salmon Collar remains a deelish option, but nonetheless, ITS STILL GOOD! So I've made a pledge to myself to skip the Caesar Palace Bacchanal Buffet (think it's $80/person) and come to Yama (like $24/person) instead.  Or do both, but YAMA first!",

    "text": "Terrible customer service from the moment we stepped into the door. 3 workers were too busy taking down Christmas decorations in the front entrance to notice 4 of us had walked in. After I got their attention, they seated us to our table. Our waiter named Jack stood over us without saying a word until I asked for waters for us all to drink. When Jack returned, I proceeded to order for the table. I ordered 2 lunch specials for my aunts and a salmon teriyaki and California roll for myself. Jack just a looked at me in total confusion not understanding what I saying. I even pointed to the selection from the menu. Jack was still confused. I knew I should've asked for another waiter in the moment but tried to work with Jack. Jack kept thinking I wanted 3 orders of my selection and i was starting to become frustrated. I pointed again to the menu and said that one person wanted a soup and the other wanted a salad for their side item. Jack said ok, barely wrote anything down and went off. 10 minutes later after several other people got their food, even though we were one of the first people to walk in, I kept looking around for Jack and he was no where to be found. Five minutes later our soup and salad came out. 10 minutes after that my lunch had come. My aunts' lunches never came. I practically finished my meal and still no food. I found Jack and asked if the food was coming, and all he said was \"yes\" and walked away. We asked Jack again for a manager and he said the manager wasn't there. He never apologized for the wait and kept saying they are making it now. After being there for 45 minutes, the lunch finally came out and another waitress said that the slip never printed out. Probably because Jack didn't even understand what I ordered in the first place. We told another waitress we weren't interested in the food at this point and would just pay for the one order. Jack never even came back to our table. On our way out, my young child had to squeeze her way through the door way where a man was now on a ladder taking down more Christmas decorations. The was the one of the worse dining experiences I have had in China town. Beware, if Jack is your server, ask for a new person who understands English and actually understands the menu. I will not be coming back here again.",

Oh and they also had poke lol so good. Price was 23.95 a person for dinner when I went not bad if you paying for quality food but def pricy for my standards",

I'm not a big complainers but the resin I wrote this because we had a talk to the manager and it seems like he doesn't even care so i decided to write on here. I'm not one of those customers that said it's okay at the restaurant and rant about it later.  Receptionist girl, i don't know she keeps this job. No smile, no thank you, no welcome. I know what she does best, looking/texting on her personal phone.  It's so sad cuz the flamingo location did such a great job and I hope this location is just a franchised.  Back to Lester, he was so intentive way more than our unknown sever.   At the end, I'll never be back to this location ever again. Thank you very much.",

The vegetable and vegan rolls were pretty much the same don't be fooled. I will give them 5 stars on their customer service just wish the food matched.",

    "text": "Lol at all these salty people writing bad reviews just because their \"favorite\" sushi spot got taken over. How can you expect a different restaurant to serve the same type of sushi that you're used to?   Personally, I love the new look. Came here on a Saturday night and was seated 20mins later on CES weekend. Since every restaurant on Spring Mtn had a wait, we looked no further. Everything seemed promising until I was handed over a dirty menu with soy sauce stains all over it. My miso soup tasted like bleach. I had also ordered a few nigiri rolls with Quail egg at an extra charge- but it somehow came out not inside the roll. Not sure why the server didn't even apologize or offer to make me another one.   Me and my boyfriend also couldn't help but notice how every single roll going out to tables were abnormally ginormous... with too much rice. Like a ridiculous amount that I could possibly be full after 2 rolls. Wow Vegas, you like this kinda AYCE? You like to eat ALL YOU CAN EAT RICE?    Cute server uniforms, creative name badges, water and tea refilled spontaneously. Pretty wall they had installed on the right which looks like you're somewhere in the Himalayas. Other than that, will not be coming back.   If you're a visitor then you're better off somewhere else. Jjanga's, Umiya, Sushi Takashi are excellent alternatives not far from where you are.",

I finally visited the new Sushi Yama and i couldnt believe it.... they took out all the good dishes that i used to come here for.

She took our order incorrectly multiple times and forgot orders we placed. It takes little to no time to write an order down while it is being placed. Write. Orders. Down.",
