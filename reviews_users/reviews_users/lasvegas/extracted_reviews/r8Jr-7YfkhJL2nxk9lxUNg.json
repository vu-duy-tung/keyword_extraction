    "text": "This is my go-to for Mexican fare when I'm on the West side.  I've been coming here since they opened; Frank was a lot younger then and had a few more hairs on his head.  The restaurant business can be difficult, I imagine, but throughout the years I've received great service and some damn fine Mexican fare here; oftentimes served up by the man Frank himself.  My visit usually goes like this:  I order a Cazadores Cadillac margarita to set the mood while I peruse the menu for what I promise once again will be something different.  Nope, not a chance...give me the usual; chips and guacamole and then an order of chicken enchiladas.  Why mess with perfection?  This combo has never let me down.  I tried going outside of my comfort zone once at a competitors restaurant and ordered the chicken chimichanga.  Too much grease for my liking so I continue to stick with what I've been ordering here since day one.  The ambiance here is quite nice and even when crowded you can still hear others at your table very easily.  This place also passes my restroom white glove test...always clean, always hot water, always fresh paper towels.  It's nice when the details are not overlooked.  Check the place out if you're in the area and tell Frank that Cristobol sent you.",

    "text": "If you enjoy delicious more traditional Mexican food that isn't full of grease (let's face it some people do), then this is the place for you! For the past 5 years we've been driving 20 minutes to eat here! The staff is friendly and attentive, and the environment is casual, but nicely decorated.    The complimentary 2 baskets of chips and salsa are so addicting and I position the basket away from myself. Tip: if you like it spicy ask for the HABANERO SAUCE to add some heat. Flavor is great either way though.  The RED SANGRIA is really good and you get A LOT for your $. I usually will share with a friend. Friends who've ordered the white sangria wished they had ordered the red. I also enjoy the MARGARITAS on the rocks!  My husband ALWAYS orders and loves THE COLORADO...it's his favorite and he is not the adventerous food type.  I personally am not afraid to mix it up, but I always order my food with either CHICKEN OR CARNE ASADA. When I want to be healthy--er I get the a la carte soft corn tacos. When I get what I want...it's the SWEET POTATO ENCHILADAS!!! I have to say this flavor isn't for everyone...but I LOVE THEM! The CLASSIC AND MOLE CHICKEN ENCHILADAS are great, too...frankly, I have never eaten anything here (with chicken or carne asada) that I didn't like. At our last visit, I tried the PANUCHO-carne asada...yummy, but I hate it when my tortillas gets soggy, which happened after I ate the first one, so I would flip them over next time.  Dessert...well to be honest I stuff myself with chips and salsa (food I would have as a last meal) so I never have room...but I bet it's good :)  BOTTOM LINE: I love this place and it's always worth and the calories...and the drive!",

    "text": "This Is one of the top places on our list of must eats as we spend our summer in Las Vegas. We live in Japan now, so when we get to come back, we want to see family, friends and to EAT at our favorite places.  Unfortunately, this was a bad night to go and it shouldn't have been. For a Tuesday, this place was really busy and we were happy to see them doing so good. We were seated fairly quickly and the buser/bring you chips and drinks guys were tops. For as busy as it was, they were hustling. However, for the 30 or 40 tables in the busy place, there was only 1 waiter. A nice enough ol' guy on any other night, but he was far too overwhelmed and they should have made any one of the other 3 front end employees (2 of which, I know have been there for years) a step in waiter to take care of this surprise dinner rush.   After several times the waiter passed us by, without even looking in our direction, I finally got up and tracked him down at the service window and told him we had been there quit some time. After a few minutes, he finally remembered to look for us and find our table and we gave him our order. Very simple, very easy, anyone could have managed this task. Later he took my wife's water glass to get her a refill, and we never saw it again, LOL at this point.  Now on to the food. I was commenting on it as we drove there as to how I didn't remember ever having anything I didn't like. Well, tonight, meh!  My wife ordered the 2 piece chicken dinner. I told her it was a good choice as I've had it many times. Well it came to her a bit more charred than normal and very dry. I ordered the Chicken Frank and it was just ok. A very small portion of chicken (about one flat chicken fingers worth) made the chili relleno look like the star of the show, kinda sad for Chicken Frank.  The buser/food runner guys were great and apologetic and also wondering why they weren't tasked to take orders, but it was out of their hands. When we first arrived, we were really happy to see the ol' place busier than ever; however, tonight's execution was beyond poor. My tip wasn't large, but I hope it all goes to the food runners.   We have been here many times and will absolutely come back to give it another chance as this is probably the only time we've had a problem with either food or service at this otherwise, and on any other day, stellar example of good Mexican food.",

I have been frequenting Frank & Fina's for about 2 years now, and I have to say that the vegetable taquitos never get old. =) While my guests are always equally impressed with the dishes they choose, from all over the menu, I am always afraid to stray from my favorite!  Vegans rejoice at the extensive offerings you have here along with the fact that all of the servers and chefs know what \"no cheese\" or \"dairy free\" means. (Come on, you know that you've been to similar eateries before where you say \"no cheese on the burrito, please\" (because the menu doesn't list cheese as a topping on the side of beans, as well) and then your beans come out smothered in cheese!  Thanks, Frank & Fina's for delicious food every time!",

Free chips and salsa Cheap but delicious food Friendly and attentive wait staff (our bus boy was helping out the waiter so we wouldn't be sitting there waiting)  The only things we didn't like was not enough chorizo in the queso fundido, it was still delicious. The horchata was from a powder mix (we had to stir it a bit more to get it mixed well enough).   I got the pork chile verde, it comes with rice and beans. The rice is amazing, I love Mexican rice when it's done right. The beans were also really good and come in a little tostada cup. I really like that they do this because it keeps the beans from getting all over the food. The pork was delicious. Best I've had.   For dessert we got the coconut flan. I have mixed feelings about it because I was expecting coconut flavored flan, this was regular flan with toasted coconut on top. Still good just not as good as I hoped.  Our server was an older man, such a sweetie. All in all for 2 adult plates, 1 kid's plate, 1 appetizer and 1 dessert and 3 drinks was about $50. Loved it!",

My enchilada had sour cream on top, which was a nice touch, but overall wasn't anything special.  I can say the space was nice and service was very quick. I'll give them another try because prices were fairly reasonable and there might be some hidden gems on the menu to seek out... In the meantime I'll stick with my go-to places for Mexican !",

Little did I know the most perfect chile relleno was just here in my home town, at Frank & Fina's Cocina! We tried their steak uxtal & chuletas... needless to say our plates were licked clean! Am very picky when it comes to mexican food, this is the only place I will go to! Prices are reasonable & definitely worth every bite! The staff & atmosphere is friendly, clean...u might even catch a glimpse of the Frank & Fina themselves humbly working in their beloved restaurant! If you are looking for a good authentic delicious mexican place, come here, u won't regret it!",

    "text": "Frank & Fina's is bomb!  As much as I like hole in the wall Mexican joints, sometimes we want to get away from the barrage of \"combo plates\" and just get some good food.  The service here is excellent.  The waiters are super nice and very attentive to make sure you have water and complimentary chips and salsa.  Frank & Fina's is also decorated very nicely except this halogen light near the bar area....kinda ruins the well decorated eatery.  We've been here twice and one time I ordered the steak torta and also have eaten the steak burrito enchilada style.  The steak torta was so flavorful and I would have to say that it's going to be my staple at Frank & Fina's.  The steak burrito was a little to saucy and cheesy for me.  But, I was trying something new.  My wife had ordered the Chicken plate.  It comes with a quarter grilled chicken, rice, beans, and some tortillas.  This was delicious and I would recommend it to anyone.  They have a bunch of different Mexican deserts which we opted not to have since we were so full.  If you haven't been to Frank & Fina's don't hesitate because the food is awesome and the services is 110%!",

I don't think they even own a microwave or a freezer, because everything tastes really fresh and flavorful.  The free chips and salsa is perfect, fresh made chips and just the right heat on the salsa.  I always get a salad with the house dressing, which is like a creamy vinaigrette. Yum.  I try to get something different every time and it's all very good.  Have never had a bad experience here.  The only \"bad\" thing is that the potions are big and you don't want to stop eating because it's so good and before you know it you've eaten too much and want to sleep the rest of the day away.  If you like fresh and healthy mexican food, you MUST go here!",

As a matter of fact, the guacamole was Terrible=watered down, no spices, and tasted \"shiny\" (you know what I mean right?). Yuck. There was absolutely no difference b/t the Carne Asada and the Rib-eye except the price. Lame.   Benefits of going here were: no wait on a Friday night, good service, decent atmosphere (not romantic, but not blaring terribly loud music either).   I'd rather go to Pepe's Tacos (any location). Its cheaper, tastier, and they serve Manzanita (apple flavored soda)!",

After living in Mexican food wilderness (New York) for about 10 years my girlfriend and I made our way to Vegas.   After trying several Mexican places here I stumbled upon the original Frank & Fina's on Charleston (now torn down) and followed them to their new location near Flamingo and 215.   I've enjoyed their Tampaquena, Chile Rellanos and Enchiladas. While not the greatest on the planet Frank & Fina's is always satisfying. It's well priced and very accommodating.",

But upon entering F&F's you know right away that this is going to be a good experience.  The atmosphere is friendly right from the beginning and decor is one that makes you really feel in the mood for Mexican food.  The waiters are very nice and prompt and help with any questions (i usually have a few).  The food came fast and tasted as good, if not better, than any Mexican food I've had.   The prices are very reasonable and I can't wait to get in the mood for Mexican food again so I can go.",

For about $20.00 per person (including tax) we got a massive amount of food, 3 types of fajitas (including shrimp, which was incredibly tasty and plentiful) carnitas empanadas, spinach and cheese tamales, and the tastiest cheese enchiladas I ever had. They were so soft, they tasted like they were wrapped in pasta, not tortillas. All this plus rice, beans, guacamole salsa, lettuce, cheese and tortillas. Everybody was very impressed by the food. I was also VERY impressed by the personal service, the owners themselves brought the food and helped me set it up. Very nice people, and Fina, the lady who helped me with the order, was very helpful, professional and pleasant. I highly recommend this restaurant!",

I hear the flour tortilla ones are amazing. They offer vegan and vegetarian dishes as well. From all of the dishes I've tried they are all well flavoured and taste like traditional Mexican food.  Some of their salsas are actually really spicy so When you do take away you do have to specify what you want because it is easy to mix up your order.

We always like to start off our Mexican dining experiences with chips and guacamole. The serving of guacamole is much larger than what most places serve. It is chunky and you can tell it is home made. There is nothing worse for me than ordering guacamole and find out there is no chunks of veggies in it. It was also very yummy! There is always more then enough to take home too!  I have eaten at Frank & Finas  a couple of times so here are some of the items I have tried.   I have had their whole chicken legs with Spanish rice. I usually don't like chicken because sometimes it smells weird too me but it was really good! The Spanish rice here is delicious! It isn't bland it tastes like it has a bit of a garlic flavor for to it which was a pleasant surprise!   I have also tried their beef, potatoes with the Spanish rice. I was also happy with this dish. The beef was tender and I loved mixing the meat and potatoes with the rice.   Now for the drinks and desserts:  I ordered the pomegranate margarita because I don't see this offered a lot. It was a perfect mix of sweet alcoholic bliss! It was also a nice pink color which I loved!  I had their churros with ice cream which was good. The churros were nice and warm and had caramel inside. I liked eating it with the ice cream.   My favorite dessert was their tricolor sorbets. I believe the flavors were lime, strawberry and Pineapple . It was very refreshing especially on a hot day!",

I am not necessarily a margarita fan but I was in the mood and these were tasty. Simple and good. We ordered some of the bean dip as an appetizer which was excellent. It is such a SIMPLE appetizer but it was perfect. It had melted cheese and pico on top. I mixed a little salsa in it and man, it was good.  For entrees we ordered a couple of tacos, taquitos, and a chile relleno. Everything was delicious. Well seasoned. One of the best rellenos we have ever had.   The only possible complaint I have is on the service. It was a little slow and we had two different servers. I don't know if they were trying to help one another out or what, but they would cross over on service. For example: both of them asked us at different times if we were finished and ready for our bill. But other than this one small issue, I was happy. I am definitely going back.",

The steak tips looked more like chopped steak'um sandwich meat than what I consider steak tips, but was still decent.    Service is always amazingly fast.   Chips/salsa met me at the table!   Margarita was just 3 minutes behind!!    Prices are ok...$60 for dinner + drinks for 2.  There's probably cheaper out there but there's something about this place I love.     Attire is low key.  It's not upscale by any means but date night clothes or super casual Sunday afternoon shorts both work.    Drinks are yummy.  Go straight to the Cadillac margarita & the red sangria is full of Apple chunks (a little small so they can clog up the straw...annoying!)  If you hate peppers or onions, be sure to ask to leave them out.   Even though they may not be in the entree description it's highly likely they're in there somewhere.",

And never once was ever changed for a few extra tortillas like this place. We ordered fajitas at Franks, mind you they are a good size, and not to bad either. However they give you 3 very small flour tortillas, for all the fajitas they give you? Thought that was weird so I asked the bus guy, can we just get 2 or 3 more tortillas to finish off the fajitas.... well... no one said they would be $2 extra. I just could believe they would even charge someone for that. That's just like charging a table for a 2nd round of chips and salsa. Anyways will not go back..and had to tell 3 different people we were never told it was extra for some cheap ass flour tortillas. Won't ever go back! Not mexican etiquette at all.",

We arrived at 7pm and we were greeted by a friendly hostess who informed us that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table. FYI - They do take reservations if you call before 5pm the same day.       After getting seated, we were immediately welcomed by our waiter and asked what we'd like to drink. When the older gentleman returned with the drinks we were given the specials of the night. I ordered the Steak Milanesa (thinly sliced steak that is breaded) which is also served with your choice of tortillas, rice and beans. Our table also ordered an appetizer of guacamole and some melted cheese dish topped with green chiles, chorizo, and salsa fresca. The guacamole was tasty and had big chunks of tomato. The cheese dish was over the top delicious! We didn't realize it came with tortillas, so we ate it with chips.        My Steak Milanesa was tasty. The meat was moist and I felt like I could cut it with my the side of my fork. The beans were refried pinto beans and they were served in a crunchy tortilla bowl and then topped with a sprinkle of Mexican cheese. The rice was a bit dry for my liking.       I will most definitely return to Frank & Fina's Cocina. The atmosphere is welcoming, the prices are good, and the food portions will definitely fill your belly. What really set this place apart was the personal touch the wait staff added. They were quick with recommendations, and we even got served by Frank himself!",

There are at least SIX DIFFERENT vegetarian options, which is huge. I tried the chile relleno and vegetable tamale combo, which was excellent. The fact that they even offered veggie tamales was unusual (and appreciated.)  The only downside I found was that they charge $2 if you split a dish. I'm not sure if this is an added gratuity or something, but I don't think much of it. I suppose not everyone know or follows the \"tip as if you ordered two entrees\" rule, so it's not a huge issue.

My husband was particularly impressed that you can order roasted chicken by the pieces served with flour or corn tortillas. I agree that is a unique option.

I called the store to speak with the manager and she was very rude. She said 'I'm not sure what you want...are you asking for free soup?' I was BAFFLED. I said that I wanted a refund because I didn't get what I ordered and she responded with 'we don't do that.' She said the best she could do is give me free chips and salsa during my next visit. I told her that I didn't plan on returning and she said 'she understands.'  Rather than refunding a $6 cup of soup, they would rather lose a customer. Disappointing because their food was actually pretty good.",

My children love the Soups, Taquitos, Nachos (salsa on the side) and Quesadillas.  Although, it appears that the side portions are premeasured in the little bowl shaped shells for the beans and the round rice mound, the servings are quite generous and very filling!  The staff is very friendly and the service is fast and professional. I always get the feel that \"Mi Casa es Su Casa\" at Frank and Fina's.",

    "text": "My wife and I used to love, love, LOVE, this place.  The last two times we went, last night and three months ago, the food and service were absolutely dreadful.  I have a feeling they changed owners or are on hard times because the portions became very small (they used to give you a burrito the size of Roberto's or a large tortilla, now they use the small tortilla.  They measure the rice with one of those cups you usually get ranch dressing in.  You know this because that's what the rice is shaped like on your plate.  The meat inside the burrito has been reduced dramatically.)    Wife ordered carne asada chimichanga.  The plate was loaded with grease and the meat was super greasy with no taste.  I had the carnitas burrito.  The \"pork\" was very strange tasting as it didn't taste like the carnitas burrito I've had there about 5 times.  The pork tasted more like shredded beef.  Little meat in the burrito as I gave my wife a taste of a piece of pork and it made a dent in the tortilla showing where the tiny piece of meat came from.  The chips were REALLY stale also.  The waitress was miserable and not once came by to ask us how everything was, she ONLY took the order.  The bus boy did everything.  I gave him the tip.    This is my first Yelp review and the only reason I write it is because we used to love this place so much and it is a shame to see it turn to crap.  We didn't recognize any people on our last visit and the waitresses were so miserable and lethargic, it was sad.  I really hope Frank and Fina are ok since I doubt they have anything to do with this restaurant now.  I made a joke parking that the sign was off outside and wondered if they were going to change the name soon.",

    "text": "This is my youngest son's and his sweetheart's favorite Mexican restaurant. They've been wanting to take me here for years now. Maybe it was best that I waited...  Chips and Salsa (** 1/2) Warm Tortilla Chips. Salsa was watery, and needed a bit of Green Onions!  Queso Fundido (** 1/2 $6.75) Melted Queso Cheese and Chorizo Dip with Pico de Gallo - served with Flour Tortillas. Where was the Chorizo? Saw the remnants... Reddish Oil... must've been the meatless Chorizo. Once I added the Pico de Gallo.... tasted OK. Otherwise the Queso is just not Cheesey enough! Hint to Frank & FIna's... try adding Roasted Chile's to Queso to give it a bite! Or how about some Jalapeno?  Al Pastor Dinner (*** $10.95) Marinated Red Pork. Barbecued Pork... way, way overcooked. Tough and chewy. My son had the Cochinita Pibil... the marinated Pork in that dish was nice and tender and flavorful. What happened to the Al Pastor? Side included a Tortilla cup of Refried Beans and a pile of Mexican Rice, and Flour Tortillas, which did not look home-made despite the claim.  Sangria Carafe (**** $5.50) Bits of Apple and Lime in the Sangria mixture! Highlight of the evening... for me.  Found out tonight that son's fiancee / gf likes Albondigas Soup... she has pretty good taste, Kevin.  Inexpensive, and a very, very popular Mexican restaurant - not one empty seat in the house tonight! It seems, from the entrees I tried tonight, this restaurant is very non-committal in the preparation of their items... maybe trying not to offend anyone?  Maybe, I just ordered the wrong entree! Just do not see the fascination with Frank & Fina's Cocina!",

It has a very neighborhood feel.  It is very affordable and delicious.    Margaritas are $5  - try to find that elsewhere.  Sangria is $10 but is served in a little carafe that holds 2 glasses.    I just dined the other day and everything was tasty and friendly as usual.  The chicken or steak and avocado salad is always a winner.  Lots of steak, sliced red onions, cucmbers, and big slices of fresh avocado all drizzled with house vinaigrette make it a mexican style salad you can sink your teeth into but not feel guilty about.  Their soups are excellent.  I am a big fan of the albondigas (meatball).  It tastes just like a sweet little grandma made it.  Hearty chunks of carrot, chayote, potato, and big flavorful meatballs all on a hot hot slurpable broth.  I usually do a bowl of that and 2 a la carte tacos for a perfect lunch!  They have other winners that I reccomend trying like the sweet potato enchiladas (yup!) and the chuletas - yummy pork chops tossed with copious amounts of blackend onions, served with tortillas and all the goods.  It isn't THE best Mexican you have ever had in your life....but it is very good, very affordable, and a nice place to sit and dine.",

This place would be comparable to a Lindo Michocan meal without the expensive price tag. When me and my wife we always seem to order the same thing.   Salmon Salad 4.5/5- My wife always orders this and she says its one of her favorite salads to eat period. Also she loves their dressings here and she seems to alwasy finish her plate. I like that they cook salmon perfectly because most salmon salads cook the salmon where its too dry.  Chompoton 4.5/5- it is definitely my go to dish its rib Eye steak and with shrimp fajitas also with refried beans rice and salad and big portion of guacamole & go with corn tortillas. I crave eating this.  Its your mexican surf and turf and for a very reasonable price. I love how i can have a bite of steak then shrimp with some grilled onions and peppers with guacamole and smooth out my meal with some beans and rice.    Appetizers we usually go with.  Empanadas 3.5/5- ooey go cheese filled with ground beef that also comes with guacamole,pico de gallo, and a southwest sauce which is pretty good.  You dont have to order an appetizer if youre on a budget  for you get chips and salsa but you can always add a side of refried beans for dipping and its good as well.  This place is always been a solid choice and because everything is very simple and service is always good. The place always is clean and you can bet that youll get a solid meal without the expensive price.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Frank & Fina's seemingly forever.  Well, not when they were on Charleston, about 9 years ago.  Then it looked a little dive-y.  But I've heard such good things about it that we finally went for dinner.  The ambience has everything I love:  first, it looks traditionally Mexican, with flowers painted above archways, beautiful typical artesanias, such as a stunning copper-framed mirror, and servers who, if not Mexican, are identifiably Latina; none of that earnest young college student \"hi, I'm Trevor and I'll be your server tonight\" stuff here.  Mariachi and ranchero music played softly in the background.  Both of those musical genres can be raucous, but the volume was just right, allowing for conversation without screaming.  After verifying that the house Sangria was spiked with more than just Sprite, we ordered the carafe.  I was grateful that this 16 oz existed.  We can't handle a pitcher, and I was driving.  It was excellent Sangria, with a lot of fruit.  I would have appreciated it if the fruit pieces had been a little larger than the tiny dice, making it difficult to fish out of the glasses.  I liked the chips, but was surprised that the salsa was not as hot as I would have liked, and I don't like extreme heat.  Tasty, but definitely needed more of a kick.  Though we hardly ever order appetizers, I might have gone for the guacamole, but my chosen entree came with some, so we just forged ahead with the entrees.  We had decided to go with the Chicken in Mole and Carne Asada, and split both of them.  The Mole was delicious - rich, dark and spicy, but not as picante as most (which I usually find a bit TOO hot), so it was perfect.  The Carne Asada was a huge disappointment:  it was tough and lacking in flavor.  I sent it back - no problem! - and got Chicken Ranchero instead.  That was delicious.  Both platters came with rice, no-lard refried beans, and a bit of salad.  My original dish had pink beans, the mole black, but when I changed my dish I asked for the black beans. Alas, I lost my guacamole when I returned the carne asada :(.  The service was excellent, the ambience was enticing, and the food, other than the carne, was terrific.  We liked it a lot.  And we *will* go back!",

This is a family owned restaurant. The guacamole is made fresh. If you like it hot/spicy ask for their habanero salsa. Frank still grows the peppers himself.  The beers are really cold & the margaritas are really good!!",

Just wish the tortillas were homemade. And the carne wasn't over cooked. Overall not bad. The wait staff was excellent, everyone is very friendly.",

The restaurant is a lot larger than I was expecting based on the exterior appearance. We were seated quickly and they brought out chips and salsa. The salsa had a nice kick but the chips weren't my favorite.  I decided on the panuchos and the waiter claimed they were his favorite menu item and I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't. They were very good, everything was cooked well and the pickled cabbage added a great flavor to the dish. I also ordered a tamarind margarita and it was great. Just the right combination of flavors and we had a very pleasant meal.",

I'm taking one star off for slow, slow service and the \"meh\" margarita. Maybe it was my fault for not upgrading to the Cadillac margarita, but I thought the house would do the trick. It was blended well, don't get me wrong, I appreciate the vitamix type blend job... But alcohol and flavor were lacking.  Now... Food was on point. I thoroughly enjoyed my mole enchiladas. That sauce was as authentic as I've ever had (I'm not Mexican or an expert, but it was darn tasty.) The beans come on a little tostada cup and the rice tasted fresh. Can't remember what my boyfriend had, but he ate the whole thing. Something with green sauce...  Chips were crunchy and not too fragile or greasy. I could eat chips and salsa all day. Our salsa was spicy and I guess I wasn't expecting it because other places had been so bland; it was yummy though!  Will definitely return in the future.",

    "text": "I read the reviews on here and everyone had good things to say so we decided to try this place since it's only a few minutes up the street.  We walk in and it's a very nice simple family looking small mexican restaurant.  It wasn't very busy at all.  We got sat, and someone immediately took our drink order and brought our drinks right away, we received chips and salsa immediately and ordered a small side of quacamole (which was brought out in less then a minute) and had our dinner order taken very quickly.  Everything was fast and great so far.  We received our dinners for the 3 of us in probably 5-7 minutes.  I ordered the enchilada with mole sauce (which was VERY good), my dad ordered the seafood shrimp and crab enchiladas which was rich but very yummy.  Prices were very good too on their menu. Pretty much most of their dinners were right around the $10 range. So for everything I mentioned so far, I'd give this place 4 stars maybe even 5 stars.  But suddenly things completely changed after we received our entrees, (remember the restaurant was not busy at all that night and I think there were only 5 or so other tables dining at the same time as we were)    So after we received our entrees NO server ever came back to the table, our glasses were completely empty, we couldn't even flag someone down til we were completely done.  We finally got a server to refill our drinks.  He then asked us if we wanted dessert. Dessert seemed a bit pricey and everything was $4.50 (almost half the price of the dinner)  So we decided to get a flan and an order of churros (you had a choice of what kind of filling you wanted too.  The choices were cream, chocolate or strawberry) So we chose the cream.  When it came out, it was a small slice of flan and 1 small churro approx 2 - 3 inches in length and a scoop of ice cream FOR $4.25  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!  So ok we know next time just stick with dinner and no dessert.  So again we are waiting and waiting and NO server, no anybody to come give us our check.  after 5-7 minutes we finally get our check, and we immediately give him our card to pay.  I want you to keep in mind that again this is a small place and we are sitting right next to a small wall divider by the side station where they get drinks and the open kitchen where they are picking up all the food orders.    After 10 minutes of waiting for our card to be returned, I finally stood up and waived to our server over the wall into the side station and motioned for her to give us our card back so we can pay and leave.  She acknowledged me and then went to the table next to us to greet them and get their drink order. She did not have our card on her and never said anything to us. After another 5 minutes we asked someone else and he finally brought it to us.  I made it very clear to him that dinner was great everything was fast and then the service was horrible and we have literally been starting at the table/wall for 15 minutes just waiting to pay and leave and that is unacceptable.    So... 4 or 5 stars for food and the speedy service to start with 1 star for the lack of service after our food arrives for an avg of 3 stars.    Would I go back again??? YES... dinner and the prices are good, I would never order dessert again and I will not tolerate that slow of poor service after the entrees a 2nd time in a row (there was absolutely no reason for it)",

This time I ordered the steak tampiquena (steak with green peppers & onions and a cheese enchilada and tortillas) $12.95 and the bf ordered a carnitas burrito. The waitress did ask if he wanted anything else in the burrito because it is only a meat burrito with rice/beans/lettuce on the side. $7.50  We also ordered a side of guacamole $3.25, shouldn't have ordered this because my dish came with some.    The food came within 10 mins. My steak dish (medium) was surrounded with enchilada sauce but it didn't matter to me. Also there was a HUGH amount of sour cream.  Other than that everything was yummy! As usual the carnitas were excellent.  However after the food arrived the waitress never came back once to re-fill our water.  That is probably why they aren't getting 5 stars from us.  We have been here many times before and they always took care of us.    Usual we order the charbroiled chicken and the carnitas platter.  Those are both very good!",

    "text": "Chips & salsa were ok, nothing spectacular. I wanted a burrito a la carte and our waitress told us it was the same price as a \"meal\", no discount. Every Mexican joint I've ever been to has an a la carte menu, apparently they didn't get the news. I had the carne asada burrito and the meat was way over salted. I also found a small bone in my meat and almost cracked a frickin' tooth, no good. My hunny had some vegetarian enchiladas that she liked but they didn't really stand out amongst the competition. Service was pretty lame, our waitress never checked on us once throughout our meal which is unacceptable in my opinion. I don't think we'll be going back here.",

    "text": "Have been eating here for years and they sometimes have better than average Mexican food. Unfortunately, the food is often very inconsistent. They have excellent chips and salsa, and pretty good enchiladas. They're stingy with the meatballs in the albondigas, and I was pretty ticked off one time a while back at how much they charged me for an extra plate to split an entree with my Mom. So I'll probably continue to eat here on occasion, especially since it's SO close to my house and they do have really good chips and salsa... I just wish their other entree's were consistently good so I could venture out and order something other than the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. IE: last time I had ordered Enchilada Suizas the green sauce had a really bitter, funny taste to it. I know it's been good in the past... so..? Another example, my Mom had a chicken special the very first time I took her there that was recommended by Frank himself and ugh it really was terrible, really dry and borderline inedible. So, now I just order what I generally know I'll like and stick with that, and for that reason I'm sure I'll continue to eat here but also why I really can't rate it as high as I would like to, or what I think they could do if they had better quality control in their kitchen.",

The food sadly is mediocre and nothing to write home about. I was greatly dissapointed in the tortillas served with dinner. They were not homeade and tasted as though they were once frozen and re-warmed. The guacamole was bland and also a let down. The atmosphere was dark (a little too dark) with intimate seating arrangments. The children selections were non impressive either. We will not be returning. Pretty low on the authentic mexican food scale for me.",

Service was excellent, as the waitress filled our water glasses, beverages before the were empty, as well as the salsa and chips.  Salsa was good, with a roasted flavor and spicy!  We ordered the pork mole special, chicken mole enchiladas, sweet potato enchiladas and chicken enchiladas.  All had a side of rice, fried plantains, and refried beans in a molded tortilla shell.  The pork and chicken were both extremely tender and the mole was flavorful and tangy.  The sweet potato enchiladas were unique and had great flavor.  My only disappointment is that I haven't discovered this hidden gem sooner! Go!  You won't be disappointed!",

However, partner ordered a jamaica drink and his was perfectly fine. We also ordered the pinto bean dip and it was fine. The pico de gallo on top didn't really add anything in terms of flavor.   I ordered the carnitas plate (shredded pork, rice, beans) and my partner ordered the veggie taquitos with black beans. My dish didn't really blow me away, it tasted alright but nothing to gush about. My partner was impressed with his taquitos, which were stuffed with assorted veggies like sweet potatoes and zucchini. I tried a bite and it was indeed good.   This place could be improved, the rice tasted a bit bland and it's one of the few Mexican restaurants in town with vegetarian options. Service was good, our waiter was prompt and polite and our food came out super fast, although we did arrive two hours before closing and there wasn't any wait for tables.",

So I took her here hoping that she would like it as I saw they had a few dishes that looked authentic. It turned out she really enjoyed it! She was really surprised to see that they had some food from her area. She ordered the panuchos which of course I had to try and they were really awesome. I had the house special enchiladas with a verde sauce and crema and they were really delicious. I don't often order stuff with verde sauce as I prefer the red, but these really are special. The sides were all good and the prices right! Only little thing I'll mention on the downside is the lighting. I can't remember complaining about lighting before, but this place was definitely on the dark side. We sat in the middle which was kind of dark so I wanted to maybe move to a booth, but that was super dark so we stayed at our table. Certainly not enough to stop me from coming back, maybe next time we'll bring a candle. :)",

I don't like that fact that you get small scope of beans and rice in a tiny corn tortilla bowl.  I assume they do this because most poeple don't eat the beans and rice so it is more cost effective not to serve large amounts.",

We were seated and I've heard great things about the tamarind margaritas so we started with a round of that.  We were given chips and salsa and margaritas were served.  These tamarind margaritas were the best I've had.  I've had good margaritas and bad margaritas but this was my first tamarind margarita.  It was a perfect combination of sour, sweet and smokey.  I didn't know what to order for my entree so the server recommended the special of the day, chicken enchilada with creamy mushroom sauce.  I don't usually order enchiladas but I love mushrooms so I gave it a try.  When the food came out, my meal was delicious!  The creamy, rich mushroom sauce definitely made the meal and complimented everything else on the plate.  I will definitely come back for the drinks, food and friendly service.",

The chips needed salt, the salsa was thin but had good flavor.  It was a typical restaurant salsa.  The queso fundido was a large portion with lots of peppers on top.  It comes with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  It's a little difficult to get out of the bowl, we all had to use a knife, fork or our hands.  This can occur with this dish.  Despite the issues, it was a good version of queso fundido.  To eat, I had the Tampiquena, a thin ribeye steak COVERED in peppers and onions.  You can barely see the steak there is so much vegetation.  It is served with rice, beans, a cheese enchilada and your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  It's quite a lot of food for $13.95.  The steak is seasoned very well as are the vegetables.  I highly recommend taking some bites with the enchilada.  The steak is very thin, so I don't know that it can be cooked to medium rare, but even thought it was cooked more than I typically like, it was juicy.  This is a fantastic, and very filling meal, and one I will absolutely order again.  Service was attentive.  We had a nice long lunch and required lots of refills and they were brought promptly.  Also, we talked for a bit after we ate, and the staff never made us feel like we were overstaying our welcome.",

Stopping into this establishment was for sure worth it.  The atmosphere was great, a nice open floor setting with high ceilings that made the room feel very welcoming. The decor was very traditional and quite pleasant, not too distracting from the main attraction; obviously the delicious food.   I tried a combination platter, that of a chicken enchilada and a chicken tamal, and I was quite impressed! Unlike many restaurants that serve tamales, the Mesa didn't overpower the meat and was really quite scrumptious! The chicken used was delectable as well, perfectly seasoned and the rice and beans accompanying the platter were just as great!   The only downside to the trip was the service, while the  wait staff was sincerely accommodating and helpful, I felt that they were a little slow in helping our party of four. I will note that there were quite a few people in the restaurant, so I can understand why they may have been running a bit behind.   All in all, a wonderful authentic experience that I would definitely come back to!",

It's just a very nice atmosphere to have a reasonably priced delicious meal while experiencing excellent service.   It is locally owned and operated which makes my heart sing. When I say locally operated I mean it! Most likely it will be Frank taking your order and delivering your tasty meal. The service here is very family friendly. We have taken our daughter (11 months) and they were very complimentary and accommodating.   The food is very good! I absolutely love the sweet potato enchiladas. Also excellent are the chicken enchiladas and chicken tamale. I also really love the salsa here and have tried most of the starters. All yummy! You really can't go wrong!",

    "text": "Frank and Fina's Cocina has been my favorite restaurant since they were a quaint little place on Charleston. Now located in the southwest, it is the only place I will trek across town to dine on a regular basis.  One thing that makes this place outstanding is their accommodations for vegetarians. In addition to having an extensive vegetarian menu with everything from \"Build Your Own Entree\" (from a selection of tacos, tamales, and enchiladas) to SOYRIZO tacos, each day they have a new vegetarian special. If you ever see the Mexican Lasagna on the menu, get it! Think: enchiladas but with a more tomato based sauce and covered in mozzarella.  Also, I was pleased to see that their glorious sweet potato enchiladas (once a special item only) now have their own spot on the daily menu. Besides that, their complimentary chips and salsa (up to 2 per table, I believe) are always on point. Plus, as a self-proclaimed guacamole snob, I can say without a doubt that theirs is top notch--- chunky and fresh and delicious. While I'm usually too stuffed to even fathom dessert, I know they have several options, including a vegan cheesecake.  Another reason I adore this place is the service. I see the same crew nearly every time I go in (Frank himself often serving tables), and it helps make the place seem homey and comfortable, despite being a huge restaurant in a commercial area. One thing worth noting is that F&F's may not (easily) split your check if you're dining with a group, so be sure to plan in advance. Also, when they give you the check, I believe you need to walk it to the cashier by the door (rather than having your server pick it up/cash you out).  I can not rate this place higher and recommend it to everyone. It continues to be my favorite restaurant of all time, and I'll forever follow their delicious vegetarian-friendly delights.",

    "text": "The fiance had a conversation with his  coworkers about their favorite food spots and this came up a few times. I've heard of it, but we're not around this area often, but decided to head down. I've been looking for some new Mexican eateries.   The food is more Yucatan region judging from some of their menu offerings and the way they cook their staples. It's a bit different from what I'm used to, but I liked it.   I got a combo of chicken tamales and chicken enchiladas (which comes with red sauce but I asked for green) and the fiance got cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. The tamale was stuffed with chicken and had a tomato sauce over it. I think I prefer a bit more masa, but this was quality. Enchilada also was plentiful with chicken in it and I enjoyed their green sauce. The beans is more pureed than what I do and had a interesting roasty flavor about it. Rice was standard, but good.  The service was friendly and good. We both appreciated that we were able to sub minor things in our combo with no problems. We were checked on often and drinks were refilled.We came at not a busy time, and in the areas where people weren't sitting, some of the staff were doing some cleaning and prepping before dinner. Definitely appreciate a place that is cleaning daily.  I'll definitely be back. It's not the style of Mexican food I grew up with, but it's nice to shake it up sometimes. I'll try something that is more Yucatan like the panuchos next time.",

All dishes sampled were tasty and flavourful without being greasy.  On my last visit, I enjoyed the huevos and chorizo (scrambled eggs and sausage) immensely -- spicy, filling, and yummy.  Portions are generous and the chips and salsa appetizer (gratis) help to stave hunger pangs while waiting for your meal.  The salsa could be a little bit spicier, but it tasted fresh and tomato-y.    The decor has an intimate feel to it: dim lighting and understated wall art (nothing gaudy or over-the-top).  I would enjoy a dinner here on a date night.  :)",

Chips and salsa are good...but I mean how can any mexican restaurant get that part wrong right? I decided to get a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and a cup of fideo soup. The enchilada sauce was ok. Definitely have had better. The bean's and rice were flavored nicely.The soup lacked flavor and was oily. Not my favorite. I also got horchata ( I always have to order it at every mexican restaurant I go too) it was good but extremely sweet. Like it had either been sitting too long or hasn't been stirred. We shared fried ice cream. Which was also delicious no complaints there. Overall it was satisfying but probably not my top pick to come eat when I am craving mexican food.  The prices aren't bad eitheer and they have a nice selection for their lunch menu.",

Anyway, decided to ck out out Frank & Fina's for our burger craving, jus kidding I know Mexican .  I had the special which was choice of two tamales , I chose the colorado and the chix mole tamale. The colorado was good but the flavors of the chix mole drowned out the colorado tamale . The mole sauce was deeply flavored u could taste the chocolate.  I'm jus begining to appreciate mole, before could not stand it now that I know the skill and many ingredients that make a mole I'm a fan . I also had to try the sweet potato enchilada, based on other yelpers recomendations, and besides I  luv sweet potato . The idea is promising , I did not care for the red sauce , IMHO  it was better suited for a savory enchilada . I like sweet potato w/ vanilla sauce or a caramel sauce like other places serve their sweet potato fries .  I think it would b great with their chocolaty flavored mole sauce just drizzled, not drenched.   Chocolate and sweet potato , I think it would b a winner, maybe next time I'll ask, u should too ;). The plating was nice not just thrown on hap hazardly. Rice and beans were good not dry or crusty. Chips and salsa alright , nothing special . I don't know what took us so long to go back last time we went they were on charlston blvd, over 5 years ago, I promise we won't wait that long again .",

The food here is Tex-Mex, at best. You can expect to get blobs of sour cream and cheddar cheese to top your cumin-tasting \"Mexican\" rice. The salsas were watery and dumbed-down. Again, very inauthentic. I ordered Carne Asada tacos, which are difficult to mess up in most places (though this \"dish\" does not really exist in Mexico). The seasonings were off and the cheese was unnecessary. The Cochinita Pibil tacos were okay, which is why I am giving the place one star. The decor is as tacky as one would expect in Las Vegas, and the lighting is even annoying. I would never come back here. i would be better off eating at Roberto's Taco Shop! They are equally disgusting, though the latter is cheaper! However, if you are not looking for authentic Mexican food, but actually the dumbed-down, sour cream and cheddar topped version, you definitely will enjoy this place. The staff is also very friendly, which is why I am giving the place another star.",

Found F&F's on Yelp, tried it, and fell absolutely in love the first time. We eat here at least twice a month, sometimes more often. We've tried many different options, but consistently go back to the chicken enchiladas and tacos. Carnitas are tender and ultra flavorful. Chips are always fresh and warm, salsa is always amazing. They have a nice selection of wines and liquors, and while they don't have any kind of specialty bartender, the drinks are always great. Nothing fancy, just reliable. We take all of our out of town guests here, and they all rave about it. They have a few delicious vegetarian options, and their breakfast is great. We even had our rehearsal dinner here before our wedding.",

The servers were very polite, and maybe not too much on top of their game, but, very kind and sweet.   The chips were by far one of the best I've had in a while. The salsa is average, but with the habanero sauce mixed in, it made it amazing. I think that's the key, otherwise the salsa was lacking herbs, onions, and salt.   The cheese enchilada was amazing--the red sauce being the best I've had to date. I was quite blown away by it. I got the combo with the fried beef tacos. Will skip the fried tacos next time as the beef was a bit tough.   The grilled chicken plate was quite good...ours was slightly overcooked, but the flavors were there. Overall, I felt this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas. I shall go back and try more, as well as try see if they are consistent with the food. It will definitely hit the spot if you're craving for some good Mexican food. Try the cheese enchiladas!!!!! quite impressive sauce!",

I came with a couple of friends of mine on a lunch date. We were on a limited amount of time, but didn't even have to worry about it. Our food came out super fast super hot and the people are super friendly. I will come back here any chance I get. I can't wait to try something else on the menu!!!!",

Hubby had best enchilada chicken suizas ever! The sauce was tasty and flavorful. I had pork carnitas that must have been marinating for days. Succulent and complex flavors.   Good range of Mexican beers. Try their Tequila special - $7 for a shot of Herradura Silver. Put in on the rocks with a squeeze of lime. Big YUM!!  This us our new fav in Vegas for Mexican. Service was good but seemed just a little disorganized. Overall, I would accept with the high quality of food.",

I tend to not be the most available individual, but Robyn and Kevin L. have been very patient with me. After a few failed get together attempts, we finally met at Frank and Fina's for dinner.   I have had this on my bookmarks for a few months and was happy to try something new. Of course I fell victim to the infamous Sweet Potato Enchiladas ($10.25) and a Margarita on the rocks with salt ($5.75). Two nice size tortilla rolls filled with mashed sweet potatoes caught me off guard with the natural candy like flavor. After a few more bites, I adjusted, and they were delicious. I was also able to taste Robyn's Guacamole and Kevin's Queso Fundido. Both were good. The first might be bland for some, but I could eat a whole guacamole with nothing else, so that did not bother me. The cheese dip was fantastic. Served with soft flour tortillas, you will need more to get all of the melty goodness. It would be a sin to waste any,  If a good meal is not enough, bring some friends along because it is a chill atmosphere. Throughout dinner, we were checked upon, but it did not interfere with conversation. The quiet setting is perfect for dates or catching up.",

One of them even carried my runaway toddler back to the table after she had escaped from me for the fifth time.  When I mentioned to my friend that I was concerned about how I was going to carry my leftovers back to the car (they were in Styrofoam boxes), someone who overheard me from the other side of the wall came and brought me a plastic bag.  I really love going here, and I would especially recommend anyone with kids to visit.",

We have been going here since it was just a tiny little house on West Sahara and it has been great to see them move and expand.  The food and service is always amazing.  My wife likes the chimichanga and I usually get one of the combo platters.    I have actually ordered the salsa to go for parties and such at the house.  The atmosphere is great and inviting and the place is easy to get to right off of the 215.  By far our favorite mexican restaurant.",

I have to give Frank & Fina's an honorable \"Damn these are good Nachos!\" so why not 5 stars you ask? Well I will tell you.. price and portions. For the price of the nachos with grilled chicken I would expect a bigger portion size and more chicken.. a lot more chicken. So here is my recommendation to you the reader, order the grilled chicken nachos and ask them to make them enchilada style (I prefer the red sauce / you might like the green) they make a great appetizer among friends, if I am your friend then get your own damn nachos cuz this plate is mine!",

Im sorry but to think that the kitchen where our meals have been prepare might of came in contact with roaches is the reason it will be the last time we will be coming here.

We ordered: -Riesling -Empenadas -#4 combination (1 crispy beef taco, 1 enchilada, rice & beans) -Chicken mole enchiladas  It tasted very authentic and the pricing was moderate for standard fare Mexican food. The beef in the crispy taco, while flavorful, was slightly dry.  Service was very good, multiple waiters helped us and everyone was friendly.

    "text": "This place is WONDERFUL.   I sometimes hate how gaudy Mexican restaurants can be in Vegas. When you walk into F&F's, you know you're in a Mexican restaurant, but it's cute and classy and definitely not over the top. The lighting is dim and it does not feel like every other Mexican restaurant in town. It's really cute inside! I love the vibe and the way the restaurant is set up.    The menu is laid out in a very \"American-friendly\" way in that the dishes are explained well for those of us who may not know what things are or what the Spanish words for certain dishes mean. That is a huge plus for me!   Within two minutes of being seated, chips and salsa were brought to our table. That is an immediate star. I didn't even have to ask. Also, our drinks were never empty and they came within 30 seconds of ordering. We also ordered bean dip and it was delivered within a few minutes. It was as good as any other bean dip I've had at any other Mexican restaurant, but it came with pico de gallo on top, which was also a plus.   I was flustered and couldn't decide what to order (this happens to me constantly) so I just ordered two tacos - one crispy chicken and one pork adobada with rice and beans. My gf ordered the fajitas. Our food came out within 15 minutes, or at least that's what it seemed like. My gf and I are \"talkers\" so time almost always goes by quickly when we are dining.   Now, this review may be a bit biased because it was about 8pm and it was the first meal we had eaten all day. We partied pretty hard on Saturday and basically slept all day on Sunday... so we were starving. BUT, my tacos were DELICIOUS. The crispy chicken was juicy and the pork adobada sauce was tasty and not overpowering. There wasn't too much sauce, which I love. Now, these were not as great as the tacos at Tacos Al Gordo, but they was close enough for me! I definitely recommend trying the crispy chicken tacos - YUM.   My gf seemed to really enjoy  her fajitas too! And the prices were extremely reasonable and actually cheaper than most upscale Mexican restaurants I have been to.    As far as food goes, I think this place deserves about 4 stars. However, because the service was so wonderful (we must have had about 3 different people taking care of us) and the ambiance was perfect, I have to give 5 stars.   This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant! CHECK IT OUT.  Next time, I'm trying the sweet potato enchiladas! :)",

Having never heard of Frank and Fina's previously I had no expectations going in.  I leave feeling full but not fully satisfied.  To start, the chips and salsa were alright.  Crisp chips and generic salsa that tastes more of tomato than anything else.  Sure, I ate it by the bowl full but that does not mean it was an outstanding example of what can be a magical accomaniment to a chip.  For dinner I ordered a classic two item combo with a taco and tamale and the obligitory rice and beans.  The rice was good and the beans were refried.  I much prefer black beans to refried pintos but that is just me.  The taco I had was ipressive loaded with flavorful and tender meat.  It dripped half way down my arm towards my elbow.  That is the measure of a good taco.  As for the tamale, the flavor was alright and the ratio of meat to maza was fine.  it was the texture that threw me.  The maza was too smooth and seemed over processed.  I am used to a grittier form of maza.  I guess this isn't my favorite place to get Mexican food.",

We sat there about ten minutes with no contact from anyone until the busser brought us a bowl of chips and salsa.  Can I just say that the salsa did not taste fresh nor unique.  Well had to wait another ten minutes while we watched the busser clean two table before even asking us for a drink order.  Now we wait for at least 15 more minutes, to the point we almost got up and left but we were hungry.  The older gentleman, that was our waiter, sneaked up and just asked \"what can i get you\"?  Didn't even introduce him self nor recommended anything.  The food was well BLAH.  My taco was soggy on the bottom and all the filling fell out.  The enchilada was hard to eat due to the over cooked shredded beef.  Well here is where they really messed up.  We sat there with our napkins on our plates for at least 15 min before being presented with the check, from the hostess.  Now we got up to go pay for the meal and the waiter had the audacity to stop my wife and ask her if he can help her with anything insinuating that we were trying to walk out on the bill.  Dude I had the check in my hand.  Even worse he began talking Spanish to the hostess saying \"I thought they were trying to leave\", once again Dude I speak fluent Spanish.  I can defiantly say we will never be back to this run down, want-to-be Mexican restaurant.  Lo siento pero nunca voy a regresar.",

    "text": "My husband and I, along with our closest friends, are addicted to Mexican food so I got excited when I found this place on Yelp with great reviews. We live close by but always assumed it was an Italian restaurant from the name. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype of the Yelp reviews.  Pros: the salsa, bean dip, and margaritas were good. Also, one of my friends enjoyed his meal, but I don't remember what he got, most likely carnitas. Cons:  1) the queso fundido had NO TASTE, we spent a little more to have chorizo added and there were only two tiny dollops, absolutely not worth the upgrade money spent and the cheese had ZERO flavor.  2) my beef enchilada had a weird taste to it and I wound up only having like three bites because I did not enjoy it at all. My chicken taco was just okay, nothing special, but not bad at all. 3) the rest of the group ordered a quesadilla, taquitos, and a charbroiled chicken dish. All of those were just okay.  Basically we spent a fair amount of time vocally wishing we had gone to Juan's Flaming Fajitas, which is our favorite place. FYI, the queso fundido with chorizo at Juan's is phenomenal. I was hoping Frank & Fina's would become one of our regular spots, but we will probably never go here again since 4 out of 5 of us didn't enjoy it.",

It comes out so fast that I have waited longer for a mediocre fast food burger than I have for excellent quality Mexican food. Sometimes, I wish the food did not come out so fast, because the salsa and guacamole are as good as it gets for me and my friends and family!   Priscilla and Adrian are tremendous, they are not only great people, but they work hard and their parents (Frank and Fina) should be tremendously proud of the work they put in to make their cocina my favorite Mexican cocina. It is worth the trip from any place in the valley. It will beat almost any place on the Strip and is way more affordable.",

    "text": "This place is awesome! Came here with a girlfriend late afternoon for some margs and Mexican food!   I've always seen this place since I'm always at the Target right by there, and had no idea it was a Mexican restaurant. The interior is incredible and rustic.  I ordered a chicken tamale and chicken enchilada. They were cooked to perfection and the portion size was unbelievable. I had to take half of it to go since I was so full. Even with the free chips and salsa appetizer, I had no more room. My skinny margaritas were perfect. On the rocks and with a salted rim. It was to die for and priced perfectly.  When the bill came, I was shocked how inexpensive it was! Two margs and a two combo plate for less than 30$. Our service was incredible, and so was the food. Thanks guys for keeping my wallet happy and my stomach full!",

We had not interest in eating, we just wanted a couple of drinks.   I find this very odd. Who does this? I have lived in this town for over 37 years and have never been to a place where we couldn't go and have a drink. This is Vegas for pete sake.   They said if we were seated and ordered drinks we would have to pay for the chips and salsa. We didn't want to eat anything. We would probably have spent more money on drinks than food. Oh well.   Thanks for Lindo Michochan down the street.",

What I like most about Frank and Fina's is their unique style of Mexican and Central America food. Not authentic, but tasty indeed. I had the chicken enchiladas,Suizas. And my hubby had an al pastor burrito. The al pastor was too sweet unfortunately , almost  like BBQ flavor. Not quite what he was expecting. But I loved my enchiladas made with mozzarella cheese, a little far from traditional style but still good. The sauce, rice and beans were decent as well. I tried their organic lime margarita on the rocks( of course)and it wasn't bad. I would have preferred that they didn't use a pre-made mix but oh well   The service was a little slow at the end of our meal, but the waiter was nice and we got our meals 8-minuets after ordering so that was a plus. Not a very intimate setting, but overall ok. I definitely want to try this place again and try something else :)",

I'm always down to try something new or different.  *Shrimp Tacos* The two tacos were good sized tacos and they were generous with the shrimp. You have your choice of corn of flour tortilla. It came with some lime, refried beans, and rice. Good stuff!  We got good service even though we came in for a late lunch. The place was practically empty by the time we were finished with our meal. Based on this visit, I would definitely give this place another visit in the future. There were other menu items that I would like to try.",

    "text": "This has been my go to spot for Mexican food for about two years. I was initially brought to Frank and Fina's by a guy I was seeing and although the relationship didn't work out, I always felt that I gained something since I FINALLY found authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. As a LV transplant from Southern California, I definitely am used to some of the best Mexican food outside of, well, Mexico.  The best part about this lovely spot is that it's family owned and they are always very warm and welcoming. Each and every time I return I feel as though they're genuinely happy to see me come back. In addition, the restaurant is familiar with cooking for vegetarian/vegan guests and has a whole section of meat-free offerings. My personal favorite are the sweet potato and soyrizo tacos. They're incredibly good (especially with the homemade tomatillo salsa).   Unfortunately, I will say that the food is rather inconsistent. On several occasions I have had to send my food back to be remade because it was extremely over cooked/burned and when I have ordered other dishes, I have found them to be VERY bland/under-seasoned. My mom has also had the vegetarian special a few times and has been quite underwhelmed.  Because my overall experience at Frank and Fina's has generally been quite positive, I feel that four stars is pretty on point. Unfortunately, when my food has been bland or significantly over cooked, I would say a lower rating would be more accurate. Give this lovely place a try, I would just suggest sticking with a personal favorite versus a daily special (since they're very, very bland).",

From the authentic Southwest ambience which is warm and comfortable to the last drop of delicious food cleared off your plate, every moment will be savored. I wish they bottled their sauces, the salsa alone is incredible. Tonight I had the burrito served enchilada style with wonderful flavored red sauce. Both the seasoned beef and the sauce were homemade deliciousness. The dishes served are family recipes brought from the Yucatan to Las Vegas by the owners. This puts each meal a grade above your typical Mexican restaurant. So good. All meals are superb and we have dined here for many years, craving to go back every time. The staff are friendly and treat you like royalty with exceptional service.",

Located at the same spot since 2008, a fairly remarkable accomplishment in a city where the dining landscape sees openings and closings almost daily both on-Strip and off, Frank & Fina's is one of those rare places in Las Vegas that has sustained the test of time despite minimal advertising and little media mention, the patrons on this particularly afternoon almost universally Caucasian and obviously regulars with an average age North of fifty despite two well-behaved children dragging that number down.  In some ways a 'theme' restaurant, the decor intentionally transportive with overhead music ethnically appropriate and items such as a Tequila Bottle shaped pinata hanging not far from a painting of Frida Kahlo, diners at Frank & Fina's Cocina are greeted from a small hostess stand labeled \"Que Pasa?\" on entry, the tables filling two rooms and the Menu totaling five pages plus a handful of daily specials.  Named after its ownership and offering a typical American-Mexican menu, the obligatory basket of Chips and mild Tomato Salsa fairly forgettable though the Tortillas are served warm, it was after perusing a predictable list of Enchiladas, Tacos and Fajitas that eyes landed on some items that stood out as somewhat unique, the Appetizer quickly up-sold by a pleasant young Mexican waiter who did a great job covering a lot of real estate as he appeared to be the only employee working the room.  Fairly quick in terms of service, an okay to serve both Appetizer and Entree at the same time seeing merely ten minutes between placing an order and receiving Food, it was after briefly surveying the landscape that a Chip was used to scoop up some of the Queso Fundido that had already started to turn somewhat rubbery, the $2 addition of \"Chorizo\" no more than a tablespoon and certainly not spicy with a taste and texture not unlike ground Beef.  Off to a fairly inauspicious start, the $9 plate similar to what one might pay in a Casino for something better, it was onto warm Flour Tortillas that additional Cheese was scooped along with flaccid Peppers before moving on to a combination plate of standard-issue Beans and Rice plus two Tamales, the Chile Colorado Beef featuring shredded Meat actually quite good while the \"Chicken Mole\" ordered was inexplicably covered with a sour green Salsa that made one wonder whether the server instead wrote down \"Chile Verde Pork\" or if the kitchen accidentally added the wrong Sauce to the flavorless cubes of Meat inside a steamy roll of Corn.  Holding out hope for Dessert, $4.95 for one room-temperature Churro broken in half and piped with Caramel both ridiculously priced and fairly underwhelming next to store-bought Vanilla Ice Cream, it was at an even more eyebrow raising $6.95 that a thin wedge of \"Tres Leches Cheesecake\" from the Specials board was offered, the sponge moist but not 'wet' while the center was more firm than creamy, as though it was nothing more than Cream Cheese with a little bit of Sugar mixed in.  **Offering pleasant service and a comfortable setting, the ownership and staff both doing their best to create a family-friendly environment harkening something one might find The Mission or in a small Mexican community in Phoenix, Frank & Fina's unfortunately lacks in terms of quality and execution with dishes that do not fit the price point.",

I ate my dinner that evening, taco salad and a side of beans, no prob. The next day I was eating the lunch portion - just the beans. I was just finishing the cup and of course took the final bite, when all of a sudden I bit into something solid. I spit it out and was surprised - I was staring at a small metallic ball!!  I scraped around and found a SECOND small metallic ball!!!  I immediately called Frank & Finas and asked for a manager. I was told there wasn't one on site so I explained the situation to the person answering the phone. They put me on hold and then Fina picked up. Her response astounsed me:  \"well, you should have kept it..  What do you want me to do?\"  I informed her that I DID keep it and would be bringing it to her after work. When I got there the hostess had pulled my receipt from the night before and asked if I wanted a Gift Card or my cash back.... Ummm, I really just want to know what the heck I put in my mouth and how the heck it got there. Ultimately, I settled for my money back with no explanation and not even an apology from the owner.  My suggestion for the owners and management of this establishment is to take a course in customer service. A simple explanation and apology would have went a really long way here!",

Comfortable, neighborhood atmosphere with a relaxed, unhurried pace. My favorites are the carnitas which are fantastic on their own or in other dishes, the taco salads and the tamarind margaritas. Most of the staff have been there for a long time which is a testament to the ownership and means they know what they're doing. It's definitely family friendly and it's easy to find simple dishes but there are also plenty of authentic things to try and new specials frequently. Like I said I've been going often for a long time and never been disappointed.",

The Ambience is amazing and makes you feel like you are in a Cantina in Mexico. And you will absolutely love their delicious and exotic Margarita selection. I started out with a blended mango margarita and was eventually steered by our awesome and extremely friendly waiter to walk on the wild side and try their jalapeno margarita which was fabulous. As for their food it was not only delicious and authentic but beautiful in presentation and extremely fresh. I highly recommend their homemade guacamole it was some of the tastiest I have ever had. Our awesome waiter recommended the special a fajita bomba which my wife had and it was amazing topped with guacamole , and sour creme. I had the enchilada suizas   And they were some of the best I ever had. My daughter had the carne asada steak and they marinate it something that makes it taste like heaven. For desert I was recommended to try their homemade orange and cream cheese flan and it was absolute heaven. We found our place and I will be returning next week to bring my mother in law here for her birthday. I highly recommend this place if you are a lover of Mexican food.b",

My wife ordered the sweet potato enchiladas. That was also pretty good. I was afraid I wouldn't like it 'cause I don't like sweets. However, it was just a very muted sweet.  To cap off our dinner we shared the coconut flan. It was quite good, and my wife continues to contend that Frank & Fina's Cocina has the best flan out there.",

    "text": "Met a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out with Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.  While I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.  We had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.  The Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOL  We had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.  Overall it was a good time.  Will I return?  Of course!",

The ambience is also not bad either!  Very clean and homey feeling and prices are reasonable in my opinion.  If you're watching what you eat, the roasted chicken with tortillas on the side is a good option (think El Pollo Loco, but better).  I think I got two pieces one time and it was huge.    A favorite of ours is the carne asada torta.  Awesome!  The bread is nicely toasted and the guacamole is abundant.  Their meats are good too.  My kind of torta!  The burrito is also good - be sure to get it enchilada style.  The complimentary fresh chips and salsa is also a nice touch.  This Mexican fare is simple, but delicious.  That coupled with good prices and a nice environment makes this a place we will visit again and again.",

I don't know why they bother with menus because everything they serve is golden. Today we got one of the house specialties, chicken mole enchiladas, and a delicious shrimp dish cooked with pineapple.  The staff is always personable and helpful explaining the dishes. It's located in an easy-to-get-to shopping area in Summerlin. Lots of parking, no hassle finding it. So classic Vegas? Been there, done that. Now we relax with this wonderful Yucatan restaurant, another restaurant here in Summerlin (Lola's), and beautiful drives through Red Rock Canyon, also near Summerlin. A trip here should be relaxing, not frenetic. No better way to start that process than at Frank and Fina's. I promise you'll rave about the unbelievably delicious food.",

There are so few in Las Vegas that I feel are high quality that I was hoping to find one and Frank & Fina's.   We arrived on a Sunday around 430PM and there was 1 other table, so there was not a lot of customers but there were several staff. The staff were very attentive and kept the drinks filled. The restaurant and restrooms were clean.  The food was terrible. None of the food had seasoning or flavor and did not meet quality expectations. I personally ordered the Charbroiled Chicken and it tasted chewy and like it had been heated up in the microwave. The carne asada fries had low quality frozen fries and ended up not tasting very good, maybe old meat? My daughter ordered the quesadilla and ate half of it and said it was \"ok\". None of my family was impressed with the food and we were avid fans of Leticia's before they closed their locations and moved into the SantaFe.  Unfortunately we were surprised by this venue having a solid 4 stars when the food is not even good at best.  Friendly service, but the food falls flat.",

We had a larger party this trip, so we had a lot more food! Hubby had steak fajitas- crisp, deliciously sizzling veggies, melt-in-your-mouth steak, huge helping of cheese, sour cream, guacamole too! Chicken - marinated in fruit juices, this chicken is tender, juicy, delicious! Chicken taquitos-these are HUGE! Drenched in guacamole, sour cream & cheese, the appetizer gets you four giant taquitos! Tamales & mole with \"the best mole sauce I've had in a while!\" Enchiladas, swimming in delicious red sauce, again not too spicy and covered in cheese with sour cream and guacamole. And of course, my favorite- fajitas bomba-chicken, mushrooms, veggies, cheese, covered in sour cream and guacamole and served with rice and beans. Btw-the beans here are the best I've had in Vegas, ever.   Wait staff is still fantastic. Service with smiles and quick! Never asked for a water refill, margaritas were frosty delish!   They do not nickel and dime - generous portions of good tasting, authentic-y food!",

Tables pushed into ever possible nook, lots of noise, no privacy. Felt a lot like steerage crammed into a feeding stall.  The bad:  No bar.  They do sell adult beverages, but they insist in you ordering food and will offer up the suggestive selling of:  Buy chips & Salsa & you can hVe. Beer.   No outdoor seating,  and one private bathroom per gender.    I never knew our waiter, as we had 4 separate people serving us, this took away from any type of personalization.   Tip:  So NOT bring small children.  The tables being crammed together leaves for unattended and ill mannered children to stick there fingers in peoples plates, and when they trip and fall they will smack there face into chairs & table corners.",

Not sure that it was made in house- but I'll do my best next time to get the Guacamole. The desserts also caught my eye. If you've read my other reviews you'd know I consider myself a nacho connoisseur of sorts. Chips were fresh- not stale- which just Ruins a nacho plate. Plate was burning hot so I know it was fresh from the oven. Salsa and guacamole were both good. And the carne Asada was on point-  I'll certainly be back- OH! The host and Wait staff are Superb!! This really makes a good business in my mind - and I saw at least three young families here- so they're good with babies in children seat and cradles!",

I don't think I've ever ordered anything I didn't like.   They start you off with chips and salsa. The salsa is very tasty and not spicy at all. I always have to stop myself from getting full before my main dish comes out. This last time we went I ordered the green chilaquiles with chicken and added two eggs on top. They were perfectly tangy and rather spicy. My husband ordered the carnitas plate, and that's what I'll be ordering next time we go! I also had a blended house margarita and enjoyed it.   The atmosphere is rather nice at Frank and Fina's. The lights are dim and the music is at a perfect volume. My husband and I will continue to come and enjoy the delicious Mexican food and margaritas!",

This is the 2nd time in a row that the order was incomplete and we had to wait almost a full extra hour for the remainder to be delivered. When you're ordering for two people and one persons food does not arrive, No one eats. So now the food that was delivered first sits to become cold and soggy.   Then I bite into my quesadilla and pulled this long 2 1/4\" black hair out of my mouth. I do not have black hair, I have bright pink hair and no one else opened my food but me.

They knew there was vomit all over the floor and they still sat us there. Then they proceeded to argue with me about it. Too the point it got really nasty and they were even cursing...at me! Who the f*** wants to sit next to vomit while eating? Why does that question even need to be asked? So they're on the brink of losing their restaurant? Good.

I loved all the comments & can't wait to try the items you don't find at other Mexican restaurants. I ordered my usual, a chili relleno and a pork/carnitas taco and it was by far the best tasting pork I have had in a long time! My son ordered the steak fajitas & they were amazing too. I tried a piece of the steak that basically melted in my mouth! The flavor & the tenderness was amazing! I am always amused when people complain about the salsa & chips because that is one item that I find to be so different in every Mexican restaurant! I have friends that love the really thick chips and I love the super thin. I don't like a salsa too spicy but then most people like it really hot. I just have never gone to a Mexican restaurant because of it's chips & salsa. It's almost better when I don't like those because I don't fill up on them & become too stuffed when my main entree comes! The service was great too! That can make me not return! Being I was a food & cocktail waitress for many years I expect good service but at the same time I know what they go through so I have extra patience for certain things but friendliness is a must! I will definitely be back!!!",

Ordered chicken fajitas for 2 and it wasn't worth one and it was $26!!! The chicken had lots of gristle. 4 x more veggies than chicken. Margarita was SMALL and totally not worth $11. There will not be a 2nd chance.",

Turns out the food is very good, among the best Mexican I've had in Vegas (and I've been searching for good Mexican restaurants here for nearly 3 years!). I've been several times now, and the service can be spotty, but everyone is always friendly.  I wish they stayed open a bit later, but I suppose the area doesn't support many late night restaurants. :)  Overall, Frank & Fina's has become my \"go-to\" place for Mexican food. The atmosphere and friendliness are good, and the food has been consistently pretty good. The chips and salsa are great by the way! Price-wise, they are about typical for mid-range Mexican food.  If you haven't tried this place, definitely give it a shot!",

My gf doesn't usually like Mexican food, but both she and I walked out saying we'd surely be back.  The best point here is the service.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the service is terrific.  The hostess and servers are all very personable.  And if it's their table or not, all servers are looking around the entire restaurant to see that everyone is happy.  Can someone teach other restaurants this simple lesson?    Food:  My gf really enjoyed her shrimp, in a very tasty sauce (I don't know which), and a big enough serving to provide leftovers.  I had the Huevos Rancheros, which are among the best I've had in Vegas.  Everywhere I go, I try the Rancheros and am typically disappointed.  It's become a running joke with my friends and me.  So when the waitress recommended it, we laughed, but she persisted.  Thank you!    The waitress also recommended the sweet potato enchilada - delicious!  Not too heavy, and not too cheesy/saucy.  They've nailed this dish perfectly.    My gf loved the flan, but I thought it was a bit too dense.    Summary, this is a solid place to eat, with very reasonable prices.  This goes in our regular rotation.",

They weren't the transcendent culinary experience I expected, but they were tasty. It's basically just mashed sweet potatoes in a tortilla and topped with red sauce, cheese and sour cream. They weren't too sweet and the sauce added a delicious blend of spices to it. The dish came with rice and black beans. It wasn't a cheap lunch ($11), but it was good.  The service was ridiculously quick. I probably waited around 5 minutes after ordering before the food came out. So, if you're looking for a quick spot for a sit-down lunch head over here.",

My kids, like most little ones, we're fighting over who got to sit by grandma. We asked the owner if we could have the bigger table so that both could sit by grandma. He answered \"why? What's wrong with this table?. We need that table for larger parties.\". We both looked around and said \"oh because you are so busy?!\". Needless to say he wouldn't move us and not one other table came in while we were there!!!! REALLY?!!!!!!!! Wow! Lol.  On another note the food was great. I later called to speak to him and once again he was rude and Truely believed he was right.

While pissing everyone behind us off driving down West Charleston at 25 mph trying to read every restaurant sign looking for someplace to fill our requirements, I finally saw this free-standing little place and we promptly u-turned and headed back.  Inside was a cozy little place, well-cooled and comfortable.  Our waiter (I'm assuming Frank) came over with chips, salsa, and menus right away.  A+ on the chips and salsa.  An extensive menu (with all-day breakfast... which won Megans heart immediately) made our mouths start watering.  After waffling back and forth over the seemingly better and better choices, Megan finally settled on chicken soup & ropa vieja & I got the al pastor.  We also ordered some guacamole &, of course, margaritas to pass the time.  The guac & soup came out with some supplemental chips and damn were they tasty. Megans soup had large chunks of vegetables floating in it, and our waiter was happy to identify them all for us.  The guacamole was creamy and fresh and hit the spot after a day of dragging 30 lbs of gear through hot canyons.  Our plates came out shortly after... the ropa vieja was juicy as promised, and the al pastor had a great bite to it that really lingered on  the palate.  Frank & Fina's is now our de facto mexican go to place in Vegas.  It's close to the scenic loop in Red Rock Canyon, and still way off the strip.  We're looking forward to our next climbing trip so we can kick back at a more leisurely pace here (we were on our way to the airport after the meal) and really take our time enjoying a great meal in a very  friendly & inviting location.",

The food is authentic Mexican - no one at our table had even the slightest criticism about their meal, which almost never happens.

Everything I've tried has been wonderful, my favs. are enchiladas, beans & the breakfast plates. I always bring family/friends from out of town here & they all ask to come back when they visit.",

I was told it would be 20 minutes and when I showed up after more than 20 minutes I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my order. The restaurant was not that busy. When I got home with my order they forgot my flan. I went back to the restaurant and the hostess knew exactly why I was there because she forgot the flan. I had to wait an additional 10 minutes while she seated another party and assisted another party with paying for their meal until I got the flan that she forgot. All I received was an apology and nothing else. No offer of a discount on my next visit or a discount on my order that I had placed. When I finally got home to enjoy my meal, it was mediocre at best. The mole was bland and anything less than good. it barely tasted like mole and more like thick gravy. The beans and rice we're nothing special and tasted like your run-of-the-mill Mexican fare. The best part was the pico de Gayo and cilantro. That was at least fresh and had the most flavor. Highly disappointed with my experience and not sure that I will ever return. Far better choices for Mexican food in the SW area. Additionally it was overpriced for what I received.",

But tonight I came back because I was curious about the sweet potato enchiladas.    Wow, it was packed tonight.  We waiting 25 minutes for food and another 15 minutes before they took our order.  I ordered the sweet potato enchiladas and my hubby ordered the carnitas.   The sweet potato enchiladas were good but not out of this world great.  It must be all the vegetarians giving the great reviews for the sweet potato enchiladas. Don't get me wrong I love vegetarian food but this dish doesn't make me have that \"ah\" moment and \"OMG\" this so the best thing ever.    I would not order it again.  I would however order the carnitas.  I did my ninja move and sneak a fork full of yum yum roast pork from hubby's plate.  The pork was excellent.  It was tender and tasty.  I had some sour cream and salsa with the meat and made it into a 4 star dish.    Con-  My hubby thought the portion size was too small but I disagree.  It was perfect for me.",

    "text": "Went here for Cinco de Mayo dinner.  Hostess told us the wait was about 45 minutes and I think we were seating in a little less than that.  However watching the bus staff, they definitely could have been a little quicker in turning over the tables.  They also don't have a bar to sit in while you wait; just a couple small benches at the entrance.  The atmosphere is nice and has a nice cantina feel to it.  Once we were seating, they brought the free chips and salsa immediately.  Guacamole is extra and was good (chunky and not watered down like a previous reviewer's was, so it may be hit or miss).  The owner roams around the restraurant and he brought us our food no more than 5 minutes after we ordered, as we simply ordered burritos and tacos.  I got the carne asada burrito enchilada style for around 10 bucks, and it was very good.  The best deal may be the tacos (2 a la carte for about $6).  The weak point at this place was the service.  After we got our food, our waiter all but disappeared  for at least a half an hour, leaving me wanting another margarita but not getting one.  Once they finally came around to take our plates away, I found myself thinking ahead \"do we want more chips? another taco?\" as I wasn't sure the next time we would get that chance.  A sign of poor service in my opinion.  Even as the place started to clear out and we were just sitting around talking, they didnt bring us our check until we were one of the last tables still there.  Overall, the food was tasty and I had an very enjoyable experience, mostly because of good company.  But I'm pretty sure we could of had that at a bunch of other places too.",

    "text": "After years of being a faithful and loyal customer to Frank and Fina's Cocina, I had quite the appalling experience here which was one of my favorite local Mexican restaurants. I recently went in to share a quick meal with my mother. As it was a last minute get-together, I had eaten an hour before. We agreed I would enjoy chips and salsa along with Frank and Fina's delicious homemade guacamole, and my mother would have an entree. A nice man came to take our order. I have been served by him many times and never had any problem. He has always been polite and offered top level service. We ordered some guacamole and my mother ordered her entree. I respectfully told him I had recently eaten and was just going to snack on the appetizer while my mother had a full meal. He pressed me a little like any good salesman; offered me an ala carte enchilada. I expressed that it was tempting, but no thank you. He then told me that if we had the intention of sharing a plate that he would charge me an additional $3.00. While I found this a bit irritating, I obliged and said we would not be sharing and I would again, just be enjoying the appetizer. He put the order in and came back two minutes later. This time it got ridiculous. He asked me once more if I wanted to order an entree. I again said, \"no thank you.\" He then looked me in the eye and said, verbatim, \"if I see you touch her plate, I will charge you.\" I was appalled. Just when I thought he couldn't be any more condescending, he followed it up with, \"do you understand me?\" I was stunned. I asked for my check. I went to the counter to pay for my food. (The only thing we had at this point was the guacamole.) I asked the girl at the counter for his name. She told me he was the owner. I was in disbelief. I have never been treated so rudely. I have been coming to this establishment and singing its praises for over three years. This experience has ruined any chance of me or my family ever dining at this restaurant again. While I will admit that the food is good and usually the service is great, this encounter with the OWNER will never be forgotten.   My final thought is, \"what would Fina have to say about Frank's behavior?\"",

    "text": "I think I just found a legit, good Mexican cuisine restaurant in Vegas!   I first discovered this place when I was invited with my girlfriends family about a month ago April 2015. Once walking in, the thought ran into my head, \"this isn't going to be good.\" Call me picky, or whatever but Mexican cuisine restaurants in Vegas mostly miss the mark and taste bland. Sometimes I think they do it because it's easy, beans, rice and a burrito. Really?   I was recommend to try the chile relleno, something I wouldn't order normally, not because I don't like it more like there's other stuff that I like more. So took my girlfriends sisters recommendation and also heard it wasn't at all super spicy, and ordered the dish. My girlfriend (who cooks probably the best chicken enchiladas ever!) tried just that, chicken enchiladas with red sauce. She also tried something she normally wouldn't, and raved about how good it was. Had a taste, and indeed it was delicious. Nice balance of spice, not overpowering and the chicken was full of flavor. The rice, beans were also a nice addition since they somehow get it wrong at other restaurants.  Verdict, pretty good. The food tasted quite delicious and felt homemade. The chips with salsa aren't out of this world, but come on you have to have chips/salsa before your meal. I also added on the guacamole and if your sharing with say your friend or significant other, it'll do. It's good, not great, just nothing to complain.  The service was excellent. For a party of 9, they refilled our drinks took our order properly and had a professional demeanor.  Overall I liked it and was eager to revisit. So we did! Three weeks later.  Let me just say our second visit just the two of us was just as good, and might I say better! I didn't know they had Puerco Pibil! I got so excited since it's probably the most complex dish I ever created on my own, in my twenties, and was wondering how good would it taste.  People of Yelp, please try this dish! It's AMAZING!  Just the right amount of citrus and spice (not overly spicy) served with tortillas, rice and black beans! So so so so so good. Damn my stomach is rumbling.  This place will hopefully continue to surprise me as I try something different with every future visit.   The ambiance is perfect. You feel like your in someone kitchen, and they are whipping up some amazing Mexican food.  I give it 4 out of 5, just because I haven't tried most of the menu but it's promising enough to earn my business.",

We started with the queso with pabalno chilies and chorizo, then chicken and beef taquitos, a chili relleno, then chili Verde and chili Colorado tamales, and steak ranchero . The sauce on the chili relleno omgosh so good. The salsa is the right amount of heat. The service was above and beyond awesome. I can't believe this isn't listed as the top Mexican place on vegas.",

It was a great sauce and I wish I had some bread to sop up the juices left after everything was gone.  I finished it like I would any tasty broth.  Dessert was an order of cream filled churros.  They came with a side of ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate.  Delicious!  The restaurant is really a comfortable place.  Service was very good.  The man and woman helped each other and they were very pleasant and polite.  This was my first visit, but it won't be my last.  Make sure you check the specials board when you come in the door.",

For dinner, I had the chicken bomba and it was very flavorful with a slight twist on the traditional chicken fajita dish.  The bomba comes with mushrooms, red and green peppers, cheese and all the traditional fixings.    The lunch taco plate was perfectly balanced components and just the right amount of food.

    "text": "This is a really cute place with tasty Mexican food and a cozy feel. My friend and I came in around 8 on a weeknight - it was still busy! That's a good sign, and when we were seated immediately, I knew it was going to be a good experience, and it was.  The salsa is yummy- not very spicy but a really good flavor. Our food came out pretty quickly - one of my tacos had cotija cheese on it, which I had asked them to replace with regular cheese, but our server took it away immediately and came back quickly with a replacement. I ordered a taco and an enchilada with rice and beans - the taco was good, but the enchilada was really delicious! Next time I'll probably just go with enchiladas only. I love their enchilada sauce. Their beans and rice were a little lacking in flavor, but were still good and I enjoyed my dinner. I was a little under the weather, and I really appreciated the good service we received - I was downing glasses of water quickly and the staff made sure I always had a full glass.  My friend ordered a taco al pastor and thought it was good, but was put off by pineapples in the taco. I'm not sure if it was specified in the menu, so if not, just be aware.   I just moved back to Vegas and I'm trying everything out, but I could definitely see myself coming back to Frank and Fina's - the food and service were good, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.",

    "text": "The family was back in Vegas over 4th of July weekend, and so we had to come back to Frank & Fina's for some authentic Mexican, and man they didn't disappoint, at all!  Last year we visited on 4th of July, this year we visited a couple days before the 4th, thinking it would be less full, and boy were we wrong! It was actually packed (and for a very good reason!). Fortunately, we were seated immediately upon getting there, and were delighted to see that a couple of the waitresses recognized us from our previous trip, welcoming us back.  You can't come to F&F's and not order the Empanadas appetizer! You just can't! Four beef/cheese filled turnovers, that taste awesome paired with the chipotle ranch dip that comes with them! Hands down their signature appetizer!  On this particular visit, we were fortunate that the house specials of the day included Spinach Tamales (pictured). While I didn't taste them, pops and moms each had one and they both loved the taste and texture of it. Moms wasn't expecting it to taste great, but the seasoning of the spinach won her over. Being a vegetarian, she often complaints that there isn't much great tasting vegetarian fare these days at restaurants. She kept complementing how great the tamale tasted and pops echoed her sentiment. A first, since we're used to tamales with pork/chicken/dulce, but never one made of spinach. Kudos for the great idea to the folks at F&F's!  Myself, I was hungry and so I had the Shrimp al Mojo de Ajo and the Al pastor burrito. The servings here are always generous, and so I skipped on the beans/rice and gave those to my parents, and I just went in on the shrimp and the burrito. It was my first time tasting the Al pastor burrito here, and I am glad I did. It is now one of my favorite dishes here at F&F's. The meat tender, cooked to perfection, and the Al pastor flavoring just perfect, not too heavy, not too lean. The Shrimp were also great tasting and plentiful. It took well over an hour, but managed to finish my entree LOL  Overall, service was great as always (And who doesn't appreciate when the wait staff actually remembers you from a year ago?). That is truly an awesome thing. So far, we are 2/2 with F&F's and have made it our favorite Vegas Mexican restaurant. We shall return in the fall again!  Until then, happy adventures folks!",

This led us to Frank & FIna's quite by accident, but what a wonderful accident it was!  AMBIANCE:  EXCELLENT.  The lighting was low and the art was appealing.  There were plenty of tables to assure that we didn't have a wait, but were spaced out enough so that no one felt crowded.  SERVICE:  EXCELLENT.  The staff there were friendly and quick to assist us.  Our server checked back with us often but was not overbearing.  Our food was hot, delivered promptly and our drinks were always filled.  FOOD:  VERY GOOD.  The chips were excellent.   The salsa did have a thick tomato taste (almost ketchup-like) but had just enough kick to appeal to everyone.  We certainly didn't hesitate to polish off the bowl.  Other dishes we tried were the Carne Asada Burrito and nachos.  We found all to be very tasty.  The only criticism was on the amount of cheese on the nachos.  It was VERY thick, masking the other flavors too much.  OVERALL:  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town and craving good Mexican cuisine.",

The restaurant is quite attractive, much better than you'd expect from the exterior.  We ordered a nachos to share and I ordered carne asada tacos and carnitas tacos, both in soft corn tortillas.  The first thing that arrived were the chips and salsa - I see a lot of love for their salsa on Yelp, however I found it tasted almost exactly like \"Diablo\" style pasta sauce and every bite sent me flashing back to the last time I lazily poured half a jar of the stuff over a plate full of hastily prepared rigatoni. Chips were good and the salsa was clearly prepared with care, just not to my taste at all.  The nachos were quite light and pleasant and provided a nice grazing option while waiting for our meals.  When the tacos arrived I was pleased. The carnitas were delicious and crispy in parts and the asada was cooked to delicious perfection. About the only improvement I could suggest for these tacos would be some element to combat them being just a tiny bit dry, perhaps some guacamole or sour cream as standard. Luckily I had some left over with the nachos and this complimented them well.  Service was great throughout and overall I really enjoyed my meal here.",

    "text": "This little treasure was somewhat hidden in the Grand Canyon Shops that contain Sears, Target, and Kohls.  I knew of the other restaurants around there including Fudruckers but for some reason had passed over this diamond.   My friend was the one who took me here and lauded the food with praise.  She wasn't fibbing.  The decor is quaint and has a very warm and coyz feel, almost like you were stepping into an older cantina or as a friend I recently took there suggested, it is reminiscent of Old Town in San Deigo.    The servers are alwasy very friendly and described the items on the menu like you could taste them.   On my most recent trip, my party had the steak and shrimp fajita, a shredded beef dish, and I had the delectable tilapia fish tacos.  We all took tastes of each other's dishes.  I will say that the steak was not bad but not as fantastic in comparision to our other offerings.  The salsa and chips were fantastic and had just the right kick.  The queso appetizer was also very good although a little too thick in consistency to my liking, the others in my party ate it up with great delight.  The Tilapia tacos were the hands down winner.  My friend exclaimed that it was the best fish taco she had ever had even topping the ones she had at the Laughing Marlin in Mazatlan ( a hard act to follow no doubt).    My other friend was from Mexico and he said that the food was very authentic and everything was very comforting and delicious.",

We headed to Frank & Fina's Cocina which we had stumbled upon during our previous shopping extravaganza.   We were seated right away, despite the fact it was a hoppin Saturday night! Drink and chips were served very promptly by a friendly server. The margaritas were excellent and perfect ratio of alcohol to mixers.  We ordered a few plates and ate them \"family style\" We had a Relleno, Mole Enchiladas and Carnitas Tacos. Yum, yum and yum. 100% satisfaction with all dishes. This has quickly moved up to my #1 \"everyday\" Mexican restaurant. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items.   Fresh ingredients, full of flavor, reasonable prices. SOLD!",

It also meant we had fantastic service, and we got our food right away and didn't eat our weight in chips and amazing salsa. My wife got the tacos as she did the last time, and was very pleased. I had the veggie taquitos, which were incredible. They were filled with potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash and zucchini. They were fried, but didn't have the grease dripping out of them like you can find elsewhere. They came with sour cream and a very good guacamole, which were nice additions to the meal.  I definitely preferred the food this time around, probably because we didn't wait long and it was super fresh.",

One thing that genuinely impressed me was the way he took time to tell us about some of their specials and their specialties the way a formal restaurant does. He has a way of making you love the food before you even know what to order. It was great!  Everyone ordered something different, and everyone LOVED the food. I'm dying to go back asap!

The chips are not greasy and the salsa is not too spicy, but flavorful. The menu items can be found at any typical Mexican restaurant. We always get the chicken or carnitas burrito served enchilada style. The meat is always very tasty and the rice and beans are prepared accordingly. Other items I have tried include, green chile pork and taquitos. Both are very good.   The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere very Southwest looking. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I started going to Frank & Fina's a few years ago when it was a smaller 15-ish table restaurant. They have since taken over the space next door and doubled the size of the dining room.  You have to assume that the quality and value that they have has generated a loyal following who have recommended it to others.
