    "text": "So just to start their shrimp were amazing and the seasonings in general are pretty darn good. The reason I gave 2 and not more is simply because the crawfish were very small and the didn't even have any fresh available. I'm very disappointed because crawfish is in their name and the frozen ones they did have (which came at a cheaper rate $10/pound) were really not good. I had about 30 random claws at the bottom of the bag and the fish were very small. I'd probably just go to a buffet and eat em there next time. But really the shrimp were on point. Thanks!",

    "text": "So, I can to Vegas for vacation, like many. When I was told there was a crawfish join in town, I knew I had to visit the place. So I was super excited to have some awesome shrimp and crawfish with the amazing seasoning and spice. Let's get started:  The Food Everything was delicious and quite satisfying. A friend and I shared the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" combo and that was perfect! We also had to order the cajun fries. Cajun fries were okay. I wish they had extra Cajun spice to it. Also, I like my Cajun fries with ketchup mayo and they were accommodating with no charge; where other places have charged me for that request.   The Service The servers were pretty normal. Nothing too exciting. My colleagues had stated they wish the server would check in with us more often.   Overall, if you craving some crawfish...here is the place to go.",

    "text": "Hot N juicy, Las Vegas Strip.  Restaurant or club? The new location serves up good food but thinks it's a hip hop club on the strip. What a way to ruin the good reputation this restaurants other two locations have built up. We had shrimp, crab and catfish. Nothing to complain about with the food.  The service was good.  I asked the server if they could turn the music down and they did but it fluctuated thereafter. Not a pleasing environment to enjoy dinner. The rapping hip hop, stole the show. It's not even a pleasant R & B but straight up hip hop. Now I know why they were not close to full on a Saturday night with no wait.  The food remains good but unless you want to eat at a hip hop /restaurant club stay away from this Las Vegas strip location and hit the original. If that's your thing, by all means, be sure to visit. If you have a family avoid this location at all cost. This location may want to try an island or top 40 vibe as that music may be more appropriate and more family friendly.. Just something more soothing. I spoke with our server later and they agreed but the owners obviously think this club environment is the way to go. I noticed the servers were having a hard time hearing as much as the customers. Club or Restaurant? What does Hot N Juicy want to be? We chose the wrong location this time. It want happen again. Very disappointing especially for the price.",

I ordered a few pounds of crawfish in their special garlic butter based sauce, as well clams, and blue crabs. Everything was delightful and we all enjoyed our seafood. Hot N Juicy was so good, I went every day that I was visiting Las Vegas & I purchased a T-Shirt that I adored. Definitely come here for great seafood and the warm friendly customer service.  P.S they will only seat you if your full party is there, which I don't mind since I am in the restaurant industry and it's totally understandable seeing that they often have a waitlist.",

Service was a little slow towards the end to get the check and pay but otherwise no complaints. Thanks for opening a location by the strip. We'll be back!!",

The extra spicy Hot N Juicy sauce amplified the flavors of the shellfish and the corn and potatoes that came with the crawfish. The waitress warned me that it might be too spicy but it was just fine for me. The corn fritters though.. biting in to these was like fireworks in your mouth! A definite must get if you come here!

I ordered a pound of crawfish and a pound of clams in the Hot N Juicy sauce extra spicy just for myself.  I didn't think it was spicy at all, and most other places I've been to, when I get it spicy, it actually burns my lips.  And they put my crawfish and clams in separate bags, which was fine.  But the clams were 95% empty shells because most of the clam meat had fallen out and I had to dip my fingers in the sauce to look for them.  It didn't feel like there was enough clam meat hiding in the sauce to match the number of empty shells.  We still enjoyed our dinner and left full.",

We're seated quickly order and drinks are taken at a timely manner which is great, thank you slim white girl w the glasses. But when our food came out it was cold :( Also it was not seasoned entirely, like there was a normal amount of sauce but not mixed around with the seafood.. ?  It was not hot in temperature at all like it usually is at other hot n juicy locations. I tasted the green mussels or black cant remember, but they tasted so disgusting like dirty seafood. UGH so gross man, usually when i order those they taste like the hot n juicy sauce... Weird overall food was disappointing , not what it usually is at the spring mtn locations.. Total waste of money.

    "text": "The atmosphere was nice enough, but this was a great example of style over substance.  I came here around 3pm on a Saturday with my family hoping to get my fix of raw oysters that I miss so much after moving to the southwest but was sadly disappointed. I know it's the strip, half a dozen was $13, I wouldn't complain about that at all were they not literally all smaller than a Starburst candy. I knew I should have called Uber and gone somewhere that wasn't touristy (i.e. not the strip) but we were hungry. On top of this the service was horrible, it wasn't busy and I'd say it was even overstaffed, yet every dish for the four of us came out at extremely different times, Oysters and a Calamari app first, one po'boy for my brother 10 minutes later, chicken nuggets for my Mother another 10 minutes later, and 30 minutes later another po'boy for our friend. He got tired of waiting and asked to cancel it so we could leave since we'd nearly finished but was told it'd be out in two minutes (it wasn't).  The really annoying part was the manager coming over and explaining in a patronising way that fried food cooks differently than non-fried food, and no we didn't mishear her say they cook at different rates, nothing on our table wasn't fried aside from the earlier oysters. We pointed this out and that despite coming in long after us the table next to us was served first, it was also all fried and served at very odd times. The \"spicy\" Cajun sandwiches and calamari were bland but at least edible, the oysters were fine but *ridiculously* small, the chicken was awful however.  Maybe it was a bad day, but I'd never go back nor recommend it to anyone.",

We were told there would be a 25 minute wait for the two of us, but we got seated within 5 minutes, so that was very nice! After being seated, we got our menus and it took a little while before we ordered. I got a pound of crawfish hot n juicy, extra spicy with 3 potatoes and cajun fries. The crawfish was okay, I didn't love the sauce like I do with The Boiling Crab or any of the other chains in SoCal. It wasn't as garlicky or robust in flavor as I like it. Extra spicy maybe could pass for a medium at other places, so that was a little disappointing too. They charge $0.75/potato. Lastly, I can't believe how salty the cajun fries were. I ended up not finishing them, because they didn't have much flavor but saltiness. Hardly any cajun spice. Overall, I was excited to see such high ratings for this place, but my experience was a letdown. At these prices, I expected higher quality food. The servers did seat us quickly and checked up on us frequently, but it took a little while to get our order in. 3/5 stars.",

Our favorite flavors Are the Hot N Juicy and the Garlic Butter. Their oysters are always fresh. Cajun fries are on point. Typically we get clams in Garlic Butter; and crawfish, snow crab legs, and shrimp in the Hot N Juicy. Their spice level is pretty on point. Medium does have a kick to it. I've had a friend order extra extra spicy (he pops ghost peppers like nothing) and that was definitely on his level.  If you're a fan of Cajun boil, do not pass up a chance to try this place. It's conveniently located on the strip right outside of the miracle mile shops next to planet Hollywood.",

Luckily, I was with a bunch guy friends and colleagues who were more than happy to help me crack my crab legs and peel my shrimp.    I'm not a crawfish lover but I love Crab.  The Crab Legs were yummy delicious.   The food all comes out in a plastic bag all steamed, hot and spicy.   The appetizers were yummy too.   Now this place only serves Beer and sodas.  No alcohol and no wine. So that's one less Star.  Other than that everything was great.  After getting the hang of it, I finally was able to fill my belly and keep up with the guys.   Ambiance is nice and the staff was very helpful and accommodating.    Forks up on Hot N Juicy.  I'll be back this summer!",

It's tucked away on the side of Planet Hollywood Casino so you don't have to travel far from your resort. We went on a Friday night in the summer and there was no wait at all to get in.  It's a simple concept for a restaurant but so delicious! I love spicy food but you don't have to get it spicy if you can't handle the heat. I've tried different things over the years including shrimp, mussels, crab, and crawfish. This time I had the green mussels, hot and juicy seasoning, medium spice level.  They tend to go heavy on the seasoning so beware when you order that if you get medium it will be pretty spicy.  I've gotten sides of rice, fries, and bread. I love dipping the fries in the left over sauce in my bag. Yum yum.  Be prepared to get messy! They give you a bib and plastic gloves to wear if needed. (I highly recommend it) Check this place out! The two locations on Spring Mountain are great as well!",

The atmosphere is very casual and the first thing i noticed was people eating with plastic bibs on.  At a closer look, the tables were covered in plastic and the ordered food all came in plastic bags.  No bowls or plates.  We ordered crawfish, shrimp, and snow crabs with the hot and juicy sauce at the lowest spice level since we had you kids. We ordered spicy sauce on the side for the adults.  Once the order came, we had a fun experience pulling the food out of plastic bags and piling the shells on our table.  The kids enjoyed eating with their hands and we all loved what reminded me of Cajun flavor. I preferred the shrimp and the snow crab over the crawfish mainly because of the amount of return for the work of peeling was better than the crawfish.   I also want to leave a little shout out to the our server. She was great in showing us how to peel the crawfish and bringing us extra plastic gloves, paper towels, etc.",

    "text": "Our last two trips to Vegas included at least one dinner here. We usually come to celebrate birthday's so have a larger group than most. The food is always good. My usual go-to is the crawfish or shrimp in the spicy hot n juicy sauce with potatoes, corn and a side of rice. We tried the garlic butter sauce this time and it was good as well. My husband doesn't like to peel anything so he goes for their crawfish poboy which isn't bad either (could use more crawfish though). This last time we were there it started off great, the server took all our orders and started bringing out the drinks.  Shortly after drinks came out he was moved to another section and everything went down the drain. Our order got so messed up - drinks never came out, food was wrong etc. The servers that were helping us had attitude and any time we pointed out what was still missing their looked annoyed with us. At the very beginning of our meal someone ordered a coke but didn't get it until after he was done eating despite us reminding them twice about it. One of the meals we ordered came so late we ended up taking it to go because we already delayed with our evening plans due to all the mix up. Good food, but it will probably be a better experience with a small group. No pictures because everyone was busy eating and hands were good and dirty...lol.",

It included 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp and 1/2 lb of crab legs, around 12 slices of sausage, 2 corns, and 2 potatoes. Also appetizer of fried calamari. We order the hot n juicy sauce with mild which was spicy because I am used to Shaking Crab medium spicy and this was so much difference. I hope this place will come to Boston.",

Luckily there was no wait on a Thursday evening and the seafood came out quickly. I had the mussels and snow crabs in the a mild juicy cajun sauce and it was a tad bit more spicy than anticipated however, it was soooooo good. I definitely recommend this spot to anyone craving a casual seafood dining experience.",

Unfortunately I didn't get to try any cause I was destroying my own pound of shrimp! It was so good, I understand why their name is \"Hot n Juicy\" because the food is just that!

We tried the \"get your feet wet\" option - 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp, 2 potatoes, 2 corn & plenty of sausage ($36). Tried the hot n juicy sauce - spicy level.

Add a side of Cajun fries and oddly enough the wings aren't too shabby either.  On our second day we added a pound of shrimp and glad we did. Delicious! What keeps this place from being a 5 star is the service seems disorganized. Which ever waiter/ress is free will seat you vs. having a host and the set up is its difficult to see the front of the restaurant. The staff also doesn't check on you often so be ready to waive em down. The second attempt was better service.  But the food alone is a definitely repeat.

We got the combination of The Drool. Came with one pound of crawfish. Shrimp, Crab Legs, Corns, Potatoes, & Sausages. And others items I may have left out.

The waitress that helped me out was very helpful and nice.   Got home all excited but we CANNOT eat any of it! None of it. Everything was too spicy. My wife loves spicy seafood, took one (1) bite and her face turned red right away. Again, we ordered \"mild\" so we just couldn't believe how spicy everything was. I understand the name of the restaurant is Hot n Juicy but this is just insane.   Called them up to see what can be done since we had just paid close to $85. They said that they \"cannot control the batch of peppers they get\" and it can get really spicy. I was also advised to cook our food up again in butter. So our parents are currently recooking the meal that we paid for. Feeling very frustrated.   I'm not sure if it would've been different if we ate in the restaurant and if this is the norm for their \"mild\" spiciness. If it is, I'm not sure why they even have that as an option and please be warned that it is VERY HOT!",

I order the same thing every time I'm in town which is a pound of shrimp and clams in the Hot n Juicy sauce at a mild level. Let me tell you that the mild is actually pretty spicy itself. I would compare it to most other Cajun seafood spots' medium. So if you're not big into spiciness, the mild spice may be good enough for you. Anyways, the seafood here always seems to be fresh and Cooke just right. If you're really hungry and can't wait long for your seafood, I would order the Cajun fries - they are so yummy!!",

HOT N JUICY ENTIRE SET UP IS TRASH COMPARED TO BOILING CRAB. Literally, it's a trash bag on the table.   The Hot N Juicy sauce is weak AF. The level of spicy doesn't match the intensity. If I want Medium I probably should have went to the next level of spicy.  The Sausage is cut weird AF. I ordered a pound and that definitely wasn't a pound.   Dry seasoning is needed, I couldn't even order lemon pepper fries.  Last, most of your methods are cheap AF lol, that kitchen napkin holder on the tables doesn't sit well with me.   Hot N Juicy is a NO for me ",

They only let you choose one flavor for the seafood as they are putting all of it in 1 bag. We picked the most popular flavor, hot n juicy in mild spiciness. We love the hot n juicy flavor it was really delicious, but the crawfish were so tiny and mushy! The shrimp was mushy and sticking to the shell. A warning from the waiter about the not fresh tiny crawfish would be great. Was not satisfied it had no crawfish taste! Feeling completely ripped off. Did not want to pay for it. Call in and ask what's crawfish size and freshness if you decide to come here. This place has so many good reviews wished it was that good for me. It's not so hot n juicy crawfish as it claims to be.

The Hot n Juicy sauce and the garlic butter were way too sweet, unlike their other Las Vegas locations. I'm not sure if they changed their recipe or the chef added too much sugar by accident.  I love blue crab and they didn't have it. The girl who seated us didn't tell us, so I was disappointed to find out they didn't have it when I ordered. I thought it was weird that the hostess wouldn't just tell us they didn't have it when she seated us, but then I saw another table get seated and they were told right away. I wish they told us so I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. So I guess my server wasn't as good as the other one.",

If you are a visitor with a car or transportation... it may be best for you to go to either of the other locations to get the TRUE Hot N Juicy experience.   Coming to the new location, we expected the experience to be better than, or at least similar to the other locations.   However, the prices were a little more at this location, but that wasn't the problem. EVERYTHING they brought to the table contained next to NO sauce. We were treating my niece for her birthday and she ordered The Experience which came with a butt load of items... and it too had almost NO SAUCE! So, we had to order extra sauce for each order. Finally, my sister ordered a pound of snow crab and it come with only 5 legs.   We spoke to the host to inquire about the increase in prices and to address the lack of sauce and the missing crab legs. His only justification was, \"Well, this is The Strip.\" We were not satisfied with his explanation. So, he said he'd speak to the lead server. Unfortunately,  he came back to say his lead server said there was NOTHING they could do. So, we asked for the Manager. His response was, \"Well, the Manager is a little too busy right now.\" We told him we'd wait!   Eventually,  the manager come to the table and he agreed that there was no way that those 5 pieces amounted to 1 pound and that each bag should have contained more sauce. So, he offered to compensate by taking the extra sauces off the bill and to prepare the other half of the missing crab legs (it took FOREVER to come out though).   In the end... we paid our $160, and we will NOT be coming back or making recommendations for this location.",

I'd called ahead to alert them of our large group of 18, and although they don't accept reservations, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for tables to be ready to accommodate our large group. We ended up at two long tables, with one table sharing assorted pounds of very spicy seafood, and the other table ordering mostly on our own. Our server was excellent, and no one had to wait for their next beverage.  Having dined at the Orlando location several times, I knew I liked Baby Spice, as I find it less intense than just garlic butter (which is an option by itself in Orlando), and I chose snow crabs on this visit. As I'd hoped, my crab legs were large & tasty! And, as expected, very MESSY! So unfortunately, I have no photos... because you know I had to keep my phone safe.  This Hot N Juicy is on two levels, so seating seems plentiful. And this location is very central on the Strip, just outside of Planet Hollywood. So while its a cheap Lyft from nearly any of the big resorts, some of our group enjoyed walking back to Luxor that night.",

However, I walked into this location expecting it to be perfect like my home location that I visit every week in Orlando and it was not. First off the welcome was dismal. In Orlando they yell welcome to hot n juicy and I like the excitement. The service was good but not super friendly bc no one asked us how we were or why we were there which was to celebrate my sisters birthday.. taking a moment to be personal is what makes experiences special. The Orlando location always welcomes us like we are special. Now the food was on point!! Super delicious seafood and so fresh... nothing but the highest quality seafood. They only use fresh never frozen seafood and you can absolutely taste the difference. We had crabs, crawfish, green mussels, shrimp, oysters, fried chicken...pretty much everything. Hot and Juicy Vegas continues lives up to the name. The only food item I didn't care for was the sausage bc it was a little too spicy for me. I order my seafood in Hot and Juicy sauce - baby spice temperature level. Follow me on ig @sweet_maloy. Bottom line is I would definitely return and eat everything!",

    "text": "As a Hot N Juicy veteran, it's important to note the first thing you need to know, and that's your spice level. Hot N Juicy offers fried items including shrimp, calamari, catfish, etc. Hot N Juicy shines when you decide to get half of pound/a pound of shrimp, crawfish, crab, potatoes, sausage, corn, etc., this is where the spice level come in. You can get your food seasoned a certain (Hot N Juicy) is the best way to go, then you choose your spice level. Be cautious on what you get, baby spice had a minor kick, the intensity of spice leaps as you make the hard decision on what to choose, so be smart. Hot N Juicy makes you dip your food back into the seasoning for better flavor. The snow crab is amazing, and rarely requires the cracking utensil.   The ambience was great. The venue played Hip Hop the whole time I was there so enjoyed a great meal with music I enjoy.",

I had the one pound of shrimp, only $16, good price, we had the catfish poboy, my husband had the Get Your Feet Wet, which comes with shrimp, crawfish, sausage, corn and potatoes with the hot and juicy seasoning. They only reason for the 4 star rating is that the crawfish were very small and frozen, but to be fair, the waiter told us this before we ordered. The shrimp were absolutely delicious and the sandwich bread was soooooo fresh!! I will make this a constant for dinner every single time we are in Vegas..",

    "text": "The fiancee and I are in town for a business/vacay and she found this place in her search for nearby eats. We were surprised at finding a boiled seafood joint so far from the Gulf, so curiosity plus all these good reviews made us venture in. Having lived in Louisiana for many years, I'm often skeptical of boiled crawfish even in Houston, because I've been to so many places that Houstonians consider to have great crawfish, and walked out disappointed at the least or even disgusted. So coming in here, I honestly almost just took the safe road and ordered a fried platter. But instead I went with the Vegas vibe and \"rolled the dice.\" I ordered both crawfish and shrimp--one with Louisiana flavor and the other with Juicy Cajun--both medium spice. I initially asked for spicy but the waitress cautioned that people should order one level down from what they think they want. The fiancee ordered snow crab legs, mild, with Hot N Juicy flavor.   We were both pleased with the flavors. She especially liked the Louisiana on my shrimp, as so many places in Houston label their flavor something LA related, then deliver a gunky mess nothing like the \"coon asses\" eat. I wished I had stuck with spicy because medium was not as spicy as I like.   Overall, Hot N Juicy did their thang! This was good eating!",

We usually sit at the bar in restaurants, but, because we were going to eat \"something boiled,\" we were told we needed to sit at a table. I assume there's just not enough room at the bar for everything you'll need: paper towels (lots of them), gloves, bibs, etc.  We ordered a pound of crawfish with garlic butter seasoning and mild spice. Our waiter advised us that the crawfish is frozen, which mildly disappointed us, but we were already so excited it didn't seem to matter much.  It was delicious, but VERY messy. The crawfish was brought out in a plastic bag, which I think was probably the same bag in which they were frozen.  We will probably be back, but this time, we'll know what to expect!",

We had swimwear underneath our clothes but I was wearing shorts and a woven coverup. Literally, covered! But got denied. The day before I knew someone who also got denied. And also a group of girls after me as well. They're reasoning is: we're a family owned business. I'm confused. But this is Vegas strip. Hm. Strange. So be forewarned, they are strict on their clothing policy.   Anyhow, they did let us order it to go anyways. $14/lb... so I ordered 4 lbs, Cajun fries, and wings. Came out to be about $75. So we had to bring it back to our hotel to eat. Imagine how our room smelt after ... lol extremely garlicky. Overall, if you want crawfish, yes come here but maybe not because they'll have a ton of rules and not customer friendly. It's 100+ degree weather, but wear a sweater and jeans to come here apparently.",

The only issues I had with this place is that it was unorganized as far as when they brought the food out.  They brought out our bag of crawfish first, then 15 minutes later brought out one bag of shrimp, 20 minutes later they brought out another bag of shrimp.  They brought out one po boy sandwich and brought out the other po boy sandwich 20 minutes later..... This is unacceptable.  An organized restaurant knows how to bring everything out at one time, or at least within a 5 minute range.  Other than that, the food was good, but the shrimp was overcooked, which made it hard to peel.  We picked the right seasonings for our steamed seafood. I would go back, but I would ask that everything come out on time.",

The calamari could have been seasoned a bit more but I added Cajun season (which was super hot) lemon and dipped them them in the marinara sauce and they were good. The shrimp was seasoned well and all the food was hot when it came out l. The catfish was good also. The only thing that I could have asked for was regular hot sauce (not tabasco) and a basket with both shrimp and catfish.",

Since this location was closest we called in for the order and picked up. It tasted good, they were pretty quick. So where is the problem? 8 out of 10 people got the bubble guts. Seems that shrimp was the culprit. Thank god our suite had 3 bathrooms. Maybe it was just a bad batch or to go is not the way to go, I just know that it got most of our party sick. Their stomach hurt for 2 days and 1 of those days we had to drive back down to San Diego. I know, sweet ride right? I like Hot N Juicy, Next time though, I will opt for dining in at their Chinatown location (:",

We always order the seafood in Hot N Juicy sauce medium. The sauce is filed with minced garlic, Cajun seasoning, lemon pepper and other spices. The spice level is just perfect for my taste buds. It's not an immediate hit of spice, but it definitely builds up. I live out in LA and we do have one in Hollywood, but I do prefer the one here. If you're a Cajun seafood fan, I recommend trying this at least once.",

I ended up getting a pound of shrimp baby spice garlic butter flavor with some corn and a bowl of rice. Everything came out great! Perfect amount of all the spices.

They did offer to bib me this time which was weird... no offense but i can do it myself. I was greeted by Ashley and Nikki who helped me last time which was good to see. I love those two girls because they are just so sweet!! long wait and seem to be super busy. Paul was my server who did excellent! It's right next door to nacho daddy and bww.

    "text": "Ok really.  When my friend asked me if I'd ever had  Hot n Juicy Crawfish- I was skeptical.  Is this a shot I don't know about?  Some sort of innuendo perhaps?  Then she explained what it was.  Seafood boil in a bag- sounds intriguing!  We headed on over and from the moment I walked in I was ready for the experience!!!! So first off, if you don't like to get dirty whilst eating- this is NOT the place for you.  They sit you down at a plastic covered table and slap down menus and bibs.  Yes, BIBS.  So if you're into getting your hands a bit slimy- you better just commit right now.  It's worth every bit! We got the Snow Crab, King Crab, and Shrimp.  Then you can add other boil items to it such as potatoes, corn, sausage, rice or rolls.  They bring out these double plastic bagged morsels of goodness and set em on your table and you just dig in.  It is messy and yummy and messy and garlicky and, well, heaven in a bag!!!!!  The spice meter is a bit on the high side, but thankfully our server let us know this in advance.  So I ordered a mild and my nose was running for sure.  Two of us got the garlic butter sauce, the other person got the hot and juicy- which is all the sauces combined.  We had a side of garlic butter and when it came out it was a brick red color- so as you can imagine- there was some heat.  But the funny thing was- we all agreed the side could have been a base to a really good soup base!   All in all everything was so good!  The atmosphere was fun, the bar was comprehensive, service was fast but laid back.  I would recommend this place to anyone traveling through.",

    "text": "TL;DR Come here for crappy non existent service and food that will leave you more dehydrated than the Sahara desert!   I honestly cannot believe this place has as good reviews as it does. Maybe just because it's a convenient seafood place to go to on the strip? Yes, we did have a party of 8 so understandably we knew it'd be a wait. However everything went downhill when we were seated upstairs. Water was given to us promptly as soon as we arrived but that was the only \"service\" we received the whole dining time. We all ordered various seafood (crawfish, shrimp, snow crab legs) at different spice levels. Our waitress tried to \"warn\" us about the spice levels but honestly that was a whole mess up. How can my friend's \"baby spice\" level be more spicy than the \"medium (in actuality 'hot' spice level)\"?? My friend who cannot tolerate any spice ordered baby spice for that particular reason yet she spit out the sausages in her bag because it was so spicy to the point of bitterness whereas the medium crawfish and shrimp I ordered was mild to the max! Two of our group got the seafood we ordered whereas the rest of the group had to wait at least another 20-25 min before everyone got their bags. Even after delivering my friend's bag of snow crab legs she had to wait an additional 15-20 min for a crab leg cracker! We must have asked 4 different servers and didn't even get any until most of us were halfway through done eating! Any additional requests for water refills, lemon, or salt and pepper were either ignored/forgotten. It was as if they knew they had served us badly near the end of our meal when they tried to check on us multiple times the last 15 minutes we were there. Even getting our check was a real pain in the neck. We watched the waitress who took our cards down for processing walk back upstairs, look at us, realize that she had taken our cards already 10 min ago then walk back downstairs to get our cards for ya because she had forgotten to bring them back! There are most definitely better places to dine on the strip. A hard pass and a never returning again for our group! Food was mediocre and no other seasoning besides super salty and mixed up spicy levels. Service was essentially nonexistent! I hope management sees this review and changes the policy on how customers who are seated upstairs are treated. Yes I understand that it's more work to walk upstairs and serve but that does not mean that it's ok either that we deserve to be forgotten or requests ignored! The most disappointing part of our Las Vegas trip for sure!",

She offered to bring out water, we asked for one glass without ice, she brought back 3 glasses of water all with ice. We then asked her for a glass of club soda without ice 4 different times and she never brought it. She never once apologized for forgetting several times, she just said \"okay\" as if we didn't ask her 4 times. I then had to ask Travis for the club soda and he brought it to our table in less than 30 seconds. Tasha came to check on us to see if we needed anything, we asked her for crackers for our crab and 20 minutes later still no crackers. I look back and she was just standing next to the register by the kitchen. I then had to ask a different server and he was able to bring it back right away. I saw her sat down 2 guests next to us and she never came back to give them their drinks or take their order they had to wave to get their order taken. I saw that Travis was busy but he still went out of his way to take a order from Tasha's section. Aside from our server's service, the food was good, we ordered the drool combo, cajun fries, and an extra lbs of crawfish. Their house sauce is pretty good. The rest of the servers were super nice. Mary was very nice and helpful as well.",

    "text": "YIKES! I was really hoping to write a 5-star review but my experience wasn't as good as I thought it would be (giving this place a 3.5).   This restaurant was strongly recommended by a friend and on top of that it has some pretty neat reviews on yelp so my girls and I figured we'll give it a try. The atmosphere was very casual and laid back. All of the employees were extremely friendly and food was okay. So you are probably wondering why a 3.5 star so here it goes...The servers were friendly and consistently refilled out drinks but where they fell short on was the \"over-promising\" and \"under-delivering.\" Our main server refilled our drinks multiple times and promised that the food should be out shortly but we still waited for a fairly long time. The server also promised that he'll come right back with the Seafood Cracker but never came back. We had to inform another employee.    The seasoning was alright. It wasn't anything spectacular. I still prefer \"Firehouse Crawfish\" back in my hometown (Sacramento) but needless to say, I'll come back here again. Besides the fact that the servers were over-promising the food wasn't horrible. It was still good.  **The really cool thing was they have a sink outside of the bathroom for you to wash your hands.",

This is maybe my third or fourth time at a Hot N Juicy (I've gone to other locations in Vegas and in Anaheim).  I've never been disappointed with Hot N Juicy. This visit I had a pound of crawfish and half doz sausage in the hot n juicy sauce with medium spice, and the fried catfish.  The crawfish was delicious. My girlfriends were saying their spice levels were spicier than expected and compared to other places. I thought it had a good kick but was manageable. I might've been able to handle Spicy instead of Medium. The sausage pieces were HUGE and had such good flavor!  The fried catfish - BOMB. Deep fried to perfection and it was sooo moist and flavorful. Probably the best fried catfish I've had at a joint like this. If I were hungrier I would've gotten it as a combo with Cajun fries, but the four pieces of catfish was perfect for me.",

    "text": "BUYER BEWARE  Let me start by saying that I have been a devout Hot N Juicy crawfish fan way before they expanded to NYC, so this one star review kills me but it has to be done before someone else gets swindled. (But seriously, I own the HNJ LV tank top with the crawfish playing blackjack....I once drove an hour during a cruise stop in Port Canaveral to get to the Orlando location. I loved this place)  Last May, I had a work trip take me to Las Vegas and dined at the location on the strip. My friend visited from out of town the next night and was taken back that I would choose HNJ of all places for a work expensed dinner. As a thank you for letting him stay with me, he went the next day to purchase me $50 gift card from the LV strip location to enjoy once back in NYC.   Fast forward to February - I thought I would finally put my gift card to use here at HNJ NYC. While cashing out, the waitress came over to tell us that there was only $0.01 on the card. My initial reaction was that my friend's transaction never went through but wanted to make sure he wasn't charged $50 for a gift card that was never activated. I gave him a call and sure enough he was charged $50 by HNJ LV in May. I asked him to send me proof of purchase so I can pass along to them thinking that was all I needed to correct the error yet HNJ refused to honor it.  Keep in mind that this happened in February and I've been trying to resolve this and not be the person that takes to yelp to air out all grievances but unfortunately this is a scam and want to prevent anyone else from experiencing this -- imagine handing over your money to a company in good faith, and then gifting someone a $0.01 card-- not a good look for the company!   Here is a list of every single excuse HNJ has given me as to why they cannot honor this gift card: 1) You could not purchase gift cards during this time using a credit card so it's not even possible  2) This gift card number shows that it was purchased in February 2017 and then used in June 2018 3) My complaint with the BBB is invalid because I am the recipient and not the purchaser   My issues with the above 1) If you can't purchase gift cards with a credit card then pull up the transaction details from my friends purchase and let me know why he has a perfectly even $50 charge on his credit card statement from HNJ 2) Your gift cards don't even include a security pin, just a straight up gift card number. If they don't include a pin and you claim you can't even purchase them with a credit card, then how am I supposed to trust you have the infrastructure to ensure multiple people weren't issued the same gift card number? 3) Don't worry, the purchaser will also be filing a complaint with the BBB  This has gone on for months over a $50 gift card despite providing them with PoP. Hardly any way to do business.",

I've been to many similar styled places and me hearing people hype up this place got me excited but it was a disappointment. A heart breaker.  The only PROS: Most standard crab and crawfish places that do the Louisiana boil style have a standard of 4 sauces. (Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and all 3 mixed) but this place had 5. Also the spice levels can range from baby spice to extra spicy.   When you go to these type of places.. you have to get their signature sauce which for this place was hot n juicy sauce. It was OK. We got it for all our items (shrimp,crawfish, and mussels). It was a little too pastey tasting. I also didn't like the fact that the crawfish was frozen crawfish. Yeah they were alive at one point ...but there's a big difference in the taste. It definitely killed the vibe for the sauce they have. Also, I felt the medium spice was more spicy than medium. Most places I've been to I've been able to handle the spice but this was just berserk.   When you get your order it comes in a seafood bag. Whether you eat it for here or to go. Pricing is pretty hefty, but hey it's Vegas!!",

It was hard to catch one of them since they were all running around uncoordinated and the place wasn't even that packed. Had to wait to get crab claw crackers and that took forever since they were being washed (they need more of them). The crab claws were thin and the crawfish were small. Honestly your best bang for your buck is the shrimp. I remember this place being better.",

I ordered shrimp and crab legs of course. You are allowed to choose your level of  hotness I certainly didnt choose the hottest. I got mild and lemon garlic and it was delicious. It was cheaper than I expected and we didnt have to wait long to be seated.  I saw a few reviewers say they weren't allowed in with swim suits. I wasn't  wet and I did have on a short and shirt so maybe not having on a see through top will work when trying to come here after a pool party.  Also they have one in my city so I can't wait to go.",

Tables are covered in plastic wrap for easy clean up and I love that they issue a bib and plastic see thru gloves for easy handling of the food.    Dress is casual and staff is friendly.   When ordering you pick your:  1. specific seafood such as shrimp, mussels, crab or any combination  2. spiciness level from mild to super hot 3. then you pick your seasoning (ranges from garlic butter, old Bays etc)   I always order a half pound of shrimp (they are huge) and they have the head on them, 2 pieces of corn in garlic butter and Hawaiian rolls. The shrimp tastes so fresh and is very filling and satisfying! The shrimp are very easy to peel.  My mouth waters every time that I tell someone about this place!  I wish we had them at home In NC!  Be sure to check them Out!",

Don't waste your time ordering potatoes, sausage, and crab. Go straight to the shrimp or crawfish guys. Trust me. Get the whole shebang. But don't do what I did. Extra Spicy.

Everything had great flavor and was hot and fresh. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the plastic bags not being served on a tray. With a tray you can rip the bags partially and still keep the juices contained. The table gets way to messy for my liking and I know for most people it's all a part of the experience. Also I'm use to having the option of having the head on or off with the shrimp and here You get the head on. I do love the option of ordering the shrimp by the half pound instead of a whole pound like other places. With all that being said I had a great visit and would definitely go back.",

Our waiter said the medium can be pretty spicy but as someone with a decent spice tolerance, I felt like the mild did not have enough of a kick. The add-ins, like potatoes and corn, are fantastic to have to help fill you up. I also ordered mozzarella sticks but they were nothing special. The service was fantastic as we came in with a party of ten, were seated within 15 minutes, and were able to go Dutch in the bill. Our server was very patient with splitting the bill even when we saw his face fall a little hearing that we wanted to pay separate lol.",

The gloves are also very cheap and thin that you can feel the food burning through. When you take your gloves off, you'll also realize the sauce seeps right through and your fingers are dirty. Totally defeats the whole purpose of wearing the gloves. The calamari is dry and not as amazing as I expected. However, the shrimp was very fresh...we ordered two pounds of it. My dad thought the catfish po'boy sandwich was the best. Overall, we'd had better seafood with the same concept but perhaps for las vegas, it is something different and delicious for folks nearby. I do recommend to try The Boil in New York though! This just isn't a place I would go out of my way to come if I came back to Vegas.",

You wear plastic bibs and where plastic gloves and pick up your food from the plastic bags break it apart and eat.  The crawfish are truly juicy and delicious and the other items were tasty as well.

I called four times to ask different questions. The same young lady answered each time . She giggled the third and fourth time when I said \"hey, it's me again.\" God bless her. She was very helpful and knowledgeable.   We ordered shrimp and crawfish. At first I was disappointed.. but when I got deep into the bag I was delighted.  The flavoring was great and spicy enough that I had to take a break in between pounds.   My only complaint is that they don't seem to let the crawfish sit as long while preparing but this is the trade off for fast food type with numerous options to choose from.   I will def go again.",

So...my standards for all things seafood and coined as Cajun or creole are through the roof high. My favorite season of the year is CRAWFISH SEASON. I live for mud bugs and all cuisine Cajun and creole. I could go on and on talking about how no food is better than what we have in Louisiana but I will spare you at this time. So, Hot N Juicy....they don't have high rating for nothing! My friends and I needed a crawfish fix and this spot was literally across the street from where we were staying. We ordered: crawfish, corn, fish platters, shrimp po boy, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, and deep fried brownies. Almost forgot to throw in the snow crab legs. We got our seafood medium heat and seasoned in Hot N Juicy. The spice kick was just right. The seasoning stuck. It was nose running, lip burning glory! Since moving to Cali where the food has been subpar at best, Hot N Juicy was a nice change of pace for me tastebuds. I now have to see if the one in West Hollywood ranks in close comparison. The service was good. Our server kept our glasses full and made sure all was well. The prices were at market value. I cannot complain about market prices but what I can say is in Louisiana we are fortunate enough to get seafood for much less. Typically crawfish is sold at $2.99/lb live and depending  on time of season cooked ranges from $3.99-7.99/lb. I understand a business has to make a profit and it is not like crawfish are being plunked out the water in the west. Thank goodness home is only a short plane ride up the road.  I said all this to say...eat Hot N Juicy.",

My guest ordered snow crabs and shrimp (comes in bags with your choice of seasoning, wet or dry). You have the option of adding small baked potatoes and corn in your bags of seafood. It gets messy, just so you know! And, your waiter will give you the tools to crack the shellfish. On the dryer side, you can order fried seafood baskets with your choice of regular, cajun or sweet potato fries. I ordered a 4-pc fried catfish basket with a basket of crispy pork skins. Customer service is decent, but honestly you're just gonna be focused on the food anyway!",

As soon as I got to my table she greet my husband and I be brought over water with lemon. I was extremely parched from waiting and I was so happy I didn't have to ask for water. She explained the menu to me and the different seasonings and spices so that it was easier for me to pick. After I gave her my order, she let me know that although she was my server if she needed anything at all I could ask any other server but of course I wanted her to help me out. The whole time she made sure I had my drinks refilled and reassured me that my food was coming out soon after she checked the food in the kitchen. Without hesitation she gave me everything I needed and I appreciated that so much. She made my experience amazing and she also put my bib on which I thought was funny. When I asked her refill my water and bring me a lid to go she offered to get me a new cup as well. 100% will be returning and asking for her to be my server. 10/10 would recommend to anyone I know. Thank you so much, Jennifer!",

I LOVE, LOVE ME SOME SEAFOOD and they prepared it perfectly with the right amount of yummy seasoning and their kick ass sauce flavors - Oh My! Started our order with juicy Cajun seasoning, medium spice level, 2 lbs shrimp, 1 lb Black mussels, 1 lb of king crab legs, potatoes, rice, corn and sausage. Oh how I wanted to order more, but there wasn't a microwave in our room for any leftovers. Nonetheless, we were stuffed and happy to go walk it off a bit lol. While we were sitting there, letting the food settle, we all had a laugh as we looked around and noticed everyone wearing over gloves to eat as we were looking at our messy, saucy hands waiting to waddle to the hand washing stations. I mean, we're Pacific Islander and we do eat with our hands, so maybe with that observation, we weren't offered those over gloves lol. No worries, didn't need them anyways ha! Thank you Hot N Juicy Crawfish for an amazing dinner! See ya next time :p",

Jeff the person who seemed like manager at the time offered us different varieties of drinks and desserts! Ivy was very kind and accommodating! Saivon was very articulate with the menu and recommended we try the deep fried brownies! and the bartender Michael oooh weee, spectacular conversation and good recommendations of drinks, the huckleberry was to die for! In all a very warm and welcome place to eat at me and my wife will definitely dine in when we come back to Las Vegas!",

The food then came out very quickly!  The boils here are not exactly NOLA but it comes very close in terms of the flavor. Yesterday I got 1 lb of garlic butter shrimp (medium spice), 1 lb of Hot N Juicy flavor (all of the flavors mixed) snow crab (medium spice), and 1 lb of fresh Cajun flavored crawfish (medium spice). They were all SO good! I can't even say which flavor was better. We also added corn and potatoes, and our server hooked it up with an extra corn (which may have been a mistake but I'll take it). This was also the only Cajun restaurant I've been to that hands out gloves to the customers to peel the boils - super convenient for us.  The 3 pounds was $56 total... pretty spendy compared to the south. But I'm from Oregon and nothing there tastes as good so I'd definitely come back every time I'm in Vegas!",

I have an allergy to crawfish and shrimp, but can eat crab.  At the DC location I make them aware of my allergy and they assure me that they can accommodate me.  Well, in Las Vegas they tell me that they cannot accommodate my allergy and that EVERYTHING is cross contaminated, including the fried foods (like a basket of fries would be fried in the same grease as the calamari...gross!).  In DC, I have eaten there numerous times and never had that issue.  But today, while my friends enjoyed all their food I had to sit and wait until they finished to get another food option.  I would assume that the chains would have the same policy to accommodate customers (literally, just not boil in the same water) but I wasn't afforded that with 6 other paying customers. Not a great experience and will not be returning.  Such a small request but they were not willing to accommodate while another location will, I'm confused.",

Make sure you ask them everything u need at one time so u wouldn't have to wait for extra order. The front lady was nice, i could tell they're all tired so i guess they don't smile that much anymore which is understandable! hahah the servings of the shrimps and sauces were even, which is so nice atleast i didn't ran out of sauce.",

There's a giant staircase blocking a clear view of the front door and there is no one tending to the guests walking in. It's like it's only wait staff that are busy with tables.   I ordered 3 lbs of crawfish. I like the traditional, boiled, Louisiana crawfish flavoring so I got it \"Louisiana at medium.\" Perfect amount of spice for what I wanted to have. It was a slow burn and by the last lb, my lips were on fire. Definitely wouldn't want to try spicy. I like to enjoy my food and not suffer too much.   It was very expensive at $15/lb of crawfish. The combos with shrimp are cheaper, but then you end up getting a lot of filler in your bag with a dozen sausages, handful of potatoes, and a few corn on the cobs. I wanted to keep it to all the crawfish.   The sinks outside the bathroom are nice. No need to wait in line just to wash your hands before and after you eat.   Delicious food. The only bad thing about this restaurant is lack of dedicated hostess to seat customers as they come in.",

Calamari is yummy but I recommend getting the Cajun version as the plane version was bland. However, be warned - the Cajun flavoring here is quite hot! Being brown, I'm accustomed to high spice levels however the Cajun with medium spice had my nose leaking. Glad I didn't get spicy. Waiters are extremely friendly and it's in a good location.",

My brother sent back his shrimp for being too hard and my sister in law ate half of a poorly seasoned catfish po'boy. My stomach has hurt since I left.   Tip: Bellagio has $37.99 buffet- all you can eat crab legs that are perfectly prepared.  Do yourself a favor. DONT GO!   (Typed from my bathroom)",

The spices used to their seafoods were the best I ever had - hot, spicy, juicy and garlic flavorful. I ordered their least  spicy level and it was great. Imagine if I get the best one? It will definitely be super hot and yummy!  The fun of this dining experience even though they provided plastic hand gloves, you could eat with your bare hands. How cool is that !   The location is convenient to mass transit. I heard that they normally line before getting seated. Luckily on this night , we were seated right away.    Highly Recommended .",

He gave me the check while I was half in. I was pissed. No apologies for bringing the check early, or anything.   I recommend going somewhere else for better service.

We ordered some of everything. Shrimp, king snow crab, regular crab legs, catfish platter, mussels. It was all yummy. Everyone enjoyed their food and were sufficiently satisfied. Sometimes you can get seafood and eat all your food and still be hungry. The portions are huge. Most ppl in my party ordered multiple things...like an order shrimp and an order of crab legs. I had the mussels and catfish platter. I wanted lobster but they were out. I was disappointed but my food was delicious so I'll just have to get it next time. The prices are fairly decent as well. Decent for a typical meal on the strip but also decent for the type of food. I think the prices were comparable or even less than what you would pay at a crab boil spot at home. I definitely highly recommend this place. The one downfall was they were out of crackers especially for the long snow crab eaters. They complained that it really hurt their hands opening the crab with their bare hands. A must visit for a lunch or dinner option while you're in Vegas.",

The entrance is off the strip, around the corner from the McDonald's. So keep an eye out for it! It is a pretty big location, two floors so lots of seats. They don't take reservations at night, first come first serve.  The clams, shrimp, and snow crab is great, my favourite go to. Hot n juicy and garlic butter are the sauces I always go to, and I like a good kick so I like at least a medium spice. Clams and mussels are only by lbs, just remember that when you order. If you like Cajun food and lazy to go off strip, this is definitely the spot!",

We started with crispy pork skins, calamari, and corn fritters. All were good but I'd definitely order the corn fritters again. The dipping sauce served with them was yummy. We shared a pound of medium spiced crawfish, but I can't remember the seasoning. This isn't the place if you aren't ready for messy eating. I don't like messy, finger eating foods but I was a Louisianan for more than ten years so I knew what to expect. They give you huge plastic bibs and gloves to combat the messiness though. This was a great experience. I haven't had crawfish in years, and it was a delight to have such a great Cajun meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "Just wow. If anyone has ever been to New Orleans and appreciates creole food, Hot N Juicy at Planet Hollywood is THE place to go if you're trying to get your Cajun seafood fix!   The etouffe here literally tastes like it was made straight from the bayou and served at your table. So flavorful and has a nice kick of spice... and I'm not really into spicy foods. But this is just the right amount. PS - if you don't know what etouffe is, it resembles a sort of gumbo-like dish. It's amazing.  The regular fried calamari was really good and comes with a side of marinara and lemons. We were hesitant to order the Cajun calamari because it's a little on the spicier side.  I was afraid that the pound of shrimp with a mixture of all sauces (aka it's called the Hot N Juicy sauce) with baby spice was going to be too spicy for me. But baby spice was great. My heart was happy. PS - there's different sauces you can choose from like garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun, etc. or you might as well throw them all together and savor the flavors.",

Someone else delivered our food. We had not seen our waitress again, but they only delivered HALF of what we ordered. I had to get up and walk to the bar, because I STILL had not seen my waitress. I found her, let her know we were missing food and sat back down. Someone else brought the rest of our order a few minutes later. Our waitress never refilled our water, I had to ask someone else for gloves and crab crackers.   As far as flavor goes, it was meh. The crawfish was frozen and small. We ordered a pound of crab legs as well, and got 3 legs. Now, I am not a chemist or anything, but I knew that wasn't a pound.  The potatoes were cold in the center. Corn was soggy.

A person in my group ordered fries and they never came out. Upon waiting over 20 minutes for crab legs, still none. We asked the waitress and she said our order was cancelled due to one of the other couples cancelling something on their order. WHAT?! We were all on separate tabs. What does one person cancelling have to do with the rest of our separate orders? Not only that, she had just cancelled after the fact we had been waiting for 20 minutes.

I'm so glad we came here because it was so tasty! We split the \"get your feet wet\" which came with 1 lb Crawfish, 1 lb Shrimp, dozen Andouille Sausages,  2  Corns and 2 Potatoes. We ordered it with the hot and juicy seasoning and the baby spice for the spice level. It was absolutely fantastic! The spices were on point and the flavors were awesome! We also split a shrimp po boy which was probably the best po boy I've ever had. I already can't wait to come back!",

They don't go light on the garlic so expect a garlic explosion! But I love garlic so it was perfect for me. Whether it's authentic or not, it was simply delicious!!   They were out of fresh crawfish so we ended up with frozen. Would not recommend it. The meat was almost shriveled from being frozen and the flavor was really not there. Mussels (green) are worth trying however. But for the best bang for the buck, go for the shrimp! Corn is always tasty, the sausage was too salty. Definitely appreciated the add on rice on the side.",

Their shrimp here is a big issue. Before you could even peel the head off it disintegrates as you pick it up. There were only a handful of shrimp in my bag that weren't too bad. Majority of the shrimp they served had the texture of soft tofu which meant their shrimp were not fresh one bit. Some even had a slight texture of mashed potato. Not only did I have this issue with my shrimp the other person in my party did as well.   The sauce was quite liquidity. Did not hold much flavor as compared to other seafood boil spots I've been to. It had very few bits of garlic, probably less than half a spoonful in the entire bag. The flavor I ordered was Hot N Juicy, I had an expectation of having all the flavor in one and was quite disappointed.",

We decided to check out Hot N juicy Crawfish. The menu includes a market price on several different seafood items such as snow crabs, king crab, blue crab, shrimp, crawfish, mussels and many more. We got the shrimp, black mussels, crawfish, fried catfish, sausage and corn. Once items are selected, step 2 is select sauce, we were told the best is to mix all the sauces together, garlic Parmesan, lemon pepper and a buffalo like sauce. Next is spice level. We got hot which was nose running hot but not unbearable. The shrimp (head on) were huge!! Almost prawn like! The mussels excellent, crawfish so big we were amazed (and I've been to NOLA), corn juice, sausage so good. We couldn't pick a better place to get out last Vegas meal. We finished the night with a 1.6lb whole main lobster. It was like having dessert, sooo unbelievably good. Please, please check this place out on your next Vegas trip. I promise you won't be disappointed. We certainly were not!  Couldn't take many photos bc it's quite messy to eat. Gloves and bibs are provided!",

The calamari was rubbery and difficult to chew. I wouldn't order that again. The corn fritters taste like they deep fried creamed corn. It was surprising sweet but delicious.    For the entree we got the 1lb snow crabs, shrimp 1lb, sausage, corn. We got the hot n juice at baby spice level. That was perfect for spice us. It was delicious. Honestly if you are sharing with 2 and both love crab legs I'd get the 2lb with 1/2 shrimp. The price was fair. It wasn't cheap but that should be a given with seafood.   Service was prompt. We were seated and eating rather quickly especially for a Sat evening. I'd definitely recommend this place!",

(The walk was only 5 minutes from my hotel).  Amazingly on a Saturday night, the place wasn't as packed busy as I feared. It had a nice steady busy pace. Someone greeted us when we got in and said it would be a five minutes wait (there were three of us). It was less than that. We were seated on the second floor.  I ordered rice and shrimps with Hot 'n Juicy sauce, spicy. I shared the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" meal with another person. You definitely needed your gloves to eat these yummies! I went through three pairs since the shells keep poking holes. There were juices in my gloves each time.  The \"Get Your Feet Wet\" came with a pound of shrimp, a pound of crayfish, 10? slices of sausages, 2 corns, and 2 potatoes. The sausages were okay. They were sliced diagonally and bite size pieces? Not a fan of the sausages since there were the shrimps and crayfish. Next time I will order the crayfish only. I finished the one pound by myself.  The rice wasn't consistent with the texture. It tasted like someone didn't know how to use the rice cooker and didn't put enough water. There would be some part that is fully cooked and other part where it wasn't fully cooked. It didn't bother me since the juices from the crayfish was so good. I need my rice so I will order again.  Overall, staff were friendly and the food tasted great. Will definitely stop by again before heading home!",

The asian Cajun here is onpoint! Service was great, quick and fast. Place is kind of hard to find tho, I walked around the whole mall trying to find you, but it was worth it. The sign is so high up I could not see. The catfish was juicy and big. Worth the price, I don't remember what the chicken wings taste like tho. I don't think it was rememberable. Probably would not get that again, but the corn nuggets were great! I wanted to try the spring mountain location but it was like an hour wait, so ended up going somewhere else. I will be back in Las Vegas to try the other location of Hot N Juicy! FANTASTIC FOOD!!!!",

Everything seemed to start off to a good start when our server took our order but after that it just went downhill from there.   First of all, it took FOREVER for our food to come and we had to ask for everything multiple times. Half of our table got their food like 30 minutes later and the other half like 40 minutes later... The worst part about this experience was the fact that my boyfriend and I had to ask 4 different servers, several different times for a cracker for the crab legs. One of our friends had to literally walk downstairs and ask the counter for one. This was just truly ridiculous because not only did I have to wait forever for my food, once I got my food I couldn't even eat it.   My friends also asked for water refills multiple times and we never got anything. Once it was time to pay, we noticed that our server put our cards down on a counter and forgot about it for 15 minutes. She only remembered once we made eye contact with her. What should have been a quick one hour meal turned into a over two hour shit show.   The food was honestly just mediocre.. the shrimp was super hard to peel because the shell was stuck. This usually means they used old shrimp.   Overall, I would steer clear of this place. There are SOO many other places on the strip with delicious food and much better service. Don't waste your time!",

    "text": "Summary: Tasty food, but service for upstairs dining was not great. The etouffee was excellent, but they didn't have the fresh crawfish (only frozen). Expect a little bit of a wait if coming during the evening on a weekend. A fun meal if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.  My wife had been to the Washington DC Hot 'N Juicy earlier this year and had a blast with the food and experience. As a result, when she saw one was located just outside of our Elara abode she said we had to check it out for dinner. We went on a Saturday evening at around 8pm and the restaurant was full up with a wait. After about 10 minutes we were taken upstairs and seated.  Our server gave us a rundown of the menu and indicated that they didn't have any of the fresh crawfish available (what my wife was most excited to have). We perused and decided what we wanted, then waited for her to return to our table upstairs. Throughout the meal we had to usually wait a while to be visited, or even had to flag down other servers if they happened to be in the area since the majority of diners were downstairs. We also had to ask for gloves, silverware, etc instead of them just being offered or provided. Kind of annoying.  We ended up ordering a half pound of snow crab legs, the etouffee, and a pound of shrimp with some potatoes and corn, prepared spicy with the Hot N Juicy seasoning. The food was very good and was enough for the two of us with some leftovers of the etouffee to take back to our room. The price is certainly on the high side for most of the shellfish, but the quality was good and everything tasted good. We managed to stay clean by using the gloves and utensils (which definitely got messy), but the meal was fun and enjoyable overall.",

    "text": "My first experience at Hot & Juicy Crawfish is one that does not make me want to come back on my next visit to Vegas.  It is not because of the mediocre food, it is because of the absolutely terrible service.  Your options are a couple of different types of sauce with your seafood or crawfish cook/boiled in plastic bags, then served on your plastic covered table and peeling your selections.  Half of the mussels and clams did not open but trying to get a server to discuss it, was next to impossible.  Maybe they were understaffed on that night but two of my colleagues ordered the lobster that took almost forty minutes at a cost of $50 each.  The highlight to me was the side of rice I ordered with some Hot and Juicy sauce on the side.  I don't want to sound cheap but after dropping a fair amount of money, being charges $2.00 for a side of sauce seems insulting.",

    "text": "I went to the Hot N Juicy Crawfish on Harmon adjacent to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops for lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  I love \"mudbugs\" and Hot N Juicy had long been on my Vegas and DC \"to do\" lists.  They offer a lot more besides crawfish, but I went for what I was craving, a pound of crawfish ($14.95) with Hot N Juicy seasoning.  I believe March is right in the middle of crawfish season, so I was willing to pay a little more for live crawfish vice frozen.  Not being familiar with Hot N Juicy and their definition of spiciness, I played it safe and went with the medium spice level.  I washed it down with my new favorite beer, Joseph James Citra Rye American Pale Ale, which they had on tap.      In truth, crawfish is an acquired taste as it's extremely messy to eat and there's a lot of work for the relatively small payoff of in terms of crawfish tail meat.  It becomes an even smaller payoff if you aren't into sucking the heads.  In short order, I received a plastic bag filled with a pound of whole crawfish bathed in the Hot N Juicy sauce.  The Hot N Juicy sauce was delicious and the medium had plenty of heat (I'll admit it worked up a little sweat on my brow) without overwhelming the delicate flavors of the crawfish meat.  It was good and messy.  Thankfully, they provided a bib.  Like I said, crawfish isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind getting messy (probably not the place to go if you're wearing a suit, or white or light colored clothing), then Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a great choice to get your mudbug fix.",

    "text": "The manager Eve Rodriguez is rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional! We ordered 6 pounds of shrimp and only 5 came out. We waived down several waiters and told them we haven't gotten our last pound. About an hour after waiting, we had to get up and stand at the kitchen until we got our last pound of shrimp... after our party was already done eating, the last  person was left to eat alone once their food finally came out over an hour and a half after the other orders. That individual was also charged for an extra drink that wasn't ordered nor received when our bill finally came out after 10 minutes of waiting for the check. We asked them to remove the extra drink charge and comp the meal, but instead the manager decides to tell us there's nothing he can do for us. After talking, he agreed to 25% off. This is HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PART OF THE MANAGER!!! Hope the owner & management talk to their workers and learn that the customer is always right, especially if they have them wait an hour and a half for food when the restaurant is only at half capacity. (On a side note, there was also another party that had to wait 2 hours for a missing item from their order) But at least the food was good?",

We originally started \"light\" with 1Lb of King Crab and 1/2 Lb of shrimp but ended up enjoying our meal to the point where we had to have more. Even though we were rushing to catch a show, we could not resist ordering another round of the very flavorful crab in the Hot N Juicy seasoning with some corn fritters on the side. The seasoning is sooo good that you will want to sop it all up with everything in site. Awesome place to go if you like seafood with a kick! Yum!",

Luckily our server was very friendly and told us quickly as we sat down that they were out of fresh crawfish and had been for the last week ( we walked 2 miles in 115 degrees to eat fresh crawfish here)but what I want to know is why did the girl on the phone tell me that they had it before we walked all the way down there? luckily our server was very friendly and told us quickly as we sat down that they were out of fresh crawfish and only had frozen, they had been for the last week. The server did offer us a free drink and a sample of the frozen crawfish for our time which was nice but man this was a disappointment I was really looking forward to getting to try this place I guess it wasn't all it was cut out to be",

(And other locations) Our servers, Micha and Miranda, were so attentive to our needs and made sure everything was perfect. The food is hot, delicious, and juicy! And the manager Dan was so pleasant and answered all of our questions the best he could... My boyfriend and I even have places in mind that NEED a Hot N Juicy, and would love to be apart of the franchise. If only they were everywhere!!! Their sauces are phenomenal and can't be replicated... I've never had anything like it anywhere else... It is to DIE FOR. And even if you aren't the biggest fan of hot foods, there is always baby spice! Hands down the best seafood place in the world, and I'm from Alaska (where there's fresh seafood galore.)

They have marinara sauce (thank goodness). I got a half pound of shrimp, lemon pepper, baby spice with a corn added and a side of rice. My boyfriend got a pound of crawfish, hot n juicy, medium with two corns on the side, one plain and one in the sauce.   Their service was great and they always checked up on us. They gave you a bib and gloves once you sit down. They had specials that night, $2 coronas and $5 margaritas which were definitely worth it! I like the location since it's on the strip and open late.  If ever you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for that shrimp or crawfish fix, hot n juicy is the way to go!  They allow outside drinks. *two thumbs up*",

My friend and I were greeted at the door and the host said that he would have to check with his manager to see if we were allowed in with our swim attire.  My friend had on a full cover up and a cardigan. I myself had on shorts and a cover shirt. I saw a sign that said guests must be covered if wearing swimwear, so I understood his stance. But c'mon dude, you clearly see us dressed. We didn't have any of our \"lady parts\" hanging out.   Onto the food, we decided to try the \"get your feet wet\" option since it was our first time trying this place. And I figured this was a good deal since it had 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, corn, and potatoes! I figured since crawfish was $14/lb and shrimp was $16/lb, I was getting quite a deal for $36. We ordered it with the HOT N JUICY seasoning MEDIUM spice level. We also ordered sweet potato fries ($7) because my friend LOVES to soak them in the seasonings and it that way. I was pretty excited given that it sort of reminds me of Houston with the decor and the way the food came out in plastic bags.   When our food arrived, it was piping hot and smelled amazing! I was ready to dive in and divulge. I went straight for the crawfish. The size was SMALL/MEDIUM mixes, definitely no large sizes. As I pulled apart the tail, I realized the meat either looked overcooked or it was frozen. Pleassseee tell me it's not frozen. PLEASE... IT WAS FROZEN!! I was bamboozled. I felt so betrayed. No where did it say on the menu that it was 1 lb of frozen crawfish, which is only $10/lb and it's something I would never pay for. I have been eating crawfish for over 15 years to know this is FROZEN CRAWFISH. The texture was rubbery, the meat stale, it was a brownish color instead of the opaque pink. The \"brains\" in the head was not \"suckable\" at all. I was highly disappointed in this place so far.   Then I went towards the shrimp, which were a pretty big size and they left the head on for you. For those who are shrimp fans like me, I tend to suck on the head too. Since these shrimps were big, I knew the head was juicy. And I wasn't wrong! The shrimp was AMAZING. I absolutely loved it. It wasn't overcooked or soggy, it was perfectly boiled and the seasoning made it 10x better.   Since the crawfish was frozen and never disclosed, I would rate it 1/10. Nothing about the crawfish made me want to finish the rest of it. Since the shrimp was super juicy and sweet, I rate it a 10/10. You can't go wrong with the shrimp in my opinion. The sweet potato fries were standard, nothing special. They were thinly sliced, not thick cut. So this gets a 6/10. The service was a lacking a bit. We ran out of water at one point and kept having to look for our waiter, which is anyone because they sort of help one another out. Then we had to flag down someone for our check. My friend had her credit card ready to go bc we were on a time crunch to head to a show that night. They didn't come get the check from us, so we had to bring it to the cashier area. Service gets a 3/10.   Overall, I would say to order each item by the pound. Don't get the combo deals because you will never know what you'll get. Also, ask for the size of their crawfish before ordering. $14/lb for small is quite unacceptable in my opinion. Ask for a pitcher of water if they provide it because you won't find your server again for a while.",

Add a beer plus a shot each and we had a party going! (It's Vegas!) Lol. Our bill came out to about $80 with tip and it was truly money well spent. I'm definitely coming back!",

I have been to this restaurant on and off the strip and have never been disappointed. You can order a number of things in a bag with great flavor combinations. The staff is friendly and very attentive. As I drink for low they were always right there to refill. They checked on us a few times throughout our meal to ensure we were satisfied. The only reason I give it 4/5 is because I've had better. But that isn't a knock to this restaurant. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for seafood on the strip.",

Hubbs wanted Ginger Ale, but they didn't have any so our server mixed Coke with Sprite...and guess what, it actually tasted very similar to Ginger Ale (minus the ginger). Who knew?    Ok so Hubbs ordered a Shrimp Po' Boy and I ordered catfish with Cajun fries. The server recommended that I have the fish fried crispy and I'm glad that I did. The food was good and really inexpensive. Our food total was $30 and we were full. The shrimp po' boy was a decent size and had plenty of shrimp. The fried catfish was seasoned perfectly and came with a heap of fries.   We had to skip the shelled seafood because having braces and eating shelled crab/crawfish don't mix unfortunately. But several ppl around us really seemed to enjoy it!",

And service was fast and friendly. There's ample seating and even a second story loft so no wait!  We ordered an assortment of food both visits:  Seafood boils - shrimp, lobster, live crawfish, clams. All seasoned Hot & Juicy, Hot. Perfectly seasoned, garlic-y, and right amount of spice. Seafood was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet. Only complaint is that lobster comes  whole, and you have to work to get the meat.  Fried foods -  cajun fries, cajun calamari, corn fritters - fries and fritter were good, calamari was a bit salty, but not bad.  Mouth is watering just thinking about it again.",

I just don't like leaving a food place, smelling like the food for the next week or so.  This location, totally different.  We ordered the feast. Crab, crawfish, shrimp, potatoes, corn, and sausages. The works.  We got mild spice and the hot n juicy flavoring.  It also came with Cajun calamari.  Everything was awesome.  Honestly, we could've eaten more. That's how good.  We got to a good level of full.  This meal states it's good for 4 people, but if you haven't eaten all day, I'd say 1-2 people. I probably could've eaten it by myself.  The servers were kind. We sat at the booth near the door, and we had no complaints. It was like our own little spot, away from the loud people on the inside.  Food. Awesome. Service. Great. Five stars all the way.",

Ten minutes pass, still no food. We ask the waiter to check on her food. They bring her a bag that wasn't even for her. It was for the table next to us. Obviously, she was angry since she was hungry and everyone else was about to finish. They finally bring her food out. At this point she was very irritated.

    "text": "I'm so glad they opened up this location on the strip (located around the corner of Planet Hollywood, next to Buffalo Wild Wings, and past the walkway bridge) so we don't have to uber, lyft or drive to Spring Mountain Blvd for their other two locations over there.   This is our must go to everytime we visit Las Vegas and we come here atleast 2 times on our trip (1 when we arrive and 1 before we leave). This trip was no exception and since it was so close to our hotel (Planet Hollywood) too bad we didn't stay longer since the only place we ate in our two nights here were 2 other places and Hot N Juicy twice!  Food:  I've been to 3 of their Las Vegas locations now and they all have been consistently the same. The Hot n Juicy sauce is the best i've had out of all the crawdad places like this i've been. The sauce is garlicky, thick enough to stick to the meat and shell but not too thick that it has a goopey texture. The spice levels are on point along with the flavors without it being too oily from the butter.   The Lousiana style was on point as well. No, it's not as thick as the Hot n Juicy but, it still doesn't skip out on the flavor of Lousiana. It's watery but, the juices gets all up inside of the meat and just bathes it in incredible authentic tasting Cajun juice that brings me back to my grandparents days when they made their seafood boil (they're from Lousiana and Georgia).   This time around I got 1lb of crawfish and 1lb of blue crab. This time around the blue crab was really meaty and larger than last time i came at their other 2 location and they still came in a pair only instead of a male and female like my previous experience, this time it came in with 2 males (on both visits this trip). But, we ended up getting a pleasant surprise. Since they were celebrating their anniversary, if you order a lb of blue crab you get a extra blue crab for free.   When we first came here we didn't know that and told the server that we didn't order those crabs and our waitress went back to talk to the person who took our order and came back explaining their deal. Guess what too.. both times the extra crab were female with eggs (YES!).  End food review  The staff are consistently friendly and attentive. The food is quality and the price is perfect. You just can't go wrong with any of the Hot n Juicy locations.   Please open one up in the Bay Area. Thank you :D",

    "text": "These are really big back home (DC) so I decided to try this location while vacationing with friends. I ordered a whole Dungeness crab and a half pound of shrimp. The shrimp came first and were perfect. When the crab arrived to the table, it was hot and seasoned. Now here's where the issue comes in. This 1.8 pound crab was completely over cooked. The body of the crab was completely mushy. The legs just made it out as some of them were mushy too. I noticed this after eating a few legs and attempting to eat the body. I could not eat it. It was like hot over cooked crab soup! I informed my waitress of the situation with the crab and she informed me that a manager would come and speak to me. I saw my waitress at least 5 more times before she returned to inform me that her manager who I later learned was named Brittany said that the crab was ok as long as the legs weren't over cooked there was nothing they could do about the body being over cooked and inedible. She stated that her manager said she could take the shrimp I did eat off the bill but not this crab I couldn't eat. I asked my waitress to please have the manager come and say that to me. Frankly it's absurd and I didn't believe a manager in any capacity would say such a thing to a paying customer. (Oh sorry you can only eat half your food, but we definitely expect you to pay in full.) The Manager Brittany tried to actively avoid our table. Once she stopped at our table she stated that she was already aware of the situation and also appeared inebriated. I informed her that what she asked the waitress to tell me in regards to the crab being ok because the legs were cooked was unacceptable. I also informed her that it is very possible to cook a Dungeness crab correctly with the body and the legs cooked properly. Brittany the manger then proceeds to tell me to \"chill\" cause she was returning from a break and didn't really know what happened? (Not what she said when she finally arrived.) Brittany then proceeds to ask me what my problem is and why I'm being so rude to her. At this point all I have asked is what the solution is to this inedible crab. This woman is rude, aggressive, and just all around has a horrible attitude to be the manager of this establishment. I am beyond angry and offended at the way I've been treated, so much so that before a resolution was offered I excused myself and left the venue and returned to my hotel. I've never been treated so horribly in my life in a restaurant. Brittany who by the way was on another \"break\" when I left should be nowhere near management. It was almost as if she had no working knowledge of what she was supposed to do or how a manager should behave. The other guests in my party were also taken aback by her level of rudeness and complete lack of even basic customer service skills. I wont ever eat at this location again, and it's a shame because this was my first time ever in one of your restaurants and I'm almost sure I won't be returning based of this experience.",

    "text": "It's another Boiling Crab copy cat except they include Po Boys, and a few other deep fried seafood items that you wouldn't have otherwise found at a Boiling Crab. Truth be told, I don't actually remember the location of this place. I just know that my group and I were walking down the Las Vegas Strip to the Buffalo Wild Wings and upon arriving there and being told that the wait time will be 1 hour and 45 minutes, we were like \"Yea....no. Let's go somewhere else.\"  Hot N Juicy Crawfish just happened to have been right next to the Buffalo Wild Wings. When we got there and asked for the wait time, the waitress said that there was no wait and our group of 5 can immediately go in and sit down, it was no brainer that we ended up eating here.   It's like a medium-sized establishment. The first floor can probably seat something like 30-40 people at any given time. The 2nd floor can probably seat an additional 20 people at any given time and that's ultimately where we ended up at.   Restrooms are on the first floor and in the far right back corner from the entrance. Seemed clean enough and smelled clean enough. Enough said.  Ambiance. This place was literally set up for groups. It was loud. I believe there was music in the background and there were TV's mounted on all sides of the wall but the volume was turned down and tuned into primarily sports channels. Brightly lit, clean, and on the walls hung rather interesting portraits of, I guess, the history of this spot.   Price. It's about the same as a Boiling Crab and all their copy cats. Meaning, roughly in the $15 and up range. I think the highest priced item was the crabs, which was, I think $23 bucks at the time we were there. They go by the market price for the \"better seafood items\" while the shrimp, crayfish, and I think the green and black mussels were all in the $15-16 for 1 pound range.   Service was consistently good and didn't mess up our order so A+ all around on that front.   I personally ordered a Fried Shrimp Po'Boy, which comes with a side order of fries, 1 pound of black mussels (which I got jipped, btw), and iced water. Frankly, I forgot what sauce options are available for when you order the seafood items but I went with a mild sauce and interesting enough, they allow you to pick the seasoning so I chose Lemon Pepper, if I recall correctly. My friends went with their usual half pound of shrimp, potatoes, crayfish, crabs, sausage, and all at their favorite level of spicy, which was definitely hotter than mine.   If I had to say it, I felt like they could have given more food, given their price tags. The 1 pound of black mussels I got was predominantly empty shells. I think about half of it was empty shells while the other half actually had mussel meat. Even then, the black mussel meat was definitely a lot smaller than what I'm accustomed to. Maybe the black mussels that this restaurant sourced from are just naturally smaller than the one's sold in California? I guess we will never know at this point. The Fried Shrimp Po'Boy was good though. I liked it a lot. It's basically a burger with fried shrimp. Fries was fine. Nothing to write home about on that. It tasted as it should.    All in all, it's A-Ok. Not the best I've had but certainly not the worst either. I've eaten at Boiling Crab (not a fan), Star Crab, which is a copy cat (liked this one a lot better), and this spot and between the three, I still prefer Star Crab. Nevertheless, I'd still recommend giving this place a shot.",

    "text": "Absolutely enjoyed this place! My group & I stayed at the Elara Hotel and decided to walk around and happened upon Hot n Juicy Crawfish which is located on the outside of Planet Hollywood. It was Super Bowl Day and Buffalo Wild Wings were charging $60 to watch the game. So we ended up here instead. Our waitress, Mary, was very sweet & patient with us. We were pretty rowdy due to the game and it was everyone's first time but Mary explained the menu & recommended her favorites;  she recommended the combos which are great for sharing & she also told us that they had a Super Bowl BOGO beer special so you know my group and I constantly had something to chug down with our food. For the ladies of our group Mary recommended the Huckleberry cocktail. So we opted for 2 of the Get Your Feet Wet; 1lb shrimp, 1lb crawfish w/ corn, potatoes & sausages w/ their signature Hot n Juicy sauce. Being first-timers Mary gave everyone a quick tutorial on how to peel a crawfish. Delicious! Everything came in a clear bag and it gets pretty messy but are provided with bibs & gloves. You're also given lemons with salt & pepper to dip your seafood in. And to make our dining experience better the Patriots won! Again, shout out to our waitress Mary for being extremely patient with us especially with us screaming at the TVs. We appreciate you!  We will definitely be back!",

You can also go with a pre-selected feast that includes corn, sausage, and potatoes. We opted to order by the pound, and got shrimp, crawfish, and blue crab. Sauced it up with garlic butter and mild spice (still definitely some heat with the mild! ). All choices were soooo good. I should also mention that the fried calamari we shared is the best I've had. It was perfect! You're definitely gonna get messy here so they give you bibs and gloves to help keep you from looking like you just swam in a vat of cajun butter, as delicious as THAT sounds.

    "text": "Very attentive staff and the crawfish boil was one of the best I've had!! I got 3 pounds of crawfish all to myself. They were big, had lots of the yellow stuff (fat) in the head which means the crawlfish are nice and plump! I was surprised at how fresh the crawfish was! Out of the 3 pounds, I only found maybe 3 that tasted past it's prime like gutter/sewer. I got the juicy Cajun seasoning and because some of the fat got boiled out of the crawlfish, it made the seasoning extra juicy! The Cajun seasoning was a bit sweet so if you don't want the sugar then I suggest you just go with the regular old bay style seasoning. I got spice level 3 and wish I got spice level 2 because 3 had some kick to it. I choked a couple times and had to chug water when I accidentally sucked spicy juiced towards the back of my throat.   I think I even got a discount ($12/pound instead of $16) for getting 3 pounds. I got the andouille sausage added to my boil. They were super tasty!!  I also got corn fritters but I don't recommend them...there was more batter than corn. Ranch dressing as a dip was meh.  Service was on point though. They were bringing me everything from gloves to extra lemons and iced teas refills. I'm very pleased for such quality food and service found on the Strip!! Prices were not too outrageous either.  FYI, this location is outside the Miracle Miles shops. It's part of the mall but to get here you must exit the mall!",

Here is to hoping it was a tough night and it's such a good idea for the area and being from the South I will try it again. It's a great departure from all the stuffy and over the top places on the strip that take themselves so serious.   Location on the outside of Planet Hollywood mall is great.

All were delicious.  Clams were my favorite though.  Soft and perfectly cooked.   Overcooked clams irritate me.  These were perfect and not 1 grain of sand :)  1lb of that shared with my hubs was too little.  I am getting 1lb for myself next time plus another lb of something else!  So happy this is on the strip :)",

It really just depends what location I am closest to. We just so happened to be at PH at the time I was craving shrimp!   Let's get back to the point! The lady upfront, her name is Ashley (Team Lead) was the rudest person I've ever encountered at any Hot N Juicy! First off, I understand you are busy and I understand it is very stressful! BUT DO NOT TELL ME OUR TABLE IS READY and have my family & I sit there for another 20-30 mins after already waiting almost an hour! And DO NOT tell me our table is ready when there is no one even cleaning our table. I had to tell 3 different servers why no one was cleaning the table we eventually got seated at! I eventually asked her why no one was cleaning our table & she responded \"well can't you see we are busy? We are short staff and our kitchen is backed up. I will get to your table in 10 minutes\" WHY WHY WHY tell me our table is ready????!!!!! If you were going to throw in my face that you're short staffed. Finally got a manager and asked her to clean the table because the lady up front told us our table was ready..   I am not one to doubt that they were all probably stressed because of the excessive amount of people there, but that does not give you a right to one give an attitude to your customers. I understand that we were a big party, but we were there before half the people she decided to seat before us! First come first serve right?! We waited over an hour and watched multiple people get seated before us! I am not impressed. I hope one day my opinion will change about this location. Sadly because I am someone's who loves this restaurant and their food! ",

    "text": "By far my favorite place for a taste of savory seafood! To begin, for a party of 2 the wait was a bit longer than anticipated it took around 20-25 minutes. We arrived around 9:45 pm and at that time the place was very much alive and buzzing ( but of course... you're in VEGAS ! ) We sat on the benches along the wall waiting for our table and were given water to compensate for the wait ( how kind :) considering the heat from Vegas ).   TO THE FOOD!!  The two of us shared their \"Get Your Feet Wet\" a combination of 1/2 lb shrimp,1/2 lb crawfish, 2-3 red potatoes, andouille sausages, corn on the cob, and your choice of sauce/ level of heat.   First, the SHRIMP possibly the best cajun shrimp I have ever had. It's texture was so tender and non-mushy/ powdery unlike some other places I've been to. I'm no seafood fanatic, but the shell from the shrimp could easily be peeled and I know that when it's easy to peel it means its been cooked right!  Second, the CRAWFISH. I don't have much to say on this protein because for me there really isn't much in it already, all in all I have no complaints. Third, the RED POTATOES. Also cooked to my liking. It's firm, round shape was still intact as well as the skin. Not too dense, able to eat in bites and perfect balance for the sauce. Fourth, the ANDOUILLE SAUSAGES. Sliced into decent sizes so it's able to give off a smoky aroma and add flavor.  Fifth, the CORN ON THE COB. Also one of the best cob I've had. I'm not cob person, more of the kernels, but I decided to give it a try and was shocked! As I dug my teeth into it, the sweet juice from the individual kernels and the spicy heat from the cajun sauce immediately floods into my mouth. The sauce is embedded in between each kernel so with every bite you get the full taste of sweet and savory.  Sixth, the SAUCE/ HEAT. Trust the menu and your servers when they say it's Spicy, it reallyyy is SPICY they are NOT lying to you! I believe we chose the staple sauce Hot n Juicy, but for our spicy levels we did Medium in the bag and Hot on the side. The sauce truly compliments the entire the meal, it's not too over powering to the point that you can't taste the seafood, corn etc but it adds a nice kick & twist for your tastebuds.   Additional Tips: - don't wear fancy clothes, and if you do wear multiple bibs ( provided ) - not really for kids unless they just want fish and chips - get ready for some dirty hands and possibly forearms",

    "text": "I'll start my first ever yelp review with this location not due to food the food was great. The cause of this review was due to the horrible service from the front of the house. The customer service rendered was terrible and sadly I recommend our party to eat here due to the West Hollywood location in Santa Monica being my favorite place to eat.   Our party of 6 arrived and were greeted by Jasmine the team leader/ hostess who kept up with ETAs until being seated her customer service and the great food is what saved this from becoming a 1 star review.  The wait was approximately 15 minutes.  After being seated our server arrived who never introduced herself to take our drinks orders. Within a minute another server arrived to take our drink orders again for some unsure reason and insisted on taking it again until our first server arrived and delivered drinks.  We ordered our food all 1 pound of shrimp hot and juicy with sides fries and rice. And this is where our dinner spirals into mediocrity. Everyones fries and rice arrived and all but one of our bags of shrimp arrived. We informed our server 3rd or 4th of the night who brought the food who we later found out was the manager Eve Rodriguez that we have a bag of shrimp missing and requested refills. I assumed he acknowledged our complaint with direct eye contact and a nod. When our 2nd server passed we then informed her of our bag of shrimp was missing and requested a refill. Our party began eating so all our food was not cold. Throughout the meal our waiter? waitress? Waitresses? never arrived once to check up on our table. After 30 minutes our group physically went up to our server to remind them of our missing bag of shrimp and for water if they couldnt refill drinks. Our water eventually arrived after 5 minutes. And 15 minutes a total of 45 minutes after our last bag of shrimp arrived after our group was finished eating. Once again a refill was requested heard then ignored. After our last member finished after 30 minutes. We spoke to the last apologetic employee Jasmine who aplogized for the experience but not much could be done.   My friend then spoke to Eve Rodriguez the manager tall hispanic man with a pony tail and informed him our terrible experience. Maybe since it was Vegas or maybe they get complaints constantly he stated he will take 15% off our 3rd parties check as soon as we mentioned one of our party members received his food 45 minutes late and attempted to walk away.  My friend was upset about the unapologetic attitude and disintrested attitude by Eve and threatened to not pay. That seemed to upset Eve which is understandable and he then threatened the whole group threatening to call Security and press charges when 2 groups of our 3 groups already paid which was not ok. After that he finally listened to our complaints compes our 3rd party meal 25%. While exiting another group informed us they have been waiting 2 hours for part of their parties food.   Its odd this occured there were consistently 3 tables open and there was a large party that took 3 tables 20 minutes after us.   Front of the house definitely needs work.",

So looking forward to coming back to this establishment. I hope all the HNJs are the same as far as service and food or else that would be a great disappointment.",

    "text": "I lived in Vegas 5 years ago and was SOO excited to try this restaurant while back visiting. Let's just say that two stars is probably generous. My mother and I both ordered the King Crab Legs and half a lb of shrimp each. We also ordered the corn fritters (which were the ONLY good thing about this $100 meal) and sweet potato fries. The \"jumbo\" crab legs which you get THREE of were soggy and almost impossible to crack. I sent my shrimp back bc the texture was so off putting I was scared I'd get food poisoning. It took me asking FOUR times to get a pair of plastic gloves while all the employees stood around and laughed and joked with each other. Save your money, and if you want good seafood, head over to the Bucchanal buffet at the Caesars, where for the same price you can get unlimited hot AND cold crab legs (that they've graciously cut in half for you already) and amazing shrimp. Do NOT waste your time and money on Hot N Juicy. Huge disappointment.",

We are here for a week and will be going back. The price was decent. I'm a believer that you get what you pay for. I highly recommend this place",
