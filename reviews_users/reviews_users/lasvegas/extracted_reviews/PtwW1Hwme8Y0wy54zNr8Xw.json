Now that we know this restaurant has a dog friendly patio, we are definitely looking forward to coming back along with our furry buddy.",

The fruit was high quality. And the pancakes were super tastey. I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning on the home style taters but they were cooked properly so us just a preferance.   I was happy with th service. Nothing above and beyond, but nothing negative to say either.   The establishment was clean and their batfooms were above average.",

    "text": "The 5th Egg Works location has opened up in Summerlin in the Trails, off of Village Center Drive and Town Center.  The location of the former Maru Korean BBQ restaurant, the site has been transformed into one with ample seating.  I arrived this Saturday morning around 10:30am expecting to wait since the parking lot was packed.  However, my friend was already seated, which was a good thing since we were both starving.  Our waitress, Nohemi, was very friendly and attentive.  As with the other Egg Works restaurants, their menu comes in newspaper format and you'll find the same crepes, omelets, pancakes, waffles, and scrambles.  I was craving pancakes, but also just wanted eggs and bacon, but that simple combo is not available, for some odd reason.  I ended up ordering the Blueberry and Cashew pancake short stack, which is three smaller pancakes (you can also get one huge pancake instead of the short stack), a side of turkey bacon (3 strips), and a side of 2 egg whites.  My friend got the huevos rancheros, which came with breakfast potatoes.  Our food came out in a timely manner considering the place was packed and it's brand new.  For a \"short stack,\" the pancakes were bigger than I expected them to be so I ended up eating only half of them.  Blueberry and cashews together sounded interesting, but I didn't love it; I would probably order a different kind the next time around.  I don't remember what the side order of eggs cost, but the turkey bacon was $3.50.  My meal came to about $14, which is more than I like to spend for what I had, so I don't think I'll be coming here too often.  However, this place is definitely going to give the neighboring restaurants that have been serving the breakfast crowd here a run for their money.",

I understand that the restaurant has just recently opened but i cant say that i'm impressed. The service was slow! I know that during the time of our trip their main customers were the elderly but COME ON! After being seated it took about 20 min before someone came around to take our order. We had to resort to flipping the unhappy egg.   For those of you who don't know, Egg works and Egg and I both use the \"run forest run\" system. They have happy eggs for those who don't need assistance that flip over and reveal an unhappy egg which means you need assistance.   The food wasn't that great either. I had the waffle which was pretty routine, nothing really great or bad to say about it. My girlfriend got the one of the crepes and when i tried it it wasn't that bad. I did drown it in hot sauce but still... it was OK. The worst part of our meal was one of the tostadas. The lettuce used in the tostada was still wet and that caused, what should be a crispy and delicious shell, to become soggy and mushy. The taco meat was over sauced and  that caused the lettuce to wilt as well. Overall the dish was really bad. They were able to take it off of our bill since we only took a few bites from it.",

    "text": "Such a disappointment! We called ahead for a large group of 21 guests. The wait was only 20 minutes. That was the good part. We had one person serving us and taking orders. They put us at 2 tables next to each other, which was fine. Our waitress took one tables order and then left. Came back 10 minutes later and took the other tables order and then left. Table 1 got our good in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes goes by and table 1 is fine eating when table 2 barely gets their food! We turn the happy face to sad and at least 5 staff members walk past without stopping to ask what's wrong. Our waitress finally lolligags over and flips the faces back without asking. So I demanded to understand why half of MY guests didn't have their food. She says she split our order to help the flow of the kitchen. Ok that's fine but a 45 minutes gap is not ok. You could tell she just wanted us to leave by then. I was livid. If my family would have let me I would have not left a tip. None of us will ever return to this restaurant again. Horrible service!!! I should've known this from a few weeks ago when they completely forgot my daughters scrambled egg plate but the food was good so we chalked it up to an oversight and they didn't charge us for her scrambled eggs and toast. Don't waste your time unless you get a good server, which we did not!!!",

So far, so good, handled it well and didnt charge us for these, so i greatly appreciate their service.   The food, however, was not awesome. I ordered the Greek scramble and what i got was a grey, unappetizing mess loaded with some sort of pressed chicken thing. It was slimey, salty and I didnt love it. My man got mushy, NOT homemade corned beef hash which was also unimpressive. With enough hot sauce, the meal was tolerable. Best part was the side of fruit. Like I said, dont do it.",

My dog however is a service dog and can go either place, but I'm happy for the patio as some people, even though she is a service animal get upset when she is \"anywhere\" they are. FYI, Service Animals do not have to wear vests or any kind of ID, so you never know when a dog near you is actually a service animal, although the \"handlers/owners\" do have to carry a handlers ID. Some management ask to see it, some don't, but I always have mine in clear view.  This being said:  Egg Works is Amazing.  Everything I have ever ordered there has been perfect and very delicious. The prices are comparable to other breakfast places in the area.  I can't wait to go back.  The location is somewhat hard to find, but there is an IHop and a Starbucks within eyesight of the patio.  So I guess it gets lots of traffic?   This location used  to be an awesome Korean Restaurant.  Don't know what happened to it, but we ate there all the time.   I highly recommend this Egg Works, and if you don't like dogs...sit inside. :-)",

There wasn't a time where I was sitting there waiting for someone to come by because he was always walking around checking up on every table. My girlfriend and I sat down at a table for two and Curtis was nice enough to push another table together to give us more room knowing these 2 person tables aren't the biggest, he then took our drink orders and food orders. And within a minute he had our drinks and literally another minute passed and out food was already out. I've never had food come out that quick unless I was at a fast food restaurant. Seriously the best server I've had. If you can ask for a certain server when you come here I would choose him, I ensure you you won't be disappointed.",

I've had a lot of chicken fried steak this was fantastic. I swapped out the potatoes for fruit and the toast for a biscuit perfect.

I like the idea of having menus in newspaper form: old-school, yet creative.  I had a chicken enchilada omelette with potatoes and it was absolutely delicious. The addition of salsa and tortilla strips in the omelette were a great addition and added some great texture. The potatoes were seasoned nicely and had a good flavor to them; not much of a \"kick,\" but enough flavor to make them something special.  This place is not too loud, but don't expect any silence; what can you expect from a place that is packed? A great place to have a meal for breakfast or brunch. Too bad this place closes before dinner!",

It's like a needle in a haystack!  But finding this popular breakfast locale was worth it!  Came here with the fam on a Sunday of all days and even in the upper boonies the place was crowded.  Like super crowded!  But thankfully even though many of us had to wait outside, it didn't take Egg Works more than 15 minutes to seat us.  And we got a lovely table on the outside Richie Rich Summerlin air!  Ahhhhhh....breathe in the wealth!  And the occasional fumes of Ferrari's passing by.  It's easy to see why this Egg Works is so busy.  It's basically the only one in this part of town.  Plus it caters heavily to the breakfast/brunch crowd.  Plus, apparently folks actually like the food!  It's got a lot going for it.  Upon being seated we were promptly helped by the wait staff.  Our order:  ME -Original Breakfast Burrito ($9.95) - Flour tortilla stuffed with 4 eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers, Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, cheddar & jack cheese.  Waiter also suggested I add avocado in my burrito (a $2.50 upcharge!!).  Comes with a side of more Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes & Habla Diablo salsa.  WIFEY -Santa Cruz Skillet ($10.99) - bottoms layer of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, topped with seasoned chicken breast, chorizo, green chilies, onions, and home made Santa Cruz sauce (whatever it really is I don't know).  Topped with a dollop of sour cream, melted cheese & 2 eggs over easy.  Also comes with your choice of toast of banana nut muffin (she chose muffin).  KID -Waffle Works ($9.80) - waffle served with 2 eggs any style (over easy), with choice of ham, bacon, or sausage.  Plus with check in on Yelp we got a complimentary banana nut muffin to try!  Food was good but it did take a bit of extra time to come out possibly because we were either on the outside patio or because it was just slammed at Egg Works that day.    My breakfast burrito was definitely hearty, it was huge with the addition of that expensive avocado!  I was only able to eat half, I had to take the other half home for later.  Flavors in the burrito were yummy, fresh scrambled eggs, good quality bacon bits, fresh veggies, spicy potatoes, and more than enough cheese throughout.  Topped with some of their Habla Diablo salsa & house hot sauces this breakfast burrito was pretty top notch!  The side of extra Habla Diablo potatoes are really tasty, seasoned with a nice kick & cooked crunchy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside.    Wifey liked her Santa Cruz skillet very much.  Chicken was grilled but not dry, chorizo & that Santa Cruz sauce gave the dish some extra flavor and a punch of heat.  All that with egg yolk running down?  Oh yeah, yum city baby!    Kid thought the Waffle Works plate was OK.  It really wasn't anything special to write home about, pretty par for the course.  The waffle was a bit cold, and tasted like a basic waffle to her.  It was just alright, but they forgot butter!  So her first bite or 2 were dry.  Bacon & eggs weren't anything special, just bacon & eggs.  We were a bit disappointed with our banana nut muffins though.  I thought they would be brought warm to our table but they were cold.  They could have used a pat of butter as well since they were on the dry side.  So the muffin was somewhat forgettable.  One thing that may bother the value-conscious is the prices here at Egg Works.  For breakfast they be on the high side!  To get a decent meal will cost you near $10 per not including any drinks.  And if you upgrade your burrito like I did with avocado, it will set you back over  $12 not including tax!  But keep an eye out on Groupon, they do promotions for this place often.  With the varied menu at the Egg Works we'll probably be back again.  They do Hawaiian type food here too, get a Loco Moco or some SPAM & Portuguese sausage for breakfast!  We'll be back!  If we don't get lost in a roundabout first.",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast spots.... The works chili is amazing. Anything with it on it and you won't be sorry. I've had the omelette, skillet, and burger with chili and can't decide which one is the best. Those are usually my go-to choices, but I've tried many things before finding my favorites. All of their breakfast food is amazing and the habla diablo potatoes are a can't miss item. Not a big pancake/waffle person, but theirs seem pretty good to me, as I've tried a bite of other's food. It can't get pretty packed on the weekends, but you usually don't end up waiting very long for your food once you've sat down, which is surprising. The only real downside is the wait to be seated on the weekends if you're not willing to sit at the counter (which looks like it's pretty uncomfortable to be smashed in if you're not a smaller person like I am) and also the wait to pay. I wish you could just leave the money on the table because it can get pretty backed up trying to pay. If you're coming in at a time that isn't during their peak hours (weekend mornings I'm assuming) then everything should be smooth sailing. Their prices are okay, just average, but every couple months a Groupon pops up and I grab the maximum amount of them because it's definitely worth it.",

My husband ordered stuffed french toast with strawberries and whipped cream - dessert for breakfast anyone? Let me tell you, this guy for the duration of his meal, was transported to heaven!

Received my free banana, but muffin from yelp.   Ordered OJ, the classic, scrambled eggs, potato's toast and bacon.    My service was fabulous, even though it was extremely busy my server Lisa was very attentive and made sure my first experience at EGG Works was worth coming back   The banana muffin was not very banana based. It did come out warm and moist.   It was very good tasting, but not a banana based muffin.   So my breakfast came out fast and hot.   The eggs, and bacon were good and fresh.  The Potatoes have a good kick to them.  If you do not like spicy, order light or no seasoning.    The restaurant was clean and orderly.    They have a good section for big parties in the back.",

I got a skillet the first time I went and an omelette the second time, and they were both good.   I liked the idea of a sign you flip over if you need help from a waiter or not. That way if we needed something small like napkins (something anyone could get for us, not just our waiter), then someone would look and help us.   If you go to Egg Works, get the banana nut muffin. They're homemade and really good :)   Both time service was great. Had no issues there.   Overall great place and I'm glad I went :)",

The service is still good and parking decent, however, the food is getting sparse.  In the case of the breakfast skillets, they overdo the amount of potatoes, which are overly spiced with salt, and then short change on the other ingredients, chicken, mushrooms, spinach, etc.  I am so disappointed and I have been drinking gallons of water for two days to compensate for the salty potatoes.

The service was very good, but not very prompt, particularly considering how slow it was. The wait people were exceptionally nice, though when we asked about certain dishes, *everything* was \"great!\". I think the pace was indicative of the laid-back clientele.  We got a chicken wrap, fries, chili and drinks. The wrap was good - though certainly not $11 good, the fries were better than average (and raved about by the waitperson), and the chili was, simply, forgettable. In total, yes: meh.

    "text": "So this is a location that I have eaten once before with no real issue, however this time I can't say the same. Our server was pleasant, though not enough to stand out as memorable. That wasn't the issue here, she did nothing wrong. This chain puts a spice on their home fried potatoes that to me makes them way too salty to eat. One time it was so bad that I had to send it back. When you order an item such as a skillet breakfast, they put these potatoes as the bed that the meals items lie on. In turn, the entire menu item tends to become incredibly salty. I tried it, and was rather shocked at the high salt/sodium level. I'm sure they would have been \"ok\" with us sending it back for this reason, but I'm surprised they don't get regular complaints about this. However, this was not even the main issue of our visit. They have an open (non screened,) \"pet friendly\" dine-in patio. We luckily chose to be seated inside the air conditioned restaurant. After we were seated, we noticed a fair amount of pigeons flying around on the patio. They were flying right by diners and even directly over where people were eating. They were flapping their wings, and making their presence known to all the diners that had the misfortune of eating out there. They were landing on the ground and eating food that had made its way to the floor. However, this wasn't even the worst part. A couple left quite a bit over on their plates upon their departure, and three or four of these birds landed on the table and began to chow down on the leftovers. They were standing on the plates (on the table) and really going to town. This continued for about 5 minutes or so, to our disgust. It wasn't until the hostess attempted to seat some more folks out there that they stopped, and they still didn't even fly away. They finally went to clean off the table, and the busser shoo'd them away. Not only was I disgusted, the words UNSANITARY and HEALTH HAZARD were flashing the color red in my head. Pigeons are not real clean members of the aviary family. It was so outlandish in my mind that I took to shooting pics & a video with my cell phone, I just couldn't believe it. I'm all for \"pet friendly\" environments, but this was just sickening to me that it was taken so nonchalantly and carefree. Like a scene out of the movie \"The Birds!\"  A True feeding frenzy! I was sick to my stomach at a distance, if I was unfortunate enough to be eating out there while this was taking place I would have undoubtedly walked out on my meal.  Other things I noticed while there included:  A. My plate was filled with 75% of fried potatoes. Obesity in America is real. I'm all for decent portions but this was seriously beyond a normal serving for one person.  B. The hot sauce on the table says \"refrigerate after opening.\" Do they replace the one on a table after its originally opened? I'm sure not.   C. Waiting to pay at the front, nobody present to take our (or another party's money.) We had to go looking for somebody to man the register.  I have little problem with patio dining normally, but this was a perfect example of how an inexpensive option like a screen would go a long way. To whom it may concern, please do this before somebody ends up sick. I also understand that they don't control said birds, but if this a regular occurrence then the appropriate individual should take notice immediately.  I have eaten in other locations and have had little to no issues, but I'm not sure if this type of thing has ever been experienced by others here before myself. I myself nor whom I was dining with will not be returning.  My visit still gets 3 stars only due to my server wasn't the issue and what I myself ate was fine.  P.S. If anybody needs proof I have pics and a video. I'm not vindictive or I would have posted a pic here today lol.",

Waitress confused me when she asked if I wanted any special creamer... \"uhhh, what?\"  ...but they've got the flavored International Delight stuff hiding in the back. She was cool and left a carafe at the table because obviously I give out the I want a lot of coffee vibe.   The food though, meh. Portions are huge, lumberjacks could eat here! I had eggs Benedict and found the Hollandaise quite salty. I think it's a Las Vegas thing to put olives on top for decoration, nay to that. Boyfriend had \"stuffed French toast\" and we both assumed it would be a more decadent, dessert like dish than a basic egg/sausage scramble French toast sandwich. Oh well. That's what you get for assuming. They don't do hash browns here, rather they have their own sort of country style potatoes. Now these were WELL seasoned, another friend of ours doesn't like to eat at Egg Works because of this. However, we found the potatoes to be the best part of the meal (besides the coffee) We both at half and took the rest home, potatoes heat up nicely in a skillet as leftovers.  Tidbits: There's a neat electric train running around the top of the foyer where you pay. A lot of outdoor seating it appears, but seem to be understaffed and these sections were closed off. Happy/sad egg sign at each table to fetch a server for attention, brilliant idea.  Forgot to use our Yelp check-in offer for a free muffin :(",

The food is exceptional, equally as good as over on Sunset.  This place is very roomy and watching all the staff move around in the performance of their duties is like watching a finely tuned machine - very smooth and efficient.  I spent approximately 7 hours traveling to Summerlin and back again to Henderson on the RTC bus system.  That's how much I treasure Ashley and the food at Egg Works.",

So, my wonderful meal was a half order of the Greek scramble (Swiss cheese, mushrooms, spinach, artichoke, chicken, and topped with a bit of feta. Yummm.  Friending my scramble was sourdough toast with apple jelly, perfectly crisped, unseasoned breakfast potatoes (yeah, not a fan of seasoning on my spuds), fruit, and a sunrise.  Service is always great and Nicole a peach for putting up with a bunch of punchy Gravers after a 10 hour shift. Today was perfect for breakfast on the patio.",

When you walk in it looks like an average size place but once you're fully in the place is pretty big !   They have numerous breakfast choices and unique ones too! I had their special of the day and absolutely LOVED it. Very fast food for sure. The customer service is amazing as well.  The whole staff there seems really nice and attentive to all the guests.   This location is a little hidden but I know they have a few so definitely recommend them if you're in the search for a great breakfast .",

However, we ordered 3 Mouse Pancakes meals for our kids. ALL THREE ORDERS OF PANCAKES WERE COMPLETELY RAW IN THE MIDDLE. And the best part is when then remade all three orders and they all came back over cooked. They gave us two 1/2 off our meal cards to use and told us we wouldn't be charged for the pancakes. BUT they only took 1 pancake meal off our ticket and we could only use 1 of the 1/2 our meal cards! And they wouldn't allow my husband his Military Discount because we used one of the cards. Absolutely ridiculous! We paid for 2 pancake meals that didn't even get eaten. NEVER AGAIN! I suggest another location before you choose this one!",

We arrived at about 1pm and had to wait about 15 minutes until we sat down. That there was a good sign of good food. When people travel to Vegas all they think about is the chain restaurants and the buffets. Well since we stayed in Summerlin this was quite a treat. Unfortunately we sat at a section where the server was not attentive. She was quite slow and didn't check up on us. Hence the reason I gave 4 stars. I don't remember her name as I doubt she even gave us her name. She looked distraught as soon as she came to take our order. The greeter was nice enough to grab our drinks but then waited a good 25 minutes for the server to pop in and ask if we where ready. Aside from the minimal problems with the server. Food was exceptionally delicious. We all ordered an omelet as they make them fresh and use four large organic eggs. I had the Sundance special. It had spinach mushroom and artichokes. Plus lots of feta cheese. It was delicious. Their banana nut bread is to die for. Amazing. Anyways next time in town I'll definitely hit this place up for our breakfast needs.",

We ordered  the classic bacon and eggs, easy enough, but noooo.... my order was incorrect and had to be corrected. The food was luke warm and basically  boring. We finished and went pay our bill and there  was another line to pay, they only have one  cash register  but 2 people standing there. This place is off my list, i won't  be going back there.",

We choose to sit outside. The view of the mountains was nice.   After ordering eggs and turkey bacon, and a skillet, we got the banana nut muffin. It was warm and was a nice touch. The rest of the food was were it starts to get bad. The potatoes were heavily seasoned for a breakfast dish but that could just be a preference. The turkey sausage looked like flat lumps of mushed meat- tasted as described.   But here's were it gets the worst for me, the price was 25 dollars and some change. In my opinion, go down the street a ways to Tivoli Village, Leone Cafe and eat a beautiful meal, in a gorgeous atmosphere, for the same price. The quality of food at Egg Works was not worth it. Luckily we had a coupon. Still, would have chosen the other breakfast spot over Egg Works.   Hoped this place was going to become our new neighborhood breakfast spot but instead we were completely disappointed in everything about this establishment.",

Each time, the server was pleasant but the orders come out wrong. How do onions end up in a blueberry pancake? I ordered the chicken burrito and it was awful. The rice was so gross and tasteless. My husbands breakfast potatoes were so overly season salted they were inedible. The servers have been great each time but the food was gross. Also, most restaurants don't charge to have a child's milk refilled.",

So I asked my waitress if she ask for his paper work and she said \" I don't have to ask because his dog have a vest on and your don't\".

But after that roadblock the food was delicious and stuff my self with Grandpa's Biscuits and Gravy which I highly recommend to get.

This one place popped up, and caught my attention. As, I walked towards the restaurant, I noticed it was extremely busy and packed. Many people waiting. I decided to go sit by counter. Service was very good. Ethan, my waiter was patient and attentive. I was really hungry, I ordered their corn beef hash with tots and eggs  of course. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling the corn beef. I really wanted to like it. I just couldn't. It just a had a weird taste, at least for me. I may have just ordered the wrong item. But, I'd still come back, next visit.",

We came twice in two days, service was great, seating was fast on Friday and wait on Saturday morning was a quick 15 minutes.  Seating outside is also a dog patio.  Fruit side and main dish is awesome, my advice just order the fruit side as the entree includes coffee and toast for almost double the price.  Oatmeal was good.   Both times we were there the servers customized our selections of sides to creat a meal and saved us $.  Single disappointment was whether you wanted hash brown patties or country potatoes, they were frozen and processed.  Would have liked fresh but or grated but that's a personal preference.  We had one issue with a serving that was quickly addressed with many apologies from 2 different managers and staff.  Handled very well and we came back the next day with friends.",

With that said, I love coming to this location because of the Train they have running throughout the whole establishment up by the ceiling. My toddler loves it and keeps him entertained whenever it enters the room.  As far as food go, their Banana Muffin is amazing. Served Warm. And melts in your mouth. I typically order the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet- breakfast potatoes smothered in Country Gravy, with a large cut up portion of the streak (no need to use a knife as they cut it up for you!) And topped with your choice of egg (I only eat scramble). It's simple but so damn good!   The kids meals come with choice of potatoe or fresh fruit, which I love because potatoes are hit and miss with my toddler (and a side of fruit is $6!).   I don't come here as often as I would like due to distance and husband, but I do try to take the time to do mommy and son breakfast from time to time.",

Our server wasn't quick but the initial wait wasn't too bad. However, the server seemed a little abrupt. We decided to give her the benefit of the doubt as we were hungry so maybe it was OUR perception. haha  But no. Each time she was distracted and less than present. She wasn't mean or nasty, just not fully engaged. We often had to flag down another server for drink refills or other needs. By the end of our meal she hadn't been seen in twenty minutes and we had to hail yet another staff member for to go boxes. (Incidentally, we were not the only ones. We saw other tables going to the hostess stand for help.)  The food was fine. I didn't get to try the muffins as the server neglected to bring mine, but the omelets we ordered were not bad. The potatoes were over salted, but I don't like salt so that could have just been me. Coffee was good and strong.   Overall, the restaurant was loud and dirty, we heard drops and breaks multiple times. I'm ok cutting some slack for Sunday brunch being busy but for a breakfast restaurant, they were struggling. I was pretty disappointed and given the number of other options available, likely won't be back.",

It had avocado, tomato slices, and spinach, served on top of an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. It was good, but I would have rather had the spinach cooked, not raw. The potatoes served on the side could have been crispier.  It was a good breakfast. They have an extensive menu. I will be back to try more of their menu items.

The egg was cooked just right and the beef patty was good but the gravy was a disappointment.  If we come back we'll have to try a sandwich or something else. The restaurant is an open concept layout that makes it loud with customers with little volume control and they have a weird fenced off rock garden in the middle of the restaurant. The waitress Samantha was nice and did a good job. I would have to think hard about coming back to try something else.  On a funny note; when we got our check at the bottom it said to write a 4 or 5 star review on trip adviser so the waitress could win a trip to Disneyland.  I can't say I care for their tactics but I hope she wins.",

Amanda took our coffee and water order before we even sat down so we were very promptly served. We got a \"surprise\" for being first time customers, the food was good and portions were huge. But, this review is less for the restaurant, more to acknowledge that Amanda to Egg Works is what Flo is to Progressive car insurance commercials. AMANDA made the experience of just another Sunday breakfast so friendly and enjoyable I am actually writing a review about it on Yelp. Nicely done young lady! Do you want to come work for us?",

Amanda, our server, was AWESOME, positive and smiles+! She was such a super star! She gave us a free muffin because it was my first time. So sweet! She also had some House of Blues tickets for Wednesday night she gave us. Too cool!  These are my givens (remember in geometry, given and proof): I want my drink, or coffee carafe, refilled without my having to ask. I want the flavored creamers on the table so I don't have to ask. I want someone to keep checking to see which ones I've used when cleaning up the table, and please bring more. After my food is served, ask then, \"anything you need\", come back in a minute or so and ask \"everything cool?\" If my mouth is full, I won't be able to tell you what I need or may not want to interrupt the flow of what my colleague is saying...so please keep flying in for a look-see, check-in. Please leave more than one napkin for me. When my fork and knife are across the middle of my plate, I'm done. Please watch, clear the table of empty creamers, sugar packets and unnecessary side plates the muffins or toast came on. The tables aren't that big to hold it all once eaten. Thank you for gettin' it!  Felt such the love and care with Amanda. Her perkiness and willingness were FANTASTICALLY refreshing. My expectations for a positive business meeting are set by the tone of the environment. Where I choose says a great deal about who I am and creates the stage for our conversation and connect. This experience was exactly what I want to feel when I go out to spend money AND have a professional meeting. I have now found a new spot for my breakfast. Amanda nailed it! She made me look good. :)  I'm going to ask for her station every time. This review, amongst her others, better get her the Disneyland trip!! She deserves it! I'm expecting something Pooh to be coming back with her for me. ;)",

If it's made of cheap newspaper, you would think they would throw them away. Good for you for recylcing but its unsanitary to reuse that.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place since the nearby IHOP is terrible and I'm not a fan of the name changing, yet same menu at GriddleCakes (supposed to be ran together I didn't goof!). Too bad I wasn't so thrilled about this place either, but it for sure is better than the 2 breakfast spots I previously mentioned. I came in on a Sunday so naturally it was packed inside. I was with a yelper friend and we were still seated right away even though they were busy. There is a fair amount of tables and tables with half booths inside, but the table we were sat at shouldn't be there. I was practically sitting in the kitchen! Menus were brought to us right away and our server was nice. I just didn't like waiting f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get some cream for my coffee. I asked our server for it and she said she'd be right back. I watched her (since the machine they use to enter orders and the kitchen was right near me) enter in orders and tend other tables including the one customer crazy enough to eat out on the patio on such a hot day, but still I had no cream for my coffee. They have this thing on the table where if you are in need of something you can flip this \"egg\" to black when you are doing fine and flip it to yellow if you need something. The yelper I was with flipped the egg to yellow and someone quickly came over and got me some cream. I had already enjoyed 2 cups of coffee before I finally scored some. I thought the cup of coffee was steep being priced at $2.75, but damn that was good coffee! The coffee was the best thing I had during my meal. I like that they bring a carafe to your table so you can keep refilling your cup at your own leisure. Most of my rating goes to the coffee!   Priced at $10.75 I ordered a \"Bacon & Sliced Avocado Omelette\" that came with a side of \"Works Potatoes\" and a \"Banana Nut Muffin\" that I have heard many good things about. The muffin came out first and it was hot, fresh and moist, but where was the banana flavor? I tasted no banana. It just tasted like a warm muffin with a hint of sweetness. Nothing special. The works potatoes were good and seasoned nicely, but they tasted exactly like fries. I prefer more of a hash brown type of potato with my breakfast personally not fries. The omelette was just okay. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but there was actually too much bacon in it! Yes, I just said that! It was just too much bacon and not enough egg. The amount of cheese and avocado (it had huge chunks of ripe and delicious avocado!) was very fair. The omelette just wasn't fluffy enough though and when you have grown up eating them at the Omelette House on W Charleston like I have, you know what a perfect, good omelette is supposed to taste like and I just didn't find it here. The coffee being so good, I just might someday come back and give their french toast a try, but with my single breakfast totaling $13.50 before tax and tip and not being fully satisfied with it, I can't see coming back often or anytime soon.",

    "text": "Best breakfast place and conveniently located near home!  I love breakfast food, hate mornings, so I always end up enjoying it at night. Today was different since I actually woke up early enough on my day off to enjoy some eggs and coffee!!! My beau and I ordered:   - spinach Benny  - corned beef hash - coffee  - banana nut muffin  The spinach Benny is two poached eggs on top of Canadian bacon, spinach, and old English muffins covered in hollandaise sauce with a side of country potatoes. This was super tasty and the hollandaise was perfect and not too salty. The country potatoes were also deliciously golden crispy and perfectly seasoned. Mmm... Corned beef hash was served with a side of potatoes as well, but my beau ordered a side of rice to mix the hash with. It makes a great combo. The hash was good, I just wish there was more meat!!!  The banana nut muffins are always popular here, so it's no exception for me!! They're always nicely warm and sweet and perfect when you spread some butter on it. Gives it a nice balance of sweet and salty!! Pairs well with their coffee, and it's actually really good coffee.   This will always be my favorite breakfast spot and it's reasonably priced too. Portions are generous (although I always finish my plate) and the staff is always friendly and attentive! I'll definitely wake up early for this place...  Well, let's see how comfy my bed is that day... :)",

Where's the rest?  I'd go back for the service though. My server Amanda P rocked it! Attentive, but doesn't hover over like some buzzard.   Gonna give this place another shot.

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try Egg Works after some fasting blood work, and it was quite possibly one of the worst breakfasts we have ever had due to the poor food quality. I couldn't have been more hungry, but both of our meals were flavorless.  My omelet had a strange burnt oil flavor, though nothing seemed burned.  Apparently, the restaurant uses a liquid butter alternative (translation:  margarine and soybean oil mix) instead of real butter;  this is all I can imagine caused the strange chemical taste on an otherwise uneventful menu choice. There was no real cream for your coffee unless you asked for it (instead they serve a chemical non-dairy creamer), and we were told (when inquired about ingredients) that the potatoes \"come from a bag\" and the waitress couldn't really tell us what was in the seasoning.  I opted for a side of fruit instead.  The food tasted very processed, and gone seem to be the days when \"The Egg and I\" (1st restaurant) used to serve \"homemade\" breakfasts that you actually had to wait for--because they were cooking them--to be served. The speed with which the meals were served at Egg Works also indicated how truly processed these meals are. We ate little, and couldn't stomach taking the food home, though it was offered.  I noticed that tables on both sides of us were also leaving much of their meals.  When we left and saw the U.S. food delivery truck at the back of the restaurant, our suspicions on poor food quality were further confirmed.   Items ordered:  Coffee Hash and eggs Vegetable omelet w/fruit side  We cannot recommend Egg Works based on our experience.  At least consumers need to be aware that this is not \"homemade\" food, nor is it healthy.",

The only negative would be the seasoned potatoes they serve with all breakfast offerings, as they are just okay, and I would've much preferred hash brown potatoes (which don't even seem to be available as an option). Would recommend that management strongly consider offering hash browns.   Will definitely return as the menu has many appealing options.",

The food looked appetizing but unfortunately my entire meal was SO over SALTED, it was hardly edible. I didn't bother sending it back because I was with a group.   My spinach eggs Benedict was extremely salty and so were the side potatoes. Additionally the poached eggs were completely runny (not the gooey consistency). I guess I expected a little more based on the great reviews.  I do not recommend the Benedicts. Ask them to hold the salt.",

Our breakfast was amazing! I had the Blackened Prime-Rib Benny and it was all so perfect. All the flavors meshed well and you could tell they make sure they cook things right here. My friend had one of their burgers and he said it was cooked just perfectly. Overall we had a great time here. The atmosphere was homey, especially with the train passing over our heads.

Our waiter was so amazing, he told us about the half option as well as customize anything you want! I did half cheese on my scramble and it was just right for me.

Food usually comes out fairly quickly and checkout is quick since you take your bill to the front.

My friends had asked me to bring them take out banana nut muffins.   So I ordered a few of those to go.  I ordered the Three Little Pigs omelette to dine there with my muffin.    The omelette was tasty but nothing to equal the raves my friends gave me of the place.  The muffin was also tasty but nothing I had to get again or ask someone to bring me.

She took such great care of us, was super sweet and fun! Food could have been crap and still would give 5 stars cause I'm so all about that customer service, and Maryann has it! But, luckily the food wasn't crap! It was bomb! I'm not a meat eater but now and again I'll have tuna. Their tuna melt is the best!!!!! Real tuna, melted perfect cheese and the parmesan sour dough??? Lawdy!!! Perfect! Seasoned fries are great too!!! My mom had a Bloody Mary and said it was the real deal! We loved everything about our experience here!",

Based on my personal experiences here, it's average. Today though, with my meal it was just down right trash y'all, honestly truly. I had the Carlsbad sandwich on sourdough with a side of fries. The sandwich is essentially a club ok and I can't even make this up but 3/4 of this sandwich was sad iceberg lettuce. The turkey was barley there. Like there was maybe an ounce of shredded turkey breast on one half of the sandwich. Also the fries were so overly fried that they were nearly burnt through.  Personally I don't see myself or my family coming back. The food we've had is average and not worth the price. But as always make your own opinion, I hope it's better for you then it was for us!",

Saves me a lot of money which is why I don't mind spending on dishes I can technically cook myself.   Service is always A1, more than what I would expect from a crazy busy place. My usual order consists of a simple American breakfast (scrambled eggs, sausages, and their delicious seasoned potatoes). They also serve a juicy steak and eggs meal, good portion too!   When I feel like venturing out of my comfort zone I get the eggs Benedict with the Canadian ham and Portuguese sausages on the side. Hearty but beware of the hollandaise sauce of course. Shoots your cholesterol right up!",

Thanks to the Egg card, I never have to wave anyone down. Just flip it and someone will be along. When you order coffee, it's $2.75. I find this to be pretty expensive. However, they bring you a whole carafe. They don't do said cubed fruit if you want an alternative to potatoes. Just freshly sliced, tasty fruit.  Portions are huge, and the hot sauce is so good I  bought it. The omelettes are huge, and made from high quality ingredients. Waitresses  have NO problem customizing your order within an inch of it's life.  Unfortunately, the food is bland. I love the potatoes, and the fruit.. But biscuits and gravy are a little off, the biscuit being too airy, and the gravy just missing something. The omelettes, no matter which one I get, never seem to have any flavor. Good ingredients, but they don't season it. To be honest, Baby Stacks is far better. Also, I'm not too excited about the whole \"Send your server to disneyland with a high review\"  thing. I think that's leading to this place being way over hyped.",

What's also a cute idea is that they have a dog-friendly patio where your doggie can sit with you. We don't have a dog, but we love to see dog owners enjoy breakfast time with their cute pets.   Their bottomless, delicious hot coffee is also just perfect for me in the morning! My kids love to come here too. Their favorites are the French toast & the Mouse-shaped pancake. Service is courteous and quick, although today they did forget my banana nut muffin and one of our side toasts (it's okay these things happen sometimes )... but we didn't realize it until after we left... because truthfully our tummies were stuffed silly lol!  I can definitely recommend the charming Summerlin location. If you go early, there's no wait-time to get seated. They are open from 6am to 3pm.",

My family comes here often because it is in their neighborhood and from what they said no other restaurant has really lasted because it isn't high traffic outside work hours.  I got the greek scramble with no chicken; it was egg-cellent!! Good combination of artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach and feta.  The potatoes were okay, not a fan of the seasoning but still good.

For an American restaurant, I never expect flavorful salsa but this one hit the spot. They even sell it in bottles. After the savory dish,  my palate was happily dancing with bites of banana nut muffin. I would def. Return again.",

    "text": "I have two kinds of breakfasts I like when I eat out: the first is usually with visitors who want a unique experience and are usually still drunk when they wake up so we will hit one of the delicious options on The Strip. The other breakfast option is my more frequent trip down the street to a comfortable friendly place like Egg Works. I don't look for anything fancy and it is the ambience and service that brings me back regularly. This is most definitely the case with Egg Works. The greeting is always welcoming but the severs take everything to another level and make you feel more like you are visiting friends than dining out. I'm an early bird so I can usually anticipate a seat outside on the patio where I am often doted on by the friendliest staff you could hope for. I am not an adventurous breakfast eater and usually stick to the basics, which are consistently fresh and well prepared. If there is anything to truly rave about though it is the captivating personalities of the staff. Las Vegas is a town where you should expect good service and this vibe certainly infuses Egg Works. Not only is the wait staff friendly, efficient and hospitable, the extra bit of personality offered up just brings the whole experience to another level and starts my day off with a great positive vibe. If you ever want to practice overtipping, this is the place to do it since the servers make you feel so welcome and appreciated.I have even developed my own \"server crush\" and always ask if the lovely Nicole can, you know, \"butter my bread.\"",

It came with a choice of sides,  I selected the fries. While a little pricey for lunch, well worth it. The chicken salad was delicious. I liked the apples and walnuts added into it. The French fries were crisp and seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper. Had a little kick to them. Aside from Nathan's fries this would be my second best. It also came with a pickle spear.  Went the other day for lunch to dine in with a coworker. We were seated right away. Our server Rosemary was right there, which was great as we only had an hour. She had our order out in minutes, and gave me extra pickle spears with my chicken salad sandwich this time, as I have to watch the carbs I eat. My friend had the  same sandwich and loved it. We were in and out in forty minutes. Can't beat that kind of service.  We will be back to enjoy the food and the service.",

Our waitress was Maryanne and she was so nice and helpful. We each got a free banana muffin since it was our first time! So delish. I ordered the maple bacon French toast but when it came the stuffed part tasted like blue cheese for some weird reason. They were immediately happy to take it back and offer me a new dish which was awesome. I tried my moms corned beef hash-so good and very flavorful. My husband got the Ensenada burrito and that was smothered in a verde sauce that was great too! My second entree came out and it was the strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast. It was smothered in a strawberry jam sauce and very filling -sugar high! The only thing I wish they would do is rename the fence toast since the \"stuffing\" wasn't actually stuffed in the bread, just sat on top like butter or a sauce. So that was a little deceiving but it still tasted amazing. Our waitress was the best-very friendly and an amazing host for our first time at this place!",

It was eggcellent!! AMANDA WAS AMAZING (ask for her, she is the only Amanda there.)   I had the Huevos Rancheros with a side of avocado.  It was perfectly cooked and the tomatillo salsa mixed with the house salsa is incredible.  Neither are overly hot, yet have a great flavor.  My girlfriend had the Key Largo crepe.  Besides being massive it was tasty. I had a bite and couldn't agree more.  Finally, my father is a very particular orderer. They executed the order perfectly, he was very happy with his meal.  We all tried the banana nut muffins and they are the epitome if happiness.  Everyone should have them at least once.    Finally, the service is really out of this world. Amanda joked around with us and made the eating experience a real treat.  All food was brought out promptly and hot.  I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone in the area.",

    "text": "If I could give this place a 0 star I would. The cashier Linda is a racist older lady. At the register it's says have ID ready for credit cards & debit. Well my African American husband was asked for his ID. Although we watched her not ask the 5 white customers in front of her for their IDs or the white customer behind us. When I questioned her she was mumbling & fumbling her words saying because she knows them they come everyday & proceeded to point to a white man standing next to us & said see like him. WTF does that have to do with anything! I should have asked her the Guys name. I was so steamed at her lying ass. All customers should be treated equal. You might as well have a sign posted white customers don't need to show your ids black customers have your Id ready. I'm reporting this restaurant the BBB & every organization I can think of regarding racist business practices! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS!!  Since my 1st review I received racist emails as well as kind emails applauding me for standing up bc they too had experienced the same behavior from this business. Please see photos. One was from someone with the initial L & had the restaurant's notice as a profile picture. The cashier's name was Linda how ironic. (To that person who I am sure is reading this; I'm Asian get your facts straight buddy.) He she is hiding behind a fake profile using the same initial as the employees. I'm standing up to what I see is as an injustice. It goes back to when restaurants had signs saying \"whites\" & \"blacks\" to determine where you sat by the color of your skin. I hope this establishment stops hiding behind emails & publicly puts an end to this racial profiling.",

So we figured we'll try this Egg Works (we've now been to 3 Egg Works/Egg & I locations) as it's really close to our new house we bought in Summerlin.  The service, like the other 2 locations, is great. So nice to see people who actually like their jobs (or at least very good at faking it if they're not), from the hostess, to the waitress and the cashier (she was a hoot).  I tried the chicken fried steak skillet and holy poop, it was AWESOME!!!  My husband ordered eggs & bacon and after tasting mine, said \"I should have ordered that.\"  We look forward to becoming regulars here soon, based on the wonderful service and the really really good and very reasonably priced food.",

Yesterday I got the huevos rancheros - delicious but not healthy by any stretch. Today I got the classic breakfast- two eggs, a side of fresh cut generous portion of fruit instead of breakfast potatoes and an English muffin. Delish!

I like counter seating for breakfast because you have the chance to watch the staff do their things and you have a glimpse into the kitchen.  After looking over the extensive menu, I opted for the Sundance Special, a vegetarian omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, artichoke, with Swiss cheese folded in all in a 4 egg omelette.  It was topped by diced fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.  I had my choice of potato but I opted for some sliced tomatoes instead.  Instead of toast, I got the banana nut muffin.  Breakfast was very good and it was also a lot to eat.  Service was outstanding.  There was only one other person at the counter.  Your coffee is poured for you the first time and they leave a thermos of coffee for you.  It was great because I could drink as quickly as I wanted and refill without waiting.  The staff was very pleasant and I left with a good impression of this new place.",

I had the cheese steak which was dry for my taste. I will probably order something else next time. The train going around the ceiling was a great distraction for my kid. The patio has a mist system so even on a hot day, I imagine it would be okay to sit out there. Having to pay at the front register meant there was a bit of a wait to get going.",

    "text": "Great food! We come to this place a lot and sit in the dining area. However, we sat in the bar area today because it was packed and we witnessed a very gross thing that everyone did in this place. The bar area lets you see part of the kitchen and the preparation area. So ALL servers who passed by the toaster machine placed all of the customers' toast in the toaster with their bare dirty hands. No hand washing or wearing gloves! And this is EVERY SERVER, it wasn't like one or two people, it was ALL servers (except the one lady that was there in the preparation area). We probably witnessed more than 10 occassions of 8 different servers doing this. With one lady, she placed the toast in the toaster, took out her dirty black check holder (which probably has money germs) while waiting for the toast to get done and then touched the toast. The other lady handled dirty dishes to bring to the dirty dishes plastic container and then went to touch the toast to place in the toaster. So that just tells you how things are here with food handling, what more can they do when eyes are not on them. My husband spoke to the manager, hoping that she will do something about it to improve. For now, don't think we will be going back because that's what I'll think about when eating here.",

We always sat in the same spot and typically had the same servers. They always remembered what we wanted to drink when we sat down. Breakfast was always delicious, I usually tried to eat something different everytime since we came so often. I was never let down. Nothing was ever bad.   This place has always had great customer service. They are attentive and helpful.   The restaurant is clean. They have a train that travels around on tracks close to the ceiling.  Today I came with friends for lunch. The customer service was great as always. The food again was delicious and I had nothing bad to say about it. I had the Reuben with french fries. My friends has the French toast, the turkey sandwich and fries and the BBQ burger. No one had anything bad to say.   I highly recommend this place, they have never let me down.",

The pork chops are always cooked just right and so are my eggs. I'm super particular about my eggs and the cook them right to my specifications. I usually get fruit instead of their potatoes because their potatoes are often a bit salty to me, but their fruit to replace them is always fresh-so I'm delighted. You HAVE To try their bloody Mary's! Their diablo spice is delicious!!!",

We usually see our waitress Lisa, who is just amazing, she always smiles and it always happy about when you see her. There are several other waitresses that are also very nice and friendly and always say hello when I am there, usually Sundays. Lexie, Jayna, Nicole, Jess, Linda, Megan, Sophie, the new manger there (can not remember her name....sorry) these ladies (sorry if I miss anyone) are always going above to make the customers happy, I am sure they have some customers who aren't happy with them, but this place has become a favorite to visit and favorite to go to. I look forward every week when I see them all smiling and saying \"Good Morning Travis...\" most of them know my name. I always and will continue to recommend this place to everyone who comes into town I talk about it enough most want to see what its about. Now I am sure there are customers who did not have good experience, but I like to share mine, I am a mynute the whole Egg Works and Egg and I resturants but I have no had any bad experiences here. Keep up the Good work Ladies and Gents! See you soon!",

I have to say each location the food does have a little different taste, same menu but I order almost the same thing here and it is better on one location then another I love brunch so unless I am going to go to LA or the strip and want a nice variety, we have 4 spots and this one tends to get us fed at least once a month, however it seems the larger they get the quality drops...  as well as the service has seemed to suffer since their boom..  I always get a skillet and friends get egg white omlets, pancakes etc. We always leave full and it is a good spot to have a good brunch, just a pain during 11-2 but that's a good thing since they are busy.  Their orange juice is always freshly squeezed, coffee is always a bit burnt so expect to add extra sugar.  Yummy banana muffins (they do have nuts so warning if you are allergic)   Portions are great and you can get half sizes which is nice compared to other places.  They Rarely get the bacon or meat products cooked to order but the eggs are usually spot on (perhaps that's why it's called egg works ha ha) They used to have fresh fruit on every plate but for some reason discontinued that practice.  Pancakes are always huge and kid portions are enough to feed a teen so no skimping there...  Good comfort breakfast foods...",

I was trying to find a place to eat when my bf suggested Egg Works. I brushed him off and agreed to it because I was tired, hungry and wanted to get it over with.  My first impression of the place was wonderment. The outside patio is misted so that the people enjoying their meals are kept relatively cool, since, you know... it's kinda hot out here. But just a little.  When we came in we were greeted and checked in for a table. In the lobby/waiting area there is a tiny cute train near the ceiling that goes through some of the restaurant and the front. HOW CUTE!! Anyway, the prices were a little high, but we were hungry and the place is really nice so why not.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and my bf ordered the country fried steak. Never would I have imagined that they would produce some delicious food! YUM! Also what an extensive menu!   We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and will gladly come back another time! :)   Great start to my move :)",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by Egg Works. My partner and I didn't know what to eat when we woke up. I did a quick search of breakfast places nearby and egg works popped up...as well as IHOP. I honestly kind of enjoy IHOP a little, but we decided to do something different. I expected Egg Works to be a very generic breakfast place, but man was I wrong.  Walking in it looks typical. Until you see the little toy train racing long a track that's suspended near the ceiling of the restaurant. The train and little Egg people riding on it. Adorable. The place had a wait, but it was only 10minutes even though there was a good 8 people ahead of us. I thought that was pretty awesome and the reason why it was so quick a wait I'll explain shortly.  After we were seated we were greeted by a very kind woman who had a southern twang in her voice and was rocking a full set of braces. I noticed because she was all smiles all the time. The best way I can describe her personality is what you'd expect from someone touting that \"southern hospitality\" everyone speaks of.  The menu was super unique. It was in the style of a newspaper. Like seriously you just read the menu like a newspaper! I know, I'm amazed by simple things. They had a pretty extensive menu. From country fried steak to breakfast burritos to 5-6 different types of french toast. For real, if you like french toast, then go here. I may not have tried it, but any place that cooks up carrot cake french toast deserves a must a try stamp.  I went with the country fried steak and my partner got the breakfast burrito. Now here's where the explanation for the wait time is. Two minutes after we ordered I was server by banana bread muffin (delicious) and 7 minutes after the muffin we got out food. Wooow was it fast. It's something I'm not used to coming from Chicago.  The portion sizes were great. They gave you a heaping pile of their signature Diablo potatoes, which are just seasoned home fries. They were amaaazing. Loads of flavor and cooked well so they weren't hard. The country fried steak was delicious. Very tender, no tough parts at all, and the gravy was extra creamy tasting. I think it had bits of ham in it if I'm not mistaken.   My partner's breakfast burrito was very good as well. They basically took a breakfast skillet and dumped it on a tortilla and rolled it into a burrito. It was packed with ingredients. There was a whole lot of flavor in each bite. They also give you a hot sauce/salsa that reminds me of Taco Bell fire sauce but in a good way. It adds a nice smoky flavor if you like that.  When the bill came, I wasn't taken aback by the price or anything. It was very agreeable with the service and quality of food I received. Overall this place was great and I advise anyone in the area to try it out if you love a good breakfast. If I lived in Vegas I'd be eating there a lot.",

I walked in and went straight to the back because i call in pick up orders often as i work in the same area so I'm familiar with the pick up order process and I'm usually greeted with a big smile when i get to the back counter but instead this morning (and the last time was the similar problem) i was standing there for about 3 minutes while the girls are having casual conversation with the one gentleman sitting at the counter. After a minute or so, the gentleman looks at me because he notices that I'm still standing there and the girls even look at me and still don't acknowledge and think \"hey maybe this person in scrubs ordered some food like the rest of the customers here, considering we work at a restaurant.\" Nope, not one hello or we'll be with you shortly. The restaurant wasn't even 40% full and yet they couldn't find the time to ask if i needed help or anything. ELMER then passes as he is bussing a seat by me and asks if I've been helped yet and was very kind when i said no. He dropped what he was doing and asks my name to see if the one to go bag had my name on it and it did so he makes sure with the blonde girl back there that everything is in the bag and she looks back and says \"oh yeah everything is there!\" She even makes eye contact with me and isn't taken back by the fact that a customer was even there and she didn't approach them so she clearly knew i was there but refused to help me because whatever she was doing was more important than a customer who was ready to pay for their food and whose office is constantly ordering food from here. Great food just expecting better service even if I'm not sitting down ordering, but thank you Elmer for taking time to take care of the customer(s).",

We were staying at the Red Rock Inn and wanted to venture out from the basic restaurants at the hotel & ended up here.   I am on a healthy eating kick but since it was vacation I wasn't too picky but I ordered the veggie something or other (where the eggs Benedicts are).   It consisted of hollandaise sauce, poached eggs, A LOT (!!!) of avocado, spinach, & tomatoes.   It was seriously one of the top 5 best breakfasts I've ever had. So delicious. Idk if it was the hollandaise sauce, or they just cooked it with a lot of love- it was good.   The rest of the fam ordered loco moco (hamburger patty, rice and gravy) and two kids meals: one with eggs and bacon and the other French toast. The loco moco and the eggs and bacon kids meal each came with a banana bread muffin thing. If you check in, you can also get one for free. It was a tad sweeter & stickier than I liked, but still good.  Our waiter was always prompt and polite. Good customer service.   You pay up front for the record.",

My wife got the half and couldn't finish, I was a bit more hungry and got the full and almost finished. They have plenty of gluten free options which is nice since so many places don't.   Our server was one of the best I have ever had anywhere. So knowledgeable and attentive. I wish I had remembered his name. But they all seemed very good and always visiting tables. If you love breakfast food try this place!",

We came here twice so far, best to come later around 11-12 otherwise the wait is a doozy!   Today we ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger with onion rings, grandmas biscuits and gravy, the works waffles, a kids scramble, and a cheesesteak.   In the past we have gotten the strawberry and creme french toast, and chicken fried steak.   The breakfast food is all superb! The CFS is definitely delicious, not THE best, but delicious. They use a pork country gravy here. The eggs are cooked to your liking, and are served with potatoes. I got the fries, and they are super tasty!   Today and waffles was delicious and fluffy, he opted for the works with strawberries and whipped cream. Absolutely scrumptious! My son had the bbq bacon burger and it was perfect! The onion rings were also tasty and that buttered brioche bun was perfect!  Biscuits and gravy were just ok, the biscuits seemed a little underdone, but a big serving for 8.75 was a good price point.   The only item I wasn't pleased with was the cheesesteak, it definitely isn't your typical philly. It was flavorless and smothered with cheese, so it was very greasy. The peppers also weren't your normal peppers, they were finally diced. It just wasn't good at all. Stay away from that item.   Overall, most everything was perfect, especially our server Felicia! Even with the nasty philly, just because of her service, it's 5 stars!  Yay!  Download the 2for1 app for their daily 2for1 specials.",

Been here many times but decided to write a review because our server was truly outstanding with his service. Oscar, I believe his name was. Oscar was attentive, had a genuinely great attitude and was courteous in making sure everything was to our liking. He truly went out his way by suggesting stuff I didn't even know I could order or do, and even gave us a water to go in this heat.  I don't know if it's sad or just so common to not have a high expectations for good service. I mean I get it, working in customer service is not an easy field and sometimes sucks the life out of you.  Point is, was totally caught off guard today and am grateful we got Oscar!

It's located right off of town center in the hills, summerlin. The parking is plentiful and easy.     I'm always greeted with a smile when we come in which is great, because I'm usually tired and hungry. The service is always super friendly, accommodating, and efficient.   I always order the vegan version of the veggie skillet (I add jalapenos, broccoli, and extra spinach). It comes out perfect every time. They offer mimosas, bloody Mary's, vodka ojs, and vodka red bulls. I like the mimosas... always a great Sunday morning treat for me.   This is a great place to go with your friends, family, and even by yourself. They have a dog friendly patio, so it's always awesome to sit outside and be around all the pups! They have misters for the hot summer months ahead (don't worry)! If you're looking for a good breakfast/brunch place in the area, check it out!",

Our waitress quickly realized I was a handsome beautiful soul and gave our table a round of muffins.  Let me tell you, it was delicious! It tastes like the muffin man was a chef in their kitchen, baking up their soft bread. It was so fucking soft it stuck to my hands, and that shit is lit    Their food was on point, pancakes were tasty, and I got no complaints.

Even though the place was packed, our server was so friendly and even helped us pick out our dishes by making recommendations to us.   I ordered the loco moco, which is sooooooo good. The rice was perfect and a little sticky, which I like. The patties were juicy and the gravy was the perfect compliment to the meat, eggs and rice. My friend got an omelet (can't remember which one) but he enjoyed it. My husband ordered blueberry pancakes and those were so good. We finished every bite, despite the large portion sizes.

The 2 good things I can say about EW is that the service was good, and the menu was vast. Our waitress (Sadly, I can't remember her name) was very attentive, and there were so many items on the menu that it was difficult to choose.  I finally decided on the traditional Eggs Benedict. The sauce was greasy and it was unflavorful, the Canadian bacon too thick and fatty, and it arrived lukewarm. My kids all ordered Bloody  Mary's. They complained that it was mostly ice, and maybe 1/2 cup of actual drink.   My final complaint is that it was freaking freezing in the restaurant. Now, I get that we live in LV and people must have the AC cranked up in places of business. However there is a fine line between comfortably cool and being so arctic that you are shivering and can't enjoy your meal.  The 2 stars are for the attentive service that our nice waitress gave us. I wish I could remember her name.",

We are able to bring our dog and enjoy the food and service.  This is a place where they  know your name and you are not just another \"customer\". For example, I had lost my keys and the manager Danielle, helped me look for them outside and inside. She acted like they were her keys and she would not stop until she found them...talk about amazing customer service and  genuineness! Tess is another manager that got involved in the searching and they both found my key which was stuck in a booth.  They had to take the booth apart to get to it...I am sure they had more important things to do but they ended up finding my key and saving the day!  This is a yummy place to eat whether you are in the mood for some breakfast or lunch...they got it all!!",

    "text": "FYI, my husband and I had breakfast there this morning.  In case you're interested, we want you to know why we will NOT be returning.  We found the tables & chairs very uncomfortable.  The tables are so small that when the meal comes, you have to do a lot of juggling around to make room for the rest of the stuff that you already have on the tables.  A few more inches would have been a much better design plus the chairs are very uncomfortable.  The place has no soundproofing and is very, very loud.  It reminded us of a cafeteria much like a school.  We kept thinking we were in a factory--not a pleasant atmosphere at all.  We feel it is disgusting that whoever designed this place all they had in mind was how many people we can fit no matter how uncomfortable they may be.    Atmosphere and surroundings are just as important to us as the food when we dine at a restaurant.  Even though the food was good and the staff was very attentive, which did please us, I noticed on our receipt, it did not have a website to let you know where you could comment on your visit.",

I am disabled and needed a little assistance in transferring from scooter to chair. I ordered coffee, veggie omelette with a side bacon. Coffee was served hot and fresh with a pot of coffee left at the table. The omelette was just okay but the bacon was tasteless and had a stiff, rubbery texture. Oh well. I'm sure it's just one of those things that doesn't happen often. I will come again just to see if the breakfast served me next time is any better. My bill came to $15.00. My waitress' name was Lisa, if memory serves me. Very likable, courteous and competent.",

The near loss of a star was mostly due to the unimaginative potatoes.  It seems all they do is overcook them a little then throw a little too much salt on them.  Onions?  Peppers?  Spices?  Give me SOMETHING to work with here chef.  The corned beef hash, however, was the bomb!  Toast or banana nut muffin?  Really?  You have to ask?  BANANA NUT MUFFIN, of course!   Yum!",

I glanced at the tables next to me and plates piled high were being served. No wonder Americans are overweight. Whatever happened to petite meals of good quality and that taste good?  First to arrive was a chocolate-colored muffin, I said 'I ordered banana nut', waitress said 'it is'. Sure enough it was and it was the best banana-nut muffin I've ever had.  Shortly the omelet arrived with a large, 1-cup serving of cottage cheese (and a soup spoon to eat it). The veggie omelet was covered with two types of cheese which didn't add to the taste so I scraped it off. The omelet was excessively oily; too oily for my taste. That's why I have given it two stars.  Final bill was $14 which I consider overpriced for the quality of the food I was served.",

This was my first time to this location in Summerlin.  I think I prefer this location to the others simply because it was quiet an calm.   Our server was very sweet and efficient.  Our food was delivered to our 6 top very quickly.  One of my absolute favorite items on the menu is the habla Diabla potatoes. I can never make a visit without munching on an order.   Another great feature about this location is the pet friendly patio with a great view of Town Center drive. How exciting it is watching people navigate through the traffic circle.  Not as thrilling as watching a Russian dash cam video clip but close enough.",

They can't seem to cook an egg over medium with the whites cooked. It either comes out hard or with running white . Coffee is VERY GOOD. And the ambience is also very nice.   It is very pricey:  Pancakes one egg and coffee, if you include a 20% tip is almost $15. This is absurd when you can go to other restaurants and get the same thing for approximately half the price.   On a good note:  Kudos to the manager Amy, she is very nice and is a credit to this business so I gave them the one star.",

I understand when it's busy that happens but she was busy gossiping not doing her job. Every time I turned my egg over for help; the young gentleman who sat us got us whatever we needed. He had blonde hair and was tall. He didn't seem to mind helping; we were just irritated because he's not our server! When we left to pay he checked us out and smiled and said to have an \"eggcellent\" day. He never was aware we were upset; we never led on. We wanted to tip him and asked him if we could. He smiled and politely refused. My husband tried to pass him money anyway but the host wouldn't accept it. That made a big impression on us. Because of that young man, we will be back. Just didn't realize youngsters existed like him anymore. Quite refreshing! It was on a Sunday this happened. Food was amazing as always just a little disappointed in the server but everyone has an off day.",

We aren't dog owners, but LOVE that their patio is dog friendly. We were seated as soon as we walked in the door, so no wait.   Our server Kelli was awesome. Such a sweet girl, checked on us often and made sure that we were satisfied. So super nice, you definitely have a wonderful employee in her.   The food was good, not out of this world amazing, but we enjoyed it. Daughter has the mouse pancake, which they made into a Minnie Mouse, complete with a bacon \"smile\", blueberry \"eyes and nose\" and orange slice \"eye lashes\". She loves pancakes and Minnie Mouse, so she definitely loved it.   Husband had the biscuits and gravy meal. He said the biscuits could have used a little more gravy, and the gravy needed a little more sausage, but otherwise really great meal. The potatoes are amazing, and don't have all that \"crap\" other places put in them (onions, peppers, etc).   I ordered the mushroom omelet, and a side of biscuits and gravy. The mushroom omelet was too much for me, so my husband ate that too. He said it was \"ok\", had to add hot sauce to it, but he ate the whole thing. I filled up totally on the small side of biscuits and gravy, and I thought it was delicious! I do agree that they could have had a little more gravy.   Overall we really love this little place and will definitely come back.   Tldr: the food was good, atmosphere pleasant, server Kelli amazing",

    "text": "Items Selected: 2 Buttermilk Biscuits Ham, Egg, and Cheese Stuffed French Toast with Strawberry Jam and hash browns Candied Walnut Buttermilk Pancakes (seasonal special)  With household chores needing attention it was largely a matter of location combined with a buy-one-get-one coupon that led me to Summerlin's relatively new Eggworks on Saturday, and having visited sister restaurant \"Egg & I\" nearly a year ago I'm happy to say that its fifth spin-off replicates the formula well, a very competent breakfast served amidst friendly confines fit for any age.  Obviously not the sort of place looking to reinvent the wheel, but rather a locals-only kind of spot where nearly all the patrons present during my early morning meal were 'regulars,' it was with nothing but smiles that I was greeted at the hostess podium at 6:45 and offered a seat at the kitchen-side bar or a table I opted for the later, a small two-top amidst spacious confines already loaded with condiments, menus, and utensils as College Gameday played on televisions all around.  Never shy to over-order, even as my waitress informed me that two entrees was \"a lot,\" it was mere moments after seating that I made my selections and starting with two doughy, $3.49 biscuits finding slight salvation in butter plus honey I quickly realized I should have again ordered the signature banana bread, though things would soon improve, my BOGO coupon yielding a duo of plates nearly overwhelming my small table.  Beginning first with another item dubbed 'signature,' the stuffed French Toast is offered with an option for bacon, sausage, or ham and doing my best to recreate the Monte Cristo the results were admirable - the fluffy eggs loaded with cheddar and chopped pork beneath slices of vanilla scented, golden bread ready to be gilded with syrup or jam.  Moving next to an item from the seasonal menu, a $9.75 three-stack of pancakes was next in line and topping the fluffy discs with pure-maple syrup brought from home plus a few pats of butter I'll be honest when I say these could just be the best buttermilk flapjacks in town, each bite surprisingly light with ample buttermilk tones punctuated by pockets of melting brown sugar and rich caramel with toasty walnuts through and through.  Far larger and brighter than the original Egg & I location with similar smiling service and a 6am opening every day of the week Egg Works Summerlin is a great addition to the neighborhood and with coupons frequently offered in the local mailers serves as a great place for families to enjoy a good breakfast without breaking the bank or succumbing to big chains like Denny's or IHOP.  Certainly not a 'destination,' but a great spot for a leisurely morning while reading the paper, watching gameday, or just sitting on the dog-friendly patio I only wish they advertised specials more prominently, the only indication of those lovely pancakes found on a laminated menu left at the table.",

I was greeted by the manager who went out of her way to make sure our seating was comfortable and near. Our waitress Hannah stopped by our table about ten times, so did the manager, making sure we had plenty of time to order and then making sure we were happy with our selections. The veggie omelette, which contained spinach, artichokes and mushrooms and topped with Feta Cheese and tomatoes, was really flavorful. I'm dieting, but it didn't taste like it. My mom ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. The gravy was from scratch or so it seemed. When you ask for a fruit substitution you get a great variety of sliced fruit. The presentation was lovely. I'll be back soon and will recommend this place to friends. Thank you for a great dining experience.",

Cool menu lots of choices we tried Chili Omelette I'll rate it as a 2/5 the seasoned potatoes overly spiced too salty for us didn't eat it next time will do fruits instead and try something different .i like it when they give you the coffee pot you don't need to wait for them to pour you the next one . I don't think I'll be back here soon lots of other places to try.",

After developing an appetite after driving in circles, we finally found the place.  Arrived in the later part of the day.  So we were lucky to be seated right away and were the last to leave.

We both ordered out breakfast and each ordered the typical Bloody Mary that we usually order. We received the Bloody Mary and it tasted like water and  bland tomato juice mixed together....  Awful. I know what the Bloody Mary's usually tastes like....  I've been ordering those for at least 4 years.....    We went up front to pay for the ticket, I asked to buy their bottles of Bloody Mary mix....  The cashier said that they're out and won't have them for one more week....  I told the young lady at the Register, that the Bloody Mary mix taste like water down tomato juice....  She said sorry....  Driving back home I called the egg works and asked for the manager...  I received a lady named Penny that claimed to be the manager.  I asked Penny if she was the manager, assistant manager, or a supervisor....  She refused to tell me, she talked over me and said I'm one of the managers....   She said this numerous times.  Penny then proceeded to tell me I should have gone to a manger before I left to tell them that them bloody Mary's tasted awful and not made from the proper mix.....  Mind you, I already said this to the cashier...  5 years of loyalty I've given to this place......  Only to be schooled by Penny, who talked to me rudely....  I will never come back....

They allow pets on the patio so we utilized it. How sweet of them to provide a water dish and a treat! We are from out of state and on rare occasion have the fortune of meeting such awesome people. The food was amazing too ass you can see we ate it all before I was able to take pictures of it lol. I would highly recommend this place!!! Thanks Angel, Amy and Matt",

    "text": "I'm happy to report that Egg Works does seem to care to make sure that your Eggs (and more) really Works. Hey, ya gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelette, right?   Service, per usual, is great. Typically, the biggest challenge at EW, in my opinion, is deciding what to order. With so much to choose from, I felt compelled to try something 'new' to me.   I don't think I'd ever had a skillet of any kind here, so I tried and enjoyed the Fresh Veggie Skillet. Atop a layer of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, is onion, tomato, bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, and fresh spinach, two over-easy eggs and finished with melted cheese. It's a good, hearty yet still relatively lighter option. And having been making the rounds at some steakhouses the previous few nights, a tasty oasis for me.   Choose between the fabulous banana nut muffin or toast, I went with my usual, the swirly rye. I don't always remember that butter is standard, so ask for dry if that's your mood. And on the health note: one of my dining companions ordered tomatoes (instead of potatoes). I got to try some too. Fresh and good. I am very pleased that when someone orders tomatoes as their side, that at EW, you actually get a full portion of tomatoes. That's not always been my experience (at Cracked Egg, for instance).   OK, so, nobody's perfect. And to that, there was one little hiccup this time - lipstick on my coffee cup. Yikes! Just wished I'd noticed that BEFORE I start drinking from it. Not enough to knock off a star, but maybe a reminder that things do get busy at EW, and it's a team effort to keep things running smooth. OK, next time, I'll try the pancakes, unless I have a hankering for an omelette..",

    "text": "TL;DR: I like this place and they have top notch customer service. I would recommend the french toast and any benedicts, but I would not recommend the omelette.  This place is pretty good. What we ordered: The Works Omelette, Spinach Benny, Bacon Maple Cream Stuffed French Toast, and 2 Coffees.  Cons: This place is called Egg Works so I thought a safe choice would be an omelette, but the omelette was not that good at all. It was actually very bland and was layered too thick. It was overcooked on the bottom and was sweating oil on the side of the plate. I would have given it 5 stars, but the omelette was sadly disappointed.  Pros: The best part of the meal I believe is the seasoned potatoes. They were well seasoned, crispy but not too crispy. With a little dab of ketchup, they filled me up and made me happy. When I go back, I will always order the potatoes. The salsa verde was amazing! It saved the omelette. I was ready to not eat the omelette after the first bite, but the green salsa verde has a very rich flavor and make the omelette edible.  The french toast by itself was ok at best, but the cream cheese was the staple element of the french toast. The candied walnuts added a very nice touch to the french toast. It was good, but I don't think it was worth the $10.50. Eggs Benedict was good as well. We asked for a side of the chipotle hollandaise sauce and damn it was good. The eggs benedict was already good by itself but the special sauce they have makes it even better.  **Recommendation for management: Reduce the menu. The menu is extremely extensive. Long menus are proven not to be good. It may give customers a larger selection, but creates a lot more work and tends to end in lower quality food for consumers. Keep up the good work with the great customer service.",

    "text": "I've come to the conclusion that there are two types of ratings here on Yelp...the Standard star rating, and the Suburban star rating.  The average Suburban star rating appears to generally be a star higher than it would be with the Standard star rating because the restaurant is in a suburban setting amongst all the other ho-hum chain restaurants.  I think that's the case for this place, the food was OK but not 4 1/2 stars worth.  I had the pork chop breakfast and Mark H had the New York strip breakfast.  Both were ok with the steak being the better of the two...seasoned nicely and was cooked to mid-rare as ordered.  My pork chops on the other hand were cut so thin (about 1/4\") that there was no way that they'd be anything but dry.  They were seasoned OK, but just so darn dry.  The other disappointment were the potatoes that came with Mark H's steak and eggs.  They were also quite dry like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time.  The best part of the breakfast was that you could get a house-made banana nut muffin instead of toast.  The muffin was tasty and really moist.  If you check in on Yelp, you also get a free banana nut muffin so we got the free one to go.  The service was friendly and attentive so that's also another thing Egg Works has going for it.  Don't get me wrong, this place is OK and compared to the numerous chain places in Summerlin it's better but I'm just not sure it's worth 4 1/2 stars.",

This was very average but for my first visit the price was great because we had a \"buy one entree get the second free (up to $8.00)\" coupon. Which was great, but for a buy one get one for only up to $8.00 it seemed silly because essentially all their meals are in the price range of $10-$12.  The place itself is huge and they have a cute country like theme with a train running on tracks above your head throughout the whole restaurant. Although right where we were seated, as we looked up to see the train pass by, you couldn't help but notice some cobweb on the ceiling.  On yelp they have the special to where you check in you get a free banana nut muffin, so we were excited to get that. It was a SUPER moist muffin, really tasty with some butter! For brunch I ordered the Santa Cruz burrito (chorizo sounded AMAZING for today). It was a mix of onions, peppers, eggs, chicken and chorizo covered in sauce, then served with a side of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were really tasty and crispy. The burrito itself was just so-so. I was REALLY looking forward for some chorizo but I couldn't taste any! And upon further inspection you could BARELY see ANY inside, it was all chicken and egg. Big let down.  My friend ordered their Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy, and although I didn't get to try it, I heard no complaints. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating, if I go back I think i'll try one of their sandwiches or pancakes, no more burritos from here for me.",

The banana muffin was yummy, moist w/a lot of flavor. This is my second time here, it's a darling place w/outdoor sitting and a Cho Cho train that goes around n around above r heads. The food overall is ok, next time I'll try the sandwiches.  The sandwiches look great, they're packed w/a lot of meat n cheese n tomatoes, etc. Samantha was sweet, got r food out as promptly as she could, kept checking back on us... Overall, it's ok but, will be back to try the sandwiches.",

They have a decent sized menu, and seem to do all of the favorites and standards.  Coffee was good and robust--a must for a business meeting.  Prices were fairly decent, too, especially for Summerlin.  The restaurant itself is a bit cavernous and not cozy, so more for a big group of your friends and family than an intimate dining experience with your better half.",

Our waitress Sophie, always makes sure everyone at the table is completely satisfied with their order and is always prompt to take care of our requests.    At times, we do have to wait a few minutes for a table, but it is always worth it.  When there is a wait time, rather than standing around in the the lobby or right outside the door waiting for your name to be called, they will notify you when a table is ready by sending you a text message.  This allows us to walk around and enjoy the area without a crowd around you.    Today I ordered the Works Omelette with the Diablo Breakfast Potatoes, the portions will never leave you feeling hungry and the delicious food and great service will want you to come back often.    Check in on yelp, you'll be treated to a complimentary fresh hot muffin that is just fantastic!  If you are looking for a great neighborhood breakfast restaurant, I highly recommend this Egg Works!",

I have never once been dissatisfied with any meal I've had at any location. It's always good! The banana nut muffins are on point. Potatoes are seasoned perfectly, I like them sour cream.  I've been going to Egg Works and Egg and I for over ten years. I've tried a lot of the things on the menu and it's all good.  Omelets are where my heart is but the carrot cake French toast-oui, OUI! So if you can get your hands on some do that! Thank me later! Dog friendly patios, great service...there are few places you can get a better breakfast. I don't think you can. I brought my parents here years ago and they STILL talk about it! I am a travel agent so whenever I come across someone coming to Vegas I recommend this place. This location dropped off banana bread to where I work as a gift and it was literally gone in ten minutes.",

The pancakes were OK but ranked last overall....it must be the LV water since we've not found a great pancake yet. There was definitely not a shortage of their signature potatoes...maybe a little too much at the table....the next time we might substitute one serving for something else. Pork chops were the breakfast cut size and was slightly too salty but that may be my preference...nevertheless they were a good change over typical sausages.  The banana muffin that was an option over the toast was very good.  Coffee was good and they left a carafe for refills.   Extremely friendly and efficient waitress and cashier topped everything off.",

Snobberlin's pampered pooches enjoy the patio, and their people seem to dig the food if the crowds are any indicator.   Servers are quite friendly and on top of their tables, though occasionally when it is busy you might wait a few minutes for a refill of water, coffee is provided by the jug. The \"happy\" or \"sad\" egg signs work to remedy  hiccups pretty swiftly.   Typical breakfast fare with seasonal specials thrown into the mix in a location close to the gym, where you can absolutely dine in workout gear is a plus. Friends are fans of the bottomless cups of Joe, pancakes, French Toast and hash browns, while I usually stick stick to building my own omelette or a crepe. Something for everyone, at a modest price served up in a non Big Box chain location to boot = a fan!  * they do serve lunch, but I've not tried it. Heard good things about the salads  . Open daily till 3PM *  * they are quite accommodating of substitutions *",

My wife ordered egg whites, with home fries and a banana nut muffin. I ordered Grandma's  Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, with the home fries. That was after a 10 minute wait.  We finally got our drinks a few minutes later.   Breakfast arrived 25 minutes later. My wife's egg whites were okay. The home fries were hard and not very tasty. The sausage gravy was lacking something, oh, yeah, sausage flavor. It tasted like flour and grease stirred up with some salt and pepper. The home fries have a weird spice flavor I didn't care for. I tasted them all day.  Nothing was hot. Tepid would be a good word.  The bill came faster than the flatware did, with a hefty total. Sausage  gravy w/ eggs and home fries and ice tea , egg whites and home fries and muffin and hot tea, and a juice. $28+.   Not what I expected from other reviews. Three strikes , I'm out. The door that is. Not letting it hit me either. Not going back.",

After we began to eat, dogs started to come in with their owners and we found that shortly we were surrounded by  two large dogs behind us and a small dog across from us. The flies were horrible ( flies do Love dogs) We quickly finished our meal then went to complain to the manager . All she said was  \" well everyone seems to LIKE bringing their dogs \"  Really ? What kind of answer is that ?  We went on to give reasons why this is NOT acceptable .....dogs bring flies, someone might be allergic to dogs, a small child might get bit, two dogs might fight , etc.  AND, why do residents of our community THINK it's OK ?  Don't they ever consider anyone else but themselves.? It's sad really to think our society is becoming so self centered !",

    "text": "Nice place but . . , I ordered the two fried eggs and potatoes.  Basic stuff, but the potatoes almost seemed deep fried and were way over spiced.  The spice dominated the entire breakfast it was so strong.  The egg was not cooked properly.  I asked for whites cooked, yoke runny, but both the yoke and whites were runny.  Charged an extra $1.75 for about 15 blue berries in son's pancake, which seemed excessive.   My wife was with me and liked her omelet, which looked good.    Coffee was good and pot was left at table which is nice.  I like the location.  We sat inside and it was not too loud.  No wait.",

Not much gets me to rate a place, but when I try how delicious these muffins are and they say they'll throw another in if I rate it, then I had to pull out my phone right then and there. Best muffins I've ever had! (And I'm not just saying that)",

Oh, and the menus that were like news papers was a perfect substitute for a common place and at times borish menu seen at other \"hot spots\". It was very avant-garde and new age. You could even say it was eggcellent. Server was Lisa C. and provided wonderful service!",
