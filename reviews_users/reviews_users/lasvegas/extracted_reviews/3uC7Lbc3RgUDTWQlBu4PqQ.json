I really need to adjust my expectations accordingly because due to the hype, I always associated Bouchon with all things awesome and so far, all my experiences have bordered only OK to meh (my other experiences: Bouchon Bakery in NYC & Bouchon in Bev Hills).   But I'm just mostly sad..the fool me once, fool me twice thing, now fooled me the third time!!! During our trip here for NYE2012, we had some time to kill before all the festivities and took a walk on the strip. I spotted Bouchon bakery and excitedly pointed out to my bestie that this place is suppose to have the BEST MACARONS! That got her all excited too so we picked up a pre-boxed of mini (6 for $12) to share a bunch of different flavors and bask in its glory.   The first 3 out of the box were straight up stale. We wouldn't have realized it until we got to the last 3 and realized how much better tasting those were. At $2 for each dinky one, that is unacceptable.   In the future, I would definitely question the pre-boxed stuff and ask how long it has been sitting there. The premium price tag should mean consistency.   I am disappoint.",

My chocolate almond croissant was amazzzzing but my mocha was just ok and I had to go back to re-ask for whipped cream because the barista forgot.   Glad I was finally able to try Bouchon Bakery even if I did pass on the macaroons, but I wouldn't say its a must have in Vegas considering all the other delicious things nearby.",

So I walked to the Venetian and found the bakery all the way at the other end from the entrance.  It is a small place, I saw different colored macarons: green, orange, white and brown macarons. So I asked what flavors were the macarons and he said pistachio, orange, vanilla and chocolate. So i got the vanilla and chocolate (original flavors) to see how they taste.  The macarons were a decent size, took about 4-5 bites to finish them. As I tried the vanilla... it was sooo good!!!! the inside is like eating ice cream and other outer layers was soft and a nice chewy texture.   The chocolate one was good too but it was too chocolatey and rich for me. But, i slowly finished it throughout the day.",

However I went in the morning at 8am and the line was already super long! Since I was leaving that day, I waited it out and scored myself a sticky bun, bread pudding, 12 macarons ( in those prepackages sets, so they were smaller than the individually sold ones) and a chai latte! ( Yes all for myself, though not all in one sitting! ha)   The sticky bun was delicious, but was very sweet. I thought the chai latte would complement the sticky bun well, but the chai latte was even SWEETER. Definitely will not get the chai latte from her again. When I got back home, I tried the bread pudding, and yummmmmm, it was delicious!!!   And the macarons, A MUST TRY. Enough said.",

    "text": "After visiting the Bouchon Bakery in Napa Valley, I just had to visit the one in Las Vegas when I was there. I brought my friends along because they wanted to see the huge macaroons. Be careful though because the place is pretty difficult to find (I even had trouble with the directions given by the Venetian associates).   The only thing I purchased at this Bouchon Bakery was the full set of MACAROONS (a total of six pieces). NOTE: If you buy 5 macaroons, you get 1 free. The macaroons were about $3.50 each.   I purchased a pre-packaged set of six macaroons, which containedVANILLA, PISTACHIO, RASPBERRY, COFFEE/CAPPUCHINO, CHOCOLATE (brownie?), AND A SPECIAL BOUCHON FLAVOR. Truthfully, since they were pre-packaged, I'm assuming the macaroons were made that day hopefully rather than the day before. Just to be safe, for anyone purchasing six, one of each flavor, go with the regular boxing where they grab the fresh ones made.   I wanted to bring it home to Orange County to enjoy with my boyfriend, so I stuck it in the trunk and drove on home with the others. Need I remind you it was summer, but I never would have thought anything would have happened to the macaroons, sensitive creatures they are.   Sad to say, never ever leave your macaroons out in heat, even if it's not in direct sunlight. Room temperature is best. Why? Because when I opened the truck, my poor chocolate/brownie macaroon sort of melted and oozed out this liquid and traveled down the box and ruined my other macaroons. Some were also cracked already (dang, sensitive pastries)!!!   They all looked horrific by now, so I dare not show them to my boyfriend. As a result, I enjoyed them by myself. :) :) :) Hahaha.  Anyways, onto the review of the tastings and enough of my ranting.   In the end, I prefer the Napa Valley Bouchon over this one.  Overall, all the flavors were actually perfect and light. The only thing I have to say about the CHOCOLATE/BROWNIE macaroon was that it was a little too dense and chocolatey (probably because of the melting though). My favorites were the VANILLA and PISTACHIO. The coffee one was alright. If you like coffee flavored pastries, you might like this one. As for the RASPBERRY, I never got to taste it. *sobs* I accidentally left it out and the dang ants got to them.   This was a bad luck batch of macaroons is all I'm saying. On my part though, not the bakeries.",

    "text": "My parents and I stopped into the location next  to the theatre early in the morning and we picked up a strawberry croissant, almond croissant, warmed ham and cheese croissant, and 6 large macarons to go. The strawberry one was almost too sweet for a breakfast item, very moist and dense with less strawberry presence than I expected. The almond croissant was delicious. And messy. Messy in the way that despite trying to shove it in my face, somehow I look down and there's debris everywhere. My dress, my arms...the table...yeah. But it's totally worthwhile, so get it!   The ham and cheese croissant feels very decadent, I don't think I could eat a whole one so I was glad it was split among three of us. As for the large macarons, they are buy five get one free, so with stars in my eyes I proceeded to order a box to go. These guys are texturally perfect- that thin crispiness that you break into before discovering the sweet chewiness, followed by a light buttercream filling. I didn't really care for the buttercream, but it was still good. Not Laduree absolute perfection good, but still good.   The customer service wasn't very friendly or welcoming, I perceived their attitudes more along the \"Ok what do you want\" lines, but it wasn't off putting, just could be better. Smile guys! I'd probably go back if I'm in he near vicinity again to try out the other pastries and cookies, but there's so many other places in Vegas that I probably wouldn't cry if I didn't return again.",

Rather, it is located off the grid of the Grand Canal Shops at the end of a long line of other shops and high-end restaurants.   It's a very small bakery. When I was there, there were only a few people there, so the line went fast. I got four macarons -- red velvet, chocolate, salted caramel, and pistachio.  The red velvet and chocolate were my favorites. The salted caramel and pistachio were okay, but they were too chewy and might have been chilled for a long time.  Other than that, the bakery itself was very quaint and cute. It offers other pastries as well, like cakes, croissants, danishes, and cupcakes. I would definitely come back here to try different goods!",

They're perfect.    Caramel, Chocolate, and Vanilla are my favorites but the Raspberry, Pistachio and Coffee are delectable too.  The flavors aren't as inventive as some larger bakeries with more offerings but between the chewy texture and the sumptuous buttercream, these are hard to beat.  One star revoked for the size, limited offerings, and tricky location (under the elevator near the theater.)",

    "text": "I visited as part of my search for my perfect French macaron locally. Bouchon macarons are about 3 times the size of a normal macaron but are also about 3x the price at $3+ a piece. But buy 5 and get 1 free. They do have the perfect texture, thin, crispy outer shell over the perfectly chewy center. The filling was just the right amount, but it was the filling that accounts for the 4 stars vs 5. It is good but it's a sweet buttercream type filing even in the raspberry. I prefer a real fruit filling with a little tart to it. Overall, they are delicious and I would recommend. If you prefer the fruit filling tart as well I'd recommend checking out La Belle Terre bakery on W. Sahara.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Bouchon Bakery after reading about Thomas Keller and salivating over the pictures on Yelp.  Imagine my surprise when I found out that it was just a tiny little stand (no seating) at the base of the escalators in the Venetian.  No matter--I loaded up and took it upstairs to the food court area and then indulged, Vegas style.  Here's what I got:  -Chocolate macaron: (5/5) Chewy and dense, this reminded me of what would happen if a cookie and brownie had a love child.   -Carrot cake sandwich: (4/5)  Two carrot cake \"cookies\" with the frosting sandwiched between. It was very good, although the edges were slightly dried out.  I did go in the afternoon, and I assume the stuff was sitting out for a while, though.    -Chocolate Chip cookie: (3/5)   -Roast beef sandwich: (5/5) The chewy bread, the PERFECT roast beef, and something sweet mixed in there (caramelized onions perhaps? idk) was just heaven.    -Chocolate bouchon: Cute and tiny. I didn't get to try this one, but was told it was very very good!  -Chocolate croissant:  (5/5)  This was the least oily croissant I've had, so it took me a while to get used to it.  I really liked the flakiness of the shell and the excellent dark chocolate inside.    -TKO--The Thomas Keller Oreo (3/5)  I didn't really enjoy this that much. I thought the cookie was light and yummy, but the inside filling didn't do it for me. But perhaps that's because I don't like oreos to begin with. Why did I get this? Idk. I guess I read so much about it on Yelp.  I would only get this if you like oreos.  I do not crave sweet sugary foods (except for fruit!), but I'm glad I tried Bouchon bakery.  I'll be back next time to grab another sandwich and perhaps try more of their sweets!  *See pics*",

And, when I took my first bite, I fell in love. The macaron was crispy yet airy on the inside, and chewy filled with delicious cream in the middle. The macaron was absolutely perfect, and I had no complaints about it.   However, when I visited Bouchon again this week, I was disappointed in the size of the macarons. Their macaron size now is very inconsistent, some were larger than others, and overall, the macarons had shrunk. When I ordered a box back in June, all the macarons were in perfect uniformity. Now, some were small, while other flavors were larger.  I also tried the turkey sandwich, and fell in love. The bread has cranberries/raisins, and when toasted, it was a perfect complement to the turkey and brie cheese. I got this sandwich every morning and am still not sick of it.  I plan on trying the other pastries when I visit Las Vegas again, but I hope that the macarons will not disappoint. Thank goodness the macarons still taste the same...",

I originally started coming here for their namesake dessert - the chocolate bouchons - tasty brownie bites shaped like corks or bouchons. On my most recent trip, I discovered more tasty treats.  The macarons are perfect french meringue cookies that are light, crisp, filled and oh so delish. My daughter and I both love the chocolate flavor while the hubbs likes the pistachio flavor.   Also, Bouchon's croissants are baked to perfection. We tried both the pain au chocolate and a special flavor, almond chocolate. Talk about flaky, chocolatey perfection.   Don't forget to bring home some of the homemade preserves that they serve at the restaurant. These change seasonally and make a great souvenir gift!",

I liked the cream filling in the middle, opposed to the jelly filling that most other restaurants will have in their raspberry macarons. I also got a s'mores cupcake, and it was only above average.

Honestly, if you're going to help people, especially excited and eager people that are already sold on the product you offer, don't roll your eyes blatantly in front of us because we ordered more than three things.

My latest visit came after a one-month, self-imposed sugar ban.  And, because I love these trendy little cakes so much, I chose to break my fast on a Bouchon chocolate cupcake!  The basis for my obsession is that the frosting will not put you into a diabetic coma.  The sweetness is doable. Further, the chocolate frosting tastes more like a mousse, less like a birthday cake.   If I wanted a cupcake that tastes like birthday cake, I'll make it myself (and you do not want to see me bake...scary).  And, at $3.50, these are a pretty good deal -- smaller, less delicious cupcakes in Las Vegas can be had for $2.50.  The selection, however, is limited--I've only ever seen chocolate and red velvet.  Both are good.  Bouchon Bakery is a great way to experience Thomas Keller without dropping a few hundred at his restaurant upstairs.  I do wish they'd serve up some tables though! What is up with that!?! Come on!",

Service:  Very nice - friendly counter person who generously gave me the last 2 broken raspberry macarons for free (I purchased 6 as a gift already) - me and my 3 year old had a very nice treat! :)  Not so nice - brusque and aggressive counter person who scoffed at a sweet teen girl's unique name (not traditionally American) in front of me?

I was just starving so I wanted something small to hold me over until dinner time... plus, I'll never turn away from a grilled cheese. Note: They have to \"heat up\" the oven and that took ten minutes. What I really liked most about their grilled cheese sandwich was that it wasn't greasy! What I didn't understand was why they call it a grilled cheese if it's not grilled, they put it in the oven to melt the cheese. Anyway, I enjoyed it nonetheless.   French Macarons - Yes, this was what I came here for!! I'm drooling thinking about Macarons as I write this. The Macarons here are bigger than the average size Macarons you buy anywhere else.

And so since the Bouchon Bakery was just near the lifts to the rooms, I thought I'd nip right downstairs for a quick pastry and hot tea for myself and my friend. Oh boy, it was 9am and there was already a long line waiting to place orders. Thank goodness they have a system of taking orders while you're in line so that you get your order and pay for it by the time you get to the cashier around the corner.   Unfortunately, as I found out, when you place your order from around the corner, unless you already know what's being displayed at the front of the counter, you will only have seen the several awesomely delicious looking pastries on display......and likely have missed everything else at the front counter display around the corner. There were a few more items such as cookies, breakfast croissant and French baguette sandwiches, yoghurt, mixed fruit cups, etc. Yea, I could've added the items to my order, but it was so busy and I didn't want to get dirty looks from the customers in line behind me....plus everybody behind he counter was so busy that I didn't want to bother them......plus, I had already ordered more than enough.   I ordered one raisin danish (ok, they called it something raisin in French, but I forget the name and spelling) and a blueberry muffin. Yes, they were both totally fresh and yummy! However, the raisin pastry I thought was a bit thin so you don't get the full usual fluffiness of the inside.....the outer crisp was nice and light though. The blueberry muffin was very good too....and both not as sweet as I thought they'd be, which I was glad about.",

They are so delicious. The salted caramel flavor has real caramel. They are a good size too so you can share with others if you want to get a variety to try. I also got a Kouign Amann which was really good! The only downfall is that we asked for one vanilla macaron and instead the worker gave us a raspberry. I guess I'll just have to go back and try it! ;D",

We stopped in here for breakfast knowing it was a Thomas Kellar establishment and we weren't disappointed.    By far the best danish and best blueberry muffin I have had in my life. The basket was fairly priced too.  I would go back for just the muffins.    Other food was good too. Well cooked and tastey.  You can't go wrong coming here for breakfast. My only complaint was the sticky bun was overdone. Like way overcooked and crunchy. Too bad",

Locations: - Venetian Theater - Clock Tower - Casino/Sports Book  The listing shows all three locations, but there are separate pages for the Clock Tower and Casino bakeries. Ugh. This bakery is directly in front of the Venetian Theater under the escalators.  Anyway, this location tends to be the busiest as I'm sure it's the most known and there's a lot of foot traffic from the Venetian parking garage and the casino.

They have all the baked goods that the other locations have. I was surprised, though, that I did not find the coffee as good as when I went to their main sit-down location two days prior. It tasted a little burnt, maybe? It was certainly drinkable but not as divine.  Either way, I would not hesitate to come back to this location, as it was fast and more central to the casino happenings. It doesn't have the same ambiance as the other locations, of course, but it's great if you're on the go.",

To bite into the perfectly baked crunchy yet chewy cookie then taste the incredible filling...it's heavenly.  My old favorite was Earl Grey, but I recently tried the Peanut butter and jelly which is....Amaziiing!!! They now make large macarons, as well as my favorite little ones. The vanilla bean, pistachio, strawberry, and chocolate are all  fantastic. Always grab at least on sea salt caramel, they are superbly delicious.

Since I am such a snob, I always buy 2 macarons first to test them. Bouchon Bakery passed with flying colors...tried the salted caramel and raspberry, eventually bought 5 more (got the 6th FREE).  The macarons ($3.50 ea) are light yet chewy, just the way I like them. The salted caramel filling is a bit chewy too which I like, the raspberry and the rest had the normal frosting type filling. We also tried the chocolate and pistachio flavors but don't think I'd order them again because there was not enough flavor in them.  Went to the Aria to check out the macs at Jean Philippe but they only sold them in pre-packaged boxes of 6. They were also very tiny in size. Didn't even bother, if I can't taste one or two first, I don't partake...yes I am a snob.  Think you'll be happy at Bouchon, the service was kind and helpful...but more importantly, the macs were divine!",

Macaroons are about $3, but so worth it and they are also bigger than most. I decided on the salted caramel and pistachio ones and they just melt in your mouth. I got there right after they opened so it was fresh and new for me to try. It was light, chewy and not overly sweet. I also ordered the bacon and caramelized onion croissant and it was delicious!! The caramelized onions were my favorite, I could have ate just a cup of that but the croissant made it taste even better.   They had alot of other delicious options that I had to say no to since I knew I was running the half marathon later that day. But they had cupcakes, cookies, cakes, croissants and other breakfast items along with drinks. Everything looked delicious and I will be sure to come back here when I come back to Vegas. It's definitely not cheap, but worth it! They are quite addicting too...dangerously delicious!",

You be the judge. In any case, I love this place. You can't get better quality baked goods anywhere else. The end.",

This location is a bit hard to find but make sure to ask one of the workers and they'll gladly point you in the right direction to go.  Once you go in, it's only a small store but it does have a lot of items. There is a variety of macarons at $3.50 a piece. A little on the expensive side, but well worth what you pay for. They also have a variety of other pastries, cookies, and cakes. I only tried their Pistachio macaron and it was ah-mazing. I have tried many macarons but I have never had one that was this perfect before. The cookie had a nice dome on the outside and the inside was soft without the chewy-ness of it being under-done. It melted in my mouth! So good! Next time, I'll definitely try more!   I'm hungry for more! Thank you Bouchon!",

I've been here twice and I still like it far more than the Beverly Hills location.  During my last trip to Vegas in October, we came here spontaneously after LAVO Brunch. They have various desserts, including giant and mini macarons, giant cookies, cake, and other pastries. Currently, if you buy 5 giant macarons, you get one free. It's obviously a better deal than the box of six mini macarons, but the mini ones definitely look a lot more appetizing.  After much contemplation, I got a box of six mini macarons for $15. The flavors included were pistachio, pumpkin, vanilla, sea salt caramel, and coffee, which were all very, very good. Amazing flavoring, texture, and consistency; the outer egg-shell like crust was perfectly thin, airy, and the inner had a soft, almost meringue texture. Hands down, the best macarons I've ever had, and they were still really good in the evening after leaving them out of the fridge for the entire day. They were so good, I finished all six in one sitting...  If you're looking for delectable macarons in Vegas, come here!",

When I visited New York City last November (2012) I've been on the hunt for awesome macaroons because I've never really liked them until I tasted it there and one of the places I've tried was Bouchon Bakery.  This past trip to Vegas (Oct. 2013) me and the boyfriend and some friends stayed at the Palazzo and the 1st day we arrived, we past by Bouchon bakery on the bottom of Venetian hotel so you know I had to get me some macaroons...yes, it's a little pricey for just one but come on' they are awesome macaroons and the macaroons are actually big and fluffy and creamy and sweet and delicious! I made my boyfriend buy me macaroons from here and the Bouchon bakery next to the Venetian theater everyday we were in Vegas....yes it's that good! I tried the salted caramel, vanilla, seasonal and pistachio flavor but any flavor is legit good!...The lemonade drink is also refreshingly yummy!",

    "text": "Quite possibly my most favoritest place in Vegas.  I found it on my last trip in March of 2009 and tasted the best cheese danish I have ever had in my life.  Flaky pastry...delicious (not too sweet sweet) cheese...in perfect ratio.  This weekend, I revisited only to be completely impressed with the chocolate tart.  Super chocolately without being overwhelming and the tart was the perfect texture, not too thick or chewy with just the right amount of crispness.  It was so good, I brought one back home for my hubby and he loved it.  I will say though, that I did try the huge red velvet cupcake once and that was not perfect.  It was a little dry on the inside.  While I wouldn't call the prices affordable, they are low by Vegas standards and in line with prices for such things in San Francisco.  I won't be going back to Vegas anytime soon, but in the meantime, I'll just dream about this place until Thomas Keller one day realizes that the residents of SF would probably swarm this place.",

Decided on a carrot cake cookie sandwich and a chocolate macaroon.  I am not a big macaroon fan, but decided to try one of these because everyone says it's the thing to get here.  Well...yeah, still not a macaroon fan but it was alrite.  Carrot cake cookie sandwich on the other hand was mighty fine.

The TKO is like a big Oreo cookies but a super high class & fancy distant cousin. The 2 chocolate cookies had the perfect blend of crunchiness and cocoa flavor. The cream in the middle is amazing. The sweetness & sugar crystals are so smooth & perfect texture with a soft organic creme aroma. What type of butter or cream did you use? Taste expensive. Your macaroons are big & perfect amount of chewiness & crunch. It's still one of my favorites across the nation, comparing to Paulettes in LA or sleek macaroon shops in NYC. The macaroons can get too sweet sometimes, so just make sure you enjoy it with coffee or milk. But I do love your raspberry and blueberry macaroons as I can taste the fresh fruit in all parts & not just the filling. Well, all I know is that whenever I'm in Napa or Vegas, I shall always come & visit you.",

When I was at the Vegas Venetian, the sales clerk told me that if I bought 5 large macarons, I would receive a set of (5?) mini macarons.  Great, I thought...I was going to get some for family so I bought 15 large ones, expecting 3 sets of mini-macs.  When I got back to my hotel room in another hotel down the strip, I realized the sales clerk gave me NO mini-macarons...NONE.  I was going to catch a plane in about 1.5 hours, and to walk back there might have been pretty tight.  I called over and left a voicemail.  I expected them to at least call me back, but I never heard a word.  Boy, was I sorely disappointed at the customer service.  I love Bouchon NYC, and like LA very much.  I was a big fan of Bouchon.  But after this experience, I am pretty \"meh\" now on the brand...no matter how much I liked their macarons.  Sigh.  Really disappointed.",

As a self proclaimed macaron connoisseur, I have to say that Bouchon macarons are nice because they don't use jelly fillings.  I kind of hate jelly filled or jelly based fillings for macarons because they taste too sweet.  Bouchon macarons are of a buttercream persuasion, but not too buttery like others I have tasted in the Bay Area.  Perfect crunch, perfect chewiness, perfect light tasting filling.",

The only other places I've had them are Vanilla Bakeshop in Santa Monica and Europane in Pasadena. I'm going off on a quest to search for macarons better than these in LA. Bring it!  I bought the set of flavors here, and it was totally worth it to try all the flavors! Now I know which ones are my favorite...and they have to be Raspberry, Vanilla Bean, and Coffee. I think these flavors are more fragrant and they coffee has a deep earthy coffee taste to it, just how a coffee flavor should be. The lemon and orange were a little too sweet for me, and I just somehow don't like the citrus flavored macarons as much. And I never had a thing for chocolate flavored anything, so take my opinions with my preferences in mind.  The shells are very delicate, as they crack quite easily, but the crunch had just enough soft chew too, and on top of the cream or ganache inside, it was heavenly!   I also tried the carrot cake cookie and it was okay. I think the carrot cake could have been more moist. The cream cheese filling was good though. =) There was also a really cute sweets stand next to this stand. Oh, and Bouchon Bakery is not a store. It's literally like a little stand! Downstairs by the casinos and the Phantom of the Opera Theater is where you'll find it. =) And make sure you get there before they close if you want to buy anything. My mom was saying we should go there right before our POTO show started for some dessert after dinner, but I thought that was a huge mistake and made us go in the afternoon before we went outlet shopping and dinner. THANK GOD. It was closed when we came back to watch our show.  [Phantom of the Opera was amazing too! But that's beside the point... :)]  If you're a macaron fan, definitely try theirs. Overpriced, but you'll forget about that once you try it. =D",

My original plan of getting just a sandwich turned into a sandwich, a raspberry macaroon(which was surprising because I swore I'd never have another one after my first taste of one from Jean Phillipe), a la madeleine, and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice.    The orange juice was ok.  It had no pulp which always makes me question whether it really is \"fresh squeezed\" but it tasted fine.  My sandwich, turkey in a sweet twisted bread was incredible.  I'd say that's the best sandwich I've had in my life.   The best part of the entire meal though was definitely the raspberry macaroon.  Like I said, I swore against all macaroons for eternity but they just looked so pretty and scrumptious that I caved.  One of the best decisions of my life.  That cookie was everything that I imagined macaroons would be like and more. The outside slightly crunchy with a soft, moist center that just makes you so happy you decided not to share.  I couldn't shut up about this cookie and thank goodness there are a couple locations here in CA so I won't have to wait to go to Vegas every time I'm craving the macaroons.",

I thought the chocolate was too sweet but everything else was pleasant. They didn't taste good at all the next day, so stuff yourself before they get stale.",

I paid them a visit, twice :) The bread pudding was SO good and the chocolate Bouchon amazing! What a nice treat this morning, accompanied by a non fat latte. Later in the day I had another and tried a double chocolate cookie, everything looked amazing. This is the perfect place for breakfast or a tasty treat. I can't wait to try Bouchon next time I'm in town. I wanted to order one of everything to bring home with me. Fabulous!",

My friend loves the Kouign amann. I never know how to pronoun it. I seriously butcher the name each time.  The first time I got here, they sold out the Kouign amann. It was November 2017, Thanksgiving day. I visited Vegas a month later and called around 9 AM to reserve the pastries. They require it to be paid prior, so have your credit card ready when you order.  2 pastries come out to be $9.01. At the time of arrival, I noticed they didn't sell out and I didn't have to pre-order...I guess you never know.",

However, since it carries Thomas Keller's name as an offshoot of Bouchon Bistro, which is an excellent spot for a meal, it doesn't quite measure up.  The turkey sandwich comes with cheddar(?), onion, and watercress on pecan bread. It was ok - you can tell the ingredients are good - but the sandwich itself wasn't outstanding. Most of the items seem to just miss the mark: the bacon(?), egg, and cheese croissant comes with a beautiful, fat slice of omelet but it's topped with a thin sliver of cheese; the Cobb salad is huge but bacon wasn't listed as an ingredient so I passed on that.  The macarons are a nice size, great for splitting with a friend, and the croissants are buttery without feeling greasy. I'll be back for that Kouign Amann.",

    "text": "Perfection in terms of baked goods. I'm always tempted by the goodies here anytime I'm in Vegas for the weekend. It doesn't help that I always stay at the Venetian or Palazzo.   What I usually get: - Macarons: these are PURE PERFECTION. They also have a super cute box of mini macarons of 6 for $18 - Kouign Amann: I've been on a Great British Bakeoff kick lately and this was one of the challenges. I was curious to know what it tasted like, so I jumped at a chance to try it when I saw it. This was so flaky, sweet, crispy, delicate. I really like Bouchon's version (that lamination!) - Epi bread: If you've ever eaten at Bouchon, you know their version of baguette bread. Sprinkled with a little water, and a few minutes in the toaster oven and it's like you're eating it fresh! Or you can just eat it fresh in your hotel room. I always ask them for butter and jam to go.  - Chocolate Chip Cookie: this is a chocolate chip cookie. It's literally perfect. It's got the crispy edges, the sharp bitter chocolate, the chewy and tender inside. When I crave a chocolate chip cookie, this is the one I want.   Pros: - Literally everything in the display case looks freaking amazing, and taste delicious. DELICIOUS!  - Perfect snack to nibble on during the drive back home  Cons: - Great deliciousness comes with great price. It's not as cheap as your corner donut shop, but honestly, why not treat yourself a little during your stay in Vegas? DO IT! TREAT YO'SELF!  Would I come again? I ALWAYS DO! #carblife",

As others have noted the service wasn't the friendliest. There isn't any seating inside, but have a patio outside with 7-8 tables which was ok since it was a pleasant morning. The issue is there are pigeons lurking everywhere. They will walk right under your feet, occasionally bumping into you. It was incredibly annoying and l couldn't wait to finish up and get going. I know they cannot control nature, but it soured the experience.  3 stars for the food and service, and I'd highly recommend looking for a place inside the Venetian to sit.",

It took quite the effort to find but it was well worth it. Bouchon is two stories and has a nice outside patio seating area on the first floor.The only downfall to this place is there is no inside seating.  There were many pastry and drink options available on their menu including a TKO(Thomas Keller Oreo) and TLC(Oatmeal Pecan Cookie) that are unique to Bouchon. I didn't read about these gems until after we ordered but they seem to be a crowd favorite. I ordered a Almond Croissant, pistachio macaron, and Iced Chai. If you are a Chai lover, this is one is a must!  The almond croissant was a little dry and flaky on the corners but was delicious. The pistachio macaron was massive and tasted great. They had a handful of other flavors including pumpkin in November, so I imagine there are other seasonal flavors offered at different times of the year.",

First of all it was my first Kouign Amann ($7.50) experience ever, and omg. It was as hard as a rock from the outer crisp caramelized layer to the inside of it which is suppose to be rich/buttery and cake like. Such a disappointment. Also decided to try their macarons; a vanilla and a pistachio ($3.50ea) Honestly the most expensive macarons I've ever got, and I wouldn't have minded the price if it was worth it. Shell was sad and filling was overly sweet. Overall mediocre macarons with a price tag that only Laduree should have. Don't waste your time coming here.

I LOVE breads and desserts from Bouchon, that's where I'd spend my dollar dollar bill, y'all!   In this review, I'm going to focus on their macarons, the French sandwich cookie (NOT macarOOns, the cookies with coconut). I get irritated when people label their cookie pics incorrectly.   It's hard to resist macarons, airy and delicately crisp, so I bought a box of six minis and six large ones (buy 5, get one free). I love the sweet, creamy filling but their flavors were not very exciting - vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, salted caramel,  raspberry. How about matcha tea? Blueberry? Black Sesame? Or how about Champagne? They need more colorful macarons!Nevertheless, I enjoyed the French cookies but I don't need to get two boxes next time. I'd rather stock up on the breads.  Total: ~$34",

We ordered the salted caramel, pistachio, and coffee flavors. I think the coffee one was the best since it wasn't too sweet. Caramel was the sweetest and got difficult to eat near the end since each bite got worse and worse. It was the first time that I wish my macaron was actually smaller than bigger!  Overall I'd probably skip this place next time I'm back and try out a different bakery!",

Their pastries are so ridiculously good - you really can't go wrong with anything on display. Their macaroons are monster and the size of your face, but my favorites here are the croissants. The almond croissant, the chocolate, and my personal fave - the strawberry croissant are all to die for. Perfect flakiness, sweetness, and the texture of the smooth strawberry filling...omg. Who needs cronuts when you have croissants like these! They make a solid brew as well and the service was friendly.  A definitely go-to whenever I'm in Vegas and around the Venetian!",

We found it on Yelp, but got lost trying to find it. Bouchon offers a small variety of baked goods ranging from cookies to yogurt parfaits and cute macarons. We didn't order any of the baked goods but ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate. The drinks weren't anything spectacular; they scored below average for me. The hot chocolate was made out of milk but it tasted funcky. For Bouchon, I expected chocolate decadence, but I got none of that. The only good thing about the drink was the temperature because it was chilly and I depended on it to keep warm.",

The Bouchon restaurant is at the 10th floor of the Venetian, which I was super confused with after reading these reviews initially.   So let's review the bakery first:   1) BOUCHON BAKERY - (little stand) This is a line-up grab & go service.  They serve a variety of delicious cookies, cupcakes, and pastries as well as coffees & other hot drinks.  The stuff they have is delicious.  Definitely try their almond croissant and their chocolate croissant.  Their chocolate croissant even beats Jean Phillipe (at the Bellagio).  If you've got an insane sweet tooth, then try the apple croissant.  I wouldn't suggest that one for breakfast though b/c it was way too sweet for my liking.   2) BOUCHON RESTAURANT - 10th floor of the Venetian  So like everywhere in the Vegas hotels, you take a convoluted route before you can actually find your final destination because everything here is so big.  However, this restaurant was well worth the convoluted trip.  There is a huge variety of brunch options including quiches, pastries, eggs, etc.  I like that they can do your eggs *any* style and they mean it - including scrambled egg whites - my favourite.  I also ADORED their chocolate croissant - it was seriously delicious.  They have that downstairs at the bakery too.    So overall, a great find and definitely worth going again!",

    "text": "Yet another disappointment on my yelp list for this winter break. I don't know if it was because I came at 9PM for macarons but they were not the best as my friend had promised. I did the buy 5 get 1 free deal for the large ones (the smaller ones would've only cost a dollar less which made me ??? oh well) and got eggnog, salted caramel, pistachio, chocolate, and raspberry. Out of all the flavors, salted caramel was definitely the best, then pistachio, chocolate, raspberry, and eggnog. All of the macarons were too crunchy for my liking. The shells were slightly dried out and didn't have the chewiness I like biting into. And the flavors themselves weren't that vibrant. I didn't feel like I got the pure taste of each flavor in the macarons sadly.   Honestly such a let down but what saved the trip to Bouchon for me was the chocolate almond croissant. I never thought I could like a croissant so much, but this one hit the spot. Even though it took me a full 5 days to finish the croissant, I thoroughly enjoyed every chocolatey bite and correct me if I'm wrong but I think there was also a spread of coconut in between the flakey buttery layers. The croissant didn't go stale and tasted a million times better lightly toasted in the convection oven.   So definitely come here for the chocolate almond croissant. Maybe swing by earlier in the day for fresher macarons? But my past macaron experiences have been much better than Bouchon (they tasted way better and lasted a lot longer) so take caution before you shell out about $3 a cookie.",

Regardless, the macarons seem pricey, but they're about as big as my palm, so it's well worth it.  They have pretty tasty macarons, but I wouldn't go as far as to say they're the best you can find -- maybe for Vegas though.  I was considering giving this place four stars, but I couldn't really justify it.  But I still feel like five is a lot, so for accuracy, I'll say it's four-and-a-half stars.",

We stayed at the Venetian, so it was a really easy trip down to the lobby, passed by beautiful Phantom and boom, Bouchon bakery. Not to be confused with the actual bistro upstairs. I love Thomas Keller's stuff, and this is a cheaper way to experience his food. Seriously. He's not the biggest dessert guy, but he is very particular with his food, so it can't be bad.   The macarons are HUGE and typical me bought a box of 6 different flavors. I spread the love of course because I'm pretty sure I'd get a stomach ache from all that sugar. The lemon one was surprisingly delicious (not usually a lemon fan) and I've heard good things about the pistachio even though they didn't have it the day I went :(",

We trekked back with a chocolate croissant and a sticky bun on a 2-hour flight and enjoyed them with a glass of milk at home.  Perfect way to end the day that once began in Vegas!",

You are maybe entitled to work on a 31 at of December, but a smile at breakfast is a minimum for clients. On the service side you are certainly. Very close to the French lol",

We got a wide selection of items: chocolate almond croissant, pain au raisin, strawberry croissant, chocolate croissant, beignet, pecan roll, and a few others that I can't remember. The only things that I really liked were the strawberry croissant that had a streusel on top and the beignet. I thought everything else tasted a little dry. BTW the latte was really good. Overall the prices weren't bad considering you're inside a casino in Vegas and everything is more expensive. I thought the majority of the pastries were better than average but not as good as any basic pastry shop in a Paris train stop. I don't think I would go out of my way to stop there, but would stop if it was on my way. Frankly the croissant shop around the corner from my house makes a lighter, fluffier and tastier croissant, but their coffee sucks. After reading some if the other posts, I wish I would have gotten a macaroon but I couldn't justify paying $3.50 for one. There's an italian bakery in San Francisco's little italy that makes these and sells them for less than a $1 a piece and they're perfect. Although they're a little smaller.",

    "text": "4 Stars: Yay! I'm a fan.  Thomas Keller pretty much gets a free pass on GP, but Bouchon Bakery is nice because for not much more than the price of your hotel starbucks, you get decadent baked goods that are worth waiting at least 4-6 minutes in line for.   I'm not certain you can go wrong with any of the baked goods here unless you are super picky about your preferences on the way certain baked goods are prepared, or if you are just being troublesome for the sake of having a more cultured palate than everyone in your circle.   I find it a little humorous that you can buy pain epi that are complimentary at Bouchon proper. If you've eaten these, you may have a sardonic grin on your face right about now. I've contemplated purchasing these a la carte before. I've also stuffed my face with about a dozen of these at the bistro.  My only qualms are with the line, which at peak times can be ridiculous, the servers, who can be inattentive or somewhat forgetful when it comes to your order or requests that accompany your order, and that not all items are available year round, especially some of the fruit preserves, and without a website, or public forum to announce availability, sometimes you just need to call beforehand to see if they have something you are looking for. Also, they run out of things, which is a given considering it's not a huge location. They are a little counter tucked under a stairwell.  But certainly add this place to your list of early morning haunts. I'd rank it above Payard, below Jean Philippe Patisserie. So it's good.  And make sure you buy a bag of bouchons (6 for $10) to go and don't forget to ask for a little bit of raspberry sauce on the side. Heat those puppies up in the oven for a few minutes, pour some of the raspberry sauce on top, make obscene noises while consuming.",

Sinfully decadent is what I would describe this comparatively-little stall. The glass case held dozens of different pastry treats and I had a lot of trouble trying to decide what to have. As much as the brownies and chocolate offerings were extremely tempting, I had to be practical and got two ham and cheese baguettes and two coffees for me and Mr. J.   Cheap, it is not. The two sandwiches and coffees cost $25. The quality was great so you are paying for a good product. The cost was worth it for me because this is one of the few places (and times) that I can experience the influence of Thomas Keller. If you're a foodie like I am, you should try to hit this place up when you're in Vegas.",

For $2 it looks quite dinky, but it is a small price to pay for the amazingness that it brings. Seriously... it's like the perfect little chocolate cake!   Tried some of my cousin's bread pudding. As good as any bread pudding I've ever had, even though I'm not a huge fan of bp to begin with.  The strawberry croissant, though innovative, was a little too sweet for my taste. Don't be deceived by its flatness. Even though it is a little unsightly, I think you'll be satisfied.  Had a few bites of the pistachio macaron. Not bad, but I'd stick with the morning pastries for guaranteed satisfaction.   Wish I had enough time/room/money for the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo), almond brioche, beignets, etc etc.",

I also wanted to get the seasonal orange one, but I had my work cut out for me just eating those 6 alone. I actually didn't eat them as soon as I bought them, I refrigerated a few of them for about a day and they were still amazing! They were crisp on the outside and slightly doughy in the middle. They weren't overly sweet either. My favorite was probably either the pistachio or coffee flavored ones.   I also got the red velvet cupcake, since so many others seemed to really like it. I didn't care for it that much. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The cupcake is hollowed out and filled with their cream cheese frosting and it was just a bit too much frosting for me. The cake itself is very moist though.  Next time I'm in the area, I'll end up stopping by, but mainly for the macarons. Yum!",

I've made the cookies following his recipes and I  really liked them but the ones at the store were incredibly bitter and the filling wasn't any better.  I'll still probably stop by to try more things though.",

I would personally recommend getting (in addition to a box of macarons) the chocolate croissant, the chocolate bouchons, and the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo).",

    "text": "I'm actually rounding up - in reality, I'd only give it 2.5 stars.  However, I award stars relative to what I expect of a particular establishment, based on it's sister restaurants, press, chef, and overall reputation.  Being the baby sister to the high-end, uber-famous French Laundry under the keen eye of masterful chef Thomas Keller, one should expect a modicum of basic service standards in a restaurant with such a pedigree.  However, the food and service were disappointingly mediocre at best.  Aside from the incredible pastries and outdoor ambiance, this restaurant leaves nothing to be desired.  For those of you unfamiliar with the ridiculous parking-garage, elevator-changing, treasure-hunt required to find the restaurant, prepare yourselves.  Once you have finally made your way to the entrance, it is likely you will be graciously greeted by a host/manager, then asked to wait (reservations are not allowed for breakfast/brunch).  My average wait time on a weekend has been pretty close to the quoted time, which is definitely a plus on their behalf.  However, once seated (even with empty tables all around) we were promptly greeted with water service, but then waited over 10 minutes for a waiter to offer other beverages.  Even after the beverage order, drinks were painfully slow to arrive - the waiter actually made it back to our table to take our food order before bringing our drinks.  Let me reiterate that the food here is delicious, without debate.  However, I wasn't prepared to spend the entire afternoon here, regardless of the beautiful weather and our outside seating.  It took over 45 minutes for 4 brunch items, one of which was a fruit plate, and none of which required pre-ordering or long cooking times (ie. well done meats or souffles).  During our wait, we had to ask for everything we needed, except for water refills & the bussers were very attentive.  However, the server had to constantly be flagged down or requested through the busser, as he stood idly around the corner completely oblivious to what was happening at our table.  He ignored the need for:  rounds of cocktails, missing silverware/linens, plates for sharing (after being asked twice), and our second food order (of which we had also made mention).  For such a highly regarded restaurant and world-renown chef, it would seem likely that with all of the out-of-work professional waiters vying for a job, that Thomas Keller would be able to hire someone slightly more competent.  As a local, food quality is important, but so is value - especially if I am expected to trek to the strip and brave the crowds of tourists and labyrinth parking garage.  Value for me includes service.  Perhaps we would have had a better experience with any other server, but this particular experience really tainted my ability to give an otherwise above average restaurant more than 2.5 stars.",

Chocolate covered pistachio macarons WHAT WHAT? I ate half of it when I got it and then the other half much later that night drunk while laying on my side (AKA \"Hasselhoffing it\"- it was delicious both ways.) I also have a weakness for fancy bakery versions of Oreos and the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo) delivered! Super dark barely sweet chocolate cookie with delicious ganache inside, mmmm. I also got a cheese danish to eat later and it was delicious even though it was all crushed in my bag for a couple days. I ended up eating it at the airport waiting for my delayed flight and I was so tired and miserable I ate that thing like a beast with no napkin and no shame, the guy next to me had to be disgusted. It wasn't your regular danish (which is flat) but tall like a roll FULL OF DELICIOUS CHEESE with a little bit of lemon flavor and delicious flaky crustiness. My friend loaded up on strawberry croissants to eat and take home to her husband so if you don't hate strawberry (like me!) then those are apparently a must try item as well.",

I'm having the strawberry macaron... it is too sweet, the strawberry flavor too subtle, and the consistency too soft (i.e., not enough chew or crisp).  I'm no macaron connoisseur (yet), but I can tell that it should be better.  The price, however, is very reasonable: a little under $20 for 6 different types that are about 2-3 times the size of a typical macaron.  Hopefully the other flavors are better.  3.4 stars: 0.4 for value and so I don't have to round up to 4.",

There were 6 of them and they were the biggest macarons I have ever eaten.  I loved all of them except for the red one, which I'm guessing was raspberry.  Location was convenient since we were staying at The Venetian. Good service and lots of variety to choose from.

Im not a coffee person so i gave it away. I'm somewhat a chocolate person but maybe it was too chocolatey for me. Overall they are BOMB!",

Every time we would go to Valleyfair he'd mention that they sold the mix for some of the items on the menu at Bouchon Bakery, but I never caved.  So he hooks me with the promise of chocolate and leads the way to the little Bouchon Bakery stand. He gets Macaroons, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Oatmeal Cookies, an Almond Croissant and Bouchons of course.  I loved every single one!!!! I wish I lived in Vegas just so I could overindulge.  Needless to say, once we got back home and went to Valleyfair..we bought up the lot of Bouchon mix :)",

The macarons are very good (the pistachio and chocolate were exquisitely made and the quality of the ingredients shined in every bite). They are expensive ($4+ each) but they are of the 'large' variety and any sane person would be completely satiated with just one (i of course had to have 3...).   The only thing I had here that i didn't completely enjoy was the 'nutter butter' sandwich cookie..i will not blame Bouchon Bakery for this however as I had no business ordering this type of American style/flavor treat here. If i truly wanted a nutter butter i should have gone to 7-11 convenience store.   Highly recommend. Another tip: there is NO better dinner party, housewarming, or 'i was thinking of you' gift than a box of macarons (*hint* to any of my friends that may be reading this).",

It's actually located near the Phantom of Opera show. Right behind the escalators.   The french macarons are 3.50 a pop. Well worth it. It's not the best I've had but well worth it. I got the pistachio and chocolate flavors. I loved the pistachio ones. The chocolate ones were okay, very moist and brownie like. I also got the TKO cookie. Eh, didn't really like it. But the macarons are yummy!  I need to try more flavors and get out of my comfort zone of just buying pistachio and chocolate.",

I really didn't like those flavors because they were either bland or way too artificial (raspberry).  Lemon and chocolate stood out because lemon was the perfect mix of tangy and sweet, and chocolate had the best ganache, wasn't too sweet (I'm a dark chocolate fan), and had a nice, velvety texture on the inside.    Chocolate chip cookie was just okay.  I prefer mine chewy, and this one was very crispy and dense.  BUT, the tomato/feta/pesto foccaccia was TO DIE FOR!  A thick, moist, and fluffy slice of foccaccia with a layer of pesto, tasty roma tomatoes, and feta cheese on top.  Such a yummy snack prior to eating at the Wynn buffet.  The BF and I didn't eat lunch so that we could eat more at the buffet, but we needed a little snack to quiet the growls!",

The next time I ordered a coffee with room and the short/thin young girl who works there was so rude to me when i asked a question and refused to give me an answer.  My friends who were standing behind me thought I was going to blow a fuse on her based on the attitude I received but I decided to keep my composure this time.  I witnessed the staff making numerous mistakes with peoples orders and I waited 10 minutes to get two Splendas for my coffee.  Considering how busy this place gets, there should be more people working there.  I also wish they had some sitting instead of having to walk to the food court to sit down.",

Gasp! All six in different colors - all for me!? I thought how was I going to fnish this, but I did. I ended up giving one away (not sure which one it was, hopefully not one that I would regret), but I kept the rest in a tightly sealed container in the fridge and I devoured them throughout the week.  Pink - My guess is that this was some kind of berry, maybe strawberry or raspberry, but it was yum.  Green - Pistachio. Great for nut lovers. I personally am not a big fan of pistachios in anything other than the nut itself, but the fact that I was eating a macaron, it didn't bother me.  Brown - Chocolate. I'm a huge chocolate fanatic, so this was orgasmically (if that even is a word) good.   Yellow - Lemon. Perfect for those who like their sweets a little tart.  Beige - Coffee. This was my all time favorite of the batch. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I do love the taste of coffee and the fact that I can't have any right now or the next four months I think made this one top it all.   But after eating the whole box, I think I had enough macarons for awhile. =)",

Loved the lemon, which was tart, light and refreshing.  The chocolate one was very rich - I had actually ordered raspberry but was given chocolate...didn't discover it until after we left.  Be sure to check your bags before you leave the counter!  Our goodies totaled up to $30 even - pricey, but a nice once-in-a-while splurge.  The bakery is hidden behind some escalators, in front of the Phantom Theatre.  No tables or seats, so either head to the food court or to the Coffee Bean on the second floor - not the one right above the bakery (tables are right in front of the counter), but the one around the corner and on the way to the self-parking lot.  You'll find 4 or 5 tables that are hidden away from the counter, so you can eat your goodies without feeling embarrassed about being a total squatter.",

The sandwiches were very reminiscent of those from Europe, with quality ingredients--great crusty bread, meats, and cheeses.  I was very pleased that though the sandwich had been sitting in the case for a bit, it wasn't soggy at all!  The real stars were the desserts.  The crust on the pecan tart was so thin and buttery and delicate that the honey and I are going back to the Bouchon Bakery in Yountville this weekend to relive the experience.  The bread pudding was also super delicious; it was the right balance of wet and dry, and was wonderfully flavored.  Amazing.    This is a must-visit little stand in Vegas.",

I've been to Bouchon Bakery before but I just happened to stop by because I stayed at Venetian back then and the guest elevator was right there.  I've ordered coffee and something else which I can't remember what.  They were good but didn't think anything was exceptional.    My sister was with me this time and she happened to like these kind of bakeries so we headed to try this oh so popular macarons.  They looked like one of those tasteless meringue desserts, I wasn't sold still.  I told the guy I've never had them so pick one flavor for me.  He said his favorites were coffee or pistachio so I got a coffee macaron and a madeleine.  I've bought a little bag of madeleines at Jean Philippe Patisserie before and they were very dry and awful.  I was very disappointed with them but Bouchon's madeleine was moist and good as it should be.    Finally I had a bite of macaron...  Oooohh Mmmmyyy Goooood, it was soooo gooooood!!!!!  My sister said there is this bakery shop near her work which sells macarons and they were so good, she always thought to bring some for me but they were so delicate, she never did.  She got chocolate and raspberry.  Chocolate one was good but I thought coffee was a bit better and the raspberry one was not too sweet not too tangy, simply delicious!  She said those macarons are even better than her favorite place.  They were probably one of the best thing I've eaten for a long time and I'm talking about a dessert.  Crazy good!   Before we left Vegas, we stopped there again and had some more for us on the road and few more for my pet sitter.  I've asked them to put a few in a box and they told me they have a box of each flavor (total of six) for price of five so I've got that.    Those macarons must have something in it like we call Pinkberry, \"Crackberry\"...  They are so addictive and now I want to drive 4 hours to Vegas just to get those macarons now!              Those macarons definitely deserve the 5 stars.",

It's a small to-go shop and they sell coffee, pastries, and sandwiches. They also sell macaroons in a decorative box ($16.99) - a perfect gift for the pet sitter, or for that co-worker covering for you while you're in Vegas.  There was virtually no line when we went there (twice), and the service was attentive.",

I thought it was a full on bakery but it's more like a side stand (like those Starbucks stands in the mall).  Anyway, all of their stuff looked great but I came to try the macaroons.  I'm not even a macaroon fan but I had to try.  I purchased two, the raspberry and one of the seasonal which was a blue earl grey.    I could do without the earl grey one, the flavor just didn't do it for me.  It was a weird combo of flavors.  Wasn't bad...but wasn't great.  The raspberry one though...so good!  The textures, crisp on the outside but soft inside.  Definitely became a macaroon fan!",

    "text": "Venetian is dangerous. I hardly walked pass the slot machines without stopping at the Chinese Queen machine because of the lights. I was on my way to the Phantom Theater to pick up my tickets for the night, and I passed by Bouchon Bakery. I was suckered into their macarons. They sell them individually and in a pack. I couldn't resist and I couldn't decide on which to get. My love told me I could get whichever one I wanted, while he orders a turkey cranberry sandwich.   So I ended up getting that pack. Yes, fat girls' problems, but it's worth it. They were of six different colors, There's a vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel flavored. I posted a picture of it, colors do get to me. They're not too sweet, which I liked. My favorite ones were the pistachio and the coffee ones. I find the jam inside the raspberry one to be a little too overwhelming. The size is enough to split with someone else, especially if you want a bit of everything at once.  Their sandwiches are pretty good too, especially for a quick lunch. The baguette bread was crunchy on the outside and quite soft in the insides. Too bad I devoured it too soon (I wanted to spend more time with my macarons). The bad part is that you have nowhere to sit and eat. It's like a grab and go cafe.",

But I already love everything about this place.   The coffee was delicious, including the lattes. The pastries all looked great. But the reason for coming here has to be the macarons.   Wow! They are huge, and reasonably priced (and they often have some special going on- for July, it's buy one get one free for the chocolate-covered macarons). The light, crisp outside and the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth filling- delicious. My favorite was the vanilla macaron, followed I think by the pistachio. The salted caramel and coffee macarons are worth your time as well. I'm not as much of a fan of the berry flavors as others tend to be, but my colleagues told me that the raspberry was fantastic. This may just be because there are not a lot of mind-blowing macarons nearby where I live, but I've been disappointed in every one I've had since trying these (and even the good ones are so small compared to Bouchon's monster macarons!)  Fellow Yelper Vivian H. gave me the tip that the downstairs Bouchon Bakery (enter the Venetian, go right down the escalator) typically has shorter lines than the upstairs one, and you can grab a seat by/on the pretty fountain to chow down. So True!   From now on this will be a must-visit each time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Generally speaking, I don't get cravings for sweets and desserts like how I do with  pho and ramen.  If I were to ever get the urge though, there's a pretty good chance it would be for a delicious, French macaron.  Well, other than ice cream of course.  Or a fresh, homemade chocolate chip cookie.  A thin one, with slightly crisp edges, a golden brown bottom, and a soft, chewy center with plenty of melted chocolate chips.  Yeaaaaahhhhh, that'd be good....wait, what was I talking about?  While most French bakeries offer up smaller, near bite-sized macarons, I love how Bouchon's are almost the size of your palm.  Even though that means you pay a little more for each cookie, it also means you have that much more to enjoy.  And enjoy you will, with a light, crisp exterior sandwiching a sweet and chewy filling.  Although I've yet to try the Pistacio flavor myself, I've heard plenty of good things about it from friends.  For me, my favorite has been their Espresso Macaron - loaded with a rich, coffee flavor, it won me over after just one bite.  Since this Bouchon Bakery is really more of an outlet/coffee stand in the Venetian (by the theater), the selection is smaller compared to what their actual \"bakery\" locations can offer.  However, it still tastes just as good, and that's what matters most, right?  After all, if you start to crave a macaron, it's better to be stuck choosing from just a few varieties than to not have any to choose from at all!",

    "text": "Based solely on their macarons and peanut butter cookie sandwich this bakery has the BIGGEST Macarons I've seen and also the most EXPENSIVE!  Nested inside the Venetian hotel hidden behind its theater, this bakery usually has a long line and by the time you get to the front everything is sold out! Their actual restaurant location is near the clock tower--but I'm not sure if they offer bakery items.   I ordered the salted caramel and chocolate macarons and would say they are comparable to Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento--just two times bigger and more expensive! Not sure what all the hype is surrounding this place? Yes, their macarons are soft and chewy--but what macaron isn't? Their peanut butter cookies with cream in between was OVERLY sweet and honestly tasted worse than an Oreo. Maybe I ordered the wrong flavors but either way there was nothing AMAZING about this bakery.   Overall, Bouchon is like the Chanel of macaron bakeries!  (Probably why they think it's Ok to overcharge everyone.)  While smaller, less famous, Dooney and Burke level bakeries, price their macarons at $1.75 MAX and taste exactly the same.   If you want something MOUTH WATERING visit the French Laundry in Yountville! Same owner but the food there is to die for!! Definitely worth the money versus these small desserts!",

No creative flavors available - just the classics of chocolate, caramel, coffee, vanilla, pistachio & raspberry.  The large cookie size meant that the ratio of shell to filling was way off (too much cookie) and my raspberry was a tad stale. Service was pretty crap too - the attendant couldn't have been more disinterested.  Honestly, it's my fault - who buys a French pastry in an Italian-themed casino? Lesson learned.",

    "text": "My favorite bakery. Even more than Jean Philippe. Bouchon is relatively cheap and gourmet. I got an iced mocha, better nutter cookie, TKO cookie, and one of the plain baguettes for about $17. That's cheap even if not on the strip. The cookies are huge.  Iced Mocha - rich with quality cocoa powder. The best mocha I've ever tasted. Has notes of coconut from the rich cocoa powder. Get it!   Macarons - best macarons IMO. They are big too. No hollow shell like some places. Perfectly soft with the nice macaron shell crust. Not chew like some places, although I'm not against the chewy type macarons. These macarons melt in your mouth.  Cupcakes - I saw a giant cupcake for $3.25. They are in between the jumbo muffin and regular sized muffin cups. I've never tried any of their cupcakes, but they look really good. $3.25 for a cupcake is a steal these days considering Sprinkles at the Linq charges somewhere around $4 I think.  Better Nutter cookie - GET IT. Even if you don't like peanut butter. This is like a peanut butter lover's dream come True. My mom isn't fond of peanut butter but she is absolutely obsessed with this. The cookie has bits of peanuts in it as well as peanut butter I believe, the cream filling is a peanut butter italian meringue buttercream. OMG, it's soooooo good.  TKO cookie - chocolate butter cookie with white chocolate ganache filling.  Meh, it was okay. I wish the filling had some vanilla flavor, but it was really just cocoa butter flavor and cream. I think vanilla would've helped the flavor shine a bit more. The cookie is also really soft. It was hard to break pieces off. But hey, that means you don't have to share. The chocolate cookie itself was good and not sweet. It balanced the sweetness of the filling nicely.  Bread - it's their standard baguette they serve at dinner in their restaurant. They toast it up for you if you want and ask you if you want jam or cream cheese. The bread does get hard after it cools down, so better eat it while it's warm. Nice crust and chewy. Great aroma.  Americano - the first place I've ordered an americano that tastes creamy without anything but espresso + water. I don't know how they managed to do that. If you need a dairy-free option, get the Americano.",

It is a decent selection and they do have specials, but they don't carry items like the chocolate covered macaroons. The larger macaroons also aren't as large as the macaroons I've had from Bouchon in Yountville (although the price is still the same).   They have a special where you can buy 5 macaroons and get 1 free. You can choose your flavors or they have some pre-packaged. The macaroons themselves, although not as big as I'm used to, are still really delicious...even a couple days after they're good!   Now that I know where this location is in Vegas (it's by the theater in the Venetian), I will definitely make sure to stop in for a treat. It wasn't busy at all either when we stopped in the afternoon on a weekday.",

I visited and purchased food from the Bouchon Bakery on the first floor of the Grand Canal Shoppes area. It's just off the Strip near B&B Burger and the outdoor gondola ride. We happened upon another Bouchon Bakery when we went upstairs afterward, and the original location is somewhere inside The Venetian. We found this one to be the most convenient, and it had a slightly wider selection than its overhead neighbor.  I took two items to go and ate them within a few hours. The Croissant ($3.75) is a go-to pastry, and the version here is golden brown outside and chewy outside, with enough buttery flavor for anyone but diehard butter fans. Aside from how easily some of the outer layer flakes off, it's comparable to any other versions in town both on-Strip and off-Strip.  The Kouign Amann ($4.50) is another classic, although it's tougher to find. It's both more difficult to make and less popular. This version does have a lot of the right crispy and chewy textures and the expected sugary flavors. I think this one cheats a little though; you can easily see a glassy sugar layer on the flat side of the kouign amann, and the dough just doesn't have enough layers. It's way too flat compared to other good versions that I've had. However, if I was blindfolded, I would likely have no issue.  As long as parking stays free at the Palazzo and the Venetian, I'd consider making regular stops to this Bouchon Bakery for some pastries. My first taste was good enough (let's say 3.75 stars averaged between the two bites), so I'm optimistic about similar results if I venture into the cookies, macarons, or other baked goods (cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, and so on).",

It is somewhat hard to find, but worth the effort.  The location mirrors the bakery shop located in Yountville serving a limited selection of French style pastries and coffee. There was no line when I visited which allowed me to get a blueberry Croissant and chocolate Macaron paired with an espresso with little effort.  The pastries were very good, although the blueberry Croissant was a regular one cut in half and filled with cream and fruit instead of baked in. The Macaron was very delicious with good flavor and texture. My espresso was done well and served in a tiny cup with a tiny plastic lid.  This is a great place to enjoy the famous Bouchon pastries without waiting at the actual restaurant. It is hard to find, but impossible to forget.",

    "text": "Bouchon Bakery is a classic tourist trap in the Venetian on the Vegas Strip. I came to Bouchon Bakery one other time a year or two ago and the experience was so forgettable that I don't remember what I ordered or ate.   This time, they won't be so lucky.  I ordered a ham and cheese croissant ($6.94) and requested it warm. Their version of \"warming up\" a croissant sandwich is apparently putting it in the microwave without actually turning the microwave on. Whatever treatment they gave it resulted in a \"smooshy\" and sad-looking croissant, but one with a decidedly cold filling. The ham was of the normal sliced deli variety. Despite being billed as containing dijon mustard, I couldn't taste any mustard. My eagerly-anticipated croissant ended up being nothing more than an unfortunate waste of emmenthaler cheese, and a waste of $7. I would have had a more satisfying croissant sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts.  I also ordered the kouign amann ($4.16), which was not as bad, but also no better than the kouign amanns I get at bakery-chain Paris Baguette in San Diego for half the price. Rather than being rich and buttery, with a cake-like consistency, Bouchon's kouign amann simply tastes and feels like a large croissant with a caramelized top (or bottom, depending on how you plate your kouign amanns).  My pastries were accompanied by an iced latte ($5.32) that was poorly conceived and negligently put together, with my syrup of choice fully sinking to the bottom of the cup before I could even take my first sip. Middling chains from Starbuck's to Panera Bread to Coffee Bean have solved for this by using thinner, more soluble syrups, why can't Bouchon Bakery?  Anyway.  Shame on you, Chef Keller. Understand that when you put your name on an establishment that serves food, your customers reasonably expect that establishment to represent your culinary ideals and perspective, regardless of whether or not you're directly overseeing the operation or engineering the menu. Your name has value, and people are willing to pay extra for that given your well-earned reputation. I have to believe that if one of your pastry chefs ever tried to serve anything of the quality I've had at Bouchon Bakery to your customers at French Laundry or Per Se, you'd fire him or her immediately for gross incompetence. Do the right thing and put this abomination of a bakery out of its misery -- your reputation is at stake.  Food/Decor/Service: 1.2/3.3/NA",

(Additionally, there is also a Bouchon *restaurant* here which is different from the Bouchon *bakery.* I see folks have erroneously posted photos here that are actually of the restaurant.)   This particular outlet is a small stand in a busy area right outside the elevators to the Venetian guest rooms and, if I remember correctly, underneath a bank of escalators. It has a compact but decent selection of cookies, macarons, pastries, baked goods, desserts, and sandwiches, plus it also serves espresso and coffee drinks. Things can sell out pretty quickly early in the day, but pretty much anything is good here, whether the macarons, nutter butter cookies, or espresso drinks that I tried.  Service is simple and straightforward; there's one person at a counter manning everything. Because this is located right outside the Venetian guest elevators, it's a perfect venue to grab a snack or a small breakfast to go.",

    "text": "It was Sunday night at 8:00 and it took me awhile to find the place. I was looking at the macaroons and this guy started to enclose the ropes on us. I decided to buy the macaroons, one of each, and was told that I get one for free if I get five.   OK, good.  Then the same guy that was surrounding the ropes on us started asking us loudly \"Is that all? Is that all?\" right after we ordered from this lady.  I thought they open til 9pm, I guess they wanted to close up.  OK, no problem. So, I whipped out my credit card in a hurry.  Guess what? The same guy that hates us wanted to see ID for $17.50. Now, I am annoyed. After all this, Mr. Hater asked me in a condescending tone while holding the receipt \"You want the receipt?\"  Anyway, the macaroons were great, delicious actually. But I will not go back again for the over priced macaroons and get run off again.",

I decided he too needed to smuggle baked goods in his luggage. I think he did a better job than me.  I only asked for bouchons, but I was also given a chocolate tart. I think my heart stopped for a couple seconds while eating it, and I'm not sure if it's because I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing by myself or because it tasted of chocolate heaven. Even though it had been in the freezer for a couple days, it was still pretty damn amazing.  The bouchons were just not that amazing in retrospect after the tart. They were good, but I can make a glorified brownie too if necessary. I am far too lazy for a tart.   I would eat everything again though, and then some more, don't get me wrong.",

After being mislead a few times and wandering around aimlessly on the casino floor, we finally found it. I guess it didn't help that I was smashed from my Fat Tuesday's drink, but that's another story...  The traditional croissant met all my expectations for everything I love about these buttery little bastards: flaky crust on the outside, soft and airy on the inside. Well done.  One bite of my friend's strawberry croissant and I was hooked. Incredibly moist, sweet without feeling like you'll develop a cavity. I also had a taste of the chocolate macaron, which was very rich and decadent. It felt so sinful!  So-so with the s'more cheesecake. The textures were off, in my opinion. The chocolate was chunky and hard, would've been much better smooth like the cream filling. The marshmallow was difficult to eat. And the butter in the graham cracker crust overpowered the other flavors.   The next day I returned and got some bread that resembled foccacia. It was so soft like a pillow.   The only awkward thing that happened was that I forgot my green tea at the barista counter. Realizing this 10 minutes later, I returned and it was still there. I wanted to make sure that it was mine, so I asked the workers. They just gave me blank stares.",

Although it's a little on the pricey side, I say 6 macarons for $17.50 is all worth it in my pocket.  There about 7 macaron flavors total, which include: pistachio, vanilla, coffee, lemon, raspberry, chocolate, and one I can't seem to remember.  All were my favorite except the chocolate and coffee.  The vanilla one is extraordinarily delicious!   I haven't tried anything else besides the macarons, but by the judge of it....it looks like everything they serve is definitely an A in my book. I've been hearing especially good reviews about their TKO.  It's kind of a hidden place, it's right behind the escalators from when you first enter the Venetian through the parking garage.  Stop by if you get the chance, believe me it's all worth it.",

Sadly, by the time we got there, they were all sold out. This was at 11am.  We opted for a TKO (their version of an oversized oreo), red velvet and chocolate cupcakes.   I really liked the TKO; the filing was really good. As for the cupcakes here, NO. The red velvet tasted nothing like red velvet and they put regular ol cream cheese in the middle of the cupcake. The chocolate one was okay.   I really want to know what the doughnuts taste like. Doughnut get the cupcakes.",

And The Cafe Bouchon on the 10th floor of the Palazzo..  seemed great place  to have a breakfast business meeting   being ( Neutral) as I call it.. A nice view of the outside patio.. See but don't touch.. ??? It was a GREAT morning.. Patio was closed.OKAYY.. While I was waiting for my client.. I ordered the tray of assorted pastry.. Looked tempting.. But thought rude to start nibbling .. My client  arrived after the usual greetings.. we were both famished..  A very friendly waitress brought us coffee..  perused  though the breakfast menu.. and decided I was in the mood for Classic Bacon /eggs breakfast.. My client decided on the same.. Coffee was good.. We both tasted the Whatever pastry it was supposed to be.. TALKING ABOUT LOOKS BEING DECEIVING! YUCK! it tasted like a rubber toy ! Okay, Maybe it was a mistake.. Let's go on to the next pastry on the well served eye appealing tray.. we cut in half  the almond  something..?!?? UHMM  Other than a few decorative almonds on top of the \"PASTRY\" There was no hint of Chantilly cream.. no almond .. Okay.. Let's move it along.. The pain Au chocolate  I suppose it was to be a classic chocolate croissant.. Was Empty, and dry.. Our eggs arrived.. A bit runny to say the least.. Hey but the coffee was good! We ate the toast and drank 3 cups of coffee .. BTW 2 eggs and a sliver of bacon.. 4 $ 22.00 each.. I wonder where the chickens came from?  The eggs weren't certainly golden.. ;) The tray of pastry 4 PCs were not for human consumption..  BUT THEY LOOKED GREAT!    If you want a breakfast that looks good.. And your not Hungry.. This is the place to go... ;)) . CIAOO",

Five stars for the pastries, but one star for the poor service.   Pastries: I tried the macaroons in salted caramel, coffee and pistachio and all were excellent. These are large, about 3x the size o a normal macaroon, and we're perfectly gooey in the center and crunchy on the outside. I also trie a croissant, which was flaky and light.  Service: poor, sloppy, rude. My latte came out too hot and I could taste the burnt milk (I used to be a barista so I know they steamed it way over 140 degrees). When I asked them to redo it, the guy rolled his eyes, didn't acknowledge me and handed it back to the barista. No apologies that my overly expensive $6 latte tasted shitty. Also, they got my macaroon order wrong and I didn't find out till I flew home.   Bouchon is a prestigious brand, and I'm surprised they'd hire bratty little teenagers or people with the service level of a McDonald's to represent their brand. No matter if it's the flagship restaurant or a little express location like this one, Bouchon should ensure consistency and quality in the experience of their brand.",

But, this is pretty much a gourmet ho ho and it is awesome! *  TKO - This one is like a gourmet Oreo.  In fact, I think the name stands for Thomas Keller Oreo. *  Vanilla eclair - Simply a pate choux pastry with vanilla custard and cream. *  Strawberry/Cream Cheese Croissant *  Nutter Butter  Other notes: -  Opens at 6am, which I guess is early for a Vegas crowd.  10 am would probably still be early, too! -  I'm not a big macaroon person, but they have a pretty good selection here.  They also have 2 different sizes. -  They run out of some pastries fairly early in the day, so if there's one particular thing that you like, make sure you go early. -  Coffee is good and the accoutrements are at the side (just in case you were looking for them).",

Most of the time I'm the first one awake so one of the mornings that I went across to the Venetian from TI to grab some coffee I found this place.   The pastries looked fantastic but I can't say how they were because I never sampled or tasted any.   The coffee was alright, and the staff was nice. The bakery itself is pretty tiny, at least the one that I visited was. There's really no room to sit so you just grab your order and take it outside or back to your hotel room. In the mornings there was a very smelly homeless man hanging out in the Venetian bridge/skywalk lobby right outside the bouchon. So if he's still there I definitely would recommend walking away with your order.",

Came home to broken macarons because of the hollow crispiness. Tears ensued. But a delicious macaron nonetheless!",

It was like honey and  crispy on the outside and super flaky on the inside. I think it's rare to stumble upo Kouign amann, for it's not widely made in most bakeries. The macaroon didnt look too pleasant.",

We went to their new location which is located by the Sports Book. I thought it was the one and only in Vegas but when we were getting ready to leave, we got a little lost looking for the elevator to the parking garage, and we stumbled upon the other location. When I got home I went online to their website and discovered that the location by the Sports Book opened in December.  I got a box of their delicious and addicting Macarons, a Nutter Butter, and a TKO. The Nutter Butter and TKO were good but not an \"oh my goodness\" good. I don't think I'll be getting them again. The Macarons were absolutely amazing. Now I know why they're so popular, and yes, I will be getting more on my next visit there.",

They were still tasty the next day.  5 stars because the service was fantastic. I actually got a deep paper cut on their stiff paper table cover. We asked for a bandaid, and I was provided with some Neosporin, and a small handful of bandaids. I also forgot my hat when we left, and had to run back to get it.

While we were huffing it from the Venetian over to the Fashion Show shopping center, I had the urge for one of their delightful almond croissants.  Now mind you, having been in Paris just a few weeks back, I know the difference between French and American inclinations, but the almond croissant was amazing. Flaky on the outside and moist and buttery, with sweet almond paste smeared heavily throughout.  It's not the same, compared to Paris, but a good enough diversion for the time being.  In addition to croissants and pain au chocolate, there were tarts, buns, macarons, Danishes, cookies, and lovely baguette sandwiches lined up in the display case paying homage to the native style snacks everywhere (simple sandwiches of ham+cheese, just cheese, etc) but make sure you get in early, because the croissants go quick.",

Lots of other runners had the same idea too because there was always a long line and that made me grumpy.  Fortunately, this is a well oiled machine, and the line moved quickly.  Coffee and croissants from this little bakery brought me back to life every morning.  The blueberry croissant was good, but nothing beats a traditional one.  I also lusted after the ham and cheese one but forced myself to pass on it so I would still have an appetite for brunch/lunch.  Their coffee is also very good.  I drink it straight and black, so no way to hide bad brew.

    "text": "This location in Las Vegas is not up to par to the one in NYC.  The 2 stars is for service and quality of the macaron and croissant.  First, it was obvious I was next in line and the counter girl took the guy behind me.  There were 3 other workers milling around; either inside the kitchen or doing inventory. None of them acknowledged me even with my irritated face. Finally one of the workers asked what I wanted.    The macaron was cold; meaning it was not fresh.  I also got the almond croissant; if I've known this before hand I would've never wasted my money.  Again, it was not fresh; it was dry and lacked almond cream filling. The vanilla macaron that I usually get at Bouchon's in Columbus Circle is so fresh, decadent and service is great!   If Thomas Keller knew about the quality of the products that they're serving here, he would be appalled!  Two wrongs will never make a right!  Service sucks and so do their products.  Shame on you!",

The dressing was very good and the pickled lettuce was a nice touch.  The croissant was just OK. A flaky croissant with a chocolate filling.

My favorite was the hazelnut/cream/(?) followed by the lemon and the espresso. I found the rasberry too tart and the orange too strong. They were delish AND I did share half of each macaron.  5 stars for delicious snacks and pretty, see-through packaging.",

Today, I see a charge of $13, which means that the Phillipina clerk rewarded herself a tip of $5.50. So, beware when paying, always have cash for small purchases, or you'll give greedy people direct access to your bank account. Five dollars isn't much, but if you overcharge all people who pay by card, then it adds to thousands of dollars. I used to live in Hawaii, and this was a common practice for clerks to supplement their income-fraudulently overcharge people.",

In the past couple years, on prior trips, I've also had their cinnamon rolls, sandwiches, cookies, treats - you name it.  If Bouchon Bakery sells it, it won't just be good - you can bet it will be great.  I'm giving Bouchon Bakery 4 stars rather than 5 stars because of the staff and because of the lack of seating.  The staff doesn't really display much of a sense of urgency, so the line doesn't move as quickly as it should, and there is nowhere nearby to sit down.  Still, fantastic place.  Highly recommend.",

The macarons are good but I wish they would make them half the size and half the price so I could eat more flavors. I like to try different flavors but I don't think I can eat more than one without getting sick.  Plus if you don't like a flavor (I didn't like the chocolate) then you feel guilty about throwing away a $4 macaron. I'm a dark chocolate lover, but the flavor just seemed way too intense for a macaron. I also tried...  Blueberry Financier - ehh, it's ok, but the plain almond one was way better. Too bad they don't have it right now.   Apple Croissant - Amazing, esp if you love apple crisp or Dutch apple pie. Make sure they toast it for you on the panini press.  Almond Chocolate Croissant. - It's pretty good, but the chocolate dominated the hell out of the marzipan, their regular almond croissant is better, but they don't have it there now.  Bouchons - INSANELY DELICIOUS. I always buy a package of 6 for $10 and take them home and bake them in my toaster oven for a couple minutes. They get kind of crisp on the outside and very soft and melty inside. They are very high in fat, so I put a wad of paper towel under when I bake them. It's always soaked with grease so I figure I can eat more because I am sparing myself a lot of fat grams, lol!  I'm dying to try their HoHo or choc tart next time  Oh and for the CUPCAKE lovers, get your Red Velvet Cupcake to go from the restaurant, for some reason it was waaaay better than the one in the bakery case.",

I was buying them for me and my sister and her friend so I decided not to get any crazy flavors they may not like.   I got a vanilla for myself, one coffee, and one chocolate.

I had more fun taking the picture than eating it I think. No, but they were good. The cookies had a crunch to them while still keeping an airy texture to them. The filling wasn't overly sweet and each had their own distinct flavor.   They weren't cheap, I think $3.50 ish for one but heyyy these are some seriously awesome macaroons for the macaroon enthusiasts so check em out. You won't be disappointed!   YELP 365: 175/365",

    "text": "\"CARROT CAKE WHOOPIE PIE!!!\"   That's right Michelle T, I'm stealing another one of your openings. Whatcha gonna do about it, punk?   This Bouchon Bakery is located at the Venetian Hotel, right underneath an escalator. In reality, this is not really a bakery but more of a small stand that sells Bouchon pastries. It's no bigger than a Starbucks you'd find inside a grocery store. Even though it's small they still have a good amount of baked goods. They have things like macarons, cookies, breads, sandwiches, pain au chocolat, muffins, bread pudding and more. They also sell coffees and other drinks. After our brunch at the Bouchon restaurant upstairs, my wife and I stopped by the bakery to get some goodies to go. Since we ate a big brunch, we only bought a few items. This is what we bought;  Carrot Cake Whoopie Pie <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=Q7FOhoMWrBUJ2KsUr3UDSA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_S...</a> Caramel Macaron <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=sj466FYKhGU57ud0VuAQzg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_S...</a> Nutter Butter Cookie Sandwich <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=6d6z_ZykwN8phHEamNR7bQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_S...</a>   All three treats were really good, especially the carrot cake whoopee pie, which was one of the best tasting carrot cake treats I've ever tried. The caramel macaron was not the best I've had but it was still really good. The same thing can be said about their nutter butter cookie sandwich.  The prices are good and the service is fast and friendly.  If you like Bouchon's baked goods, or if you're a Bouchon virgin, then this little stand is worth checking out.",

    "text": "So, imagine you're me: you think any meal after noon no longer has the right to call itself brunch, you've been known to get hangry (hungry+angry) even when well rested, hangover-free, and in your own time zone and consequently you ALWAYS pre-breakfast before meeting friends for brunch, and you're the only person in your group of friends on Eastern Standard Time. The \"Let's meet downstairs at 11am on a Saturday\" plan is not going to work for you. Enter Bouchon Bakery.  Open 6 am to 9 pm every day of the week, Bouchon Bakery presents the opportunity to grab a snack the night before, or offers you a destination in the morning when you are inevitably awake before everyone else. Craving something sweet? Go for the decadent sticky-bun. Want something a little more basic? An epi-baguette with butter and jam will stave off hunger until it's time for brunch. Flying Southwest (no meals) at an ungodly hour Sunday? Grab a ham and cheese croissant and laugh at the people eating the pathetic airport offerings.  Also good: the raspberry filled \"beignets\" (they're not beignets--they're regular donuts, but they are super delicious), the macarons (especially caramel), the almond toffee and the shortbread cookies (the latter two make a particularly nice present for your significant other that hates cheap crap like magnets and key chains).  As I'm sure others have mentioned, it's not cheap, but nothing is in Las Vegas. At least the expense doesn't come with a long wait. It's notable that it isn't anywhere near the Bouchon restaurant. You'll find the bakery on the first floor of the Venetian, under some escalators, which isn't very descriptive, I know, but just find someone in a security uniform and ask for directions. They are all really helpful.",

I didn't care for the pumpkin macaron, but the other 2 were soooo delicious. The latte was perfect and the ghost cookie was surprisingly yummy and not too sweet.

    "text": "Just call me crazy macaron lady.  I've been on the prowl for perfect macarons for a couple of years now. I've found a couple places that I love, a few that I like, and a ton that were just not good. I was delighted to find a small Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian when I was in Vegas last. I saw a ton of macarons and I knew I just had to try them.  MACARONS. Hmm... well, I've had better. Collectively, the macarons were just okay. Individually, some were better than others. I went to Bouchon thirty minutes before they closed and realized they didn't have many macarons left in the display. I asked if they had more in the back, and the girl working there said they do but they're in a set of six. I thought to myself, this was perfect! I wanted to try a bunch of flavors anyway. So I ended up paying around $20 for six macarons. Crazy right?! Usually I pay around $25 for a dozen. But hey, when in Vegas.  I noticed immediately after my first bite that the macarons that were pre boxed were not very fresh. I could tell because the macaron completely crumbled after one bite, which is usually because they've old. Fresh macarons (24-48 hours) are typically crisp on the outside but are chewy on the inside. Though the outside shell can be crumbly, the whole thing shouldn't just collapse. The macarons were either old or they weren't made properly. Regardless, I tried every flavor. My favorites were the chocolate, coffee and vanilla. The chocolate was filled with a rich chocolate ganache. The coffee was strong but in a good way, the way it should be in a macaron. The vanilla was light and it cleansed my palette after the strong (delicious) coffee macaron I had just before it. The strawberry tasted funky to me... kind of like a flower. I don't know how to describe it, but I didn't like it. I find strawberry macarons are a bit tricky to get right, not unless you use fresh strawberry in the filling. The artificial flavors just don't cut it with this delicate french pastry. The pistachio was horrid... it was strong in flavor and was just too much for me to finish. I'm not a fan of pistachio, so maybe that's why. But if you love pistachio, you'll probably really enjoy this one!  PRICE. About $20 for a box of 6 macarons is quite expensive. I realize this is Vegas and Bouchon Bakery is expensive, but dangggg! I think next time I'll come earlier in the day, make my own customized box of macarons, and call it a day. I'd be more satisfied with a box full of flavors I really like.  OVERALL. Okay macarons, in my opinion. The price is way too much for what you actually get. I'm no cheapskate, but I know how much an 'okay' macaron should cost, and how much a GREAT should macaron cost. I paid too much for 'okay' macarons.",

Though the size was bigger than other macarons I've seen it was DELICIOUS. Every single flavor was spot on. The macaron had the perfect chewiness and firm texture that I now look for in every other macaron I've tried since. I recently went back on a trip to vegas and nothing has changed. The macarons are still perfection in my mouth.  I've also had their tomato and mozzarella bread which was really good too! I gave some to two of my friends who instantly raved about its taste upon the first bite!  One caveat I have is that their pistachio flavored macarons have been inconsistent in taste from time to time, but still GOOD!  Because the bakery here is smaller in comparison to their bakery in New York, there is a smaller selection of items. Luckily I only come for the macarons.",

He had a chocolate pie and I had 3 macaroon. Visually the macaroons looked appealing and the size was generous compared to other offering on the strip. Taste was too sweet (a lemon macaroon is not supposed to be sweet) The chocolate pie was just like eating a chocolate bar. And the prices were outrageous (2 espresso drinks + 1 dessert and 3 macaroons for total of 26$!) I think there are better offering on the strip so look elsewhere.",

Too much fun to think of food and then, after five hours under the hot sun, walking on the Strip, my sister literally collapsed on the ground.  I walked fast (also hungry, couldn't run) to Bouchon and got a nice grilled cheese sandwich and orange juice. The juice was fresh and I am sure they didn't add any sugar. It was delicious. The grilled cheese was properly buttered and there must be an extra ingredient because that thing was the bomb - or maybe I thought so because I was starving. My sister recuperated quickly after drinking the juice :)",

    "text": "Had the best Banana Walnut Muffin that I've ever eaten.  Stuff is not cheap here, but it is well worth the price difference.  Not just that, but the staff there was nice and efficient.  I really wanted to give them a thumbs up for having the patience to deal with this crazy Chinese lady that held up the line for 20 minutes on 12/30.  She kept claiming that they overcharged her and demanded that they give her some cash back.  You might think, \"Okay, she really could have gotten screwed by some error,\" but then a few things happened that convinced me otherwise.  After the manager refused to give her whatever cash she wanted, she said something to the effect of, \"I know Thomas Keller, and this is not how he would want his business run.  I'm going to let him know how you people are treating me.\"  The manager eventually gave her some money just to move her along, and then she pulled the following... She took her bag of pastries (just 2), went off to the side, and when the workers weren't paying attention, she put the bag back down on the counter.  When the worker came back to the register, she yelled, \"Where are my pastries?!?\"  The worker responded, \"I just gave them to you.\"  The lady decided not to respond, and just reached over and grabbed the bag that she had JUST PUT DOWN.  I think she was trying to con her way into some extra freebies.  This whole scenario was quite ludicrous in person, and events like these are what make me skeptical of a lot of people's yelp reviews (customers aren't always right, and half the time are crazy).  Regardless, kudos to the Bouchon Bakery workers for keeping a level head and not flipping out after having to deal with this insane person.",

Because I can't really bring you with me when I leave. *sobs* and I was expecting I could sit and enjoy your atmosphere, and you're only a take-out counter!   Behind the escalator, in front of the Phantom Theatre, the baked goods were excellent. I made a beeline for the macarons, which were pretty good and not the usual one bite size, but at least 3-4 bite size. I warn you, if you decided to share... well better get your own, they sell sampler boxes of their six flavours for about $20, if you want to do that, so that may make an acceptable gift, if they are able to last the trip home.  Service fail happened, when we asked for a pain au chocolat and the guy serving us looked at us as if we had grown a second head, it's kinda funny, but shouldn't they have to know that pain au chocolat is chocolate croissant, since you have it every day on your shelves? I am not a fan of Mr. Keller's shortbread though... too much sugar on top of the cookie, but I did like his carrot cake cookie very much, I couldn't find the currents in the cake, but the walnuts were quite excellent.",

In terms of setting, the place is a cute little stand overflowing with all manner of sweet treats palatably displayed.  An energetic staff deals with a fair crowd in a friendly, efficient manner.  You can order hot drinks as well as pastries.  I tried a spiced hot chocolate, which was a bit thin and not quite irresistible, but tasty nonetheless.  The pastries were phenomenal.  I picked up a croissant, a cheese danish, and a TKO.  The croissant was flaky, endlessly layered, and rich with buttery flavor.  It was one of the best croissants I've ever tasted.  The cheese danish was easily the best cheese danish I've ever tasted, a luscious golden pastry perfect in every way, completed by a delectable cheese filling heightened with lemon.  The TKO was True to its humble Oreo roots yet elevated chocolate and white stuff to heavenly splendor with its moist cakey outsides and fluffy cream.  I also bought a couple boxes of macarons, one as a gift and one to eat as soon as possible.  The box came with six flavors - raspberry, lemon, vanilla, espresso, chocolate, and pistachio.  I was a little bit disappointed not to have a salted caramel, but it's hard to be sad in the face of good macarons.  Bouchon's were not the best I've had, but they were very good, with great yielding shells and light insides that delivered sugar without getting saccharine.  From what I understand, there are plans for a Bouchon Bakery in Los Angeles.  I almost hope I don't live near it, as I don't think I'll keep off weight with those pastries within a five mile radius.",

Like my fellow yelp friend, Emily C says. Most bakeries that sell macaroons are deceiving. They look great, lure you in, but when you take a bite. It's a little short of expectations and filled with disappointment. But not here!  Yes it is $3.25 a macaroon, but trust me it is well worth it!  1. The size of the macaroon is about three times the size of a typical macaroon. 2. The filling is to die for. Not too creamy, not too soft, but perfect that it just melts in your mouth and you can savor the taste. 3. The shell of the macaroon is perfect too! Hard enough to hold, but soft when you bite into it.   I'm ready to go and buy more!! You'll definitely see me around Bouchon when I'm in Vegas!",

With much hesitation he finally agreed.  This is going to be a short review but definitely to the point.  1. Chocolate Eclair: ugh.  Disgusting.  The chocolate filling was too bitter and it left that \"made yesterday\" taste.  Which it probably was.  2. Macaron:  I'm sorry, but macarons are not suppose to be more chewy than a stick of gum.  And it was chewy.  I lost faith in Bouchon's macarons here.  I thought they may blow LaDuree or even 'Lette macarons out of the water but they did not.  Even my husband (who's not big into sweets) even thought 'Lette macarons were good.  3. Carrot Cake Cookie: didn't taste bad, but I'd still settle for the Trader Joe's Karat cake.  Will I come back?  Most likely not.  I don't think it's worth it.  Thank goodness the restaurant is a whole other thing.",

    "text": "\"You had me at Thomas Keller!\" Every time I'm in Vegas, I always need to stop by Bouchon Bakery so I can bring some baked goods back home. Luckily, the Venetian Hotel has three locations for me to get my fill of delectable flaky morsels. With so much to choose from, you really can't go wrong with anything. On my recent trip, I got a box full of Beignets, Monkey Bread, Chocolate Almond Croissants, and Kouign Amanns. Everything was so delicious, but oh my goodness, the Monkey Bread was  phenomenal! I've never had anything like it. The sweetness of the bread was so perfect, I didn't mind how sticky it was. Pair it with a coffee and you have a nice little snack.   In addition to all the sweet baked goods, there's also a good mixture of savory items to choose from as well. The Ham and Cheese Croissant is usually a crowd favorite. However, I like the Turkey and Ham and Gruyere Baguette Sandwiches. They're perfect for a snack or quick lunch.  If you have limited space in your carry on, might I suggest bringing back a Macaron Gift Box. These are some of the best macarons I've ever had. Each box comes with 6 macarons. The quality put into each macaron is worth the price of the $14.50 box.   When it comes to the name Thomas Keller, you know it's of high quality. These little bakeries are no exceptions. If you're near the Venetian, definitely stop by one of these bakeries and grab a snack or a box of pastries. It's definitely worth it.",

My personal favorites are the macaroons and the classic croissant  but many people love the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo - tasted like a dry Oreo pie crust to me when I had it in NYC) and the other beautiful desserts.

It has an amazing crumble on the top that gives it a little crunch. The beignets have raspberry filling in them. They were good but not my favorite. I also had to try the hot chocolate. Unfortunately it was cold! Not something i would get again.",

I'm never really particularly hungry in the morning but this place seemed noteworthy enough for my friend and when we got there and saw how long the line that wrapped around the escalators was, we obvi had to blindly wait in line... for like 20 minutes... for a croissant.  Was it a particularly noteworthy croissant? No, but it was still pretty good and that was all I really could ask for at that point.",

There is an indoor ordering area and an outdoor window to place coffee / pastry orders.  The menu is for quick grab and go breakfast items.  You can eat on the patio with views of the strip or find a table inside. Prices are what is expected for Vegas, but the taste and quality of the goods is outstanding.  I have had the bacon, egg and cheese croissant several times and have always been impressed.  The croissant is one of the best I have ever had!  The eggs look strange as they are cooked in a sheet and then cut up...don't worry, they taste great! Coffee is pretty good too, but they were out of iced coffee on my last visit.  Not cool as it was 9am on a Sunday.  They also make some delicious macaroons.   This is an awesome way to have a great breakfast without the high Vegas brunch price tag.",

That said, I've seen much shorter lines and received quicker service on the second floor, and would suggest going to that one.",

I did not realize (or remember) there was one at the Venetian, but running into this magical heaven of bake goods was like finding water in the dessert.   TKO ( or thomas keller oreo) is my favorite cookie ever. I love oreos, but TKO is next level. I had one there and took some to bring back home. Even after a couple of days, they are deliciously good!  This time I also ventured into the macaroon world. Chocolate and Pistachio were tops, followed by salted caramel and vanilla. Next time I hope to try different flavors.   Bouchon is not cheap, but definitely one of the top bakeries in my opinion.   Happy (sweet) eating!",

The Macaroons are heavenly and a must try when visiting any Bouchon Bakery location. On this trip we tried the Mint Chocolate and Lemon Macaroons. The macaroons were flaky on the outside and soft on the inside with a nicely creamy filling.  And yes the mint was perfectly minty and the lemon was perfectly lemony and tart. We also tried the Better Nutter and TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo) cookies. These cookies take some of your favorite sweets and make them even more addictive. The Better Nutter was crunchy and filled with plentiful rich peanut butter cream filling. The TKO was basically a fancy Oreo with crisp and crunchy cookies filled with sweet cream. We also stopped by for breakfast and had the Pain au Chocolat and Cheese Danish. The Pain au Chocolat was nicely flakey and lightly filled with flavorful chocolate and the Cheese Danish was flakey and filled with a rich cream cheese filling (similar to cheesecake).",

My gf got the Chicken and Waffles with a Crown maple syrup and a sauce Chasseur ( brown sauce with mushroom and shallots)  $27.00.  We asked for the sauce on the side.  The chicken was marinaded for 24 hours. It was juicy but we found it a bit salty and tough. The waffles and Crown syrup were really good.   The service was fast. Our water and coffee were always filled. My biggest critique is that I spilled most of the sauce Chasseur on the table and the waiter who came by multiple times to fill our coffee and water never cleaned it up or asked if we wanted another sauce.  Quite disappointing for a high end place.   We also got two croissants. They were super delicious. Buttery and flaky.   We've been to the Bouchon in Napa and NYC and unfortunately, at least for breakfast, this Bouchon did not live up to the Thomas Keller standards.   Happy Eating!!",

    "text": "TLDR - good pastries but not something to seek out specifically  I was expecting more of an actual bakery/store but Bouchon Bakery is more like a small kiosk instead. There's 2 of them in the Venetian - one on the 2nd floor by an entrance to the shops and one on the 1st floor near the food court.   The selection of pastries is rather small. There's macarons, cookies, croissants and a few other sweets. Nothing fancy or particularly unique or special. Prices are pretty standard for a typical bakery.   Their cookies and pastries are good and a decent size, but not necessarily something I'd go out of my way to get again. Save your sweet tooth for other things in Vegas.   My friends and I got a few things to try here:  * CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIE ($3.25) - 4/5 Nothing too special but still good. There's definitely a lot of chocolate in it for any chocolate lovers out there  * OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE ($3.25) - 4/5 If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, theirs is worth a try. It has the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness. Just a slight crunch on the outside for some texture and chewy but not too soft on the inside  * BLUEBERRY CROISSANT ($3.75) - 5/5 My favorite of the pastries! Honestly it looked more like a danish than a croissant since it was pretty flat and had a \"filling\". It was basically a blueberry muffin in the center and croissant around it. Nice twist on a blueberry muffin! The muffin part was moist and the croissant part was light and airy.",

    "text": "Although slightly expensive, Bouchon has the best chocolate and chocolate almond croissants on the strip.  I have tried these croissants at many other places (Aria, Caesar's, etc.), and Bouchon has the best.  Crispy, airy croissants with a ton of filling.  It's not greasy and it's so delicate.  The macarons are delicious.  The blueberry croissants were interesting, but not as good.  Very tart and too much filling so it made it mushy.  The Kouign Amann is good too.  I was at the Palazzo at the Venetian, so I was lucky enough to stop by Bouchon every morning.  Delicious!",

    "text": "Best sticky bun I've ever had. The outer layers, which are typically dry, were light and flaky. The center was dense, moist, and loaded with chopped pecans. The entire bun was coated in a slightly hard, chewy glaze, reminiscent of pecan pie and topped with a mountain of pecans. $4 which in my opinion was quite a steal.   Pastel colored french macarons in flavors including raspberry, coffee, chocolate, and when I was there (1/10/13), a seasonal peppermint flavor. $3.50 a pop and cute as a button. I got a raspberry one that was airy and chewy on the inside, firm but light and slightly crunchy on the outside, sandwiching a thin layer of ganache. Delicious! The unique texture is really an experience you have to try for yourself. The individual ones are larger than your typical macaron, but they also sell boxes of little ones for around $18.   The long line that wraps around the display cases will give you time to drool and dream over the sweets that will soon be yours.   Yes, the prices are a little more than you might be used to, but for quality pastry....in Vegas, the prices aren't that bad. Just sit down, shut up, and eat.   2 locations inside the Venetian!",

Totally opposite from the Bouchon Bakery in Napa, where there is a ginormous amount of goodies to choose from.   I looked around and didn't feel like macaroons and yes they were BIG. I was eyeballing some cookies and didn't see any chocolate chip ones. I asked the gentleman behind the counter and he mentioned that the ones displayed were chocolate chip cookies. YAY!

First, we found the small location underneath the elevators, and they were closing and didn't have much left. They referred us to the location near the clock tower, and after stopping for directions twice and walking in circles for 30 minutes, we finally found it. They were also about to close, but they had enough goodies left to satisfy my needs.   I purchased a blueberry muffin (gone the next morning), a Better Nutter (I think that's what it's called - that one made it back to Colorado with me), an oatmeal cookie, and a chocolate chip cookie (also made it back to Colorado), and two Oh-Ohs (gone within minutes). It was all amazing. Now I'm fat, but it was well worth it. Now I have done the proper research to prepare me to make every single one of the recipes in the cookbook.",

I came here recently a little after they opened up. I got the carrot cake whoopie pie, the chocolate chunk cookie, and the banana nut muffin.  I enjoyed everything I ate, almost to a level of frustration for not knowing about this place sooner. The banana bread had so many nuts in it with a nice flavor of banana. The chocolate chunk cookie lived up to it's name sake with big pieces of chocolate in every bite, it was also really soft on the inside while having a crunchy outside, just how I like it. The best thing I ate was the whoopie pie. I am a big fan of carrot cake, and this whoopie pie hit all the notes of a great carrot cake. It was soft,  moist, right amount of nuts, a good spice cake, with a good amount of great tasting cream cheese frosting.  My only complaint was that while everything was still soft, it all had the same taste of \"not made today\". Nothing was full blown stale, but I could tell that everything I ate was from batches that was rotated to the front of the case. Next time I plan to come, I will see if I can get their baking and delivery schedule.  I will definitely be back to get the same stuff I got and try more of their selections. I will be adding this establishment to my dessert rotation, and I would recommend it to anyway.",

I also assumed the macarons would steal the show over the flashy less sophisticated sandwich cookies.    So wrong.  Days later and back in the Midwest I am gorging on the goodies and dreaming of Bouchon.  Such classy and excellent staff, so helpful and friendly.  Late hours at a bakery?  Phenomenal!   And that damn good cup of coffee.   Now. Macarons.  Some are small and crisp me skimpily slithered with succulent jam.  Others wear a brittle meringue hat and one may find the head within that hat a bit chewy and dense.  These varieties may be daubed generously with supple sensuous buttercream--never overly-sweet.    Bouchon has the latter sort.  I tried Black Forest, coffee, salted caramel, chocolate covered pistachio, and pumpkin.   All amazing, some more or less so.   I also destroy---er, I mean I ate a better nutter and a tko (aka Thomas Keller Oreo).  The two sandwich cookies were deliriously delicious.  Like a transcendental experience.   Full body bliss.  No joke.  Not too sweet.  Flavors were coaxed through due to the lack of molar cracking saccharinity).  Soft silky moist filled with shots of sensuously sweet butter cream.   So good I'm gonna spring for the cookbook and attempt to tame Mr Keller in my own kitchen.",

This bakery is hidden (at least in my eyes) because it is located behind and underneath the escalator at Venetian!  If I recall correctly, I saw pastries (croissants, danishes, muffins), sandwiches (ham and Swiss baguettes), cakes, cupcakes, cookies, eclairs, and what I came for: macaroons.  Macaroons sell at $3 a piece however, I must admit that they are huge and I should have opted that route however, being the fatty that I am, I bought a pack of mini macaroons for $13 (all flavors: coffee, chocolate, vanilla, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel).    The macaroons were light, fluffy, and smooth (the filling)... I can't describe it in words that can fully justify the macaroons but I reckon I will be back every time I am in Vegas simply because I work hard and workout hard so $13 for a pack of macaroons that I can devour entirely in less than 24 hours?  Hell to the yes.  I should have bought 2 for the plane ride home.",

NFL Sports bookings were going badly yesterday, and my buddies were going to need an emotional pick me up. Lo and behold, Bouchon was 20 feet away!  What I like about this place is that the treats are very affordable and not horrific Vegas prices. The strawberry and smores cupcakes were massive and comforted sorrows of a bad start for the NFL season. ($4) The chocolate chip cookies were chewy and delicious. ($3)   Macarons, like anywhere, are expensive. Some of them are bland and don't have flavors that shine (raspberry and pistachio), but some are perfect and deliciously rich, like chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. I highly recommend those three.

My husband loves the chocolate bouchons. The lemon meringue tart was ok... i think i prefer jean philippe patisserie in aria for pastries (croissant, brioche)",

The macarons were definitely way bigger than usual.   However, with that said, I thought the taste itself were just okay. I didn't think they were anything special, and a bit too sweet for me. I've had a cinnamon one, which I don't think any other place had this flavor before, so that was kind of cool. But still, not worth my $3.50 and deliberately coming here for a pastry!",

    "text": "There isn't a better latte to be found in Las Vegas.  Add in their delectable pastries (oh, how I love the macarons) and you've got a perfect afternoon pick-me-up.  They also have sandwiches, which also makes it a pretty good lunch option (especially if you're there on business and thus sprinting around trying to get somewhere on time).    On my last visit, they had a maple spice latte that I can't get out of my head.  It was nicely balanced, not too sweet, with just the right amount of maple.  Don't buy this if you like the pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks: you'll never be able to drink Starbucks again after experiencing what a great coffee can really taste like.  This can be a little bit hard to find.  It's tucked away in the Venetian, near the Phantom Theatre.  You can't see it until you're nearly on top of it.  But keep on walking until you find it, because it's totally worth the visit.",

You offer expensive baked goods but the macaron variety pack is well worth the trip to the Venetian.    I paid $17.50 for 6 macarons (lemon, orange, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla). My favorite was the lemon one - very refreshing. These macarons are huge - bigger than most macarons I've seen from other places. Unfortunately they didn't travel well. These are delicate cookies that almost didn't survive the heat and the flight. But I got them home and the edges were crumbly and the creamy filling had partially melted. But still, they tasted good. The case with the baked goods looked tempting - I would have gotten one of each if I had the space in my suitcase.",

Please do not give this chow house a cursory glance and walk on by. it's to great to pass up.  When you go.....  Quick lunch grab a sandwich, coffee and adesert or cookie...

We asked two Venetian employees where it was; one gave directions to the \"closest one\" and said there were three locations, the other said there was only one location and directed us to the one under the escalators by the Grand Lux. We arrived at that location 7 minutes before 9 (closing time) and the place was abandoned. We made it to the one facing the Strip about 3 minutes later just by chance and it was also closed. That location also opened late the next morning when we went back and I would have foregone the entire thing had I not wanted macarons so badly before my flight home. On the plus side, there was no line at all and I really liked the packaging of the 5-pack for the airplane.",

To my surprise, only Bouchon had the best deal, biggest macarons, and the cheapest price (when comparing sizes).. Jean Philippe sould be ashamed of themselves for even advertising the fact that the sell macarons. All they had was a puny 6 tiny macarons (size of a quarter) for $10.. Same thing with Payard. As much as they advertise they sell them- shame on them too. They didn't have any macarons except for puny little pre-packaged ones that were way overpriced..  All i can say, when it comes to getting real French Macarons in Vegas- the place to go to is Boucheron. Thank you Boucheron! I give you the highest credit for advertising what you really have in store (unlike others).",

We were surprised when we saw the coffee mug given to us. One of the coffee cup had disturbing Racist comments written over it.  We were shocked but did not wanted to argue with the servers. We went directly to the hotel concierge and the manager was called. They were shocked to read it too. The hotel security was called and a complaint was filed against the bakery staff.  We were told that the matter would be investigated and someone from the bakery will contact us within 24 hours. We were there for 4 days and never ever heard back anything. Our whole vacation was spoiled because of this disturbing experience. After about 3 weeks when I called the bakery manager she admitted that she was aware of the situation and started making stories that it was the customer's fault. When I told her that I was the customer, she completely flipped and said ,\"oh let me investigate and call you back.\" Since then I have never ever heard anything from them.  The WORST customer service I have ever seen in my life !!!!!",

Bouchon Bakery is one I've been wanting to try, so I made a point to stop by to see what it's all about. They had a great selection of pastries, cookies, breads, and other delicacies, but not so much that you feel overwhelmed when it's time to walk to the counter to order. Everything looked beautifully made! I literally wanted to try everything. I would have if my stomach had the capacity to do so.  I decided to get a selection of macarons to try. I tried the chocolate, lemon, and coffee. The chocolate was by far my favorite. The macarons were perfectly made. They had a nice crunchy exterior, soft interior, and creamy filling. Imagine a brownie as a cookie with a fudge filling...that's pretty much what the chocolate macarons were like here. Something else that caught my eye were these huge oreo looking things (Thomas Keller's version of the oreo). I ended up trying a mini one at dinner at Bouchon that night, and I wish I had gotten one at the bakery! That thing was crazy. It was seriously an surprisingly delicious, fresh tasting oreo. Despite all the hype, Bouchon Bakery satisfied my expectations. Now I'm tempted to go up to Yountville just for more Bouchon yumminess.",

They have 6 different flavors, pistashio, almond, vanilla, chocoloate, lemon, strawberry.  Goes great with coffee in the AM or a light pick my up snack in the afternoon.  This place does get crowded, but the lines go really quick with attentive staff.  They do have 2 or 3 kinds of sandwiches, but, why would you eat a sandwich at a bakery...?  They also have a Bouchon restaurant, (I didn't get to try)",

The macarons were DELISH... especially the lemon. As fellow yelpers had mentioned, the macarons sell out quickly, so the earlier you get there the better. There were a few flavors left to try- the chocolate was good, but the lemon was HEAVEN.  I will, however, comment that I wasn't thrilled with the service. I asked the lady helping me what some of the most popular flavors were... and instead of answering- she replied \"I don't like them at all. The texture is gross\"- GEE, thanks.  I am returning to vegas this weekend... I plan to try more baked goods at bouchon bakery... and hit up Bouchon restaurant as well... yum.",

I had their coffee and raspberry macarons (multiple, actually), and they were both pretty good. I think the coffee one had been sitting there for too long because it was kind of a weird sticky consistency instead of the light fluffiness that a macaron is supposed to be. One of my friends had the vanilla macaron and that was good too.   I also had their ham and cheese on a baguette toasted and that was delicious as well.",

My favorite was the coffee flavor (which I usually don't like in macarons but this one was excellent)!!  But I still think Euro Pane's salted caramel macaron is #1! I have yet to find one that beats that! although Chantilly comes close.  But this is a very close tie for 2nd! Get it get it get it!",

My dream is French Laundry but Bouchon Bakery will do for now! LOL.  My goal was to get my hands on their famous macarons. And yes, they were worth the trip and yes they were massive! At $3.50 per macaron or $17.50 for a box of 6 which included raspberry, caramel, vanilla, coffee, pistachio and chocolate. You can also buy 5 macarons of your choice and get 1 for free which obviously works out to the same price of $17.50 but you get to chose the flavours. Yeah, kinda pricey but macarons are hard to find in my city and a good maracon is even harder to find. I am use to smaller macarons, the Bouchon ones can be the size of a small palm. They are quite delicious - light and crisp exterior but full of flavour inside. My favourite is the pistachio but they're all great so get the box set.  The madeleine ($1 each) were quite yummy too. But I was disappointed with the croissant ($3.75), it wasn't as buttery as I wanted but very flakey. A surprise yum here was the mocha! OMG, their mocha is absolutely amazing - smooth espresso taste with a not too sweet, not too bitter chocolate. It was $4.75 for a small mocha and it was worth every penny!  The bakery is in the Venetian, right by the Phantom of the Opera theatre, just around the corner from the Grand Luxe Cafe and under a set of escalators. There's no seating dedicated to the bakery so it's basically a pick up and go place.",

It was the same scenario, barely a selection.   The macaroons are OK. We got the Salted Caramel, Vanilla and Chocolate. One of them was really stale and hard to bite in unfortunately. The texture is on point, but sadly the taste just isn't there. They all tasted very similar, with not munch of difference in flavor.   We also got the Chocolate and Vanilla eclair-(Pastry and what seems like just whipped cream in the middle). Also again very disappointing. I by no means a food snob. But I felt for the price and size, I was really missing out.   The staff was friendly, however we were over charged by $10. There were quite a few people and they were busy. We didn't have a receipt (our mistake). So we just made a note to never come back.   Real downer, but if I were you. I would spend my time and money elsewhere.",

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so I figured I'd start my day properly with a visit to Bouchon Bakery.  I didn't feel like blowing my funds on a full sit-down brunch, so the bakery downstairs was the next best thing.  Not to say that the bakery is cheap (omfg, Porto's in LA...) but it's a more thrifty alternative.   We picked up a tomato/feta focaccia (which the server offered to warm up for us) and banana walnut muffin.  Both were delicious.  The muffin was moist and not too sweet; the focaccia was savory and tasty. Nothing fancy, but the quality was more or less there.  One day, I think I'll actually venture up into the restaurant... but for my first Vegas trip, the bakery would suffice. :)  If you're passing through the Venetian, go ahead and pick up a snack while you browse the interesting and eclectic assortment of goods that you probably can't afford.",

Everything was HEAVENLY.   The Raspberry Macaron was by far, my favorite of the 6, followed by the Pumpkin and Chocolate. Like all Macaron lovers, I'm pretty picky about them (I'm a fan of the ones from 'lette) and these had the perfect \"chew\", flavor and shell :) Next was the TKO....and yup, it was a winner! Seriously, every bite was sinfully good. It was ten times better than a real Oreo (yes, it's possible!)   I've been on the hunt for the perfect chocolate chip cookie and Bouchon helped me get one step closer to finding it! It was wonderfully chewy and full of rich, quality chocolate...soooooo good!  This is definitely going to be a Vegas staple for me in the future. I will be dreaming about TKO's and their Raspberry Macarons till then mmmmm....",

    "text": "I stayed in the Venetian and this kiosk was right by my elevator bank. I got breakfast here a few days: pain au choclat one day, an \"epi loaf\" (mini baguette) with butter and preserves another day. Both were incredible. The pain au chocolat was super flaky and had a very respectable amount of chocolate inside. The epi loaf was just plain good bread, but the preserves were unexpectedly delicious: blackberry jam, just bursting with flavor.  I picked up the large box of macarons on my way home, which comes with a flavor assortment (raspberry, pistachio, salted caramel, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate). Laduree is still my favorite (airier, more delicate) but these were pretty darn good. I'm not sure they were as fresh as they could have been, they had a date sticker on them that was two days old. I think that may have been when they were baked? I was in a rush so I didn't notice until I was in the cab. Regardless, they were pretty great macarons.  Look for this place near the Grand Lux cafe in the Venetian (confusingly, there's also a Grand Lux cafe in the Palazzo). Don't be discouraged if there's a line, it moves fast!",

Since we couldn't all afford the real deal, we stopped by the bakery which is right across from the Phantom of the Opera Theater. It was around breakfast time so I got a croissant and the carrot cake cookie. The croissant was so soft and buttery. I liked the carrot cake cookie too but it's a lot of sugar. I couldn't finish it all in one sitting so I saved some for later. I thought I would be back to get some macaroons - they are the hugest I've ever seen - but I never made it back so that's something to get next time.  *Update* Finally tried the vanilla and raspberry macaroons. Delicious! Soft with lots of filling and full of flavor. These are bigger than those bite sized macaroons they serve at a lot of other places but about the same price at $3.",

Yeah...no. Maybe it was just the weekend I was there, but I swear the staff was friendly, everything was cleaner, and the pastries were fresher at this one (I may or may not have gone to all three, and I wasn't even staying at the Venetian).   We stopped here on our way out of town, and grabbed a couple of sandwiches and a bag full of pastries to last the entire car ride back to LA.  Turkey sandwich: Definitely have them heat it up for you. The French baguette is crusty and delicious, the cheese is nice and melty...perfect! Smoked salmon sandwich: Perfectly smoked salmon, piled generously on a Kaiser roll, with sweet pickled onions and watercress. Oh Oh: Keller's take on a Ho. Unbelievable. Perfectly soft chocolate sponge cake rolled with whipped cream, dipped in chocolate ganache that isn't too hard or too sweet, with a sprinkling of chocolate crisps on top. Our Oh Oh had four chocolate crips. When my husband handed my the Oh Oh to take a bite, it was upside down, and I unintentionally consumed all four of the crisps he had been eating around to save. Oops. Better Nutter: Two crisp peanut butter cookies filled with peanut butter mousse. Slight sweet, perfectly salty, incredibly delicious.  Kouign Amann: Flaky, buttery, not too sweet. Something you don't see too often. Definitely try it!",

My group shared the turkey sandwich,  chocolate croissant,  and koign aman.  Sandwich was average. Something that you could find anywhere . You can get it toasted though. The chocolate almond croissant was pretty good with a chocolate filling and crisp layers of pastry. The koign aman was new for me. We wanted to try something different but were extremely disappointed.  It was a chewy sugary eggy bread that had a hint of salt. Nothing interesting or revolutionary.  Wish I had gotten the pain aux rasin instead.  For the price, go to somewhere much nicer and tastier.",

    "text": "Went here on a pilgrimage with my niece because we both love croissants, pastry and good stuff, and we couldn't wait.  Well, we did wait until late in the afternoon, which may have been our first mistake. The little (and I emphasize little) shop was clean and welcoming, and the clerk was also pleasant. Selection was not great, but it is a satellite location and it was later in the day. There was still enough to choose from, but nothing tasted very fresh. The almond croissant was absolutely gorgeous but dry and hard to chew.  I cannot judge the macarons because, not unlike sushi, I realize they're popular but I have no idea why. You can have my share of those and the pork belly, too. The peanut butter sandwich cookie was good, but had too much overly sweet filling (this coming from a glutton), and the TKO (oreo) she got was rich and chocolaty but a disappointment with it's hardened filling that should have been creamy.  Not sure where or when these were actually baked, but I made both of these cookies at Christmas from the Thomas Keller cookbook, and, god strike me dead, the ones I made tasted better. Could it just be the freshness factor? In the interest of full disclosure, Rosebud HAD visited the Yountville location in recent memory, so her expectations were high, but I was only expecting for the professionals to do it better than me, and was still disappointed. In addition, there are little tables out in the foyer to sit and enjoy your pastries, but there was no enjoyment when a couple of drunks stumbled up, sprayed a giant tourist drink on the wall, and to our dismay started to settle in. Fortunately, a pleasant little man who was welcoming all passers-by into the hotel struck up a conversation and led them quietly away to parts unknown. Hope it was down to the basement for an old school butt kickin'. Anyway, I was planning to try the leftovers later and give them a second chance, but I wandered out into the kitchen to discover the anaconda with a gallon jug of milk in one hand and the empty wrappers in the other. He thought they were great.",

    "text": "I have to say, I love Bouchon in Napa Valley, that is actually where I first tried or heard of Bouchon, but this bakery in Vegas is AWFUL! Seriously, I have NEVER been treated more rudely or disrespectfully at ANY establishment.  This was such a big disappointment for me because I am crazy about Bouchon in Napa. Anytime I'm up there I will wake up early, drive way out of my way...anything to get some Bouchon treats!  I'm such a huge fan.  When I found out they had a location in Vegas I dragged my boyfriend and a few friends out to find it.  When we got to the bakery I was a little disappointed because it was a small stand with a smaller selection, not a full store, but still so excited to pick out some tasty treats and get one of Bouchon's amazing sandwiches.  I stood at the glass cabinet like a kid on Christmas and picked out 5-7 of my favorite pastries and then a sandwich and a latte for my boyfriend and I to share.  They asked if I wanted it toasted and I said yes.  I paid and then stood at the counter waiting for our drink and the toasted sandwich. The drink came fairly quickly.  But then we waited...and waited...and waited...and no one was paying attention to us.  It was like that section of the counter was invisible. There wasn't that much of a line so after a lengthy wait I walked around to the front of the counter again and asked about the status of the sandwich. She handed me one that was wrapped sitting on the counter and I noticed it was not warm, but thought maybe it had cooled off from sitting for so long.  We found some seats in the mall and I took a bite..COLD all the way through. This had not been toasted at all.  I LOVE these sandwiches warm so I went back and stood in line AGAIN like I was going to order something (only way to get someone's attention) and when I got to the counter asked the woman if she would mind toasting it because it did not feel toasted at all.  She took the sandwich from me and put it on the counter, looked at me, and then fished through some receipts on the counter and said \"You didn't pay for this.\" ??!! I paid you, I bought all this stuff I'm holding! \"No, you didn't pay for the sandwich, only the other stuff.\"  Apparently she forgot to ring up the sandwich and was now acting like I stole it. Really? I'm just trying to get a sandwich and some pastries, she made a mistake, and now I'm a criminal.  Outrageous.  I didn't notice that she forgot to ring it up because I purchased so many small items that my bill added up to $40-$50 and it seemed like the right amount!! She didn't even apologize for her mistake, I would have paid the extra, but she acted like I was trying to rob them so I just threw my hands up and walked away with the pastries I purchased to find lunch somewhere else.  This is why I will never go back to THIS LOCATION.  I was treated like a criminal, service was incredibly slow, and the staff was just plain rude.  There are plenty of other amazing places to get pastries in Vegas where you will actually be treated with respect.",

Macarons: fresh, soft, filled with flavor! Larger than typical macarons. Quality and freshness wise...best I've had so far!  Flavors: It changes from season to season. but they have their general flavors and usually a seasonal featured flavor.  What I've tried: - Mint Chocolate Chip: delish! It was like eating a puffy andes mint! Mint and chocolate was balanced perfectly. Had to special order these puppies though, because they were out of season. - Vanilla: simple and creamy - Pistachio: great taste and flavorful - Pumpkin: seasonal, but surprisingly GREAT!!! - Coffee: not bad  Location: Located in Venetian Casino hotel, under and behind the escalators by the Grand Luxe Restaurant  If price isn't a factor, then I would highly recommend!",

Unfortunately, a few friends and I showed up here around one in the afternoon only to find out they sold out earlier in the morning. Laaaaaaaame. So, since we were there we might as well try something, right?   Clarisse C. and Jeffrey L. purchased a red velvet cupcake, a chocolate cupcake with custard in the middle, and a TKO. The red velvet cupcake wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Jeff was really disappointed with it too. The chocolate cupcake wasn't much better, but a slight redemption from the red velvet.   Among four of us, we all enjoyed the TKO, which was basically a fancy Oreo cookie. If I could suggest any delicacy, I'd say grab yourself a couple of those.   Unitl I get around to trying the donuts, this review remains at 2-stars. That is all.",

They were so good, I kept on getting those two same things here:  1) Turkey and cheese baquette (toasted optional).  Comes on a walnut baquette with flavorful swiss cheese, turkey, and a sweet mustard-like spread.  I ate 4 of these, one for every day I was there.  2) Macarons.  So sad I discovered these late, as I was always focused on #1 above.  They have choices such as lemon, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla.  I got the vanilla.   **pause**   Melt. In. Your. Mouth. So. Delicously. Amazing. Macaron.    Where have you been all my life?   I've always thought the term \"macaron\" were reserved only for those coconut dropball cookies, but I learned from Eunice K. that this term also applied for this hamburger-shapped cookie sandwich filled with vanilla cream and coated with a light crunchy meringue-like coat.  If you are in for a quick breakfast or lunch, Bouchon has quality pastries, sandwiches, coffee and tea for that to-go meal you need.  Two big thumbs up from me.  **Just a note, it's a stand around the corner from Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian.  Nothing fancy.  Just a stand that serves delicious bakery items.  Eat your baked goods fresh, that's when they taste the best***",

Once I learned they had shop in Vegas, I knew I had to stop in there during my last visit to Sin City.    Before checking out of the Palazzo, I headed over to the Venetian to order some goodies from Bouchon Bakery.  The line was wrapping around their little bakery station in the corner of the casino.  I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order just by looking at their display of goodies behind the glass cases.  Finally, I decided on the following:  a turkey and brie sandwich, a carrot cake cookie, a cheese danish, chocolate croissant and a small coffee.  Yes, all of where were for just myself!  I'm a glutton =)  My boyfriend had already left and took an earlier flight home so I was able to spoil myself with these yummy treats.  Everything was deeeeelish!  I would definitely be returning for more sugary carby heaven.",

In the evening we stopped by to try the macarons because of the Yelp comments.  These things are melt-in-your-mouth wonders!  We had the chocolate which I highly recommend.  We also tried the small bites which look like brownies...also very good.  We liked our muffin/croissants so much the first morning we did the same on our last day there.

Had the cheese danish, croissant, yogurt parfait, an almond brioche, a strawberry croissant, and a raspberry macaron.  Everything was delicious.  Bouchon macarons are probably the best I've had in the US.  The service was a little on the snotty side, but I've actually found that to be the case at the other two Bouchon Bakery locations too.

The inside texture was really soft and slightly fluffy, while the outside had an ever-so-slight frosting \"crunch\" to it.  It was sweet, but without being too rich, and the chocolate was flavorful, but without being too bitter.  I'm going to spend the rest of my life wondering if this is the best cookie I will ever have.",

Favorites were the chocolate eclairs and the ham and brie sandwich. The bf really enjoyed the bread pudding - it was still moist and had a yummy crunchy texture outside.

I heard about this place from my friend Aileen A., who raved about its sister in Yountville, CA. I decided to eat something sweet after a nice big Lemon Chicken Piccata from the Grand Lux Cafe at Palazzo.   My friends and I chose the fruit tart ($6.50), the chocolate eclair, the pain au chocolat, and the chocolate cupcake. The eclair was alright...it definitely wasn't as good as the eclairs at Chocolate Swan. The cupcake was a bit too rich, but had a nice chocolate mousse filling. The best one was the fruit tart with its vast array of fruits like cherries, melon, cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes, blueberries, raspberries, etc. The pineapple on it tasted like a wet rag, but everything else on it was delicious! I just love tart crust! YUM!  I took the pain au chocolat home with me, and decided to eat it for a late night snack. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Just enough dark chocolate with the perfect flakiness of the bread! Loved it!  I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who wants nice bakery goods. I can't wait to try Bouchon in Santa Barbara this weekend!  WARNING: You can easily spend $10-20 here off of the delicious looking baked goods!",

    "text": "Yummy.    We were staying at the Venetian and this bakery just happens to be at the base of the elevators on the way from our rooms to the casino floor.  To me, that's like sending a fat kid to a candy store and telling her to go at it.  I love croissants.  I love good coffee.  If I could marry them, I would.   Being from Portland and somewhat of a coffee snob , I was really impressed with my foamy and rich latte on the first day...I had to ask who supplies their beans.  Bouchon Bakery had a really good espresso blend that is custom blended by Illy for them.  Their lattes really hit the spot in a city where it seems alcohol is consumed in larger quantities than water.  I couldn't wait to get up and hit this bakery almost every morning during our stay here.  Once I was even asked by the cashier if I worked at the hotel because she had been seeing me around a lot.   Their selection was all so drool-inducing but could easily leave a large gaping hole in your pocket.  Not to worry, the sticker shock will leave you momentarily in a daze until you realize yes, you are on vacation and YES...it is WORTH IT.  Their buttery, flaky croissants are excellent with jam on the side. Not to mention their red velvet cupcakes that were really moist and topped with soft sweet delicious frosting.  They definitely have all the red velvet cupcakes sold in my hometown BEAT.  These things are so popular they do sell out, so be sure to make your way here early enough in the day.  My only regret is not going more often and trying out the macaroons but I am sure I will be back on my next trip to sin city.  Do you ship??? :)",

I got a discount since i work at the casino. I bought a ton of brownies and macaroons and things i can't describe. Anyway, me and a coworker were having fun and we got the order which came to 22$ which, is what i expected.  My only complaint is i got home, overly excited about dessert that i nearly skipped dinner and went straight for one of my fave things in the world, Brownies only to be let down! :( it tasted like it was burnt, but nonetheless i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another... and another it all was horriblee :( luckily the other items i bought made up for it. I'm a fan of great service so i would definetly come back, but i'm staying away from those brownies!",

    "text": "Ironic that I'm giving Bouchon BAKERY such high marks, considering I am NOT a fan of Bouchon restaurant (eaten there twice and not impressed nor satisfied both times).  I have yet to try the MUCH reviewed macarons here. However, this is what I have tried:  1. Strawberry croissant...AWESOME. Fresh made strawberry jam inside a buttery, flaky croissant that's dusted with confectioner's sugar.. Not TOO sweet IMO and OH SO enjoyable.  2. Chocoloate Bouchon...Imagine the best brownie you ever ate, but more moist and less dense; then add some semi sweet chocolate chips in the middle, dust it off with some confectioner's sugar and you have a chocolate Bouchon. They clearly used a very high quality dark chocolate, could be a Valrhona 60%+ dark baking chocolate. Who knows? But I do know that I will be buying more of these bit sized treats.  3. Almond Brioche...The edges have a slightly stale and burnt taste to them. While some may prefer this texture and flavor combination, I did not. After discarding the edges, I was left with an amazing piece of soft and moist brioche bread with a wonderful almond paste and sliced almonds. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  4. Pretzel sticks...Personally, I love pretzels and pretzel bread. So while this was nothing special, I still enjoyed it quite a bit. If I could take it home and heat it up in the oven and dip it in some great mustard or cheese dip...then it would be GREAT!  There are still many things I plan to try soon, will update this as I try them.",

    "text": "Espresso macaroon was FANTASTIC. Ooey gooey espresso cream filling with a chewy light glazed meringue outside. Oustanding, 5 stars based on the macaroon. If I were to guess the best would be the espresso or the vanilla macaroon, the texture and sweetness of the filling would taste pretty off if it were raspberry or lemon, but it could just be my taste.  Bread pudding was good but not as mind blowing. I don't know why I got it, I mean I knew it wasn't going to be hot or come with any liquor based sauce but I bit. I wouldn't say it was a mistake other than I should have just ordered more cookies and possibly a croissant. Raisins and apples, bread was adequately chewy and sweet but it was just missing some pizazz.  I was sad Bouchon itself was closed when I went, the bakery was a consolation.",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas and wanted to try some French pastry. Found this on Yelp. I'm less than impressed. I ordered an epi bread mini baguette, 6 macaroons in 6 flavors and a TKO cookie. The Epi bread was hard as a rock. I threw it away after 1 bite. Plus, fresh bread tastes best hot, not room temp. Next I tried the TKO. Supposedly white ganache inside a chocolate cookie crust. I love ganache so I couldn't wait to try it. Meh. It tasted like an oreo but 10 times more expensive. At least I ate that. Then I had 2 macaroons.  Very gelatinous in texture. Not like a typical macaroon, which I knew from looking at it, but just not very good at all. I'll give them to my friend so at least they won't go to waste but I'm not eating anymore. Not worth it at all.",

The vanilla is very light and you can see vanilla bean specks in it.  The only complaint I have is with the staff. When asking about the macaron flavors, I was told that I had the choice between vanilla, lemon, raspberry, and chocolate. I chose vanilla and chocolate, after the girl helping me told me that the vanilla she picked up was a different color because it was prepared today and the others were not.  Great, I thought. Ends up the macaron was a different color, however, because it was lemon. It was still good, but do everyone a favor and ask your fellow workers before you start making things up.  ====  Rubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again",

The best of what I sampled was the chocolate croissant: it had two ribbons of chocolate in it, which was quite nice.  However, the pastry was just a bit too tough when it should have been tender, and it was too greasy.  I also took tastes of four different macaron flavors: chocolate, vanilla, raspberry and lemon.  The chocolate was far and away the best of the four, but it was more like a brownie than a macaron.  The weakest were the raspberry and lemon, which had too much oozy filling.  Worst of what I tried: the pain au raisin.  Pain au raisin is supposed to be a custard raisin roll, not a raisin danish.  Flat, extremely greasy... I will only grudgingly acknowledge that there were enough raisins and that they were soft and tender, but that couldn't salvage the thing.   I don't know, maybe I'm holding this place to unfairly high standards, but I know that pastry can be better.",

Also available for little French-ie sandwiches that look alright, but kind of boring and expensive.   This is a hidden spot underneath some escalators outside the Phantom theater.

I suppose I'm spoiled after visiting the Napa location so many times, but hey, Vegas is full of extravagance so I was a little disappointed as I was looking for treats to take home. Even so, everything we picked was well-received and enjoyed :)",

    "text": "Once I saw  \"By Thomas Keller\" I knew that I had to try this bakery! The Bouchon Bakery is somewhat hidden from public view. It's located next to The Phantom of the Opera Theater, next to The Grand Lux Cafe, inside The Venetian.   The day I decided to try the Bouchon Bakery it was the morning I was in search of a good latte and pastry/cookie. When I went down the elevators from my hotel room, I spotted this little spot packed and busy. I came closer and saw what all the buzz was about. Delicious looking pastries, breads, desserts, and more delicacies! I figured it was a go! I really did not want to spend more than $6 like I did the night before on a small cappuccino at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf that was mediocre.  WOW! Everything looked so amazingly fresh! I really wanted to try their foccacia that had feta, onion, and oven dried tomatoes and their chocolate croissant or their sensational looking fruit tarts or Bavarian Creams that had the golden chocolate transfer patterns...but I had to resist! I was going to have lunch with friends and so I decided to buy a vanilla soy latte and a cranberry biscotti. That combo was a winner! The latte was not too sweet and it went very well with the sweetness of the biscotti.  The next morning, before I left Vegas, I figured that I had to buy some macaroons! I purchased the chocolate and raspberry macaroons and they were very good. Their macaroons had the texture of a cross between a cake and a cookie but it fit it will! They were soft, chewy and the flavor swirled in my palate and it was not too sweet! The filling inside of them was just right and they did not look sloppy. Excellent! $3.50 each....little pricey but it's Vegas!  You can also purchase their coffee beans!  Customer services is very friendly!",

    "text": "When I went to Vegas, I knew I had to find a place that had macarons. Because that's what you do in Vegas?? Just kidding. I had a short list of places I wanted to check out and someone suggested Bouchon Bakery. Apparently this seemed like an impossible journey as my friends literally trekked all over The Venetian trying to find this place. Finally, after probably an hour of walking, we found Bouchon Bakery. Casino level, tucked behind the escalators.  When we finally found BB, I was disappointed to find how small the bakery was (like a stand in the mall food court), but boy did the macarons not disappoint! I bought the sample pack + 1 pistachio because I'm obsessed with this flavor. My oh my! This was so delicious! It was just like a macaron should be - delicate and crisp on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. I was in heaven and I spent the next 2 days eating the rest of the macarons (shared with my travel mates of course, I'm not that much of a fatty!). They are rather large, so they are definitely good for sharing if you get a few.  This is definitely a must if you love macarons!",

I used to work in a restaurant that made these delicate cookies as petit fours. I've been addicted ever since.   Bouchon Bakery is in the Venetian right underneath the escalator (if coming from self parking) next to the Apothecary. They close early sometimes depending on how busy they are. The 1st time I tried to go here they were shutting down at 10pm to my dismay.  The macaroons here are HUGE and the price tag is $3.59 a piece. I got the seven pack for (I'm embarrassed to say) $17.29 and a cappuchino to boot. My mama opted for their chai tea and the apple fritter croissant with almond creme. That croissant was delish and even though I'm not a huge croissant fan (after you've made them once its hard to eat that much butter knowingly) I snuck a bite or two of this.   I haven't made it all the way through my box yet but so far the chocolate has been the best. The texture of the macaroons is right on point! But the macaroons will only last (at the most) a week after you buy them if you keep them in the refrigerator the entire time (warns the staff). I really wish they labeled the flavors in the box :(.",

It was a must on the way out, on our way home from Vegas.

I got the variety pack - I've completedly devoured the strawberry one, and parts of the chocolate and pistachio so far.  OH MY GOODNESS!  So good.

Located on the first floor of the Venetian, it was a lot smaller than I'd imagined. It's not even an actual store, but rather a stand with only one display case. I got a raspberry macaron, a red velvet cupcake, and a carrot cake cookie to go. I was going to say that maybe they didn't taste as good as if I'd eaten them right away (had the cookie later that night, and the other 2 the next day) but all of them were sitting either in the display case, chilled, or out on top of the display case. I like my desserts warm and fresh from the oven, and none of these were that. All of the items were just fine, but I know they could've been better. I enjoyed the flavor of the macaron, and the cream cheese frosting on the cupcake was really cream cheesey, which isn't always the case. There was even frosting inside of the cake, so if you like frosting, you'd love this. The carrot cake cookie was probably the least impressive of the 3, but it's a nice, simple dessert if you're not too into the sweet stuff.  Overall, decent desserts, but don't come with high expectations.",

But man, it was so worth the search.  We were strapped on time so I quickly ordered what was recommended on Yelp... the macaroons.  Holy hell, I am not a huge pastry/sweets fan but this was amazing.  My two favorites were the spiced pumpkin as well as the vanilla.  But were bomb.  Pistachio was good as well.  The strawberry was disappointing -- but it may have just been lost in the glory of the pumpkin!  I'll definitely be returning.  Six macaroons for $17 is pretty hefty, but so worth it.

Yes, fish not prime rib from the buffet but fish.  Now imagine a fishy taste lingering in your mouth.  I don't care if you nearly climax when eating sashimi, if you eat that much fish, there will definitely be a specific taste lingering there.  We both had to get rid of this and the soda we had in the car didn't do it.    Bellagio was too far and Serendipity 3 had an hour long wait so we just decided to be lazy and eat here. BOY am I glad.  The sweetness of the macaroons complimented the fish aftertaste perfectly.  The bottle of Moscato d'Asti we with the desserts had helped of course.  Read Cherie T's review about the Macaroon.  My personal favorite of the two we got was the coffee.  The orange was still good though.  I ended up getting a pecan pie.  ($6) It was good texture on the crust nice and firm and crunchy.  The filling wasn't too sweet and the saltiness of the pecans made it just right.    Next time I'm at the palazzo, I will be going here and purchasing a tube of all the macaroons because I have a feeling they're all good.",

    "text": "I am a fan of Thomas Keller. And I also have a thing for French Macarons! Enter Buchon Bakery of Las Vegas, NV.  Located in the casino level of the Venetian (under the escalators). You can find this one-stop shop infamous for their coffee, cakes and other carb-a-licious sweet goodies!  What did I try? - BOUCHON = the French term \"bouchon,\" in English means \"cork stopper\" or \"cork in the mouth of a wine bottle\". In this case their \"bouchon\" was in the shape of a cork but in a cupcake form since it was a mini-brownie! This was VERY delightful! (emphasis on the VERY) In fact, the bouchon was soft and moist, chocolate-y, yet not over-powering. There was a touch of powdered sugar and for ($2) for one of these, you better savor the scrumptiousness! It was very heavenly!  - FRENCH MACARONS = I bought the to-go set (for $17.50), which includes all 6 flavors of their French macarons. They have chocolate, espresso, pistachio, strawberry, lemon and vanilla. ESPRESSO was my favorite out of all of them!  - CROISSANT = simple, buttery, flaky and couldn't stop myself from eating this! Caution for some of those buttery flakes falling upon your self! Word of advice: don't leave the evidence laying around!  - BREAD PUDDING = was very delightful! Filled with some custard, cinnamon, raisins and apples, this dish was very well put together! If you left me alone with this, it can be quite dangerous! I'm glad I shared!  - VEGGIE BREAD = made with fresh tomatoes and greens. It also had olives, pinenuts and delicious cheese! It tastes even better when TOASTED! (FYI = if toasted, expect to wait 3-4 minutes for it to be complete). But overall, even though I'm not vegetarian, I'd opt for this again!  Overall thought? Awesome with a capital \"A\"!!! I was a carb-fix so I did not sample the coffee. But there were lines of people who were ordering the stuff! Service was quick and it was nice that they were able to toast the veggie bread! The next time I visit here I'll be sampling the cup of joe with an espresso-flavored French macaron! Until next time my sweet, carb-a-licious bakery, I am forever a fan!",

The selection is pretty small, but decent for the shop's size.

Really, macarons just make you feel like you should be living like royalty a la Marie Antoinette without the head-getting-chopped-off part. GASP.

The texture of the Bouchon macarons are amazing: crisp outer shell with a chew/fudgy center, and the cream inside always compliments the taste of the shell.  So good!  These are melt in your mouth goodies!  My favorite flavors are the vanilla, pistachio, and my all time favorite; COFFEE!  Best french macarons ever made on earth!  Mmmm, makes me want one now!  $3.50 a pop baby!  But so worth it!  You will come crawling back for more!  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (54/365).",

We are not quite sure why they aren't keeping up with quality control, but after going out of our way to get pastries there on our one day in Vegas, we felt obligated to write a review.   We had butter croissants and almond croissants, and they were all stale and awful. They seemed to be day old at least. We have not only been to Bouchon Bakery many times in California, but we have also eaten at Bouchon Bistro in Yountville for various special occasions. We have never been disappointed there, and have always loved our meals. Perhaps the Bouchon Bakery in Vegas is under different ownership?",

Located at the casino level of the Venetian, this little coffee place offers up a small variety of pastries and sandwiches and of course coffee. So instead of going to Bouchon for breakfast (it's hella expensive), just have breakfast at Bouchon Bakery and call it a morning.",

The macarons are large in size for $3.50 and didn't have an eye popping flavor or bite to it. I prefer Paulette's up in SF. The cupcake was in cool temp that the cake was stiff and the frosting sucked. Something unique with it was the inside filling of cream cheese. It compared to whole foods cupcake lol.  Bottom line, this place is over rated I feel. This is nothing toooo special. I won't be coming back.",

A little on the pricey side, but the Turkey Baguette sandwich with a chocolate eclair has got me hooked.   I dunno what the hell is in that turkey baguette, so addicting.. They have it prepared in a glass window and once you order it they put it in a panini press-like machine to heat it up. The baguette has some leafy greens, lots of fresh turkey, a creamy/nutty/buttery cheese that is to die for, and a special spreAd that brings everything together. Also, the baguette itself is soft & crunchy with nuts baked in. Like Bobby Flay said, the best foods are the simple ones done right.   Pricey for sure but the Turkey baguette ($9)  is heartier than it looks!",

I guess that means they're pretty good.  So, I tried one of their chocolate chip cookies -- huge, about the size of 4 normal sized cookies. The flavor was good, not intensely sweet, but I've had better. It could have used larger chunks of chocolate.  I also tried the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). Loved it! Although is was bordering on being too sugary and sweet, the chocolate cookies were soft and chewy (but not too dense) and the creme was fabulous.

Those strawberry croissants that everyone was raving about. I was imagining fresh macerated strawberries, perhaps with a touch of cream, inside a buttery, flakey, chewy croissant. What did I get? Something like the love child of a fruit pie with crumble top and a danish. Yes, it's a croissant. Sort of. It's very buttery, but very flat. There aren't that many strawberries in it. And the flavor is dominated by the crumble topping (butter, sugar, cinnamon). It was not bad, it was just, eh, whatever. Definitely not worth getting up early to buy before they sell out. And definitely not worth getting more than once, if at all. I would say save your money for the macarons.   Oh, I almost forgot--there's some kind of round cheese danish type sweet that's AMAZING. I ate it at the restaurant, but if they have it at the bakery, you will not be disappointed. Get that instead.  Location:   Inside the Venetian. It's a little difficult to find if you are on the strip coming from the direction of the Wynn. Once you get to the Venetian you'll see the entrance to the casino (to the right will be the gondolas). Just go through the doors. Once in the casino, you'll see the sports book area to your right. Go straight through past the slots, table games and more slots towards the theater (currently showing the Phantom of the Opera). You know you're close when you see some restaurants to the right and an information desk in front of you. Bouchon Bakery is behind the information desk on the other side in a stand that faces the theater.",

    "text": "Visited: May 28th, 2011  Saturday was our shopping day, so we most definitely pounded the pavement for a good few hours. After Payard, we did some browsing, and some of the ladies went shopping. A few hours later, my friend Izzy and I were separated from the group when we were heading towards the Venetian. The reason for that was some dude pulled us aside trying to offer us wrist bands to get into clubs, and all he asked for was a tip. Since we didn't live in Las Vegas, we weren't sure if this dude was legitimate, so we walked away from it. We were trying to look for the rest of the girls, but then decided that we should meet near the canal shops where the gondolas were passing (instead of Bouchon Bakery).   So Izzy was leading the way over to the bakery. After walking a good 5 minutes from the entrance, we arrived. Bouchon Bakery can be easily passed by because it is under an escalator, across from the Bouchon restaurant. I came to the bakery solely because of the macarons, which Izzy said were pretty good. So I bought one of each flavor and there were seven of them. They were $3.50 each and totaled to $24.50. The price of those bad boys were steep, but I forked over the money just so I could taste them. I ate the chocolate one and the cinnamon one, and they were both delicious. I shared the rest of the macarons with the rest of the girls when we met up at the canal shops, and they thoroughly enjoyed them. One of the girls, Nicole, felt bad that I spent that much on the macarons that she didn't want to eat anymore. I insisted that everyone have the rest because these macarons are sweet, and I already had my intake of sugar for the day. Because of the macarons, it prompted a few of the girls to buy some as well from the bakery.   Overall, the service at the bakery was excellent, and the macarons were delicious. I popped my macaron cherry. lol..... But the cost of them I wasn't so fond of. I know there has to be a few patisseries in San Diego that make macarons!",

I prefer their macarons over those purchased from Jean Phillippe and the Sugar Factory, although while they are more expensive, these macarons are way bigger and taste better. And in the 6-pack, each macaron costs less than $3 a piece, so it isn't so bad in the end. I will go back for macarons if I'm ever in Vegas again.",

Luckily it survived and was still as divine as ever.  The unique characteristic of this red velvet cupcake is the extra cream cheese filling they put inside...like a jelly donut.  Cleaver...if i wanted a cupcake w/ my cream cheese...Regardless of the overload, the cake part was soft and perfectly moist.  Well worth the $3.50 each.    A great introduction to Mr. Keller's empire...  French Laundry- I will meet you too some day.",

They don't serve the ham and cheese croissants after breakfast time! Boo...lame. Although sad, I couldn't leave empty handed. I decided to get the raisin croissant and some raspberry-filled beignets.

The carrot cake, I had hopes for you, but they were quickly dashed when it tasted dayold.  I thought it was pretty pricey for average tasting baked goods, especially for all the raves.

I make it a point to stop by here at least once when I'm in Vegas & my only complaint is that some of the counter people can be very holier-than-thou. Ironically, the ones working @the NY Bouchon Bakery are pretty nice & friendlier than the ones @the Vegas Bouchon Bakery. Which is pretty ironic considering the Vegas counter people work at a lower-level version of this place which is really just a small counter in front of a theater, with no place to sit to enjoy the food & coffee.  But still ... the macarons always draw me back here. Cannot say no to all that almond-ey goodness :-).  Note: Do not shove bagged macaron into your shoulder bag & eat in hotel room. I made the mistake of doing that once & had to eat the flattened contents by licking them off the bag they put it in :-b. Not my finest moment!",

The only thing that saved me from pulling my hair out was the delight of munching on my pastries I brought home from Bouchon Bakery!!!  I had the Financier and Pain Au Raisin for a total of $5.25.  Trust me, this is a very fair price to pay for heaven in your mouth!  First, I devoured the Financier, which is like a Madeleine but better!  It's encrusted with sugared, sliced almonds, which gives it the perfect crunch while the cake itself was perfect in every way: both in texture and taste!  I wikipedia-ed financiers and supposedly, \"financier\" is \"derived from the traditional rectangular mold, resembling a bar of gold\".  And boy, this truly is a bar of gold.  At this point, I was going to give Bouchon Bakery 4 stars.  Then........then I finished my Pain Au Raisin for breakfast.  Can my taste buds be any more spoiled?!?  I thought being a day old would depress the quality of this croissant-like pastry but noooo.  The raisins aren't pruny; you can actually taste the meat of the raisin..and the sugar crystals instantly dissolve in your mouth!    I admit, I was skeptical at first..but now, I'm a believer!  I can't believe I didn't try Bouchon Bakery the last time I stayed at the Venetian, considering it's the first thing you see once you leave the Venetian Guest Towers!  I'm definitely coming back to try everything else they have to offer!",

It looks like a figure 8, like 2 cinnamon rolls stuck together. Not too sweet, and again, crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. Its one of thier more popular pastries, and I had to get it since it was the last one left. Macarons were to DIE for. They are bigger and thinner than your average size. I didn't think they looked very special but after I got one taste. I literally said \"wow\". The girl behind the registered laughed at me. All thier baked goods are around $4 dollars. More than your average price, but definately worth it!  Thier baguette sandwiches are also really good. They are a bit pricey.. but whats new in Vegas? :) ~$11 for a sandwich. 3 different kinds: the roast beef, ham/cheese, and turkey. I got the turkey. The bread have these huge walnuts. The spread has a garlic kick to it. And the cheese was very flavorful. The bread was very dense and crunchy. You can get a toasted, and the sandwich turns kind of into a panini. Ive had it both ways, and loved it :)  I would go back to vegas, just to get bouchons :)",

The texture is perfect as well as the outer shell is light and crunchy, the inside is soft and chewy with a beautiful chocolate center.  I always get macaroons whenever I see them and this place has the best.  Further, these are almost twice as big as regular macaroons.  Always, ALWAYS get a box of 6 because you get 1 free as it helps to alleviate the price a little even though macaroons are pricey everywhere (even for small ones).  I've also gotten the 3 pack of chocolate chip cookies and they were great also...good chocolate flavor and a nice texture.  The first time we tried the macaroons, we tried almost all the flavors...the other flavors were OK, but I can't recall any single flavor standing out except chocolate.  Every subsequent trip to Bouchon has consisted of only the chocolate macaroons.  The ironic part is that there is a Bouchon in Beverly Hills but we never go when we are there, it's almost as if it's a Vegas tradition for us.  In a city where desserts at buffets are rampant and way too sweet, these chocolate macaroons are the best treat around.",

Having had Bouchon macarons before, I thought it would be worth it to drive to the Venetian hotel, park and walk through the casino for this tasty little treat.  I had a friend in town on a short layover and had told her how these were the best tasting macarons I had ever had, including our many trips to Paris.  Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE. At $3.50 per cookie, I expected them to be super fresh and melting in my mouth. They were not moist, but completely dry and old tasting. Two stars because the chai latte was decent.",

I bought 2 chocolate croissants and 2 cheese danishes.    My husband thought the chocolate croissants at the M resort (Babycakes) were better, but admittedly I liked these better from Bouchon.  But as I'm not really a huge sugar eater and spend more time tasting and buying for my husband, his opinion counts more than mine!  The cheese danishes were odd, but not in a bad way.  It was almost like they were baked like the croissants, and flaky in the same way.   I personally liked these better than the croissants.  If I'm at the Venetian again, since I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, I'll try the macaroons.",

The chocolate is only right in the middle, which I guess works but if you love chocolate like me you want some more!   Grilled cheese (4 stars): Crunchy bread and good cheese.

So often yogurt parfaits seem like the smart choice but end up not being very good. Not the case at Bouchon. This is exactly what you want your yogurt parfait to be. They separate the granola so it doesn't get soggy and the yogurt tastes great. Good luck trying to resist all the sweets in the display case.",

Their selection is limited unlike their other bakery in Napa. However I make good use of their daily selection of macarons, croissants and pastries. The macarons are huge but their selection is limited with just the basic flavors. When you do have a chance to go to Napa, pls stop by their bakery there. I love their seasonal flavors and my favorite was the Cherry Cheesecake macaron and Monkey Bread.  The male barista during my visit was a bit overwhelmed. I ordered chai tea to go and he made me 3, lol. Then he had to deal with the British couple after me, who were angry at him for not allowing them to pay through their hotel bill. WTF?  Poor guy.   Anywho, their croissants are pretty good and I always order a box to go for my grandma. It can get pretty pricey as these are artisanal baked goods and hand crafted pastries....and of course it's Thomas Keller.",

Nearby was a small Bouchon Bakery which I had never heard of.  My son informed me it was pretty well known as the best bakery in the country so we decided we had to try something.  A chocolate croissant and coffee was the choice to enjoy sitting by the canal and enjoying the views, you could easily imagine yourself in Venice.  The pastry was wonderful, I can see how the reputation was earned.  I noticed a cookbook on display and ordered it when I got home.  The Bouchon Bakery cookbook is a masterpiece of baking photography, recipes and documentation of historical French baking techniques.  You can look at it and just drool for hours.  The cookbook is a little unweldy in size but lures you into thoughts you could actually create something this good yourself, if you were willing to do as much work and devote the time to make some of these classic baking creations.",

On my one day stay, I was so excited to wake up in the morning to indulge on flakey croissants and Earl Grey tea for breakfast. I could not help but purchase 4 orders of apple croissants, 2 almond croissants, a kouign-amann for the road. Out of these orders our favourites were the apple croissants; a delicious almond filled croissant with soft baked apple layer on top.   Although I noticed an array of vast macarons, I was not keen to try as their flavours were nothing but the ordinary. For macaron consumers, these sizable cookies would be an indelible treat.

Apparently there was some mix up about that because reviews for both businesses frequently show up on one another's pages, and now Yelp HQ has handled this by closing the old bakery page and opening a new one.    \\_()_/    I'm somewhat surprised this business still has the Bouchon name on it- the quality is nowhere near what you receive at the bistro, despite a few shared items, nor is the quality. The TKO (Keller's version of the Oreo) is a fantastic sugarbomb, and the macarons are larger than most other places have them, but stick to the seasonal flavors and go earlier in the day. Cookie sandwiches here MUST be split between at least two people, they're large and delicious but probably pack over a day's worth of calories. As for their delicious epi bread? It's better when accompanied by a delicious dinner at the full restaurant. The chocolate bouchons are also better had there.  The service here is notoriously awful. I don't know if they're going for a detached snobby French aesthetic, but every cashier I've ever had the displeasure of working with here has had an attitude and a scowl. It's a simple job and it's in the service industry, how hard is it to make your face NOT look like you are on Death Row? The fact that the receipts here automatically print out a tip line is hysterical, I've received better service from an ATM.",

Their huge slider-sized macarons caught my eye when I first walked past and I knew immediately I had to come give them a try. Oh, and these babies? The Queen bees of macarons as their gargantuan bodies stood out amongst the vast array of smaller, more delicate confectioneries and other irresistible French baked goods on display.   I purchased their Pistachio, Vanilla and Chocolate macarons and, not surprisingly, Pistachio was my favorite - I've been completely smitten ever since!   Quite possibly the best Pistachio macarons I've ever had. The cookie shell was perfectly crisp, yet easily giving way to the pillowy soft goodness within as you take bite after delicate bite - sigh, Heaven. The prices were great too at $3.50/each.   I also tried their croissant which wasn't bad as it was buttery and flaky. Honestly though, I just wish Thomas Keller can open a Bouchon Bakery closer to where I live as I now have a new, potentially lifelong, obsession with their Queen-sized macarons!",

It was extremely difficult for me to decide on what I wanted because I wanted everything!!!  I got:   The Ham and Cheese Croissant, Blueberry Muffin, Kouign Aman, regular croissant, Pistachio Macaron, Chocolate Chunk Cookie and a Cheese Danish. Oh and a Iced Caramel Macchiato.  The Ham and Cheese Croissant was stellar. Rich, Salty, Unctuous and Meaty. Best ham and cheese anything I've ever had. This comes heated if you like.   Other stand outs were the Chocolate Chunk Cookie, one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Chewy, Crispy and not too sweet. The Carmel Macchiato was phenomenal too, they use something a like a rich caramel cream... It was to die for!   The other items were pretty good but I've had better macarons. They were very good though.   Great place to grab a little bite or a treat for any type of meal. Besides for having an amazing pasty case they also have all types of savories like sandwiches and salad, they even have a chicken wrap! I will be coming back here as often as I can, that Caramel Macchiato is worth coming back for alone and it's not even a pastry!",

Later for dessert at home, I heated up the Chocolate Almond Croissant and it was flaky and tasted good. I'd like to try the Apple Croissant next.

We have been to the location in Beverly Hills but this was my first time here at the Vegas location.  My wife and I both ordered the Petite breakfast which comes with a pastry, coffee and juice, eggs, and bacon and sausage and a side of fries.  The food was good and obviously this place is know for its pastries.  We did have an issue with the service.  Halfway through our meal we noticed that we were not served our juice.  When we asked one of the wait staff, we were told that it did not come with our meal, which we were a little confused because the waiter took down our order.  It wasn't until we got our check that we asked another person and he clarified that it was indeed included so they brought us a glass after we have already finished our meal.  Also our fries never came and by the time someone came by to see if everything was ok, it was already too late so we told them to cancel it.  Needless to say we felt like the waiter just totally ignored us when it wasn't even that busy since we were seated at like 8am on a sunday morning.",

This location is inside the Venetian hotel and it is kind of hidden nearby the restrooms and behind the escalators inside the casino.  I've had Bouchon Bakery at Yountville, in Beverly Hills, and at this location a number of times so I can compare the quality and taste a bit. For some reason though, the pastries in Yountville still is the best to me. I'm not sure if it has to do with the environment and the setting, but that's just how I feel.  They always have a splendid deal of: Buy 5, get 1 free Macarons. I especially like their salted caramel, coffee, and pistachio flavors. However, their other flavors do not disappoint either. Their macarons are one of my favorites and cannot be beat - the inside is nice and creamy while the outside has a nice crunch without all the flakiness. I also have had their cookies and pastries and have not been disappointed yet. However, they aren't particularly amazing.. just all in all good.",

I visited here after hopping off a red-eye flight from Hawaii.  I was exhausted, famished, and yearning for that luxurious little treat.  Enter: beyond-deliicous onion/bacon Danish pastry.  Flaky puff pastry formed into the cutest pinwheel, stuffed with the perfect proportions of ricotta/cream cheese, and topped with bacon and caramelized onions.  Oh.  Em.  Geee.  Seemingly popular for their macarons, I picked up a couple: pistachio and raspberry.  The flavors were slight and a bit too sweet for my taste but were easily the largest macarons I've ever seen!  A great novelty snack or gift.  With small bites and a gorgeous setting, Bouchon Bakery would be an excellent addition to a personal Las Vegas Strip food tour!",

Also the latte is on the lighter side, would suggest to go with an extra shot if you like your latte richer.

    "text": "Thomas Keller has developed quite a name for himself and his restaurant groups. Most people will know him because of the French Laundry in Napa which led to a ton of other restaurants that he eventually opened in NYC. They're famous for a reason as his food is really second to none. Some of my fondest memories of my trip to the French Laundry was definitely the baked goods. Served hot in a basket, we were offered various types of bread multiple times throughout the night. We even got to take home some shortbread cookies at the end of the night!  Thinking about all that great food had me nostalgic for some of Keller's cooking. Bouchon Bakery is part of his restaurant group and somehow we bumped into it. We are always looking for that perfect U.S. baguette and a good almond croissant. The fragrance of fresh baked goods drew us over so we had to check them out! Instead of a baguette today, we got an epi (small one) and an almond croissant.   The epi was not bad but tough to eat. Had to really work my jaw muscles. Perhaps heating it up would have made a difference. The almond croissant looked perfect on the outside (in fact for those who did enjoy it, you can find a recipe online!) but it didn't hit the spot for me. I felt that the almond paste was not sweet or smooth enough. For me, the perfect almond croissant needs to be buttery to the point you almost lose all the flakiness of the croissant. Then the almond paste should be silky/buttery smooth with tons of sugar but not masking the incredibly rich notes of almond. This paste should fill the pastry so that every bite you got a mouthful.  Unfortunately, we did not find what we were looking for here this time. Will always be willing to give a Keller restaurant another try. The baked goods today just didn't quite do it for me.",

Ironically I've gone to Bouchon Bakery in Vegas more than the Yountville location despite living in CA. The TKO is my favorite thing from there and I always buy a few for myself and a few for a couple of friends who always bring me back TKOs when they go to either Vegas or Yountville haha. I really love the chocolate cookies, and the cream is nicely light too, not too sugary. The perfect Oreo! (I gave one to my bf but he wasn't too impressed, I think in part bc the cookies had gone a little stale by the time we had them and he's not even a big fan of Oreos anyway. Bah! Haha.) As for the other baked goods, they're pretty good but not outstanding enough for me to buy much else except perhaps a couple of giant macarons. 5 stars for the TKO but 4 stars otherwise.",

Staff asks for your order way far in ahead before you are actually able to see the glass refrigerated selection of sandwiches and the chalkboard menu. You are only able to see the display of non refrigerated pastries. People like myself who were going for the first time did not see offerings on the opposite side until it was time to pay. I would of order other things to try had I seen that.",

I was able to try the Monkey bread, Chocolate au Pain, Chocolate almond croissant, cinnamon roll, and the small chocolate bouchon (Sounds like a lot but I reluctantly shared with my friends). The best pastries were the Chocolate almond croissant and the monkey bread. Both were extraordinarily done and required a 5-star yelp review. The chocolate au pain was very good as was the remainder of the pastries.   Best $4 I spent in Vegas.

My work used to require me to make annual trips here and I'd try a few of their offerings while staying at its host hotel the Venetian.  I remember it being right by the room elevators adjacent to the breakfast restaurant and the theater (Phantom of the Opera was playing then) as mentioned in the title.  My choices then were likely almond or chocolate croissants and they obviously weren't memorable... croissants are meant to be eaten warmed.  Recently, a friend who was in Vegas for work kindly presented me with this familiar box (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=M0ZaL3GlUW1TF85QIky6mQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).  Since I was a little hungry after a Warriors' game, I couldn't wait to try one, so apologies for the less-than-artistic photo of my treats(<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wlFij2g2JMY96KRYVb2oyw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).  I can't remember the flavors as my generous friend did not list them, leaving me to do challenge my taste buds/palate.  I believe they were chocolate, strawberry, pistachio, coffee or mocha, lemon, and a mystery flavor.  They lasted two days as I didn't want to spoil my figure by devouring them in one sitting... again, round is a figure.  My local source for satisfying my macarons craving is on Pine and Fillmore but sadly, after their revamp, they no longer make them (now offering choux instead).  Haven't searched bakeries in the City for these French treats so can't say who has the best in the City these days; the last local shop I tried was probably the one inside the Ferry Building.  Yes, their main and flagship store is only about an hour away, but it shows how much I get out of town these days.    Thanks to the generous friend who shared the love (= sugar) from her Vegas trip with me.  Hope I get to choose my treats next time I'm there.",

I settled on \"Oh Oh\" which is a chocolate cake with cream roll, a fancier version of Swiss Rolls. Just not as sweet, but sugar flavor was still bit over powering. Chocolate did not have the depth of bitterness to combat this, and it ended up being unimpressive. Looks pretty, but that's the extent.",

They have a range of flavors like Chocolate, Vanilla, Pistachio, and Raspberry (I like the Pistachio one the best) They also have seasonal flavors like Cherry Chocolate, lemon and strawberry (the strawberry one this case was bomb). The price for one is ok. I ordered an Iced Latte once which was good, but its really strong coffee so if you like Dunkin Donuts it's a complete reversal. For this review, I am referring to the Bouchon inside the Venetian Casino, not the one near Las Vegas Blvd. There's actually two. Another good thing about this establishment is that since it's located at the Venetian you get free parking on the Strip! I would definitely come back because the macarons are the best I have had, there is no inconvenient parking and there's no wait time!",

The last time we went we got 12 macarons and a coffee and spent about $50. There is a buy 5 get 1 free deal, so in my head I make  myself think that I am spending so much just to get a deal.   When you first bite into this cookie you get the slight crunch of the outside shell then a cake like consistency, then chewy, and THEN the most heavenly center of anything that could be a center of goodness(if that makes sense).  GAH IT IS SOO GOOD when it hits your lips.   My favorite flavors are the chocolate and vanilla.   The chocolate has the most amazing ganache that melts as soon as it hits your tongue. Usually I think vanilla is too plain for me, but this is not the case here. You can see the vanilla beans from the pods and it is so light and sweet, just amazing.  STOP READING AND GO GET SOME!!!",

    "text": "I ate brunch here yesterday morning with my mother. I called ahead to see if they took reservations I was told they did not. So when we arrived we were told about a 30 to 35 minute wait. We asked to be seated in the section nearest the glass doors. When They first called us to seat us about 30 minutes later they offered us a table that is a shared bench with others. We told the hostess we prefer to not have that kind of seating and would rather have a table by the glass doors. I mentioned they had five open tables and perhaps we could have one. Hostess told me that the tables are reserved. I told her that when I called I was told I could not reserve a table. She then told me that they keep those tables open for the owner or the owner's brother in case they come in. Of course I found this to be absurd. I know that highrollers get better service but I still found this to be quite absurd. So we sat down to await a better table. About 10 minutes later another hostess trier to seat us at another table with a shared booth. We told her again that we would like to have a regular table so she had us wait again. About another 15 to 20 minutes went by and another host came to seat us and tried to seat us in a bigger table with a shared bench. Just as he was doing that one of the original hostesses came over and told him that we wanted a table. I gestured to the now four open tables and he said that they're reserved. I thanked him but told him we were going to just leave. He said he didn't want us to leave so he gave us one of the tables that we had asked about. Frankly, we used to love this place. We always came here whenever we are in Las Vegas. The food and service has always been impeccable. This time the servers were nice, but  just overworked. The \"sticky bun\" was pretty dry and frankly not very good. The petite d'jeunre American was just OK and the croque madame, which I've had each time I've been here, was not very good. I asked for the egg to be over easy and it came out almost totally well done. Sadly, I don't see any need to come back here again which is disappointing, because we really liked the restaurant.",

They offer an interesting array of macaroon flavors like egg nog, latte, pistachio, wild berry; however, the flavors are not equally good.

I liked my almond croissant alot. It was filled with almost paste, just the way I like it. My husband had the chocolate croissant although he said he expected it to wow him more. You know, Bouchon Bakery is part of the Thomas Keller empire after all. My husband did like their coffee alot.  As everyone else has said, the macarons are huge. I wasn't even that hungry for breakfast but had to get one to eat with my croissant. I ordered the coffee macaron but only later realized that I was given the chocolate macaron :/ The texture of the macaron was very good. Slightly crisp shell and soft in the inside.  Bouchon Bakery is a stand and does not have a seating area. So unless you are planning to bring your coffee and pastries back to your hotel room, I recommend taking them to the Grand Canal Shoppes area and sitting on one of the benches to enjoy your pastries and coffee while enjoying the canal views inside the Venetian.",

On our recent visit to Las Vegas we paid a pre-dinner visit to Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery. We couldn't make up our mind on what we wanted to try but eventually decided on a raspberry macaroon (good, up to par with Paris standards), the red velvet cupcake (meh! I've definitely had better - cake was dry and frosting had a strange taste to it, and sprinkles were tacky), and finally a chocolate tart (delish! can never go wrong with chocolate).   Bottom line, I've definitely had better but if your at the Venetian and desperate for something to fulfill your sweet tooth, this isn't a bad option. Just note that there's no seating there, you'll have to take your goodies to the nearby food court (which is clean and has plenty of seating) to consume.",

    "text": "California spoiled me with the discovery of macarons. My friends and I would take advantage of most opportunities to sample the macarons that any cafe had to offer. When I moved back, macarons became scarce and my craving was left unfulfilled. Cue the search on Yelp which led me to Bouchon and other patisseries on the Strip.  Most people get lost trying to find this hidden nook of baked goods, so remember that it's located underneath a set of escalators near a candy store. Also note that the bakery is separate from the restaurant. You'll also need to find another place to enjoy your treats since there's no seating area.  Along with their baked goods, Bouchon also offers sandwiches, salads and coffee. I opted for the raspberry and pistachio macarons. They both had strong distinct flavors, but the filling was too sweet for my liking. While I understand the difficulty of making macarons and that they're on the Strip, $3.50 for a macaron is pretty expensive despite how big they are. Their red velvet cupcake was moist and had more than enough icing on it.  There's no doubt that their pastries are of good quality, but I was left underwhelmed by their selection and some of their prices.",

It was perfectly savory and went really well with the delicious coffee that they serve there. The bakery is a great little breakfast place if you don't want to deal with the long wait at the actual Bouchon restaurant.  Other tasty morsels included their Apple Croissant,  Pain Au Chocolate (chocolate croissant) and their veggie bread.",

I all of a sudden felt ripped off but am too embarrassed to say \"oh, then I don't want the chocolate croissant\"  so fine. I paid it. And almost instantly regretted getting the chocolate croissant. It tasted like it's been sitting there for the entire day and was hard to bite into. Definitely not what I had dreamed of...a soft, flaky, buttery croissant :(  Thank God the Pb&J macaroon was delicious! It was chewy on the outside, peanut butter on the inside filled with strawberry jam in the center! But is this worth $3? NO WAY, JOSE! I complain when I have to pay $1.50 for a small macaroon!

Who wouldn't love those sweet cookie-like treats that are filled with butter cream, which are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside? Yum!!  *FYI- they are $3.50 each. But if you buy a box of 6 - you only pay $17.50 (buy 5 get 1 free)*  I have also tried the Chocolate Croissant, which was okay. It was nice and flaky. The chocolate was just right and not too sweet, but I think they should have put more in the croissant. My husband and I bought the Chocolate Cupcake a long time ago, but I remember that we threw it away because it was very dry and lacked flavor. However, 5 stars because did I mention.....  THE BEST MACAROONS EVER!! Enough said!",

I thought the pastries were nothing special and didn't make an impact on me. They weren't awful but not so memorable either.   Red velvet cupcake - wasn't even red.. more like diluted washed out red. Cream cheese icing was good but there was too much of it. I liek my cupcakes moist but this wasn't. I've had way better red velvet cupcakes.  Bread pudding cake - Presentation was great. Looking at it made me salivate. Tasting it however, was not so great. Dry and bland.   Chocolate tart - great texture but the taste once again disappointed me. Some I can see why people would like this but it was way to rich for me. Everytime I took a bite it felt like it got stuck to the roof of my mouth. I want to eat chocolate... not peanut butter.  I've been told their macrons are good but I didn't get a chance to try it. Maybe next time? I do want to try Bouchon Bistro though...",

For little more than the average person would spend at Starbucks, you get to sample something that feels like head-mutha French chef of 20 Michelin stars spent quite some time devising.  The carrot cake-cookie that everyone raves about has a nice, subtle flavor and quite an appealing texture. Even better was the fruit tart here. Damn, that thing had a delicious crust! Hate how tarts are often soggy or stale from sitting out for too long in bakeries? For something like three, four dollars, Bouchon selflessly saves tart-lovers of the world from tired pasts of display-shelf deception and consequent grief.   This humanitarian aid station can be found near the Venetian elevators to the guest rooms.",

I always buy the gift box for about twenty bucks, and see if I can resist opening it and eating them until I get home.  Usually makes it till about the plane ride back.  More stuff you should try: the beignets filled with raspberry will put any doughnut to shame (and I AM an avid Krispy Kreme fan), the chocolate bouchons are heavenly, and as someone else said here, the best Red Velvet Cupcake I've ever had, in the world, ever, period.

I stayed at the Venetian Hotel and Casino for one major reason. Thomas freaking Keller! Whether I was dining at Bouchon Bistro or snacking on treats from Bouchon Bakery, I followed Keller like a fly on a horse's butt! First trip consisted of one of there famous macaroons which I didn't see what the fuss was. I got the vanilla flavor but maybe they only taste good when they first bring them down because mine was a little on the stale side. While the vanilla cream inside was good the stale outside just ruined it.   Second trip was a little more successful. I ended with the famous Thomas Keller's version of a Nutter Butter and a freshly baked Chocolate Donut with a custard filling. The Nutter Butter was good, much better than the cookie, with a peanut butter cookie on the outside and delicious peanut butter on the inside making it a perfect little treat! Move over Dunkin Donuts because I run on Thomas Keller's Donuts. Perfectly shaped donut with a wonderful custard feeling with chocolate icing and chocolate sprinkles on top. MMMMMM Donut was the only thing that kept popping in my head while eating it! If I had a Bouchon Bakery near me I would be the size of a whale.   Third trip was my favorite. I got the Carrot Cake Cookie. It tasted so fresh and moist and looks just like that big cookie in the movie \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" that the ants were eating on. Hopefully ya'll know what I'm talking about. Just like the ants I couldn't get enough. It had that nice little spice that carrot cake has with a wonderful cream inside that reminded me of the cream in those oatmeal cookies I got growing up in my school lunches. Just a perfect cookie!  Last and final trip, a tear slowly ran down my eyes while I made my final purchase, was Red Velvet Cupcake with a Citrus Frosting. While cheesecake is my favorite desert, red velvet is my second and this cupcake is the reason why. I got it as soon as they came down from baking, it was perfectly moist with a wonderfully rich cream cheese feeling inside a nice citrus frosting on top with a cute little smiley face made of chocolate chips reminding me it was Halloween. It was very rich but very good!  All I can say is thank you Thomas Keller for being the genius you are and making my trip oh so sweet!",

The vanilla macaroon was very good! It had a nice chew and a perfect light exterior and the filling wasn't too sweet. The vanilla flavor was good too. The TKO was just ok to me. The chocolate cookie part was very rich and good, but I wasn't into the filling. While the outside was very similar to an Oreo, the inside missed the mark and I think it would be better if they change it. Overall, it was worth it for the macaroon!",

The space is so small that the goods here are prepared at the restaurant upstairs and bussed down to the lower level.  I was really hankering for a macaron but the flavors that day (raspberry, orange, espresso) didn't persuade me.  I got a ham and cheese baguette and a lemon currant scone.   The baguette was okay.  It came with two little sides of mayonnaise and cornichons.  I got it toasted, which now I felt I shouldn't have because it takes away from the texture of the bread.  A bummer was that the cheese wasn't even melted and there was an excessive amount of ham.    The lemon currant scone was fairly good but I didn't find that it differed much from other scones I've had in the past.  The lemon flavor is subtle.",

Eventually we had the vanilla macaroon and the carrot cake cookie after a little insisting from the ladies behind the counter.  the macaroon was heavenly and the carrot cake was just OK. maybe we should've gone with our first instinct and gotten the TKO instead of carrot cake.      definitely need to go back to try different flavors of macaroons, croissants, TKO and possibly the baguette.  since the baguette was EXCELLENT I'm assuming they are made the same way.    As other people mentioned, don't go too far out of your way to hit up the bakery, but if it's close or you are in the venetian it may be worth it.  expensive, but worth it for the macaroons in my opinion.",

I also tried their raspberry and pistachio macarons, which were also wonderful.    This little place is tucked behind the escalator on the first floor of the Venetian (Casino level) next to the Grand Lux Cafe and Guest elevator entrance area, across from the Apothecary store.  Prices are high, but typical for what you see at the Venetian.  It is worth the splurge.  Note: Bouchon Bakery is located separately from the Bouchon restaurant, which is found on the 10th floor of the Venetian.",

    "text": "3.75 stars.    Croissant: crisp and buttery, but not the best I've had.  It might have been better if I'd had it earlier in the day.  Pain au chocolat: Again good, but not the best.  The chocolate had never fully melted and the croissant was on the dry side.  Pain epi with butter and cherry preserves: A great deal at $1.75.  Pretty crusty, but in a way that I like.  I'm not sure what kind of butter it was, but it was very good, as were the cherry preserves.  This was my favorite item.  Lemon Macaron: I have only had macarons a couple of times, and I'm not sure I'm a fan, so I don't think I'm the best judge of this.  The texture was light and crisp on the outside, then chewy, then gooey in the middle.  I think it's the goo I don't like.    I've had some very good pastries, so I judge pretty harshly.  If you are visiting from an area that doesn't have as many options, I would highly recommend checking this out.    These are made right, and this is probably among the top 5 bakeries I have been to.  It was lovely to have this available right near the guest elevators.",

    "text": "This is a cute little stand in the Venetian Hotel.  We came here at about 8am in the morning specifically for their macarons.  My current obsession is this light, chewy little cookie.  I ordered the caramel, coffee, red velvet and my friend ordered the vanilla and chocolate.  She wanted to see why I was making such a big deal about these cookies. Bouchon's macarons are bigger than the normal macarons and hence the price tag of $3.50.   So far, these are the best macarons in the US I've had since returning from Paris.   The cookie has a nice consistency and the center has a slight chewiness.  It's like a sweet party in your mouth.  My friend tried them and her exact words were \"oh, now I see what you're talking about, these things are delicious!\"  I definitely plan to return here to try the other macaron flavors when I return to Vegas!",

All of my friends have been ranting and raving about macarons, and I wanted to see what the hype was all about!  I guess I had high expectations..  I expected a nice large bakery, but it was small.. and had a few selections. The price of one macaron is $3.50.. it cost a lot more than what i thought it was worth! I bought 6, only because I didnt know when i would try them again, and I dont know where I can find these in San Diego.   Im really glad i bought that many because they ended up tasting really good! Theyre super sweet, and delicious. My favorite has to be the vanilla macaron. Highly recommend! Customer service was great, and the location of this bakery was far from the nasty smoking smell in the casino!",

Our server was super sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu.  He started us off with a pastry of our choice and I had a cream puff (Amelia Bedilia would've been proud).  Next, I was having a hard time choosing what to eat, so he suggested I chose the corned beef and I'm so glad he did!  Let me tell you folks, the French do corned beef WAY BETTER than your granny or your mama!!  It was like chunks of jerky-esque beef and delicate diced potatoes.  My eggs were fluffy and perfect and the seasoning for this whole dish was absolutely wonderful!  I just wish my stomach had been prepared for this meal...it defeated me!  Lastly, we headed over to the bakery and picked up some pastries for the road (not like it made it \"home\") and again, the staff was very cordial and helpful.  I will DEFINITELY be back; it's only a question of when!!",

    "text": "We were getting ready to leave for the airport and wanted to get a bite to eat in the hotel before we left.  It was close, on the way out to the airport and we assumed it would probably kick the crap out of any airport food you could get.    Here's what we sampled:  Turkey Brie Sandwich: Brie, lettuce, roast turkey, and mustard.  Warmed and pressed, the bread had a texture of a ciabatta which was good, the creaminess of the brie got a little sticky and runny in the sandwich after heating it, and I liked the aroma and texture of melted brie in any way shape or form.  Still, I have to admit, this didn't outstanding, it was good, but the taste wasn't any different from a sandwich that I could have made myself.  Vegetable jardiniere Sandwich: With Portabello mushroom, eggplant, fennel, caramelized onions, picquillo pepper, fontina cheese and pesto.  My g/f ordered this.  Oh my goodness.  This is the sandwich I SHOULD have ordered from the start.  It is a vegetarian sandwich, but the meatiness of the mushrooms, the texture of the eggplant, with the aromatics and crisp bite from the fennel.  Each bite was almost a unique cathartic experience, you had a mixture of caramelized onions, the mellow heat and body from the pepper and the melted fontina cheese was able the sit carefully on the knife edge on being flavorful and robust but also remained delicate enough it didn't overpower the sandwich.  Seriously, my g/f loved this sandwich so much, it was almost impossible for me to get additional bites, I even offered her a trade on our sandwiches, where she simply smiled at me and continued eating.  This was a fantastic sandwich that even me; a devote carnivore, feel as though this was a sandwich that I would be happy to eat on a regular basis.   Chocolate bouchons:    Their name was given due to the fact that they are shaped like the corks from bottle of wine.  Without a doubt they certainly taste better then the real corks, these little morsels were rich and super moist, with little chocolate bits inside.  It reminds me of a brownie, a damn good one at that.  Chocolate Eclair:    This was my dessert, me being the chocoholic after first glance when I saw it in the glass enclosure, I didn't stand a chance.  The choux pastry dough, was light and airy, carried a light and subtle sweetness, additionally the chocolate creme patissiere was decadent and smooth, and there was a rich slathering of more chocolate right on top, creating a lovely balance with each intoxicating mouthful.    Lemon Tart:    My g/f's choice, and quite honestly she has bested me once again, in terms of picking the item I would get again, the lemon filling almost reminded me of a lemon curd; with all the zest that they put in you could really taste the fresh lemons, the wonderful level of acidity balanced with a creamy richness.  Most notably, is the crust, here rather then to just do a pie crust or a simple graham cracker crust, they went with a fresh pine nut crust, the pine nuts created a great aroma, nutty texture with a crisp crunch.  With each bite of the two elements, with their contrasting flavors, and textures melded together creating a absolutely amazing dish.  It's a must try for those that have yet to experience this, and one I'll be getting next time.  Parisian Macaroons  Appearance wise these were stunning, I bought a couple of boxes to take back home as gifts, and even though up front they ran out, the staff were kind enough to go into the back room and make the rest to complete our order.  Wonderful presentation and colors, I was told that they each had different flavors, (which included lemon, orange, strawberry, vanilla, mocha and chocolate.)  Basically, we had a delay and ultimately a cancelled flight so me and my g/f may have dug into one of the boxes, you know we had to sample the gift we were giving and we did want to make sure the gift we were about to give was fresh since our next flight would be the next day.  So we sampled a box.  Rich, chewy and super dense, with a wonderful flavor sandwiched with a very thin layer of creme.  If I had to rate it in the order of preference, it went vanilla, coffee, lemon, chocolate, strawberry and orange.  Goes really well with a nice cup of plain coffee as well!  The next day on our way back for attempt #2 to the airport, we stopped by one more time here and replenished the macaroons gift box that we consumed while taste testing it.  So make sure next time your here go ahead and give into whatever pastries and sweets you desire just make sure don't leave without trying the lemon tart and the Vegetable jardiniere!",

This time I was so excited to try my best drink here at Las Vegas and very disappointed. It was just a watery chocolate drink. I can get way better satisfied one from Starbuck with cheaper price. So disappointed...why is it different quality under same name and same price?",

The raspberry and salted caramel were OK, but pale in comparison to the pistachio. Knocked it down to 4 stars though because the chocolate almond croissant didn't live up to my expectation or past experiences. Have definitely had better, was a bit too hard and crunchy and lacked some of that light flakey texture you expect from a croissant. Would definitely come back for the macaron.",

Sadly, the coffee was terrible!! I ordered Anericanos two days in a row and was disappointed. They use one of those automated coffee machines vs. a traditional espresso machine, so the coffee tasted like drip. Needless to say, I won't be going back tomorrow. Go for the baked goods, but get your coffee elsewhere!",

    "text": "Anytime I'm by the Time Warner Center in NYC, I can't not stop by Bouchon Bakery to get a TKO or some other pastry treats. So when the GF's family and I were in Vegas, I knew I had to bring them by Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian.  Pro-Tip: If it's your first time, you will get lost trying to find this small outpost so make sure you leave enough time if you've got other events on the agenda! After asking 4 different staff members and getting 4 different answers for two different floors, I ultimately lucked my way unto the Bakery. If you're walking towards the guest elevators, do NOT go up them. Instead, you'll find Bouchon Bakery literally behind the escalators.  Pistachio Macaron [$3.50]  I started off with a few macarons. Perfectly textured with a nice chew, the pistachio imparted a slightly nutty flavor which was nice.   Salted Caramel Macaron [$3.50]  You can't go wrong with the salted caramel, which had great depth and richness.   Better Nutter [$3.25]  The better nutter was better than your average Nutter Butter indeed. Within crisply thin cookies was a gorgeously creamy and light peanut butter that wasn't too intense. Pass the milk please!   TKO [$3.25]  But really we were here for the TKO. Better than your average Oreo, the juxtaposition of the creme and the bitter chocolate notes from the cookies brought me back to childhood indeed.   The pricing is admittedly a bit high, but you're paying for technique and precision from the pastry kitchen of Thomas Keller, one of America's notable chefs. So if you've got a sweet tooth and need to satiate that craving, head on over to Bouchon Bakery - if you can find it!",

Instead they wasted so much time arguing and a big crowd was waiting. I was waiting for my ham and cheese croissant to be warmed so had no choice but to wait. And at the end, my croissant wasn't even warmed! Even if the food is good I will not come here again and ensure such bad service. They should fire the operations manager for the poor job.",

I am unsure about all the flavors I had, but for sure:  Vanilla, Pistachio, Chocolate and Raspberry.  My favorite was the Raspberry and Pistachio!

We were the only ones in the store and there were at least 4 employees, including the manager Priscilla, who was the absolute worst of the bunch.   Right when we began to order, some employee (named Kat?) seemed utterly confused and annoyed that we wanted two separate orders. Is that such a difficult request?  After she takes both our orders to the register, she gets confused and asks us if we want to pay together. I said no, and once again, I'm met with a confused look. After a bit of commotion, another employee asks ME what is in the box, and after I tell her I'm not sure, she throws the box back down and proceeds to leave. I'm not asking to be treated like a princess, but if you don't know what's in the box, can't you just open it and check if it's my order or not?! Now I was actually getting annoyed at this point so I asked for the manager. Turns out the woman who was too lazy to check what was in my box WAS the manager.   Not sure if I caught them on a bad day or if they were too lazy to work, but thankfully there was one competent employee (blonde haired, tall male named Aaron?) who took the time to apologize for something he didn't even do.   I would've just left without any macarons after all that attitude and sass, but since they are soo good, I had to suck it up and stay. Delicious treats, but horrible employees (minus Aaron).",

The butter nutters were so creamy and butter and dreamy. Best peanut butter cookie I have ever had.   The macaroons are best fresh but hold well for a day or two. Soft flaky crust filled with rich sweet creamy ingredients.  Best cookies and macaroons. So rich fresh flavors. Service was good.",

I remembered this location and quickly ducked out of the conference to stop by to grab a coffee and breakfast pastry.  I was so glad because this location was basically empty when I stopped in.    Food:  You cannot go wrong with anything you order from their bakeries.  I've tried a number of things from them and my favorites are the oh-oh, chocolate croissant, mini brownie and toffee candy.  I usually order an iced vanilla latte for my coffee choice too; it's better than the coffee chains nearby.   Staff: Everyone is usually friendly and efficient with your order.  I never have to wait too long even if the line is long.   Location: this one is tucked away outside of the Venetian. It's upstairs from the Walgreens. Because it's kind of tucked away the line never gets that long.",

We've been hooked from our first visit and have been coming here ever since :)   Items tried and liked (so far):  -Cinnamon Roll -Cheese Danish -Chocolate Chunk Cookie -Oatmeal Raisin Cookie -TKO  -Better Nutter -Chocolate Almond Croissant -Kouign Amann  -Macaroons  -Bouchon Brownies -Bouchon Oh Oh -Croissants  -Pain au Chocolait -Pan au Raisin -Coffee Cake -Shortbread  -Iced Chai -Sandwiches   Usually at other bakeries we try many different items only to be left disappointed and end up liking just a few items.  But not here everything we've tried has been delicious and worth every calorie ^-^  Prices are reasonable compared to other bakeries around town. Staff are always helpful, knowledgeable & friendly.  Service is quick & efficient. They have a total of 3 bakeries in the hotel but the one located near the Venetian Theatre usually has mostly everything in stock.  If they are out of something try one of their other locations.   Overall a great place to grab a delicious treat :) I hope you decide to give Bouchon Bakery a try!",

On our way to the airport I had the uber driver stop at the Venetian. It's great that the app allow you to do that!  To be sure they had the kouign amanns, ordered them the day before and paid for them using my credit cared ( they require payment in advance).  Valerie was really nice taking my order and set the pickup time perfectly  Now I had \"gifts\" for my kids.   On to the airport... I have one to our uber driver since he knew nothing about them.

There are two bakeries, one across the Venetian Theatre underneath the escalators and another street side by the Strip. Like I said, little holes in the Venetian!   I am a fan of Chef Thomas Keller and have been to  'French Laundry' in Napa as well as his Bouchon Restaurant several times and little bakeries in the Venetian. Like I said, I am a fan!  I have never been disappointed with his food, baked items or service in any establishments.  Everything in these little bakeries are baked in the restaurant and brought down daily.   You really cannot go wrong with whatever you choose. I have chosen several over the years from cupcakes, cookies, croissants, sandwiches, macrons, etc. You name it, I have probably ingested it. For sweets the cupcakes are a favorite of mine because they change with the season. If you go during the holidays, you will find fun holiday themed pastries.  Coffee is also served at Bouchon bakeries, so you can grab a coffee and pastry to go any time of the day. You may need to check the hours because Bouchon Bakery is not open 24/7 but they are open early in the morning.  Enjoy your Bouchon!",

    "text": "\"Paris is always a good idea they, say!\"  This line coined by Audrey Hepburn!   Bouchon is the slice of Paris here in Las Vegas! The French know simple, delicious, elegant flavors of food customization options.   Best kept secret in Las Vegas is Bouchon, order your food from the restaurant and dine down here by the cafe. Their is always seating, and the views are amazing. Watch the gondolas on the canals as they sail along. The endless tourists and enjoy themselves as they pass your table. Once in a great while someone will wave hello. Be polite and wave back. Your in the most beautiful spot. Umbrella over head, the beautiful Las Vegas spring breeze on your shoulder moving and messing up your hair. Let the wind toss your hair around. That coffee in my hand stimulates my mind and relaxes me. As the morning moves along I decided to have a Mimosa too. Nothing like treating your orange juice to some Champagne.   Our most recent visit was for breakfast. The waffles that we enjoyed were covered with strawberries. These waffles we're so fluffy that my fork just melted all the way through as I cut them. The whip cream pairing on the side was nice since one can add as you go along. Those strawberries were fresh cut that day. Their is no butter needed on these waffles as it would break that delicious flavor balance.   What is more shiny the sparkling pastries that are behind the glass shining back at ya or the smiles from the staff here. Let's easily say both. The warmth is overwhelming as you order since the staff here make the store glow with such light. I frequent Bouchon when ever in need of fabulous individuals that make me smile. The pastries are beyond irresistible. The feeling of the staff is such an incredible plus as they provide such alluring food with fantastic service. I have heard the staff here take a beating from tourists from all over. They smile and keep going. The light in the staff here never stops glowing. What an incredible place to be apart of? No wonder the pastries taste so unbelievably yummy it's all that love that is created among the employees. At least the negative comments that they receive here never take away from anyone's experience. They enhance and provide so much joy every time I visit here!  What good here do many ask? Bouchon's pastries are intoxicating with such unavoidable temptation. One should watch out, truly! Once you answer the beckoning call, no other pastry will ever measure up. One of my favorites is their cheese Danish. We can of course, Salut, the French for the dough that took the world by storm because the baker made a mistake . It's all in the butter that baker so long ago forget, and ended up with a light, airy, fluffy crust that we long for so much today. The Europeans love their danish cloud and fluffy which is always full of flavor. The lighter the dough the better the taste anyways. Bouchon has not forgotten their French roots and deliver that delicious airy design pattern of making pastries that never quits. Their cheese Danish has a delicate, lightly sweetened inner core  and the outer shell is breakable and cloud like. Put it together and it's a soft delightful masterpiece of exquisite expression.   The primary pastries offered here practically never change, such as cheese Danish, croissant, macaroons, cinnamon rolls, donuts, and other traditional offerings. On a good week Bouchon offers Beignets that are a masterpiece of delicious happiness all in a single hole. When you can find them. The Beignets that are made here do not last very long. Truly they sell out incredibly fast. If you are ever up early with a raspberry craving now you know where to satisfy that satiating hunger. The little Beignets devils are so tempting that sin never tasted so soulful. The Beignets are filled with raspberry rouge cream that as you bite into that hole your senses tingle and twinkle a little. Sensational truly. The Beignets are sold in doubles, twice the fun. These little cinnamon and sugar coated beauties are $3.5 ! Such perfection at a cost that will leave some change for the lovely joyful crew serving up your daily love and happiness.   Find you right balance. The simplest things are always the best in life. For those that crave that French way of enjoyment with the simplicity of coffee and Beignets with a beautiful view look no further. The cappuccino is fantastic here in the morning with substitutes allowed for those of us who enjoy almond milk. The crew is always in a wonderful mood provides smiles for free with the incredible deliciousness cut with a fork!",

The staff was chatting away without making any drinks and there was no one else in there so I was confused as to why my lattes was taken so long. Although the staff could clearly see me waiting no one asked me about it. Finally I asked about my latte and turns out they didn't know anything about it.   Although the person who rang me up was friendly everyone just seemed very inattentive. I can't imagine coming here during a busy time if it was this bad with no one else there.   As far as the food goes, the display case really didn't seem so appetizing and just very common over all. Nothing about the croissant or coffee stood out. I expected more honestly.",

    "text": "We decided to make a quick stop here for breakfast and for coffee before we drove out to California. We walked down the strip to The Venetian, and started to look for the bakery. Since we couldn't find any signs pointing the way, we stopped and asked someone. We were told that it was upstairs on the 10th floor. We continued on through the casino and then asked someone else, who pointed us around the corner, where we found the bakery.   We later discovered that it wasn't the full bakery, but a little quick-buy section. We ordered a Madeline, some macarons, a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant as well as coffee. The macarons were outstanding, the coffee and the vanilla ones were the best. They were beautifully flavored and lovely and chewy, but crisp. The rum ones, and a few other flavors, weren't as good, but were still tasty. The croissants and the madeline were tasty, but quite stale, which was a huge disappointment.  To top it off, our big was huge. It was close to $50, which is ridiculous for a few baked goods and two coffees, especially since half the stuff we bought was stale, and we bought it in the morning.",

Don't bother with the drip coffee or espresso drinks here; it's like drinking water.  I'm also not a fan of their madeleines--they were flavorless and foamy.  But everything else I've had?  Phenomenal!    Try the croissants (especially the STRAWBERRY ones), Parisian macarons (coffee, vanilla, and pistachio are my favs), their muffins, the red velvet cupcake, their focaccia, and the PB&J brioche.  The eponymous bouchons are just okay, but are definitely satisfying if all you want is to fulfill a chocolate-y craving.",

(OK, my boss pays for the trip under the pretense of sending me to the Consumer Electronics Show- but he's really just making an effort to keep me on staff by paying for me to get my Bouchon macaroon fix.)  It's a little bakery stand in The Venetian.  You'll find a couple of locations scattered around.  There are two (one upstairs, one downstairs) up on the north end where there's a raised walkway across the strip to TI & Mirage.  I tend to go to the upstairs one, as it's on my walk over to the Expo center, and the CES shuttle busses to the LVCC.  I've seen a few walk-in closets bigger than the stand I frequent- but as long as it's big enough to hold the macaroons (and an attendant to sell them to me, along with a cup of coffee), that's all that matters.  The macaroons seem a little high-priced (but what in Vegas isn't?), but once you take a bit, you'll know instantly that you would pay more.  They're delicate and chewy all at the same time.  Not overly sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy a bakery craving.  The outer shell crumbles nicely, and the core is creamy and firm.  I dream about these macaroons.  You need one.  Go get one- or a dozen.",

I have gone to both of Bouchon's other locations in NYC and Napa inquiring about their focaccia bread, and discovered that this Vegas location is the ONLY location to serve their focaccia bread. And now... they killed it entirely. WTF.  In an attempt to substitute my previous coveted snack, I got their ham & cheese baguette, which was super boring & nothing special at all. I also bought a beignet to go w/ my coffee the next day, and upon biting into it, I found out that it was chock-full of jelly. Bleh. Might as well have just called it a jelly doughnut. They also make you buy their beignets in pairs. Lame.  I'm only keeping their rating at 3 stars 'cuz their petite macaroon set & chocolate bouchons made for great gifts to bring back home. Their coffee was also good. BUT, I'm still pissed that they took off their focaccia bread. Hmpf.",

Sis (who knows nothing about coffee) takes it back (cuz my moms a queen like that ) and tells them \"it doesn't taste right\".

I didn't love the chocolate pudding because I expected more of a mousse-like consistency instead of feeling fine sugar crystals on my tongue.  At $3.50, it was probably the cheapest item I bought there.  I don't think I can afford to bring back cookies or jam as a souvenir.  I like the packaging and silverware.    I recommend the apple croissant, chocolate, and lemon tarts.  I still have an apple tart and chocolate almond croissant left over.  The oatmeal is very plain without milk.  A woman waiting saw me pick it up at the drink counter and said, \"good for you!\".  The beignets are filled with chocolate or raspberry.    The orange juice seems expensive but I was tempted to buy the carafe.  Their hot chocolate is satisfying for a light breakfast.  Tomato foccacia is okay.  Its topped with feta over olive oil or pesto.  When I asked the clerk for recommendations of soft bread for someone with a cough, he couldn't give me any tips.",

My wife LOVED their almond brioche and I loved their ham and cheese sandwich - which doesn't sound like much, but they use a freshly baked baguette, and the ham has been slow-cooked so it's very delicate and moist.  They spread a little bit of sweet butter and Dijon mustard and BAM, best ham and cheese sandwich EVER.    Add a tall cup of freshly squeezed orange juice and you're ready to start another day in Vegas!  They even have pet treats you can get for your dogs!  Awesome!

    "text": "After walking up and down the Vegas strip all day, I wanted a light sweet snack. At Bouchon Bakery (which recently opened a second spot also in The Venetian, next to the Venetian Sports Book), it's about the macarons, those light meringue confections that can be one of a zillion different colors.  Here, they also have chocolate-coated macarons. Haven't had that one before, so I ordered the raspberry one ($4.50). Perfectly executed. Extremely light, with a thin chocolate coat. The hint of raspberry flavor goes well with the chocolate.  I also got the Apple Croissant ($3.75), a butter croissant with thinly sliced apples and baked almond cream filling, topped with almond streusel. Huge thumbs up here. Velvety filling, flaky pastry. Not too sweet. Basically, it just kicks ass -- and I got way more bang for my buck here than with the macaron.  Frankly, the price is really the only thing that would prevent me from just dashing right back and ordering one of everything in the display case. A fine example of how one must pay for quality. Plus, it's located on the Strip, so it'll automatically be hella expensive.  The person at the counter tried to sell me on getting some cookies as well. Not this time, but who knows. I could end up getting a cookie bender in Vegas one day.  At the end of the day, I thought Bouchon Bakery was worth the stop!",

There's apparently 3 locations within the Venetian Casino, I managed to find two out of three. This one I found was near one of the hotel entrances.  The line builds up quickly, so if you've heard of Bouchon or can smell the pastry, get in line! And no cutting!!!!  Tried their regular and chcolat croissant---they nailed it perfectly just like the ones in Paris.  Vanilla and chocolate eclair: so damn yummy. Each bite explodes of flavor, I'll leave that to you to think about.  What they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the  overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am.   Another note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic. That definitely needs to be improved because not noting what they just made or even a name to a particular drinks= many pissed off faces standing by a counter that only lets one person get to it to get a drink. One. at. a. time.  Oh dear...",

    "text": "I've just recently grown fond of Parisan macarons, so Thomas Keller's little creations were in order. The bakery doesn't provide a sitting area, but it's a great place for a quick grab and go. Showcasing countless selections of morning pastries and snacks, it was difficult choosing only a limited few. Between the 3 of us, we walked away with a slice of pesto, tomato, & feta foccacia bread, pistachio macaron, pear & apricot glazed bread pudding, strawberry croissant, mini chocolate bouchons, and a box of half dozen macarons for the flight home. $48 for everything was a major rapage, but well worth it.  The pesto foccacia was very moist and flavorful, but a bit on the greasy side. Appropriate to indulge if you need to recover from a nasty hangover. Bread pudding was a major surprise, but the richness and density in each bite was overwhelmingly filling. I wish I could have stomached more, but at least my left overs lasted 2 days later and still tasted just as amazing.   For the box of macarons, we had pistachio, raspberry, vanilla bean, lemon, mocha, & chocolate. Favorites listed that order as well. The texture is much more dense than what I'm used to, but the cream filling won me over. Not sure how many of these babies I can devour over a cup of coffee, but they're certainly a delectable treat. I'm curious to try the beignets and lemon tart during my next visit.  The bakery is hidden right next to the Phantom Theater. Again, no seating available, so take your treats upstairs and hang out at the Coffee Bean.",

Bouchon Bakery, you tried to hide from me by tucking yourself underneath the elevators and stairs in the Venetian but my macaron senses started to tingle as my foot hit the casino floor and I instinctively walked behind the elevators.   $17.50 for a box of 6 (chocolate, vanilla, coffee, lemon, orange, raspberry)? Only in Vegas will I splurge, but is each one worth like $3.50? Given that fact that it's twice the size of normal macaroons and it has the perfect crispy crunch on the outside and soft chewy middle I'd say YES !! I also didn't expect the lemon to taste very good so it was the first one to go, but the boyf and I LOVEDD it!!   I still have a few leftovers because we were so stuffed from the buffets. These babies held up well in the heat + a 5+ hour trip home and are still good today.   Bouchon, until next time. I now know to buy more than half a dozen [;",

I don't think we went to the actual bakery because I didn't see half the desserts people are posting in pictures. We asked an employee of the hotel and she directed us to a small shop upstairs foe the casino with only a small selection of desserts. We didn't mind because we were going only for the macarons. I was hesitant and couldn't believe I was spending almost 20 bucks on 6 cookies. I've never had a macaron and was nervous because what if they were gross? Luckily, these were so good!! We got vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, pumpkin, PB and jelly, and pistachio. They looked so beautiful in the box! I tried the vanilla first. I loved the texture! Soft and chewy and so good! The PB and Jelly was my absolute favorite and the chocolate was my daughters favorite. Least favorite was the pumpkin. The pistachio and vanilla tastes very similar to me but we're still delicious! So glad we finally tried this place. Unfortunately, it's located on the strip and we don't go down there often but just might have to make a special trip for another PB and Jelly! Yum!!",

Their pastries are definitely less sweet compared to other patisseries and the chocolates are more decadent-which is fantastic! I've also been to the Beverly Hills location and it tastes relatively similar! Coffee is a darker roast, but the flavor is pretty chocolate-y with a nice finish! Very comforting for the tired body and totally soothes my soul. 10/10 would recommend!",

Grabbed pastries: Butter croissant, sticky bun and one of the giant macarons.  Took bites of said pastries.  Disgusted by dryness and staleness.  Proceeded to feel very sad and disappointed. (Why bother having the bouchon trademark and serve stale goods?)  Talked with girl who sold us pastries - after some discussion she refunded the order (at least there was that). So let's start with what was wrong.  (-1) For having the dryest butter croissant. It looked soo good and flaky. But darn can looks be deceiving.  (-1) For having the morning sticky bun that was made two mornings ago. They claimed these were baked fresh... but i've made sticky buns myself and they didn't taste that stale (the butter in the caramel had almost a rancid taste) even after days in the fridge.  (-1) For macaron that was frozen, not properly thawed, and then produced to ice while still being ice-cold. The worker claimed they were \"Refrigerated\". Unless in the cooking world -8C is refrigeration, something is wrong.  (+1) For the kind soul that refunded us the money. She seemed so lost and claimed thats how everything is \"supposed to taste\". Not sure if that's better or worse.    Anywho: I dont even want to give them a second shot. #sadness.",

    "text": "Annnnnd here we have the famous macarons of Thomas Keller, of French Laundry fame and so many cookbooks (including Ad Hoc, which is amazing). Given the name that Thomas Keller has made for himself, these just HAD to be the best macarons ever, right? (Well, other than Laduree in New York, which I've not had a chance to try yet (they actually invented the macaron as we know it, I believe).  So here I am, with a 3.50 macaron. Pricey? Yes, but this is a pretty big macaron too. I bite into it. The shell gives away under your bite, cracking and retaining a delicious crunchy exterior that is ever so delicate. My girlfriend gushes about how these are texturally, the best macarons ever. And I agree. Out of all of the macarons I've tried, the crispness and delicacy of the Bouchon macaron is supreme.  Too bad it doesn't taste like anything.   We got raspberry and their special flavor of the month (or week, or something?) which was strawberry lemon. I could BARELY taste the raspberry, and subsequent bites lost all flavor completely - I could taste the almond from the almond meal. And the strawberry lemon? A bit better, at least each bite tasted slightly like lemonade and not almonds.   If you're a texture hound, these are possibly the best I've had, but if you're like me, and desire macarons for the intense flavor profile that repeatedly wallops you in the face, Bouchon doesn't deliver.",

All three macarons were delicious -- I assume the pistachio was, since my husband got to it before I did. The raspberry was yummy, but the blueberry was my favorite. The floral berry taste was like eating an intense blueberry. I coudn't get enough.   The texture of the massive macarons (as big as my palm) was very refined, light, but crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfection.",

I feel sorry for the folks waiting in line at Carlo's Bakery...   So my star-rating is based on the three items that I got over and over again on my visit to Vegas:  Kouign Amann - If you're a croissant fan, then this sweet and slightly savory pastry most likely will please you, as it did me. I came back multiple times just because I was craving it. I'm craving it now as I type!  Strawberry Almond Croissant - This was tasty! Fresh strawberries are under the almond topping. It was a bit heavy... I ate it on the plane going home and promptly fell asleep.  Chocolate Bouchons - Everyone needs to get these little mini delicious brownies.  There are two bakery locations in the Venitian... this review is for the bakery next to the pedestrian overpass walkway to the Ti.",

    "text": "I've been to the Bouchon restaurants in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas.  Both experiences were okay but nothing particularly exceptional.  I've read a lot of good things about the Bouchon Bakery though so I was still eager to give it a try.  Bouchon Bakery is conveniently located near the guest elevators on the casino floor.  The bakery is a simple open storefront.  They have glass display counters showcasing the many attractive pastries and desserts while coffee is made/assembled in the background.  I went three times and it was busy on each visit; still, lines moved quickly each time because service was organized.  I had a good sampling of their offerings and most of what I had was good.  Here is the rundown.  (Pain Au Raisin) This was nice croissant dough that was mixed with golden and dark raisins.  The pastry was good.  It had a good crispness on the outside, but it still had a nice flakiness and softness at the center.  It was nicely sweet but not overpowering.  The raisins were plump and flavorful--too often raisins are overly shriveled in these types of pastries.  (Chocolate Bouchon) This was a chocolate brownie shaped like a wine cork.  The bouchon I had was dusted with powdered sugar.  It also had a little bit of fudgy chocolate ganache in the center, which may not have been the intention (a later bouchon I had seemed to lack this fudge).  The brownie was good.  Good, rich chocolate flavor and the appropriate texture of a brownie.  I have noticed that a lot of bakeries will alter the brownie recipe to create a moister brownie with a longer shelf life, which results in a fudgy brownie that is not really a brownie.  I like how the brownie here was baked as it should have been.  Because of that, the Bouchon here may not have been the moistest brownie, but it was still satisfying and thankfully still a brownie.  (Macarons) I had three here--caramel, vanilla and coffee.  All the flavors were good, but if I had to pick, I would probably say the caramel was the best.  Good and smooth cream centers that were flavorful.  The macarons' outside shells had a light crispness while the inside was soft and chewy.  The macarons here were larger than most macarons I've had (priced higher too at a little over $3 a piece).  (Chocolate Croissant) This (or maybe the apple croissant) was probably my least favorite thing here and it may have a lot to do with how I am not the biggest fan of chocolate croissants.  I think part of it has to do with how I don't like how big and soft they tend to be.  The croissant was light, crispy and flaky.  The croissant featured a thick and generous chocolate bar at the center.  The croissant was fine though it was very similar to the other good chocolate croissants I've had (and it did not really stand out).  (Apple Croissant) This pastry was not your typical apple pastry.  The bottom was a flat puff pastry base.  It was topped with apples and then a slightly crunchy and sweet cinnamon streusel-like topping (similar to a Dutch apple pie).  It tasted fine, but it was not as good as other apple pastries I've had.  The pastry base was a little firm and thick.  It lacked the light crispness and flakiness of a good croissant.  The apple flavor was not as prominent as I would have liked, which was mainly due to the generous portion of the cinnamon streusel (kind of overwhelmed the apple flavor).  Service was good and pleasant on all of my visits.  Pricing was about what you would expect with most of the options in the $3-$4 range.  I would imagine that most bakeries/pastry shops in Las Vegas (even bad ones) would be charging similar prices.  The quality at Bouchon Bakery was high and because the prices were reasonable enough, this one might be worth the extra walk or the extra casino hop if you get a hankering for a good pastry during your stay.  The Venetian offers complimentary valet parking.  Like other major casinos, I imagine they would have complimentary self-parking as well.",

I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more.   They seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners   The coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus.    First, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior.  That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie.  When we complained they said \"that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old\" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue.   I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them.   Do not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie.  Astounding.   The rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets.  The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up.   I hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up.",

Both croissants were light but yet had a crisp but not too crumby exterior.   Pistachio macaroon- the gold standard to which othet macaroons will be measured. Perfect crisp \"shell\" with a wonderful, chewy but not stale interior. The filling added to the cookie without taking away from it.

I consider myself somewhat of a macaron connoisseur, having discovered them while living in Paris a few years ago. The macarons at Bouchon are horrible. They are overly big, too dense and chewy, and over-refrigerated. They were not fresh or delicate at all. Not even holding them to the lofty standard of Pierre Herme or Laduree, they still pale in comparison to other places in NYC, San Fran, and Vancouver. We usually sit and savor every last crumb, but at Bouchon, we didn't even want to finish them. It was a chore. And way overpriced.  The only reason it gets two stars is because the TKO (like an adult Oreo cookie) was good.",

Note: the bakery is separate from the restaurant, it's on the lower floor where everything's at, near the convention center I think.   I came here based on Yelp reviews and of course I came here for the MACARONS! The eggshell-like cookie texture and soft, supple, and oozing center was on point and I suppose this is how an authentic macaron should be but I'm sure they don't compare to the ones from the Laduree in Paris. I hear the ones in Bottega Louie come close - my next target.  The macaron is like a mature, sophisticated, cultured, flamboyant, confident, well-dressed and sexy version of an oreo for all you macaron virgins (better yet, just look at the fuckin' pictures).  I got the packaged variety pack which cost around $17 and the price is worth every shining penny; definitely grab one, it includes 6 delightful pieces of art (each equivalent to an hour at the gym). The Pistachio macaron in particular was a tad larger than all the others (I've been told that Pistachio is the preeminent flavour to which all others will be judged) and this flavour was by far the best to lay on my hurricane tongue.  They have a plethora of other French/European pastries and stuff so I can't vouch for how exquisite they are or explain the nuances between the various croissants and what not.   Good luck finding the damn place; the search is worth it. The chick manning the register was a doll :-)",

The selection was slim. There was absolutely no one in sight.   I got the Pistachio and Espresso Macaroon. They were good in size. I enjoyed the fact that they were not TOO sweet, there was a lot of flavor.  It was pretty pricey for one macaroon...I wish they had a wider selection of pasteries.",

They have croissants, beignets, macarons, chocolate croissants, strawberry croissants, cheese danishes, almond croissants, sandwiches, coffee, lattes, and sooo much more.  All I had was a chocolate croissant, warmed up. But it was delicious and I will definitely be returning when in the area. Thank you Vince for the great service!",

I work on the strip and whenever I have a difficult day at work, I stop by and grab a big box of these on my way home. Never fails to brighten my day!   The coffee flavor is my favorite.  As I generally cant stand any bakery item or dessert that is coffee-flavored, this came as a surprise to me. I think it's because the espresso flavor is so rich and pairs well with the creaminess of the butter cream sandwiched in between the cookie layers. It's like the cookie version of a latte.   I wasn't particularly fond of the raspberry ones though. I prefer the fruit flavored macarons to have the jelly-like filling instead of the butter cream-like one. Despite that, Bouchon is still my favorite place to get macarons in Vegas!",

We also had the financier, a cinnamon roll, and cheese danish. All were delicious and memorable. Truly happy food :)  Pricing wasn't bad, considering the quality.

Even with a directory and asking folks who appeared to work at the hotel, it took a very, very long time. Pastry is your reward at the end of the line.    When faced with a case full of buttery, flakey, goodness - I froze. What should I get? It was all overwhelming. Suffice to say that I walked out of there with a box of macaroons and a rather large box full of goodies.   The macarons were packed well for travel so they went right into my carry-on bag. They were larger than what I typically see in Seattle. Win! They were also very well done with flavors that range from chocolate to pistachio to salted caramel. Kouign amann is at the top of my list since my friend introduced me to it years ago. This did not disappoint. A hard, sweet exterior surrounds buttery, velvety goodness inside. This is enough to ruin you forever! The croissants were very large and flakey. The pan au chocolate was very well done with the signature chocolate surrounded by croissant dough. Everything else is a blur. I'm fairly certain I bit everything in the box without regard to folks I was sharing with.   Overall, a very good bakery that's very hard to find. It wasn't busy when I was there because other people were hunting for it like I was.",

(I should've looked at their business hours) Luckily I was able to catch them when they were opened. I bought a box of macarons and they were delicious. Probably the best macarons I've had. They were big, crunchy, and chewy. I enjoyed every bite of it. They even have chocolate covered macarons! Of course I couldn't resist that, so I got a raspberry chocolate covered macaron. I highly recommend that when you come visit this bakery. There were other flavors like vanilla and caramel for the chocolate covered macarons. I wish I tried their other pastries though.  I definitely recommend this place when you visit Vegas! It's a really small bakery though and could easily be missed.",

On my departure day I was unexpectedly running late but MADE time to run by. Luckily no one was there at the time I arrived. So I asked the lady working the kiosk some questions about the croissants ,but she looked completely annoyed (first experience with bad service in Las Vegas) the I ordered two of the Oreo cookie sandwich things and asked her to box them because I would be taking them aboard my flight. When I got home that evening I excitedly opened the box to present the two Oreos to my two boys at home....and was horrified to see it was only 1.33 cookies!!! Ugh!",

My time came to order as I asked the gentleman did they have anymore sticky buns in the back. To which he said they no longer carry them.

Maybe my review isn't worth much since I don't have anything else to compare to, but my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed a box of macarons! We were just going to get 4, but the guy said when you buy 5 you get 1 free! And I'm a sucker for things like that... :)  Got 2 pistachio (because I read how fabulous they are), 1 chocolate, 1 raspberry, 1 espresso, and 1 vanilla bean. Pistachio was definitely our favorite. But they were all really really good. All of them had a light, fluffiness about them w/ that perfectly delicate outside. I loved that they were nice and puffy and none of them were too sweet. If I had to pick, vanilla was probably our least favorite, but that's only if someone made me pick. I was a bit sad when a couple of them broke because the box wasn't full and they were rolling around in the car (still in the box of course), but they were still yum. A couple of them seemed a tad dry, but I think that's also because it was a day later and we were in the car many hours (driving back home). Overall, I will DEFINITELY be coming back. :) :) :)",

According to her, this is just a small kiosk so there wouldn't be that much to try anyway. But, back to the macarons. In my limited experience as a macaron connoisseur, they have all been bite-sized - no bigger than the size of a half dollar coin. These macarons are supersized! They seem like a novelty item. The bigger size does not take away from the consistency of having a crispy shell with a soft and chewy inside. How do these compare with Paulette's, which have become the standard for good macarons? The texture is definitely there, but the flavors still go to Paulette's. The flavors are limited to: chocolate, raspberry, orange, lemon, espresso, and vanilla - good, but not amazing. Make me a giant almond-flavored macaron and you will get your 5th star. Oh, these macarons are not cheap by the way. One big MoonPie-sized macaron will cost you around $3.50. I still can't get over their humorously large size.",

    "text": "Shortly after landing in Vegas Friday morning I rushed over to the Venetian for a mid morning snack and cappuccino from Bouchon Bakery. The bakery was tricky to find but it was worth every step I took to get there.    The walk-up bakery has a great display of French-influenced baked goods. I was lucky to beat the mid-morning rush. Shortly after ordering the barista commented on how perfectly dry the cappuccino was. She handed me my drink and a precisely baked pain au chocolate, that had a golden brown and flaky exterior that was filled with warm, rich chocolate.   Not that I needed to, but I couldn't resist ordering something for the road. I chose a soft and chewy, buttercream filled, lemon macaron that turned out to be a delicious way to finish my snack.   Bouchon Bakery was a great way to start my Vegas weekend. I had perfect timing beating the rush; they had perfect service; a perfect cappuccino; and perfect baked goods. In no time after finishing my first few bites, a dozen or so people came charging in to experience the expertly crafted and enticing display of Bouchon's baked goods.",

This is Thomas Kellers bakery so there is some weight attached to the products.    Had the ham/cheese baguette and it was perfect, to nurse me back to a brighter shade of sobriety.  The bread with a slight crisp on the crust, a film of dijon mustard and just the right amount of meat and cheese made for a filling yet convenient snack to go on the run.  A little pricey @ almost $10, but it is split worthy, and you are at the Venetian and it is Thomas Keller, so what da f**k!     Also their cookies here are absolutely amazing as i'm sure the rest of their baked goods are.  The oatmeal cookie was probably the best i've ever had.  The perfect ratio of crisp to chew, just enough raisins to keep things interesting and that butter flavor, True butter flavor, not that artificial butter flavored shortening garbage.    They also do their version of a \"nutter butter\" cookie and if you're a fan of those peanut butter cookies then just times this version by 10. oh yea, it's that good.  No wait, \"good\" is not a good enough word to describe it, ...sublime, that's the ticket.",

Do you ever ask for directions, say yes and thank you, then a few minutes later, forget what that person just said? If you're in a huge casino with lots of shiny lights, loud noises, and lots of distractions, hey it happens.  So we finally find this tiny to-go bakery behind the escalators. I thought it was more of a sit-down cafe type of bakery. We peer into the glass case and everything looked so good. Then I saw the prices, especially for their french baguette sandwiches which looked like a skinnier version of Lee's sandwiches. It was $9.  We ended up getting a croissant and two macarons, all of which were huge in size at over $3 each. I know it's not a large sampling of what the bakery has to offer, but everything tasted just okay. For some reason, I thought the croissant would taste better than the ones from Costco (gasp!).   The macarons remind me of giant cookies, like the ones the Cookie Monster eats holding it in one hand. They were light, semi-chewy, and not overly sweet. I can't quite describe it, but the smaller sized macarons we had at Miette Patisserie in the SF Ferry Bldg tasted like it had more depth in flavors, if that's at all possible in a non-savory dessert pastry.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with this bakery. I'm a native of Las Vegas and rarely venture to the Strip. I first came upon the smaller of the bakeries and was told the main one was 1 floor below. First off, they weren't as friendly as the lady in the smaller bakery. I didn't find any plain almond croissants, only ones with a chocolate drizzle. When i inquired for plain ones, was curtly told he was sold out, so i asked for the ones with a drizzle. I next asked if i could customize the box of macarons, was told no. So i said i'd just get 4 pieces of macarons. When i get to the cashier i was told my bill was $28+. I wasn't thinking and just handed my card over. They never said thank you. Walking to the Palazzo, i realized it seemed too pricey, i opened my bag and realized that they put a box of macarons which i never ordered. I normally won't mind this but i was very disappointed and displeased with their service. I got home and tried their almond croissant with drizzle and was not impressed.  The pastry was not as flaky and a bit on the hard side. The macarons are not as swoon-worthy as i expected them to be, maybe the horrible customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. I would rather bring my business to Patisserie Manon and support local business.",

(BTW...You probably already know this but I heard from Darlene K that they opened one in LA...I looked it up and it is in Beverly Hills to be exact! Let's go next time you're up in town!!!)  I LOVED the macarons. They reminded me of the ones from Laduree - Paris... I think these come closer than even Boule's! They were perfectly chewy and moist on the inside with a delicate shell...bursting with flavor. I tried the lemon & coffee(?). I bought a box for a friend and she let me try the strawberry. (Very tasty although a few days later, they did dry out. The trick, I learned from her, is to put them in the freezer!).  The red velvet cupcake was a disappointment...too dry. Although I did like the filling in the middle which is like Black Bottom cupcakes. I also got the TKOs which were adorably shaped like snowmen for the holidays. They were so rich and chocolatey that you can only handle a single bite for a few hours until your taste buds settle down.  However, if I were to go back, I'd stick to the macarons. And maybe this bakery basket Jenny L. speaks of... : )",

I was dismayed that you didn't offer the almond croissants that your Yountville sister has in abundance, but your kind worker comforted me with a strawberry croissant with a light taste of almond paste. Too bad my buzz from Fat Tuesday prevented me from tasting it properly. But alas, it was this buzz that helped me shell out $4 for almost every baked goody I ordered.  The macarons were heavenly, and much bigger than those in Yountville. I fell in love with your $3.25 goodness. The chocolate chip cookie was a tad brittle, but the buttery fluffiness of the croissant and pain au raisin helped numb the pain in my teeth.   If only your prices were a tad lower (why is it cheaper in Yountville of all places?), I would love you forever.   Bouchon does wonders with butter.",

The pain was surprisingly light and flaky, not too buttery although I'm sure it's layered with butter.  The latte was good but  I recommend 2 shots to balance out the milk.  You also must try the fresh squeezed OJ. Unfortunately, it comes in large size only but I finished most of it, it was that good.  For these 3 things, my tab was around $18, I think.  It's pricey but everything is jacked up on the strip. I recommend the croissants, plain or chocolate.  I'm not a fan of the strawberry croissant.  It was mushy and too sweet (basically croissant topped with strawberry jam and dusting of powdered sugar).  I will not be ordering that again.   Btw, there is a killer espresso place right around the corner next to Crispy Creme.  Do NOT order the espresso at that Illy gelato place.",

I was staying in the Palazzo but Bouchon's was just a short 5 minute brisk walk away. I love the fact that the bakery, is just a simple and open store. It's not big and extravagent - just an open storefront you might see walking down the street in Europe. Once my friends and I got here, there were so many choices starting from breakfast items like croissants, breads to dessert like massive chocolate chip cookies, macaroons and dessert beignets!  I eventually ordered: * Almond brioche - it's almost like almond brittle baked on to a nicely toasted slice of brioche. Nice and buttery. * Chocolate chip cookie - A little too sweet for me but lots of butter :) * Assortment of macaroons - I got the box set which included every flavor - strawberry, orange, pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, espresso. The box set was $17.50 which is a steal when you do the math. Individual macaroons were $3.50 each. These macaroons weren't your normal sized macaroons either, they're about 3-4 times as big which makes me gladly hand over my money for these bites of delicious goodness. * Beignets - They come at $3.75 for two so I got both flavors that they had that day, raspberry and chocolate. The raspberry one was nice and sweet but was way overfilled with too much raspberry jelly - a little hard to eat. The chocolate one was heaven - rich chocolate ganache inside of a chocolate flavored beignet with chocolate sprinkles on top. Can it get any better than that?!  The macaroons were definitely the highlight of the bunch. They were sweet, crunchy, creamy and divine.  I'm coming here everytime I'm in Vegas to get some Macaroons and try a few more of their delectable pastries.",

You might wonder where the ovens are when you first witness this pretty standard-looking mall stand flogging high-end pastries. However, disappointment subsides when actually eating said pastries. Taken aback by the nearly four dollar asking price for their plain croissants, I chipped in an extra quarter for the almond version and did not regret it. My wife's ham sandwich was also quite good. The coffee wasn't great, but it was better than the strange brew that passes at most places around the Strip.

Love the presentation of the frosting garnished with pieces of chocolate.  It was about $3.50 for one and they put it in a cute little box.  The macarons were good, they were soft and chewy and not too sweet. I absolutely LOVE the red velvet cupcake!!! BEST EVER!!! It's not too sweet at all, just about the right amount of sweetness, and the vanilla bean cream cheese frosting is fantastic!! It spreads all over the top of the cupcake and through the core as well.

    "text": "The GF and I stayed at the Venetian in August for our anniversary and our elevators were right in front of the Bouchon Bakery! We decided to get a treat each day we were there.   On Sunday we decided to try the Red Velvet cupcake and it was really good! I thought for the price ($3.50) and the size of the cupcake it was a pretty good value. The frosting was really good, and I liked how there was a glob of frosting in the middle of the cupcake as well. If you are a frosting whore like me, you'll love it!   On Monday we decided to try the Fruit Tart, this was actually my favorite, but I am a huge Fruit Tart fan. It was topped with kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, peaches, and a fig! The fig was pretty tasty and unique. The custard was quite delicious and went well with the tasty crust. I have to admit I ate most of this one, sorry sweetie!   On Tuesday we had the Dark Chocolate Cupcake, this one was my GFs favorite, she loves dark chocolate so this one was all her. I thought it was good but I like milk chocolate better than the dark. This cupcake also had the glob of dark chocolate frosting in the middle of the cake.   So overall they were all good, I rank it Fruit Tart, Red Velvet,and Dark Chocolate. One funny note, my GF and I were thrown off my their plastic \"silverware\", the plastic forks/spoons/knives are silver and for a second we thought it was the real deal! If you have a sweet tooth, this is a must stop!",

It's like twice the size of a normal cupcake, but not as big as the Costco muffins. The best part? It cost only $3.50. What a deal! The actual cupcake was super moist and there was just a little frosting, not sure what it was, but after reading a couple of reviews, apparently it's marshmallow. It was just a light coating of it. To my surprise as I was getting towards the middle, there was the Valrhona chocolate mousse. What a pleasant surprise! I I wasn't expecting that, but I guess if I actually read the description that the bakery provided for their customers, I would have have expecting it, but all I say when I was looking in the bakery case was CUPCAKE! They didn't need to sell me with the mousse, even though it tasted better with it. Next time I come here, I will definitely get another cupcake, even if I'm not staying at the Venetian. It's worth the walk down the strip.",

The service was nice every time we were there. I think that the prices are fair for the product.  The Cons: The coffee is not good at all.

We had vanilla and pistachio macarons and some other small pastry.    Macarons were hard on the outside and the filling was cloying- they'd been sitting for too long, perhaps?  Big, which is nice, but ugh, CHEWY.  Not a word I want with my lighter than air cookies.  Two stars because I have hopes and I really did enjoy Bouchon.

The flavor is seriously lacking and it just wasn't up to par with what I've tried at other bakeries before. I bought the pre-packaged box with 6 macarons in it. The coffee/mocha flavored one was in-your-face strong and the chocolate is pretty decadent. The raspberry has a subtle flavor. I think the best one out of the box was the vanilla bean one. The caramel didn't taste like caramel and the pistachio one kind of had a soapy taste to it. Time to try my hand at making some myself!",

These macarons were probably the best I'd ever had in my lifetime. Each cookie was the right sweet, flavor distinct, slight crunch, and nice texture. I took very small bites to prolong the experience and hoping it wouldn't end. I could easily eat through the $20 worth. I also had the croissant, some cookie sandwich, and a turkey cran baguette. All were pretty good and made the experience great.  Also, bouchon bakery is probably the best spot to get coffee in the hotel. The ratio of girls to guys in line is 5 to 1. That's pretty good odds for Vegas.   uploaded pic -  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=3cSaRAN4ukyF0ch8BrAN7w#3cSaRAN4ukyF0ch8BrAN7w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_S...</a>",

The Brand Muffin was allegedly moist and tasty. AND IT WAS! A nice hearty surprise of gentle sweetness with enough ingredients to please the palate and stick to your ribs.  Realizing this may not be enough, I took the Cobb Salad with me. It too was flavorful and hearty and at $11, really not a bad deal at all.  Couldn't make the time to smell let alone take with me The Coffee -- which, in fairness, looks great.   In short, here's another great kiosk inside The Venetian. Sure it's a satellite of the nearby restaurant --- but when you don't have time, you could do an awful lot worse. (Did I mention the  Jerky?)",

They had a light sprinkling of powdered sugar on top and chocolate chips in the batter.

( the one above Walgreens)  My husband and i have been long time fans of bouchon bakery... so much that we have to stop by each time we leave.  our must gets are usually the ham and cheese croissant and ham and cheese sandwich / turkey sandwich.  This past weekend ( easter) , we stayed at the palazzo and walked to this tucked away location thinking we could beat the line.  we got there and were the only ones there ...so here we were thinking yay we scored.  The girl behind the counter did not greet us right away... not that it mattered if she was busy .. but she wasnt and when she did she was not very friendly.  I placed my order of the ham and cheese croissant and waiting for it to be heated up.  IN the meantime, my husband wanted to place an additional order but this girl was just ignoring him.  It took almost like 2 minutes before she asked if he needed some help or if he wanted to order.  yeah granted we came together, maybe that can be confusing, but i thought it was pretty obvious that he needed to place to order.  Anyways, after 2 minutes she finally acknowledged that we wanted more sandwiches.  Again she was not friendly, and almost borderline giving us an attitude. But we didnt say anything; we just stayed quiet and just waited patiently for our sandwiches.  At the other locations, the staff normally would put the whole sandwich in the panini press but this girl... she took the sandwich apart and then heated it .    it just seemed so different ... but the main reason for this review was b/c both my husband and i got food poisoning from these sandwiches we got .  I dont know if its b/c of the location - that they may not get the most fresh items or if the assembly of these sandwiches went wrong.    but for now .. im definitely staying away from bouchon.   some may say .. maybe its something else we ate or drank that day ... but to make it simple, those sandwiches were the only thing we ate that day before we headed back home and water was the only thing we drank ( bottled).      we are soo disappointed.",

There's no secret, macaroons are just simply heavenly and to die for but these were probably the best I've ever had, no lie.  The filling was a little more buttery which I loved because it contrasted with the sweet crispy cookie perfectly. I splurged and bought 2 gift boxes, one of the mini's and one regular sized. At first glance, the prices may shock you but for the size of the cookie and quality in taste, it's well worth it.  I didn't actually get to eat most of them until I got home since I was stuffing my face with everything else on the strip haha. Scared that the cookies would lose the crispiness, I literally scarfed down my macaroons in a few days. I was surprised though on the fourth day, the cookies were nearly fresh still. From experience, I haven't had any macaroons stay edible for more than one or two days (if they weren't eaten yet!).  Next time I will try the cupcakes and such and hopefully not stop by on a full tummy. Be back in a few months maybe??..",

The cream wasn't too sweet and the cookie part was soft and not dry.  It's too bad that the pastry chef leader or team weren't there at the kiosk at the Venetian where I got these because I'd give each person a high-five for making such damn good macarons!

Just the right amount of subtle chewiness combined with light flaky crispiness  I recommend buying a box of their mini macarons (they're actually the same size as regular macarons you would find anywhere else) for $12 (which comes out to $2 per macaron); then, you can try them all and determine which one you like the most before you buy the bigger individual ones for $3.50 each.  I wish they had more flavors.  They have a total of six flavors: vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, raspberry, coffee and caramel.  My favorite flavors were vanilla and raspberry.  The chocolate and coffee macarons were too rich for me.    Pistachio and caramel were descent.  Definitely check this place out when you're at The Venetian!",

Cookies are good fare but not \"the bomb.\"  Also, the vegetable bread lacked some taste.  Stick with the ciabatta with goat cheese on top.  Ham and cheese sandwiches are pricy but yummy.

    "text": "Seriously? Really? You gotta be joking!  Those were some of my replies when I asked people about the sandwiches and pastries served here when they told how good, and what an orgasmic experience it was to eat stuff here. Well, shit, call me a lemming, but I had to try it out for myself.  I came here to eat a light lunch, and after looking at the size of the sandwiches, it was an ultra light lunch. For that size, being $11, it better be the best fucking sandwich I've ever had in my life. Sadly, totally not the case.  I ordered the turkey and cheese (brie) on a focaccia bread (toasted) and it was really OK. I mean for such a famous place, and supposedly great bread, I wasn't WOWed by it. The sandwich overall was not bad, I mean the brie really meshed well with the turkey and the turkey was flavorful. I guess I was expecting a lot from this place, and I left slightly disappointed. Now, I was told the Macaroons are amazing here, but I think next time, I'll take a pass and eat something else. Honestly, I'm just not a fan and I would have been just as happy with a sandwich from Johnny Rocket down in the food court.",

I'll just review the macarons, since the other stuff was good, but nothing special. They are 3.50 a piece, but are a lot bigger than the average macaron.  The cookie part is utter perfection, a nice outer shell with chewiness when you bite into it. The filling however, was too soft and buttery for me, especially the pistachio. I prefer my fillings to be a lot more thick and rich. My favorite was the caramel, didn't care for the chocolate at all. I'm glad to have tried it, but don't know if I would go back again - maybe if I stopped by and saw that they had a bigger selection, like more savory items.",

Everyone comes here for the macarons which for someone who's never had a macaroon or 'ron before im not quite sure to compare it too but it was light, delicate and tasty! got the 5 'ron special or something like that so i could try all the flavors its too bad I cant really define what each one is although some are fairly simple to distinguish, the pink one is strawberry and yes it tastes like strawberry. Pistachio was good and i think the tan was caramel or coffee, but whatever it is, i did like it! What i thought was better than the macarons was the TKOs! I'm an oreo eater so this really made my day! it wasnt in the glass when i ordered so i asked the clerk and she said they just made some so i got a fresh batch! yum! real good, taste like a luxurious creamy oreo..what can i say, i like my oreos... all in all the TKO was a definite TKO!",

The most memorable items are the French macaroons. They are larger and flatter than macaroons from other places. I had to resist myself and only get two, raspberry and pistachio. The raspberry was delicious, but a little on the sweet end. The pistachio was nutty and more True to a real pistachio flavor than most macaroons.   The apple croissant was flaky on the outside and full of apples and crumbs on the inside.   Bouchon: These were a lot smaller than I had expected and more like a brownie than a fluffy cake that I expected. The \"brownie\" was very rich and delicious!

After seeing the good reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try. $17.50 or so for a box of about 6? A bit pricey, but what isn't in Vegas?   Out of all the flavors, I liked only the espresso one. It had a good amount of coffee taste to it, but not overwhelming. The filling used for these macarons are not overly sweet which tends to be the case with most places. But basically, all the other flavors with the exception of chocolate and espresso basically tasted to same to me. And maybe it was a bad batch, but out of the 6, I think half of them were hollow in the middle. Which is not how a properly made macaron should be.   The girl that helped us was a bit slow? But maybe it's been a long day.   Overall, they're alright. Not the best I've ever had. But if you must try something, I would definitely go for the espresso.",

Although this particular day didn't seem to be a busy day for the hotel, we found Bouchon extremely busy. Hmm, that would normally indicate a top notch restaurant, eh?  Our wait?  It was about 45-50 minutes,,, so naturally I was expecting some really top notch food to be coming. In fact, I was really counting on having some gourmet waffles this particular morning! Well, would you believe it, this place actually ran out of waffles!!! How do you run out of waffles? Sure, perhaps a restaurant could run out of frozen Lego waffles, but I would expect THIS restaurant to be making their own fresh waffles- which you should NEVER run out of!  Unbelievable... it's just flour, eggs, sugar, milk... not much required!  I got no excuses, just \"we're out\".  Okaaaay... well, after I got over the fact they ran out of waffles, I ordered some really basic pouched eggs (which I expected to arrive in front of me tout de suite).  Nope, I was once again extremely disappointed!!!  Delivery of our basic food order was incredibly slow - making our whole experience at Bouchon a huge time waster during an otherwise beautiful morning.  Solution?  Well, for the rest of our stay at the Venetian we boycotted Bouchon and had some great fast and delicious breakfast meals at the Food Court... which is the place to go if you don't want the hassles you might be subjected to at Bouchon.  Perhaps the test is to ask how long your wait will be at Bouchon and then judge... good luck! :)",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to be staying in the Venetian for 3 nights and would pass this little  Bouchon satellite bakery every time I went up and down the elevators to my room. I had read the Yelp reviews regarding Bouchon's macaroons so I figured I better give them a try.  Picked up 2 lattes (good, not extraordinary), croissant breakfast sandwiches (ham was cold despite being put into the panini maker, but the croissant was DELICIOUS), and 2 macaroons. Let me preface this by stating that I have never thought a macaroon was anything special. In fact, I usually take a bite and hand it off.  But Bouchon's macaroons are really something special! Let's just say that I made quite a few additional stops to the bakery during my stay and tried every flavor and a few of them twice! I wish I brought a box of them home with me but it's probably a good thing for my health that I didn't.",

    "text": "This bakery stand is located in front of the Phantom Theater in the Venetian, and close to the Grand Lux Cafe. This place is great for to-go baked treats (cookies, croissants, muffins, etc) and coffee; there are no tables to sit at and eat. They had very limited healthy breakfast options, just oatmeal and yogurt with granola. I had the mango yogurt with granola ($6; yummy crunchy and nutty), my man had the ham & cheese sandwich on a French baguette (tasty but not worth the $9 price tag!). The TKO cookies (I'm assuming that stands for Thomas Keller Oreos) are a fresh, refined version of the classic; so buttery and creamy that the supermarket version will seem like cardboard to me from this day forward.  The macarons were amazing! Yes, slightly better than Paulette's because they were more contrast in texture (super crunchy exterior and creamy center) and I loved how big they are. We tried their gift pack of 6 flavors (chocolate, vanilla, coffee, pumpkin, strawberry, and pistachio). My favorite was chocolate & coffee, my man loved the pumpkin.   Thomas Keller-- if you're reading this, can you please open up a bakery in San Francisco??? :)",

We were very disappointed as everything we tried was very ordinary.    Tried the coffee macaron and chocolated dipped pistachio macaron. Good coffee flavor butno pistachio flavor.  Pistachio one actually reminded me of a chocolate dipped mint oreo cookie.  Regardless, both too sweet. Strawberry croissant tasted like a strawberry Entenmann's coffee cake.  No kidding.  Carrot cake sandwich thing unmemorable and lacking in flavor.  Nutter Better cookie sandwich also forgettable and a bit on the overly sweet side.  Cheese danish was the most likeable of the items we got but also unimpressive.  The only reason it stood out in any way was the excellent cream cheese frosting on top.   Overall, skip it.",

As DIFFICULT as this is, however, I have decided to restrain myself. I plan on trying their assortment in moderation. That can only mean more Vegas trips for me, woohoo!  Thus far, I've tried their red velvet cupcake, a vanilla macaron, and of course, a few TKOs. Red velvet cupcake was good, but not the best I've had. The vanilla macaron, however, is one of the best I've had. They have the textures down nicely and a well-thought out balance of flavor. Not too subtle or overpowering. JUST right, which I can appreciate.  As for the TKO, I can tell you the exact setting of where I was when I last bit into one. The memory will stay with me forever. I had to stop walking in order to savor the moment. *pauses to think back...* Anyways, the filling cream inside is a soft pillow of sweetness that melds perfectly with the decadent, chocolate cookie. It's a definite must-try.  As for the coffee, it's good. Too sweet for my taste, but it's not bad. Nothing out of this world either. It won't hurt as an accompaniment to the delectable pastries in store for you here though!",

This place is great for those who want to grab a delicious baked good with the comfort of knowing it comes from the same pedigree as the Bouchon restaurant just a few floors above.  With clear glass cases showcasing the beauties behind the invisible cage, it displays baked delicacies with as much sensual gluttony as you'd expect from a city with the word \"sin\" added in its alias. Everything is enormous, from their macaroons to their, dense, filling bread pudding. Mix it in with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate and you have a perfect pair.  Though the pricing is a bit expensive, with even the macaroons hovering at $3 each, your wallet might not appreciate you going on a spending spree in this one area; however, if you do decide to splurge, at least you know this is one bet you're not gambling on.",

It went like this...\"wow...ahhhh...ummmm....wow....awesome....etc\" and it went like that for the next 15 minutes because that's how long it takes to finish just one macaron.  They're $3.50 per macaron, but they are more than 3 times the size of a standard sized macaron. It pretty much fits right into the palm of your hand. So you get the quantity as well. But the quality far exceeds every other macaron I've ever had including the ones in Paris.  Bouchon, you have won me over. C'est la vie. My first one was the pistachio and it was phenomenal. The flavors just kept coming and coming. It was non-stop. Whatever they did to these macarons, I just had to buy more.  So I got the 6-pack as well. For $17.50, you definitely save a lot more instead of just buying one and you get one of each flavor available. I got everyone in the group onboard with my macaron frenzy and they too enjoyed and devoured their piece. Me on the other hand, wanted to savor this 6-pack at home and I regret not buying another box.  The 6-pack includes the raspberry, chocolate, lemon, pistachio, cinnamon and coffee. I'm not going to make another essay out of my macaron review, but essentially all of them were of the 5-star quality. No bullshit here.   I also got one of the giant chocolate cookies, $3.50. Again, savor this one, because this one is rich, full of buttery chocolate flavor.  They have a few other Bouchon's out there including one up in the Napa Valley area. NV, you are now on my bucket list for a future visit and some more macarons. And yah, next Vegas trip will involve another visit to the Bouchon. Good job on giving me the best macarons in the universe.",

They seem to be pretty popular as I've encountered a line each time, but it moves fast. I've tried a bunch of their baked good like cupcakes, chocolate croissants, danish, scones, sticky buns, beignets, cookies etc over my visits. All their products are fresh and taste great specially the sticky buns which are loaded with pecans and have a coating of caramelized sugar which balances the taste of the pecans very well still they tend to be on the sweet side. The cream danish on the other hand has only a mildly sweet filling that will appeal to people who don't want their deserts too sweet. Prices for most items are around the $4 mark which is in-lines with what you pay at other bakeries on the strip.",

Vanilla was more of a vanilla bean super light, chewy, fluffy and just delicious! Raspberry was ok, it wasn't as good as the vanilla, the coloring on the cookie was half faded so I don't know if it was the light in the case that caused it, or it was a little less than fresh. I probably should have stuck with the coffee flavored one.  Chocolate was fabulous, rich flavor, melt in your mouth macaroon cookie goodness.   I also purchased a blueberry muffin around $4. It Had a crumb topping with powdered sugar. Muffin tasted like a muffin, not too dense or cakey. Lots of luscious blueberries inside, definitely not lacking.  I waited to indulge on these goodies until my last day in Vegas. I anticipated them to be delicious, and they were.  So they were a nice end to my vacation.

I was unprepared, shocked, excited!  I knew that I wanted to try the macaroons. At the $3.50 a pop, I could only justify getting one. I settled on my favorite flavor, pistachio, and ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well.   The macaroon was overly sweet. To me it tasted like an Andes mint flavored macaroon, so maybe they use mint for color? There was only a subtle hint of pistachio. I was completely disappointed. The macaroons in the freezer section at Walmart are 10 times better.  The chocolate chip cookie was okay. The chocolate chips were fantastic, but the cookie was just average. Definitely not something I'd go back for.  If you're on the Strip, there are far better options that are more deserving of your money and caloric intake. Skip this one!",

I eat Macarons all over the United States, and a normal macaron is room temp, not chewy, and usually has a nice soft texture to it.  Avoid this Macaron at all costs.

Their larger then usual and chewy-yumm, BUT it could use more filling for the price you pay. I LOVE me some oreos and the TKO didn't do it for me. Honestly, I didn't even finish it. The verdict, this place is over hyped. I'm sure the renowned Thomas Keller & the fact that it is inside the Venetian make people up the star power and suddenly their palates taste the quality (I'm not hatin', I'm simply observing from my experience & giving my opinion).  NONETHELESS, I like the place! I'll definitely be back but I already know of bakeries in my own area that have cheaper and comparable macarons and pastries.",

    "text": "Extremely hard to find.  It's located under an escalator at a dead-end area of the casino.  Unless you walk all the way to the front door of the Venetian theater and turn around (it'll be behind you) then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it (like I did.)  Another reviewer said it's near Lux Cafe...not really.  It's a good bit away from it. The casino signs for it stop when you're still too far away to find it, and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it.  I asked two - one sent me to the Lux Cafe bakery; the other tried to send me to the restaurant, which is located on another floor.  Fairly pricy.  Service was average; staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it.  They got my order wrong, but fortunately I checked my bag, and they did fix it when I asked.  But the biggest reason for 2 stars: Seriously underwhelming pastry.  I ordered a macaron, TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo), a bouchon, a croissant, and a mini almond loaf, and coffee. The only things I would have ordered again are the coffee (not exceptional but good) and the almond loaf, which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh.  The TKO was decent but too sweet - that white chocolate ganache didn't blow me away.  I'm pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the TKO was not baked that same day.  I went around 11 AM; perhaps things are better/fresher earlier?",

Lines during each visit were super long. Understandable if due to popularity/demand; however, the people working there were not the most efficient. We saw some employees goofing off and ignoring customers despite a long line. I am all about having fun with your coworkers, but it's annoying when you've been waiting in line for a while. They also forgot to give my friend her macaron that she ordered at the same time as her latte. My latte was just alright - lacked great flavor and too much foam.  Very small selection of items. Bakery items are the same quality that I've enjoyed over the years.  Would go here as a matter of convenience, but would definitely go to the casino/strip location for a larger selection.",

    "text": "This small French dessert kiosk is located behind the escalator on the casino floor of the Venetian. The obscured location might be difficult to find, but somehow we always managed to stumble upon it. Without a seating area, the line alongside the large pastry counter may be long, but it usually gives us just enough time to make the right choices.   My favorite item was the PBC ($4.25). It came with a layer of salted peanut butter with a ring of chocolate, sandwiched in-between two thick cookies filled with bits and pieces of peanuts and chocolates embedded here and there. The centrality of the sweet and salty peanut flavor nicely intermingled with the dark semi-sweet chocolate. The cookies were firm with a nice crisp and crumbly texture. I am a big fan of peanut butter, and together, this sandwich cookie was a winner.  I also enjoyed the palm size French Macarons ($3.50) and would highly recommend them. One of Santi's favorites, the Pistachio Macaron was semi-sweet, and carried a refined, natural pistachio flavor. The outer texture was crisp, egg shell-like, and delicate, followed by an air pocket before reaching the base of the shells and its creamy filling. Together, the macaron had a good chew, but the base of the shell was a bit stiff and thicker than necessary.   Comparatively, I had better results with the Salted Caramel Macaron. Well balanced, the refined caramel flavor was sensational along with a slight hint of salt in the background. The all-around contrasting textures of this macaron were also more consistent with my expectations. I would love to get the Salted Caramel Macaron again, but I'm also looking forward to trying the other seasonal flavors.  The Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($3.25) was not the best, but still highly addictive. This massive cookie was firm, crispy, and fully loaded with semi-sweet chocolate in every bite. I wished the crispy buttery cookie had a softer chew, but the thick crumbly texture did not deter me from eating it all in one setting. I would have enjoyed this cookie more if it could be served warm.   The item I did not fully enjoy was the Pain au Chocolat ($4). The crisp, ultra flaky, airy and soft textures were impressive, and nicely accompanied by a hint of salt and buttery flavor. However, there were only two tiny strips of chocolate embedded at the bottom of the croissant. To date, Amandine Patisserie still has my favorite Pain au Chocolat.  I also do not recommend the Cinnamon Roll ($4). The layers were too dense, stiff, and cake-like without the yeasty airy dimensions to render that soft gooey cinnamon wow factor.  The TLC ($3.25) made with pecan, cinnamon, and rolled oats had a one-dimensional earthy flavor without some other ingredients to complicate the overall profile. I tried, but did not finish the cookie.  Overall, their desserts were more buttery than sugary, with impressive level of balance in the flavors and textures across each ingredient. It wasn't necessarily a refined experience in every bite, but there was still plenty to like about their pastries and desserts. Service was to the point and prompt on each of our visits. I hope to return soon to try their Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Kouign-Amann, Thomas Keller Oreo, and Seasonal Eclairs and Tarts.",

I was heading to Treasure Island so I took the elevator next to Bouchon and found they had another bakery counter upstairs with no line.  Anyways, I love love love their macarons.  So far it's a tie between the pistachio and salted caramel. They are a little pricey ($5 each) but they're about 2.5x the size of a normal macaron and they're just amazing.  My second favorite thing to get here is a vanilla chai latte, goes perfect with a macaron :D. Coffee prices are comparable to starbucks.  Sad to say I actually haven't tried anything else here. I really have only been able to come here while taking a long walk on the strip. Again, sad to say I don't ever stay the Venetian hotel where it would be much more convenient.",

The tart was very good and just what I'd expect from Bouchon.  The only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit.  It is almost entirely takeout.  The tart was boxed which wasn't necessary.  I ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart.  I soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that.  There's a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugars/creams for coffee, but it wasn't working.  After finishing, I went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.  A great little pastry and a perfect end to a dinner somewhere else!",

    "text": "How is possible with a French name Bouchon have such a terrible croissant..??! Should have believed  the Yelper who wrote that the pastries were staled and the bakery wasn't good. We bought two croissants at 10:45am, one was almond the other was apple. Those were probably the worst croissants we ever had. They were so dry that they were coming apart like a crumbling cookie. That's just unacceptable for the name and the location. We didn't complain and didn't return them but probably should have... one bite and in the trash they go.  Should have gone back to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria which had better selection and top of the line pastries.  This review is for the bakery only.  I'm sure the restaurant is a lot better.... I hope.",

We went in the early afternoon and did not feel like there was a huge selection to choose from. The kougin amann was my favorite out of the 3 pastries. It was dense, flakey, with that caramelized exterior I love. The chocolate almond croissant was more dense than any almond croissant I've had experience with but my boyfriend said this is how a proper almond croissant should be so be prepared for something a little different. There were 3 flavors available for the macarons. The pistachio had good flavor and a slightly chewy texture with a light crispy exterior. These macarons are on the large end but they were baked perfectly. The pastries here are certainly a step above your standard French bakery and if you love pastries this is a must eat while in Vegas!",

    "text": "So there are a few Bouchon locations around the Venetian. The restaurant is located next to guest registrations (where you check in)... There's a counter under the escalators coming from the parking garage to the casino floor, next to the elevators going to the hotel room... And little shops at street level in from of Venetian, and close to the the skybridge leading to TI.   I visit the counter by the guest elevators (a few times).   There's several employees behind the counter. Service was okay, but a bit rushed, even when there wasn't much of a line.   Oatmeal cookie- large. Full of flavor. So so chewy. I bought it and ended up not eating it until 2 days later, still so fresh tasting.  Granola bar- sweet and chewy. Also really good.   Chocolate almond croissant- so crisp and flaky on the outside... But soft, moist, and buttery inside. Just enough chocolate bits and a nice amount of almond spread. Just a bit messy to eat!   Macarons- I got one of each flavor. Again I didn't eat right away, instead, I took it home and stored it in the fridge. Next day, the macarons still tasted very fresh. Delicate cookie, soft, and chewy. The vanilla and chocolate ones were very sweet and rich. The flavors were kinda plain actually... The PB&J macaron tasted a bit like the chocolate one, but with jelly/jam in it.. The size of hockey pucks, just one is enough to satisfy any sweet craving you might be having. I'm hopeful that the pistachio one I have left at home has a flavor I'm more excited about..  Overall, I loved Bouchon and will definitely come back to try some of their other items next time I'm in town... Everything had a fresh taste and with quality ingredients.",

I heard there was a bouchon here and thought I'd try it. I also heard they have good macarons so thought I'd give that a go as well.  If you like really good croissants, don't get there's. Honestly, it tasted like a day old croissant from Costco. Not that there isn't a place for those, but it isn't at an extremely reputable patisserie.   More disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron. It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I can't decide whether I should finish eating it or not.  If you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldn't be crunchy at all, not hard, but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it.  This macaron, again, tastes a day old, it's hard,crunchy, and too cold.   If you haven't had a macaron before, don't have this one or else you'll think macarons themselves are disappointing. The flavor is ok, however.   Verdict: if you like real authentic croissants and macarons, dont come here.   Tant pis...",

I stayed at the Palazzo this time and was so excited that Bouchon was a short walk away from me!  Bouchon for breakfast every day!  I only managed to take a picture of my almond croissant because I would devour everything else I bought without thinking.  Also, because I was hungry.  On this trip I got almond croissants, a chocolate chip cookie and a breakfast sandwich.  YES, everything was amazing.  I've also tried their macarons in the past.  Their macarons are huge.  To me, their macarons are the next best ones after Laduree. That's saying a lot!  Their breakfast sandwich is cheese, an egg and bacon in a croissant.  They warm it up for you and the croissant becomes this soft flaky heaven.  This sandwich is also huge by the way.  I'm sad I couldn't finish it.  Their chocolate chip cookie is wonderfully soft.  So soft, it stayed almost it's natural state 3 days later in the bag in my hotel lol. I couldn't eat it all at once but still tasted great the third day.  I got the almond croissant almost daily to have some sort of carb readily available in my room.  So good.  Still not as good as Nadege's almond croissants but these are probably the next best thing.  Service at Bouchon is always so friendly and upbeat.  Makes our mornings all the more pleasant.",

The Macarons here are much bigger in size, the outside is crispy and the inside is soft and chewy. As far as price I can't compare because I've only had Laduree once, but I think the prices for the Bouchon Macarons are fair because they are bigger and not the dainty little ones.   We've also had the muffins and some other fruity pastries from here as well and they were equally as yummy, but those Macarons though :)  Overall: this is a great spot to pick up some pastries (they also have pre-made sandwiches and salad) for a quick snack. Not only that but they prices won't kill you like at other places on the strip",

I was actually hoping to try Thomas Keller's variation on the Oreo, but they were completely sold out, so I instead went with the old standby of an almond croissant.  It certainly looked the part; it was covered in almond slivers and dusted with icing sugar. But one bite let me know that things had gone very, very awry somewhere along the line.  Basically, the thing was hard as a rock. I couldn't even bite through it with my front teeth. I had to break off a piece and gnaw on it with my molars. Not exactly what you're looking for in a croissant.  The middle section was a little better, as underneath the rock-hard exterior was a filling that was pretty tasty. But getting there required a Herculean feat of chewing.",

It was just as regular as it was in the case and there was nothing special look or taste wise about it. The bread was too thick for the amount of cheese that's on the sandwich.",

Their macaroons are huge, compared to a traditional  macaroon. Was about the size of my palm. And only cost $3.50, I got the coffee macaroon, I found it to be flavorful, and the right amount of chewy, crispness, and just perfectly executed! Was it a comeback dessert for me, No. Will I pay another visit to BB@V, proabaly not! Just not enough selection for me, so thats why i'm only giving three stars, it was just okay for me",

I like them more crispy like a toasted croissant, and this one had some caramelized almost creme-brulee'd bottom. Would eat again. And again.

We would love to try every single thing available but we knew that we couldn't do it so we settled with a chocolate almond croissant and a strawberry lemonade macaron. Omg they were delicious. Some of the best desserts we had in Vegas. They were so yummy that we came back and bought some macarons and croissants to bring home.   We would love to come back to this place again for more tempting sweets the next time we are in Vegas.",

So it must have been fate that I would end up next to it the moment I was also leaving Vegas. I was confused at first if it was the actual Bouchon bakery because I was expecting it to be in a typical bakery store setting. This little bakery is located right next to the elevators that take you to self parking in the Venetian Hotel. Who would have known right? I must have walked by it a dozen times without realizing it was the actual Bouchon.   Seeing that I hadn't had breakfast yet, I eyed all the croissant, but ended up choosing the chcolate almond croissant. Two of my favorites combined into one flaky sweet pastry. It had both the almond and chocolate filling inside. So good!!!  I also ordered 2 macarons- sea salt caramel and their seasonal earl grey. They were huge! Crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. These were definitely tasty treats to have for the plane ride back home.",

I tried every flavor they had available. Maybe it's the texture that I don't like. I expected something that was more crunchy or crispy. It just felt like chewed gum in my mouth.   I am not saying that macaroons are bad in general, I'm just saying that they are not for me. My favorite was the chocolate one however. It tasted like a brownie.   I wished I tried the other desserts. The red velvet cupcake was huge (twice the size of a regular cupcake) and it cost almost as much as one macaroon.",

Located right outside the elevators to the hotel tower and just opposite to the phantom theater, this is the best place to grab breakfast pastries and dessert.   Bouchon Bakery is known for their French Macarons. Come here early if you want the freshest and puffiest cookie of love. Unlike many macaron shops, Bouchon only offers half a dozen flavors at a time. I often find their regular flavors better than their seasonal ones. Cafe, Chocolate, Vanilla  and Pistachio were all very consistent among different locations.  Nothing makes me happier than having a sticky bun for breakfast. I like their version here more than the one from the famous Flour Bakery in Boston. It is lighter but puffier and perfectly layered with nutty pecans. Do come here early for the best selection. Popular pastries tend to sell out quick.",

Bouchon Bakery is a short walk away and is accessible from the strip side of the Venetian as well as from inside.   I wanted coffee as I was walking along the strip, but as expected, a latte will run you $5. I gave up on that. When I got to Bouchon, I wanted a macaron (just one since they're probably the equivalent of 2.5 regular macarons) and something to drink. Ok, under $3 for an iced tea, woohoo; funny how I consider that a win...oh Vegas strip...  I was STOKED that they had a pumpkin macaron, perfect for fall and winter! Unfortunately, it got smushed in my bag before I found a spot to sit and gobble it. The foodie IGer in me was upset, but I devoured the macaron and forgot all about it. Bouchon macarons don't disappoint; they're a bit too sweet for my palate, but that's why I got the iced tea. I also saw that they had the Oh-Oh (Thomas Keller's version of the Ho-Ho) and the TK Oreo at this location, woot! Yup, this is definitely going to be a regular stop for me when I'm in Vegas since I end up in Vegas more often than Napa, haha.",

Yeah not sure why she didnt tell me that the bakery was just downstairs....   Anyways i had tried the chocolate almond croissant and the pecan cinnamon roll when we had breakfast at the restaurant which was really good but pretty expensive.... typical Vegas... The pecan roll was just okay but the chocolate almond croissant, i fell in love with. I proceeded to get one every day we were there after that.... yeah its that good. I really wanted to try a macaron, but i like the very clever, atypical flavors. They only offer the very standard vanilla and chocolate kind of flavors, so i opted to pass.",

I came here on Saturday morning and got the carrot cake cookie and two macaroons: pistachio and salted caramel. The carrot cake cookie was great. The macaroons were some of the best I have ever had. They were very large compared to macaroons I have had in the past, but the best part was the creme filling. It was very buttery.   I also ordered coffee and the coffee was very good too.",

The lines were not long, and everything in the display case looked mouthwatering!  I wanted my niece to try this place because she loves macarons.  She got a 6-pack of macarons.  raspberry, pistachio, strawberry lemonade, coffee, vanilla bean, and salted caramel.  The coffee and the pistachio were the best tasting flavors.  The others were good, but not as good.  We did try a few other baked goods here, but I cannot recall the exact names of them anymore.  I do remember that they all tasted quite good though.  Surprisingly, the prices were very reasonable as well.  We will, definitely, make Bouchon Bakery a must visit stop for us whenever we're at the Venetian.",

    "text": "This is a review of their small, to-go locations. There's one upstairs and one downstairs, really close to each other in the Venetian. There is no seating, but there is a shared seating area upstairs. Selection is slightly different at each one. The manager works downstairs, so if you have a 25% off coupon from the Bouchon restaurant, you need to go there to use it. There wasn't a line the times we went. I bought a pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant shaped into a rectangular roll) for breakfast. It was flaky and delicious, however, it needed more chocolate! There were only a few chips...disappointing. However, the other baked goods I got to take home were excellent. First up was a strawberry cupcake. It was gorgeously made and topped with a small chocolate disk. This one tasted like it had buttermilk in the batter. It was moist and ever-so-slightly tangy. Really excellent paired with the strawberry cream. As good as the ones I make! ;) Then, I got 4 different flavors of macarons. The vanilla one was fine, as expected. The chocolate caramel was the favorite. Rich caramel flavors in the filling. Delicious! Strawberry and chocolate were good also. The macarons are about 1/3 larger than the usual. They have a perfect crunchy exterior, the frilly \"feet\" that are mandatory for macarons, and the right amount of creamy filling. The texture is slightly chewy at room temperature. If you do refrigerate them, make sure they come up to room temp before serving. Overall, expensive, but worth it. Can't go wrong with the cupcakes and macarons.",

I'd read many reviews and looked over a lot of pics and got excited to try something sweet. The treats we bought did not live up to the expectations.   We each got a macaron and croissant. The macaron tasted like it was stale. Like, the taste something gets when it's left in the fridge for too long and is an absorbent type food. I got the apple croissant and thought it was way too dry. My sister had the chocolate croissant and thought the same thing.   It was kind of a pain to get to, so this is a spot I'll not waste time on next time I'm in town.",

I wasn't expecting Animal Farm, but still.  The line was also pretty disorganized, and they ended up charging us for a box of macarons (and giving us the box of macarons) in our large order when we never actually asked for it.  When we brought it to their attention, they took it off, but it took multiple attempts to place orders for them to get our stuff right.",

After waiting in line for a good 10 mins, the girl informed me they don't take room key cards...FML I mutter. One star down.   I tell her \"no worries\", I'll run upstairs and grab my wallet and be right back down. By the time everything is ready I'll be right here. I ordered a large latte and a chocolate almond croissant.  I go upstairs, get my wallet, make it all the way back down and MUCH to my DISMAY she never submitted my order. I guess she needed to wait for me to come back. Minus another star...that's just bad customer service. Here's an idea...why don't you have signs that clearly say you don't take room keys to \"charge it to the room\" before people actually get in line?  So now I have to wait, I'm hungover, sleepy, pissed, and impatient...not what you would call a \"happy camper\" and this has been a really shittie experience so far.   I finally get my items and travel upstairs to my room.  The croissant was drier than dry, it was quite awful really. IF it wasn't such a pain in the you know what I would've gone all the way downstairs to return it...it was THAT BAD. It was so dry that it actually broke apart into sawdust and went everywhere, like a vampire that just got staked. I even tried to flick it to see if it would disintegrate into a bunch of little pieces and it did.  No Bueno   I won't return and I would rec'd you head over to the food court for coffee.   Really a disappointing experience all around.",

    "text": "Most people know the Bouchon Bakery kiosk by the Venetian theater and Grand Luxe Cafe, but there is actually three satellites within the Venetian. This one is located under the clock tower and apparently there is a third in the sports book I haven't been to.   So if you are outside, it is to the left of the gondolas right under the 2nd floor bridge from across the street so it's probably easiest to get to if you aren't staying here and walking the strip. This has outdoor seating, if you want to soak up the sun. From inside, go towards the Poker Room and follow it  to the right to a hallway going out and you'll see it.   These will have the same treats as the original one, but this seems to have less traffic. I happen to pass by the theater one afterward and there was many things that were out that I did see at this one. If you're looking for a specific treat, call all three and see which one has it. I didn't get too much on this visit, I just wanted macarons. If you buy 5 of them, you get 1 free ($3.50 each) which fills their gift box perfectly if you are gifting these to someone.   They were pretty friendly in here answering my questions about various things. Will be back, of course! Bouchon has been one of my favorite bakeries for years.",

When I went last time, my cupcake was overly sweet that I could only eat a couple bites, the macarons lacked a crispy shell and tasted more like whoopie pies, and my cookie was a little too hard. Overall the baked goods at this location do not taste very fresh. It's always crowded too so the staff isn't very friendly and rushes people in line.",

If they have any left... their cheesecake is the best, comes in a cute little individual sized cup-- super creamy and not the baked kind. Stop by for a little sweet-- they have croissants, peanut brittle, macarons (yummy and a great selection!), their signature bouchon brownies and madelines among others.   Prices weren't too bad if you don't get a macaron, they had HUGE cupcakes for only $3.50-- really, compared to some places that i've seen this is quite a steal. The were seriously HUGE!  Macarons were about $4.00 each I think!",

We ended up going to Bouchon twice during our one-week stay on the strip. Both times we got a box of six macarons, and we ended up trying every flavor. The pistachio is the best! Followed by raspberry and caramel. The size and quality are totally worth the price, and the service was great as well.     Pick up a box and take them back to your room for breakfast the next day...they get a little bit dinged up during travel, but are still just as yummy the next morning (if you can even wait that long to eat them! They make a great late night snack as well).   They had an assortment of other pastries and baked goods, but the only things I tried were the macarons and the Nutter Butter sandwich cookie (which was good, but a little too greasy for my liking). I wanted to try the TKO but that will have to wait until next time. If only there was a Bouchon closer to me!",

The coffee's quite good (I got a regular latte), a pain au chocolat (also known in America as a chocolate croissant), and two macarons: orange, and coffee.  The pain au chocolat was ok; it was denser than ones I've had in Paris. I asked for it to be heated up, but it was barely heated through. It would probably have been heaven if it had warmed up. But despite its dense interior, the exterior was crunchy and flaky.  The macarons were quite large. Both of my flavors were cream-fillings, which I didn't realize. I prefer jam/preserve fillings. The orange was OK; nothing special. The coffee one was good, but the cream filing was very light and squished out at every bite.   Overall, I expected better of something in the Bouchon empire. I also thought the prices were quite high, considering it was a pastry stand and didn't have seating immediately near it, and because it's Vegas.",

Crunchy butter sugar topping on a sweet layer of thinly sliced apples and a yummy croissant. It was delicious! The macarons were huge! They were about two or three inches in diameter which is huge for a normal macaron. The ratio of filling to shell was perfect, not too much, not too little.

In my opinion, macarons should be a bit smaller unless you're absolutely sure you can get them right. The ratio of cookie to filling was too high, which made them a bit dry. The mint choc chip was decently flavored, but it reminded me a bit of toothpaste. The cookie was a bit too mushy. The passion fruit was a disaster. The filling tasted like buttery egg, and it was only very very slightly passionfruity.   All in all, these are low on the list of macarons for me, and they were also the most expensive by volume. Save your money and try something else, if you fancy yourself a True macaron lover.",

One of my besties (Rosie) and her bf brought some back for me a few years ago, but I never got to try them fresh. The bf and I got a nutter butter, 6 French macarons, and a chocolate dipped raspberry macaron. I thought the macarons were pretty subpar. The NUTTER BUTTER was our favorite thing! It was gigantic and super delicious ! I also really enjoyed the chocolate dipped macaron minus the fact that it tasted like hazelnut when it was supposed to be raspberry, but I'm not complaining I love hazelnut. I thought the texture of the macarons were a bit too chewy. The weird thing though, the macarons tasted better the next day! Instead of becoming stale, they were of beter consistency of a macaron lol. Yum. Most def, would come back for more nutter butters  maybe try a few other flavors of the macarons.",

They are not limited to just macaroons , there are sandwiches , bagels , brownies, muffins , coffees , juices . Well rounded spot for fancy snacking , that you can later walk off . The macaroons have a slight crunch , but then seem to turn into a soft cookie that melts in your mouth . The chocolate ones are the favorite, for they are decadent without being too evil .  Awesomeness comes in small forms at times. There is Yoda , then there are Bouchon Bakery macaroons!",

    "text": "After eating at Bouchon, I really wanted some dessert from Bouchon Bakery. After looking around, I could not find it.  Sadly, I gave up and was on my way. Next time around, I was determined to find it.  It was no wonder I couldn't find it the first time -- It was a small bakery stand.  I assumed it was a large bakery of some sort.  Happy to find some of my favorite treats here, done their way, I was pleased.  Of all the coffees and cupcakes, and other pastries, This is what I got.  The carrot cake sandwich was my least favorite, though it was moist.  I guess I'm not a True fan of carrot cake.  It is either too sweet or too dry.  Theirs was perfectly not too sweet nor dry. The cream cheese frosting in the middle was perfectly sweet. It just wasn't memorable.  Their macarons were expensive, but I had to give it a try.  It can't be as good as Bottega Louie in Los Angeles, can it?  The coffee macaron was actually pretty tasty. The outside had a nice crunch, and the inside was soft and creamy.  The coffee taste was prevalent, but was a bit too sweet.  Nonetheless, it was delicious.  I saved the best for last.  My favorite, the nutter butter cookie was amazing.  The cookie part was crispy and buttery.  The inside peanut butter filling was creamy. It was like an actual nutter butter sandwich cookie, but a hundred times better.  The taste was definitely memorable.  This bakery and sweets shop is really hard to find.  Once you find it though, you will be glad you did.  Their baked goods are of the highest quality. They offer other dessert options as well as sandwiches.  It is perfect for a quick bite to eat or for dessert.  They are underneath one of the escalators.  Try to find them and get your goodies.",

First of all, they're big and in this case bigger IS better, they're light, perfectly chewy and deliciously creamy in the middle. No other Macaron can compare, I continue to try others in hopes that they might be as good but I'm always disappointed.   My absolute favourite is Raspberry, I've tried Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Caramel and I think at one point they had Lemon also. The Caramel straight up had real caramel in the middle, making it extra decadent.   They are just the most wonderful treat possibly ever.",

    "text": "Unfortunately Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian was a huge disappointment. It began with trying to find the small counter located in a most obscure location within the massive property of the Venetian Hotel.  I felt so frustrated by the time we finally arrived and made a comment about the location to one of the many employees behind the counter.  The young lady looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  She couldn't have cared less.  Remember?  This is a Thomas Keller experience and I guess I should have remembered that part.  Once I made my selections I was passed over to the cashier, or was it one of the many other people behind the counter (they were literally bumping into one another because there were so many people behind the counter) where I repeated my order to her and cashed out.  I had selected the ham and cheese on a baguette that was heated up for me and was good.  No complaints.  The bread was fresh and because it was heated had a nice crunch to it.  I had also ordered several other products for the sake of this review and because having recently returned from a 3 month stay in France wanted to have the opportunity to make a fair comparison.  Keep in mind my selections (with the exception of the TKO) are standard faire anywhere in France so in my mind the right selections for the sake of comparison. The almond croissant was so heavy (weight).  As soon as I picked it up I knew it was nowhere close to an almond croissant one would find anywhere in France or any Stateside French bakery.  It was FILLED with almond paste and there was no flakiness whatsoever to the pastry.  I took a couple of bites and tossed it.  I pulled the Financier from the bag and took a couple of bites of it and it too was just a big heavy something or other. I am not trying to sound like a snob but I have come to realize there are \"American\" French (sounds good) Bakeries and there are French Bakeries.  This is definitely an American style French Bakery.  The products are heavy, way too big in size and lack any \"French\" to them.   So to wrap it up, I thought the employees made me feel like I was lucky to be at a Thomas Keller establishment.  The location (or secret hiding place) of this particular \"kiosk\" or \"counter\" was ridiculous.  And finally it is not a French Bakery but a bakery where you can pick up something that resembles a bakery item you would find in France or most French Bakeries Stateside. Sorry Thomas...just sayin'...",

So it's a little hard to find as its tucked away in the back of the casino next to the grand lux cafe. I was surprised at first when I actually found the place. It's much smaller than one would expect. On yelp, it is labeled as a bakery but this place is actually a cafe that happens to sell baked goods. (I didn't have a chance to look at reviews or pictures before finding it) Even if it wasn't what I was expecting I still found it to be excellent.  What I was really looking for here was some great freshly made pastries. Though the croissant I tried was good I found that this place really shines with their prepackaged goods. They have mostly cookies and French macaroons for sale. Wow, were the macaroons delicious! I'd highly recommend those. The coffee was pretty good too. This place is pretty solid in what they do. I'll be sure to be back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "I swooned with envy on numerous occasions looking at everyone's yelp pictures of the fabulous macarons Bouchon Bakery puts out daily. However, during the course of my covetous enchantment Honolulu (my hometown) seemed to have caught on to the macaron craze and now i'm thrilled to see that there's a bunch of places serving up these delightful treats in my own backyard. So when I FINALLY got the chance to try Bouchon Bakery this summer it sort of lost it's appeal. BUT, I had to give Bouchon a try since this is the first place I fell in love (at first sight) with macarons to begin with.  So I decided to try the pistachio macaron, a chocolate croissant and a TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). These are mega macarons, almost twice the size of the usual sold elsewhere. It was delish.I only wish they made smaller sizes so that different flavors can be tried. The chocolate croissant was just okay, maybe because I bought mines in the evening so perhaps it was not as fresh. I was also infatuated with the TKO because who doesn't love a homemade oreo cookie? It was good, but the white filling was a little too sweet for my liking.  Prices were: TKO ($3.25), Chocolate Croissant ($4.00) and macaron ($3.50). No tax was added on so total came out to $10.75.  Location of this kiosk:  The Venetian, under the escalator near the Phantom Theater (or whatever they may have re-named it by now).  So now that I had my thrill filled, would I go back? Let's just say I wouldn't go out of my way to get something from here. BUT if I happen to be in the Venetian I wouldn't mind checking it out again.  My overall rating is 3.5 Stars.",

They had so many different pastries and baked goods to choose one. It took me a while to decide on the Better Nutter (reinvented nutter butter) and a tropezienne (not really sure if that's spelled correctly). My boyfriend got the strawberry croissant and the pain au chocolat.   I really enjoyed the Better Nutter. It was very tasty, and brought back the memories of eating Nutter Butters but SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I'd definitely come back for these =] highly recommended  The tropezienne is like a bready pastry with cream in the middle, there was also strawberry slices in it. It was good but if I could only choose one I'd go for the Better Nutter.  I also tried the strawberry croissant, and that was very tasty also.

I couldn't believe they worked for Bouchon! C'mon T. Keller, get your people up to your food's standards- high. Macaroons= 5 stars; service= 1 (if that).",

    "text": "I stopped by here for a light breakfast while wandering around the Venetian. I had high expectations due to the reputation of the bakery and I was not disappointed. I ordered a chocolate croissant and a coffee macaron. Honestly, this was one of the croissants I've ever had. Every bite was a perfect combination of flaky, airy, tender layers with plenty of chocolate. The macaron was deliciously chewy with wonderful coffee flavor. Speaking of coffee, it was pretty good, as well. Honestly, though, I was more focused on the food and wasn't blown away by the beverage.  The location was a little difficult to find. It's not near the Bouchon Bistro (which is kinda confusing), but tucked away behind an escalator on the main casino. I'm sure there is always a line, especially for breakfast. However, the line moved pretty quickly. It's a little more expensive, but you're paying for quality and it's definitely worth it. I can't wait to come back and try more if the delicious pastries.",

Much, much less sweet than the macarons at Miette in SF Ferry Building.  And even though they were less sweet, the macarons still captured the flavors' intensity quite accurately.  I sampled the chocolate, pistacchio, orange, and lemon.  They were all unique and fantastic.  If it's your first time, I recommend getting the boxed set so you can try out all the flavors they offer that day.  Prices are decent, location a little TOO convenient (passed by the counter while walking out of Tao Beach).  Definitely worth a stop if you are in Vegas and like sweets - especially macarons.",

Loved that it wasn't too buttery and had a stick of chocolate in it! I could definitely taste the chocolate in its puffy croissant. Most of the times I can never taste the chocolate in these pastries, but Bouchon gets it right!   One thing I didn't like about this location is that it didn't have its originality like it did in Yountville. It just seemed like an Anderson Bakery or something. What also sucks is there is no seating area!   Oh well whatever. Makes me happy that I have visited the Yountville, NYC and Las Vegas locations!",

I didn't think the prices were all that bad, considering it was in a toursity area in a toursity city and had high quality, authentic French pastries and food. I saw much crappier food for similar prices in Vegas.  During my stay, I tried the chocolate pudding (3 layers of different flavors, creamy and heavenly and just the right size for a snack), a (huge) raspberry macaron (a bit too sweet but lovely smooth consistency), pain au chocolat (flaky and delicious, with the perfect amount of smooth chocolate chunks inside), and a carrot cake cookie (2 huge cookies, very soft and cake-like, with amazing cream cheese frosting inside).  Service was fine, pretty fast and not at all snotty - if anything, it was the opposite (one woman who helped me pronounced everything incorrectly - it's macaRON NOT macaROON).  Also, bonus points for the fake disposable silverware that looks exactly like the real thing. Very classy, Thomas Keller.",

However, I was a little disappointed with my visit here. I decided on the red velvet cupcake and a caramel macchiato. For $3.50, the cupcake was a good deal for it was the size of a muffin! Most cupcakes I've had are for the same price but pretty dinky in size. The frosting wasn't overly sweet and the red velvet was nice and moist. It was a tad bit doughy though, but nonetheless pretty good. The coffee however, is where things start going downhill. Maybe I came on a bad day or maybe it was a new worker, but I've had caramel macchiato before at various coffee places and never had I had one like this. For $5 I got their smallest size and when I picked up my cup, I was surprised at how light my cup was compared to the other girls that ordered other Lattes and such. I opened my cup and found it to be filled halfway with foam, barely any coffee so I asked the barista if it was the correct order. He just kept saying that that's how it's suppose to be. It didn't seem right, but in any case, I didn't make a scene about it. $5 for half a cup of bitter coffee and foam is not well worth it! They also have a few other things there like sandwiches and such, but all were a bit pricey. Expected I suppose since it is Vegas.",
