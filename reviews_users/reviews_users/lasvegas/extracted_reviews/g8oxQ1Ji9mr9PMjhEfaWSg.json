Great bar food, hilarious bartenders, and you might even get a lap dance from Taco. Perfect place to go for a drink and decide where you'd like to go for the night! 5 star service (with a little sass).",

    "text": "This is a unique establishment. I have never been to another place like it. There were signs near the entrance that told me about the atmosphere. The sign said, \"Warning, staff has been trained to be sarcastic, rowdy, naughty, honry, and colorful. I figured yeah okay everybody is that way. What caught me off guard was the extent that our waitress took it to. She didn't get no more than 10 words out of her mouth before I really felt the urge to fire back. Some of the things that she was saying I would only expect to hear from people that I've known for a long time. After taking a deep breath and thinking of the situation that I was in, I finally realized that what she was doing was part of the show. Though I was getting used to it, I still found myself wanting to jump every time she opened her mouth.  The overall feel of the place is like a party place. Everybody was having a good time. Food was prepared exactly as ordered and served hot. The flavor was bland.  The cost of the entrees were not that far out of line considering this is the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered a tequila and orange juice with two add shots and it nearly floored me when I saw how much it cost me. $37.00 for one drink. I could have almost bought two dinners for the cost of that one drink.  This is one of those places that I will only go to one time and I would have difficulty recommending it to other people.",

We ate a hamburger and chicken nuggets (like we are at a kids restaurant). The food is worse than Mcdonalds. My bf's hamburger tasted as if it was cooked in the microwave. Very limited selection on the menu that is EXTREMELY over priced nasty bar food. The more I think of the concept the more stupid I think is to actually pay someone to be an asshole to you. Save your money go eat somewhere nice that actually has decent food and go to that show you always wanted to go to. I will never return to this ridiculous place.",

My friend ordered the macho nachos which seemed promising but the cheese was totally canned nacho cheese. I would highly suggest they add shredded melted cheddar cheese instead. That would make the dish a whole lot better. A plus on service! I had momma Nancy. She was hilarious, called my friends and I hookers and called me a cheap ass for ordering lemon water hahaha!

I understand if you show up and more than half your party hadn't arrived, but seriously 80% of the group was there. I had read reviews about how some people found Oscar to be \"too much\", but honestly he was great! He was just the right amount of \"rude and crude\" and was a sweetheart at times (but sshhhhhhh, don't blow his cover ;)). The food was overpriced, which is to be expected to a certain extent in Vegas and on The Strip. A friend of mine got a margarita and it was $33! It was pretty big, but still stupid crazy expensive!",

He continued to talk smack to everyone who tried their best at hitting the punching bag machine. I guess you can say this bar tender REALLY was a DICK!  We didn't have any food but it looked like typical bar food. I also paid $18 for two Red Stripe beers.  I guess people go for the environment and to be purposly bad mouthed by the employees.",

Barry the bartender was a real hoot with a top notch personality. You get a tall paper hat that they write some funny saying on. Barry took a bit with mine, but nailed it. My hat read \" The health department closed my legs\" .hahaha. It was my daughters 21st bday. Her hat said \" Its my 21st and all I got was my period\" with ketchup smeared on it. So funny. If you don't know how to take a joke or comfortable with \"being roasted\" this place may not be for you. It is for those that have a sense of humor and want to laugh and not take things seriously. You also will get a balloon hat made for you. Ours was a super cute octopus with big lips.(they actually checked out my daughters tattoo and made the balloon to match it) We hated having to leave it in Vegas as it would not fit in our luggage. =( And finally the food. My daughter and I each ordered and then shared our plates. We got the Ribeye , and steak Caesar salad. We also had a coupon for a free appetizer and got Mozzarella sticks. The food was really really good. The drinks were a bit pricey. But were also very good. I had one drink and my daughter had 2. You get to keep the cups. Our bill came to $100 even. With the quality of the food and the entertainment, and being on the Vegas strip I thought it was reasonable. I highly recommend.",

The waitress didn't really do much that was shocking other than cursing so in a funny way I was a little disappointed with their expectations. I ordered the Dick's Meal; a slab of St. Louis' Ribs with BBQ Beans and sweet potato fries. The ribs were not impressive at all, the beans were good, the sweet potatoes were all right. I ordered a tall glass of Shock Top beer which tasted fine and I got a souvenir cup to go with me. I couldn't hear anybody at all in the place because the music was so loud. It was funny to read some of the paper hats that the staff put on the guests, they were not very PG rated which made it funny. After all of that the waitress added her gratuity to our bill so we ended up not leaving any extra tip since their service was nothing to rave about. I don't feel the need to go back there, I didn't care for the food or the loud music. At least I can say I experienced it.",

You really do need a sense of humor if you plan to take a seat and I really did have a few good laughs...mostly at other peoples expense.  The staff was not as rude as I am seeing in other reviews but if you were at a table with fewer people than you got less attention. My biggest issue is the value. In hindsight I realize it's up to me to ask more questions when ordering but if your like me and you're blissfully \"mid-western\" simplistic than you're in for some serious sticker shock. My wife and I shared an appetizer and each ordered a 32 oz drink and while we waited we decided on a shot. So 1 plate, 2 drinks, and 2 shots came to $101 dollars!!! The shots alone were $16 bucks each! Conveniently none of the drink prices were listed. In conclusion, if you're just financially loaded or just better prepared than I was then I say go for it!  But if you're not...I STILL say go for it!  Just stick with water and get you buzz on somewhere else.",

Now for some details.  They throw water cups at you, and waste napkins like they grow on trees.  Wait, they DO grow on trees! So we roll'em up into little balls and throw them at eachother, and the servers are okay with it.    For the most part, they try to embarrass you but they don't go too far.  What's kind of embarrassing is their prices on the food.  I ordered the wing basket which came with 4 whole wings (8 pieces), celery sticks, and ranch for about 15 bucks including gratuity for a big party of 40.  I tried other food and nothing wow'd me.    I recommend Dicks for a big party, they know how to handle big parties.  I had way too much fun throwing stuff across the room at other people, live bands, wittiness, and reading paper hats with insults on them. But the food was eh.",

If you are sensitive to teasing or opposed to crude humor, then I would avoid this place at all costs, but I have a pretty good sense of humor and went along with the whole \"be rude to the customer\" shtick.      We ordered frozen drinks, which were a bit pricey, but I expected nothing less being in Vegas. The decor was very funky and interesting, complete with ladies' undergarments hanging around the bar. They also give patrons paper hats to wear with crass sayings on them, like \"I stuff my training bar\", that being one of the tamer phrases. Overall we had a fun time, and it's a good place to stop at and relax during the day.",

I spent $138 here last night but upon getting to my room I noticed feathers on my chicken wings, the place was already closed so I came first thing in the morning to return it. Taco the guy in charge at the time said he could not give a refund because I did not have my receipt, I explained I left it with my tip at the table. I also explained that I can tell you exactly where I sat and what I ordered so that he may look on previous transactions. His reply was we have no way of tracking what was spent.....I'm like it was just last night and this is a chain so I'm sure there had to be a way. Well needless to say he would not refund the money so I had to take more food. Not really what I wanted. <a href=\"mailto:Wedocpr@yahoo.com\">Wedocpr@yahoo.com</a> for questions.",

And aside from the drinks everyone says is \"overpriced\" um, apparently they haven't been to Vegas before or haven't spent over $20 for a yard beer or guitar margarita. It's Vegas! Everything on the Strip is expensive but Dick's is the kind of place you go for the experience, not some cheap happy hour joint. The servers are rude, but in a funny sarcastic way. There's a sign warning people at the entrance so you really can't complain later if you can't take a joke. The chicken fingers really are very tender and delicious and not greasy. If you order the beer, you get a collectable cup to keep. Best moment of the night (aside from the hats) was when a server started singing \"Pour some sugar on me\" and dumped sugar packets over the people sitting at the next table.",

Bartender asked if I wanted to Netflix and chill or Firestick and suck my dick. I did (not for your tiny ginger D, but for the service). Thanks Kevin, or Ryan, or who ever touched me in the bathroom. Five stars.",

    "text": "What a great time! We've not been to one of these and I'm really glad we finally decided to. Part of the hesitation was because we didn't know how good the food would be a the other part was a bit of fear of what our crazy hat would say. Going in with the expectation that they will be rude is good but for someone big on service and manners...I needed to remind myself a few times.   Typical busy bar type scene but I loved the long picnic table type of seating. Our waitress was hilarious!! She was a petite, pretty, firecracker of a gal with a sharpe tongue.  Even though she was rude (at all the right times) our service was fast and we never wanted for anything. I loved the fact that the cups are massive as well.   We ordered several of the apps because they seemed large enough to share with the whole group. Everything was good. However the BBQ pulled pork nachos were AMAZING! I'm not just being dramatic, no. These things were awesome. To the point that when we got back home we attempted to recreate them ourselves several times; to no avail. The chocolate bar brownie was terrific too and it had a whole bar of chocolate just melted right on top of the brownie.    We will be back and look forward to trying some of the other locations as well.",

The food was better than a lot of reviews made me believe. And, even not being a fan of pickles, I enjoyed the fried pickles. The fries were perfectly seasoned and the burger was huge (I couldn't even eat it all).  The atmosphere was amazing too! I love the picnic feel of that place. Seating by people you do not know and laughing with them just makes for an amazing time. It really makes for the environment. And yes, the wait staff are dicks (at least most of them) but that is the name of the game. It is just a fun time.   The price wasn't bad. I estimated about $65 dollars for the meal for two and it ended up being about $70 in total (including a tip) which I figure is average for Vegas, especially when you add in the cost of the huge goblet one that is big enough for two.  All in all, it was an awesome time and I loved it!",

And at this place they throw it it your face as soon as you walk in. That's fine. But bad service and ridiculous prices, and an ugly wait staff force one to make you say \"why the hell did I ever go here?\". The staff plays their parts well, being total bitches. That's fine. But if you do that than be fucking hot. Like porn star hot. And at the VERY least, get the orders right and LISTEN to what we're paying almost 200.00 for. I could have easily played along had this waitress, who I am doing a kindness keeping her name out of this review, had gotten our order right, taken the time to listen to a damn thing we said, and delivered my friend his Sprite. I mean how long can it take to deliver a spite? I guess in this case of a totally inept wait staff, who couldn't get a job at Denny's, the better part of two hours. The terms, \"you're fired\", \"what kind of idiot am I to choose such a place\", and \"don't quit your day job\" come to mind. You're better off going to McDonalds. Embarrassing that this place exists inside a Las Vegas casino charging stupid prices. Never again.   Had my fiance not been in charge of the bill, I would have walked out without paying a cent. Which was frankly MORE than this inept waitress deserved. Positive: The hats were funny. Fire your staff and start from scratch. Bitchy is a turn on folks. But only if they actually do their jobs and listen. Lucky I didn't throw my drink in their faces.   If you're stupid enough to ever go to this place, you get what you deserve, as I did. My mistake.  What the bloody fuck was I thinking?",

What makes this place fun is that the waiter makes fun of you, is rude, and politically incorrect. Depending on the size of your group a few of you will get singled out to wear a paper hat with something embarrassing on it- probably something having to do with your sex life. It is fun when in Vegas for a bday or something. Don't come if you are easily offended. It is inside Excalibur and the wait can be a while.",

Is there a lot of sexual innuendo?  Absolutely!  Will there be a bachelor/ette party or something similar going on.  For Sure!  It is a loud place, so not the best for chit chat.  Food quality was better than I expected, but you do pay a premium for the antics.",

The servers are rude on purpose, but not in an overly offensive manner. Your server may make you the spectacle of a joke or jab, bur just go with it and remember it's literally part of their job. Although their breakfast selection is limited to two or three items, the breakfast burrito was great and really hits the spot if you need to cure a hangover. Cautionary tale: pay attention the drink prices and descriptions, as I accidentally ordered something that was huge and priced over $30.",

I picked through the mixture of sauce, meat and fat and pulled put the meat that I could eat. I tried my wife's chicken pasta and the food was bland. Food was way over priced, yeah I get it's Vegas, but still hurts to pay a $50 for only eating half of your food and drinking an over priced beer.

I got yelled at cause I had my hand on my hip while waiting for a table, I got yelled at for them getting my order wrong and I also got yelled at for wanting ranch with my chicken tenders. The wait staff (if you want to call it that) cusses at you and makes fun of you. Its very provocative, but all in all fun.   They throw your silverware and napkins at you. And the Menu is pretty small and posted up on the wall. If you are starving and/or in a rush I don't recommend you come here.  Do NOT come here if you don't have a good sense of humor or if you are at ALL an up tight person. This place isn't for you.   The food was decent, I give it a 3.  The decor, acting, etc. gets a 4.  The bar gets a 5!  All together I give it an overall 4.  After eating lunch and then hanging out at the bar for 2 hours my friend and I left feeling pretty good!!!!",

I understand the premise of the place, staff treating you like garbage and you're supposed to laugh it off as part of the charm, but for real, you gotta draw a fuckin line somewhere.  My story: A friend and I came here to grab a drink and we see a bunch of people wearin these weird paper hats with things like \"asshole\" and other insulting shit like that written on them. I won't write what some of 'em say because they were just plain gross (especially for a place that serves food), again, understand where the line is.   So I start talking to one of the bartender chicks and she tells me the hats are insults that they label individually and, in one of the most twisted compliments (may have been a pass, I really don't fuckin know or care to know for that matter) I've ever had heaved at me in my life. She says to me \"like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get,\" I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying \"right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?\" then just turned around and walked away.   I'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!? Also if I did, that would just not be in the most poorest of tastes to say. Even for a place like this.  Anyways the moral of the story is, know when to draw a line if you're gonna run this type of joint because it's a pretty slippery fuckin slope and shit could get real bad throwing words like that around.",

We asked for napkins and they were also thrown all over the around us.  The waitress did get the job done and took our orders. She made us hats - insulting ones of course.

I thought, \"Wow, okay why not.\"  So when my friends and I went to Vegas, we went.    For some reason, I envisioned that there would be hot guys being total jerks to you.  But all I saw were these fat sweaty wanna-be mean people boys.  HAHA!  They were definitely dicks, and their were their infamous rude hates of course.  Here are some they wrote on my visit:  - I'm so small, I pee on my balls. - Happy ending $5 - Deposit here (with a hole for where the mouth is) - It's razor burn, not herpes. - When I was a man, my name was Steve. - I choke my chicken to Little Mermaid. - I lost my virignity to Moses.  The girl that had the \"Deposit here\" hat, I felt bad for her.  The waiter got \"all the guys\" attention, (Yes, she was an attractive girl.) and pulled the hat down to where the mouth matched the hat's whole.  I felt so bad for her!  The food here, I thought was freaking delicious! I ordered the \"Big Ass Burger\" and it was superb!  Service, sucked for obvious reason.  The fat guy, ran around the tables with butcher paper screaming for us to pick everything off the table so he could throw it on as our tablecloth.  Threw our water cups at us.  We had 5 at our table, he threw way more than that.  The utensils were metal and he dropped it on the table.  When the food came, he slid everything off his serving platter.  Well, this place is definitely for someone with a sense of humor.  It's all fun and games, until he puts a hat on you.  Then you're like, \"I hate this place.\"  It happened to me, but eh, these people aren't ever going to see me again anyway! Haha.",

One of their trademarks is making hats out of butcher paper and your server will write a funny message on it.

Everything was delicious and on time. Also I wasn't really feeling well and they were kind and considerate enough to realize that I wasn't in the mood to be joked around with too heavily. But they still put me in a good mood and gave me a hat with the dirtiest joke imaginable. Definitely added to my Vegas experience.",

I had no idea what was waiting for me!  Good: + Get ready for some serious insults, sh*t talking and things being thrown at you! You get a hat to wear that is custom insult hat as well. Menus will get tossed at you. The waitresses will mock you and you need to be sure you're ready for this! + I received a \"dance\" by one of the guys here that sat me on a chair and gave me a \"lap dance\". It was more of an insult  and mockery dance. It was hilarious! The guy ended up showing a G-string thong! Cost was $40 and well worth it! + Food here is good. Had a few appetizers, burgers etc and it was good.  + Fun atmosphere of course. + Drinks were poured heavy. No watered down stuff here.  + Price was on par with other places around.  Not so good: - Nothing.  Overall, this is a fun and EXTREMELY unique experience. Just remember not to take anything to heart or too seriously. One of my friends was starting to get irritated with the insults, but it's nothing personal. It's all about having fun! I highly recommend you try this place out!",

The beer was crappy, especially when served in a plastic cup. The service was ok, the server did the bare minimum. The prices were a little above average, but you're in Vegas, so it wasn't terrible. Mehhh, we only ate here because we were too lazy to walk to another casino and didn't wanna Uber somewhere else. However, this wouldn't be my top choice. We sat at the bar, ordered water and beer. The beer was served in a plastic cup, which is gross and had I'd known I would have ordered a bottle. The water came in a plastic cup also, which we were charged 75 cents for. I wouldn't mind, but we were never told or given another option. We sat forever before we got our food, a little over an hour. The food was good though. I ordered the Cajun Mac and cheese which was delicious. It had a good flavor and the chicken pieces were juicy. My buddy ordered the bacon cheddar burger w/fries, and he said it was alright. I can't speak for him because I didn't try it and was too busy eating my food.",

I had their burger and it was well done and tasty for sure. Other people got salmon and other fish and chips they said they were cooked well also.

Of course you can't come here and not expect to be made fun of, but it was all good humor.  Our waiter was great and putting up with a table of 12 girls can probably be difficult.  He was truly the right amount of \"dick\" to not seem very rude, but to enjoy the fun of the environment.  You definitely have to have a fun sense of humor when visiting this restaurant.  Our hats that he made were all comical and of course perverted since we were a bachelorette party.  The food is pretty good.  The bartenders were very friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  If there was one thing I could say that isn't a five star it would be the fact that there aren't walls separating the casino and it smells SO much like smoke, overwhelmingly of cigarette smoke.  I would recommend for a casual lunch destination with a fun environment.",

Beer: here' s a tip - don't order beer from the tap. It comes with a \"souvenir\" plastic 'glass' and therefore costs $10 for cheap stuff like Coors Light and $12 for better beer. And that's for the small one. You can instead buy a 24 oz tall-boy in a can of Miller Lite for $5. Also look around for beer specials, we could have bought 2 pitchers of PBR and had a 3rd free. The bartenders don't willingly inform you that their beer's a rip off.   Food: another tip - don't eat it. It's just awful. We were a big group so I saw what all came out. Completely mediocre bordering on sketch. I got some awful thing with rice, a hamburger patty, eggs on top with gravy. The hamburger party and the gravy were nasty. The patty clearly comes to them shaped and frozen and when sliced into it looks like the most pathetic and low quality beef ever. Blarf. I tried to look up what this creation was called so you can be sure to steer clear but their website is so awful I got fed up and quit. Gross. Good luck.",

The only thing I can say is I wish I worked there! for the servers it must be pretty cool to not worry about giving good customer service and receive excellent tips due to the high prices. I would recommend coming only once just to get rid of the curiosity.",

Our waiter was great but the other waiters looked like they were engaging with their customers a lot better and that they were having a lot more fun. If it's your birthday let the waiter know so that you can get a free but horrible lap dance by the bartender who's wearing a thong. Lol The food was surprisingly very good! My boyfriend had the steak and I had the shrimp platter ! Both very good ! The drink I got was very very very sweet. Fun spot !",

Our bartender/server was attentive and hilarious. I tend to turn red when I'm embarrassed and I think he sensed it, so he would give me a playful, \"I'm not serious\" wink to reassure me. He was a gentle soul even when he told me he \"didn't give a shit,\" when I asked for a water. He then hilariously brought me a cup of ice. My friend called out, \"She asked for water.\" He stared at her in silence and then without emotion said, \"She didn't specify what form she wanted the water in,\" and walked away.

This place never disappoints, but today the experience was completely the best one yet.    Our server Christine all I got to say is momma ( inside joke I would call her mom each time she came around) got some mad skills being a server and a great hostess. She is completely sarcastic, rude, obnoxious well hey that's what you ask for when you go in. The difference with her she is very kind hearted and literally goes over all the menu and in its full entirety and tells you what to expect with each dish.  Christine is by far the best hostess ever in that establishment since I've gone in numerous of times she is literally the only one who has ever gone over the menu with me and explained everything and that speaks highly for her care of customer service for all patrons, I was able to hear her in action with all the patrons surrounding us.  Literally today was the best experience ever. Couldn't have asked for more. She thrives when patrons are sarcastic with her she has some pretty good comebacks and she was keeping me on my toes all night and I can tell she was loving it. When I stopped her to have a word with her she was still joking telling what now princess, but explained in all honesty you are by far the only one who has ever gone over the menu and really have taken the time to really make us aware of everything she was taken back by it and you can tell she appreciated the fact that I made her aware of that and really for a second thanked us with some sort of kind hearted emotions then told us well bye and don't forget to tip you're mother generously and laughed walking away.  Now that's what I call the best service ever. Christine you Fucken Rock!!!!! I'm definitely asking to sit in her table when I come back that's a guarantee.",

We were prepped by my friend Jae to expect off -the -wall, ruder than ever kind of humor.  Inside looked like a trashed up Joe's Crab Shack which I didn't mind so much I guess although, it's probably better to sit outside if it's offered to you.    The waiters and servers were rude, crude, loud and proud of it.  TIght wads need not enter.  It was fun bantering back.  And the boyfriend and I each got a nice little slap in the buttocks by a perverted Elvis impersonator (wtf?).  The only gripe I have about this place is the food.   I think they pose as a restaurant.  Humor first, food secondary.  I mean really, secondary.  I think the best part of my meal was the root beer (and that's after they told me that they don't have Dr. Pepper ...\"or Mr. Pibb either so don't bother asking\").  If you've ever had that urge to give your waiter sh*t this is the place to do it.  And the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter whether you're joking or not.",

The bf had fond memories of this place, and since we were tired and didn't want to walk far from the MGM we ventured over to Dick's. The live band playing on stage was actually pretty good, but the volume was just way too loud for me. The place was pretty packed, so we took a seat at the bar. The bartenders promptly served us and you can tell they enjoy ther jobs, very enthusiastic. So in terms of service effort, they do a good job. The bf got a margarita on the rocks, I opted for a cranberry and vodka. If you know me, you know I love me some Vodka, but I seriously couldn't even drink it, the vodka tasted nasty. But I guess I shouldn't expect top shelf Vodka at this place. We ordered the sampler platter to share. It was edible, but I suspect there were some empty frozen, microwaveable appetizer boxes in the kitchen.   I won't be retunrning. But can see the appeal this place has for kids that frequent frat parties and whose palates don't mind cheap alcohol and food.",

We were disappointed, however, because all we got was indifferent service, at best. No hat offers, no teasing, no nothing. The worst we got was the napkins tossed at our faces and all our straws dunked in one drink. It was lame. I wont go back again because it takes too long to get in there, and if your friend just happens to go to the loo when they finally decide to call u up, u have to wait till they come back. Laaaame. Oh, and the food was meh for the price they charged. We could have gone to T.G.I.Fridays or Applebees and gotten the same thing for cheaper.",

What you really come for is the experience, and for Taco. The theme of the restaurant is that it is literally your last resort for food because the service is so \"bad\". The servers put on a rude front and play jokes on you and make each guest wear a hat with a provocative saying. It is honestly a lot of fun and a great place to go with a group for a birthday, bridal party or even just for fun.   It is a lot of fun and a must do if you are in Vegas. It;s great to see the servers improvise, especially when they hear it is not your first time.   Ps. Taco is a bartender who literally tattooed taco on his stomach. He will come around to your table and put his tattooed belly in your face. He is always up for taking photos too :)",

He started off by just glaring at us as we walked in, and not even bothering to greet us. We approach the counter to order he scoffs and says \"Where are your IDs??\" He then checks our IDs and proceeds to TOSS them across the counter and looks at us and yells \"Now what do you want??\" Finally after our unpleasing encounter we grab our drinks and proceed to pay. Here is when we meet with another crappy sever... Each of our drinks came out to $17 and we both gave him a $20 bill. He then just takes our money, walks away, and doesn't give us our change...  He didn't ask if we needed change he just thanks us, says bye and continues on with his conversation with a coworker. Like wtf?! Are you seriously going to tip yourself after you did nothing and your old hag of a coworker scolded us?? Unbelievable. At this point my friend and I were so offended that we just walked out, letting those stupid servers take our change.  I get that the theme to this place is to act like a dick but at no point was there a joke cracked or any kind of sarcastic humor. Point is I will NEVER be coming back to that place.",

My friend and I were just looking for a quick bite nearby rather than walk the strip looking all around, so we settled on Dicks.   We sat up at the bar and ordered some drinks, my friend asked the bartender if he enjoys any of their salads, he was quick to respond with \"Does it look like I eat salads?\" (he was on the heavy side). I giggled. When we asked for menus the bartender simply pointed at some chalkboard with food scribbled on it. A bit later the bartender came around and tossed a handful of napkins in the air at us and made it rain napkins, I was thoroughly confused.   I ordered some burger thing and my friend ordered a salad. My burger tasted bad and my friend didn't like her salad much more.  When our plates were cleared one of the girls told me to \"move my shitty phone\". It was only after that remark I realized what Dick's was about, I only wish I knew sooner, I was in awe of the horrible service, but now I realize it was purposely like that. I guess the jokes on me. Too bad the food was terrible. Only thing that kept me sane was my awesome friend!",

It's located inside the Excalibur (kinda random) but easy to get to if you're staying at Mandy or Luxor thanks to the tram.  I can't speak to the food, only had a few beers at the bar.  It's a very busy place.  Sometimes there's live music, so it can get kinda loud.  I'd say it's a good rendezvous point for your group to decide what's next for the night.  There's a Dick's Last Resort in San Diego too.  I think that's where it started.",

After being seated, we looked around and found the game on, but then it was switched over to another game. When the server brought out our drinks, I said something about it and asked if we could get it on at least one of the screens. He said that we could not and that there was nothing he could do about it. I apologized, but said we would have to go, and left our drinks untouched and unpaid for. As we were leaving, a party of four came in wearing Seahawks gear. I informed them that they refused to turn the game on for us, and they turned around and walked out with us too. Not sure where they went, but we went next door to the Luxor and had a fantastic time at the Public House - well worth the $85 I dropped on lunch.",

I THINK NOT!!! THE BURGERS NO TASTE THE PULLED PORK was bad the taste was the BBQ sauce that they put on top to the point that the bread was TOOO wet... it is not worth the money or even your time the staff tries to be FUNNY but I dont find anything funny a bout a Waiter kissing a patron during your dinnng experience..

We ordered mozzarella sticks to share, I got the cajun chicken pasta and and the boyfriend got the fried catfish. The mozzarella sticks were nasty! When they first came out they were cold so we sent them back and when they came back (at the same time our other plates came out) they were warm so we ended up just throwing them out. My cajun pasta was alright, if the noodles weren't overcooked I could imagine it being a good plate but we had already sent the mozzarella sticks back and I didn't want to send my plate back because the place is called Dicks so I can only imagine what they would like to do if I sent another plate back. The boyfriend's the catfish was the highlight of the meal, it is the best piece of fried fish I have ever had. If I could give stars just for the fish I would it 5 stars - it was perfectly crispy, there wasn't an excess oil like most other fried food has and I really couldn't get enough of it. We ended up just sharing his plate.   The service was hella funny which we both were enjoying - talking shit back to the waiter, listening to the stupid shit he would say to the other customers (he kept calling an older woman grandma!) and those hats they give out are hilarious. My hat said \"I make white trash look sexy\" and my boyfriends said \"Still waiting for the other ball to drop.\"   If it was just me and the boyfriend I don't think we'd come back but if we came with friends or family and they wanted to try it out I wouldn't mind tagging along.",

    "text": "Located in The Excalibur Hotel Casino on the famous Las Vegas strip. ok so it's not a super swanky Las Vegas ultra lounge (what ever the devil that is) Yes this place is over the top, yes it is gimmicky. So what it's fun, you know what you are getting into when you walk thru the door. The staff are actually quite nice and funny.  I judge bar food by its wings, and trust me I have had some sub-par wings in my day, I rose that back I have had some bone fide dreadful wings in my day, wings so bad that I had to run home assume the prenatal position and turn the electric blanket up to 10! Thank goodness for Dicks these wings were great! I drank a PBR tall boy ($5 Happy hour) out of the can I felt so dirty, but I will live!  Well worth a stop in, unless you like paying $17 for a beer.

They lived up to the name \"Dicks\" but the food wasn't good at all even after drinking. French fries tasted old but the server brought out fresh ones. That was cool. Fish & chips/chicken strips tasted old and if under a heat lamp for a while. Nicely the server didn't charge for those two because we told her they tasted old. Would've gave 1 star but because of the discount they averaged out.  Do not recommend",

    "text": "If you don't easily get offended by profanity or mockery towards you, then I think you will enjoy this restaurant.  It is located inside the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the Las Vegas Strip.  Supposedly but not sure, this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant.  The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service.  When you first walk in, the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about. You could say yes or no while you are being seated. But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and can't help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls.  Or you'll hear profanity being shouted by the servers... of course in the name of fun.    Believe it or not,  the food and drinks here are quite good.  We ordered a bacon burger, a local moco, and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush, an iced tea, and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries.   The bacon burger was huge. It's prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries.  It was good.  The local moco was also delicious. The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath.  It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second.   The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal.  I really did not expect anything special. I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else. Oh boy, I was wrong! The rib eye was cooked medium, and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces. It was served with steamed vegetables, but the meat was delicious with flavor.  The iced tea is just iced tea,  but their spiked slushies are awesome.  It's sweet and is fruity... very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it.  However,  the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though... haha.  Fyi, all the food and drinks ordered is for three people. In case you thought I was a big eater, which i am. Haha.   Dick's is a very fun place to hang out.  Good food and drinks makes a difference. The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude.  But you must be able to not get offended easily from what's said, and be cool.  Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks.  Enjoy your time there and cheers!",

    "text": "Went to Dick's Last Resort over 4th of July weekend. Surprisingly it wasn't too busy. The concept of the restaurant is for the employees to be obnoxious, rude, and cruel. The do a great job bringing the concept to life but in reality I feel like they take it too far.   If it is your first time they'll explain to you the run down of the restaurant. After that, the gloves are off. When taking our initial order we didn't even get a chance to order our appetizers. When our waitress walked by, i asked to order an appetizer and she didn't even acknowledge me. I also wanted to clarify if free appetizer on yelp would work if i check in. Literally 5 minutes before our food came out a server brought out our food.   The food overall is ok, nothing special honestly. Typical bar food, decent bbq, french fries weren't any good. They charge you for \"tap\" water. But for the price we paid, the food is definitely not worth it. When we got the bill, our waitress said the redeem a free appetizer on yelp doesn't apply to the appetizer we ordered. WHICH WE WOULDNT HAVE ORDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGED US AND TOLD US IN THE FIRST PLACE.   Overall I give it 2 out 5 stars. Would I go back, not unless someone I knew really wanted to go. I'd rather go eat at a food court or buffet. Save your money and spend it else where.",

I get that the server is trying to be a \"dick\" but service shouldn't be lacking because of it. With that said, our server at this location, Christine, found the perfect balance! She was a major dick but still tended to our needs like one would expect in a restaurant.   The menu was very overwhelming to me... Three separate sheets! But she went over it quickly and got us familiar with the items and made a few recommendations. (Here's a tip: don't get the chicken strips! Ha!)   We were seated instantly on a busy Thursday evening, quickly greeted, drinks seemed to come to our table as soon as we ordered them, and the food quickly followed. One person in my party was a huge dick, while one was super shy. Christine went full force on our party's \"dick\" and kept it a bit calmer for our shy friend. She really wanted to make sure we all had a good time.   I ordered a burger but I realize I should have followed Christine's advice and gotten something more BBQ themed because my friend's pulled pork was amazing.   I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Las Vegas again. (Who am I kidding, I'll be back to Vegas!)",

There are plenty of warning  signs about they are and are not.  So, to have the servers, well turn into servers first and a lot less about the banter and interaction with the customer is not good.  It took away from the experience.    They changed their signs advertising Taco and are apprehensive to be fired if they put on the old routine.    The drinks are too expensive and the food isn't good enough to carry this theme on their shoulders.   Corporate, if your reading this message and still think you've made a good decision.  Several of us at different tables all discussed the changes and agree they are not good.  Try some exit surveys and of previous customers and see what we say.    Barry and TT are still your best servers but you have handcuffed them and it may cost you the chain.",

    "text": "Yup, another stupid review that will match someone else's stupid review. It'll be so stupid it will be fun to read. (I hope)  I have now experienced Dick's four times here in Las Vegas. The first time we (my wife and I) went I was given a chef's hat that read \"What I Love About This Place Is I Can Have Dick's Sauce On My Chin And That's Okay.\"   The next time we went we took our son who was in his late teens at the time. We were not given any hat's, but our server did give our son what some would call \"a motorboat\". Thus he had yet to eat, yet loved this place already.  The third time we went I was given a hat that read \"I Fondle Myself During Nascar\". By now I was ready, I read the hat, looked at our server and said \"How did you know?\" During our third visit we were with my sister-in-law. The sister-in-law and I ordered the same kind of soda with our meal. What we were served was a small bucket with said soda inside it. With two straws. Now that I think of it, I hope she didn't backwash in that straw.  The fourth time the wide and I went it was just us. The wife and I, not the sister-in-law, not the now early twenty-something son. My wife's hat read \"I still love to blow bubbles.\" Mind read \"Hi, I'm Bubbles.\" Not a few short minutes later a man was leaving, noticed my hat and said \"Hi Bubbles.\" What else could I do? I just looked at him and said \"Hi, how you doing?\"  This place is fun. But if you are easily insulted, this place is not fun, go get some fast-food.  By the way, Dick's serves food. We ate all of ours. We were full after we ate it. I've been there four different times. What do you expect ?",

I give this place a 4 stars because they never gave us menues and we sat for some time until my husband had to get up and get them. Ok other then that is does live up to its reputation name dicks! The server was a complete dick but it was funny. They gave us funny hats and we had a blast. You have to experience it yourself. Also it was kind of expensive but it's Vegas.",

Don't do it! It is pricey and it's not worth it. If you get it, don't say I didn't warn you. Maybe you can order the wings.... maybe. The fried shrimp has too much batter on it, the nachos are basic, and the cajun pasta is bland. I do wish they had decent food here.  Service: They are D***(S)... but hey that's what you come here for right?!?! Seriously, don't come here if you can't take sarcasm, witty humor, and light insults. There was a woman there that started being extremely disrespectful to our server and it was uncalled for. If you can't take the criticism, don't come... simple. They make hats at the end that are hilarioussss.  Make sure you get yours!!!  Location: Pretty easy to find.  Overall: It is an experience you should have on your Vegas resume! :) (I know they said they don't care about my yelp review but here we are.... LOL)",

She said they wrote silly sayings on hats and were kind of a rude wait staff. Latter was fine. Waitress did an awful job at reading our table though when she made the hats - we had 5 kids with us, all about 10. The sayings on the adult hats were all R rated which didn't bug us. The sayings on the kid's hats were a combination of R rated and very poor humor - a type that kids did not understand and several got upset. Not sure why this place has a kid's menu because there's no way I'd ever bring a kid back here. Food was decent, but the schtick got old.",

On the plus side, we had such an awesome waitress!  2 star because our waitress was awesome and the birthday show, but the other stars did not make it because of the food and because of the warm beer. The beer was served in a plastic cup..... What the heck... and we asked for another beer because it was hot.. They offered us ice... That was serious and they werent trying to be funny because our waitress's tone changed and she almost whispered it to us.   PS. pay $20 for the birthday surprise. TOTALLYY worth it!!!!",

While we didn't get much of the experience just the waitress taking our order, bringing our drinks and charging us, I felt like we didn't get much of the experience. We were all drunk but I did notice that the food was mediocre. I had the ribs and wings with a soda. I do remember my bill being around $3x.xx. Because it's Vegas I didn't check my bank statement until I got home in LA. I noticed they charged me $65.xx I asked all my friends if they got double charged or anything and they checked and they were charged correctly. Just be aware of how much they charge you. I don't even bother fighting it because I go to Vegas once a year and see no point of calling them. Disappointing that the waitress probably took advantage since she noticed we were drunk.",

It seemed like others were getting more attention and jokes from theirs while ours kind of just threw our utensils and food at us which was still funny, but I guess we were expecting more. I ended up getting a Caesar salad and added salmon and was pretty happy with the meal as the salmon was cooked well and they gave a generous sized salad. A couple of us also ordered frozen drinks and got an extra shot I think for an extra $2 which I highly recommend. I think we got the 2nd size and were surprised how much we felt it after 1 drink. Not sure I would return if back in Vegas but glad we experienced it at least once.",

He was a dick!  ;)   The fam split an order of Crabby Balls and an order of Macho Nachos.

The tables are long picnic style. There were maybe 20 people in the entire restaurant including the bar. There were more empty tables than patrons! We like to sit next to each other, so we did. The hostess rudely informed us that other people will be joining the table so we must sit opposite. There was no joking or sarcasm involved. She is flat out rude. I waited for her to get out of my vision and we resumed our preferred position. Our server had absolutely no problem with it. She was a riot! She knew the perfect balance of when to be obnoxious and when not to. We tried the gator- very delicious! Then we shared the steak salad which was also very tasty. We ordered shots with the fancy light up glasses to keep. We enjoyed our meal. And for the record, no one else ever did join our table. Boo for the hostess.",

As we entered and got seated it seemed to be ok and funny!  We understood the concept of this restaurant 100%.  We read the is and isn't board before entering.  There might have been poor judgement on the waitress behalf and we were treated very poorly. She turned us over to another waitress and one person from our party was singled out and no service for that person.  The waitress out load called someone from our party rude and uncalled for names. If they didn't want to serve us as a whole party for whatever reason we should have been asked to leave and given a reason for such actions. There was absolutely no reason to have been treated as we did. We didn't even get a manager to come over.  This waitress served many tables around us and introduced herself and explained the concept. It was not done to us.  It was very uncomfortable and was too late to leave. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

I heard big talk about how great the terrible service was. I went with a group of 10 ladies who were all expecting to be treated like crap.   The waiter was a little short with us, but not too rude. They did make dunce caps for a bunch of us with some really raunchy quotes on them that were funny.   The food was typical bar food-chicken strips, buffalo chicken sandwiches, burgers, etc. It all tasted decent-good food to eat before a big night of drinking!  Some other tables looked to be treated a little crappier than us, but I don't think I'll make an effort to head back there next time when I'm in Vegas.",

If you want a good laugh and don't mind potentially being the butt of the joke, find a seat in Dick's Last Resort and watch the funny antics happen. I watched  a waiter rub his luscious man belly on a bald guys head and then kiss him full on the mouth. I almost peed myself and choked on my food at the same time. It's fun, it's campy, and the good isn't to bad either. It's moderately priced and they have all kinds of funny little gifts you can purchase too. Definitely give it a try if your looking for a good time!",

The whole point is that everyone here is a dick... at Dick's Last Resort.   This place is a blast if you realize its all in good fun. My friend picked a fight with the waiter before she knew he was a waiter. As the night went on he gave us all personalized paper hats with obscene comments... my group's hats read as follows:  \"Blah blah blah, just put it in my butt.\" (mine, because I didn't say much) \"I haven't seen my penis since fifth grade.\" (for my larger bf) \"Ask me about my DSL's\" (my smart ass friend) \"Puberty sucks\" (for my 22 year old asian friend who looks 14) \"I masturbate to Justin Timberlake videos\" (my metrosexual looking friend) and the ladies next to me had one that was great too...  \"Dr. Phil makes me moist\" and \"Ask for my number, I'm easy.\" You have to wear the hat the whole time or they give you hell.   The bartender put on a show behind the bar that was both hilarious, poetic, and obscene, including water and opera singing.   The group behind us had a birthday, and a fat guy with an afro gave the birthday girl a lap dance. He was so over the top. He even had a thong sticking out of his shorts (whale tail on a guy is funny!)  The food was good. There were big portions and it was fairly cheap for food on the strip (about $15 a person plus drinks). They served buckets of beer which I thought was cool.   I went in thinking this was going to be an obnoxious experience, but came out laughing.",

The drinks are pretty strong and that's good but it's super loud and dirty.  The food is pretty shitty and the few times I've been here I can't even finish whatever it is that I end up ordering.  The best thing about this place is the walk-up bar where you can get the mixed slushy drinks. Those have a ton of liquor in them but will mess you up even more from all the sugar that they contain.  If you want to wear a stupid hat with some crude thing written on it (see other reviews for examples) and get decent drinks and eat shitty food while you're unable to hear anything other than the loud shitty music being played, this is your place. If you're just going for drinks and that's all you're looking for, then go someplace else.",

I cant remember his name it was a hispanic name.. he has dark hair and wears glasses.. loved him! The food was ok just your typical wings, nachos or whatever and drinks were good and pricey but thats Vegas so wasnt shocked! The atmosphere is loud and fun.. I love that though especially when your ready to party in Vegas... if you wanna have a fun fun time go to Dicks!",

The waitress we had was really nice, but she acts like an asshole because that's her job description. They write these things on a big piece of paper and make you wear it as a hat, but they say dirty things in the paper.   I have it a four star because I didn't like the food options.

Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere, even if people are assholes to you, but they're all really nice in the end. It's all fun in games",

    "text": "If you're looking for a novel place to hangout and you're in need of some entertainment and drinks, then. this could be the place for you and some friends.  When you first arrive, the hostesses may look like they're having a bad day or just annoyed that you're there- please know that it's all part of what makes Dick's Last Resort what it is, they set the tone for your dining experience.  The staff will shock you with their rude behavior, cut downs, and snide remarks making the experience for hanging enjoyable and fun.  Our waiter was quick to give a ghetto large sheet of paper as tablecloth and get our drink order.  The menu is basic and simple and feature large drinking vessels that you can take with you when you leave.  Don't expect the food to be a culinary phenom, it's pretty basic BBQ type of menu but nothing really spectacular, which, in this restaurant, I feel is ok. It's more about the experience and comedy that draws it's crowd.  As my group sat and found ourselves laughing at our waiters rude and playful remarks, I did notice a family dining next to us with kids. Just a note to any future families with kids who enter this restaurant, please know that the restaurant may not be the best choice to bring your little kids, unless you're a progressive family and don't mind foul language, cursing, or sex jokes.   If I had to give it a movie rating, it would, rated PG-13 :)  Towards the latter part of our eating experience, the waiter places a ghetto made hat with a colorful and rude quote on it (check out the pics included with this review) giving it that final crazy touch that made this restaurant fun!  If you're in Las Vegas at The Excalibur, I would definitely recommend having friends get together for happy hour and kick start your evening here for some great drinks and fun rude atmosphere!",

The concept is - the wait staff treats you rudely - wwhhaattt??-  Other restaurants do it inadvertently - and often- so hell - we are used to it - right? The food is not great - but bring your sense of humor and you should be fine.  The wait staff constructs these paper hats - with their own handwritten message on the front for all to read.  A little embarrassing - but what the hell - you just dropped a ton of cash in the slot machines and are lying to your friends about how much you really lost-so some silliness should be tolerated. They get 4 stars just for trying - if nothing else.",

The gentlemen sitting across from me were in just as much shock at the comment.  Needless to say I will not be returning.

I knew from the beginning this place was going to be a hit and it was my boyfriends first time at a restaurant like this.   We were staying at this resort and needed to kill some time before doing anything, so we walk up to hostess stand and she asked how many, you know the usuals. She offers us to join a picnic style table with others or if you want the best time while there go to the bar.   We listened. It was my first time at the bar at any Dicks. SO. GLAD. WE. LISTENED!! Major difference between bar and table is the attention you receive and you don't get one of those fancy paper hats. That sucked as it was something I remember being hilarious.  BUT... our bartender was hands down one of the funniest people I've ever experienced at a Dicks. He was really able to read guests to see how much of an ass/dick he could be and how far he could take the jokes. Some jokes were inappropriate but hello it was funny! Our bartender was KEVIN!   It is definitely not a place to go if you don't have a silly side, if you don't know how to take a joke and don't handle sarcasm well. There was a lot of cursing and inappropriate humor but it was hilarious and WE had a great time.  We enjoyed ourselves so much we started or vacation here and ended it here. The drinks are good and are a good size for the price. The food is good too! We will definitely be back when we visit Vegas again!!!",

The servers are cool because they make a bunch of jokes without taking it too far but don't be sensitive! I forget the name of the waitress we had but she was hilarious. She kept calling me a slut LOL.  Okay but as for the food itself, literally so bad and the veggies probably came out of a can. This is definitely a place you go to for the experience and not the actual food. The menu is small and has no descriptions of any of the meals so you have to ask what comes with it. Oh and I burnt my tongue on a mozzarella stick that sucked.  ANYWAYS it's kinda pricey and food is meh so I'm not sure if I recommend. On the other hand, it was probably the funniest dinner I had during my Vegas trip. They have good drinks too!",

Even my girlfriend was angry about it. The food was also very gross and burned. It looked like total shit. Plus, the TACO dude came up to my girlfriend and lap danced on her and it made her very angry. I yelled at him \"GET THE FUCK OFF OF MY GIRL!!\" and that is when we left very angry and offended.

He inquired further into our experience, was sorry it was not up to par, and offered us compensation via gift certificates we can use next time we are in Vegas. So, if you have an unsatisfactory experience here, just know that management is good and they'll make it right for you, either at the restaurant or afterwards if you let them know. Thank you Guy, for resolving this issue with us.   I thought this place would be a fun experience, mainly because of the 'attitude' of the waiters and the fun hats they give you. Sad to say I was very underwhelmed, mostly because of the awful food and expensive prices. We went here for late lunch. We ordered the big beers, thinking they would come in the fun pilsner souvenir cups, but instead those were served in cheap plastic throw away cups, so the menu is very misleading. They were also $15 a pop. What a waste. I ordered the chicken fried chicken because it sounded like the jalapeno gravy was a nice addition to the meal. There was nothing special about it, and it came with a jalapeno on the side, so I guess that is what they meant by 'jalapeno' gravy.  The mixed vegetables were just like something you'd throw in the microwave at home. My husband got the Buffalo chicken sandwich, which was basically a chicken breast dipped in hot sauce and served with a cup of ranch. For what you pay (easily close to $20 per dish) the food quality is super low. Prices should be about 1/2 of what they are on the menu. I know, I know, you are probably paying for the 'serving entertainment' but that doesn't cut it when the food is crappy and overpriced. I'd say our server was okay, she made a few fun comments and gave us the fun hats, but it could have been better. I saw other servers that were at their tables more often making the snide remarks. We won't be back. Our bill was like $75 including tip and that was absolutely ridiculous for the overall quality of the food and experience. Vegas-goers don't be fooled by the fun atmosphere here, go somewhere else! Or just settle for a drink at the bar instead of wasting money on the food.",

The food is delicious and the service is so quick! I recommend the BBQ Nachos and Mac and Cheese Cheeseburger! The Tutti Frutti cocktail is to die for the bans and strawberry liquor!  Though sassy with attitude, because that is there job, the servers are consistently nice and pleasant to have! They always have gotten the food to our table on time and made the expletive great! Can't wait to go back again soon!",

    "text": "\"What's up, dickhead?\" That's why I love stopping at Dick's when I'm in a town with one.  This place is similar to many in so many ways, including the defaced, dick-joke-ridden $1 tips taped up all around the bar. Fuckin' classic!  The beer selection here kinda sucks, tho; of 28 offerings, there are three, only THREE beers on the menu I can't get back in WI.  Bar food is pretty standard and the brisket, as a $4.99 add on to my plate of $17.99 chicken tenders & fries was ok but that could be because I'm eating at 11:50 my time and the last thing I ate since 2:00 was a bag of ~6 mini pretzels on my flight. In reality, there's a reason it's smothered in BBQ sauce; it's pretty bland otherwise.  BUT half a 6% Scotch ale already has me feeling a-ok.",

I guess we were expecting the worse in service since that's kind of the fun of it. Well not necessarily service, but just thought they'd be more rude. But our server was playful and got some funny paper hats like everyone else. definitely a place i'll be frequently more times when I come to vegas. granted  only went there once during a slower time of the day so will check it out during busier time and hopefully it doesn't disappoint but as far as my initial review I enjoyed as well as our group 9. Like the sizes of beers available so its definitely a place good to go drink. didn't try too much food and was alright but we mostly went there for drinks and laughs and we got both!",

What they wrote on the hats were creative and funny, but the waiter just seemed to be reading off his script in his mind, it was almost robotic. So the \"terrible\" \"experience\" was actually literally terrible. Maybe it was just our waiter, because the other tables seemed to be having fun with theirs, but he seemed to be bored. The food wasn't so-so, it was actually pretty horrible. I ordered the chicken breast, veggies, and rice, and it was simply just that. The chicken only had salt and pepper to taste, the veggies and rice were plain and simple. Very bland and our appetizers were unappealing. I'm glad I went because it satisfied my curiosity. But now I know that that frankly, well, I'd only eat here again if it was literally a last resort!",

The worst part which was supposed to be the best part was how the server treated us. Yes I know this is supposed to be a place where the service is supposed to be bad and the server is supposed to be sarcastic and what not but it was worse than that. They have a sign of what the servers are supposed to be and what they won't be, which you'll see at the entrance. Everything they said he wouldn't be, he was. Being vulgar, sexually explicit, rude, mean and nasty. All which are on the \"they will not be\" list. He wrote on those hats some really sexually explicit things that if you were trying to genuinely insult someone they would be funny, but when you're just trying to have fun it shouldn't be said. Because of this place I probably will not step foot in Excalibur again. Hopefully Excalibur can get rid of this place and put a better restaurant in there, until then I won't be going back to that hotel.",

Laugh with them, it's all apart of the show, expect it. Have fun! I had my waitress flick me off and throw straws at me when I asked for some. And you what, I threw them right back at her. They put these paper hats on you with phrases. One guy across from me (who looked latino) had a paper hat that said \"If lost, return to the Home Depot parking lot\". I'm hispanic myself and I found that hilarious. I have dyed red hair so mines said \"The red is fake. The slut is real\". They are that type of funny. I believe Taco is the owner I love him!

I guess If you go with a group and you come here liking the getting treated like crap factor  then that's fine but don't expect much.   They had a live band playing so as we were walking by we decided to go check it out.  We are three 40ish well dressed men walking into a bar.  We all got carded by the Bouncer who was a total jerk.  So now we sit down at a table.  I get up to get a beer.  I'm at the bar maybe two mintues before one of these tee shirt bearing ghetto looking bartenders comes over to get my order.  I was thinking about getting a vodka drink but his attitude totally changed my mind.   I get the fact that this is Dicks and it's the theme of the place.  But there is a way to be rude in a fun way and it almost looked like these guys were using it as an excuse and they never smiled.  So I order the drinks and the guy says three drinks, three ID's.  I pointed to my friends and he said it again more rudely.  I grab them and they show this clown their ID's.  They have to get up after they just sat down.  Then as we were leaving some middle aged ladies were walking in.  One I think walked by the Bouncer somehow and he actually grabber her arm pretty hard.  I couldn't believe it.  Terrible scene.

    "text": "Toilet humor and overpriced drinks  The group of girls that I was with were given 2 for 1 drink vouchers for Dick's so we thought we would kick off our Vegas vacation by drinking. (of course)   We sat at the bar and the bartender start insulting you (you're old/dumb/stuck-up etc). I get it, that's their schtick after awhile it just becomes irritating if you're sober. The bartender just glared at us when we tried to use the vouchers given to us and straight up wouldn't tell me which beers that I could use it with. It was uncomfortable and weird. We should have just left then.  I finally ordered a Newcastle, which was $11(which I guess was one of the acceptable beers on the mystery list) and was told that we couldn't order food without paying for our drinks first. Um ok. Decided not to eat there.  It was dinner time and most of the other patrons there were completely smashed already. It's very loud, people dancing between tables, a drunk lady fell on the floor. There seemed to be a lot of kids running around too.  Our bartender decided to demonstrate \"the shocker\" to the group next to us by dipping his fingers in ketchup and his pinkie in chocolate sauce. We downed our beers and got out. Such a classy place.",

The servers are dicks but at a point it stopped being funny and just became flat out rude, disrespectful, racist. They made a joke about Mexicans and Home Depot and that was distasteful come on. The food is super expensive! I had a steak with mashed potatoes and water, my sister had a shrimp basket (6shrimps and fries) with water and our bill was $50 are you kidding me? Maybe if the food was as good as wood ranch or Lucile's I wouldn't mind but it was full of grease, the fries were old and the server admitted that to us, my steak was all fat and not steak!! There was no flavor to the food it was disgusting I'd rather eat at Applebee's or even McDonald's then come back here.",

She was funny and gave us a good teasing, but she took our teasing back in stride. By the end of our dinner, she was kicking back at our table and laughing with us. Two of us at the table are servers too, so we \"get it\" where others might not.   The hats were hilarious, the drinks were strong, the atmosphere was great. The only con was the food. It was ok.

My buddies and I got the \"Big Ass Burger\" \"Brisket Sammich with pulled pork\" \"bucket of garlic Parmesan fries\" \"a pound of wings\" and topped it off with \"a daiquiri.\" The fries were the best, I'm a huge fan of potatoes and I've always loved my fries at Buffalo Wild Wings but this has topped it. You'll get the potato texture, yes real potatoes, with a light dash of garlic and Parmesan. The brisket Sammich is to die for, I would definitely come back time and time again for it. I'm not sure how the big ass sandwich was but I'm sure it was filling! Wings? Eh I could pass on it and get it elsewhere. The wings weren't the best but they were delicious. I wouldn't be a splurger on it if I had the choice again. The brisket sammich is a must try.",

Ha  Only complaint is the prices, but that's to be expected in Vegas. I got a \"Big Ass\" Newcastle on draft (with a take-home glass) and fish and chips and my tab was $37. Pretty steep for some fried fish and fries. Food and beer were decent, but you go for the funny time. There was also a DJ when we went playing lots of throwback songs with the whole restaurant singing along. Pretty fun time!",

Girlfriend's hat said, \"If dicks had wings, my mouth would be an airport.\" I appreciated the creativity of those. I mean, they aren't the most creative, but they are better than just saying, \"douchebag.\" The server's attitude was great for the place. He was sarcastic but would actually help you. It was all in good fun. Really was expecting the server to be meaner.  The cleanliness of the place was a bit gross though. The table wasn't fully wiped down and it's just dirty everywhere.   The food. You should stick to bar food. Don't go for jumbalaya or anything. Stick to cheeseburgers, chicken wings etc. I got a cheeseburger and it was just fine. Friend got some sort of rice dish and that was not so fine. Getting the server's attention was also a bit of a hassle.   However, Dick's has it right when it comes to some drink specials. I can't remember how big my beer was but it definitely was enough beer to make the food taste better.  Personally, I don't care for the place too much. We went with people from out of town so it was a hoot for them. I can take it or leave it. It's worth a trip down to experience it. That's about it. It's not my favorite restaurant. The food is okay but is overpriced (you are paying for the asshole service). The other diners there are pretty obnoxious. It's like being at a crappy bar full of people who can't hold their liquor and the bar is permanently serving $2 AMF shots. Everyone just yelling, some guy took his shirt off, one lady even slipped and fell earlier and was filing out an incident report. I love seeing trainwrecks but not while I'm eating and waiting to pay.  Give the resort a shot with some friends. Maybe wait for some out of town friends to come in, preferably those who are modest and can take a joke. That's the best time to experience Dick's.",

You get a free plastic cup that I didn't want and forgot to take home, but other than that this place rocked.",

It took 30+ minutes before the waiter even visited to get the food and drink orders in.The food came out pretty quick, most of it at least. 2 people in our group did not get their food. We told the waiter 3 times and still got nothing so we ultimately just canceled the orders. No point in paying for food when everyone else is already finished eating. What got me was that he never apologized, just simply said I took the two orders off the bill. Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I understand the waiters are supposed to be crude, but when the service is that bad the show is off! Worst part was that gratuity was included so we were stuck giving the guy a $30 tip, when he deserved nothing.   The food was not very good. Burgers tasted like a premade patty from a grocery store. Chicken strips were rough and over cooked. The daiquiris looked pretty good, but are very pricy. Thank god beer can't be screwed up or I'm sure it would have been at this place.   Will definitely not be back here.",

Well, I was rolling with a different crowd this time, and after a few nights of going big, we went straight WT for our last supper.  My friend had seen this place on the Food Network and described it as a restaurant where they \"abuse and say mean things to you\". Hmmm, pay someone to abuse me - this should be interesting. Oohh, it was interesting alright - but nothing like I anticipated. Where do I begin....  It's in the Excalibur. I could just stop there. We got to peep the hotel scene in all its glory while waiting in the hour long line (cause this ain't no reservation-takin kinda place, y'all). It's a stand-in-a-roped-off-double-file-line-behind-a-family-of 5-sporting-matching-mullets kinda place. Let's just say - we weren't in Steve Wynn land anymore, toto.   It's is a seedy dive with a chicken-wangish menu, napkins covering the floor, bras hanging from the bar, and servers who create lewd condom/KKK hats and balloon penises. Oh, and they dry hump, sing bad 80's tunes, and make foul sexual comments (all while their 300lb muffin-top is busting out of a thong *see pic*). It's a low-budget (questionable taste), Vegas-bachelorette-party-paradise.   I sat back and enjoyed the shit show for what is was - but there is no chance in hell you'll catch me there again.",

After walking for a few hours, we wound up here by chance and it was the best meal of the week.  Not so much for the food but for the great service and laughs we got throughout the meal.  The food offers the standard and traditional fare of sandwiches, burgers, BBQ, and the like.  The BBQ was pretty good and the Mac N Cheese was quite yummy amongst the sides.  The HUMOR THOUGH was priceless.  We weren't in on the joke about Dick's Last Resort but we knew we were in for something special.  After a brusque welcome and a number of sarcastic shout outs, my husband was fired up and joined in the fun.  Since the seating is like being in a picnic, you are thrust into some situations where the diners start ripping into you (a trio to our immediate right) or a couple leaving (a duo striving for a romantic evening) to the trio's right.  As the meal continued, and the waiters get a sense for their customers, hats appear with funny and inflammatory missives.  I really appreciate the attentive (and savage diatribes at times) service.  We felt comfortable in the unpretentious atmosphere.  Dick's Last Resort doesn't try to be something that it is not...what it is, is simply the natural order of things.",

Upon leaving the people who took our seats came up to us to let us know their disappointment for not leaving a tip.  WHAT?  The waiter told them that we stiffed him.  First, this was unTrue as we left cash in the check wallet and secondly, why not be a man and approach us yourself instead of whining to the next table.  Just came off as extremely unprofessional.

We ended up staying. The food was okay tasting but overpriced. My wrap was ok but my husband's burrito was not good. Here's the clincher: the alcohol! Four drinks plus five lunch orders came to $200! An extra shot in one of the mixed drinks cost us $20! It was a mediocre experience at best. I would have been unhappy if the bill was $100 but when we got it I nearly fainted.

I don't mind doing it, as the server threw it at us and demanded that we get to work, it's all part of the fun! It was just the time in-between interactions was way, way too long.   We eventually all got paper hats with roasts on them and had a blast interacting with the the table next to us. We actually had more fun with them, than our server. He did help my friend find the bathroom, which feels like it's in the casino next door it's so far away. He literally walked her all the way there, which was really nice.   Yes, our group is a little rowdy. I will be the first to admit that but we came here because they seem to encourage that.    The food was just alright. I had the apple pecan chicky salad and it was pretty good but nothing to write home about. It wasnt over-dressed, which was nice.  They put really strong olives in my friends steakhouse chopped salad, she had a tough time eating it. The mozzarella sticks were incredibly bland.   I might try them again but this visit was just ok.",

Highlight of the experience.   I was honestly hoping for something more... yes maybe more sarcasm. The waitress who attended to us didn't really seem to be having to much fun with us as we saw other waiters being with other customers. Trust me, we wanted the full on experience!!! The hats they give you with a crazy comment is hilarious!! Other than that it's hard to rate service... lol.  The food was better than expected! I ordered the full rack of ribs which was good, just needed the extra bbq (which I asked for). My friends ordered their chicken pasta which was very tasty! Wished I had ordered it. Frozen drinks were ordered with an extra $2 shot and let me tell you, you definitely tasted the alcohol!  I'll definitely be trying out Dicks again, maybe in another city!",

The food is decently priced (for the Strip) with a meal costing around $20 per person (not including alcohol). The full rack of ribs is huge and enough food to split with a friend, which would bring the cost down to around $15 a person.   Also, note that this place is unique in that the servers are expected to have attitude. You WILL be insulted. It never crosses the line, but if you go into it knowing what to expect you'll have a great time.   Two thumbs way up!",

This was a lunchtime roast and the waiter got most things right, calling out one lesbian, one guy who wasn't getting any action and a few older folks jokes. It was everything we had expected to happen and most of us will remember (or forget) it forever.      So, the various versions of mac and cheese were all pretty good. Those twisty noodles and long strips of flavorful chicken elevated this dish to a good level. The guy getting no action also enjoyed his fish and chips. Personally, I had a liquid lunch with a giant margarita for $16 - True tourist stuff. Enjoy the show.",

When we were ordering food the server wouldn't let our friends that arrived alittle late order food. So they went the night without food.   The food is absolutely overpriced for what you get. Honestly could have gotten better food at McDonald's.

He also reviewed how food could be prepared separately to reduce cross contamination. All their foods are fried together, there is not a dedicated fryer for french fries. Fries are also lightly breaded. When we arrived, he came to table and provided the allergen list for all starters and entrees. Went with rib eye, rice and green beans. Food was good.

Oh not to mention they charged for the water! Seriously? People come here for the big paper hats and to be treated rudely and just have a good time laughing.  We did enjoy our visit here, my friend probably a bit more since she had 3 heavily poured cocktails that were buy one get one free in the bar before we were seated and she brought the fourth to drink with dinner. Don't come here if you are sensitive to name calling or profanity it will not be your kinda place! But if you want to have a good time and joke around with friends and enjoy a meal with a lot of sexual innuendos thrown in then come check them out.  They are located in the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the back on the right and if we weren't staying at the hotel I would have never seen this place or known it was here.

The waiter was so funny with his sarcastic comments. They make hats for you to wear and they can get a bit raunchy but we were up for that. This place is for those that have a good sense of humor be can laugh at themselves as well as others. Food wise it was just average but I would go back simply because of how funny it was.",

They also gave us those funny paper hats! Had such a good time here with all my friends.. The reason I give it 3 stars tho is because it is pretty pricey and there's not too much of a variety for food. I also ordered a Coronita margarita and it cost me $27!!!!!!!!!!!! Wtfffff !!! Double the price of my meal...:/ even if the cup is a souvenir, I still don't think it should be priced at $27! If I would have known it was gonna cost that much I wouldn't have got it.  I had a breakfast burrito which wasn't that bad but wasn't worth the price  All in all... You pay for the entertainment of getting shit talked to your face and having a good laugh... I had a good time! Nothing in Vegas is cheap so it's ok.",

    "text": "I can't really figure out how to explain how awful our experience at Dicks was.  I have never been so disappointed in my life. I've been wanting to check out Dicks for a long time but never had the chance while I was in Vegas.  I'll just go over the major awful points.  There will not be a good point section because there are no good points that go along with the story.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Hands down the worst.  The place was pretty full (not 100% full) - I've seen it busier.  I asked the hostess if they had any tables available and was told no but that I can sit at the bar if we like.  I asked her if the experience was still the same - she told me that everyone still gets picked on and gets the funny hat and the experience they pay for.  With her assurance I accepted a seat at the bar for my mother and I.    Our blonde waitress was also the bar tender.  She was not super friendly at first but she also wasn't horrible.  She got our drinks and took our food orders in a semi-efficient manner and that was that.  We were left in the corner of the bar with another group of patrons to eat our food and watch the entire restaurant have a great time with the staff while we were ignored.  Several other waiters walked by us but didn't even bother saying Hi.    Towards the end of our dining experience (over an HOUR) into it.  We asked about the hats.  The bar tender/waitress got really mad and told me she \"is very busy and doesn't have time to deal with hats\" and walked away.  WOW.  For the first time in my life I left a big fat $0.00 on the tip line.  FOOD: Not awesome or unique or even flavorful in anyway.  My mother got the fish and chips which were soggy and a bit cold and I got a burger which tasted like any other burger, in any other restaurant in the country.  My 1st bottled beer was not ice cold.  The 2nd one (draft in a Dicks cup) was better and my mother's Huge margarita was good.  I would not willingly pay for the food again.  ATMOSPHERE:  Its horribly loud.  I expected it to be loud.  But it was so loud that I had to yell in my mom's ear while sitting right next to her to have any kind of conversation.  If I had a fun waiter and we were getting fun hats and I was tipsy and fun then I would have loved the atmosphere.  But none of those things happened.  VALUE: Do I even have to talk about this?  In the end we paid $72.00 for a bland burger, soggy fish and chips, two beers and a margarita.  You walk into a place like this and expect to pay big time for what the place has to offer that is unique. We didn't get any of that.  I will never go back and will never recommend this place to anyone else.  It will actually even push me from staying at the Excalibur because I like to eat where I am staying at least one day during my Vegas vacations.  STAY AWAY and spend your money elsewhere.  I told the hostess about the problems we had afterwards.  She didn't apologize and didn't even ask if we wanted to talk to a manager.  Nice.",

We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer. They were alright...seemed to be sliced really thin and very dried out. Not enough pickle flavor.  I ordered the Dick's Big Pig which was a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries. The sandwich was really fatty instead of meaty, but would have tasted better with more BBQ sauce....was kind of dry.  The fries were nice and crispy.  My bf ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. He said it was like \"a drunk man's philly. Someone just threw some meat and veggies on a hot dog bun with slices of cheese and nuked it in the microwave.....but it was edible.\"   You really only go here for the experience, which is why we rated it at a 4, because the service is fun.",

    "text": "Experience:  well, it's was my Birthday!!!  I decided since I can't drink this birthday, I'm going to go somewhere fun. I had been here once many years ago in San Antonio and had a blast, so thought it would be cool to try again.   Facility: it's located inside Excalibur Casino and easy to get to from Valet.  Also learned Valet is best when coming South on Tropicana. It is a fun place that is completely open to the Casino. That part can be awkward with so many walking by watching you be humiliated...at least the Birthday girl was.  LOL!  Tables and chairs for those interested.  Didn't see any booth seating, but there was high seat bar seating.   Service:  ok, there was some good and some ok, and some not so good.  Good = Emily, who helped me set up my party. She is always available, and answered every question. She was awesome at getting me exactly what I wanted at my birthday.  Hostesses at the door, not my favorite. Brook the manager, jumped right in and made me feel very welcomed, he also fixed any issues I had.  Waitress, she was cool, but not very funny. Oh well, she was still a cool chic. Now, Taco was my fav part.  And not just because he gave me a lap dance. That man hilarious!  But he was just such a fun guy.  Yall better keep him!!!  Food:  this is the reasoning for marking the review down.  We had the bachelorette package, so we had nachos and apps to start and small meals to choose from for a set price.  It also included Jell-O shots and a large frozen drink for the bday girl. :) Nachos - 3/5 decent. I didn't eat much though...just like 2 bites.   Appetizer tray - 3/5 nice section of mozzarella sticks, hot wings, chicken strips and fried pickles.  My fav were the fried pickles. I ate a bunch of these.  Now, of the plate see could chose from, I got the fried shrimp (2.5/5) on the waitresses suggestion, but man do I wish I would have gotten the brisket (4/5).  I tried one bite of my friend's, and it was yum!  This is not brisket for those that like it lean, but those like me who enjoy some fat on it.  Wish I would have chosen that!!!! Oh well.  The other mark down was the bill. They put it all on one.  What a mess!!!!  Overall: what a fun place to have a get together!  Probably won't do it for a few more years, and won't do it again until I can drink, but I still had a great birthday thanks to Emily!!!  And thanks Brook, and especially my new boyfriend Taco!!!  Well, he did tell me he loved me! ;)",

    "text": "Before we begin, let me go on the record and say that this review is for the patio bar - not inside the place.  Dick's Last Resort - Dick's, Dick's, Dick's...Here's the thing - if you're easily offended, just don't go. The gimmick here is in the name - the staff act like dicks. They're rude, sarcastic, will flip you off and insult you regardless of age or gender. If you take stuff like that personally, just don't go. If you don't have a sense of humor - don't go. It's funny, irreverent, loaded with innuendo, and just...disrespectful. If you want standard service go somewhere else. If you want to get dickslapped, go to Dick's. On to the review - the food here is pretty good for strip fare - I've had the pulled pork sandwich and tried the fried catfish and enjoyed both. The pulled pork sandwich was served with fries and was actually pretty daggone good. It's also slightly cheaper than their other sandwiches. The fried catfish here is the shiznaz! I honestly have to say this is about the best fried kittyfishy I've ever had, and I've spent my life in both Texas and Georgia so I've had a LOT of catfish. It's about $15 which is not a bad price for it, the fillets are big, the tartar sauce is good, and it's not greasy at all. The beer is cold and tasty, which is always a good thing. Beer which is warm and tasteless is swill (or being served in England)  and I flat refuse. If you order a tall beer (or have a friend who does anyway) you can keep the glass too (although it's usually made of plastic). The main draw for me, though, week after week, is karaoke on the patio on Saturday and Sunday from 2 - 6, weather permitting. The queue is short, the selection vast, and the host is very good. Also, draughts and pitchers are 2 for 1, plus $5 shots of Jack or Jaeger during karaoke. If you like to sing, drink, or do both (like me) then go. If you have little ones, they can actually go with you. I actually saw the bartender put one of those paper hats they make on a 12 year old mentioning something about riding the short bus...laughed my ass off. Bottom line - decent food and during karaoke decent drink specials.  Update - the burgers are quite good too.",

The food is just whatever nothing too great, muuust try the fried catfish it's pretty good. =)  So anyways, me and a my girlfriends went to this place for lunch/dinner and I was expecting something totally different, but it was so much fun. I guess there was a birthday the night we went and the security guy/MC was going to give the lucky birthday boy a lap dance. It was THE funniest thing in the WORLD! All I can say is SUPERMANNNNN! =)   Well anyways, you get these paper hats and they write really evil things on it...I was sad....  The girl sitting next to me had a hat that said \"Herpes Infested Slut\" and an arrow pointing at me...Then I get my hat and all my friends' mouths drop. I ask them what it says and this is what they read \"My Meat Curtain is like a stinky pinata waiting to get beat\" I was offended, because all my friends had something stupid like, \"some girls spit, some girls, swallow, I gargle\"...i would totally wear that rather then what I had to wear...jeeeez, so I was a herpes infested slut who had stinky pinata like meat curtains that was waiting to get beat.   hahahhahaha. Our waiter was cool and not that rude =)  We had a LOT of fun!! I would totally recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Vegas and wanting to eat at fun place with their friends.

We sat down, the server came over and threw a paper table cover at us.  We adjusted it and began looking at the menu.  Looking around the portions seemed large, so we decided to share.  After the server took our order, he gave me a hat and then brought my Mom one.  Once they threw the plates down and walked away, we realized there was no BBQ sauce on the brisket but we couldn't catch the server's attention to ask for more.  When he did come by, I asked where the hats were for the other 2 people at our table and he yelled, \"don't tell me how to do my job\" and walked away.  Never received any refills on our drinks or anything else at our table.  In fact, I had to find forks for us in order to eat.  The bill came out with a note \"suck it\" and the server asked us to leave a big tip.  Then he proceeded to advise we had to leave cash because their credit machine was down.  I understand the place is called Dick's and I understand it's supposed to be fun and obnoxious.  But we had horrible service.  The food was good.  We only left a 15% tip.  With all the places to go in Vegas, I would probably wouldn't go back.",

If waitresses shoving your face in their tits and men performing a water spectacular isn't you're kind of entertainment then this might not be the place for you. Great service isn't exactly their motto however it does remind me of being at your buds house and just \"dickin'\" around. Not meant to be your slave and hand you napkins and a menu. In Dick's words you get it and do it your damn self. The food is tasty. I had a \"Big Ass Burger.\" There's not much variety (although what is there is delicious ) on the menu but you really do eat there for the experience.

The people are complete jerks on purpose :-) they make it a lot of fun. If you go in with a few drinks in you, even better! I always get the burger so I don't have to ask for any utensils.

They have a Daiquiri bar similar to the slurpee machine at seven eleven which was completely epic.   The premise of the restaurant is for the servers to treat you like garbage so if you've got thick skin, this is the place for you. It's pretty silly but I can definitely see people taking it the wrong way.   On top of that they have great food! I had the best burger of my life there!  It is a tad bit pricey but what in Vegas isn't?   I saw someone take their kids in here.. would not suggest that.. kinda awkward.",

Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed all these people wearing paper hats with writing on them.  Some of the things that I can remember:  \"The blonde is fake, but the slutty is real\" \"Cougar looking for fresh meat\" \"I swallow\"  There were 3 people in our party and they put us at a shared table with 3 others.  It worked out well for us because the other party was so wild that we didn't have to take the brunt of any of the jokes; we just sat back and watched the others take all the abuse.  The food was decent, but expensive.  Though, I guess that tends to be the theme at Vegas restaurants unless you go really high-end.  The drinks were smaller than their prices would suggest.  Overall, it was a pretty fun night, but it's the kind of place that I can say, \"been there, done that\" and I don't really feel the need to go back.",

    "text": "I had the best time at Dick's Last Resort. We were seated in under 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. Not because the place was empty. As a matter of fact, it was very full. We were seated quickly because of the amount of seating available. Believe me when I tell you, there is a lot of seating. The decor is very flashy. Not in a gaudy way, but in a fun have a good time way. There was a man making the most incredible balloon creations I have ever seen. And he made them each so quickly. They were not all animals so I cannot say he was making balloon animals. They were balloon creations. He made a seahorse and a little puppy, but he also made a little mermaid. I was and still am impressed. Dick's is a theme restaurant. The theme is service with an attitude. Our waiter seemed like he was trying to do his part of being rude. But it did not seem rude so much. He did make sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there.  I ordered a Big A__ Burger with cheese and bacon. The burger was a half pounder, was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor. The bacon was the same. Juicy, not to crisp, and flavorful. The bun was very light and flaky making it a perfect burger. I have to be honest and say that the fries were not the best I have ever had. But, the fries were crisped just right and had a very good flavor to them as well. For not the best they were pretty darned good. My wife had the Steak Sammich. I did not taste it, but she said it was very good.  I am looking forward to going back to Dick's. I can't wait to try the tri-tip, brisket, ribs, pork and other items on the menu.",

Just a cover band covering old school music like guns and roses, and the like, but it was so well done that it was hard to take your eyes off of them.  Honestly would not have come here if it was not for the great music. This place gets 3 stars because the place was lame 1 star, the music was rockin' 4/5 stars.  If the band is not great, this place is not a note worthy stop, in my opinion .",

We didn't really stay for the \"goings on\" in the actual resturant/bar part, but I'd have to say that our drinks were really really good.  We took our drinks happily and began wandering around.  I'm not sure if I liked this place because of the fun we had with our drinks.  But I'd go again, just for my giant frozen margarita in a huge glass.  Hehe.",

Immediately conveying that I was merely an inconvenience in her busy day was a horrible first impression. The bar & restaurant wasn't even full at the time, a weeknight around 7pm. Not that this would have even been a justification. This person conveyed that they barely cared that I had just entered the business.  She came back and reviewed our ID's, I ordered my one beer, and the mrs said she just wanted to drink water. The beverages were brought back, and I offered money immediately, without asking the cost. I got my change back, and discovered by looking at the receipt that they charge 75 cents for a glass of water. Seriously. I was a bit stunned. I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.",

Went to Dick Last Resort with a group of friends, we had to wait for everyone to show up before we were seated, and while waiting we got to look at our table LOL but it was ok     Our waiter was rude and offered no explanations of menu lol but that was ok, asked if we could split the check he said F**K no, we all just said ok.  Our cups and flatware where tossed at us. Insults where flying but feel free to toss some back, due to the nature of things posted on hats & the flying insults I would keep kids under 15 out of here.   Some of us got hats to wear that have insults posted on it. Some could be mild and some out there, saw the dude at the table across from us and his hat said my penis is so small I pee on my nuts,,,I could not stop laughing and neither could some of my friends, needless to say the guy took his hat off LOL Other hats in the group were just as funny and rude.  I ordered the Its A Wrap and have to say it was very good, turkey with apple smoked bacon and it had some fries. The menu itself is posted in 3 spots in the place and it is limited and mostly sandwiches, burgers, and finger foods.  But everything everyone ordered looked great!  At the end of the meal we tallied up our monies and most was cash and rest on one card. The waiter told us what is the exact about  to be charged on the card, we told him how much cash we had and charge the rest, he was being bitchy and said if you can't tell me I'm  charging the entire meal to the card. Guess the dude couldn't add or subtract LOL    Over all it was fun place and I would go back again.",

    "text": "\"Hs not small, hs fun-size\".  That was the hat our server made me, torn in half-since I'm all fun-size.  Yes, she spelled that incorrectly, twice....but if I mentioned it, she'd probably tell me to fuck off, since I'm at Dick's.  Standard fried goodies, burgers, steaks and a couple salads.  Borderline rude-obnoxious servers literally throwing silverware and straws on your park bench table you'll most likely share with new friends (for a little while, anyway).  I had the steak and shrimp for $20 and a Coors Light for $5.  Steak was actually very tender and the cocktail sauce for the shrimp had a nice little spicy zip.  One of our group had the porterhouse and someone had the big ass burger.  Issue we had was that three dinners, two small beers, two Maker's Marks and three 50oz. beers came to $185.  After some number crunching, we discovered that the server took the liberty of giving herself an 18% tip and that the 50's were $17.  Course my share of the bill (tax/tip/etc) should have been $30, but the guy in our group with the burger didn't chip in enough, so I got to make up the difference.  Yes, yes...I know.  This specifically doesn't reflect on Dick's but is the main reason why I hate dining with groups.  The \"sing along or we play bad songs\" gimmick was fun, as well as reading each others hats.  Winners include: a gal that just got married (\"I'm married, I don't have to give blowjobs anymore\") and one of our guys in our group (\"I'm the reason some women become lesbians\").  The rotund gentleman wearing a thong and giving lap dances was disturbing.  The staff will kind of lay off the language around small children, but if you're into the rude-surly attitude, so-so food and singing along to Journey while you're trying to enjoy a steak, welcome to Vegas.",

We were seated right away so that's good but that has more to do with the fact that they weren't busy than their service.  I went there anticipating to get insulted and offended and all that good stuff but (I can't believe I'm saying this) our server was not insulting enough. What I mean by this is he didn't come by to insult us enough.   The table next to us and behind us who ordered around the same time as us finished their meals before we even got our food. I understand that may be because we had a fairly big party (there was 8 of us) but that's really not an excuse. We also waited over 10 minutes just to get our drinks (water) -___-. Besides that, everyone else had actual glasses while we had plastic cups. What's up with that?  Ohhh! if you're walking around, wondering where people get their tall white paper hats, Dick's Last Resort gives them out to their customers. Haha. I was wondering about that.",

The food is great and the drinks are awesome. And whatever drink you buy, you keep the cup and can use it for refills when you come back to the bar for a discounted price. In all I must say I had a great time. Their humor is a little dirty but as I said, it's all in fun. Great food, great drinks, and great laughs, who could ask for more. Located in the Excalibur Hotel  this is a great place to have a good time. Can't wait to visit again.",

    "text": "*5 plus stars if you are open minded, do not embarrass easy and want to have some hearty good laughs. This is a definite \"Stays in Vegas\" experience.   Spoiler alert to follow***************Please do not read unless you know about this place or like to be surprised.   *No stars if you are easily offended or have kids- do not go   *Two and a half stars for the food. lol-- I don't think folks go here for the food. We do not remember what the food tasted like.  Brawhaha  *Drinks look good. We did not have any so no opinion on that but I hear they are awesome and have great specials.   I averaged it out to a 4 star review because it was highly entertaining after we got used to it of course. ;)     We had no idea when we came in why all the servers kept walking past us and refusing to sit us. They continued to ignore us. Then someone came by, looked at us ignored us and then sat the folks last in line. Even they were aghast and murmured a quick, \"sorry\" to us. We asked to be given a table adding, \"We have been here a while.\" The guy threw the menus at us and said, \"Oh ya have have ya? Give me a break. Sit yourselves.\" We were like, \" WTH?\"  We were appalled but somehow I recognized something in a fellow actor. Maybe, it was the twinkle in his eye. So before I strangled him and demanded to see his manager, I poked my head into the restaurant to see what was up. Rude caveman sighs, loudly I might add, and begrudgingly walks us to our table. He asked if we had ever heard of the place or been in. When we said, \"no\" this is when all hell broke loose.  The \"stupid\" word was used, He yelled as he walked us to our table \" Coming through with some Moronic Newbies.\"  napkins were thrown at us, food passed by with phallic symbols on it, eye rolls of impatience and sympathy from the fellow staffers, etc and so forth. We sat there for about 2 minutes with our jaws on the table before we finally got the fact it was suppose to be this way. Then we rolled on the floor laughing. Of course this just gets the waiter even more annoyed with how silly and dumb we were. lol--- Thank God I am not a prude or embarrassed easily. To be honest I was embarrassed anyway. My friend starts to really get into it and I have to remind her she is a wife, mother, and grandmother so sit the heck down and behave. This is when we noticed the equally offensive slogans, posters hanging around on the walls, the waiter made hats on the fellow customers, and songs being sung for birthday patrons. \"My Dearie Goody Two Shoes Ears!\" YIKESAROONI!  So as you have gathered by now it is a themed restaurant where they purposely treat you nasty/saracastic/rude/raunchy etc. It gets dirty though so please do not bring kids here. There were tons here when we were there and that really bothered me since there is no warning sign out front. Also,do not go if you are offended by that sort of thing.  What was really fun was whenever a new person comes in. People sit here all day to watch their confused faces, like ours, before they get the joke. It is like the customers are the audience and you are the new actors on stage. When the group of four 80 plus year old's came in and sat next to us we could not control our laughter over their confused and outraged faces. My friend and I were laughing so hard that helped them catch on and finally figured it out. It is an interesting human psychology experiment to watch. Human nature at it's best. Go Gramps and Grams because they were getting into it too! After eating We never wanted to leave the place. We were having so much fun.  Oh to review the food, what food? Don't ask us about the food. We honestly have no idea because we do not remember. We do remember the food and restaurant is beach themed if that helps.  We finally got up to leave after an hour and the manager says, So how was everything?\" Before we could answer he says, \"Well it had better have been good. You took long enough. Your friend there was all over my man server. Now get the hell out of my place.\" Brawhahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!! We'll be back next week. JK or are we?",

I was there this past weekend with a group of 4 girls (for a 21st birthday celebration). We all agreed that this would be a good place to go with more people. Our waiter was good - he had fun sexually harassing us most of the evening.  You will notice right away that the servers make hats that have obscene remarks written on them for their patrons to wear. At first I wasn't happy about the thought of having to wear a paper hat all night, but once we got in there I didn't mind at all! At my table they read as follows: My hat said \"Ask me about my chlamydia.\"  The birthday girl's said \"all I got for my birthday was my period.\"  Danielle's hat said \"I HEART ANAL.\" and finally Bree got \"My vagina is a gaping hole of disappointment\" (this last one I thought was a little harsh, but whatever)!  The food at Dick's is very average, but they bring it out quickly after you order and they make strong drinks ---so we were satisfied!",

When we came back that evening though, the bartender was spending so much time with a patron across the bar and taking selfies for her, that he flat out ignored others at the bar. When we finally got his attention, he tried to overcharge us for our drinks. We did have to ask him about it, and this is where it draws the line between funny crude joking to flat out being a True dick. The bartender didn't know the difference at that point and was literally being a jerk. We did call him on his attitude knowing we could be misinterpreting it, but he had a totally jerk ass response and validated that he was being rude. We didn't deserve this. We paid, but left without tipping. He went back to flirting.   I would have expected better from the bartender (even mediocre service) being that this place is a tourist location.",

However, when you NEVER get refills, take twenty minutes to get a drink order taken, the food is overpriced and comes out COLD and the server NEVER returns ever...there is an issue. I get rudeness,( I get snarky with my tables all the time, in a fun way) but not at the expense of doing your job.   I have always wanted to try this place, and was very excited. After this I am deciding this is a place where those servers who couldn't handle a real station at a real restaurant went to get jobs..being rude and a smartass is part of the fun, neglecting your customers is not. What a disappointment.",

Nonetheless, it did not disappoint. The staff are crack-ups! They make you these paper hats with some hilarious sayings on them...(My friends and I made our own hats though and by the end of the night, we were even getting hat requests from the bartenders!!!) Every once in a while the staff would throw  thousands of paper napkins on the ground...then use a blower to kindly corral them onto your table. They also had a character roaming around the place named \"Taco\", who was giving lap dances to the ladies. He was a far-from-attractive guy, somewhat heavy-set, with a tattoo on his stomach that said \"Taco\". Pretty entertaining. The atmosphere was cool, the bartenders were full of sarcasm and great service. Gotta check this place out for yourself...I'll definitely go back!",

    "text": "You're supposed to watch a little bit longer on your waiters. You better rattle off your whole order right away when they ask, \"What do you want, assholes?\" You may or may not get a paper hat saying, \"You've taken more packages than UPS\"..and yes, drink prices are strip drink prices.  We asked the hostess for a table for 4 and she told me to hold on while she danced the rest of the song, ignoring us but sat us after a minute.  But its a fun atmosphere if you come with the right frame of mind. The food isn't too bad, my brisket sandwich was overflowing with BBQ sauce and meat and I wanted a fork, but my waiter said I could stop being a pansy and eat with my fingers. When asked for a glass of water, he said that we're in the middle of the desert and that the water was being saved for Taco's water show. Bottom line though our drinks and food came out pretty fast and there weren't any complaints. At a table next to us, a mom had brought her kids with her. She was wearing a paper hat with 'MILF' written across it by the waiter. She wasn't aware of what it meant.  Our waiter said if we didn't tell her, he wouldn't bring us our drinks. I don't think I'll ever see teenage boys' faces be any redder than they were. We let her know and she was pretty red in the face too. Good times. Parents should have Urban Dictionary saved on their websites to keep up with the times, though cmon...everyone knows what a MILF is.  Ah, Taco. The man that makes this joint run. He'll give bachelorettes a lap dance while he sports a thong hanging out of his pants. Too hot to handle!! He popped in a Grease sing-a-long DVD and made his own commentary that was pretty entertaining, along with making old men dance with the videos for free drinks. But his crowning achievement is his water show. A spin off the Bellagio fountains, I won't give anything away but you'll be laughing your ass off by the time its over.  Base humor and crude jokes run rampant so if you have a stick in your ass, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "We visited Dick's Last Resort about a year ago.  It was recommended to me by a friend who said it was a real hoot.  When we arrived there wasn't a wait, but they sat us at the side of the restaurant where you cannot see the stage & the main crowd of people - that kind of sucked because you could hear people laughing and carrying on, but you were not able to be a part of it.  It is the waiter's job to yell at you, call you names, and place silly paper hats with silly sayings on your head.  Of the 4 of us in our group, they chose me for one of their hats.  Mine read, \"I have a crush on Dr. Phil\".  Everytime the waiters pass your table by, they hurl insults at everyone & heaven forbid you should need something & ask for it.  They do bring it to you, but be prepared to have it thrown at you along with a hurling insult.  I ordered the hamburger and I thought it was quite good.  The whole concept of Dick's is pretty neat, but i think for us it was as much fun as it could have been because they sat us off to the side of the restaurant while everyone else was in the middle, near the stage.  Maybe because of our ages?  I don't care if I'm 90, I would want to be where all the fun is.  As far as prices go, I guess you just need to expect it, after all you are in Vegas and since the mob no longer runs it, corporate America does, you can forget excellent food deals.",

But then we realized that we came thru the wrong entrance and the hostess were on the other side. So when we went to the hostess they told us to sit at this long table that had another group on the end. There were different wooden seats at the tables that said different phrases like \"Property of Dicks\" and \"Im with Stupid\". The waiter came and pointed to the menu that was written with chalk on a board on the wall across from us. He then said \"I know you probably cant see it, so get ur ass up to go read it\". So we did LOL. He also handed us a drink menu. My friend and I order the big appetizer platter to share, she was satified with it, but I was still hungry :( The food was good tho, but not above average. We each ordered a drink, I actually dont remembered what I ordered but it tasted good but it was also suprisingly strong. They served the drinks in these cheap little plastic cups.  The waiter was cute and funny. He wasnt really mean to us, he just had a lot of sexual humor and kind of flirted with us. He made us these paper hats and put them on our heads. Mine said \"Flava Flave is my baby daddy\" and my friend's said \"I love anal\". I asked the waiter to take a pic with me and he took grabbed my leg and put it around him when we took the pic. Then my friend responded \"her husband wouldnt like that\" (disclaimer: I'm not really married, it was a joke). The waiter said, well how bout this, then he took off his shirt, bent me over and flipped the camera off. So all in all we had a good time, and I was tipsy by the time I left...smh...",

So we sat at the bar and ordered nachos and the \"big ass burger.\"  The nachos were ok and the burger was pretty good too, considering I was starving!  We ordered drinks from this obnoxious bartender and eventually more drinks started flowing (this is where my 3rd star comes in).  My sister and I got tipsy and everything started being funny.  We were made silly/perverted paper hats, mine appropriately saying, \"I don't sing but I do suck.\"  lol.  Then my sister got a lap dance from some big-bellied dude with a tatt that said, \"TACO.\"  This guy was wearing a thong too!  That was funny yet disturbing to watch!

The hotel sends out this guy (totally cool dude Justin) to hand out little coupons good for a free Jello shot or a 2-for-1 beer, obviously trying to get people to go visit, for a reason.  The venue itself isn't all that bad.  Looks like a pretty decent-sized dive bar full with a bunch of bench seating and a stage where they can host various bands.  The problem isn't with the venue, it's with the staff.  The 2 female bartenders and that one male bar-back obviously didn't like being there at all.  They weren't rude to me, but they were rude to my friends.  Sure everyone can have a bad day... but 3 days in a row?  Geesh they need to find a more suitable job for their own sake.  Looks like a good place for Bachelorette parties... must have seen 8 of them going through the 3 days I was there.  Various used bras hanging from the bar was a nice touch.  :)",

The atmosphere is a great time and \"Taco\" (their main attraction: an entertaining fellow), will definitely get you chuckling, as he frequently pulls randoms in for lap dances (men and women alike), and sports a red thong.  The main concept is that the people working there are \"dicks\" to you, ie, they will harass and insult you, but it's all in good fun, you can dish it right back.    I would suggest going with a group for the most fun, but its a good place for drinking with friends and grabbing some food.  The prices for food may not be the most competitive (around $15 for chicken tenders--although delish), you are mostly paying for a fun atmosphere.    Good times, every time.   Toodles",

For starters, I didn't love the anti-smoking policy. There were ashtrays everywhere just like there are everywhere else in Vegas. Apparently those are just decorations, though, and you have to stand outside the door to smoke a cigarette. I don't mind traveling to smoke, but it's beyond dickish to taunt smokers with ashtrays that can't be used.  I also wasn't thrilled with the overall fun level at the Vegas Dick's. I went there on a Friday night and there was hardly anyone there. Our waiter didn't insult us, make fools of us, or even acknowledge us. That would normally be a good thing, but that's part of the fun you usually get to have at Dick's.   Even though we were robbed of our consumer right to be mistreated, the Vegas Dick's gets brownie points for their awesome drinks. I had a 100 ounce slush chock full of grain alcohol in the coolest container ever. While others were walking around with Dick Sticks around their necks, I got to rock my drink with a plastic guitar around my shoulder. I always wanted my own personal drinking riff, so my rockin' guitar made up for a lot of Dick's shortcomings.",

They serve the chicken pasta that I used to love, that they no longer serve in SD.  Bonus points for that alone.  I also loved my Sweet Potato Fries.  My husband had the Steak and Eggs (at 4pm, oh yeah!), and he said the eggs were egg-cellent (hardy-har-har!) and the steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare).  Prices were pretty reasonable (for Vegas), and laughs were plentiful.  We had a great time here.  You have to be prepared for the crude-ness and the Dick's schtick.  I'm well versed in it, so it's all good by me.",

I heard them using the same phrases with every table. We came during slow hours, so we got our food relatively quickly.  Even for a place off the strip, I found it to be a little overpriced for the quality. The menu items range from $16-25, portions are good, but food was not spectacular. I understand that food in Vegas will be pricey regardless, but they could have done a better job.  Overall a decent experience, but I would rather try out a new restaurant next time.",

For four of us, we ordered Parmesan fries (cold & greasy), chicken nachos (small plate which is unusual for a Mexican dish) and a burger.  2 drink coupons were two for one and a second round of drinks...total bill $118!!  I thought for sure this was a misprint.  I am never returning here.  There are so many other amazing restaurants nearby where I gladly could have spent that $100 and been satisfied.  I'm still thinking about the $19 patty melt I had the night before at Citizens in Mandalay Bay.  That sandwich was fantastic!!  Go to Citizens people! You can thank me later.",

They have some delicious burgers here, but if you're here to get anything more sophisticated than that you best look elsewhere. Expect the waiters to be utterly rude and you to have an insulting hat about your gender, your sexual preference, your baldness or your fob-ness. There is no end to the jokes in this place and you just have to be a good sport about it if you come here.  This is not for the light hearted!",

    "text": "This review is based on nothing but sitting at the bar drinking, or getting refills from the walk-up bar.  They have sports on in the secondary bar where I sat watching football while working on my buzz.  I got to witness all the servers and bartenders making fun of people, wisecracking, making silly paper hats for everyone with sayings on them like 'Yes, Yes, I'm a slut.' or 'I give the best head ever!'.  Then of course the 11 year old wearing the questionable hat with the saying 'I'm living proof the pill is only 99 percent effective!'  What I didn't really care for was the little kid that looked like a 2 year old having her balloon popped next to her ear when she was not expecting it which started her crying.  Then the guy came back and gave her another balloon and said 'don't worry I won't pop this balloon' then less than 30 seconds later he cut the tie on the balloon sending it floating to the ceiling which started her crying again and then guess what?? Yeah the balloon popped.  Anyways the family seemed to be laughing about it even with the kid crying.  I didn't get it.  The kid still had a face full of tears 30 to 45 minutes later when the family all left.  That didn't seem like fun.  But really none of my business.  I wouldn't bring kids here, it's not their kind of place.  But if you like smack-talking wait-staff, rude and obnoxious behavior, including birthday mandances for the women-folk, which I warn, has some full face contact involved, and that type of service gimmick, you might enjoy this place.  I really did enjoy the show, but I didn't have to participate.   Mmmm, and the drinks went down so good.....",

Somehow Dicks Last Resort reeled me in. Their food is decent. Better than fast food but too $$ for the quality they provide. I had hot wing chicken tenders which were hot, made of chicken, and cooked well. Enough said...   The waitstaff is rude but that's their gimmick. Sometimes they'll put an innuendo laden sign upon your head. I think that's just silly. They'll try to embarrass you. That pisses some people off to the point of leaving. Eh... It is what is... An experience. But it comes with the hefty Vegas price tag.",

I say \"thing\" because I'm 99% sure it wasn't even beef. It was a frozen preformed Patty that you would get at a neighbors BBQ, but it would have to be made out of some sort of soy product. It didn't taste like Beef, it didn't look like beef it was the weirdest gray color I have ever seen. When I only had 2 bites my friend decided I was a wuss and went to give it a try... he spit it out. The only thing on our entire table that was worth eating were the wings. That may have only been because I was trying to get the taste of that burger our of my mouth. Overall of the literally 1,000's of places for you to eat in Vegas this is the worst for food quality. If I wanted to get talked down to while being servered crap food I would go eat at a local McDonalds. At least they are honest and tell us their burgers aren't all real beef.",

I'll write the review of the strip club later). 4 girls, 4 guys, and had an AMAZING TIME. The atmosphere was amazing, granted we showed up completely trashed to begin with, but we had a ton of fun. Got a table right up near the stage and the birthday girl was immediately treated to a lap dance or two from some of the male servers... Our waitress (who's name I dont remember) was FUCKING HILARIOUS. Just yelling at us and throwing shit our way. At one point when I started mouthing off back to her she actually got up in my face and went nose to nose with me!!!! Despite all this she managed to take really good care of us and knew exactly when to be a dick and when to be serious about her job and refill our drinks and what not.    KEEP IN MIND - this place is not for the easily offended!

The plus side you get a silly hat made out of butcher paper but you'll soon find everybody laughing at your expense because the hat usually has \"bitch\" or \"whore\" written on it.  I have to admit, my boyfriend's hat said \"pussy whipped\"....that's pretty hilarious.  Now on to the important part that Dick's seems to completely miss--the food.  I had the crappy cakes....oh I'm sorry, crabby cakes.  These little fried messes were mushy and favorless.   Mushy shitty crab cakes and fries for 16 bucks--that's crappy.  I actually didn't drink so I can't say anything in regards to them.  Oh yes, I happen to witness some poor woman's 21st birthday celebration at Dick's.  Instead of a free piece of cake you get some fat guy doing a chair dance and slamming his beer belly into your face...it's funny to an extent but damn....and the red thong.....",

I understand the concept of purposely obnoxious staff, as I've been to restaurants that take a similar approach, and enjoyed the experience in the past, but like everything American, they were just trying way too hard. No creativity, no wit; it was like watching a terribly acted movie. Our waitress was barely tolerable; nice at times, but far too loud.  On top of this, the restaurant was unnecessarily noisy, the cutlery was dirty, the drinks were piss-poor and WAY too expensive, and the food was also too pricey for what we got, which, for a few of us ended up being indigestion.

The Vegas location tries too hard to be over the top. The way I describe it to my friends is that San Diego developed their style while Vegas hit the ground running and I don't mean that in a good way for Vegas. Anthony, the bartender in San Diego, knows his audience and tailors his \"rudeness\" accordingly. Vegas is like one size fits all. Guess what, it doesn't. And maybe it's the layout. San Diego is one huge rectangle of an old warehouse. You can read the menu on the wall from almost anyplace you sit and if you can't guess what, there's a menu right in front of you. I even had a waitress write a menu in chalk on the ground in front of me. Here I've had to get up in order to read a menu that you can't read because there is a post or a wall in the way. Oh, yeah. I had a party of 20 set up for a birthday party here in Vegas. Even though I had reservation at 6:00 We weren't allowed to sit until \"all\" not most of our party arrived. This wasn't until almost 7. I don't think  that if I'm about to drop several hundred bucks on a joint I shouldn't have to wait an hour becasue three people showed up late.  Vegas do yourself a favor and check out San Diego. That'll show you the difference between a 2 star and 4 star review.",

Where else can you go to get called a pussy for ordering a Guinness, insulted by the wait staff for various things, or watch a random band get up and sing two or three songs and just leave?   Las Vegas is full of upscale yuppie restaurants and what not, but Dick's is an awesome divey place. Where Nobu attracts the yuppies up the street, Dick's attracts the normal folk. Inside and outside is very spacious and comfortable. The wait staff is hilarious and entertaining. Above the bar, there are numerous bras hanging up..as my Dad pointed out.. looks like most of them are from Vicky's. Inside the restaurant, you'll find piles of napkins strewn about on the floor or thrown at a Penthouse Playmate sitting nearby. Best part, beers in a bucket!   If you stumble in here, have a sense of humor. If you don't, you probably belong at Nobu.   We tried the cheese sticks and they were just okay..they have a healthy menu of food offerings, but it's really for the tasty beverage that brings us to Dick's.   They have bands who show up randomly each night, but they don't seem to play for very long.   If you wear a tie, this place isn't for you. They used to cut people's ties when they walked in, but now they may just make fun of you or throw napkins.  Strange, but that's Dick's. Can't wait to go back. If you have no sense of humor like my sister than don't waste yours or anyone elses time, just stay home. Even my 6 year old son was having a blast. They made him out to be the king of the table and the 3 adults to be schmucks. I love this place.",

The ribs were very tough, and even though the wait staff is suppose to be rude, I still expect to have my drinks refilled at least once.   Also, the whole draw is that your waiter is suppose to make funny hats with silly catch phrases on it.  Our waiter didn't make us one, and took one from the table next to us after they left and put it on one of our heads.  Ewww!   I would not recommend this place to anyone, and I was sorry I suggested it for my neicesas they didn't enjoy it.",

Everything we ordered was inedible - Something even a dog wouldn't eat.   The pickled fries were burnt oily and somehow tasted of fish.  The pork ribs was hard as rock (like it was three days old) and the less said of the brisket the better  A terrible waste of $50.  Stay away from this place.",

We actually witness the dance from Taco because the table next to us had a birthday and he did a strip dance for her. HILARIOUS!!! credit to him for wearing a thong!   The food was great too.

The hostess seemed miserable but was helpful in sending us up to Buca di Beppo for their happy hour.    Imagine taking a loaf of Hawaiian rolls and cutting it in half and stuffing it with deli meat and lettuce and odd sauces, but not cutting the sandwiches into individual portions. Everyone in line has to rip apart the loaf of bread. It was a mess by the 6th person and with all the effort the food tasted bland. One of the worst event food selections ive ever had.   The drink was suppose to be a punch with 151 in it, but it ended up tasting like watered down kool aid fit for elementary school students. I asked other people and they had the same questions and we all agreed it was a waste and someone forgot the main ingredient.   There wasnt even dessert offered and we left halfway through because it was a waste of time and effort.   I wouldnt go back or send any of my guests there.",

We ordered a bunch off appetizers, nacho's, fried cheese & fried pickles. It was good bar food. Yep, we love grease.  Next comes the white paper hats with crazy sayings on it that you wear. Kinda worse than a dog's version of the cone of shame. But what the heck? Everyone else is wearing one and honestly, everyone else's seems worse than yours!  The servers yell at each other, ridicule the peeps they wait on. It's pretty entertaining. If you enjoy sarcasm, you'll fit right in. If you're sensitive then you better go somewhere else.  Great drinks! Anything from beer, wine, shots to hurricanes.  Great place to come for a good time. You can be loud & obnoxious and crude! What's not to love about that?

We got two entrees, an appetizer, and four drinks totalling to about 117. The drinks don't have prices on them so I'll spare you here --   Its about 18 per and then 14 per refill, however you get to take the glass home but still not worth almost $60+.  Don't come here to drink, just sit at the tables or slots outside of the restaurant to get free drinks. As soon as we finished up here we sat at the table, bet ~$20 which turned into some wins and 5 free drinks. Much cheaper and easier to do than drinking here.   Other than the expensive drinks and high tab, I wouldn't mind coming back because the food was actually pretty good, although I definitely won't be drinking here next time.   ** Try the \"chicky fried chicky\" **",

I had a Long Island ice tea (alcohol) and it did absolutely nothing for me (didn't get me intoxicated) and the taste of it was bland. Our waitress \"Connie\" was pretty funny, which is why I am giving this review a 2 star instead of a 1 Star.   Would I come back? Probably not. Also.....they had the dueling piano group playing and they weren't that great.   On the other hand, the restaurant appeared to be clean and the staff was \"professional\".",

I chose the Mama Dick's Mac 'n Cheese and got made fun of by the server for being 12 years old.  I will accept responsibility even though I love mac 'n cheese.  However, this one was a pretty average version.  Didn't hate it but it wasn't the best thing I ever ate.  Shared some fried pickles with the group, and these were pretty good. But fried = happiness, pretty much every single time.  Overall, we were very pleased with our visit.  Our server was awesome and kept up a great character.

For Vegas, it wasn't outrageously priced and it scratched an itch for acceptable comfort/junk food.  I liked the gimmick of servers being deliberately rude and found the paper hats/crass humor generally entertaining. The first thing I remember my server saying to me, though, was a question about whether I could read the menu or whether I'd need a magnifying glass to see through my squinty eyes.  I'm Asian and I felt like that was over the line, even for a place that brands itself as \"Dick's\". I didn't read any truly malicious intent from my server and he didn't make any other racist jokes after he saw that it bothered me, but I'd be lying if I said that it hadn't upset me or that it hadn't ruined my meal a little.  I could just be a product of a soft 21st century that has become increasingly hypersensitive. But ultimately, I felt like that was kind of a shitty thing to say and I felt like it was a cheap shot recycled joke that lacked wit and creativity. Objectively speaking, Dick's is not a bad place and has a somewhat worthwhile novelty factor, but I won't be back and I'd give it a lukewarm, \"if you feel like it\" recommendation at best.",

As soon as I found out what they do, I thought to myself, \"why has no one done this before?\"  Dick's Last Resort is a restraunt inside the Excalibur Hotel & Casino that prides itself in it's sense of humor. At Dick's the waitstaff are rude, crude, inappropriate, and HIGHLY unprofessional....... on purpose. And they expect you to do the same. Dick's is a place where social constraints and political correctness are left at the door with your hat and coat.  Our waitress walked up to us, threw our utensils and napkins on the table, tossed us some menus and said \"hurry up and decide what you want!\" I fell in love with this place immediately. The best part was when you have a real question about something (like a menu option) she would switch into real waitress-mode and answer your question.... then mercilessly make fun of you for asking such a dumb question. hahaha.  Our waitress was so great at her job, she actually scared away an older Asian family who sat next to us. I don't think they knew the point of Dick's and didn't appreciate the sarcasm. Our waitress did the same routine with the utensils and menus, but when she returned to take their order, they hadn't decided yet. She asked \"do you all speak English?\" to which a meek \"yes\" must have been uttered, and she followed it up with \"well then liven up a little bit, jeez.\" and she walked away. The eldest lady at the table was already halfway out the restraunt by that point! My wife and I were in tears laughing so hard!  The food was amazing too! My wife had the pulled pork plate and I had the BBQ beef brisket with ribs. Perfection on a plate was what was served to me. I loved it all!  I will most definately be returning to Dick's Last Resort the next time I go to Vegas. 5 stars all the way!",

The food - no better than the much cheaper fare served in the food court of any of the Strip resorts.  The drinks - Badly overpriced.  For a 20oz Coors Light in a POS plastic keepsake pilsner glass, I paid $15.  Save your money and bypass this crude attempt at entertainment.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends on my bachelor party weekend and was not disappointed.  It is probably the most unique restaurant concept I have ever seen - a bold experiment in hospitality, wherein the servers are hired based on their natural capacity to be surly and obnoxious and say absolutely whatever they feel like to their patrons.    Here is a slice of the conversation that occurred while I was ordering:  Me: \"I will have...hmmm....just give me one sec\" Her: \"Hurry the f%$k up.  I need to take other orders.\" Me: \"OK, sheesh, how's this salad?\" Her: \"Not bad, if you're a p&ssy.  I'll put you down for a steak.\" Me: \"Um, thanks but I don't want the steak.  I want the salad.\" Her: (rolls eyes, goes to the next person) \"And what the f@#k do YOU want?\"  I'm not sure how you would like being involved in the above ordering process, but I have to say, I found it refreshing.  Even though I'm a huge fan of great service at restaurants, in life you so rarely encounter someone who is speaking their mind with such utter abandon, that experiencing it is a True novelty.    Do not come here with someone who is easily offended or insecure.  But if you can appreciate being ragged on the whole time you eat and maybe dish it right back to them too, you will have a huge amount of laughs, and memories, on the other side.",

I think I caught our waiter off guard by flicking him the same crap right back. Lol. We would love to find one closer to home so we can go back.if your offended easy it's not for you. The drinks were great. The people were a blast and the funny sayings on the make shift hats had us rolling.

We were looking forward to the Dick's experience by being treated bad and the whole funny, trashy, \"rude\" environment, but our waitress always said thank you, always smiling, not even one funny comment or action, we did get the hats, but that was it.  Food took FOREVER to be served, not the greatest food either, and the drinks where tiny and super expensive.  Everyone else's waiters and waitresses seemed to be yelling at the customers, and having an ok time, but us,  we were just ignored and she just served our food and we never saw her again. Kinda disappointing for $100 we had to pay for 3 meals and 1 drink.",

When you go out, you pay for good food and good service unless you're rolling through McDonald's. This place doesn't have either!   I won't go on about how terrible the service or \"experience\" is because that's pretty apparent, but the food is awful. I am convinced with that they transfer Banquet TV dinners onto plates after they've been microwaved. I didn't get a photo, but check out they mixed veggies. They are straight from the freezer or a can.   I order the over-sauced pulled pork with frozen mac and cheese and processed mashed potatoes. Disgusting!  Sadly, I was with a group of 8 and I was forced to tip.   Anyone giving this place 4-5 stars was probably drunk. Avoid.. there are better places. It's Vegas after all.",

If you ask for a straw, they will throw it at you. If your stupid enough to ask for it, they will write witty sexual innuendo's on a piece of paper, fold it into a phallic shape, and place it on your head.  It's called Dicks. You knew the risks.  It's not totally like it's counterpart I remember so fondly in San Diego, but it's close enough. I stopped here with some friends while killing time on our way to the Luxor. The consensus was that we were hung over, and the best way to cure a hang over, keep drinking.   The beers were cheap. Not a huge selection of drafts, but good enough. Best part, 3 dollar Patron shots during the afternoon. This took me to a much better place. If it's 1 pm in the afternoon, and you need to continue your liquid diet, belly up to the bar, say something stupid, and let the magic happen.",

You don't just come here for the food, you come here for the entertainment, and the entertainment is your server and hosts being complete and total dicks to you. Why is this entertainment? Because we all enjoy a little bashing on, I mean I got a kick out of the host being a dick to my parents and my parents arguing back because they hadn't caught on to the restaurant theme. hahah.  Their food was decent, nothing too amazing. we got the appetizer sample platter and I enjoyed everything on there, and we also got the steak with mashed potatoes and the mashed potatoes were yummmy. The wait for the food was forever, but the entertainment kept us occupied. Thanks to Dick's, I'll never watch Grease \"Summer Nights\" without noticing the sexual references..seriously, watch it and tell me how many you catch, I didn't notice any until I came here.

To be honest, our waitress did not really give us as much trouble as she gave the other tables. We were pretty much left alone. She came to our table 3 times in total. Didn't even get those embarrassing hats that everyone else seemed to be wearing. I overheard the treatment everyone else got and it was hilarious. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the prices for food. They are ridiculous. The cheapest thing there was the mac and cheese which is what I ended up having. I wouldn't come here to eat again but I would come back to have a drink. It's a funny place if you have the sense of humor for it. If you are easily offended, don't come here.",

The menu is limited and mostly sandwiches, burgers, and finger foods, but we knew that before hand and wanted to try it for the experience.  You have to be silly and light hearted to enjoy this place, cannot get offended easy and have to go along with the jokes to enjoy it.  The waiters are JERKS and talk a lot of crap to you but its hilarious when they punk you and everyone else just laughs, including other tables.  Our waiter made these tall paper hats for us that all had funny embarrassing quotes.  We couldn't help but laugh at ourselves.  It was a great time.",

I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which had a nice kick to it! The pricing is very good too, especially for Vegas.   All the waiters/waitresses are \"dicks\" to you. Throw napkins, curse, give you paper hats with some gross comments written on them but it is absolutely hilarious. If you are a sensitive person and are looking for a nice place to eat, this is not your place. If you have a sense of humor, i highly reccommend this place.  Only complaint was that we had reservations but still had to wait another hour. But we chalked it up to being in Vegas",

    "text": "Dick's is a fun place to eat. My wife was a bit nervous cause she doesn't handle rudeness very well, but Dick's is more fun than anything. The waiters are trained to be obnoxious and do things like throw napkins at you or eat fries off your plate. They even make paper hats for you with insults on them, e.g., \"I pee in the shower\" and \"I've had more Mexicans in me than a Home Depot parking lot.\" If you don't go in with a sense of humor, you probably won't enjoy it. They don't take it so far over the top as to make you cry. It is a business after all and they want to keep you coming back in the end. Even my wife had a good time. The food was surprisingly better than I expected as well. I got the fried catfish and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was plenty of fish and fries to fill me up. My wife got a burger that was big and juicy and enjoyed her meal as well. The menu has items such as \"pork bonerz\" and the \"Dolly Parton,\" that were kind of funny to see. Our meals were $15 - $20 so the price was slightly higher than what you might expect to pay for the food, but it is in a hotel/casino on the Vegas strip. All-in-all it was a fun place to stop by and I would recommend it for a good laugh and a lunch, but if you get offended easily you probably want to leave this place alone. The watiers aren't afraid to whip out the sailor talk!",

Then your waiter/ess may feel the need to manufacture  a huge/tall paper hat made for you out of butcher paper. They put it on you with out you asking or realizing. It's not till all the laughs and stares that you get the idea that something lewd maybe written about you. Yes, I did get one. The waitress wrote something about meeting me at the 'happy ending' salon.. Nice eh.. any ways,.. if you have a sense of humor, don't mind vulgarity then it can be a entertaining place to dine. Also, there is the bar man who does a water show to music. The food and drinks where your typical $$$$. My friend paid $4 for a glass of Sprite. The place doesn't really float my boat for my personality but with a group of friends it was o.k..  One more thing, there's a stage for a live band. The time we where there, it was vacant.",

    "text": "I had a blast here at Dicks! I must say it was definitely a different experience than your typical restaurant experience and I loved it. First off I have to say if you have no sense of humor then don't eat here because at this restaurant the waiters are rude and crude and they make fun of you. They also let you make fun of them which is alot of fun. Then at the end of the meal you get these big paper hats that say funny things on them. Our waitress was so funny. When we first got there she threw our plasticware on the table and walked away. Then she came back and asked us if we decided yet and was telling us to hurry the hell up. She was making funny jokes and really had us laughing the entire time. She actually scared this Asian family out of there. I don't think they knew what the place was about and she was asking them if they spoke English and she told them to lighten up. They got up and walked out. I never laughed so hard in my life. When we had a legitimate question she went into waitress mode and answered it for us. This is the only restaurant where I told a waitress to bring me a damn to go box and it was ok. My husband told her to bring us the fucking check. It was a hoot. As far as the food goes I thought it was really good actually. I got the pulled pork plate and I loved it. My husband got the BBQ beef brisket and the ribs and he loved his also. The prices were good for Vegas. We all know anything in a Vegas casino is going to cost way more than it would anywhere else so I have different price standards for Vegas. This is by far the only redeeming quality the Excalibur has to offer and I will only return there to eat here.",

    "text": "The concept of Dicks is that you pay the same as you would any place else for inferior service and treatment, and you're supposed to do it with a smile because that's their shtick.  It's brilliant on their part.  Customers think its a cute theme, when it's really just being lazy.  For example, instead of printed menus, they just have a handwritten list of food taped to the wall.  We wandered in here in the afternoon right after checking into the Excalibur.  We were looking for a chill place to grab a snack and get our bearings.  We were not looking for Dick's.  The waiters grunt at you, point in answer to questions, wander off, and go out of their way not to be rude.  We ordered nachos, which were fine, although they skimped on the toppings so half the chips went uneaten.  What I really didn't like about Dick's was the 'entertainment.'  After making stupid paper hats for some of the customers, the waiters took multiple packs of napkins and tossed them all over the restaurant, the food and into the drinks.  I know the waiter thought my pissed off look was due to him balling up a napkin and hitting me in the eye with it, but he was wrong.  I got that it was all a part of the 'ambiance' of Dicks.    What pissed me off was to see the wanton waste of trees that must happen countless times a day in this place for the sake of pretending to be jerks.  I even recycle my toilet paper rolls at home.  Just thinking about all my little daily efforts to do what's right by the environment and how in the course of a month Dick's crass wastefulness probably offsets the efforts I make all year really pissed me off.  I didn't care about getting winged in the eye with a ball of paper.  I was already done with Dick's and ready to go.",

Luckily had made a reservation because the wait was absurd.  We waited about 15 minutes to be seated despite having a reservation.  I tried the fried pickles, fried cheese, and the fried shrimp.  All of these items were not good.  Also, water was not free.  Honestly, I was surprised at how little we were teased and heckled by our server.  Additionally, we did not receive our hats until we were paying the check.  I would have appreciated more attention, because the infamous servers are such a huge part of the dining experience here.

I don't mind the shtick at all and found it pretty entertaining, but you can tell that the place is run by someone as horrible as the servers because of the attitude (not the shtick, the attitude after they left the tables) on the floor. Then I met the \"manager\" and she was worse than I imagined. I would rather have had my food dumped on my head than listen to the \"manager\" give me a fake greeting and speak to me like she only cared about the amount of money I was going to give them ... then I heard her talking about other guests and employees and I was baffled she would do that on the floor, let alone at all. I wish I didn't receive any greeting or \"table touch\" (which I'm sure was required) from her at all because it ruined our experience. Just don't table touch if you're going to be fake about it or if you're in a bad mood. I don't think managers and staff realize what the guests can see on the floor. We're not dummies, we're real people who may mistakenly have chosen your restaurant to spend our money at if you're going to act like that. There's so much business in Vegas but it's no wonder they suffer and quite honestly, I feel bad for her. Won't go back.",

Only a mature audience with a great sense of humor should attend this location. I would not recommend for anyone to bring their kids here, even tho kids are allowed to come inside.  Everyone was degraded and it was hilarious! Food is alright, but they make the \"Dick's\" experience very fun and great! While or after you eat, you are given these hand made paper hats that have a message that \"degrades you\" with a sense of humor. I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone else, but of course not to the ones who are weak!  I got their \"Big ass Breakfast Burrito\" which is called what I just wrote. Along with that, we were recommended to try the \"Dos-rita\" which is basically those popular Corona Margarita drinks that have a beer in the margarita but these carry a Dos X instead. This \"Dos-Rita\" drink is definitely good and well worth every penny!  Man the hell up and come on over to Dick's!",

    "text": "My sister and Boyfriend really wanted to try this place. They heard how funny and sarcastic it was suppose to be and wanted to experience it. Being the sarcastic and funny bunch we are we all agreed and went here around 10:30 Saturday night. At first our waitress was very sarcastic and it was pretty funny. A bit awkward cause we didn't know how to react but still funny.  With the waitress, the only thing that I was offended by from all her sarcasm was when she created my hat. She put \"I've had more Mexicans inside of me than a Home Depot parking lot\" Being that I am Hispanic and a female, I felt that was very rude and I was offended. I took that hat off right away. I didn't that was funny at all. I have a really good sense of humor, but that hat made me feel uncomfortable.   Food: We got our food which I though was overly priced. I got Fish and Chips which was about 18.00 and my boyfriend got Chicken Tenders for about the same price. We expected something great since the prices were so high. Boy were we wrong. I got my plate and right away started eating the fries and realized how old they were. They were so old they were practically stale. The worst part was how it was warm as if they had just recooked it again cause even the color of the fries looked old - like they didn't change the oil in a while. (i worked in the food industry) So when the waiter came I asked for new fries. The Fish was just as bad. Very very greasy it had no flavor just tasted like grease. Chicken tenders was about the same stale and hard. We right away asked for the check there was no way we were gonna eat this.   When we asked for our check she looked at out plates and asked why we didn't eat and we let her know the reasons. She told us, \"I bet you are used to Applebees that's why\" and we told her ... \"Well, yeah we would have actually preferred Applebees and enjoyed it better for less of the cost\".  We were very pleased when she removed our plate off the bill. I was actually very surprised.   The overall experience was just that an experience and I am glad we tried it. But for the high prices  and the poor quality of food. We will not be going back.",

Christina, Kevin and Taco are all some of the most witty, sharp and badass people I've ever met. More importantly, Their customer service was on point. After all, it's called \"Dick's\", we knew what we were in for. They lived up to the name but they had me laughing from start to finish. It was almost hard to eat my food. They followed it all up with shots on the house and I left a happy camper.   On top of the excellent (and entertaining) service, the food hit the spot after spending your typical Vegas Saturday morning hung over making friends with toilets. By the way, Dick's toilets, hands down, the cleanest I came across in Vegas.  Thank you for a hilarious time!",

I did see though, a couple family tables with children off to the side away from the noise (but why?)  Overall it's a fun place.  We sat at the bar which is at the entrance and you can see at all the tables around, people are having a good time with their silly paper hats with insult messages written on them.  Our bartender quickly helped us get drinks and a food menu while cracking jokes the entire time.  Not a whole lot of beer on tap, but plenty of food to choose from.  I had no idea what to eat so I closed my eyes, pointed to the menu, and went with \"Chicky Fry'd Chicky\" ($19.99).  It was a huge, filling fried chicken smothered in mashed taters which I ended up having to share.",

Parking is no longer free at some of the Vegas hotels which is one of the attractions previously for me, so we parked nearby and walked to avoid paying for parking ... bc cheap non big city girl.  We went here for a birthday but everyone was a little nervous after reading reviews and preparing for the put downs. Some family members stayed home and we left the little kids too.  They cuss at you, talk back, aren't helpful and the best part is the hats. We had decided just to order appetizers before going since the food wasn't said to be impressive in other reviews. That being said we were actually impressed by the appetizers, which were the nachos and the wings. My daughter ordered the steak salad with a lemonade and also liked it. The group who ordered entrees weren't as impressed.   It was definitely an experience and we were all glad we did it. We had a great time! The only thing that was annoying is the server didn't/wouldn't split our bill until we actually forced the issue. I was also surprised they don't do anything for people when they come for their birthday, I imagined some sort of horrible song and gross dessert... We still left happy and full.",

It was late afternoon before the crowds and the place wasn't overly busy with lots of open tables.  The large group of 8 waited for about 4 minutes and then seated ourselves as there were plenty of open tables.  After we sat down and were talking for a couple of minutes, one of the staff came to us and told us to get up as we weren't to seat ourselves. We were walked back to an area near the bar.  As we began to sit down, there were 3 broken chairs (rungs and legs were loose with some rungs missing) and the staff initially told us \"too bad.\" When I mentioned I didn't think management would want folks sitting in unsafe chairs, the 2 members of their staff relented and found us replacements.    We all expected the sass and attitudes, but the F bombs and insulting name calling to a few of the group was a tad over the top and excessive compared to my other trips to this chain.   I had the Bacon Cheddar Burger and a beer.  The beer came out quickly, but it was room temperature.  A near by table complained of the same thing and was told \"too bad.\"  The burger came out quickly,  The near paper thin 2 slices of bacon were almost too insignificant to call it a bacon burger.  The patty was dry. The bun was dry and crumbled apart very quickly.  The taste was okay. The fries were cold.   The rest of the party mentioned cold food and poor quality as well.  A couple were disappointed as the bar didn't seem to be well stocked.  Service was poor and the price was way too much for the poor service and poor food.  There are many places to go to in Vegas to get better service and food.",

    "text": "We didn't know upon arrival but the theme here is the staff try's to offend the customers. Which is fun!  Atmosphere is very loud and there is plenty to keep your eyes busy. People are wearing very tall white paper hats with their own personal messages on them. There is a balloon man that is quite talented making, well just about anything! Also funny customer contests and a DJ that keeps moving the music along  I'm giving 2 stars cause the food is barely ok, drinks are really overpriced and our waiter was just crabby. Even for Vegas. Pickled chips were a joke they were a version of what was supposed to be pickled chips. Nachos had topping on top but a mound of chips underneath that could have used some more ingredients. Food going by our table was also just so-so looking. Nothing amazing.   I ordered 2 Red Bull's and single vodkas which was $30!!!  New York New York (across the street) has the exact same drink at their bars for $8 each. Bartender was also tired and crabby. Even for the themed restaurant.   Probably won't be back but it was fun to try it!",

    "text": "So read reviews before going in case you're not already aware of the special treatment you're going to receive at Dicks!  We were aware and had a super fun time. We were humiliated and sang loud and laughed a lot. But there was a poor couple who were dressed really nicely for a lovely dinner...they ate fast and left fast. Not having it!  Here's the thing, if you go for the fun outrageous antics, odds are you'll have a super experience. If you go for the food/drinks, you might be disappointed. Even though this is Vegas and inside The Excalibur on The Strip, the food is way overpriced it what you receive. I mean, we expect to pay in Vegas but give us our money's worth. If you order a drink, you pay double for a \"collectible\" glass whether you want it or not. And the drinks are very weak. So at $16.99 for an American Mule and another $16.99 for some big frozen drink, I expect to taste and feel my liquor.... Not so much... And the food was mediocre at best. We had everything from the huge Nachos, to Ribs & Wings ($24), to Dave's Seafood Platta ($24). Again--decent but not amazing.  However, having said that, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!  Somehow our waiter knew exactly what to put on each of our ridiculous hats!  We were dying!  Our large party of 11 luckily got there around 5:45, just before the rush came in!  They don't take reservations. And we sat near the dueling piano bar, but were too early for that.  However about halfway through our meal, when the dining room was pretty full, the DJ came on and led us through several songs where we all could sing along. Since we had teens and adults the songs caught all of us in our funny bone. My husband even got up and danced with my 16-yr old to a very sentimental family favorite, which is totally out of character for both of them. All that to show that we really had a great time! So to wrap up: Food/Drinks  Service (Dick's style)  Experience",

They definitely live up to the hype of very unfriendly staff.  When you first get there you are seated and then told to fix your own table. The staff continues to berate you and your family while keeping it fun. While waiting to order they come out with this great hats that have some sort of rude comment about each person. I got \"Even my crabs have herpes.\" Stuff like that is just hilarious.  You definitely should not come here if you have a thin skin and easily get offended. Then this place isn't for you. You come here on purpose for the rude and offensive staff.  I would love to give this place 5 stars but I'm knocking one star off for the food quality. This pace is great but I can't say the same for the food. It was just okay. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that had absolutely no flavor and was soggy before it hit the table. We also had some ribs that were overcooked and extremely dry.",

I personally loved this place because it was a great experience and I've been waiting to go here for a while. Our waiter wasn't as rude as I thought, but he looked intimidating. He was actually a very nice guy when it came to our food and me asking questions. I guess some people just can't keep themselves in character, but that's okay. After all the rudeness, it's nice to see a nice side.   Our waiter made my boyfriend up a hat with something written on it that I've forgotten and for me? He blew up a balloon and shaped it into a dick, LOL!!   The food here isn't bad. It was decent and I'd definitely come back. The price for my group of four cost $100 bucks. Roughly about $25 per person, but I can't argue, It's Vegas.   Minus one star because he mentioned that my tip wasn't even 10%. For your information, tip isn't part of the meal. It's me being generous enough to even leave extra money for YOU. Even though I'm sure the waiter gets paid a decent amount, there was only four of us. Tip is added with a group of six or more people. Maybe he was being rude since he gets paid to do so, or he was being serious. Whatever it was, it made me a little irritated.",

    "text": "I went here with my niece.  We'd never heard of the place before.  We were waiting to begin our disappointing experience with Thunder from Down Under and thought we'd get a bite to eat.  As we walked in, we noticed the sign that said they would be rude to us.  We also got a warning from the hostess as she walked us to our table.  Our waitress was great.  We were both a little stunned when she threw a piece of butcher paper on the table and told us to clear everything off so that we could put it down as a table cloth.  We weren't fast enough and were too busy laughing so she came over and insulted us several times before we got the table covering on.    She then tried to take our drink orders.  My niece, who is only 19, tried to order a virgini daiquiri but the waitress told her they don't make virgin drinks.  She gave me a hard time for drinking soda instead of alcohol, too.  When she came back with our drinks, she had a virgin daiquiri for my niece.  She slapped it down on the table with a \"here you little four year old.  Here is your baby drink\".  Ha ha!  She was great!  There was a DJ who played music.  Every once in a while he would make us clap, sing, etc.  He was placed up high and could see the whole bar.  When he spotted someone who wasn't participating he would call them out.  He yelled at one girl saying \"Hey girl with too much makeup on.  How do you put that much makeup on to go out and then sit there not clapping?\"  Too funny.  The best part was when he made fun of the large group of people who had brought their young children out to the place.  He had us boo them for bringing their kids.  The kids, meanwhile, all had at least 6 helium balloons tied into their hair making it stand on end.  The boys had hats that said \"I have an itchy bum and a stinky finger\" or \"I thought it was a fart\".  My niece got a hat that said \"My mom still thinks I'm a virgin\".    I'll agree the food wasn't the best.  It's typical fried food.  We had the appetizer sampler that had chicken fingers, wings, mozz sticks, and fried pickles.  It was a lot of food and we didn't finish it.  It was about $21 for the sampler.",

This only gives them an excuse to ignore you, act like complete idiots, and serve absolutely sub standard food. Who's going to complain when you know full well they will make fun of you or simply not care. Cold, obviously re-heated food at extraordinary high prices for no more than under average bar food. They get you to come in once for \"the experience\" My bet is 95% of customers are 1st timers...and won't be back! It's a shame, they have an interesting concept...but went WAY too over the top. In a word, it SUCKED!",

They got our drinks & menus out right away. They had out apps done quick & then our food came. It was all awesome. We ordered crabby balls (app) I ordered the It Works burger & my husband ordered the fish & chips. His fish was gross but the drinks, crabby balls & my burger were all so good that we didn't even care about the fish. My burger was so ginormous that I split it with him & we both left so stuffed. I will say, If you're offended easily this is not the place for you. The servers are rude, but again that's what their getting paid to do!! I wish I could talk to customers like that LOL!",

    "text": "The food was \"meh\" and they purposively do not tell you the price of the drinks you are ordering and then SURPRISE! you get your bill and realize that they were anywhere from 25-40 bucks a piece.  Granted, we're responsible for ourselves but please, God, if you're going there and are on a budget- be sure to ask the prices of the drinks before you order as they will not tell you on purpose.  There's also no descriptions of the food on the menu either.   I'm from Toronto and made a reservation there for last Saturday for all of us to have dinner together. Our server was alright and the food came relatively quickly- but I felt very neglected by him as not even everyone in my party received hats and I don't think he even spoke to half of us.  Maybe my expectations were too high or they were just overly busy- but this was the one time that my entire group from Toronto was going to be together and I think maybe I just expected much more.  He maybe \"insulted\" two people and gave half of us hats over the course of an hour and a half and that was the end of it.  Kinda brutal.  Go for the experience, not for the food- but set your expectations low for that, too.  It might be better if the place is less busy and your party is much smaller. They also don't do anything for birthdays either unless you're the lucky chosen one to receive a lap dance from an overweight naked guy.  I wasn't so lucky. Damn.",

I have my buddies who will do that for free, why go to a place where you just want to get your grub on and PAY for abuse?  It's funny, some of our servers jokes bordered on sexual harassment as one of the girls in our party didn't seem to like what he was saying. Again, some people may like it and think it's A-OK, but I wasn't feeling it.  The food was basic bar food, nothing really to write home about and it was a bit on the pricey side for what it was.  The only good thing about the place, if you order a \"Large\" margarita, expect it to be about 40 or so more ounces. My friend and I tried to finish this from here to state line and I ended up knocking out (because of traffic) and when I did wake up at State line, I was already hung over, lmao.   So, I would probably come here just for that drink and eat elsewhere. I would rather have sh*t talked back and forth between my friends and I, instead of some server who basically gets to do what he/she wants.",

    "text": "One Liner: I got charged $5 extra when I don't think I should have been. Story: I went to Dick's for the first time with my girlfriend. She told me all about it and I was excited for a fun meal. The waitress was rude and insulting, just as I was hoping for.  I played along and pretended to be a dorky academic type just for fun.  I got a funny hat as did my girlfriend.  Everything great so far.  The food was mediocre at best, about on par with Denny's. (I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got a Philly cheesesteak.)  We decided to get a drink from the bar to share in souvenir cup: $27.  We had a coupon for free fried pickles that we used - they were quite salty, but still pretty good. Then I decided to give back some of the insults I was getting, so I wrote on the table with ketchup, \"IF MY WAITRESS SUCKED HARDER I'D ORGASM.\" As soon as she saw it she said that she could legally charge me for that, so I simply held out my hand for the bill. Sure enough, she added on $4.99 for \"add chicken\" that I never ordered. Thankfully she took off the charge for the fried pickles, but only after I reminded her to. After she saw the table message, her attitude changed. No insults, no talk back, she became cold and distant and dealt with us very little, only as long as was needed to handle our immediate requests. \"Maybe she was busy with other customers,\" you might say. Yes, she was busy interacting a lot with other customers in the way she is supposed to, but not with us. Now, I understand that ketchup on the table is mess to clean up, but I wrote it on the DISPOSABLE PAPER table cover - the mess can be simply picked up and thrown away. Even if she claimed that the ketchup would seep through the paper, so would any other grease, oil, accidentally spilled drink, and any other wet thing that got on the table cover during the normal course of a meal, so there is effectively no difference - she'd have to clean it anyway.  If she claimed that I used too much ketchup, what would she say to anyone who simply likes ketchup or some other condiment? Would she actually charge extra money to patrons for using too much mustard, or salt, or pepper? What if I had accidentally dropped and spilled it? Also, a 32 oz. bottle of ketchup from Walmart costs $2.82, and I believe that restaurants buy such things for less because they buy in bulk. Perhaps she was insulted by my comment. Understandable. But, how could she work in a place where the shtick is to insult patrons yet be unable to tolerate insults tossed back at her? So, like I started with, $5 I didn't need to pay. That was BS. So I took it out of her tip. Your welcome, waitress, for me giving you anything other than a rude gesture for a tip.",

    "text": "For every person who gave Dicks a 1-star, or even a 2-star review, CRAWL OUT OF THE BOX YOU'RE LIVING IN AND GET A SENSE OF HUMOR!!!  Ok, here's the deal. The only reason why Dick's has received so many low ratings is for one of the following:      Horrible food - understandable, but come on, it's in the MEXcalibur!     Horrible Service - um, clearly you're illiterate and didn't read the sign out front     Overpriced - it's VEGAS!! Go to Circus Circus if you want $2 beers all day  Now, for the GREATNESS that is Dicks. As our waitress Nancy simply put it, it's \"service with sarcasm\", and that's what she gets paid to do. Examples - she just threw the napkins, beer cups and forks onto the table, yelled at us for not being ready to order and had little nicknames for some of us.  Do some of the remarks made by the waitstaff border on cruel and degrading, ABSOLUTELY, but that's what makes this place so great. In addition, they make (almost) everyone paper hats with witty remarks on them. Here are some of the best that I remember:   \"If found, please return to the nearest Home Depot parking lot\" (Mexican Guy) \"Just call me 'Summer's Eve', cuz I'm a douche\" \"I've given more rides than Seabiscuit\" (blonde sorority girl) \"Handjobs - $1\" \"I fart KY jelly\" (Macho frat guy)  All I can say is that you need to come here for the EXPERIENCE, not the SERVICE/FOOD. In fact, by the end of our meal, we were helping our waitress come up with sayings for other people and she even put on the \"Handjobs - $1\" hat and took pictures with us holding up $1 bills.   NANCY...YOU WERE AWESOME!!!",

And since I was staying at the Excalibur this seemed the the best choice.I had never experienced this place, but didn't take me long to realize that their \"thing\" is basically being rude, and the customer is there to entertain them. And it is funny as ever.The food was good, not the best, but it was packed and late so I loved it. They do a fun thing as well, where they make a hat for you with something (usually rude) written on it. Everyone in the place was laughing and having a great time. It really was fun.A lot of reviews complain about the \"rude service\". But once you understand it's all for fun and just relax, you will have a great time. If you're not into that kind of thing, don't come here and then complain about it.",

    "text": "I've come here about three years ago when this Dick's was brand new.  I knew what this place offered.  It was a football Sunday and the sports book was super crowded so we stopped in here to get some food and drinks while watching ten football games at once.  Our server was pretty cool.  He brought paper for the tablecloth and threw napkins in our direction.  Yep they do have attitude here and any customer who can throw had better be ready to get it back.  They also do those paper hats with funny sayings on there.  They no longer have menus but a menu posted on the wall.  Those who are too far have to walk over to the wall to read it...any other place this sort of thing wouldn't do...but here at Dick's...hilarious!  One good redeeming thing about the food is their onion rings.  They were perfectly cooked with the right amount of crispiness.  Whoever did that batch, I bow to your skill.  The brisket sandwich I got was OK and the chicken tenders and fries that my friend got was not so hot.  Did I mention that most of this food was $12 and up?  $14 for chicken strips and fries?  Ridiculous!  AND, the beer selection has magically shrank since I last came here.  They used to have over 15 types of beer on tap here now all they got are the sad macrobrews that the gamblers get served outside plus Blue Moon(ran out that day) and Guinness.  I got a Guinness from them and it set me back $14!  Beer pricing also not shown when I ordered.  I don't think I can describe how disappointed I am with all this Dick's has gone downhill since I was last here.  Please bring back the draft beer selection like Newcastle, Sam Adams, or Anchor Steam.  People come into your restaurant to have drinks that they can't get while gambling so if you have overpriced food plus minimal beer selection, then that's a recipe for disaster.",

They had a pretty good cover band playing and that was probably the highlight of my experience here (besides the explicit message written on our bill haha).

We had to wait for 3 people in our party because they won't seat you unless everyone is there. So we visited the bar and had some drinks!  We were sat down and right away they started I tried to help a server with a high chair and she said \"sit the F down, is this your house??\"   Then our server puts a hat on my nephew that said \"mommy shakes me\" lol next my daughter got one that said \"future vegas stripper\". We ordered our food most got wings I had a burger and my hubby had the steak. It was all pretty good! While we were waiting for our food it was a ladies bday so of course Dicks gives her a present!! A lap dance from a rather large gentlemen. This guy was good lol I couldn't stop laughing. He was even wearing a nice red thing under his jeans which was shown off when he rubbed his ass all over her lap!! I then got a hat that said \" my (picture of a cat) smells like (picture of a fish).\" It's a lil expensive but it's like dinner and a show!!  I do recommend NOT bringin kids though....it's really really loud my daughter didn't care for it. But the music is good and the drinks are strong!",

Every trip to Dick's is different. Each server will be different from the last.   We went around 4 in the afternoon with my teenage daughter and 8 yr old.  My kids got a kick out of the place, and the server was age appropriate with his Dick-like ways. He made my little girl a hat that says \"I pee in the pool\" and she thought it was hilarious.   But holy crap it's expensive. $4.00 for a soda? Pay the .75 for water. Yes, you have to pay for water but the cups are great to refill when you're walking the strip.  I think they had 2 for 1 drinks at the bar but I didn't have any.  The food was ok. Typical bar food that is crazy overpriced. Yikes. I think we paid around $65 for 5 of us, and only one person ate an entree, we shared an app and got one dessert.  Half our bill was probably for soda. Ugh.

So glad I did, they are the rudest waiters & waitresses I have ever encountered and I loved it because that is the concept of the restaurant.  The definitely stuck to the script.  Not to mention we had 2 for 1 drink coupons that worked out well so we drunk up!  The food was very yummy I ordered the Fried Catfish, it was very fresh, hot and tasty. Oh and the music that they were playing is music I listen to, HIP HOP. The only reason why I gave 4 starts is because it wasn't enough fish but other than that, this place is great.",

I ordered a small beer but got charged for and was given a large instead. I guess I wasn't bothered, but no way in hell I could finish it.   My waiter was cool. I knew I was in love with the idea of this place when he walked up and just threw the forks and knives onto the table and walked away.  That was pretty much it. I was here with my best friend and my parents, who are totally cool, but for some reason my mom was NOT having a good time (even though she very well knew what she was getting into) and was in a piss poor mood the entire time and made it awkward. I think the waiter picked up on it, so he wasn't ever around, so I didn't really get the experience.  The only thing was that he walked up right as I had just started looking at the menu and asked if everyone was ready. I kind of looked up and he said, \"Or I can come back, you know. I have other shit to do.\" which, of course, tickled my funny bone.  Other than that, like I said, literally no interaction. I did get a hat, but no talkin'-to or anything. If I had come here with just my friend, or even my dad, I'm sure we would have had a hell of a good time.   My advice is if anyone in your party is not sure if they want to come here, DON'T BRING THEM or go somewhere else! Only go if you really, REALLY know you want to.",

Hopefully you can tell by my star rating and utter facetiousness that in reality, this place is fantastic.  As they warn you as you enter, you best know what you are getting into before you enter.    This themed restaurant is extremely fun to visit and dine at as they treat you miserably, with the upside that you get to do the same in return.  The service itself was actually quick and accurate, but you always get lip no matter what you order, compliment, or complain about.    The food is completely appetizing, especially good as an all-nighter/hangover recover food.  Good beef, chicken, and pork based sandwiches and burgers to choose from.  They have a full bar, of course, and serve all Pepsi products from the fountain.  The Las Vegas Dick's do a great job achieving the desired effect and theme of the restaurant chain, better than the San Diego franchise, sorry to say, and their unique approach to customer service should be applauded.",

Everything is way over priced! I had a burger and fries while my husband had the fish and chips. We also had two drinks. Our total bill was 90 dollars. Now I'm guessing you are mostly paying for the entertainment... They put the little funny hats on and you laugh a little and so on, but our waitress lacked a sense of humor and was hardly rude as she was suppose to be. Very plain Jane. Anyways the only True positive I have to say about this place is my dos Rita drink! Was actually really good. It was a large glass of margarita with a dos Equis inside. The atmosphere is fun, it's fun to read everyone's hat... My hat said \"blah blah blah stick it in my ass\" which is completely accurate lol! Over all sort of a fun place with the right waiter, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",

She hijacked my friends phone and took a pic of her own boobs, she called us cheap asses, she threw our plastic utensils at us, and she came up with clever sayings or pictures for all of our hats.   This place is not for kids but I would return with my friends again because we had some great laughs.

I got the Spicy Salmon and it was not good. The salmon was REALLY dry which made it not enjoyable. It was also not spicy, so it should probably just be called \"salmon\".

The service and the experience were what was expected: dancing, sing alongs, playing games, loud music, crude hats, rude service, watered down drinks, greasy/unhealthy food, and a chance to get rowdy and wild.  I think this is a great place for tourists--one time in your life is enough.  I saw a few people with their infant children which I thought was outrageous.

Long story short: overpriced, you'll wait forever for your food, you don't get any water refills, and to top it off a creepy guy server will try to touch your girlfriend when you walk to the bathroom.   Alright first off, I knew what to expect going to Dick's. I had been here for lunch once before. I remembered the food was okay, and nothing crazy happened.  But my experience tonight was an interesting one. Despite the 1 star rating, our server was funny and probably the best thing about the whole experience.  She made us funny paper hats and her sarcasm was fun.   To start, we ordered two things from the menu, the Spinach/Kale Artichoke Dip, and the Bucket O' Low Country Boil. It took 45 minutes for any food to come out.  We arrived at 11pm with lots of open tables. Only a few other groups were in the restaurant at the time. If they were very busy, I could understand why the seafood could take so long, but there should be no reason chips and dip take almost an hour to prepare.  The bucket of seafood was okay, served with one side of melted butter. I wanted some other sauces for dipping, unfortunately nobody had asked us, and no one was around to ask after the food had been dropped off.   Upon that, I had an empty water cup sitting for a very long time, with no servers coming to check on us. I asked for a refill before getting our food. Which I received a sarcastic \"Nope were out of water.\" We laughed and I naturally thought she was joking.  But I wasn't sure because I never ended up seeing that refill until after we were completely finished with our meal.   We take off our paper hats our server had made us, and start to clean up. I leave to the restroom to wash my hands. While I am away, another employee comes up behind my girlfriend. Puts a hat that he made himself on her while touching and massaging her head and hair from behind. She turns around to see who it is and he quickly walks away.  He comes back shortly after, trying to do it again until she catches him and tells him to stop. And he responds with, \"Oh is that weird?\"  I had to ask around to get his name, because he wasn't around when I got out of the restroom. Apparently his name is Doug, caucasian about 5'10, Long curly brown hair.   Don't know how long he has been working there, but another employee says he's known for being inappropriate towards guests. He shouldn't be touching and groping girls at all.  Surely it can't be their policy to be unprofessional like this so my advice to the management is to get rid of Doug and any other creeps like him that give this restaurant this terrible reputation.  People come to have a good time there, and unfortunately we were left with a very uncomfortable one.",

Our waitress took our orders and immediately ran off before we could decide on an appetizer. When she came back, I told her we wanted to order an appetizer and she screamed at me saying I should've ordered \"like a big girl\" before she left the table. She didn't even give us a chance to do this because she left so quickly! Yes, I understand being rude is their concept but there should be a certain point in which they still at least try to accommodate for their guests.   The food is nothing to rave about either. Their menu doesn't have a lot of options besides a bunch of overpriced fried food. I ordered the half rack of ribs that came with fries and the fries were stale. The ribs were a bit dry and could've used more barbecue sauce.  We also told our waitress that one of our friends in our party was celebrating his birthday and she yelled \"Nobody cares!!!!\" We thought they'd do something humorous since it was his birthday but it went completely ignored. They didn't do anything at all.   I'll never go back....",

Its located inside the Excalibur, and from the get got he waiter was raggin on me. It was pretty entertaining the things they were telling people. The location has plenty of seating and a full bar.  I ordered the mac and cheese burger and quickly regretted it. It was just decent... I can tell this place is just all about having fun first and second comes the food. The burger tasted like it was a frozen patty, and the toppings just didn't taste very fresh. Id go back for a beer, but wouldn't go back for food.",

She was super nice to us. Lucky for us we started interacting with the other male servers and it got to be more fun and entertaining. Our server seem like she didn't care about us. If we wanted to go to a normal dining we would have gone somewhere else. I highly suggest you guys request a male server. They are more fun and entertaining. Food is over price for the quality and quantity. Probably wouldn't recommend to go here for the food either.",

If you have a good sense of humor and like to have a little fun and let loose join in on the fun. They make you hats based off of the vibe they revive from you. Lol my hat said \"I've blown more black men than Hurricane Katrina\"   I would give it a 5 star for entertainment but I rated this place a 3 stars based off the food and prices.  The food is actually ok. I revived a free appetizer with the check in on Yelp! I ordered the alligator(just in case it was nasty I didn't pay for it). This was my first time trying gator and to my sip rise is wasn't bad. I know everyone says things taste like chicken but this really did taste like spicy chicken nuggets, just a little tougher. The app was about $10.99 (but make sure you check in to get a free one). For my entree I had to sh and chips (pretty good) for $18.99 and my brother had a southwestern salad for $17.99. We had a alcoholic daiquiri for $20 as well.   I would recommend for a one time thing but it's nothing to keep coming back for.",

Dinner choices were chicken with rice, brisket, fried shrimp, shrimp cocktail, or chicken strips. Shockingly the brisket was tender, juicy, and flavorful. I didn't order this assuming it would suck. My fried shrimpies were quite amazing but the chicken looked dry and unappetizing.   Granted, you don't come here for the food, but rather for the experience. My friend's lap dance by taco was one of the highlights along with the balloons they tied to her hair. It was a scene from a Pixar movie....my fave part of the night.   Good times, good service, but our waitress royally screwed up on the bill and charged us extra gratuity on top of our bill which turns out to have already included the 15% gratuity and birthday booking charge. Kinda messed up. We had no clue at the time but thought the bill was unusually high and couldn't make sense at the time. It was only after we had left that we realized this waitress had basically charged us 30% tip at the end of the day.   I'd inly go back for a special occasion.",

This is my 2nd time at DICKS and I can tell you that there will be a 3rd time!    So here is it the ratings: Food 3.5 stars -good, better than McDonalds, about like Sizzler.   Drinks 3 stars -  a little pricey and sometimes a little weak.   Cleanliness of bathroom 4 stars -  I didn't see anything to grip about but I didn't do a full inspection.  Paper towels and soap dispensers were full and the bathroom was generally clean and did not stink.   Cleanliness of eating area 4 stars - tables, menus, utensils, salt & pepper shakers, steak sauce bottles and, ect.... Were clean.    Speed of service 3.5 stars -    The whole experience left our group of 6 pleased and we all had a great time. The bill for the 6 of us $219 and here is what we ate, well at least what I recall.    Ribeye steak and shrimp (yummy by the way) Appetizer sampler platter (feeds 4-6 people)  Fire racker salmon  Steak n Shrimp Chicken tenders meal Chicken breast sandwich  Six 14 ounce beers One 24 ounce bud light Order of fried cheese sticks 2 or 3 Fireball & Cokes 1 blow job for my wife (it's a drink)  get your mind out of the gutter.   A decent amount of food combined with a fun loving bunch of curmudgeonly staff members that know how to take a joke and can dish it right back.   This all was ONLY  an average of $36 a person.  Your average may differ from ours based on what you order.  We ordered some of the more expensive menu items.",

She handed us two cards and we went right to the bar with them. Told the bartender we had the cards and all he told us was that we needed to run two separate tabs. Being in the business we totally understood because we were giving him two coupons. As we went to cash out he went to hand us a tab of $26. We ordered a side of fries and thought our beers were free so we really should have only paid $6 with tax. All of a sudden tables turned and this free drink card turned into a buy one get one free card. The bartender handled the miscommunication very poorly and gave us a great amount of attitude. We argued back and forth and when I started to ask for his manager he completely ignored me and then finally told me I could go find her myself. Luckily, the manager came right around the corner. She handled the situation very well and I was very impressed with her customer service. If we were to go back it would be because of her but unfortunately we will not be going back due to that bartender and his AWFUL customer service.

I do think there should be a disclaimer that it is a R-rated place due to the paper hats they make and the sexual inuendos they write on them.  I love the theme of the place....to be a dick to customers.  But no matter how they do their act...you can tell they are still nice people.  I was waiting for silverware and finally our waitress threw down like five sets of ware on the table...\"here-i'm really busy...just in case you need more\".  One cannot get offended at this place or you will just not have fun. Someone from our table wanted refills of his diet coke and kept asking the waitress for more.  She kept rolling her eyes and yelled...hold on I need to go on a smoke break.  (remember to keep your humor)  She finally came with a bucket full of soda and a long straw and said make this last!    hahahahaahahahahahah That was so hilarious.   The food was pretty good for what the place was.  A good Vegas experience and it was a fun place.  I don't think I could work there....I would make too much tip from being the rudest waitress.....lol...hahahhahahahhahahahah  love it!",

About the only funny thing Our server did was steal peoples ca,era and wonder around the restaurant getting strangers to flip the camera off. Everything else was lame. I had to ask 5 times for a refill. Even thou I told him in the beginning I drink fast and would like him to bring me more then 1. The chairs were this rickety park bench that you had to put the smallest person in the middle because it bowed to much in the center. One Guy had to straddle the leg of the table in order to not fall off. I wont be back to this Dicks. I would however highly recommend the one in Myrtle Beach.",

Then she replied, \"Id do him\". Then she started hitting on his little brother lol After that i got the humor of this place. There is an AMAZING baloon artist. She made me a penis hat, and made my boyfriend a stripper hat, and made my friend a hat of two dogs in doggie style!! Amazing time, the food was good, the humor was amazing.

There was a big group of us (kids included) in Vegas for a wedding. We decided to try it out because we heard the waiters were rude and we're a rude family. I loved that they yelled at the kids and called them names. This place was sounding promising...except there's only like 2 options on the menu and everything is pricey. I wanted ranch with my onion rings, too bad! We asked for silverware, no go. The food was SO expensive I was expecting something really good (and I'm pregnant so I'm not that picky) but my burger SUCKED! Everyone's food sucked. I'm cool with their whole schtick about being rude but at least have the nerve to serve decent grub.",

One of the marines at our table got a hat that said \"I'm gay\" then in small pring \"Don't tell my commanding officer\".  Hilarious.

    "text": "So I have been super excited to go to this place for a long time and finally made it out last night.  And I've never left a restaurant so angry!  I was ready to be belittled and have horrible service and match wits against my server.  But instead, I got no service. At all.  The male host seated us at a table by the stage where a live band was playing.  The live band was great, and probably the main reason this review is getting one star (if zero were an option).  We were at our table for about 15 minutes and no one approached us... okay, so is that part of them being \"dicks?\"  Not sure, so we ordered our first round of drinks at the bar.  $20 for a \"pitcher\" of bud light... it was about half the size of any other pitcher I've ever seen.  $11 for a Jameson and coke.  $13 for a Red Bull and well vodka.  Ummm... is this fucking Tao?  The drink prices were outrageous!  I kinda thought maybe that was part of the \"joke\" here, but holy shit.  Make me a stupid hat that says I'm a whore and I'll laugh, but I find no humor in nightclub-like drink prices at this sort of establishment.  We remained at our table for an hour and a half, and eventually the SAME host who seated us came up and asked very rudely who sat us at the table.  And I don't mean rudely in a Dick's sort of way. I mean just plain rude. At this point we were over being neglected, so we headed out. My friend complained at the front about us getting no service and the host who seated was asking why he seated us where he sat us (you follow?).  The other host told us we shouldn't have been seated at the table we were at because the waiter in charge of that table went home sick.  So have another fucking waiter cover the table!  Every table around us was getting service.  How does that even make sense? And the solution the host offered us for our anger?  \"Come back tomorrow.\"  I really really really wanted to experience this place for what it was, but man was this shit.  I'm hoping this was just a rare fluke, but I'm also weary about going back because of the insanity of the drink prices.",

Hey Dicks, I saw your posters, fliers, 20 foot high bill boards all over Vegas proclaiming your establishment and the fact that you are 'OPEN LATE'.  Just what I needed at midnight. I was starving, had walked a mile through the freezing cold of the late December strip just trying to make my way to Mandalay Bay. Then, like a beacon in the night. DICKS!!! posters and DICKS billboards. I thought my hunger would finally be sated.  I was wrong. Boy was I wrong.  You were closing. Closing at midnight. Midnight??!!?? We're in Vegas. You are advertising that you stay open late. Late in any town is 2-3 am and late in Vegas should be 5 am but not midnight. I was forced to eat some chicken nuggets at Mickey D's because you closed early not late. losers",

This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  As previous reviews have stated, this restaurant's gimmick is that all the workers act like dicks, hence the name.  However, there is a fine line between sarcasm, which I can deal with, and rudeness/disrespect.  I love sarcasm.  However, unless you know me really well, I can't deal with racial/ethnic humor.  In addition to the rudeness of the workers there, the prices are completely outrageous!  I had a pitcher of beer and was charged $19.  My pasta dish cost $15.  Are you serious?!?  I should've heeded our food server's advice and gone to McDonald's to order off their value menu.  Bottom line...DO NOT eat at this Dick's location unless you like to be overcharged for food/beer and like being treated with disrespect.  Consider yourself warned.",

When we told the hostess at the entrance we just wanted to sit at the bar she pretended to be offended \"oh gee thanks alot, guess you don't need my help, oh by the way, nice shirt!\" in a sarcastic tone. It was a great laugh to start off our visit to Dick's.  We bought a pitcher of coors light and were given a coors rodeo glass as a souveneir by a girl that said \"I dont really want to give you this but they said I have to because you bought a pitcher of coors light\". The people we encountered behind the bar were great. They all started off being rude and a bit rough with us but eventually warmed up and were alot of fun. Craig was a riot. not necessarily rude, just a goofball with a rough sense of humor. We loved him. Another guy with a shark hat was also fun to goof with. They all took turns sticking their tongues out at us and everyone else that walked by. Rude gestures, comments and smart ass remarks were flying left and right. Just what my wife and I are used to!   We decided to come back again with some friends, thinking they would have just as much fun as us. Unfortunately there were different people working when we came back and they were not the same kind of \"Dick\". Seemed like the rudeness was not an act this time, they were just plain rude. Maybe I was wrong, maybe I had too many drinks in me at that point, but everyone I was with seemed to get the same vibe. We asked the girl up front if we could get a table and have some drinks since there was not enough room at the bar for our party of 6, and she said it wasnt her problem that there wasnt enough room at the bar for us. Ok. So I asked again, well can we sit at a table? She said the tables are for people that are eating. Ok. So I guess we wont be drinking here. She then says we could sit at a \"picnic table\" but would have to get our own drinks from the bar. Ok no problem. So we sit down at the first picnic table we see and a couple of us go to the bar for drinks. The girl that just told us we could sit at a picnic table yells at us \"Not that picnic table, you have to sit at one of those back there in the corner!\" Ok. We get it, we sat at the wrong picnic table and you're supposed to be rude.   So we move to the back corner. Waited for a bit at the bar to order a drink, trying to get someone's attention but I guess because we weren't actually sitting at the bar we did not matter, or they were just being rude? They did not appear to be that busy. Finally got a girl to wait on me and tipped her a buck. We used our 2 for 1 drink coupons that a guy outside the bar gave us, then left.     Will probably come back, but will be prepared for bad service disguised as rudeness.",

Well i tell the bartender if i can have the 2 for 1 deal and he says No you need to have the card. You mean the card that everyone is holding? You want me to go all the way back to the front of the hotel to get the card theyre handing out to everyone? Yes. So i go back and i get the card and come to him with it. He scowls and pours me two weak drinks. The hostess looks at me like what are you doing here? An F for Customer Service and an F for drinks. Will never come here again.",

Anyhow, my husband and I stay at Excalibur often (mainly because our room is always free and we like free) and we usually hang out at Dick's once during the trip. Dick's is not for the sensitive or easily offended. The staff are dicks! That is the gist of this place. It's quite comical and it's fun to be a dick right back to them. In a nice way of course! I always end up laughing my ass of when I am here. The people watching alone is great. They even have sing alongs and do other goofy things. The last time I was there, they had Grease playing on all of the TV's and were making remarks on different scenes. I never realized how perverted that movie really was (like Frenchy with a banana)! The last time we were there, we made new friends, laughed our asses off and before we knew it, 3 hours had gone by!   Of course there is more to the place than just fun and goofiness. The food is decent and drinks aren't ridiculously priced compared to most Vegas prices. The food is definitely not gourmet but it's pretty decent. Dick's is a nice break from the pretentious.   My favorite thing about this place is when people walk up to the bar and the bartender acts like a dick and the people get pissed because they don't get it. I've seen some pretty entertaining arguments!",

This donkey hat includes a line from one of the staff that they think up to \"match your personality.\" I visited during a local paper event. This lady was ridden in front of everyone by a g-string clad guy lap dancer, who does the \"Superman\" on unsuspecting ladies. The ladies that get picked are usually the ones in larger groups. I don't think I've ever felt as uncomfortable.  If you are the kind of person that likes to get berated at dinner, like in Seinfeld when George's dad insists on celebrating Festivus, with the celebratory airing of grievances or have social interactive issues, this is the only restaurant for you. It gets 3 stars because of the surprising quality of the food.",

We had our 13 year old daughter with us so that was nice. We opted for rated R. Lol. The drinks tasted awesome, but the menu didn't have prices. I hated that. The food menu has no discriptions of the food although the names of the food were funny. They only had about 7 things to choose from. If you ask how much something is or what it actually is well you will just get sarcasm. So you order blind. Service was fast but the food was really mediocre. For the price and the little amount of choices you'd expect the food to be at least good. But really denny food taste better. So you pay for the show not quality of the food. Also the portions are small. It was a memorable experience and I recommend it just for the wait staff and the overall experience. But I think the food could use major improvement.",

She was rude and sarcastic to the other tables, which we found to be very entertaining but aside from our goofy paper hats she was super nice. On one hand, if we were anywhere else that would be considered superb service but this is Dick's and we were there for the experience that we didn't get. The menu needs more descriptions. I have food allergies, so it's never a fun surprise to get served something I can't eat and those descriptions could have made our experience better. We shared a crab cake dinner. The crab cakes were the only thing I could eat with that meal. They were ok, not a lot of flavor, no sauce....some sriracha mayo could have done wonders but there was none. I found a piece of shell in mine, which I figured was good because it at least means the crab wasn't imitation krab. I give this place three stars because one positive note was they are generous with the booze in their pina coladas. If I ever return I think I'll skip the food and just order a drink from the bar.",

    "text": "Went here for a fairly rowdy bachelor party--\"what, you are a lady!\" you say? \"Nay, I am a woman with many a male friend. Let me continue my story.\" say I. -- and knew well what I was getting into. I'm trying not to taint this review with how very out of my normal \"happy place\" a place like Dick's is. I'm a quiet bar, good whiskey, long rambling conversation, sort of girl. Dick's is...conducive to these things.  One of our party kept hitting himself in the nuts with the yard long slushie tube around his neck. So that was how the night was gonna be, and these are my friends. I had chosen to be here. So it is in that context, I review Dick's Last Resort.  The Bachelor in question had a blast. So that was the first and foremost goal. Accomplished. Our \"Dick\" waiter was actually quite funny, and had the tact to realize who could take, and wanted to take the brunt of his ribbing, (Hint. He kept hitting himself in the nuts with a 3 foot slurpee. Surprise.) Or maybe he just went for the low-hanging frozen fruit. Either way, he dished it out pretty evenly with liberte and egalete and fraternite, and then focused like a comedic laser. The show was definitely the best part of the experience, and makes me want to hike the review to four stars.  It's the combination of food/beer, and price point that prevent me from doing so. I had hot wings (a side of hooters quips) which were pretty good, the sauce tasted an awful lot like Franks RedHot, and some mozzerella sticks, which were...okay. Damned tasty after I had my second beer. But woah, that beer was expensive. Even for the strip. The whole bill was somewhere around $60. For 2 beers and 2 appetizers, pre-tip for the entertainment. Yeah.  The food wasn't that much more amazing than a TGIFridays type place; less of a frozen gloppy taste but still not worth $60 for wings and mozzarella sticks. I knew it was gonna be spendy, but at the end of a 'meh' meal, it's pretty hard to swallow plopping down a cool hundred for bud, decent entertainment and food you didn't particularly like.   You go to Dicks for the show, but be prepared to pay Strip Inflated prices. I think the next time I go I'll eat before I head out there, and then my budget won't hurt so bad.",

The biggest problem I had with this restaurant was the server, yes I know that you're supposed to get sarcastic service here and he was mouthy, which was great. But aside from being pretty much ignored most the time, even though he pretty much just wandered around most the time.   Near the end of our meal these two girls came in he sat there at the bar talking to them, he completely ignored us after that and he also had another large table of probably seven people, they had to bug him for their bill.   The second problem I had with this was the drinks, I bought the large margarita in the souvenir glass and yes I did order the extra shot, it came out so strong I couldn't drink it. My husband did but I did bring it up to the server that it was incredibly strong and bitter, not complaining mind you just to let them know and all he said was well he ordered the extra shot didn't you?  So all in all, this was not a very good meal save yourself some money and go else where. we wish we would have",

My friend was also fast talked into buying a VERY expensive drink.   On top of that, the food is not even CLOSE to worth the price. They are tiny portions (They barely even would feed one person) and VERY expensive ($20 for 4 hotwings and 2 ribs??) And honestly the quality is pretty crappy.   Also, they charge for tap water.   I went to have some good food at a reasonable/slightly expensive price, and have servers make fun of me. I got none of that.

Hence the pun of this place, the waiters are supposed to be really mean and sarcastic to make you and everyone around you laugh and uncomfortable around each other. I felt bad for the European couple next to us, they apologized for how the waiter was treating us and had to explain it to them how the restaurant functioned. Another reason to love America.

    "text": "On one of our trip to Vegas, we end up accidentally finding out about this place when we walked by and the customers were cussing out the waiter. My husband & I stopped & observe the place. So, after we understood what this place was about we entered & one of the waiter was like: motherfu$**$ come this way & sit the F**$# down. We thought it was funny (we have a sense of humor.) So since were tipsy I said bitch bring us two coronas.   Now, I got the ball rolling & so my husband started getting comfortable & we just started to talk major smack with the couple seated next to us & basically everyone at the restaurant, too. They also put us paper hats & says the out most vulgar funny things. We also get a big roll of napkin to throw at people in the restaurant.  We came here a couple of times; the last time I was here was with my sister & brother in law, we had a blast. I come here for the drinks & entertainment. If you decide to come here, be prepared to get cussed at. You will definitely need a sense of humor.   People are so silly here...!!!!",

I was insulted and teased. They put a hilarious tall white hat on you with the craziest comments on it. The waitress beautiful tall sarcastic and a True dick was amazing. The guys there never stopped being a dick, and one of them scared the hell out of me lol I had the fire cracker salmon that was spicy and delectable. Came w/ veggies and rice. A huge mango margarita that took me an hour to finish. This place lives up to its reputation and name!! Highly recommend!!",

My bf got the brisket sandwich and said it was one of the best he'd ever had. It was a bit over priced too, like everything else in Vegas.

I caught on pretty quick as I looked around and read the hats of fellow patrons some of which said:  \"daddy says I'm more flexible than mommy\" \" I swallow on the first date\"   \"moses popped my cherry\"  We caught on quick when a rude ass server came up and said \"i'm hungover\"  and thru down a bunch of napkins and silverware on our table.  I said \"perfect, so are we!\"  We all got along just fine!  the servers point uninterested at the menus on the wall and drag their feet while they move from table to table.   We had a great time listening to the heavy guy on the mic insult folks and do lap dances.  And yes - my daughter got one.  I could not resist when he said \"anyone having a birthday???\"  I pointed to my girl.  She shook her head back and forth like she was possessed but I didnt care - i kept on hollering!  The lap dance is a funny mockery of a very not cute guy in a very small red thong that is pulled out high on his waist so you can see it when he removes his shirt (all while dancing) to expose a big old belly.  It was comedic to those of us that did not have big man ass in our faces.  Keep in mind my daughter is probaby 5'7\" and maybe weighs 115 pounds and here is this big ass dude bumping and grinding in her face.    She was a good sport in the end and laughed with us as we watched the video.  Her best friend got a hat that read \"easier to get into than a community college\"   The food was actually pretty good for dive grill food and the drinks could use more booze in them but does not matter - we had a blast and left stuffed.

    "text": "I've always been curious about this place. I think it made some list of weirdest restaurants or something like that once. A place where you get insulted by the staff. What's not to like? There  used to be a place we used to go called Ed Debevic's that had really smartass waiters and waitresses that would give you tons of crap about everything. Then there's Pinnacle Peak Patio where they grab your tie, cut it off, and hang it on the ceiling. But that was all back in Arizona. Here in Las Vegas, a friend and I came by to Excalibur to get a taste of Dick's. No. Not THAT kind  of dick - you dick! No fella eating shit. I mean a taste of the  kind of attitude and insults that Dick's is known for. We had just checked out the Lynyrd Skynyrd bar and they were doing some really crappy carry-okie. In my drunken state I kept shouting FREEBIRD! But nobody took me up on it. I then tried to order some blackened Freebird but they said it wasn't on the menu. About the time some big bouncer oaf started heading my way we got out of there and headed for Dick's. If you wanna be a dick, head towards a place where you  can get away with it. So some chump standing outside the place gave us 2-for-1 drink cards and we took advantage of them immediately. There was some band playing a lot of 80's classic rock and hair metal and it was pretty much a good time. When we first walked in, though,  I saw all these girls with white hats - looked like a klan meeting where they forgot to cover their faces. Then I noticed some really goofy stuff written on the hats. Didn't make sense but I already  was 3 or 4 mixed drinks to Sunday and not a whole lot was making sense by that time. The bartender didn't insult us though. I was a bit disappointed. Maybe that was above her pay grade. Or maybe she just had the sense of humor of a TV test pattern. I'll never know. Oh yeah. They sell all sorts of T-shirts that very tastefully and artfully use the name of the place - the type a short bus ridin' 3rd grader would take at least a whole minute to come up with.",

Curiosity piqued, I decided to check the place out.  Dick's Last Resort has a 'schtick': the servers are intentionally rude and make fun of patrons here, and the funny hats are apparently part of the gag.  Sounds like it might be fun, so I looked at the menu; typical of most casino restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip everything was way overpriced.  Ya know, I just don't see the point of paying a premium to be insulted.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants around with surly staff where customers can get a more 'authentic' insulting/rude treatment without paying a premium for it!  On the bright side, Dick's features live music by a decent classic rock/pop cover band-- which can be enjoyed at a more tolerable volume (and with cheaper drinks) from the nearby slot machines on the casino floor",

You can be uptight if you are going to come to this place, so be in a good mood and go along for the ride.  Expect to hear things like, Here's your food, I hope my meat tastes good in your mouth.  Also they will probably make you a nice little hat with something totally inappropriate written on it, so be forewarned.  Overall the food is fine, it's not what I would say is exceptional or surprising.  It's pretty much what you expect.  When you go, you are going for the atmosphere/experience.  I would say this is a great place to take big groups of friends.",

We specifically went in for some good fun but it was the worse. Our waitress did absolutely nothing to entertain us. No jokes (good or bad), no hats, no yelling at us, no banter, absolutely nothing. Spent $40.00 for a mediocre pulled pool sandwich, fish and chips, and iced tea and ZERO entertainment!  All the other waiters were doing their bit but not ours!  On top of that she was incredibly slow and inattentive to us as well as others in her area. Really let me down especially after the great experiences in San Diego, Pigeon Forge, and San Antonio Dicks.",

I applaud his efforts to maintain his character, and provide good service at the same time. Did refuse to split a bill a group of 7, I wish that might have occurred. Food quality was mediocre at best. Ordered the half slab of ribs and chicken wings. Was not really impressed at the quality of either. The ribs reminded me of something slow roasted in an oven all day, and aside from the sauce didn't have much of a BBQ taste to them at all. Wings were overcooked, and then heavily sauced. One lady in our group ordered the margarita with a beer bottle in it. The lady was also quite surprised when the bill arrived and she realized it cost her 28 dollars. Overall, server was cool... wish I could remember his name, but I wouldn't return.",

The waiter tries to put you down but when you retaliate they walk away and you no longer get service because you happen to be quicker and wittier than the staff.

No friendly waiters that are respectful and cordial but they know their limits. The hats are the best part but be prepared to be humiliated. If you're a sensitive person then stay away but other than that give this place a go.  Only reason I give 3 stars is the food and drinks. Food is just your average bar food and is on the expensive side. Drinks are crazy expensive as you'd expect on the strip.

We got the silly hats with the writing on it explaining the silly stuff about us overall it was a fun experience. The food wasn't much to write home about as it was average at best still for the experience of the gimmick of this place I had a fun time.

I was flipped off, called names, and not checked on by staff. It took 45 minutes to get our meal when we went on a Sunday at 7pm. The food was absolutely disgusting. It wasn't cooked all the way, nor did it taste good. I never got refills on my water. And once we were done it took another 20 minutes to get the check to pay.

    "text": "I love wit, mean, & below the belt jokes but this place has none! My experience with Dicks has been Long & Lengthy so I can honestly tell you, that you will be disappointed by the lack of Dick's here. The staff is very polite, but thats not why I came! The jokes are non-existent and they resorted to racial comments while I was here. calling my girlfriend the \"N\" word and thinking its funny is not ok. I think That's when  the bartender realized he crossed the line. In this political climate you should lay off the race jokes, since you are still in hospitality. Management if you would like details on the employee please message me.  I dont want to put this bartender on blast in a public forum since you allow them to joke like this at work.",

In the past, I've heard of the stories about this restaurant, and I've also seen videos how \"out of pocket\" this place is. But honestly, I enjoyed it.  The customer service goal for the employees is to be rude, disrespectful and raunchy. The servers warn you upon sitting down that, \"if you can't handle the heat, get the hell out!\" Upon ordering, the servers observe you and think of the funniest/horrible things to say about you and write it on a hat for you to wear during your meal.   Besides the awesome customer service, their food was ehhhh?... It was lunch time and I was starving, I ordered a steak and deep fried shrimp with fries. The steak was too salty for my liking, and a little too well done for me. The fried shrimp was okay, but the fries were crunchy lol.   Visiting this restaurant was definitely a fun experience, but I don't think that that'd be my go to spot when visiting Vegas.",

As prior Yelpers have stated - you have to have a real easy going sense of humor and not be turned off by cursing or insults, because you WILL be insulted in good fun. My husband took a happy birthday call from his friend right when our appetizer arrived and the server says \"Well I GUESS someone is too busy to eat his f***ing food!\" Also they give you really dirty, suggestive paper hats that again, if you're not a stick in the mud you'll get a laugh out of.",

I told her my husband and I live in California and wanted to do a vlog on the restaurant.  She said it was ok. I told her my husband and I would be doing the volg. I asked her if there's anything we should sign.  She told us, \"Just show up there!\" (The conversation happened weeks before going to the restaurant). I was thinking she put it on her calendar and let someone know. When we got to the place, we spoke to someone who was in charge (maybe a supervisor/manager) and  was clueless.  He called the marketing person and she said she did not anything about it.  The manager/supervisor gave me his phone to talk to the marketing person.

The bartender wasn't rude, but he also wasn't friendly. I ordered one of the frozen drinks that come in a collectible cup, and he told me it would only come in the plastic pub cup instead of the 24 oz pint glass. So, I was already annoyed. I could see the glass pint glasses in front of me, but accepted what he said and took it. I shouldn't have. Instead of a collectors glass, I got a cheap plastic trinket I left somewhere in the casino. The drink tasted fine, though. Sweet and frozen, as expected.   Then, we ordered the basket of boneless wings with BBQ sauce. He told us that the sauce could only come on the side, which seemed weird. We got the food, but they were definitely chicken STRIPS, not wings. And I didn't see any reason that they couldn't have been tossed in the BBQ sauce. They were fine, but not what we were looking for. More like McDonalds with triple the price.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend Dick's. There are better places on the strip with similar, if not better, pricing.",

    "text": "So we went here because of the reviews - they were wrong.  If you get the waiter who is named Oscar, just leave before it starts.  We had a party of 4 and the bench table had another party of 4.  It was mildly funny at first with the rude attitude, but things got uncomfortable when - One of the ladies had her phone out when Oscar was at the table.  He grabbed her phone, stood on the bench seat, took a photo of himself holding his genitals, then told the girl she had a \"disgusting phone\" while rubbing her phone against his genitals - then literally licked her phone.  Things then got more uncomfortable when he wanted a picture with one of the other girls, telling her to grab his moustache as he pretended to grab her breasts (while commenting negatively about their size).  He made not just rude but down right offending remarks to our table (which I choose to omit).  There's a \"rude and fun\" atmosphere and this was just down right offensive and uncomfortable.  The beers my wife and I ordered were brought out and not what we ordered - and when I commented on it he basically told me to shut up.  The food tasted pretty good for what it was.  The last straw was the hat incident, which resulted in my wife walking out immediately upset.  I wanted to ensure the bill was paid, but the waiter couldn't be found  (after walking around for several minutes I told a waitress he needed to come back).  I told Oscar he went way too far and I wanted the bill.  He then asked me what it was that I had ordered.  I had enough of it, and I went off on him telling him to figure it out since he had written it down - and telling him to get the beers he gave us correct on the check.  Which then made things worse as someone at a nearby table got angry at me for waking up their infant in a stroller  (yup, a family of 5 with 3 young children were there) and literally stood up as if he wanted to fight.  My wife and I have a good sense of humor and have no problems with rude and crude, but it went way too far.  The manager spoke to me after the incident and was actually concerned.  She was unhappy to hear about what had happened and she did what she could to set it right.  I am only, hesitantly, giving it a 2nd star because of her.",

If you cant take a joke and are easily offended I would recommend eating somewhere else.   The slushy bar outside it great. I seriously hope they open a place like this in Arizona because I would visit all the time.   Can rate much on the food because all I had were fried pickles. They were good along with my drinks. I will for sure be back next Vegas visit!",

Our waiter was amazing I believe his name was, \"Big Bill\" I will edit if I have it wrong, he may have toned it down for my kids, but either way I wanted to hug him he wrote terribly funny things on the hats for my boys the place was jammed full of adults and he picked on everyone equally... we went to great restaurants the week we were there none compared to this place!!!  The balloon animal guy, didn't get his name (I will call and try) was fantastic, he joked with my kids, I've never been so happy to tip someone 20 bucks for something my kids were going to pop on way to car...  I had only been to this chain in Memphis Tennessee, it was a good experience there, im so glad to have brought my kids here, even if it looked not as kid friendly... those 2 guys made up for our crappy vacation I bugged for at circus circus... thankyou, we will be back for my Lil guys birthday in September...",

Of course if you get a few drinks in you then you won't mind being here lol  They have a stage here they have different shows here. I remember years ago they did a Elvis competition. That was really fun. I am not sure if they still do it or not. This can be a fun time the more people you have with you that you know.  If you have never been here before your in for a treat!

We are a sarcastic bunch who like to have fun with our waiters so it sounded right up our alley.    They were busy but not swamped and with a party of 12 we got right in at 7 pm on a Friday night.  This was the best thing about the place.  It started out fun with the table paper thing but then the waitress came and told us about the menu and walked away, 10 mins later came back and ask if we were ready to order and one of our party said \"We are ready for drink orders\" and the waitress said something rude and left again, came back and left again without a drink order, finally she came and took a drink order (we had now been there 38 mins!).  Half our table wanted to get up and leave but we stayed as anywhere we went we would have had to wait and we were hungry.  When she came back with drinks my husband took her aside and explained that she was not being entertaining but rude because we were about 50 in before we got drinks which is BAD service in our book.  She apologized to the table and we stayed.  The food is only ok and way over priced.  I think her problem was that we were being sarcastic back and trying to have fun with her and she didn't like it.  The next night we went to a different place and the waiter actually thanked us for being so fun!",

Stick with appetizers and alcohol-or maybe just the alcohol-here, because if you're lookin' for tasty, gourmet Las Vegas food, you're better off elsewhere. It's a dim bar/restaurant with plenty of TVs and tables and benches and chairs. The appeal here is to be treated like dicks by dicks.  I've been here twice during two separate trips to Vegas: once for convenience ( I was with a bachelorette and other girls who wanted to eat dinner here before watching Excalibur's 'Thunder From Down Under' show upstairs) and another time for 'the experience.'   The employees act like dicks, making sometimes funny and sometimes corny but all the time off the wall jokes to passer bys, potential customers, and actual customers. That's what you come here for! The service is slow-ish. Your waiter/waitress will analyze you and put a paper hat on your head boasting some seemingly personal, blatant, sharpie-written insight. I did like their fortune cookies. I only got one cause I'm part Asian (the two Mexican girls with me didn't get 'em). Cute.  My first time @ DICK's, I didn't get dunced by their dunce cap; but the second time I got the hat. My \"ombre\" hair was apparently faux pas and not up to par w/ my waitress's standards. What a dick!",

What I have a problem with is using the restaurant's concept to be uselessly lazy. The menu doesn't have any description or ingredients on it... but don't bother asking. Our table didn't have a beer menu... but our waitress just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. A much better solution would be to make fun of me for being one of those \"needy, pain in the ass customers\" then answering my questions. Other complaints: The food was nothing special. The portion sizes were on the small side. They force you to buy the jug they bring your drink in at an added cost (not a huge cost but really?). And the drink menu doesn't even have prices on it.  Overall the experience was lacklustre. Even the paper hats we received to make mock us weren't original. I saw the same thing they wrote on mine when we walked in.",

One bartender was totally oblivious and the other was too busy having a convo with another patron at the other end of the bar. We might have waited a bit longer but looking to my left the couple next to us seemed like they were trying to get the bartenders attention as well and their drinks looked long gone.   With so many places to choose from in Vegas why settle for shit service? Yes, I get the concept of Dick's. I live in Chicago and have been to the one there many, many, MANY times but still when alcohol means money...you better wait on people quick or they'll get to steppin...such as we did.",

    "text": "'But,' you will say, 'It's supposed to be bad.'  Ok, then.  I'm just giving it what it wants.  Maybe it's that I was taken in by the name... we were starving, every place was closed or with long lines, and, well, it was our last resort (more on that later).  Maybe it's that I can only appreciate rude humor and mediocre food when it's not accompanied by an astronomical bill.  Maybe I'm just a sourpuss. But this place sucks.  Later on in the trip, we would have known, with pictures of dirty overweight hairy shirtless bartenders adorning posters encouraging us to come to Dick's Last Resort for abuse.  But only a few minutes after arriving in Vegas, starving, with most restaurants in Excalibur closed and the buffet line with no end in sight, we decided to sit at the bar and grab a snack.  The bar is right next to Excalibur's 'Party Pit', a phenomenon we only saw that Sunday afternoon, where one underwear clad dancer appeared after another gyrating to mediocre rock.  Yes, this IS the highlight.  The bar was tended by two rejects from the school of obnoxious sidekick characters in bad 80s drinking movies, and one grumpy girl who seemed out of place in a land of innuendo, chauvinism, and party pit girls.  The one guy was the shirtless poster guy, leering at women at the bar, pouring beer on himself, and making the lewd paper hats I would later see middle aged women walking around Vegas in later in the week, proclaiming, 'Dick says my vagina smells bad' to all the world.  The other guy apparently gets his wardrobe from the lewd sidekick thrift shop, complete with fake cowboy hat with loop hanging under chin, Hawaiian shirt, and, of course, modified Van Dyke.  The female bartender wore a sweat shirt, jeans, and a scowl.  We got a shrimp entree to share for $20. It had 5 shrimp and some fries.  My companion also got a weakass Malibu and coke for $15.  We left.  I'll tell you what Dick's Last Resort  did leave us with... some lingering entertainment.  I had a mental block over remembering the name of the place, especially when I would agitatedly try to describe the horridness of the place, leading me to develop increasingly bizarre and inappropriate alternates, usually completely unintentionally.  If you met me in Vegas, the restaurant I am describing may have been called, among others:  Last Chance Dick's The Last Dick Resort Last Chance for Dick or Resorting to Dick",

So while you wait 45minutes to be seated, you have nothing to do but watch them wriggle their butts.   The food. It's pretty much disgusting. Not worth the price at all. I took one bite of my Buffalo Chicken sandwich and had to force my boyfriend to trade me for his brisket sandwich. I can usually put up with bad food, but this was beyond bad. It was dry, too bready, badly spiced or something, and the only thing I enjoyed were my french fries.  The only redeeming factors revolved around the atmosphere. Now I've been to the Dick's in San Diego, and the employees in Vegas, definitely take advantage of their location. They were raunchier and ruder, and definitely a lot more fun. Our waiter placed a paper hat that said \"douche-bag\", on our most drunk part member, which actually was spot on we discovered as our trip progressed. There was also a balloon-artist who made the most fantastic spider man hat for a little boy sitting at a table next to us. It was balloon spider man attached to a 1 foot balloon pole, attached to a circular hat piece. It was the most amazing balloon hat I've seen ever.  Probably go again, if everyone else wanted to in my party, but definitely not if I had a big say in it.",

I was hoping the reviews for this place was wrong, but sadly, they were completely right and I wish I would have listened and spared myself the $60 I spend on half assed burgers and over-priced alcoholic drinks.   First off when you walk up, it's not a restaurant, its a ghetto picnic table seating area that looks like a food truck with dinning space. Don't have the expectation of sitting at your own table, no, you sitting with random people you don't even know.   Then they give you a drink menu, with no prices! Worst thing I did was order a drink and not ask, \"How much!\" It ended up being $25 and too over powered with girly sugary crap of alcohol; it actually made me sick because it was too sweet!   They are rude here just FYI, that's their thing.  I had mayonnaise packets thrown at me, my burger was burnt on purpose when I asked for well done, which I thought was fucked up. The waitress humped my boyfriend for no reason and they make you where stupid paper hats that say stupid shit on them which is whatever; part of the gimmick.  Over all the food was horrible. I'd take a McD burger over that any day which is saying a lot because I am a health nut and would never go to McDonalds. The burger patty was not fresh, the lettuce was the cheap, shredded kind and wilted and the cheese was that gross off brand kind you avoid at the grocery store.   If you can, don't come here even if you want the \"experience\", because overall the experience is horrible. You're not missing anything here folks. Take your money, go buy a Fat Tuesday and grab a bite at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, because let's be honest, for $60 that offer is well worth it!",

    "text": "Been going to dicks for years.  Both the San diego Ca and las Vegas locations. This last time we came for my brothers 21st birthday. We know the drill expecting \"rude, sarcastic, and dirty banter\" which we got by the hostess but not really by the waiter. They weren't that busy and it just seemed like the waiters weren't on it. It took almost an hour for us to find out our order had been lost by the kitchen and we would have to reorder our food again. My husband finally spoke to a manager who apologized and said she would have our meal out to us in no time which she did. We were a table 8 so I was pretty impressed that she did have our food out in like 15 minutes. She was very nice and I think felt really bad that we were now gonna be late to our bungy jump at the stratosphere. So she took care of the whole bill, which was very much appreciated!!!  A few things we did notice that have changed since we were here last:  First the menu, they have a \"dinner\" menu which was pretty small with very few options and we were told we couldn't order anything that wasn't on \"dinner menu\" like a chicken sandwich. They only had a burger. The chicken sandwich I guess is on the \"lunch menu\" Second is the paper hats. No one in our party got one even though it was my brothers bday. There were also very few ppl wearing them in the restaurant that night. Almost like they dont bother with them anymore. Third the prices seems to have gone way up. The drinks were super expensive and the food was ridiculous. Almost $20 for a burger. And it wasn't anything special.  All that being said the balloon guy was absolutely the highlight of our experience. I think he was trying to make up for the mistakes in the kitchen. He was vulgar, sarcastic, and damn talented! He is really the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars. If we lived in Vegas I'd totally hire him for all my events. He had us all laughing and changed the whole mood of the table.",

    "text": "Dick's Last Resort is a great place to go if you meet all the following criteria: a) you are buzzed or drunk, b) you are slightly hungry for greasy bar food, c) you have a good sense of humor, and d) you like loud music and obnoxious people.  This is not the place to go if you're not into drinking, or if you're easily offended, or if you have CHILDREN with you.  For goodness sakes, I'll never understand why people bring their children in this place.  Makes absolutely no sense!  The food is pretty expensive for what you get, but that's to be expected.  $17.99 for 4 chicken fingers and fries.  Standard bar fare, with some BBQ options.  Drinks are expensive, of course.  But, there are lots of \"2 for 1\" coupons all over the place that help make up the difference.  The weekend is definitely the best time to go, as the crowd is usually pretty fun and the music being played is decent.  It's always a treat to see TACO, and how he interacts with \"special\" guests is priceless (brides-to-be, grooms-to-be, birthday girls and boys, etc).  They usually throw in a couple dance or singing parties, too, so that makes it fun.  And, honestly, the more sarcastic/rude you are with your server, the better the experience.  It's fun to just be silly and let loose sometimes.  This isn't a \"must do\" place in Vegas, but if you find yourself in the Excalibur or if you are looking for something fun to do during a girl's night out, it definitely won't disappoint.  Assuming, of course, that you understand the atmosphere before you go.",

If you want to have a good time with friends over low-quality, high priced food; In the nicest way possible, this is the place for you.   We came in on a busy Saturday night for a co-worker's going away party, we originally had a reservation for 6pm but didn't show up until close to 7 due to horrendous parking...they STILL sat us pretty immediate and they were crowded too!  Our server was great - in terms of Dick's definition of \"great\". I definitely wouldn't want to bring your uppity mother-in-law here, odds are she won't get the jokes. The servers are vulgar (in a funny way!), they're loud, and the put you on the spot, big time! But they make it fun. If you don't know how to laugh at yourself...again, don't come here.  I'm sorry to say that the food IS outrageously priced...$20 for a burger and fries...what??!   But the decently priced drinks made up for that. All in all if we decide to have another night out with a large group I may consider this place again. Definitely not for date night though..",

As we were parched from the August sun, we decided to grab a drink and take advantage of the deal. We should have known that if they are doing these \"deals\" then something was up.  Yes, we knew it was a spoof and that the wait staff made silly hats for people and were rude, but the female bartender we got at the bar was just plain rude. First, we were traveling with two Germans who did not know what they wanted to drink in the split second the bartender wanted us to order. She was speaking too fast for them to follow and she was yelling at them. This was not a joke of any kind. She kept saying come on! come on! I got other customers! There were no other customers because the bar was empty except for us. I asked her to calm down and explained that my friends were German, but she kept yelling. Honestly, I don't know why we stayed excepted we needed a drink. We finally ordered, but the bartender was just b!tchy and rude and left a truly negative impression on us.  No wonder they have to offer buy one get one free. The place was empty and at least from our experience their b!tchy bartender is part of the problem.",

We heard about this place how they treat you Like Ass Holes and that they make hats out of butcher paper and write stupid shit. So we were like let's Go! Well, only 3 of my family members got a hat and the rest didn't.  Bill was quick to give us our tab. So we thought ok maybe he will do our hats after we pay. Nope!!! I'm a Foodie Person I'm always out and about to try New Spots and if I Get Amazing service you as a Server Get a Amazing Tip. Well, tonight Bill got what he deserved as a Tip $20.00 bucks. For what our tab came out to be Bill should of received about $40.00 bucks. So to end this review I will Never recommend or Ever come to this Place Again.",

It was a blast although there are only so many times I can listen to \"if you're happy and you know it\" without losing my mind.  The only thing was their pricing. Wow, expensive! I dropped a crap ton of money for a very crappy cheeseburger and a large margarita with corona. I get it, you go for the experience but wow.

It's 1am and our last night in Vegas, we walked back to our hotel after many, many drinks. We're walking by they had the restaurant lights down and the multi-colored lights on with music playing!  We decided to walk in and see what was going on. A nightclub. We walked into a night club. I hadn't been to a Vegas nightclub in a years, and I was iffy about staying, but we did. I think I was mostly sold on the drinks. They were big and less expensive than the casino bars.   The dance floor was small and cramped, they had left a table or two out, so we had a place to sit next to the dance floor, but having people bump into your chair wasn't fun. The sound system wasn't great and the DJ needed some work on his music selection and song transfer.   We stayed long enough to finish our drinks and went to the blackjack table instead.  I won't come back for their idea of a \"club\", but I still want to try their food.",

Servers talk shit to the customers, flip them off, throw napkins and cups at the people.  Customers also get to wear these paper hats where each one says something different, like my friends hat said \"I'm as easy as i look\".   Food:  So it took us 45 minutes to get our food and there was only 4 people at our table, 3 of them ordered regular food and i ordered french fries (since im vegetarian there was nothing but french fries that i could eat here)  Everything in this place is fried, i'm surprised the drinks weren't fried too.  According to my friends, food was ok.  I don't think it was worth waiting 45 minutes.  My opinion go to the food court upstairs.  I think Dick's throws away more trash then all of vegas because there's constantly napkins on the floor (tons of napkins) and the covers for the tables are paper.  Once you leave, they bunch up the plastic cups and paper covers and throw it away.  This is just stupid.  Whatever happened to washable table covers and cups?   The only reason i liked this place was because when i ordered water it was nice and cold with ice and the french fries were good (considering i was starving).  This place was not my cup of tea but for others it might be the best.  It is something different then the usual but i don't like getting treated like shit so if you do, enjoy.",

Let me start by saying I have a good sense of humor, but that was bull. We all very clearly ordered one drink and there was nowhere on the coupon that said it was 2 for 1 per person. The drinks were SO weak and came in one of those glasses you get at fast food chains for free water (aka like 5 sips). The food and \"2 for 1\" drinks were so expensive and none of us actually enjoyed any of it. Yes, the hats were funny. Yes, the server was a dick. And I thought it was funny until he answered my question like that. He's not stupid. No one orders two drinks at once. Our bill was about $130 for four plates of gross food and \"2 for 1\" drinks we didn't ask for. Don't be scammed by this place. Spend your money elsewhere.",

However, when someone is asking a question about something on the menu and the waiter is so busy being rude that he cannot answer the question or when one of the attendees is afraid to ask the waiter for a knife or napkins because they don't want to get insulted that is a little ridiculous. In addition, our waiter repeatedly walked away while people were trying to order and I heard him tell a woman at the next table (who was heavier set gal) when she ordered a salad \"why bother?\" she replied that it wasn't a cheat day and he \"That's not going to make a difference\". I'm sorry but that is out of line. The food was overpriced and greasy.

She gave us each a coupon and we specifically asked if we could each use a coupon.  She said yes, even said it's OK as long as it isn't a large party.  (We only asked because the prices were a bit spendy and didn't want to spend that much for dinner)    We ended up sitting at the bar.  When we went to pay, the bartender seemed surprised and wanted to know who told us we could use 2 coupons.  (He did let us use one)   There was a hand written number on the card \"03\" and he didn't seem to have a clue who #3 was...ya right!  Maybe it was his first night...no don't think so.  It's a scam and we fell for it.  On the bright side, food was OK and the bartender was pleasant.    We got Dicked.",

    "text": "This is one of those restaurants where you don't come for the food.    The service is horrible, but thats what you're paying for.  I think that I'm truly jealous of the fact that the servers can say and do exactly what I'm thinking.  I would kill to tell one of my \"customers\" to \"do shit by themselves\" or \"I'm not your fucking mother, take care of it\".  But, until I leave my tower as a princess to become a foul mouthed server at Dick's I'll have to settle for paying for a side of shitty chicken strips with my show.  Well, they aren't shitty, edible and almost good.  But, they're just chicken strips.  In defense of their food, my friends had the pulled pork sandwich and thought it was pretty good.  On our most recent visit, they had a balloon artist, a very X-rated balloon artist.",

    "text": "The concept is cute, but this place is terrible.  I have been to another location and understand the rudeness factor, but our waiter, Alfred, took things too far.  When giving out straws to our table and others, he stated that he kept them by his genitals to keep them warm.  He constantly referred to the kitchen staff as \"his Mexicans\".  The food was below mediocre and both food & drinks were severely overpriced for what was served.  Once again, the concept can be entertaining when done right, but this waiter was too loud and disruptive and ruined a get together with old friends.  There were three of us already served when two more joined our table.  I asked for the check for the first three and was told that they will not split tickets and was presented w/ a bill for all five.  If you feel the need to pay outrageous amounts for unsatisfactory food and terrible service, by all means - knock yourselves out. Stay away!",

    "text": "There is a difference between being funny and crass, and verbal abuse. My party walked out after our terrible experience. First the hostess seated us at the bar, claiming the server for tables was overbooked, not ideal, but fine. The bartender asked, \"What do you want, something stupid?\" to which, with a good sense of humor, we replied just a food menu. He threw the menus at us and immediately asked, \"what the hell do you want to drink?\" Already I could tell this place wasn't for me, but I was willing to roll with it. I said I needed just a minute to decide on a drink when the bartender said, \"well I'm just going to stand here and stare at you until you can stop being such an idiot.\" I was annoyed and murmured something to my boyfriend, when the bartender made another comment that if I had something to say I should say it to his face. At this point I was ready to walk out, I get it's an act they're told to put on, but I'm a paying customer, give me a minute to figure out my drink order, alright? The line was crossed for me though when another couple walked in, and after waiting for a few minutes without being acknowledged by anyone (the restaurant was empty) approached the bartender and asked if they should just seat themselves. At this point he said \"Uh no. The sign clearly says wait to be seated,\" then turned to us and said \"that's as polite as I can be when you're being a complete f---ing moron.\" Totally over the line and inappropriate. If I'm going to be treated like crap, I'm not going to pay for it. Especially at an overpriced, mediocre restaurant.  Unless this experience sounds like an enjoyable time that you're willing to pay for, avoid this restaurant.",

    "text": "I actually came here with Jennifer K (review below) if you want to compare points of view.  Dick's is a place I've wanted to try for a while, the concept is hilarious, and working as a server and bartender back home it's quite amusing that this place encourages being rude to your customers.  The atmosphere is entertaining, bus boys throwing back dishes when customers try to hand it to them, napkins all over the floor, etc.  The servers pretty much come up and shout \"what the f*** can i get you\" haha. Our table was a little more timid than some of the other tables, I was the only one who got a drink -- everyone else waters, and I think that's why the guy didn't really pay much attention to us throughout the night. The other tables who were talking back and such got a little more of the experience.  The food was just ok, I had the Ribs and Chicken which came with fries for around $18. I can't say much about the food, I mean it was a decent portion but seasoning wise it was nothing special and it kind of just felt like we were eating in some cafeteria.  Needless to say, the food may not be great but its worth it to come here at least once for the experience, come to have fun and talk back to your server, 3 stars since it's worth trying once.",

Where the heck does one get gray chicken?!?!?! and it was chewy YUCK! and not only that but the waiter spilled a water all over my friend. I know the name is Dicks and they are supposed to act like dicks but spilling stuff even if it was an accident is unacceptable.

The prettiest girl in our group got insulted the MOST while he ignored the other two.  The humor is a bit dry, not  funny. ANyone can do that! So if you can't handle it, don't come here. Their goal is to become a \"dick\" and they do tell you that in advance.  For my gf, he made her a hat that said \"I ride more than seabiscuit\" referring that she's trampy. For me, he made me a hat that said \"I wipe from front to back\" and we walked around all day with those hat while people try to read it as we pass them. Then when they look at our face, we tell them \"It's True!\" haha! Food is whatever and that's why they distract you by being a dick!",
