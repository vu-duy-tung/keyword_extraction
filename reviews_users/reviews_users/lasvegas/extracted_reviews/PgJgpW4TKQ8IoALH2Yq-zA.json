I would give the hotel a 4 stars review but the buffet will only get two stars and I am very generous. It was a brunch and even though there were 10s of options to choose from, most of the food didn't taste good at all. Specially the meat. If it wasn't for the pancakes and the chocolate cakes the whole family would have left hungry for sure.   We talked to the staff, they refused to give us any credit saying that we could have talked to them earlier, so they could have talked to the chef! But they gave us complimentary two adult buffets to use in the future. But because of the bad experience we decided to skip the offer to avoid having the same bad experience again.",

One thing I liked about the buffet a lot was the seating area overlooking the pool.  The huge windows windows added a nice feel.  Couple things to note that I enjoyed were the oso buco, meatballs, salt and pepper shrimp, and sesame balls (in the chinese food area).  A couple of the desserts like the cheesecake and fruit cobbler was good as well.  Overall, it was an OK buffet.  If you're looking for excellent buffet food you would definitely be better off going to Bacchanal or something.",

    "text": "I play MyVegas slots and I was able to score comp buffet passes to Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay.  We trekked over to Mandalay Bay in the hot Las Vegas sun (Mandalay Bay is one of the last hotels on the strip).  The inside of Mandalay Bay is really nice, lots of glass, really nice decor.  We found the buffet pretty easily as there were lots of signs throughout the hotel.  We arrived there in time for tail end of breakfast.  As it was a Monday morning, I was not surprised that there was no line and it was very empty.  Once we got seated, we looked around the buffet and I was very disappointed by the selection.  There was not a lot food to choose from, but I did try the potatoes (which tasted mushy), bacon (which was tasty, but when is bacon not tasty?), and a few other items (which were not memorable).  Since it was breakfast time, we asked an employee if the could make us an omelet, but they refused stating that they had to get ready for lunch (even though there was 20 minutes left in the breakfast).    We were also able to see what came out for lunch and it was not all that impressive.  Since I was pretty stuffed from the breakfast items (most of it bacon) that I had, I only tried a few things.  I think the best thing was beef dish that they had in the carving station and I paired that with mashed potato and gravy.  They had other dishes that I did not want to try because it did not look very appetizing.  I also toured the dessert station, which seemed a little small.  I passed on the dessert since I was pretty disappointed by all the other items in the buffet.   I am glad that I did not have to pay to eat here and I do not think that I will be coming back to this buffet, especially since there are so many other and better options on the Strip.",

The pasta bar is great - though expect to wait a bit.  Everything else was so-so. The prime rib was a bit too rare for me, but apparently you can have them grill it some more for you (which my aunt did, who knew?).   Overall not a bad buffet experience.

I noted the plethora of negative Yelp reviews but honestly didn't have time to go to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay.  Didn't think it would be as bad as some of the other reviews indicated. As someone who used to go to Old Country Buffet in the 90s with my family, I found this place very recognizable.  The scant selection, cheap salad bar, tasteless carved meats, greasy selections...all redolent of OCB twenty years ago.  The sushi was overstuffed with rice and unbelievably all cheaply-stuffed with cream cheese.   Except this wasn't OCB in the 1990s.  It was 8.99 with free drinks.  This was the prime time buffet of a five star hotel, roughly 33$ per person.  It is a horrific embarrassment of a dining experience, shameful for an establishment of this caliber.  OCB + cocktail shrimp.",

I believe that both of these items are what makes this buffet worth it. The crab for me was too dry but the meats for the most part were tender and juicy! I think the prime rib and the ox tails were the only highlights to this meal, everything else was just mediocre. Service here was great!

Most of the name cards were damaged and the names half scratched out....the salad bar was a poor excuse for a salad bar..old wilty cheap lettuce...no mixed greens....  ..over all we were blown away! at spending almost $40 a person this place should not be in Mandalay bay! it deserves to be in some seedy hotel on boulder highway, at best! the owners of Mandalay need to get it together and update this place and hire decent chefs!!",

Food variety was weak, ribs were overcooked to mush (wasn't even on the bone), shrimp were freezer burnt and sushi was crusty.  The most incredible part was the RAW prime rib.  I'm not talking red rare, the cut was deep purple raw.  The chef apologized to everyone in line and offered to throw the slices on the grill.  I'm guessing they underestimated demand and had to remove many of the roasts almost immediately from the oven.  Service wasn't any better as we were handed off to 3 people and waited 10 minutes to be seated despite there being no line.  Never again",

They seemed to have almost every type of meat that you can think of and various food genres. The specific night I was here it was american, asian, mexican, and italian. They had a sushi station setup and custom ordered pasta. The dessert bar is also quite extravagant. It was full of various pies, cake, puddings, soft serve ice cream, and cookies, both regular and sugar free.   The only reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars was the table service was a little slow to get things like drinks and extra silverware, but it was no way impactful enough for me to not come back the next time I am here.",

The crab legs were soggy and the meat inside just fell apart and didn't taste good. I was out of water for a good portion of the meal. I stood at the meat section where they cut you out a portion and was ignored for quite a few minutes before I gave up on getting turkey. After the crab legs, I pretty much lost my appetite. Overall, they were friendly but it was not worth the time or money. I expected better because it was located in Mandalay Bay.",

I hope this is as close as I get to knowing what prison food taste like. Seriously worst meal of my life! Stay far away! Mandalay Bay Management needs to eat here! And not the ones who work at the restaurant! If serious changes are not made to meet half way with the competitors like: The Wicked Buffet, World Carnival, Bellagio etc then the Bayside Buffet should be closed! The food had no taste and/or dry and/or ingredients don't mix well together. Are the kitchen staff being forced to cook against their will? That could explain the bad food then! This is a bad reflection on American Buffets. Just think of the poor foreign tourist! My personal favorite buffet is The Wicked Buffet. Oh, And you know how much we spent on this bad meal? $77 including tip! We got robbed!",

Eventually I figured out that if I dug crab legs out from the bottom of the pile and avoided the legs on top they'd be warm, but by then I was pretty full.  Like all the other buffets we tried in Vegas, they expect you to tip before you are even seated.  If you don't want to give a gratuity for service you have not received and you don't carry cash, the only option you have is to stiff the server.",

You pay when you enter, and after I paid, the cashier wrote the amount of my tip (determined before we sat down) on a receipt in huge black letters with a sharpie.  Then they walked us to the table and left the slip on the table to be collected by our server when she arrived with the tip prominently displayed.  It left the impression that you had better leave a big tip in advance in order to get good service and/or if you leave a bad tip, everybody will know.  For the record, we left exactly 15%.  When I questioned them, they were very defensive and condescending.  Despite the poor start, the food was good and our server was great (and we left an appropriate additional tip).",

Black fungus on the stone crab claws, frozen, overcooked to mush vegetables, glutenous fried rice in the Chinese food section, roast chicken quarters that looked dry, the same sparse pieces baking away all night under the heat lamp, butterflied, deep fried prawns with mushy interior, cantaloupe and watermelon on the verge of crossing over to the bad side, chicken cordon bleu that was less flavorful than I can imagine coming from any brand in the Safeway frozen food aisle.

I figure it willbe more worth it and my guests won't complain about not having enough to eat. I had about 70 people in my party so to guarantee that we all sat together, I had to folk up $250 for the deposit which doesn't go towards my food.  Since it was my first meal of my hectic day, I wasn't that hungry so basically I picked at stuff. I definitely got some steam crab legs. They were relly good, not that salty, but some may differ. I had some pasta that was freshly made at the pasta station. I ate some Bourbon beef and it was good since I don't usually eat meat. And I can't remember what I ate before my desserts. I must have not ate a lot, The buffet is setup with three sections, 1 for the meat and stuff, the other for ethnics foods/seafood, and the for dessert. If you didn't know better, you will miss the 2nd section since it is behind a wall. I found that the food was pretty good, for $26.99 a head, it wasn't all that bad. I might have spent more if I chose a sit down dinner.  PROS: -food is good -decent price -very roomy -great service  CONS: -no signs of stating where all the sections were. -had to pay a deposit to reserve seats",

    "text": "Given this is my third meal here during this stay (and I got one more to go), it warrants a review.  If what you have in mind is a grand spread like Bellagio or Wynn, or Ceasars, it's a far cry.  Think more like when a hometown diner puts up a sign for \"all you can eat\" and adds some cheap $7.99 platter of late night Vegas style prime rib and super skinny crab legs.    That said, it's a very convenient place if you're staying here to grab a quick light bite.  Yes, light, because since thanks to the warning of other yelpers I had appropriately lowered my expectations significantly, and can appreciate that I can get some steamed rice with lightly stir-fried or steamed veggies, and some meats that don't come with sauces, and platters of fresh fruits and berries in the morning.  You need a few light healthy meals while experimenting with all the amazing food options here, this isn't a bad place to make a pit stop.  I should mention though that's also because we're staying here, and they've included 2 buffets for every night of our stay... else I may have a very different opinion at $29.99 a brunch.  On the bright side... no 2 hour lines either, just walk right in!  The deals on the Mandalay Bay website, highly recommend it if you're staying over the holidays and it'll at least get you a convenient meal for free.  One more meal here to go... I'll post pictures tomorrow.  Another thing worth mentioning is that the service is really friendly, and people are very nice here.  Will be back... tomorrow!",

The food is no doubt tasty, but I wouldn't say fresh.  After some heavy proteins, I wanted something light and refreshing with a crisp texture...so I went to the salad bar.  I had to sort out through the salads to pick out the foul pieces.  Nevertheless, everything else was pretty good and tasty. I do favor inexpensive buffets with no lines while the food being atleast decent.  The hot coffee was good and a nice touch at the end of my meal.  I stayed at the Delano, so it was a quick and easy access to a decent buffet.  I was satisfied.",

    "text": "Just awful. I expected so much more considering it was at Mandolay Bay.  I had been here once before, years ago, and remembered it much differently.  The food selection was very limited, and the quality of what they did offer was very poor /dried out and tasteless.   The seafood was not very fresh. The pizza was hard yet greasy. The sushi was mushy.  The carnitas were super dry and the tortilla was so old it actually made a sound as I tapped it on the table.   I could go on, but why bother giving anymore time to this place as I feel it's already taken up far too much. Even it being free courtesy of my husbands Mlife comps, it was still way too much for so little.    The one thing I will say is our server Todd was great. He was attentive and always ready to clear away dirty plates and offer refills on my drink. This one star by no means reflects on him personally. Here's a tip Todd - find a new job. Your better then this place !",

    "text": "I visited this location a few days ago on June 7th because I was staying at Delano. I am very loyal to the MGM brand and usually only stay at Signature when I travel to Vegas. After my experience here, I sadly have to say this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Food and Beverage establishment.   I was seated immediately after arriving and went immediately to get food. We received our drinks and from that moment forward, our server did not stop by our table once. There was 2 of us in a small table, so once we finished our first plate, we placed them to the side. We got up and grabbed some finger foods in the meantime since we were out of drinks. Our plates didn't get picked up for over 20 mins and our server was assisting his other tables but just ignoring ours. He looked at our table, which we thought was an indication that he saw everything and never came back. The manager walked by our table and picked up our plates. We finished our plate of finger food and I walked over to the host and informed him of the situation. They said they would send over our server and he again never came. We got up after 15 mins of waiting for our server to come, after we had asked, and left. The most frustrating part about it all, was the fact that other tables were being assisted and ours wasn't.   I spoke with the manager and in the time that we waited for the manager, our plates and drink cups remained untouched. This was well over an hour at this point. The manager said she would refund our buffets (1 paid for and 1 comp). It showed on my room charge that the one I paid for was refunded but according to the MLife desk, I couldn't get my comp back. This was very upsetting but oh well what can I do? We ended up going to a different buffet after this and had a much better experience. It was like night and day!   I will be returning to stay at Delano again. But I honestly am unsure whether I will be returning to the buffet after that experience. I will most likely take the time to walk to a different property to eat at their buffets to avoid another experience like this one.",

The food is still the same taste i ate last time.  The osubuco lamb was perfect from the meat so tender and the sauce just perfectly right.  Snow crab legs or opillo they do have warm and cold as well.   The prime rib got an option if you satisfy for medium rare to well done.   Sushi platter is okay.  Desserr section is perfect too. They have my chocolate rasberry cake ready.  Will keep coming for more.",

    "text": "\"Once again I found myself on my own and going to my mother's annual turkey curry buffet. Every year she tries to fix me up with some bushy-haired, middle-aged bore, and I feared this year would be no exception.\" -- Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)  So disappointing.  Our last morning at the hotel in Vegas and looking for food before the flight home - a long day.  We wanted something in the hotel and easy, so the buffet seemed to fit the bill. It was a decent price and had a wide variety. They let us look at the spread before paying to make sure we were interested. The buffet looked good and we had just missed the cheaper price (breakfast). But, in 30 minutes the food would be changing over, so we decided to go for it.  We paid, came in and sat down.  Our waiter took drink orders and off we went.  There were breakfast items still and some lunch items were starting to come out - but some of the labels were wrong.  I got a plate of breakfast items and went back to the table.  The waiter brought coffee and waters (iced tea for one of us).  Unfortunately, the coffee was bitter - no amount of cream and sugar would help.  The breakfast items were pretty good - eggs, corned beef hash, bacon and blintzes. After I finished my small plate, I went back for lunch items - it was after 1130 - so the new items should be out.  Well, they were, but nothing was labeled. A chef was walking around and slowly adding the signs.  I slowly walked around and got items that were labeled (or were obvious).  There were items like lasagna and meat balls and then a large Chinese section (orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, dumplings, stir fry veggies, etc) and char siu bao.  So everything I got was okay so-so. The steamed pork bun was good on the inside, but the dough was wrong on the outside. Never let the white-folk make the Asian food.  I can hear my sister-in-laws Mom telling me that I shoul not have expected much.  Anyway, the food did not sit well in my stomach the rest of the day and on my flight.  Not a buffet I would go to again and certainly not worth the price. But in a pinch, if it was your only choice, give it a shot.  My standards are just higher than theirs.",

It ROCKS, brisket, Tri-Tip steak, fresh everything and it's $5 less than this dump.",

I had the new york steak, cheese lasagna, lamb osso bucco, swai fish rolls, sushi, trout in the asian section, pork carnitas, beans.... none of those mentioned were good. All fell flat in terms of taste, it was all just sad really. They couldnt even cook corn right. Tasted weird said my 3 year old foodie. The only thing that maybe was good was their pasta alfredo. Apart from that, just not worth the money. Go someplace else... drive to chinatown and get much better food for reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Three star is a fair assessment for this Buffet.  $21 per person for lunch.  You can buy meal ticket with credit cards at the Kiosks at the entrance and skip the line of cash payment.  A wide range of selections: seafood, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, fruits and salad bar, breakfast items, bakery and desserts...  I like buffet because there's something for everyone.  And my favorite must-haves are: lox, shrimp cocktail, and cheesecakes.  This one had all.  However, lox and shrimp cocktail were a bit chewy, so were some of the meats.  The desserts were great though.  Decent services.  Drinks came right away.  Dirty plates were taken away fast.  I would probably come back on a very hungry morning, when the line of waiting is not unbearable.",

    "text": "I attended a conference at Mandalay Bay on Wednesday.  Two business associates and I were starving at 1 PM and needed a place to eat.  All of the usual places (Fleur, etc.) had a 45 minute+ wait.  Even the Food Court by the convention center was packed.  Bayside Buffet was dead quiet with plenty of seating.  Despite the fact that the buffet is $26 per person for lunch (WOW!) we chose to give it a try.  First I grabbed what they labeled tomato soup.  It turned out to be the worst carrot soup I have ever tried.  2 spoons of it and that was enough.  I then made a basic salad.  It was pretty fair and the options were mediocre to say the least.  My local supermarket has  better options.  I then tried some panko crusted fish that was inedible.  Service was tough as we struggled to get a drink for someone in my party.  The booth we chose was comfortable and the place was a quiet respite from the convention floor.  So I did relax and the food was edible.  Would I come here again?  No.  Even if it is a business expense I will never justify $26 for this again.",

We got there at 6 and not a lot of people were there, usually a bad sign. Turns out they had a great selection of food and everything was presented well. Service was excellent, again not crowded. Nice mix of expected food; seafood, prime rib, pizza and pastas were augmented with surprises like ossobuco, oxtail stew and pork buns. On the pricey side but we enjoyed our meal more than the reviews would lead you believe.",

It is $36 and not worth it.  I have been to many other Las Vegas buffets, this is proably at the bottom of my list. The selection for all areas was poor.   The food seemed to be old.  It was sitting in the serving trays for too long.  This is probably because their wasn't a large crowd eating everything. Therefore it didn't need to be replaced.",

Loved our stay at Mandalay Bay and decided to give the breakfast buffet a try since we wouldn't have to leave the hotel and we were checking out already.  The one star is for the amazing servers that greeted us inside. They were awesome and they made the experience a little less worse with their warm greetings and smiles. Now as for the cashier at the front, she was extremely rude! I get that there are 2 separate lines for Mlife and non Mlife members but she completely brushed us off as soon as an M life member approached the line. I understand what she said about M life members having some sort of priority, but she definitely could have went about it a different way instead of screaming at us \"they're VIP!\"  I will never ever go back.  As for the food, definitely not worth the $70 we paid for a family of 4. The French toast was hard! I tapped it on my plate, that's how hard it was. I thank our wonderful server! I wish I would have gotten her name! She was amazing!  Mandalay Bay- awesome hotel. Buffet- needs work!",

I wouldn't have given them more than three stars, if that, a couple of years ago, but they have definitely stepped things up in an apparent attempt to live up to the flash of those colored lights and automated kiosks out front. They do eggs/omelets very well, and the meat selection is good. Lots of crab legs. Desserts are hidden on the far side of the dining room, but they are worth the walk. Like most buffets in Las Vegas, they can occasionally leave foods out too long - they either continue to cook in the trays and get too hard or they don't get enough heat and get cold. It's a juggling act for the staff.  The dining room is tropical and nicely decorated.  Bayside is far better than the wretched MGM Grand buffet - within the MGM family it is on a par with the offerings at Mirage and Treasure Island, and a notch or two below Bellagio.",

Good pastries hidden in the back!    Lunch and dinner were very similar.  Mostly the same things, except more seafood at night.  Dinner (Saturday) was really busy - had to wait in long lines, just to see what they had.  Braised short ribs were really good.  I thought the prime rib was too salty for me.  Crab legs were good.  Fried shrimp, baked salmon were excellent.  Rolls were also cold and hard, and the butter was frozen.  They need to warm up their bread products!!  Sushi was so-so.  They also had pizza, asian food (potstickers were good!), various meats, Mexican, etc.    I would go there again, but NOT for 3 meals a day!! But it was a good bargain, so what the heck, right?",

They have an all you can eat -all day- for $35 per person The food was very delicious and refreshing compared to the other 2 buffets we ate at earlier that week (Excalibur and Sahara-were a real crap shoot!!!)  The crab for dinner was awesome and super fresh.  It was definitely worth our money to eat there!!!  The only think I would say is it that the desserts were not as good as the buffet at MGM Grand.

    "text": "This buffet...in the land of buffets....is pretty standard. Hubby and I were able to walk in and be seated fairly quickly for dinner. The dishes they had weren't bad...but nothing really stuck out either. The carved station featured both prime rib and turkey. The prime rib was a bit overdone for my tastes...but it didn't have bad flavor. The turkey was pretty good and the hubby really loves turkey. (He was deprived turkey as a kid at Thanksgiving and other holidays...as his family doesn't like it, so he goes ga-ga for turkey) They did have king crab legs as well as snow crab...I of course went for the king crab and he surprised me and went for the snow crab. The king crab legs were kind of mushy...and just not very flavorful...kind of a bummer for me. He was busy cracking away at his snow crab...and offered me a bite of it. Wow...stand out of the evening! I shamelessly ditched my sad, tasteless plate of king crab legs...and bee-lined it to the snow crab. So sweet, so flavorful...really melt in your mouth goodness in a shell. After indulging in more snow crab than I probably should have, we perused the dessert section. They offered a ton of items including sugar free items...sadly nothing was remarkable.  Service was kind of a miss for us that night. At first the hubby ordered pineapple juice and water...he got his water.....and it took 3 times of us asking for the pineapple juice before it finally arrived. I sat with empty water and soda for a while...but we noticed our poor server had the party from hell...(20 top.....with 15 kids) So we definitely cut him major slack for that and once we got refills and the pineapple juice the service kind of picked up...plates removed promptly enough given the circumstance. All in all it was just \"a-ok\" with only a few dishes being good-great and the rest kind of ....in the middle. I don't think we would return to this buffet only because the vast amount of food in Vegas...but it was cheap eats and a nice time with my guy.",

We hit Bellagio, Paris and Mandalay Bay buffets.  All I can say is this one can be missed.  Two stars for the food, one star for Lena, a beautiful waitress who was the best I have ever encountered at a buffet.  Attentive to every need, kept it all moving, plates cleared, always asking what we needed, why is she even working there. I digress, skip this buffet and head for Paris buffet.",

I asked the server if someone knew if any of the dishes were vegan and she brought me out the HEAD CHEF who gave me a personalized tour of the entire buffet and let me know what was in each dish. He was amazing, and I've never been able to eat like that at a buffet. Many of their dishes were made with canola oil instead of butter and there were loads of options, especially in the asian food section.  Yes, there's plenty of meat and sea food too.",

Everything I tried was good, but nothing just stood out as absolutely great.    They had both hot crab legs (that you crack yourself) and the cold ones that are already cut in half.  Many other dishes to choose from as well.  The deserts were very good.     I noticed that they close this buffet down between lunch and dinner times, so you can't come a little early, pay the lunch price, and have the dinner offerings.    I'd certainly go back if in the area, but I think I liked the Bellagio buffet a little better.",

    "text": "The food is right above average, striking just below the \"appetizing\" mark.  It's pricey to get in, but I guess it's fine.  For plate 1, I had the prime rib, the salmon, the shrimp, and the rice. I know it doesn't seem like much, but I had more later. The prime rib I had was thick. The little edges of fat gave the prime rib some flavor, but overall, it was a little bland. The salmon was well..... salmony? The shrimp is fried shrimp you know, just battered and fried shrimp.  Plate 2! I had the crab legs only. OK, I know I don't eat much at buffets, but the dessert is an exception. The crab legs were not chilled; they were actually quite warm. They were salty, but really delicious. If only I had the stone crab claws. I had sampled one and it was DELISH!  Dessert! I had the chocolate mousse cup, a chocolate chip cookie, a piece of passion fruit cake, and the sugar free strawberry cake.   Dieters beware! Every sweet indulgence at Mandalay Bay will gain you some weight! The chocolate chip cookie was THE BOMB. The cakes were...Meh. The chocolate mousse was heaven in a little cup. Savory, sweet, it's all you can ask for in a dessert.  A view of the Mandalay Bay Beach, nice waiters and waitresses, decent food, and somewhat decent prices make the Bayside Buffet a place you don't want to miss.",

The food has unfortunately been going downhill for the last few years, but I noticed on this last visit that the quality has been improved.

The smoked salmon was the most memorable part of it for me as it as actually cooked/smoked salmon (not the raw sashimi style you see in most buffets). I'd never had it actually as cooked before until here.  The biggest foul for me was I couldn't find the deserts. I don't know if this is because I will still drunk from the Criss Angel show or if I was just not finding it. Usually the desert area is easy to find but alas it escaped me and I went without such.  Ambience wise, the place is really great if you get a window side table. It has its quality to add to the atmosphere.  In the end, not an overly memorable experience. Good for a one time sit down but next time you'll probably want to hit one of the actual restaurants instead.",

On a sunny day it's wonderful to feel the warm sun shining on your hungover, pounding head as you sit there, sans makeup, with your sunglasses on sipping a mimosa (or a bloody mary). Just make sure to guard the blinds/shades with your life or some family with children will come sit nearby and make the servers close them.  PEOPLE: If you don't want the sun on you or your stupid brats, sit AWAY from the windows. I understand when the place is full, and there's no place else to sit. Otherwise, sit in the shade and do not ruin my breakfast. I was here first, DO NOT TAKE AWAY MY SUNSHINE!!!   The food is good. Some of the stuff is icky (french toast, sushi is subpar), but a lot of it is VERY good (chicken fried steak, build your own omelet, all the breads).   Mon-Sat it's $15/person, but Sunday it's $25/person (not including drinks/mimosas). Also, during \"the holidays\" it's $25/person everyday which SUCKS....it was disappointing cuz really, that is the only reason I sleep in Vegas: it's to wake up in the morning and have MIMOSAS!!

At one of our dinners, the place was pretty empty as it was about 8:30. So the few patrons they had they stuck in one section.  Into this section came a family with three very young children. Apparently its ok with the Management of the Bayside Buffet to allow parents to play their childrens videos as loud as they wish, over and over and over again.  That was for the child that was too young to walk.  The other two were allowed to run, scream and race around the dining area.   I have had more peaceful meals at Chucky Cheeeses.  The food is blah. Its the same thing, meal after meal, time after time, year after year.  Since I am a vegetarian I find the buffet grossly overpriced since there is only so much lettuce and bread I can eat.       Hubby does not eat seafood, so that is no enticement for us.  We always stay at Mandalay Bay, so its easy to eat here, and we have many many times over the years, but not anymore.

We simply could not get our drinks refilled for the life of us.  The waiter had a tunnel vision and would not look up as he moped around.  I strained my neck from looking behind my shoulder so much to find him.  I usually like to have a cup of coffee w/ my dessert so I finally found him and walked up to him and asked him for a cup of coffee, even with a pleeeze.  I actually got an affirmation of my order.

The meats from the carving station were good, and the carver didn't scrimp on them.  I would go here again, but I would be very selective about the items I chose.  I would recommend it, with caution.",

We originally scanned the buffet for dinner last night and decided that it was not worth $32 and that breakfast would probably be worth it since it was $10 cheaper. Nope. The eggs were powdered & terrible, the coffee was undrinkable, the pancakes looked & tasted like seats out of a VW bug, the sausage was pink/undercooked and the salmon & roast beef looked like dinner from the night before. I won't even bother describing the oatmeal but it was disgusting too. The omelet chef looked about as excited as someone going through an IRS audit and barely managed acknowledgement when we told him our ingredients.   Mandalay Bay should be ashamed. Retool or put this poor waste of square footage out of its misery.",

I really appreciated that omelets and other egg based foods were made to order instead of being premade like some other places.  I was a bit disappointed by the desserts. They were not very tasty and there could have been some more fruit options instead of just pineapple and cantaloupe slices.   The service was nice however, they seemed a bit rushed taking away our plates the second we finished even though the buffet was not full. But still very nice and amicable.   All in all a great place for lunch to get the day going in Las Vegas!",

Seafood selection is a little small, and they don't cut the crab legs gornyou which makes it a lot harder. The made to order pasta bar is nice, but ask for a smaller serving and definitely share.

And of course let's not forget that the flavors of the world that were 187'd as the second, third, and fourth killings of the night coming in way behind the crab legs.

    "text": "I ended up coming to bayside buffet as a last-minute decision. We were walking through the Mandalay Bay and we saw they had a good deal on the breakfast buffet with bottomless champagne. We figured why the heck we could give it a try.   We walked in the house is very nice and set us quickly. The inside of the buffet was big not as big as some of the other Buffy is that I've been to but we were hungry so we definitely did the trick. We both got the bottomless champagne and I'm extremely sorry that I did because I ended up drinking at 9 AM and I ended up getting sick because I drink too much cheap champagne and I had to go to the room and lay down but that's my own fault.   About the food so for breakfast they had all of the necessities that you would need eggs bacon sausage Hash. I found it interesting that even though we went for breakfast they still had lunch items out. You could still get chicken fingers cheeseburgers even had to stay carving station at 9 AM in the morning I was extremely impressed by that. You can get for lobster and crab legs at nine in the morning it was really interesting to see people actually getting crap legs at 9 o'clock in the morning. Their dessert station was fully open they had cheesecakes and pastries in all sorts of crazy desserts.   As for the taste of the food everything was fine I have no complaints the buffet was just your average run-of-the-mill buffet there was nothing special that set the Bayside buffet apart from some of the other buffet is that I've been to in Vegas.   Overall the Bayside buffet was pretty good the bottom of champagne was a nice complement even know that I got sick but that is my own fault this buffet had everything that you would need to experience in a buffet although I would not say that it was the greatest or the most amazing buffet experience in Vegas that I have been to.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to a buffet experience I would def recommend coming here if not try one of the other buffets on the strip.",

Coffee and pastries in the hotel would cost more than this buffet which features outstanding coffee and the same pastries that we literally paid over 5 bucks for the day prior. The ambience here is nice and the service is perfect. Such a contrast from the Bacchanel Buffet that rates so highly.   We also had a buy one get one free from myrewards that made this an extra good deal. The choices are pretty good for a weekday breakfast. While they didn't have things like shrimp and crablegs they made a super tasty pizza with cream cheese, lox, capers & onions. Brilliant as you didn't have to mess with building something on a bagel yourself and this was probably fewer calories since it was on a thin pizza crust versus the caloric bagel. Not that I was watching calories as I finished with a decadent chocolate filled croissant. Tons of fruit and fresh berries on this buffet. I would definitely return if in the area.",

Was going to give four stars but the low cost pushed to five.   We went for brunch and the food was good and fresh. Lots of staples like pancakes, eggs, sausage, etc. Yes - it not the same level as Caesars buffet which is THE bar for Vegas buffets - but for the price, cleanliness, staff being so helpful and friendly, and simplicity pushed my review to five.   If you're looking for a good meal and to do a buffet on the strip I would suggest coming here. If you want the extravagant buffet experience - and the price - Caesars is the one to go to.",

High dollar like regular buffet on strip. We love the amazing pool of Mandalay Bay, but for sure not its buffet. Guess one can not judge a buffet by a name brand strip casino.",

We stayed at the Mandalay, so there was a bit of a convenience factor in our decision, but I have no regrets.   The food here is solid. We ate at least two meals here and I was very pleased with both. All of the dishes were fresh and very tasty. I loved the fact that there were plenty of crab legs at every single meal, including breakfast. The crab legs were well cooked, with plenty of meat in the shells. Crab legs are almost always a crap shoot because a lot of places buy the cheap ones with all shell and very little to no meat. Not the case at Bayside.   It is pricey, so buyer beware, but that is the case for all the buffets on or close to the strip. You can head downtown for a great buffet at about half the price. That said, you definitely do get what you pay for here, so know that going in, too!   I enjoyed it and definitely recommend it!",

It turned out better than I had expected! The following are what I tried and liked:  braised veal - tender and flavorful ox tails - tender and flavorful Prime rib - sliced to your order - the medium rare slice was juicy and flavorful chicken corden bleu - very juicy chicken meat with just the right amount of melted cheese and cooked ham filling Smoked salmon Seaweed salad Seafood cioppino (not spicy though) Braised green beans Chocolate cookie (one of the best I have tried to date: soft and chewy and chocolaty) Red velvet cake - moist cake and creamy frosting, not overly sweet Cheesecake - rich, creamy, not overly sweet Chocolate fro yo - good  What I tried and thought were just so so:  Crab legs - plain and no tools to help crack the shells, so I gave up on trying Mussells - found mostly shells and had to fish out the meat from the sauce tiramisu - too much cream, which was very bland, and not enough cake, which itself did not taste like much; no coffee syrup detected Bread pudding - tasted like a savory steamed egg dish and nothing like a dessert dish Paella - bland Salmon with panko coating - plain  What I didn't try and care about:  Chinese - egg rolls, fried rice, gai lan, stir-fried veggies, buns, etc.. The selection was small anyway and I had to save room in my stomach for other things anyway. Sushi - there were only two types of rolls and no sashimi other than the smoked salmon slices. Mexican - just some regular looking pulled pork, refried beans, rice, jalapenos, etc. Pizzas & pastas - not a huge variety and looked plain  There were much more items such as green and fruit salads, and way more desserts at the dessert station. but I could only eat so much in one meal...  $30 per person for dinner. A limited selection of wines is included.",

They had almost everything that you can imagine including fruit, bagels, smoked salmon, pancakes, eggs, bacon, omelette station, salad bar, Chinese food, sushi, carved meat, fresh seafood, muffins, cookies, pastries and more!

I certainly would not go out of my way to eat at any establishment at Mandalay Bay, but when you are staying there, it is a good option. Why? Well, breakfast is 17.99 a person and lunch is I think 23.99. The first time we got the champagne brunch for 25.99 (unlimited champagne a $5 add-on) and it was good. Crab legs and lots of seafood options. Was it the best? No, but I kinda like working for my food as I crack the small but really sweet crab legs. Shrimp are farm-raised, not good. My hubby concentrated on the yogurt and fresh fruit and the all-you-can-eat-bacon. When we missed breakfast, there was still oatmeal, grits, and fruit for breakfast.   There is a decent crowd here and when we got by one group of Latino Gangsters (not being racist, I'm just being real, my hubby is black), the staff we're willing to move us to a quieter more peaceful spot.   There might be better buffets, but when you don't want to go far, this is great.",

After coming here numerous times, the salad bar hardly changes. I even found brown rice and whole grain pasta available (shocker, but I loved the healthy selection). Other times I went, the food was good and mostly fresh but the service was lacking. Drinks hardly got refilled and our server even walked by us and cleaned other tables not noticing that all 4 of us don't have any beverages. Another point of notice was that it wasn't even busy (defined as more than half the tables were vacant). Overall though, I love coming to Bayside Buffet.

I got a complimentary buffet ticket and decided to try out the Bayside Buffet. It was not worth my time, empty calories or energy to make the trip to Mandalay Bay for this buffet. Crab legs were dry, prime rib was poorly marinated and not tender in the slightest. The panko crusted salmon was very good, though.  I just returned from a recent trip with my family and ate her again strictly based on convenience and it was even worse than the first time. We also ate at the noodle restaurant at Mandalay Bay the next day for convenience as well and it was sooo disgusting. Mandalay Bay definitely needs to step up their game when it comes to their restaurants.  One star for the pretty view from the back of the buffet and one star for the all you can drink wine, champagne, and beer during dinner.",

Food:  The warm snow crabs just made our day hence the 4 stars....otherwise, we would have given this buffet 3 stars.  Everything else was just OK.  Very nice but OK.  The prime rib was very nice but I liked Bellagio's better for some reason.  From Apple crepes to fried rice, they were all pretty good.  However, the selections were very limited.  I was very disappointment with the eggs benedict...I guess it is standard practice to use hard eggs to keep the shape but hmm...   Price:  $25 I think...We had $20/person vouchers so not sure of the EXACT price...sorry.  Ambiance = Very nice.  Typical casino buffet style restaurant on the strip.  Clean and nice...nothing special.  Service = Umm...  Had to ask for straw, every refill, piles of plates just left alone for a long time.  I think they were short staffed???....not sure.",

    "text": "I'm guessing because the word \"bay\" is in the hotel name, they deemed it necessary to have tons of seafood. NOT that I'm complaining, by any means...  First of all, it's pure genius that at the entrance of this buffet are fast-pay machines??? If the line is long and you don't feel like wasting away in it, jump over to the machine and pay for your meal tickets. You get to skip the pay line, and trot down to where they seat you. One of the things that really kills Vegas buffets for me are the longass lines, so this place immediately got five stars from me. Read on to see why I knocked one off...  Apparently there were at least three wedding receptions going on here (why the hell you would have your reception at a Vegas buffet is beyond me), because the lines to get food were ridiculous. My friend and I also got cut in line by five fat bozos who apparently thought a foot of space between me and the person in front of me meant \"yes please cut me, cuz I'm not hungry either.\" Let me tell you, cutting two hungry, cranky asian girls in line is NOT a smart move. The setup wasn't very genius though. There were about three or four big different sections with food, but people were lining up in ONE long line. It didn't seem to matter if you wanted to go down the whole row of food, or if you wanted just one thing, because either way, people were not about to make room for you. After realizing that we were too small and kept getting trampled on, we sent the bfs in to get the work done.  On to the food!! Their breaded shrimp = AMAAAZING. I'm a sucker for breaded stuff (yea, sue me), and their shrimp was really good. The pasta station also made personalized pasta for you.. tasty as well. Crab meat yum, oysters I was told were yum, pork tenderloin yum... everything was pretty yum. After the giganto crowds diminished, it was way easier to go back and pick my faves out on my plate. But the way it was going when we first got there.. not cool.",

Bayside Buffet was the first buffet I went to and it did not disappoint.  My boyfriend and I got to this buffet around breakfast to lunch transition time. The breakfast options were definitely better than the lunch options because I remember seeing the lunch ones come out and not being as interested. As far as the breakfast goes, they have waffles, pancakes, eggs, sausages, vegetables, you know the usual breakfast stuff. I was a fan of this mainly because whenever I want breakfast, I want all this, but very seldom can you get both waffles and pancakes together along wtih all this other stuff. Not to mention, you usually can't finish all this, but they made the portions buffet size so finishing both waffles and pancakes along with other stuff was doable.   I'm not entirely sure if the coffee was free or not but we got it even though we didn't ask for it. So i'm assuming the coffee was free. I may be wrong on this.",

Since this was a Sunday, \"breakfast\" turned into \"brunch.\"  Ok, so I hadn't really been planning on eating seared scallops at 9:30 in the morning, but sometimes you just gotta go with the flow.  Though I've heard this is not the biggest buffet in town, my husband and I both found more than enough food to keep our mouths and bellies happy.  I ate so much seafood, I thought I was going to grow a gill.  He focused more on the more breakfasty things and reported only good things.  My husband is diabetic and so was very happy to see several sugar-free options on the dessert table.  Service was good.  We took advantage of the champagne because it was included in the cost of the meal and, after all, it was Sunday.  The waiter kept our glasses filled.  I appreciated that, when I asked for more tea, he brought me a whole new pot of hot water and tea bag, instead of just pouring lukewarm water onto my already used bag.  (You'd be amazed how often I have seen this happen.)  The cost was $24/person and that is really quite reasonable for a brunch that includes champagne and this much seafood.   We definitely left happy.",

The machines up front made it quick to pay and we got in pretty quickly considering it was around 7pm on Friday. The waiter was good too, getting us drinks and refills in a timely fashion. The setting was not bad either, pretty new-ish looking interior that was relatively appealing to the eyes.  However, the food is where it started to go downhill. I started with some seafood. The shrimp cocktail was relatively good, but the sauce wasn't very good. The crab legs (cold ones) were horrible, they tasted quite old. The rest of the food in that area looked messy and didn't taste all that great.   The hot dishes on the other side were alright as well. The best part of the meal was probably the roast beef; but then again, I have had better at the other Vegas hotels as well.   The dessert was pretty good, almost saved the meal. But all of this stuff seemed to be coming out of the refrigerator, instead of people actually making it. I know that probably doesn't happen too much in Vegas but just didn't add to the already hurt Bayside Buffet.  Overall, I will probably not come here again. I expected more, Mandalay Bay! I guess the half-empty dining room during peak hours should have been a sign.",

    "text": "The Bayside buffet, one of my favorites here in Las Vegas. Our family seems to mostly visit this buffet every single time we come to vegas (which is like twice a year it seems). Alright, here we go:  Being Asian in all, most of us LOVE seafood and here at Bayside Buffet, you will not be disappointed. You must not compare these delicate crab legs to the ones offered at your local Chinese buffet or Todai's, this blows them STRAIGHT out of the water. For starters, you are offered I believe Dungeonous Crab (SP?), Snow Crab and Alaskan King Crab legs. The crab is fresh an amazing and even more delicious when dipping it in butter (yes, I know I am clogging my arteries, ugh). The shrimp was shrimp, not too shrimpy but not tiger prawn status either.   As for their food selection, its not all that amazing. The hot/warm food didn't really catch my attention. It comparison to Bellagio and Wynn, they lack in a lot of offerings when it comes to international flavor and style. Though I will give them credit for their cook to order pasta station. The chef did however mess up on my order as I requested white sauce vs. the red. But I'm not THAT picky so it wasn't a uber big deal to me. The desert section too seemed lacking. Though I was quite impressed as their self serve ice cream was not the typical regular chocolate and Vanilla. It was a spiced up version of Vanilla and Chocolate and it was just heaven really. I believe it was a Vanilla Custard.  Overall, I give Mandalay Bay a 4 out of 5. Its not quite there yet but its pretty delicious when you compare it to a Bay Area Buffet (from Cali). Service was fabulous, food was delicious, and the atmosphere was just right. Hooray for Mandalay Bay!",

Because of this, I'm generally not a huge fan of buffet style eating. But that aside, the Bayside Buffet isn't half bad when compared against others in Vegas. It has one distinct advantage for sure, FREE ALCOHOL. Yep, they have red and white wine and champagne and it's free. It's not high end but it's as decent as anything you'd be served on a plane. Every other buffet I've been too charged extra for alcohol of any kind. So free alcohol is a Bayside \"plus\". The food was ok, not tremendous but not bad. For seafood lovers they have crab legs, mussels, shrimp, Lox, baked salmon, baked swai (aka..basa) ,  a few different sushi rolls and cioppino (very spicy). The mussels were tender, not rubbery, and the baked fish dishes were both moist, not overcooked and dried out. The shrimp were a good size too. If you're not a fan of seafood, they have pizza (which looked decent), prime rib and chicken . For veggie lovers you'll find things like asparagus and corn on the cob. The dessert section is fairly vast as well with a nice assortment of fresh baked cookies, cobbler, tiramisu, bread pudding, carrot cake, chocolate cake, soft serve frozen yogurt and more. For the $30 entry price you will certainly get your monies worth. So if you're doing Vegas on a budget or simply don't feel satisfied by smaller restaurant portions, the Bayside Buffet just might be your thing.",

    "text": "I want to start out explaining that my mother was recently married, had the ceremony at the Luxor, and we had the reception at the Bayside Buffet with a party of 22 people, which they allowed us to make reservations. It was still $30 per person and since we had a reservation and a large party we paid a $150 fee. We decided to take the party there purely for the convenience of location and the fact that it is UNLIMITED, that's right UNLIMITED beer, wine, and champagne! With a party of 22 people, with the majority being big drinkers this was perfect! We had champagne to toast for my mother and her newly-wed husband. Beer for my uncles and wine for my aunts. Unfortunately, unlimited beer only included bud light. The wine a merlot and chardonay, which were light and fruity. I didn't have a chance to try the sushi, but my aunt (who usually does not like buffets) said it was pretty good and my boyfriend (another non-fan of buffets) said the prime roast was pretty good, but a little fatty. The dessert bar was also pretty good, dont' recommend the ice cream, which tasted more like creamy icee, but definitely do the German chocolate cake and cookies!  I also want to mention Barbara who was our server. She was very patient with us all and was on top of all our drinks and clearing off the tables. Good Job Barbara!",

The layout here is neat in that you never feel like you are in a huge crowded buffet, but it's not so mazelike that you can't find your way around.  I actually skipped the salad which is a first for me and went straight to the crab legs.  They were a bit difficult to eat with no tools at all but they were tasty, not overcooked and horrible like I expected.  All in all a decent buffet, and I hear they have the \"pay once, eat all day\" deal going on here if you want to stick around the Mandalay all day.",

Not quite  I tell ya, it's a catch -22 at a buffet when low carbin' - tons of meats to choose from, ok amount of veggies and yes, the salad bar and a smattering of desserts ( gotta scrape off the crusts on the sugar-free desserts) but you gotta resist the \"real \" desserts, the various startchy's - strong smell comin' from the garlic mashed bowl and the breads ( ehhhh, i usually avoid those when i'm carbin'. )    highlights - the scallops, the osso bucco, italian deli meats and cheeses, meatballs ( yeah , that's right THE MEATBALLS ! ), the turkey, braised short ribs ( very good ), carnita meat. service.  lows - limited veggies ( salad bar ok )   For some reason, i thought this buffet would be inferior to Bellagio and wynn.  I might just rate this above Bellagio but a notch below wynn ( gf still rates Bellagio's desserts the top dog )  cost ( if paying ) i believe $27 on a weekday.  Happy Eating !",

Most of the offerings were the standard buffet fare. It's understandable because these sort of buffets need to be accessible to all people.    The highlight is their dessert offering. They had tiny lemon meringue pies, chocolate chip cookies, macaroons, bread pudding, soft serve ice cream, etc. They even had at least two sugar free cake offerings.

It's affordable though and well, you get what you pay for. It's not bad if you are on a budget. You still get a good selection of food.   The biggest noticeable difference for me was the dessert section. For those of you who have been to the Wynn, you know the dessert has their own ROOM. The selection is huge and almost everything tastes good. The selection here is very limited. I normally gorge myself with lots of dessert and none of it was quite that appetizing. I only took a bite or two out of a few items.   The salad bar is a bit lacking in ingredients. It seemed like there were more options for dressing than there were ingredients for the salad. The best part of the meal was the prime rib. It was very juicy and fatty - just the way I like it. They also had grapefruit in their fruit section. You don't find that often at a buffet. I'm not a big seafood fan and can't comment on the crab legs but my family seemed to enjoy them quite a bit. Oh there is also an omelet bar and the cook will make you an omelet with your choice of ingredients.   I would come here if you are on a budget and don't want to wait at another buffet. I think they are a bit understaffed though. There were quite a few tables that needed cleaning up. If they just cleaned up quicker, they would be able to seat more tables and shorten the wait time. One cool thing about the place is the kiosks at the front where you can just purchase your meal ticket instead of waiting in line to pay!",

The last thing you want is to wait half an hour (or more) in line while the people in front of you decide how they're going to split up the bill between everyone in their groups. Delegate one person to pay for everything for god's sake! Decide how much each person is going to pay later! Ugh. Anywho, the people who run this buffet got smart and set up self-paying kiosks in place of cashiers. Tap the touch-screen a few times, insert money or a credit card, take your receipt and show it to the hostess who will lead you to your table. Genius! Pure genius!

Most of the dishes were good - some of my favorites included the Prime Rib and Cheese Stuffed Blintzes.  The prime rib was a bit over cooked, but it had a ton of flavor; the blintzes were soft and the cheese had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.   The other items were a bit hit-or-miss, but over all a great deal ($23.00 for a champagne Sunday brunch).  If you're staying at Mandalay Bay or Luxor, which is close by, and want a cheap, decent buffet, this is a good option.",

They have 6 automated kiosks in the front entrance where you first walk in making the line waaaay faster than other buffets.  You pay and get seated in no time at all!  Oh how I love technology.  Plus they also have great service and an extensive selection of food.  The guy constantly came and refilled our drinks and took away our plates in a timely manner.  We came here for Sunday Brunch which automatically includes champagne.  Great deal for $23.99!  We got unlimited mimosas and champagne with our meal, along with endless coffee.  The buffet offered king crab legs, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, pork loin, eggs benedict, poached eggs, scrambled eggs, a make your own omelet bar, waffles, french toast, sushi, smoked salmon with capers, beef and broccoli, sausages, mashed potatoes, seared scallops, and more... I hope I didn't forget any of the important stuff!  They also have a nice dessert bar with a wide array of cakes, cookies, tarts, and even frozen yogurt with waffle cones!  Eat your breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert here in this fabulous all-you-can-eat Vegas buffet!",

    "text": "Since there was only a 1 hour wait for this buffet on Christmas night, we came here in lieu of waiting 3+ hours. I know that the shorter wait means the buffet isn't as popular or top of the top as the others, but Bayside Buffet isn't the worst. They have a decent amount of seafood available: crab legs (the warm ones at a different station are a lot juicer and better than the cold ones), mussels, shrimp cocktail, popcorn shrimp, fried calamari, and this medley of seafood in tomato sauce. They also have a custom-made-to-order pasta station and a carving station, but I was too focused on the seafood to venture there. I do have to point out that the desserts were not the same as some of the other buffets I've been to. The soft serve frozen yogurt came out slightly melted and because the bowls next to the machine were still pipping hot from being washed, the soft serve was 70% melted by the time I went back to my table to eat it. Their toppings could be better organized, such as having pumps for the hot fudge and the various syrups. They were available in open containers so it was very messy trying to scoop the sauces onto your soft serve when the serving ladle was caked with hot fudge that some previous child had carelessly dripped into the strawberry sauce. Even though it was Christmas Day and they advertised some Christmas specific items, I didn't see too many of the special items.   We got pretty good service from our server, who made sure our drinks were constantly replenished. They also have the actual metal crab clamps for you to wrestle with for your crab legs, different from those plastic fork looking things that other places hand you.",

The menu remained pretty much the same, but the food prepared was not up to par,  The prime rib was really salty and tough.  The crabl legs was smaller and again real salty. Panda Express would exceed the quality of the Chinese food in that paticular section.  The sushi was chilled so cold that the rice cell apart.  Now I know why there was no line for this Restaurant.  The only reason I gave it two stars was the service was excellent.  Hope they improve on their food.",

Same can be said for this fabulous buffet, which for a reasonable price feature some very good food during all hours of the day.  The breakfast time is especially phenomenal, as the omelettes are delivered to each table after ordering and were in my experiences cooked to pure perfection.  The hashbrowns are usually a buffet casualty as they're butchered by the patrons to just mini sheds of potatoes, but at least here its been crispy and flaked to a way where its still perfect after many diggings.  Dinner is a whole new story as the prices are higher and the food is excellent.  The fish is of some of the best quality (halibut, salmon, skate) and so are the awesome crab legs.  I've seen the occasional lobster tail here even.  Its reminiscent of the Bellagio buffet but with less well dressed folks and a better view of the strip.",

    "text": "I think 3.5 stars is about right.  We came here last Saturday night after narrowing it down to Rio and Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay won out this time because we ate at Rio the last time we were in Vegas.  It's always good to try something new, right?  For about $30, you're treated to a better-than-average Vegas buffet.  I think for about $35, you can eat all day long. I'm not really sure if that requires you sitting in the restaurant all day and eating, or whether it means you can leave and come back to eat whenever you want.  Either way, it sounds awesome; I mean, I think the prospect of having a buffet be your day-long prison is a pretty sweet and ridiculous idea.  Anyway, here are some highlights: + Lots of seafood!  Crab legs! Many salmony salmons! White fishies! Scallops!  Big shrimp!  Yay scavengers of the sea! + Meats!  Chicken legs! Fried! Veal! Stewed! Prime rib! Other many meats for to eat!  Even though I've been trying to eat less red meat, I was like oh screw it, I'm eating well tonight! + The Asian foods:  not spectacular, but I still appreciate it being there.  Sushi, pot stickers, Chinese foods, etc.  All decent-tasting! + Desserts!  Many! All good!  That's saying a lot!  Because I don't have a sweet tooth! + And one of my FAVORITE parts of the meal: they had CHEESES!  I am a lover of the CHEESES, so when I saw the CHEESES I got all drooly and excited and piled all the CHEESES (they's got blue CHEESES, other hard CHEESES that I can't remember, etc.) on my plate, and that was my dessert.  Loved the addition and the tastes of the CHEESES.  I must also note that the dining rooms are very pretty, with dim lighting and a comfortable atmosphere.    So, overall, I enjoyed this buffet a lot, wasn't blown away, but would consider coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Although, if you're deciding on ONE buffet to eat in Vegas, you gotta hit up the Rio buffet.  It is KICK ASS.    Aite, and with that, I'm out.",

At $30 per person, the food was not bad at all. We got there at 12 and they still had breakfast items available as well as lunch and thanksgiving lunch items as well. The food was not excellent but was pretty good and I more than had my fill. The prime rib was so tender, though a little dry, but was still pretty good. All the food was hot and I could see the staff constantly checking the food temperature to make sure all was well. There was so much to choose from but I was able to try everything I wanted. They have a good selection though probably not as much as Bacchanal or the buffet at the Bellagio, but you'll definitely get your money's worth. The staff is attentive and always making sure our drinks were filled and tables cleared. Also there was no line to get in to the buffet. Give it a try if you don't feel like waiting at the other buffets. It's actually not bad at all.",

I told him that I ordered an iced tea, not a lemonade. What does he do? He comes back with another pink lemonade, which I promptly sent back.

Okay, IHOP isn't much better but its a bit better right?  I digress.  The omelets were great, the bacon extra crispy and the crab was delish... I kept my pineapple juice going with some shots of Malibu Rum (thanks to my friendly ABC stores) and the day was looking brighter by the time I finished.

I can't even call this restaurant \"sh*t\" because at least I'm satisfied when I take a dump.  Also the waitress just stepped on my shoes.

    "text": "We loved it. The seating was comfortable. The staff was friendly. For around $20 per person for lunch we all found a wide assortment of dishes we could enjoy.   Peeled shrimp? Oh yes. This has to be one of the few buffets left that offer peeled shrimp. This feature alone is a star in and of itself for the time and effort saved.   We all loved the black bean breaded ball thingies...so good they could pass for a dessert.   And the fresh authentic dessert selection kept us all entertained for far longer than we liked.   Its not the Sterling, or the Baccanal or Wynn, but for the price I don't think it has a rival on the strip especially if you enjoy quality \"staple\" fare that is more about taste than presentation.   As an aside, we showed up about 45 minutes before lunch was to end and the food was still being served fresh. They keep smaller serving plates out which increase the turnover rate.",

    "text": "We frequent MGM buffets due to being MLife players so on a Thursday night we chose to return to Bayside Buffet after a few months when we previously stayed at Delano and loved Mandalay, the buffet all of it but let me say... wow this was more than disappointing & borderline disgusting.   Upon arriving I noticed the floor in the entrance to the buffet was noticeably dirtier than the casino floor, littered with trash, cigarette butts, etc. Which I found odd not something I'm used to seeing at any of the other mgm properties.  While paying by card, the cashier put her hand in front of mine when I went to tip and hit no tip on the computer... why I have no clue when I said \"wait I was trying to tip\" she sighed as if it was a bother she had to restart the transaction she messed up. Idk about you but I tip my servers  so whatever she fixes it sends us to be seated... the hostesses were in no rush to finish their convo before choosing to seat us and proceeds to walk us through the busiest section of the rest and attempts to squeeze us into a small 2 seat table in between two large parties of 6 or more...Did I mention this a buffet? So obviously it would be uncomfortable for not only us but the two other families we would squeeze by each time to get food, she relocated us which was fine. We order drinks they come, we grab food come back, I ask our server for straws he informs me that they don't have them for the environment... I said not even upon request, he said no the only straws are cocktail straws and he would have to go ask a manager if he could get me one.... so I told my fiance enjoy I have worked at a casino I know the types of glass washers that are used im not putting my mouth on those glasses. A few moments later he returns with two straws not cocktail straws appearing Starbucks straws...   Needless to say at this point I had already decided I wouldn't be back the food was good but selection slim and the server was nice but definitely they were understaffed and he bore the brunt of it.  So yay I have a straw I can actually eat, drink, enjoy my meal..... NOPE go to get food come back to dirty wine glasses on our table as if someone walked by and left them. I disregarded but did take note of the large table next to us drinking red wine it wasn't until the clearly drunk guest stood up and loudly stated who's table should I put glasses on next when we had enough. Clearly over served, no one intervened as this man proceeded to return to the bar every few minutes to get new drinks. Mandalay has a responsibility to all patrons to provide a safe environment and that was not it. Seems to me Mandalay has a management or lack of supervision issue. I went from loving the Delano and Mandalay property and now I will never return. I addressed all my concerns with Carmelita who offered to move our table.  like I had an appetite after that no apologies no implication that any action would be taken to ensure other families could enjoy their meals..   I won't be surprised when Mandalay is the next big property to close down the reputation is already tarnished and you guys definitely are not helping in the customer service department.",

    "text": "My friends and I had free vouchers to eat at the Bayside Buffet for lunch/brunch for two days (Saturday and Sunday) and even with the price being FREE, we didn't think it was worth it. Calling it mediocre might even be overstating the quality. The selection isn't that big and isn't exciting at all. The carved beef was for the most part insanely dry and overcooked. My friends asked for the rarest piece the guy could shave off and it was still disappointing. The shrimp were either low quality or over boiled.  Most infuriating for me, was that on weekend brunch, they didn't offer whipped cream or creme fraiche for the waffles. This is a buffet at a major hotel in Las Vegas ... I expect extravagance and to be able to  overindulge in things like creamy sugary goodness on my carb loaded plate!   Being that we had free vouchers, we returned on the second day and all agreed that that was a mistake. The few food items that we found suitable weren't there the second day!!!! And the beef was even dryer on the second day!! If you are visiting Vegas and love food like my friends and I do, don't fall for the free voucher that Mandalay Bay occasionally offers for their buffet. They use it as an incentive to stay at their hotel, and you think, hell yeah, I'm saving $30 per person per day on a meal! But if you love food, this is a waste of a meal while staying in one of the funnest food cities in the country! There are SO many other great buffets and restaurants in Vegas. DO NOT waste stomach space (or god forbid, your money) on the Mandalay buffet. It's disappointing, depressing, and if you paid for it, a rip off. Mandalay execs should really go take a walk and look at their competitions' buffets to get some inspiration for a face lift.",

Four of us dined \"a little\" differently, and none of us had much good to say about anything. If food can insult your intelligence consider yourself scammed. The ONLY FOOD that I found hot, and decent, was the fried chicken. The rest, well......even the desserts, boring, super sweet, and very little that was inventive. For everything else MB does well, this is one big disappointment.",

Two adults and 2 teens and everyone left feeling satisfied, full and highly recommend. Wait staff and all employees we encountered were fabulous. They had cold and warm crab legs/claws and your usual selection of American, Latin, Italian, Asian, carved meats, salad and desserts. They also had their seafood selections and drinks of course. Awesome dinner and we will be back when we return to Vegas",

    "text": "In town for a couple of conventions and the wife wanted a buffet so we looked at a couple and our hotel had a shuttle to Mandalay Bay so we decided to give this one a try. Arrived about 415pm on Saturday night and expected to wait a few minutes for the buffet to open for dinner, however they were still seating from brunch (which is also a couple dollars cheaper than dinner) so we get seated right away our waited got our drinks right away and kept the empty plates cleared.  While the chef was putting out the dinner selections, I heard her tell the staff to make double of everything because they were expecting a large party, (looked like about 200 people when they arrived) and while the wife and I were almost done by the time the large party arrived, I appreciate this forward thinking by the chef and management to make it a great experience for everyone.  If you are looking for a lot of sushi, king crab, oysters or a days worth of food for under $30  you might be disappointed but if you want a reasonable selection of menu items to satisfy different tastes then you will probably be happy with this buffet. It is not the top buffet in Las Vegas but it is a very good choice if you are hungry and don't want to spend $$$$ on dinner.  Some of the highlights BBQ ribs - very meaty Lamb Osco Buco - Super Tender and Full of Flavor Dungeness Crab - Wife Loved it, large meaty pieces Bread Pudding with Vanilla Sauce - Very Tasty Vegetable Soup - Full of flavors Swedish Meatballs - Almost as good as Ikea Panko Breaded Salmon - Super Good Asian Spicy Beef Orange Pork  Highly Recommended",

There is not much sushi variety. But they don't lack meat varieties. We got there early enough to get some chicken noodle soup. But they ran out afterward and they brought out tomato soup instead.  As far as freshness is concerned, some people might give it a bit lower grade.  They are not fancy. You won't find the kind of food display you get at Wynn or Caesars. But you will get a bit more than what a $35 buffet should offer. There is no long line. But it has a good crowd at peak dinner hour. Staff is nice.",

I chose a made-to-order omelette with a side of bacon.  The chef prepared my egg dish as planned, but it came out kind of runny (not fully unexpected given the number of dishes he was making simultaneously).  The bacon was crisp, but more on the chewy side from sitting around for some amount of time.  I did sample a few desserts, and while they looked good their flavors were on the bland side (a chocolate chip cookie and a piece of oreo cheesecake).  I've gotta believe there are much better alternatives within reasonable walking distance that don't cost nearly as much...but for convenience and quantity this place could certainly fit the bill.",

We paid at a self service kiosk but if you didn't want to do that you could pay a cashier.  We got a nice seat by the window and were promptly brought out our coffee and orange juice.  The breakfast selection was O.K.  They could have had some more egg options and potato and/or hashbrown options as well.  We hit up the omelette station and they guy manning the station did such an incredible job we gave him a tip.  I also found a nice salad bar too and made a nice salad and the fruit selection was really good too.  Overall, it's just your standard buffet with some good choices...nothing too special but I would go back again.  It was a fair price at $14.99 per person.",

It wasn't dead, but wasn't swamped either, but it took us awhile to get any water with our meal.  I had to chase down a wait her to get some!  However, he was quite attentive to us after that and even brought us our own caraffe.  The thing that really pulls this buffet down to 3 stars for me was all of the seafood that I tried.  I tried the cioppino, the panko salmon, and some sushi rolls.  I am a seafood fan, but this fish tasted TOO fishy, to the point where I only took a bite of each.  I love sushi, but by no means am a sushi snob (I will even go to a higher quality conveyor belt place and enjoy it), and the bite I took of my roll here made me feel sick to my stomach.  Sushi, in my opinion, should NEVER have a strong \"fishy\" taste, but this sushi did.  If you steer clear of the sushi, though, there is SO much to choose from, and all of it that I tried is fantastic!",

Their sushi selection is lame (four grocery quality rolls) but they had a better Chinese selection (fried rice, show mien, sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, tofu, pot stickers) than MGM Grand. They offered a pasta station where you chose the items and they cook for you (marinara or cream sauce; I chose Marinara and was less than impressed with the taste) Their Italian option is Bleh. Cici pizza looking slices, cheese ravioli and wrapped pasta. The carving station only offered beef or turkey. Shrimp cocktails were on the smaller side and not fresh ice cold. A pretty impressive selection of protein: oxtail, veal, pork chop, ribs, different types of chicken, and fish. As I was staying in the Southside, coming here was easy using the tram from Excaliber. Not sure I would bother venturing here otherwise  unless I was already around here. It's really not that bad of an option, I only came because I had a complimentary pass. It turned out better then expected after yesterday's disappointing MGM Grand Buffet experience.",

I am mostly vegetarian and didn't find a big variety of vegetarian options, which was a big drawback for me. A lot of the food was meat or seafood based. The food I did get lacked the taste it used to be known for and the service was lackluster. My family and I all had queasy tummies that day/night and are thinking it may be from this buffet since it started after eating there.

After yelping a few places we decided on Bayside Buffet!!  It was a little expensive because of the Labor Day Breakfast Special which was $25/person which included all you can drink mimosas and bloody marys. I think usually its less than $20/person.  The food was actually pretty good. They had veal (DELICIOUS and sorry to those I offended), chicken fried steak, crab legs, make your own eggs station, prime rib and all the usual buffet options.  One of the main reasons why I think this buffet gets 5 stars is the amazing view from the dining room.

Yeah, there are TWO wine choices and just ONE beer. 2) When I did get my beer (which happened to be a Bud Light), the guy at the drink station said that he didn't have limes but that I should ask my server.  I asked my server and the entire buffet did not stock limes.  WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE LIMES??? 3) There was a Mexican food station and I got some taquitos (which ended up being crunchy but bland).  I ask the chef behind the neighboring station if they had sour cream or guacamole.  He looked at me as if I had asked him the meaning of life.  He had to call 2 other chefs over to confirm that no, they did not have guacamole (bummer!) and that the sour cream was likely in the salad bar. 4) I asked the lady at the dessert station if she could point me toward some desserts without nuts.  The only ones she pointed to were the sugar free ones.  At the time she was plating some type of chocolate cake and she held one piece of to her face and said \"This one probably doesn't have nuts either.\"  And then she went about her business.  I am so sick of people not finding out for sure or just brushing off the question. I don't ask for fun...I ask because I will literally stop breathing and die if I eat nuts.  They did have some killer garlic mashed potatoes, so it's got that going for it.  Honestly, I love food and I am not that picky, but this place was just not good at all.  Just don't go here.",

    "text": "The Mandalay buffet has gone downhill since I first went here many years ago.  It was once a grand seafood buffet with abundant alaskan crab.  Now its just kinda sorry.  The line for the crab is super long and everyone is waiting for the small stash of crab legs that the staff slowly (strategically) stocks.  The primerib was salty and tasted like one of those \"cured\" wrapped primeribs you get at the supermarket.  The naan bread was more like pita bread, hard and crunchy.    The only things worth getting here was the salmon, pizza, and watermelon.  Unfortunately, thats not why I go to Vegas buffets.    Good thing the entire buffet was comped or else I would have been more upset.",

It's delicious and filling but then you walk around and say, \"hey i didn't know they had (fill in the blank) here!\" and then you try and gorge but you can't truly enjoy because you filled up on scrambled eggs or some wack ish like that.   Food that Ronnie likes: Seafood Paella, Prime RIb, Grilled Steak, Lamb, Cold Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail, Smoked Salmon, Veal, and apple juice.  You should really book mark this. Not this restaurant per se but my likes and dislikes. It's good for reference when we go out on a date.   Just trying to help YOU out kid.",

And you can have it the way you want it...rare, medium, thick, thin, etc.  Pair this with the spicy fresh horseradish and you've got a clear brunch winner.

I was definitely shocked after eating here for breakfast on one my days here on my trip.  The breakfast has your standard stuff (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, bagels, fruits, cereal, etc etc) and only a few extras like smoked salmon, omelets, and waffles. I usually get a little of my standard \"you can screw this up breakfast\" like eggs, bacon and sausage, and then I try the \"extras\" they provide. One thing I always try, if they have it, is the smoked salmon and the reason why is you can tell how good a place is almost entirely based on this item. I love all types of foods... foods that are spicy (almost over the top spicy), subtle, punch you in the face with different flavors that work well together, and salty... but not over the top salty.... and this what happened to the smoked salmon. I can appreciate salty, like a good Shio (aka \"salt\") Ramen, but this salmon was like someone let it sit on a salt block for 10 years and then accidentally poured the entire contents of the salt shaker on it because the cap wasn't screwed on all the way. Wow! Just horrible. I tried several pieces to make sure it wasn't just the one piece, but it wasn't. Pretty much at the point I was done with breakfast and stopped eating. If you can't execute a good smoked salmon, don't even serve it.  I hope it was just a fluke, but to be honest, it would take a lot to get me to come back here.",

I judge buffets by the quality of how they prepare their bacon - so 5 stars for bacon that's crispy and not over-cooked! The Panko-crusted salmon was also a pleasant surprise: moist and perfectly prepared, with a satisfying crunch from the crust. Deduct a star for lukewarm chilaquiles and chorizo (and because this honestly isn't quite a 5-star buffet). But hey - there were chilaquiles and chorizo, which shows the variety of stuff they offered at the buffet. I didn't try the carving station, so I can't speak to that. But I did partake of the chicken-fried steak, which I topped off with country gravy. I didn't try the omelette station either, but there was a big line for it and people seemed satisfied.  The service was good - quick refreshment of beverages, which is more than I can say for my experience at Bacchanal the other night. I think place is a solid 3.5-star place.

My hubby suggested that we just dine at the Mandalay Bayside Buffet since since we were staying there...I immediately agreed.  We arrived at the Bayside Buffet for Sunday dinner which cost $29 per person and there was no line...sweet.  They have kiosk stations where you can pay for your dinner buffet and then get seated.  The buffet area is not as large as I expected but included the following:  (1)  Open Bar Unlimited champagne, white and red wine, and beer.  This was a pleasant surprise, especially since the champagne was pretty good.  Either get your drink at the bar area and/or just ask your server.  (2)  American Section: Baked chicken, steamed and hot crab legs, braised oxtails, ribs, mashed potatoes, potato wedges, vegetables, a carving station for roast beef, turkey, and pork.  (3)  Italian Section: Pasta bar, lasagna, chicken parmesan, sauteed vegetables  (4)  Asian Section: Various dim sums, fried rice, noodles, stir fry veges, orange chicken, etc.   (6)  Mexican Section: Taco Bar, Tamales, Rice, Beans and the fixings.  (7)  Salad Bar: Very limited and messy.  (8)  Cold Seafood Section: Oysters on the Half Shell, Shrimp Cocktail, and limited Sushi  (9)  Dessert Section: Various types of desserts.  My dinner consisted of the steamed crab legs with lots of butter, braised oxtail, vegetables, mashed potatoes, dessert, and lots of champagne.  I tried the roast beef, shrimp cocktail, and some of the other Italian offerings but they were just average....nothing special.  The Bayside Buffet offers a great dinner value that includes your alcoholic drinks during dinner.  I would return for their crab legs and unlimited champagne.  3 Stars!",

It's a pretty good buffet, but eating all three meals here is a bit...much. I totally regretted going for it. But eating one meal here is not so bad.  The dessert section was definitely the highlight, but isn't that always the case? I liked the fruit tarts and mousse. They also have a small cylindrical cheesecake sample that is the perfect size. All cheesecake portions should be that size...seriously. The evening of my battle with this buffet also happened to be the same day that the GameStop convention was being held at the Mandalay Bay. This meant many, many hungry gamers in the hotel. It was extremely annoying to have to wait in a super long line for food at a buffet. I don't even understand why people were lining up, but in fear of being accused of cutting, I joined the flock. But even with the insane amount people (most of them gamers), the service was great.  I don't know if it's worth the price for one meal, but eat enough crab meat and blackberries and you'll probably get your money's worth.  Love, A Recovering Stomach",

The food here was delicious...but I must take away a star for the lack of price negotiating from the group dinning and the small dining area they put us all in.  We would've been better off coming in separately (and we would've paid less).  Although we were guaranteed tables in the same area; so I won't complain much about that.   It wasn't busy when we went, there was no need to even pay the $125 to make an early reservation, but oh well.  Better safe than sorry.  I would've been fine with placing a refundable deposit, but I thought it was a bit of a rip to charge money to make a reservation; I'm guaranteeing them business from a large group of people - we shouldn't have to pay extra for that. Again, though...food was great.  I would definitely eat there if/when I am in the area.",

We were not sure about the price at $20 for lunch, but we decided to take a risk and try it out. We ended up eating for over three hours because everything was so good. The food is great quality. We enjoyed very tender prime rib that melted because it was that good. Also, we enjoyed the coconut butterfly shrimp, lamb, mutton, two types of salmon and many different sides and dishes. The desserts were the best part. There were various individual sized pies, cakes and pastries. We tried them all. We especially liked the coconut cream pies, fresh fruit tarts, raspberry chocolate cake, and tiramisu. But the best part was the vanilla custard soft serve in a waffle cone topped with fresh blueberries. We received outstanding service and had a nice window seat overlooking trees and the hotel pool.

Right after paying for the buffet through a kiosk I went up to a male worker and told me to walk into the buffet to meet a female worker.  The female worker took my receipt, but rushed to place me by a table as if she was in a hurry.  She was not very courteous.  She failed to ask me if I would like to sit in a table or booth as I noticed she would randomly ask other guests that.  In fact, she failed to say anything and placed the receipt on the table and left.  My waitress on the other hand was quite the opposite.  She made sure we were taken care of.  As for the food, there was nothing great about it.  The food was pretty much slightly below average to average.  Yes there was king crab legs and hot butter, but the king crab legs were terrible and I'm a huge fan of crab.  I will not recommend this buffet to anyone.  The rundown buffets in my area taste even better than this and for a fraction of the price.  I do recommend the Wynn or M Resort Buffet.",

PERFECT TIMING.  We were the first ones in and were seated as close to the crab as possible.  We were lucky to be the first ones in, because after we took 4-5 pieced each, the other people dining all filled thier plates with as much as they could possibly take.  the bin was gone in 3 min max.  Having dined at the luxor buffet the day before, the Mandalay was great!!  Everything had its own taste and the service was great for a buffet.  The slice of prime rib i had came right from the middle still alive!!  awsome!!!!  My wife and I were glad we didnt go all the way to the Rio because we were more than satisfied at the Mandalay Buffet and it was cheaper.

My boyfriend and I decided to have brunch with his aunt and uncle and since a majority of places still weren't open yet, we went with Bayside Buffet because we figured they'd have a decent spread of food so none of us would complain!  This is one of the buffets you can use to redeem your MyVegas points on, however those are usually only available between Monday-Thursday. Though I did not use my points on this trip, I was originally planning on doing so as the offer wasn't too steep.   They do have a dedicated entry for M Life members at the Pearl, Gold, Platinum, and Noir tiers on the off chance that the buffet is actually busy, but since it was a Monday morning we didn't need to use this line. You can choose to pay via card, cash, or room key and you do get points for dining here so use that membership card!  The spread itself is pretty small, offering some Asian and Mexican foods, breakfast items, and a dessert table as well. My favorite selections included the seaweed salad, crab legs, pistachio creme dessert, and the brownies (which were sealed so I took them back up to the hotel room).  You do get a server who can offer you drinks that are included with your buffet, such as fountain beverages, coffee, orange juice, and the like. You can also opt to have a small selection of beers and wines if you want.  Overall, Bayside Buffet was an alright place to dine but nothing I would come running back for.   (56/100)",

Orange chicken and roast beef were way over cooked. Flatbread pizzas were not very tasty. It was just so disappointing.  To top that off, our waiter didn't even come by to check on us and we had to flag him down for water refills. It wasn't even crowded. We will definitely not come back or recommend this buffet.

Our server was maybe on break and the time we were half into our breakfast, he finally came around to take and give us our drinks.   The food choices weren't anything special. My husband really loved his \"make it yourself\" omelette.   Besides that? Eh. I'd pass next time.",

Typically I round up, but I'm trying to rate all buffets equally and since I rounded down on the Bacchanal review I rounded down here too! Really, though, for the price this is a decent breakfast buffet. Well especially since it was free with a myVegas reward!  Nice ambiance, bright and airy. Great coffee, and excellent service. Typical breakfast buffet items, scrambled eggs, omelet station, miscellaneous other items. Nothing standout but nothing bad either. Given you would pay at least $5 for coffee and $5 for a pastry, this place really seems like a bargain.  Not something I'd go out of my way for but if you are in the area it's not a bad breakfast deal.",

A little disappointed only because everything about our stay has been very above average from our check in at Delano, fast and friend service on the casino floor and a top of the line suite.  The only part of the buffet that isn't deserving of the 3 stars was the dessert and beverage section. A couple choices of tarts, a few cookies and soft serve ice cream and does not have self serve drinks.",

We wanted to go to a fancy buffet, and we had planned on going to bacchanal brunch for $50, but I read some good reviews about this place for half price. I'm so glad we gave it a try!   The decor is really fancy and we sat overlooking the garden like pool area. Waitresses were attentive and the price included juice and coffee. Me and my friends are still talking about the food days later, this isn't sizzler or hometown buffet quality food- it's unlimited restaurant quality amazingness. Usually when I pile my plate at a buffet I only enjoy a few items, but every single thing I put on my plate was delicious.   There was a section for sushi and seafood, breakfast foods, salad bar, bagel bar with lox, meat carving stations, wok station, omelettes made to order, desserts, and traditional dinner classics.   Unlimited applewood smoked bacon in itself is worth $25 to me, but my breakfast side favorites were: the French toast with pecan syrup, runny poached eggs, and their house made corned beef hash. Dinner side was beautiful, first and foremost there was NY STRIP STEAK (rare) at the carving station. I was super excited about this. The ribs were spicy, sweet, and perfect. We all agreed that the mashed potatoes were our favorite. Super rich and buttery, definitely an elevated mashed potato. I thought I was so full I might die, but then I had a bite of the carrot cake and had to get a piece it was so good. Definitely try this place out, worth $25 because you'll never eat again that day haha.",

I loved it :D  They may not have much of a selection, but Bayside is quality over quantity.  They don't serve crap just to have a huge selection.

Broccoli - Cold and no flavor Pasta bar - watery sauce, no flavor Braised short ribs - MSG all day Ice cream - Non fat frozen yogurt, disgusting All other desert - Tasted like it came from a factory  The only decent thing was the prime rib and the fact that you get wine at no extra charge, that is the only reason it get's 1 star.

Had the Sunday Brunch, nothing great.  Dry prime rib, minimal selections, dessert selections limited to muffins, cakes and cookies.  Hope they would redeem themselves for Sunday dinner...I was wrong.  Same dessert selections.  Saw same ingredients from the brunch buffet used for dinner items.  I can't say weather if it's True...but...I saw sausage from brunch was seen in dinner's paella.  Not a lot of changes from the brunch menu to dinner menu.  Definitely not worth the ~$28 price.",

Lots of food buffet selection- I made the mistake of thinking both sides were the same, but they are actually different so I did not pace myself well.  Favorites were the shrimp, prime rib, corn, and they even had sushi. We also saw lots of people loading up on crab legs.. I guess I should learn to like them!  For us, it was included in the room charge at The Hotel, so definitely worth it. Surprisingly great service too for a buffet- we always had a full mimosa and clean plate.",

Also this buffet did nearly nothing to try to separate itself from even low end vegas buffets which is a shame considering its one of the top MGM resorts in Vegas.   No crab legs for lunch, no made to order waffles or crepes, not even a gelato station.  They did have a made to order pasta station but I found the options of what could be made there half hearted. On a positive their flank steak had great flavor and their carved new york loin roast was well above par as far as buffet carving roasts go.  Also you couldnt go wrong with the large cocktail shrimp.",

It'll be good to go maybe once or twice during your trip. Our deal was free all day passes with our hotel reservation. So we ate at the buffet 4 times and were all buffet-ed out after that.   The service was awesome although they need to organize themselves a bit to make the lines go faster when you pay.   The selection of food might have been small but everything was well made. Crab legs were awesome as well as the braised oxtail, stuffed pasta shells, beef tamales, posole...etc. etc. The only food that tasted bad was the sushi because it was cold like pre-made market sushi.   Tried the desserts and have to say that nothing was worth getting seconds for...except for the chocolate chip cookies.",

Not very conveniently set up. The ramekins for the au jus were on the opposite side of the carving station. The steak knives for the meat dishes were not close to the meat stations.

I wish I could say that something was extraordinary - - I can usually find at least one exceptional item at a large buffet. This place was full of mediocre to poor selections.  The prime rib - - and they gave us a very large portion - - was inedible. I've eaten prime rib for many years and this one had an off taste as if the meat were bad. It was the one item that I asked the server to report back to the kitchen so they knew how bad it was.  Other notables: The orange chicken and the dumplings in the Asian area were cold and doughy and hard. The scrambled eggs had a strange taste; The poached eggs were cold. The large glass of orange juice tasted worse than Tang (if that's still on the market).  Save your money and eat brunch elsewhere would be my suggestion.",

The food selection was not the worst and was not the best (since it was lunch time). I'd say the best selection out there was the prime rib. The drinks, however, was NASTY. I ordered the rasberry tea and it tasted like TAP WATER. I ordered another drink, a sprite and hoping that since it's soda, will not taste bad. I WAS WRONG. Again, it had an off taste.

Smoked salmon was good, and the made-to-order pasta was delish!  however, the prime rib was so freaking dry, and no crab legs for lunch.  The desserts were decent, but dont expect to see fancy desserts like those at Wicked Spoon or Aria Buffets!  Service was average.    I would not go back if i had to pay the full price, but 2 adult lunch buffets for only $3.28....What a Steal!! hahaa",

Coffee greeting you at the table, and a Friendly & Helpful Staff  What I didn't like about it: there wasn't much of a selection, and from what was available the food was so so. I really didn't care for the corn beef hash (in fact don't get it), the hash browns were not fresh, pasta was bland. The pancakes, steak, and baked salmon were so so.

The pasta, made by the chef,  had to be my favorite because they had a good mixture of ingredients to fulfill any of the pickiest of eaters.  I especially loved it when the chef made it his way and knew just how much spice is needed to still keep the flavor of the pasta rather get it overwhelmed.  Most buffets has dried up pizza or some of flavorless stale bread,  but it tasted like it just came out of the oven!  I would definitely recommend  trying this buffet at least once while visiting vegas",

I have both at 4 stars here, but Aria is a bit better, I'd say Aria would be 4.25 and Mandalay a 3.75, rounding both to 4.    Plenty of seating area available, we were in a room by a large window.  While Aria's buffet had a wider selection, there was some cool things to try here that Aria did not have, like the veal osso bucco, the oxtail, and the panko breaded chicken wings.  Nice carved meat station, and I really liked the cioppino soup.  Crab legs weren't as good as Aria though - here they are not pre-split.    Nice variety in the dessert area - wound up getting several of the little cups of tiramisu, they were that good.  This is a very good value for the MyVegas points we used, maybe a bit expensive for paying in cash.",

I've been back twice in the last year and have been sorely disappointed with the size and quality of them. Seems like they are purposely ordering inferior cheaper crab legs to keep costs down. Big mistake! The dessert selection is weak and basically the overall buffet is not worth the price if they can't serve at least one stellar item to want to come back again for. This buffet needs drastic changes for improvement.   Now, on the positive note, i personally can not make a dinner spread like that, so, if i am nearby and starving, i may try it again just to see of any enhancements. Two stars on the vegas scale, three and half if you come from out of state with no vegas type buffets at home.",

My friends were looking through the magazine reading reviews on the various buffets on the strip but I suggested that we go to Bayside at Mandalay Bay. Lunch that day set us back only $19 per head! They had a sign outside that said lunch was $38 which is awfully misleading. I think there would've been a lot more patrons if that sign weren't there. We paid at the kiosks out front and then got in line to be seated.   My meal consisted of: baked chilean sea bass paella cocktail shrimp squid salad calamari potstickers baked halibut smoked trout california rolls spanish rice cream of broccoli tiramisu soft serve swirly (vanilla & chocolate)  The service could've been a little better but I'm not really going to complain. I was happily satisfied with everything I got. The cocktail shrimp probably stood out the most. They were big, fat, and juicy. My friend and I literally stocked up on a couple bowls each. The worste part of the meal? Probably the cream of broccoli. It looked like oatmeal and I could not detect any hint of broccoli in there. My friend said it tasted like instant cream of broccoli. I had to brush the bowl aside after two sips.  We walked out beyond stuffed. We booked it to our room after so that we could change out of our tight jeans and lounge around in sweats. Not only was I happy with the buffet but I definitely think I ate more than $20 worth. Bayside, we shall meet again.",

    "text": "Eh, this buffet was alright. We ate here three times to redeem a couple \"free\" meals included in our stay: weekday breakfast ($19.99), weekday lunch ($29.99) and weekend brunch ($25.99).  I felt that in general, they cooked and seasoned their meats pretty well, but unfortunately I found many of the vegetables and some starches overly salty. Both the lunch and breakfast selection was pretty extensive although I thought that the options at breakfast tasted better overall. I'm normally a super light breakfast eater since it's my least favorite meal of the day, but I liked the variety here. They had your typical American breakfast fare in addition to a Mexican selection. I enjoyed their French Toast sticks, Chilaquiles and was addicted to their crispy tater tots! During brunch, they even offered quite a few meats like turkey, steak, salmon and kielbasa.   As for lunch, my expectations may have been too high, but I was a bit disappointed. Again, all was fine with the meats as one highlight was their lamb Osso Buco. Sadly, I didn't find anything else too special among their American, Italian and Asian selection. There's a station where they'll cook custom made-to-order pasta, but they serve up HUGE servings so be sure to request just a small plate if you want to sample all the other offerings. (During breakfast, they cook fresh omelettes here instead.)  As for the dessert counter, there were various cookies, simple cakes and other sweet bites. I heard their sticky buns were amazing and a must-try!   For the most part, during all three of our meals, service was consistently good and friendly. We received our drinks quickly and the staff constantly came by clearing our empty plates. The buffet appeared clean and well-kept overall, but unless I was given another free meal, I would choose to dine at a different buffet with hopes of better food quality.",

I believe we won some things and came here for our buffet.  I believe we came here around lunch time. Usually when I'm at a buffet, I go for the crabs which I'm a sucker for. I don't ever get rice because rice makes me full super fast and so I try to eat other types of food. If I still have some spots left then thats when I get some rice in me. I like to go for the chow mien as my substitution for rice and thats always a good choice. Whenever I am eating, I have to always get my vegetables because eating food without your veggies is boring. Since this place is okay and I don't know what to recommend you guys, I only tell you what I like to eat and its what I normally get at any buffet place. I have to say that if a person says they are full they are wrong. I have read studies that says theres always room for dessert. So if you have room for desserts then definitely give theirs a shot.  The thing with me giving low ratings to restaurants is that I always give them a second chance. So when I'm in the area again, I will give them another shot. So hang on tight for an updated review in the future!",

For one, the hostess was very nice.  I had asked for a seat at a nice table where there was plenty of natural light.  She sat me in an area I'd never been before.  There were tons of windows. Immediately my spirits were lifted. It was great.  I could picture myself in a breakfast nook with light beaming in. I can't even begin to tell you. it was so beautiful. Anyway, moving on to the food, the food wasn't bad at all. there were many different types of fruits and breakfast beads and pastries. I think I ate a little bit of everything. I was glad that I could get eggs prepared to my preference. I was happy to find there was a good selection of fruit but also that they were bringing out some other add ons like salads and fruit items.  I was not impressed with the wait staff at first.  I guess I felt like they didn't realize that I was there or that I was a newly seated customer or something. I think after they realized that I'd just started dining they were much more attentive. They were much more on top of my drink refills, bussing my dishes, cleaning my many many soiled napkins, asking if I needed any other condiments, etc.  So, things started out a bit rocky but they ended on a good note. I had a nice meal, a very leisurely one in fact.  I liked that things came together. I hope the next time I come I have an even better experience. (Let me tell you, my 1st experience was a complete and utter disaster. HORRIBLE!)",

    "text": "First time ever eating here. It is not a very large buffet menu wise compared to other buffets.  They have a wide range of the usual buffet items but not many item wise.  They have a small assortment of sushi and fruit.  The fruit I did not notice my second pass as it is a little pass the sushi.  Some unusual items I noticed include oxtail and lamb.  Lamb was good. Did not try the oxtail.  Beef from the Asian section was really spicey.  Dessert is one the other side of the room and overall it was ok.  Nothing spectacular.  Regular drinks are part of the buffet.   They also offer an all you can drink alcohol package.  Price point it was a little high.  I might eat here again if I was staying here.  I would not go out of my way to eat here though.",

All the food was fresh and delicious.   We'll be visiting again soon.",

For the same price you could eat at a little bit more edgier Las Vegas buffets, It was nothing special to distinguish this buffet from any other buffet of this type in fact there are other buffets at lower price points with better options (palace station, Studio B, red rock, etc...) That being said this is a chance for Mandalay Bay to really kick things up a notch I'll come back again someday but bot with bated breath. For how much space is actually in the entire restaurant I wish they would do a remodel and really refocus on a central dining experience.",

That is a fairly basic price for a buffet in Vegas. I'll tell you now, I've tried almost all the major buffets in Vegas already, and this one was probably at the top of my list.   I'll tell you now, Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's is my favorite, but price wise and taste wise, this buffet is probably my favorite. It had your basic American food. I'm going to list the different types of food they served, but be warned these are like all the Americanized versions. It was still very good though.   They had: American, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and Japanese. They also had your little basic seafood/salad section. The cold stuff. Dessert wise, it was whatever. They didn't have a lot of great options, but they tasted pretty good for the most part.   Staff wise, I pretty much never got a refill. Basically after getting there, we were never checked upon again. That is the only reason I'm docking a star. Don't get me wrong though, staff there is pretty friendly.",

    "text": "This is a pretty nice buffet. Good selection. The Bayside Buffet is located right off the Mandalay Bay's gaming floor. I've been coming to the Mandalay Bay since it opened in March of 1999. My wife had never been there so we decided to try their buffet. We did the lunch buffet on a Sunday morning. It was reasonably priced at $25.99 per person.   Here are their prices:  Breakfast Buffet: adults $18.99                               children $12.99 Lunch Buffet: adults: $21.99                         children: $14.99 Dinner Buffet: adults: $32.99                          children: $21.99 Brunch Buffet: adults: $25.99                           children: $20.99 Children are considered between 5-12, 4 and under eat free. On holidays the price go up just a bit, figure about five bucks more per meal. This is the one thing I hate about Las Vegas Buffets. They all jack their prices around holidays.   During dinner you can pay $10.99 for unlimited drinks however, this does not include mixed drinks, only beer and wine which is still a great deal.  This buffet has plush surroundings and some of the sections afford a view of the pool and gardens. The pools at Mandalay Bay are amazing and they have crazy pool parties.   The items on the buffet are quite extensive and always fresh. To much to list here. But we did brunch this time which is a great selection, because it has the breakfast and lunch items combined.   The dessert area is nice but not quite as big as some of the other buffets around Vegas. It's great though. They have an ice cream section too.   I have been to tons of buffets in Las Vegas and the Bayside in Mandalay Bay is a nice one. The service is good, the quality of food is good and the customer service is good. Nice buffet.",

    "text": "Decided to check out Bayside Buffet at the Mandalay Bay tonight, so I went into \"My Vegas Slots\" and picked up a free dinner buffet, normally as of this post (10/25/18) a weeknight dinner buffet here would be $32.99 (Sunday-Thursday).  So free is always better as far as I am concerned.  But you must have an mLife players card to get the free rewards.  The Bayside Buffet is located on the main floor of the casino at Mandalay Bay, the buffer itself is not huge, but there is a ton of seating, very comfortable.  Try to get a table towards the back near the windows would be my recommendation, you will have a nice view and be far away from the smoke from the casino, although they have pretty good ventilation inside the casino so not that bad.  This buffet has all the usual suspects, carving station, salad bar, Italian, Latin, sushi, deserts, etc.  along with a few items you may not typically find like Chickpea Masala or Oxtail Stew.  They also have a custom pasta station, made to order while you wait.  Everything was very good and tasted fresh, good quality.  I just wish I had more room to try a few more items.  I alway fill up at the carving station and the crab legs and then not much room for anything else, except carrot cake of course.  Servers come and bring you drinks, napkins, extra plates, clean your table, etc.  You can also pay an extra $10.99 for unlimited beer and wine if you feel it is worth it for you.  Enjoy!",

Usually at all buffets there will be at least 1-2 plates I will like enough to go get again. Sadly that was not the case here. Carved beef was very cheap cut, couldn't chew half of it. Turkey very dry. Salad selections very limited. Service was horrible. Waited for 15mins for someone to pass by to refill my drink then after I waved to a distant waitress she was like \"oh you know this is not my table but I will do you favour and get you drinks.\" So much for the 18% tip they basically push you signing at the entrance.

My husband and I wanted to get out of town before the noontime returning to LA traffic begins, so we thought this would be a quick meal since all the items are ready at the buffet stations. Well, this seems to be the only pro for the establishment.   Sunday brunch was $25.99, including non-alcoholic beverages.   Food was just average, offerings were typical American breakfast items. Waffles, pancakes, French toast, scrambled eggs, sausages, baked salmon, English muffins, mashed potatoes, potato totes, fried chicken, greens, a salad bar, an omelette station but be prepared to wait about 5 minutes. Carving station offers baked ham and strip loin. Really nothing exciting which is fine given the price point but if the items are done well, it will really be worth while. Most items were dried and overlooked. Berries and watermelon were the selling points. The dessert items were uninspiring so I didn't even want to bother with it. Instead we went to Citizen Kitchen, just left of the restaurant on the casino floor, for coffee and a donut; that hit the spot!",

I asked the cashier a simple question and she didn't know the answer but she also didn't even try to find out the answer for me. There is a $7 added cost for unlimited mimosas and i just wanted to know if there is a bar in the buffet that we have to go to everytime when we wanna refill the drink or the server can take care of it and since she didn't even bother to ask her coworkers to figure out the answer I didn't get the bottomless drink option. They didn't have that many choices for breakfast or lunch. I was looking for fruit and they only had melons and grapes and the fruit bowl was almost empty and for the whole hour that I was there, they didn't even refill the bowl. Not a pleasant experience and I won't be coming back here.",

The thing I loved about this place was the wide variety of foods. They do a great job dividing every little island into separate sections. They had Asian, Mexican and American. They also had a salad bar, a great seafood section and a desert section filled with all the goodies you want. I couldn't make up my mind with soo many good options. So I started with some healthy chicken and a cesaers salad. I then got some orange chicken with chow mein and a slice of pizza. After my warm up, i had a very large plate of shrimp cocktail. Im pretty sure i ate over a pound of shrimp by myself. At this point, I couldn't eat anymore, so I sat down for a while and waited for a good 15 minutes before getting dessert. The dessert was delicious. I started with a carrot cake and a cheese cake. I did notice their dessert section had candy decoration, so I asked if I could get candy but they advised it was only for display purposes.  Overall, this buffet was ,my favorite in Vegas. They had the largest variety of food along with a nice setting and helpful staff. I love Shrimp, so this was paradise for me. I highly recommend this buffet in vegas.",

The omelette station is always the choke point but was never an unreasonable wait. The selection of different food from different regions was nice with plenty of condiments and sauces for each type of food. Another truth for buffets in general is that the more often you eat at them the better you will be at navigating the selections to create a meal that represents a value for you and your family. The service met the high standard that I found consistently at all of the Mandalay restaurants.",

The sushi selection was just a few rolls, the rice was also hard so I got the feeling it had been out for a ling time.  The prime rib and cheese blintz were really all I ate and found enjoy able. Pretty sad for a buffet and someone who loves food.  Given free passes again I'd more then likely pass.  If you are looking for a good Vegas buffet I do recommend the Wynn.",

There is something here for everyone, sushi, pasta, Indian, Asian, meat and potatoes, salad, dessert, and more. Was there anything that just knocked my socks off?

If a drinker, this is where you get your value, we ate till full and ended up drinking a total of 8 beers including to-go beers. Where else on the Strip can you get a meal for two and that many beers? Please tell me because I'd like to know.   As long as you understand this is a buffet where food is prepared for literally thousands of people on a daily basis, aren't too picky and have a discount it's totally worth it.",

There was some convention or something because there were a lot of Asian guests practically everywhere on the strip. This buffet was crawling with screaming children, so I actually almost left.  The views from what I saw weren't as beautiful as some other reviews state, so maybe I wasn't in the right area. The french toast, sausage, most desserts, orange juice, and coffee were excellent. Their eggs were gross, especially the \"cheesy\" ones. They have an omelette station that I wish I went for.. From all the great reviews, I did expect better quality food, but it was all mediocre and some foods didn't taste that fresh (which is expected from a buffet). I spent a good chunk of the morning on the toilet after this meal... I don't think I'll be back.",

I don't eat large quantities and I'm grossed out by poor food and utensil handling hygiene that I see a large percentage of diners exhibiting in general, and definitely at buffets. I was in Vegas with someone who does like lots of food and fondly recalled this Buffet from years past ...and we were staying at the Mandalay... so let's give it a shot for Saturday brunch. No real line to get in and we used the kiosk to pay. The breakfast offerings were pretty standard but the lines were long for omelets and carved items. The dining room wasn't busy but the food stations were. Serve yourself items were easier to get to but quite picked over and in disarray. Fruit was old, dry and never replenished while we were there. The only seafood I saw, other than dubious looking cold shrimp, was lox at the bagel station. I had been told there were Jonah crab claws just a year before. The dessert station was good. Lots of cute individual choices that had not been man handled. The beverage server was attentive and dirty plates were quickly whisked away. In the end, I paid a Saturday buffet price for a banana, a bagel, bacon, coffee, juice and some lovely little desserts. Everything else just creeped me out because it didn't look fresh at all. Even the salad bar was picked over and needed servicing. My friend enjoyed breakfast foods, tried some other meat and veg offerings, and was less picky than me about eating things that were in disarray at the various stations. Nobody got sick. I'll skip the buffet, grab a quick snack at a coffee shop, and put my faith in a regular restaurant for a decent lunch next visit.",

We didn't wait opting for the pay kiosk.  The only thing good about this buffet was the service.  Our server was really on the ball refilling drinks and removing plates very quickly.  This should have been one of the best buffets but it was one of the worst we have tried on the strip.  The food selections were standard to sub standard fare (boxed desserts).  I had to ask where the crab legs were because they hide them by the carving station.  Was a bit surprised the legs weren't split and you had to ask your server for the crab cracking things.  The best thing I tried was the baked salmon.  The clam chowder (not sure how they can call it this) tasted like a bowl of flour water and I spit it out.  Other than the salmon I can't remember anything that really tasted good.  Even the crab legs and shrimp had an odd taste to them.  The desserts were very sad.  Most looked like pre-packaged garbage.  They had these lovely waffle cones and I was thinking yea, there's some delicious ice cream like possibly ha'gen daz to put in them?  NOT!  I guess you were supposed to pump the soft watery concoction from the freezing maching into them, I didn't bother.  Don't waste your money here.",

I should have known when the normally long  lines to get in were gone. Went for dinner. What they called prime rib was not. The shrimp were small and mushy. Some of the items were clearly frozen and defrosted. After filling up on mainly rice and potato since everything else was so bad I thought I would have dessert. Saw a wonderful chocolate cake. First bite and it was obvious it had been there for a few to many days sitting. Dry is a nice word to describe it.",

    "text": "Some of the MGM properties offer buffet day passes where you can pony up a few Hamiltons and dine at their buffet morning, noon and night.  We tried the Mandalay Bay's Bayside Buffet recently, where its $43 all-day pricing was set to save us $21 apiece. We planned on spending a quiet day at the hotel, anyway -- relax at the property's 11-acre beach between breakfast and lunch, and playing some slots and visiting the shark reef aquarium before dinner -- so we did not feel \"trapped\" there.  Breakfast went well. The house coffee went beyond our expectations, the bacon was nice and crispy, and you could find all the usual breakfast suspects here like scrambled eggs, waffles and lots and lots of smoked salmon. What's more, there was a surprising inclusion of south-of-the-border Mexcian fare served up as well, including some very delicious tamales I just could not stop eating. Maybe the best tamales I've ever had.  Lunch was just fine. Prime rib and crab legs were now available, as were some scrumptious barbecued short ribs. The selection was decent, but not very exciting -- there was no \"wow\" factor. The flavors were good, but not great.  The choices at this time of day were also infused with many Latin American flavors, including chorizo and beef sausage, a pleasant tomatillo salad, and my favorite tamales. It was, however, a bit disconcerting to see my darling meaty corn husks piled up in the same hotel pan I had left them pining for my gullet several hours ago. Were they the same ones that were put out at breakfast?  Supper was a lot less impressive, though maybe it was because we were still full from eating there twice that day already. Unfortunately, there was nothing new or spectacular offered that evening that we did not see at lunch time.  Sure there were a couple of new Asian dishes and a curry or two, and there was some flank steak (that was just a bit tough to bite), but nothing else really worth mentioning. Even the pasta station that was in full swing that night and had a nice selection of sauces, came up short by serving pasta that not quite al dente.  After getting our fill at breakfast and lunch, we felt another meal here was overdoing it, so we left feeling stodgy after a couple of bites, and ended up quelling our later-that-night hunger pans with a couple of Belgian beers and a some items off the bar menu at Tender in the nearby Luxor.  Did we get our money's worth?  I would happily pay $15 for breakfast here, and even more so if I managed to get in as they were transitioning to lunch (just before 11 am). I also feel their $16 is a fair price for lunch, but again, I would try to make this a brunch visit, and would not eat both breakfast and lunch here, never mind three full meals.  That said, you'd have to value dinner here at $12 at least, to make this one-day pass worth it, and it could be, if you don't mind lots of routine and want to stick to a $42-a-day food budget.",

This time (Sunday morning champagne brunch) it was not really good (which is a nice saying for being nearly \"BAD\"). No line to wait should make us suspicious, but we paid and went in. The server was really nice and helpful and quickly brought champagne and soft drinks. But the food was terrible: not to much choices, not a nice display and the quality really sucks. I tried the usual things, like prime rib, lamb and ham, and I have to say, it wasn't average - it was below. Don't go there, even if you are a hotel guest like me. There are definitely better places to spend ~ 30$ or more for a brunch.",

For the price ($25), I thought this place is almost but not quite comparable to Wynn, Rio and that sort for buffets.  I thought the food here was much better quality than the Luxor Buffet. I racked up a plate of seafood more so the crab legs which were decent. I thought the breakfast was better than most places.    The ambiance was much more open especially if you sit near the window area on the backside of the buffet restaurant. The location of the dessert area was a bit deceiving as it was on the opposite side of the buffet across a middle eating area. The desserts were semi-gourmet similar to the Wynn but not quite as many offerings as Wynn's.   I definitely would come back to this place if I were on this end of the strip.",

For some reason, the quality at Bayside Buffet seems to deteriorate on each visit. However, for the amount of people they were serving that night it wasn't too distasteful.  I've worked for a buffet for many years so I know what NOT to eat so I shunned away from fried foods and salads. I devoured the king crab and what remained of the blackberries and blueberries.  The place was packed with Asian tourists and I most likely was assumed for one. Service was great, I wished people would learn to leave tip even if it's a buffet if not, go take your dirty plates to the dishwasher and wash them yourself.   It was about $27 for dinner and drinks are included which includes an assortment of juices. The dessert choices are very limited. For vegas buffet, I will stick with Paris.",

So a mini-civil war broke out because no one could agree where to eat.  After walking for what seemed like forever and passing every restaurant imaginable we stopped in Mandalay Bay.  We missed the lunch special by 5 minutes and had to pay and extra 5 bucks to eat.    Whatever we paid because we were starving and dying to eat, OMG we were acting a fool at the buffet.  We were there for 3 hours!!!!!!!  Eating, talking shit, and making room is all we did.  We each had several plates and tried just about everything.  I am not a fan of buffets at all, but this place was soooooo good.  Next time I am in Vegas I will be stopping by to grab some grub.",

For good seating, go straight to the back where there are huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the pool.  We chose a corner table and had a great time people-watching.  As for the food, I felt that the selection wasn't very extensive.  I was looking for more seafood and greens to eat, but wasn't given much choice.  There was an Asian, Mexican, American, and Italian food section that color-wise, seemed mostly brown and orange.  I felt that the pastas were overserved - one whole section devoted to pasta + a pasta station = carb overload.  The prime rib was delicious and juicy (the bf went back 3 times for this AND I had a dream about it that night!) and gravy of the mashed potatoes was mouthwatering.  For someone who dislikes anything 'smoked,' I thought their thinly sliced smoked salmon was incredible.  Their tempura battered shrimp was crunchy and crisp each time I went back to get more and I couldn't stop with the seaweed salad as well.    Our server was great and attentive to both drinks and finished plates so that we didn't have too much unwanted leftovers lingering around too much.  I wish I could have tried the crab legs, but I was pretty content with my meal and I'm more than certain that the bf was too.  Nothing particularly spectacular, but nothing really horrible here either.",

Strange thing but the crab legs were dry and almost a powder consistency.  Prime rib was  very good, but I was here mainly for the crab. Disappointed with them. Honestly I have yet to find better fresh snow crab anywhere other than the Palms bistro buffet. Their buffet spread is not the greatest but I enjoy going there for the crab. Swai fish hmm I would not get. The Salmon was overcooked. Other than that It was not bad. The price includes AYCD beer, red or white wine. Can't go wrong with that.

Not a big fan of eating buffet over the course of two days, but this time I joined my friends on a food kama adventure!! I ate total of 6 buffets over the 2 days stayed at Mandalay Bay. I know it's crazy and how in the world I still can love buffet?!!   But I have to compliment on the excellent savory taste of the french onion soup!! So delicious that inspire me to cook some this weekend.   Next comes to piles of Alaskan King Crabs, you can eat it hot or cold. But I prefer hot dipped with garlic butter sauce. Between my friends and I, we ate more than 4 plates full of crab meats every dinner. We really got our money worth.   Also, I have to compliment their excellent taste of prime ribs! So tender and soft melts right in to your mouth. You don't even need to have teeth to chew on the meat cause it is so soft and juicy.   I was pretty selective on what to eat at the buffet. The other stuff like pizza, baked fish, pasta were not on my list to dine. I heard they were so-so... but if you are a meat and seafood eater. I would recommend eating here.   Dessert were excellent too. I like the lemon meringue pie and coconut macaroons!!",

    "text": "VERY disappointed! I don't usually do reviews, but I wish someone warned me. Almost ALL of their food tasted the same (also generic, overcooked, stale, canned, eckk), variety was extremely limited for the price & getting the attention from a waiter was a challenge. We dined at several hotel buffets during our various visits to Vegas and this particular one is still our least desired! We thought that we would give them another chance last weekend but what a shame. They really need a total revamp at this spot. It is such a nice hotel but whoever is in charge of this restaurant needs to get a grip - this was by far the most disappointing, tastless & awful food we had on our entire trip. The only reason I have this a single star was because our overburdened waiter (who had to cover 8 tables by himself) really tried & was friendly. Do NOT waste your time or money here - we deserve more than a refund!",

    "text": "I'm so sad to be giving a 2 star for Bayside Buffet, a longtime favorite of mine. We stay at Delano about 3-4 times a year and always eat at Bayside Buffet. The last 2 times (one being last week), my husband and I both agreed that the quality has slowly gone downhill. Food quality and freshness has declined. Prime Rib used to be my absolute favorite and single reason to come to the buffet. This last visit it tasted \"different\".  And not a good different. My husband passed on the crab legs as they were so small this go around. Said it wasn't worth his time. His sushi looked anything but fresh. The buffet wasn't busy and hasn't been for some time so I'm guessing this is why the food isn't fresh anymore. Very disappointing. Last vacation they had substituted some steamship roast for their prime rib. Whatever that is, it wasn't good. However, if you're really set on trying the buffet, get your discounts at the Vegas discount booths along the strip.  We now pass on the buffet and go to Citizens which is near the buffet. Solid food. Although the service is less than desirable.",

After his first presentation of Coffee and juices it was like partying the red sea to get hot coffee, more juice or waters for the table.  He also insisted on $5.40 UP FRONT when ordering a bloody Mary? House policy I don't know but man that is pretty lame. What are we going to do stiff him on a drink?     On to the food everything you can want in a buffet and more from a option stand point.  Brunch Sunday had shrimp, king crab legs, various fish etc on one table.   Second leg was typical eggs, sides, waffles, French toast and a host of various potatoes.  Fresh made omelet station was 1 guy and took forever to get your eggs.  Carving station with fresh Ham, Prime Rib & Turkey was best of the lot.  Hot station with various chicken, so-so bucco, and then Chinese options.  Cereal and fruit station was good and fresh followed by large desert tray bar that was well bland.   All and all the food was bland and not very innovative and we never did get or were offered any Champagne which was part of the brunch.  The server sucked, the food bland and the carpet was warn and dated. Time for an upgrade to this place.  A generous two stars.",

Although the website listed the price at $18.99, we were charged $30.99 upon arrival, apparently because it was the \"holiday season.\" (Note: this was Thursday, December 28th.) The food selection was minimal and the quality was mediocre at best. We wanted to give our son cereal, but we couldn't find any milk or yogurt to go with it. There were only a few kinds of fresh fruit and those we sampled were hard and tasteless. Potato options were also limited and cheese was of the discount variety. My advice would be to skip this dining experience, especially during the mark-up period.",

The pasta chef was super kind, maintained a good conversation and taught me a little bit about the pasta sauce he was making which I thought was cool!   They have many food stations, from seafood to pasta to Asian, so I thought their menu covered a pretty good-sized range. The custom-order pasta station was the probably best part.   While there wasn't anything in particular that was super phenomenal, the good food and atmosphere makes it a place I could come back to in the future.",

Realizing we hadn't been back in a long time saw a Travelzoo deal so took advantage for Saturday night dinner August 27 $49 plus tax for 2, a savings of about $17 or so. A good deal but I understand if you have the M Card (which we do) can still save $5 per person. Venue is still beautiful and recommend especially if you use a deal. Cashiers are efficient with the vouchers, wait staff largely attentive: especially enjoyed the peeled shrimp, rare delicious prime rib, fried butterfly shrimp.  Not enjoy so much the very small crab legs & claws which are still good taste but take an incredible amount of work to get the sweet meat out, lack of a pre made Caesar salad in the salad bar, Also when ask our waiter for a tool to crack the crab and some more napkins he went to a not yet totally cleared table and brought us the used cracker which we did not use.",

    "text": "Overall: Come here for the crab legs, salad, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, the corn on the cob, free champagne and the tiramisu! Other than that, this buffet isn't anything special compared to the other ones. Wish they had better dessert selection (the ice cream are those machines from Souplantation, although they do have waffle cones).   Compared to the other buffets, I feel like Bayside is on the lower end of the wow spectrum. I've eaten at Rio's buffet, Paris and the Spice Market, and I feel like all three of those were better than Bayside. The only reason we came here was because Mandalay Bay offered us $75 for us to spend on any of their dining facilities.  So for about $50 for four people, it was a pretty decent meal.   The price may be cheaper on regular days, but Vegas is really spicing things up and taking advantage of the Christmas season. No longer are the buffets only expensive on Christmas DAY, but they've taken the whole Christmas week and jacked up the prices by about $10 to $20 dollars! Because of this, there weren't that many people the night we ate here. Granted we arrived at around 5:30 for dinner, but we were seated fairly quickly.   They have different dining areas, but my mom wanted a table of its own rather than sitting at a booth connected to two other tables. We got a very nice table close to the salad bar with a very nice elderly waiter. Throughout the night I felt very sorry for just giving him all my plates of uneaten food or food I just wanted to try because he had so much to do and so many other people to serve.   Anyway, there's the salad bar (with lots of different toppings - turkey, corn, mushroom, etc and a plethora of dressing), the Italian station, sushi/breakfast/shrimp cocktail, Asian food, an Italian pasta station, a prime rib/turkey/chicken station, crab legs, dessert and a champagne/beer bar section.   The champagne and beer are included in the fee you pay. I was so excited going up and asking for a champagne, and they didn't even card me! Anyway, the food selection is pretty good but the food itself isn't so great. The ribs were icky and cold, the prime rib tasted fake (just like at the Victorian Cafe!) and the pasta wasn't too tasty either.   The best things there were the shrimp cocktail, the salad, the fried shrimp, and the hot crab legs (make sure you get big ones as people tend to take those right away), the hot corn on the cob and the tiramisu! Loveeddd the tiramisu out of all the other desserts. I think I ate four or five of those in the little small cups. Left a tip for the waiter and left on a slightly happy (because of the tiramisu) slightly disappointed mood.",

It was a Friday night... tired and desperate for food - this was our last resort.  It was 8:30ish so the crowd was gone. Or maybe it was just a bad buffet?   We got seated right away... server asked for our drinks... and we went to town. Mind you, the last time I had buffet was at a cruise ship and it was weird being in a buffet setting that looked so much like a cruise ship (did that make sense?)  Anyway, I guess I wasn't in my buffet zone b/c I hardly ate anything. I had two pieces of braised beef (which was decent... tender and right flavoring), string beans with mushrooms and steamed rice (it was hard so that was eh...)  I walked around waiting for food items to scream at me... \"pick me pick me\" but failed. I did go to the dessert bar and even that was eh. It was good, but not WOW.   Overall, I guess once you've had the best of buffets from the Bellagio and Wynn... there's no going back.  Go here if your desperate liked us... but if you have time, energy and money to go to the Bellagio and Wynn... really... go there.  PS: service was prompt and friendly... no complaints there.",

Buffet have gotten too inflated in price and the quality is not on par with the price.",

The food isnt bad, the service is fine.... but the hotel and resort in general get you in the mindset of expecting that high end experience, and the buffet just doesn't deliver. I think we can expect to see this buffet be one of the next to undergo a major remodel and upgrade...if they don't...I don't see them keeping those tables full.",

We paid full price so if there's anything nice about that buffet we didn't see it (I don't care that we got there later in the evening).  Wilted brown cooked vegetables? Check. Prime Rib that looked grey and fatty? Check Non-attentive waiter? Check Asked for no ice in diet coke, got ice (See above)? Check Unattended serving stations? Check Both wife and i got sick that evening and the following morning (we don't drink)? Check Flavorless, minimal desert section? Check Dark light, musty smells and 'oonch oohch' music suitable for a strip club? Check.  Were there any highlights? Yes, the stripper who walked by our table had highlights. Pink I think.  DO NOT GO. We ended up going out of necessity because we got out of the Aquarium and we were hungry. We have been going to the Feast Buffet (off Strip) at the Red Rock Casino - it's 1/2 the price but incredibly fresh and friendly. Go. Life is too short for overpriced, sweaty and grey buffet food.",

No, it's definitely not a celebrity chef type of restaurant, but I couldn't care less. Everything is fresh and tasty. Not to mention, the service was excellent!  I had the pleasure of eating at the Bayside Buffet three times (yes... breakfast, lunch, AND dinner), so I'll share each respective experience.  Breakfast Didn't think much of breakfast at Bayside because I'm not the most breakfasty person... but I ended up surprising myself. We sat down next to a bay window with a shimmering view of the pool. I quickly got up to get some food... and was pleasantly surprised to find smoked salmon and the works! I was more than delighted. They also had eggs benedict, which was superb, two different types of scrambled eggs, a crepe maker, a fruit bar... and so much more. I was in breakfast heaven.  Lunch I thought breakfast was good.... lunch was amazing! They had everything from sushi to soup to on-the-spot prime rib cutting! I can't even remember everything about lunch at the Bayside Buffet because there was so much to choose from!  Dinner Dinner let me down a little bit. To be honest, everything about dinner was the same as lunch except that dinner had two choices of Indian curry and... crab legs, which were delicious! Don't get me wrong... dinner was still great!  Bayside Buffet is THE place to get food for a reasonable price, especially if you eat your face off!",

The crab legs are good, but they are not normally fresh and the shells are soft which makes them really hard to open to get that one piece of meat.  I remembered their dessert used to be better also, though their bread pudding is still very delicious and about the only dessert I eat there now.",

There was no line, we swiped our cards to pay ahead of time and we were seated promptly.  It was during the week, so maybe that's why it wasn't super crowded.   You could even tip ahead of time. That always makes me nervous - will we get good service? The waitress came right out and took our drink orders. She was constantly picking up plates and filling up our drinks so that worked out great.  The food selection was varied and good. As with any buffet, nothing was amazing, but they had several fish alternatives, sushi that was made periodically throughout the day, prime rib that was cooked medium rare, salad bar, Mexican, Chinese, vegetables and a dessert bar. Plus tons more. In fact, I filled up my plate once and then saw a completely different section afterwards.  I'd definitely go back if I was in town again. It's a convenient, efficient, relatively inexpensive (for Mandalay Bay area) meal.",

Iced tea is NOT brewed (a big \"no no\" in my restaurant evaluation criteria).  Compromise on dessert quality if you need to cut corners but make sure you fresh brew the iced tea.    The best item on the day I visited was the prime rib.  It was tender, had nice flavor and was not bloody so you know they roasted it a while.  The food selection is not as vast as Bellagio, Wynn or M Resort but the price is commensurate with the selection.    The service was good even after the server shift change.    There are ATM style kiosks at the beginning of the line to automate payments.  The user interface was simple.    Bayside is A-Ok 3 stars.",

The only upside was that we actually didn't have to pay because we had a $50 food credit but had I had to pay for this....I would have been pissed.  I guess most people enjoyed the unlimited beer, wine and champagne....but for someone that doesn't drink much it's not that amazing. Plus you can drink in the casino all day and night. It's cheap wines anyways so couldn't they have a better selection besides just chardonnay and it was either merlot or pinot.   Seriously for the sushi section....I definitely expected a lot better....Salmon is so cheap and they didn't even have that....they had dried up tuna and imitation crab looking thing....  I think I liked their mashed potatoes the best....and that just doesn't say much for a buffet at such a gorgeous and pricey hotel....  I don't think they get a lot of business and that's probably why most of their food was dried out...We should have just gone somewhere else....but we wanted something quick and casual.  The worst part was the desserts....what is that whole section of garbage!? The frozen yogurt or soft serve ice cream....what ever the hell that was....it was the nastiest thing I've ever had.....Old Country Buffet can even do better.....  At least the service was decent. The bartender had the best service lol",

    "text": "Totally unhappy with our dinner here. First of all, we spoke to the lady at the front counter who referred us to the machines where you can self purchase your dinner tickets and pay. She said to select the number of people eating and beverage service. She didn't specify anything else, so on to the self-service atm-style machine we went. We purchased two adults, one child and one drink. The drink option didn't specify soft drinks or what. There was some mention somewhere we saw about alcohol but we don't drink. I thought $8 for soda seemed absolutely absurd when you are already buying a $33 buffet, so that's why we only purchase one. We are asked to walk all the way to the far back of the dining area to meet our waiter and be seated but there was a lot of confusion about where we were supposed to go and who was supposed to help us. That took about 10 minutes and was very annoying. You would think they would know how to seat people by now. We sit down, order waters and me, with the wrist band, asks for a root beer. We go to get our food and immediately notice many entrees and side dishes aren't fresh or replenished. I make a salad, wait a good 15 minutes and return to the slice meet and butter-drenched veggies just to see those are STILL not filled up. I am not paying $33 for three pieces of dried up dark meet that look like they have been sitting there for the last hour. Very disappointing. I inquire and I am told they are backed up about 20 minutes if I want to order meet. Ummm...it's 8pm and the place is less than 1/8 filled and nothing is being prepared fresh but I still have to wait 20 more minutes to get a darn piece of meet? Terrible service and VERY inefficient. I settle for some other selections, all of which were mediocre, at best. Fruit wasn't ripe AT ALL. I realize it's seasonal, but then don't include it on the buffet if it's just that bad. At that point, towards the end of our meal, I notice the only couple seated within eye shot of us is drinking OJ and they are NOT wearing wrist bands. Hmmm...I call the little Asian waitress over and tell her about the drink debacle and she just giggles and offers to get my husband and son a soft drink. What about a manager to refund me for this stupid wrist band I purchased unknowingly when I DON'T DRINK!!! Poor service once again. I decide dessert may the only redeeming factor left so we head to the dessert bar with high hopes. We get there and to our dismay NOTHING IS FRESH. Just like the stinkin' food. Everything looked like it had been sitting there for hours. Counters were messy. Cookies were as hard as a rock. I took one of each just to see and we literally sat at the table slamming them against the tabletop without so much as a crumb cracking off. Bread pudding was completely empty and no one was working the counter. We wait a good 20 minutes enjoying our $8 root beer and my husband pays the dessert bar a visit just to find everything the same as it was when I went. So no dessert. So let's recap: no alcohol, no soft drinks until the end of our meal when WE HAVE TO ASK THE WAITRESS ABOUT THEM BEING INCLUDED IN THE EXPENSIVE PRICE TAG, no meet, no veggies, no fresh fruit and no fresh desserts...and $113 plus tip!!! Can you imagine? Most expensive meal we have NEVER eaten...because we left there hungry and disgusted. PS: on the way out I tried to stop by the front and talk to a manager but everything was closed off so that explains why nothing was being prepared fresh. They were closing! Total epic fail and VERY UNHAPPY WITH MB.",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised at this buffet! We got the all-day deal for about $38 drinks except liquor included. All the MGM places have that good deal while Harrah's has the all 24 all u can eat thing. But considering we were staying at Luxor, far from everything, and that the reviews were bad for that buffet, we didn't mind the walk and the extra $8 for Mandalay.  Breakfast: To our suprise, we came here the week before Miss Universe and all the contestants were eating breakfast. All the guys in our group were happy. Selection was good. It was def a brunch as well. Fresh fruits, antipasto, and all those cold selections. Crusted salmon was good. Basics like sausage, pancakes, eggs were there along with flavored crepes and pancakes. Cottage cheese crepes were good. They was also a italian and carving station. Overall, pretty satified.   Lunch: Miss Universe contestants were there again. Happy campers to all. Food was good. Pretty standard buffet fair for lunch but it was good. They have sushi, not spectacular but if you need a decent sushi fix.. it'll do.  Now for Dinner: PRIME RIB is a must. And everyone in our party agrees, it is def worth it for the prime rib alone. No miss universe here tho. haha. The salmon was there again. So i was happy along with the usual basics. Italian, chinese, and mexican buffet items. For ME though, the dessert section on the right side was so worth it. Many cakes, tarts, cookies, and cobblers to give you a sugar rush. Also cute sugar free items that tasted pretty good.   Overall, you def get your money's worth. I don't know if it's b/c miss universe was there but I would go back to mandalay bay again.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  Me and the lady are having a staycation here.  We wanted to sample the breakfast buffet already knowing of the low reviews. How can you mess up breakfast?  They have to do something about the lines and the set up.  They have kiosks by the registers where people jump out of line and pay there then go wait to be seated. There are people that are waiting patiently in line for their turn. This is very confusing and irritating for customers waiting in line. All this does is aggitate the customer before going into the buffet where they get to find another irritating treat. The way they set up the place is you get in line and start at one side of the buffet. It's not set up to where there are sections of food for the customer. If you jump into the middle of the line to get some food, it will look like you're cutting in line. So if you want some more eggs or bacon, you have to wait in line to get to it? There were people cutting in line to get to stuff, but you can see people giving the stink eye or rude remarks. Something has to be done with this set up.  Now with that out of the way...    Earlier I asked myself, \"How can you mess up breakfast?\"  Reading the low reviews about this place, we chanced 'em.  Being a breakfast SuperFreak, I wanted to sample the bacon 'n eggs. The bacon was up to par and the scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy. Amongst other things that were sampled were french toast, eggs benedict, and blueberry pancakes. \"I'll Take It!!!\" So far so good...   Then my eyes gander at this serving of Ossobuco just chilling in front of me. (Ossobuco or osso buco is Italian for \"bone with a hole\" (osso bone, buco hole), a reference to the marrow hole at the center of the cross-cut veal shank. -Wikipedia) I'm all over it. I find some rice to go with the veal and marrow. Very surprised that this dish was at a breakfast buffet. EYE LIKA!!!   Another nice selection that made up for the set up was the flank steak. What is this doing here?!? It was cooked at a nice medium rare.  I stuffed my face with it.  I very much enjoyed the food at breakfast here. The last two said items were the winners in my eating experience. I want to give this place a higher rating, but the set up is really holding me back. I'd probably come back here during our next staycation. Try the breakfast buffet yallz.",

    "text": "We at here twice during our week-long stay; once for brunch and once for dinner.  Brunch - The brunch was pretty standard. Bacon, eggs, omelet station, waffles, pancakes, french toast, the usual suspects. It was pretty standard and nothing to write home about. I think they could consider two omelet stations though, the line gets pretty long and I didn't want to wait.   Dinner - I felt this left a lot to be desired. The highlights include their version of cioppino, which had three different kinds of shrimp and imitation crab meat. The tomato broth was amazing. They also had snow crab legs, which if you take the time to add some of that to the cioppino, brings it up a level (but makes it colder). The low-lights were the prime rib, which was brown and way over done. The flank steak was tough and not flavorful. The pasta station didn't make any sense and didn't tell you what the options were. All of the bread/rolls were hard. Even the desserts were just ok. Their tiramisu was made it cute little chocolate cups but the lady fingers were soaked and soggy from the coffee at the bottom.   Worth it for breakfast/brunch but for the dinner price, go to Planet Hollywood! It was the best!",

Only other buffet I'd give a thumbs up would be the Bellagio, but that's for special occasions when I visit.  I tend to judge buffets by how my stomach feels afterwards (I'm sure everyone does too.....) and the Mandalay Bay Bayside Buffet never gave my body a reason to rebel because all the food and ingredients were fresh and overall cleanliness was excellent!   Only thing that disrupted a nice buffet dinner was a well dressed family that snuck in and hijacked a vacant table, while pretending the dirty dishes were theirs, but luckily the server remembered who left and had security escort the free loaders away.....   Thanks to the Mandalay Bay for providing hungry travelers and gamblers with one of the best buffets on the Strip!",

The steak was decent, but was really only good when drenched with the au jus.  Other meat items were dry and if you have a dairy allergy good luck finding a starch; the only one I could find was white rice.  The service was decent and by that i mean dirty plates were picked up in a timely manner and refills were fast on drinks.  I'd probably skip this one when considering a buffet in Vegas.  But from what I'm told if you like seafood this is the buffet to be, but i don't see it.",

It was cool with me since it's just down stairs for us.    The place is a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  I paid $25 for brunch.  The staff was pretty cool.  Our waiter checked up on us regularly.  There were not a huge selection of food due to the size of this place.  The food was good to me for a buffet.  I was not expecting it to be the best buffet ever.  The best food to me was the prime rib, ham, and the made to order omelette.  A decent selection of desserts and also were pretty good.  I didn't try the crab legs because it was too early in the morning for me.  List of stuff I ate at the buffet - Prime rib, ham, chow mein, pork pot stickers, breakfast egg rolls, omelette, new york steak, fried chicken, scrambled eggs, watermelon, cantaloupe, garlic red potatoes, strawberries, small salad, fried rice, double chocolate cake, vanilla strawberry cake, vanilla frozen yogurt, butterfly fried shrimp, mashed potatoes, coke, OJ, water, and probably a few other items I have missed.  Yah, I am an oinker, don't hate =)  One last thing, this place serves all you can drink champagne for brunch.  Good for those folks that need a bit of a picker upper in the morning.    Overall it was a positive experience for me.  The food was OK good.  You get your moneys worth at this place.  Bon Apettit!",

    "text": "Would be nice if the hotel had separate line for guests staying at the hotel. Even nicer if workers came out and asked if people were purchasing all day pass, regular tickets or hotel guests...  Tried it twice here. Brunch and Dinner. For breakfast I liked the lox and fruits. Other than that everything was a typical breakfast buffet (pancakes, eggs, bacon....plus long lines. When they changed it to lunch menu, which was behind their schedule, they had a vege station and on the other side meat, poultry, soups, salads etc. It was limited selection. We got to sit towards the back \"wooden glass room\" where sunlight was good and view of a pool was available.   Dinner looked the same as brunch menu with the exception of crabs: snow crab legs or pre-cut crab legs. Along with the salmon I tasted I only had the crabs to eat. This time we were seated in the room towards the entrance. I noticed after awhile that this room had the loud crying kids, asians and latino's. If another party left and was seated it was the same race as the previous... and the help here were busy like crazy Just 2 ladies for the whole room. They served and bussed the tables, unlike the nicer rooms.  As for satisfying your sweet tooth. If you don't like dark Chocolate, good luck. 90% of their desserts contain dark chocolate + one dry looking carrot cake. So I just left with some vanilla chocolate ice cream from the machine in a waffle cone.  After comparing where we were seated I can say that the people towards the front of the entrance have more work than the people towards the glass window area towards the back. The atmosphere changes as well from a Denny's room to a Tommy Bahamas room as you walk further towards the glass rooms. With that I guess if you know how they try to distinguish guests.  We have enjoyed other buffets than this place. They can do way better for the price that you pay to stay here.",

Spending almost $30 a person kinda offends me if you're trying to be a high end buffet, while cutting costs.. The crab meat I had was over cooked and incredibly salty, the game hens they served were wrapped in an inedible paper, which soaked the juices (seriously... Use foil or plastic wrap...) - the stuffing was bad... Dry and gross... Roasted Chicken was over cooked.  I refused the Prime Rib, noticing how dry it looked...  Just not a good experience... I suppose it'd be OK if you were on a budget, but, I just don't understand going to Vegas on a Budget... Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas - Including your money - this place is a prime example of why you're money doesn't leave this city.",

Decent carving station, asian foods, pasta cooking station, and salads.  I really liked the corn chowder here.  It was creamy and sweet-you could really taste the corn which I really enjoyed.  I mainly had a lot of veggies here bc I was overdosing on meat the entire weekend.  I liked the bak choy in the asian station, and the green beans & tomatoes were a nice side with my breaded chicken & cheese dish.  What I liked was the pasta cooking station.  I had bow tie pasta, with shrimp, onions, mushrooms, with a combination of their alfredo sauce & tomato sauce, topped off with fresh tomatoes.  This was actually pretty good and I couldve eaten the whole bowl had it not been one of the last things I went for.  Meat was OK.  Liked their rotisserie chicken & grilled steak.  Good buffet if you are staying at Mandalay.  Luckily after my meal I got to meet some beauty queens bc Miss Universe 2010 just ended.  Not a bad way to end the meal! Tangent..Sad about Miss Philippines tho hah.",

The Bay Side Buffet at Mandalay Bay is expensive and the choices are minimal...but at the very least, you don't have to wait in line long for seating.  I couldn't find a single thing I liked here, including the dessert bar, which is a rare thing for me.  Of course, half of it caters to seafood (that being the hotel's theme) and I don't eat fish, so it was probably a waste for me.  $20 for lunch is way too much for this place.

They are legit king crab legs.. you know, the huge, meaty ones with the sharp little things poking from the legs.   #1 Con - dessert station... I mean, at least at the Bellagio, no matter how full you may think you are, one look and you find the tiniest space in your stomach to force something down.   Other that, I love their eggs benedict and french toast. Their mac n cheese tasted like the cheese came from packs, their prime rib is alright, mashed potatoes are not as good as the Bellagio and Wynn.   So if I'm comparing it so much to the Bellagio, why did I give it the same number of stars??... Crab legs, people. It's worth it if you are like me, and 95% of your Vegas buffet meal consist of crablegs, 2% is butter, and the last 3% consist of whatever else you feel like fitting into your life.",

    "text": "Sorry, I'm going to go for a solid 2 stars for this one. I've been to more than my fair share of Vegas buffets, and this one is just not good. It's not so horrible that it deserves 1-star status, but just looking at the overall picture, there are just so many better choices in Vegas if devouring buffet food is your thang.  Let's start with the main category for review, the food. Very limited selection, no standout dishes, and very disappointing crab legs. They were all still partially frozen, and still tasted like chemicals with salt. Plus, they were just flat out wimpy. If you're going to provide crab legs, might as well skimp on everything else and go for broke on the crab legs. People will no doubt remember that the most and return for that alone. Count me in as part of that group.  Just about the only decent things to eat, in my humble opinion, were the prime rib and the fried shrimp. The prime rib was actually pretty tender, juicy, and had a good amount of flavor. The fried shrimp was a hit, as there was a huge line just to grab those suckers. I guess it's not too hard to properly fry seafood, but when done right, people will gobble it all up like there's no tomorrow.  The buffet layout was small, cramped, and not good at all. If Mandalay Bay is serious, they should just tear it down and start from scratch with a new and improved version. Other hotels have done just that, with sucess. Overall, this is Vegas and there are better choices. But if you're stuck in the hotel and you're desperate for the buffet experience, then by all means.",

    "text": "The worst buffet we have ever experienced in Las Vegas.  prime Rib was tough as leather and had no taste.  The crab legs were terrible, could not even get them out of the shell and they were a strange color and did not taste good at all.  The selection of other items was limited and average at best.  Even the desert bar was poor.  Ice milk instead of ice cream and bland and flavorless cakes and pies.  Avoid if possible and go somewhere else.  Much better places close by or relatively close, worth traveling a little if necessary.",

The wait staff was on top of things and was on point with refreshing drinks.   I went for a late breakfast / early lunch so I got to sample a little of both. They had some flank steak out which was delicious and I have to mention the watermelon. Bayside had some of the juiciest most flavorful watermelon I've ever had. The only knock is the omelet line. Obviously a very popular station, so if you really want one you are going to have to wait.",

It was okay as far as food variety, and it all tasted fine. I think we came here close to dinner time, and I thought the cost was a little much. However, it included unlimited champagne so not a total bummer ;)  If I was near by, I may come here again. However, I've been to a couple of other buffets where I enjoyed the variety more and would most likely pick over this one.",

Based on our brunch buffet experience yesterday (10/26/13) if I were running the food service at Mandalay Bay, I would immediately terminate whomever is responsible for this \"restaurant.\" I don't expect amazing food at a buffet, but (especially for $26 p.p.) the food to be edible, tasty even. The only things that were edible out of the whole thing- the pastries and fresh fruit. How do you mess up eggs, waffles, and bacon? They did. I can t say enough bad things about this buffet. Horrible.  It was garbage. We left hungry because every single thing we tried was terrible. Not only the worst food I've ever had in Las egas, but some of the worst food I've ever had.",

With tip/Tax the buffet is about $17.50. The selection is fair---very Denny's like. Not much in the way of juices, coffee is average and only a few types of fruit. The egg station features a really unhappy dude, who rather bitch about his job to co-workers than focus on delivery.  Our table service was generally good, though the waitress to table ratio is real low.   One tip: They open at 7AM and if you get here early, it's much better as the place becomes a zoo.",

I'm being extra tough on them solely because of the \"sushi\". I can't believe how terrible the quality was. The rice was the shape and consistency of a Tootsie Roll - how did they even pack it that tight?!? I'm guessing it was machine made with some kind of high pressure extruding machine. The fish on top wasn't much better - it looked glazed and dried out, as if it spent the night in the cooler uncovered and all of the moisture was sucked out. The absolute worst item was the unagi. Freshwater eel is always cooked (in the case of unagi it is grilled). I'm not sure anyone informed the cooks of this buffet how this should be done. The unagi was tough and rubbery. I've never actually experienced this at any other restaurant and had to spit it out.   In summary, skip this place and spend your money in the food court.",

I wasn't a big fan of the sushi, but who the hell cares, BRING ON THE CRAB LEGS!!! we came back here the day after next, and  it was just as good. The service was great.

I'm sorry, if you are paying $20 for a buffet in Las Vegas and are expecting the ultimate dining experience, you are simply not being realistic. Is it the greatest buffet in vegas? Not by a long shot! Is it worth 20 bucks if you don't feel like leaving the hotel to eat? Yes.   They had a good variety of food that everyone should be able to find something  to eat there. It's pretty much what you would expect for general buffet fair- a little bit of everything from around the world. Everything is pretty good too. Actually I had some marinated skirt steak that was unusually yum. Check that one out. But yeah, sliced meats, italian, sushi, Asian, latin, etc.  The food itself was pretty good. About as good as you can expect for a buffet. People here seem to expect their buffet foods to taste like it was cooked to order. That's not how it works at a buffet. Reality check, you probably just don't like buffets. Leave the buffets to fatties like me, you're holding up the line anyway.  Bottom line. I paid 20 bucks to eat here. I got as much food as i wanted, several cups of coffee, dessert... it's a solid deal. 20 bucks barely would cover the coffee at the coffee shop or Starbucks in the hotel.   All that said, if you want to spend a lot of money on a killer buffet, check out Planet Hollywood. Have fun going there from Mandalay Bay, though.",

For starters, the shrimp cocktail here is pre-peeled. Many buffets have \"U-Peel\" shrimp, but here, you just pile it up and eat it, and it's good.  For your main course, there are crab legs. Unlimited crab legs! Plate after plate of them. They're steamed, whole--many other buffets only have them chilled and pre-halved, which isn't nearly as good.  Perhaps you'd like a tasty beverage to wash it down? Well, beer and wine are included, too. Not just some fixed amount per person, but as much as you want. FREE BEER, you guys.  At this point, everything else on offer starts to look like a waste of stomach space. Unlimited shrimp cocktail, crab legs, beer, and wine? Sign me up.  UPDATE: They've changed the pricing so it's cheaper now, but beer and wine aren't included any more. Naturally, they didn't reduce the dinner price by the price of the beer/wine package, so the combination is now more expensive. But the beer they had was only good if it was free, anyway. Now it's thirty bucks for all-you-can-eat crab legs and shrimp and prime rib if you want it.",

I haven't had this buffet in years, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that what I loved about them before -- the crab legs -- is as good as ever.  I'm sure other items were delicious, too, but I honestly can't remember. My friend and I were having a crazy huge craving for crab legs and had a less than satisfying crab legs experience the night before, so getting them here (so fresh!) AND finding plump, perfectly cooked shrimp cocktail, was pure gastronomical joy.  The service was excellent, too -- everyone smiley and happy -- even though we made a big mess. Yes, I can't believe I became one of 'those Asians' that had plates of crab legs in the middle of their table to share. I swore I would never do that till I was at least in the my eighties...but that's how good those legs were...  A must go again.  FYI: We also had the breakfast buffet here the next morning -- the food was fine, but the morning service was lacking.",

The wait is also not as long compared to a few years back (I visit LV almost every holiday).  I did notice that over the years, they brought in more \"fillers\" like pastas, rice, etc. but what buffet hasn't taken that route? The dessert selection is still pretty good but that might just be my sweet tooth talkin. :)",

After having to go to the mLife desk to have the comp loaded to my card, I headed over to the place around 1pm on a Friday.   There was plenty of food...no doubt about that. Nothing really stood out to me, though. I did enjoy the sushi but thought some of the meat was drier than it should've been.  Drink service was good though...the guy kept filling my glasses up faster than I could gulp them down.   All in all, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.",

For dinner, there's a nice salad bar, a turkey and beef carving station, a pasta station, Asian, Italian, and Mexican sections, some indifferent-looking random California rolls and variants, and a dessert area.  Service is okay, sometimes prompt, sometimes leaving glasses unfilled and plates lingering (despite the place being largely empty).  It's an average buffet, fine if you're staying at Mandalay Bay but nothing to go out of your way to try.",

There was a decent selection of food, including crab legs, smoked salmon, prime rib, Korean short ribs, cocktail shrimp, and other quality items. There was even a section serving Asian entrees such as chow mein, kailan, orange chicken, etc. I felt the crab legs, kailan, and a couple other items were too salty, but the rest were quite good. The dessert was very exquisite; there were several mousses and cakes.  Overall, it's a pretty good buffet, but doesn't offer too much over a buffet you can get for $15.",

    "text": "The Bay Side Buffet is deserving of extra stars for excellent food and absolutely no lines at lunch.  Most of all, Bay Side Buffet is awesome for having the biggest damn waffle cone I've seen at a buffet and for having vanilla FROZEN CUSTARD to fill that cone with!  That frozen custard alone is worth going to this buffet, though there are other great foods here.  I liked their make-your-own pasta bar, which is probably the make-your-own omelet bar for the breakfast buffet.  Nothing beats piping hot pasta with Alfreado sauce, chicken, mushrooms, and shrimp!  I also liked their Mexican foods section, which featured plain tamales, beef barbacoa, and pork carnitas.  The foods aren't amazingly good, like you might find at taquerias, but having some Mexican food is great when you've been eating nothing but creme brulees and prime rib for a few meals.  I still managed some prime rib here, which has good flavor and tends to be about medium rare, which is exactly how I like it.  The dessert bar, which has the great frozen custard, also has a good variety of sugar-free desserts.  Overall, a very pleasant buffet to dine at.  The buffet is situated above the awesome Mandalay Bay swimming area, so if you get a table by the windows you can gaze down at the pools and at the palm trees swaying in the breeze.  It actually makes you feel like you're in a tropical resort!  I'm a little surprised at how few people were there, but I'm glad it was pretty empty, only because that meant no lines to get in and no fighting over crab legs and cocktail shrimp.",

The rooms are nice, the casino is clean and relatively smoke-free, and the restaurants are all good; or, at least that is what I used to think.  The Bayside Buffet does NOT stand up to the reputation of the Mandalay Bay experience.  For a group of twenty-one people, they required an eighteen percent gratuity to seat the party together.  However, we were not seated together.  They were going to seat us in one of the main rooms spread out over six tables.  Mind you, we arrived early enough that they only had maybe three other parties in the restaurant.  When we complained, they refused to even push some of the tables together; we pushed them together, to consolidate the group into four separate tables.  That was the best that we could manage.  The service was slow.  And, mind you, this was a buffet.  So, slow service was kind of puzzling.  All they had to do was provide us with drinks, at an almost empty buffet.   And the food, well I guess that's what we get for going so early.  It tasted like they served us yesterday's food.  A lot of it was hard and chewy, stale.  And avoid the weekend omlette cook, he could only manage two omlettes at a time, barely.  The Bayside Buffet service belongs at someplace like the Tropicana.",

We had mimosas, eggs and bacon, and plenty of crab legs!  I then continued to stuff myself with shrimp cocktail, a lilttle bit of prime rib, and other miscellaneous deliciousness!  It was $23.95 for Sunday brunch.  By the time I got to the dessert part of the meal I was stuffed.  I looked around anyway, but nothing really caught my eye.

I bet you can't eat 4 slices of prime rib  Younger brother : deal... yer gonna lose  OB:  fine... have at it..  So we all go get our food, and:  OB:  hmm that's a pretty thin slice(it was about half an inch thick) YB:  dude.. .whatever..  So he packs away the first slice....    round #2 comes up  Me: man... this is messed up...  he doesn't know this is a no-win situation for him does he.... he just doesn't get it.

OB: dude... wtf.. that's another small one(another half an inch thick slice)....  go tell the dude who you are, and get a real slice YB: fine... whatever... but this one counts OB: fine  so the slice #2 completes and he goes for #3  OB:  wow..  see... now that's what I'm talking about (slice comes back about an inch thick) YB: yeah...  no problem... I got it Me:  you sure?  how you feeling YB:  yeah dude... no problem Me: *chuckling* alright dude... whatever  so... after a while.. slice #3 goes down...  Me: dude... you know this is a no-win solution for you...  are you just dumb?  you are gonna eat short of 4 pieces, lose, and owe him $20, or yer gonna eat all 4, he'll give you $20, and you'll feel like shit for the rest of the night. YB: yeah.. whatever.. I got this one... OB:  oh yeah?  well don't come back with another one of those wimpy cuts... you better get a real cut YB: whatever... yer just getting scared  So he goes and gets his 4th cut.  by this time, the rest of us are pretty much eaten out, so we're just sitting and watching.  OB: yeah dude....  you eat that one and I'll gladly give you the $20. (he came back with antoher inch thick piece) YB: yeah.. this one is a a big one OB: heh... yup...  so he starts on through it... granted, a bit slower than the first 2, but he's kinda going through it...  the first quarter goes down.... the second quarter a little slower  Me:  dude... just stop.. any more and yer just hurting yourself. YB: nah... I think I still go it  2-3 bites more...  YB: ugh.... this isn't gonna happen OB: yeah?  you conceding? Me: dude.. I told ya...... YB: FUCK!!!  I thought I had it  heh... so he loses his bet.. .goes home... and has the shits all night...  THAT is comedy...  but ... guess what.. .  the next night... we went to Red Rocks Club and had the buffet... and guess what he had.....     The food here is pretty good... granted that it's buffet food, but it's still pretty good.  People hoard on the crab, which is kinda stupid.  I guess people really do view these things as binges of gluttony.  I kinda just view it as another meal with a great selection.  I'm done with the days of eating a ton, and then suffering through it for the rest of the night or, like in \"Go\" eating too much shrimp with iodine and suffering for the rest of the trip.  go.. enjoy it... don't overdue it and you'll have a better experience.",

I have been here mostly for breakfast and a few times for dinner but we agreed the breakfast seemed to have the most variety of food to offer.    The buffet has huge floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the spectacular pool area of the Mandalay Bay with swaying palm trees.  The decor is Tommy Bahama meets Vegas.  Slightly tacky (it is Vegas afterall) but with an air of tropical elegance.     If you are a buffet snob like like us this is a good one to try for breakfast.",

We paid about $27 for each person, a little pricey, but totally worth it. We ate fish, snow crab legs, warm and cold; shrimp cocktail; prime rib; make your own pasta; Mexican food; tons of different options. The only real way to make up for having spent that much was the amount of crab we ate. I definitely think everyone ate $30 worth of crab.   We had an awesome time with dinner and you have to do at least one buffet while in Vegas!",

For someone who doesn't typically enjoy buffets, I definitely ate my money's worth.   My only gripe was that there were no bathrooms in the restaurant, and you had to walk across the hall of the Mandaly Bay resort to get to one.",

The line wasnt bad and I liked the electronic payment kiosks.   I was unimpressed with the selection of food, but soldiered on nonetheless. I had pizza, flank steak, biscuits and gravy and chilaquiles. The pizza and flank steak were good, everything else was just, ehh.  This leads me to believe that the lunch and dinner selection may be better, but that is only an assumption. The service was okay, our waiter never came back to our table after bringing us our first round of drinks. As good as most Vegas buffets are, I expected more from the Mandalay Bay.",

The kids loved the breakfast items and the dessert bar, waffle cones were a big hit.  The down side, the service.  Our waiter came back once to refill drinks then was MIA. At some point another server started taking our plates but we ended up having to stack them on another table.  The kids loved it.

    "text": "Meh.  Went for a weekday dinner, and this buffet is just not worth $30. Yes, they have crab legs, but they were lukewarm and a little watery. Meat tasted ok, but the crab on its own couldn't save this meal.  Salad bar was short and pretty uninspiring - couple additions like artichoke hearts and baby corn, but all very obviously canned and prefab. The weirdest part was that the obligatory salad bar sneezeguard was so low and close to the food that it was almost impossible to reach the ingredients on the line! Crazy! Guy I was standing next to tried to get a piece of corn then just walked away disgusted and muttering swear words. Hysterical.  Chilled shrimp were mushy, watery, and cocktail sauce had a strange, bitter aftertaste.   Hot line was a total mishmash of stuff, none of which had much flavor or even looked appetizing. Tried a couple ribs which had a sickly sweet sauce, mashed potatoes tasted real but pretty boring. Gravy was actually good. Paella looked so mushed and overcooked in the pan I didn't even try it. Panko crusted salmon was mushy, lacking in flavor, and the panko was wet and not crispy.  I'm saying mushy way too much for this buffet to get anything but 2 stars.  I will say that our server was really sweet and nice and efficient - a good improvement on service upon arrival, when we had to wait to be seated and then the woman waves her hand behind her and says \"just walk over that way, Jose will find you.\" Um, ma'am, you just waived at a wall. Also, we weren't told about the wine and beer and because we were directed to the right when seated and approached the buffet from that direction and the booze cart is on the far left, we didn't know about it until we were leaving. The $30pp price tag (and mediocrity of the food) would've been much more palatable if we were, ahem, medicated.   So yeah. Won't be back. You can do better, Mandalay Bay, really.",

The fruit/veggies were so fresh. They had orange chicken, BBQ short ribs and sliced sirloin steak that was amazing! I alwas love their carrot cake and my partner is obsessed with their cookies.  Keep in mind they are cheaper by $6 for lunch m-f. Sat and Sunday's it becomes $25. M-f lunch is currently $19.",

    "text": "This buffet for me was just eh.  I came here for Christmas dinner and they had a different menu than normal.  In general, most of the things I ate were pretty overcooked.  The prime rib was dry as well as the turkey and other roasted meats.  The crab legs were okay if you got them fresh, but many of them were smaller and didn't really have much meat in it.  I saw the section of the buffet where you can customize pasta and they'll make it for you! I was super excited to try it, but unfortunately the pasta was bland and flavorless.  Salt made it slightly better.    The pan fried scallops looked great, but to my dismay, they were very overcooked and not tender at all.    Maybe I just came on the wrong day and most of their food happened to be overcooked.  Although I would expect the Christmas dinner to be of better quality.   The line to get in was pretty long as well and it seemed to be long most days that I walked by the buffet.   A couple good notes were that the service was decent and they have pineapple juice!",

But to be honest, we got a vip ticket for this buffet, so I'm not sure if I'd wait in line for hours just to eat here. It's good in selective quantities, but the buffet as the whole wasnt the best quality. It's worth a try though in Las Vegas since they do have wide selection of international foods and they do serve seafood too, which is hard to find.",

The selections were good. They have a large seafood variety if you are one who enjoys seafood. I have more of the breakfast-style food as well as the desserts. It wasn't horrible but definitely was not my favorite meal that I have had here in Vegas. I wish I could say it met all my expectations but definitely did not. It was enough to fill me but for $25.99 a person I will definitely not be coming back anytime soon. My family and I could've gone somewhere else for cheaper and received better food. The service is great here and the staff is very helpful and attentive. They are the reason for the 3-stars instead of 2. Won't be coming here again but it was alright! Price is not worth it!",

    "text": "Interior: pretty and clean. Not as pretty as the buffets like wynn but still ok. If you sit next to the windows, you get a nice view of the beach.  Exterior: inside of Mandalay Bay. Pretty nice.   Service: not the best at all. There was two people working at the cashier and there was two lines that combined as one once you get to the front. So who goes first then? Well, common sense wise, customers should take turns like the family in the left line goes first, then the right side, then the left side. When it was my family's turn though, the family next to us rushed in front of us and the people at our line were annoyed at how the other family did that. When we finally got to the cashier, the woman's attitude was not the best. Won't complain much since it was dinner service and she must have been tired but still...? A little smile or something would have been ok but all we got was an annoyed tone. Water was refilled often so that as good. The friendliest people here were the chefs.   Food: for the price, I would say it's not worth it. Places like wicked spoon or the buffet at wynn charges a high price for lots of food. This place charges a slightly cheaper price but for a less amount of food. Not much variety and the sushi are terrible. The salmon sushi had no crab meat. Only hard rice and a cucumber. The tuna was somehow almost dark purple instead of red. Other food were average. Limited amount of desserts too. I'm a huge dessert fan and I have to say, the desserts were not the best either.   Overall, Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel and the chef at the buffet made the experience nice. But the overall food quality and first impression at the cashier line didn't leave the best mark for me.",

I perused all of the tables before deciding what to get, but I was underwhelmed with the options and started trying all different foods, none of which I liked. The salad bar did not have very many options and did not have jalapenos, pepperoncinis, bacon bits, or many of the other toppings I usually like. The pizza bar literally only had pepperoni and it didn't even look good... honestly, how do you mess up pepperoni pizza?!? I tried the mashed potatoes and gravy, but the gravy was too salty for me to eat. Gave the mac and cheese a try, but it was not flavorful. Attempted the sushi, but it was tasted old and not fresh. Even the desserts, albeit pretty, tasted boring. When I left, I basically felt like I had gone to an expensive, but poor taste in Golden Corral. Don't waste your money.",

    "text": "If you are visiting Vegas and need to do a \"Vegas Buffet\" to complete your experience, don't put this one high on your list.  For starters the spread and quality of food does not justify a $32.99 price tag (add another $8 for unlimited beer/wine which used to come free not too long ago) and you are looking at a $45+ meal tax/tip which is comparable to the buffet at Red Rock (perhaps $14.99) or even Silverton (same $15 ballpark).  What went well:  -You can take the already peeled shrimp up to the pasta station and have them make scampi for you. -Service was efficient.  What was off:  -The dessert section was a huge miss. Low quality desserts made to look nice and the worst quality soft serve ice cream on the planet...that icey \"ice milk\" you would find at a $5.99 bad Chinese lunch buffet. -The crab legs were extremely dried out. There was zero water in the pan keeping them moist. Huge disappointment as this is my go to item to save a meal when a buffet doesn't have too much appeal elsewhere. -The prime rib was well done. My biggest pet peeve in life is well done meat.  -The lasagna had cheap unmelted mozzarella cheese on top and was 97% thick noodle 3% ricotta, tasteless sauce. Pretty bad.  If I took a family of 4 here and spent $160, I'd have kicked my own A$$. Spend a little extra and go to Bachannal at Caesar's for a True quality feast.",

We went for the lunch buffet at 11am. Half of the food was breakfast items and the other half was lunch. It think this is great for those who want breakfast foods, but doing it this way does cut down on variety. From the penne pasta, to the potatoes, sausage, and everything else it was all bland. I was glad we used MyVegas for two free buffets because it would not have been worth the cost.",

Years ago this was the best buffet on the strip.  Now, not so much.  The buffet itself is aging and desperately needs a makeover.    The food itself could compare to an average Home Town buffet or strip mall buffet.  Much of it tasted cheap, using cheap ingredients.  Some items were good, like the carved Turkey or the egg rolls, but everything left a lot to be desired.  Spend 20 more at the Aria, you will not be disappointed.",

Our server was attentive with drinks & clearing plates. But the buffet was the star!  I really have zero complaints about the food on the dinner buffet. If you know me, that's a bit unusual. Sometimes buffets *phone in* common dishes, but I didn't notice that here. Literally every single thing I tried was delicious. While I do love to be critical, my only *note* would be to include more vegetables &/or non-meat entrees. I only say this because I noticed my plate was nearly all meats. But, I'm a picky eater, so...   This was my only buffet experience during my most-recent Las Vegas trip, so I may be slightly biased. With that in mind, know that I'm not a buffet fan. Bayside Buffet was an excellent buffet dinner, and I actually *almost* regret missing the breakfast spread each morning, except that I enjoy sleeping.",

Long gone are the days of decadent buffets for low prices.  Vegas no longer needs to bring in the masses with a promise of a great meal for a low price. That's fine, then charge a little more and make the buffet half decent.  We were staying at the hotel, the beautiful 4.5 star property for a business/pleasure event. The dinner at the buffet was a part of it and I would say the most disappointing part of the entire event.   The food was uninspired, unattractive, and unappealing. The saving grace would have to be the prime rib and the good service we received.  The pasta station was ok.  The salad bar was so sad. Seafood was terrible. The hot foods were overly salty.    Someone needs to give this place a serious makeover. From the drab look in the dinning area to the food. Seriously dissatisfied.",

We arrived for dinner somewhat late according to their hours.. and so little did we know, we didn't have much time to waste.  We took our time to peruse the goods for food options. They had a wide selection from pizza, to seafood, to prime rib, to ham, to Chinese, to Mexican to Middle Eastern (Yes I am working from visual memory here) and a selection of salad options.... then we found it...  The bar, manned by my newest best friend (and it only took a few seconds) David.   At Mandalay Bay, you pay for dinner (we used one of the girlfriend's discount coupons from MLife's app, MyVegas and got bogo admission for dinner. So $33 dollars for two.. not that bad at all) but if you are not as wise to use something like the app, 60 dollars does feel like a lot for a buffet.  Anyways.. we came to discover.. you get what you pay for. My best friend David (and I can't stress enough how awesome this guy was) informed us it's an open bar for both beer and wine. Well the Canadian in my leaped for joy and I asked him for a beer or two.. and let him know he'd see me soon.   The food (probably aided by the liquid I was consuming) was some of the best stuff we had the whole trip. There were some low points. The Corn on the Cob was soggy and bland.. and the Alaskan Crab legs were impossible to get into (our fault for not looking for or seeking out a solution for this)  My best friend David was amazing to go around and ensure every table got their fill of the bar as he was closing down an hour before the actual buffet closed.   I did have 5 beers with dinner, and took a 6th for the road. Because when in Rome.. OPEN BAR",

    "text": "Last week, my co-workers and I were in Vegas for a conference and visited Mandalay Bay on Tuesday, May 17 to enjoy dinner and then go see the Michael Jackson One show.    Since many of the full serve restaurants at MB were at capacity, we went to Bayside Buffet.   I have to tell you, this was possibly the worst meal I've ever had in Vegas.  The smell inside the restaurant was putrid, a combination of dirty dishes and mildew.   It seemed to originate around the desserts, where it appears the dishwashing station was located, but permeated throughout the restaurant.  Right then, I wanted to leave and request a refund, but we were out of options since the show was starting in an hour.     The food selection and quality was on par with a low-end Hometown Buffet.  Most of the food looked like it was sitting out for a good while, and whenever I ventured to try something, it was bland or just tasted terrible.     The best thing there was the soft serve ice cream, which is sad to say.  But to be honest, I never got over the smell so even if the food was decent, I'm not sure I could've enjoyed it.   Normally, I would have shrugged it off but with a price point of over $120 (incl. tax and tip) for 3 of us, I feel like I was truly robbed of my money.  I would've preferred to blow it on Blackjack and gone hungry.   None of this is something I would have expected for a high end resort.  The staff was friendly but I can't imagine their heart was in it considering the quality.",

They had everything from meat, seafood, bagels, a dessert bar, quiche, pancakes, french toast strips, eggs, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns with corned beef, and unlimited beverages. You could even add on mimosas as well if you chose.  It's a beautiful dining area and Mandalay has such a nice summer resort theme.   If you are staying in Luxor or Excalibur I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this buffet!! It's great!",

I had previously read a lot of reviews talking about how great breakfast was here, so when I found myself at MB around dinner time thought I would pop in and check out the place. The price was $35 for dinner, which is average for a Vegas buffet. HOWEVER, this has to be one of the smallest buffets in town. Despite being disappointed in the size, I was hopeful what food they did have would be amazing..... WRONG. The only thing I really enjoyed was the salad, and I made that myself. The only saving grace for this place, the staff is super friendly and the dessert bar is pretty tasty. Definitely won't be returning. My suggestion, if you are looking for a good buffet take your money elsewhere on the strip.",

I tend to gravitate toward my favorites, so when I saw a beautiful prime rib and a huge pile of crab legs, I knew where I needed to go!  The prime rib was perfectly cooked and really well seasoned.  The crab legs tasted fresh.  Other than that, I only really ate dessert.  I took two cookies and two small pieces of cake.  The cakes were disappointing... Really dry.  The cookies were good though, and service was great.  I don't see what all the fuss is about over at the Wynn.  The prime rib was better here, the crab was the same, and the price is twice as much at the Wynn.  I would definitely come back, especially now that I know there are coupons out there!",

The last stay I completed with Mandalay Bay I received the two buffets and when we arrived there was nobody at the host station. Odd.. especially for a peak busy weekend night. I started at the pizza station where I found most of the pizza burnt with the lack of tomato sauce. Pepperoni pizza that had about 3 and a half pieces of pepperoni lol. The Italian station was just as bad and I think I was only impressed with the meatballs and kept it moving. The carving station usually is my favorite and even that was off. Meat looked so dry and just not even appealing to eat! The service was actually good and our waitress was very attentive with keeping the drinks filled. I believe that if they could only improve on the food quality that would help the foot traffic of this buffet. You have to ask yourself sometimes why are they offering the buffet for free with certain promotions on the room. It's a marketing strategy that obviously helps increase the number of people to visit and eat. But it's going to take more than just an offer to come eat comp'd for me.. I need the food to improve.",

The service was pretty good, refills came often, and plates cleared quickly.

    "text": "Not stellar, just meh. Quality has gone down in the past years. But then again, all of the buffets on the strip have gone down (economy?).  The buffet at Mandalay Bay is probably on the lower tier of buffets compared to the Wynn and Bellagio. They made a addition of having both snow and king crab legs, which is always a plus in my book. The snow crab was a pain to crack though, the shell was very soft. Then again, I'm not really adept at opening crab legs. The king crab legs lacked the sweetness and briney flavor of good king crab legs.  The rest of the dishes were all forgettable. They had a Mexican, Americanized Chinese, \"Spanish\", and some really poorly done American foods. Throwaway junk food basically. All the vegetables were cooked to death (mush and brown). They were sitting in the holding cambros for too long (trust, I work in food service and this always happens when they cook the vegetables too early and hold it in a hotbox for too long).  The filet and prime rib were decently cooked, not the best, but they weren't rubbery like some other places. The proteins lacked seasoning.  All and all, go to the Wynn or Bellagio buffet, which my opinion are way better than most of the buffets on the strip.   P.S. they really downsized their selection on deserts, the selection is meager compared to the full gelato bar and bakery of the Wynn buffet.",

    "text": "While my wife and I only had breakfast and brunch here, we did go twice, so I feel this review is representative of the kind of food and service you should expect.  The hostess service that works the line after payment takes longer than expected to get you to your table considering it is a buffet.  I guess there are still server sections, so maybe this makes sense.  I was glad to see a hot carafe of coffee already on the table as we sat down.  The server will then take your drink order for nearly any other juice or hot beverage.  The first thing I'll mention about the food selection is that the prime rib was surprisingly good, I mean really good.  There was a nice salty, herb crust on the outside which was quite satisfying.  The omelet station was very busy, but the cook was quickly working 5-6 omelets as once, while dealing out Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay anecdotes.  Nice touch and better than staring blankly at him while he cooks.  The cheese blintz were quite good and very addictive.  I'd recommend throwing some strawberry sauce on top.  If you are a carb-ovore, you will be pleased with an entire bakery selection on the opposite side of the dining area.  Overall, a nice breakfast, but nothing that will be memorable outside of this review.  It's relatively inexpensive at $17 for breakfast and $24 for brunch (in terms of Las Vegas anyhow.)  It is also convenient, especially if you are coming from THEhotel or the Mandalay Bay hotel rooms on your way to the convention center.",

This might be great if you have a tapeworm, but there isn't much on this buffet that is remotely edible.  Even worse, the confusing layout and slow moving lines will leave you annoyed and frustrated.  But the worst part about this restaurant is that there are no bathrooms inside.  You have to leave the restaurant and enter the casino to go into the bathroom.  I don't know why this is?  Perhaps they are afraid guests will go to the bathroom to purge in order to \"get their money's worth.\"  Regardless, in a restaurant where you spend more of your time wandering aimlessly and waiting in line to find out whether that hot plate is filled with crab legs or chicken fingers, you'd hope they'd at least have a convenient bathroom available.

The choices seem a bit limited compared to the above mentioned comparable buffets.  3. The lines for the made to order omelet station moved VERY slow. And, your choice of omelet fillings were very limited.  4. Even for a buffet service was poor.   Bottom line: If you are staying here it's convenient.

Seriously, 32 crab legs on one plate?  Are you eating all that because you're hungry or because you can?  Ok, stepping off my soapbox for a minute, the food at the Bay Side Buffet isn't bad.  The layout is a little weird though-think Kung Pao chicken next to French Toast, fried shrimp next to eggs benedict. And at $25 a person for champagne, all you can eat brunch on Sunday's it's a pretty good deal.  Maybe I'm just being a bit cranky because I wasn't wearing my stretchy pants and got full after two servings?",

There was never a wait during the times I went, however, I did go later for each meal, 10am for breakfast and 8pm for dinner.  The food was all very fresh, mainly because of the volume of people that travel through the place.  The price was very reasonable, $16 for breakfast and $27 for dinner.  The service was good, always keeping the drinks filled.  The omelette station ALWAYS had a line there.  I never got one because of it.  That was a downer, but the prime rib they had sitting out because of the lunch changeover satisfied me enough.",

Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary. Food is salty as hell. Ambience is ho-hum. Selection wasn't as impressive as other hotel buffets.  Bathroom is OUT of the main area....which means you have to walk out of the buffet area to the casino area to do your dirty work. Sheesh. Buffet w/ no toilet? What's up with that? When you come back you need to have your receipt stub with you, but in all honesty, no one checked, so technically you can just sneak in and start eating (in line, no doubt).  We paid around $35 for dinner. Go to the Bellagio buffet if you want better.",

    "text": "After eating at the Buffet at Wynn the previous night, Bayside Buffet cannot compare at all.  My family and I came here for a quick lunch which cost us about $20/person, which is relatively cheap.  Dinner is only $28!  Limited menu items, and only about 50% of the food actually tastes good.  I had about 3 plates, and had the waitress take away the plates with most of the food remaining on it (I know, it was such a waste, I felt really bad).  It just wasn't that good...  I mean the food is still edible, just I'm spoiled when it comes to good food!  The only plate that I actually finished was the fourth plate, which was made-to-order pasta, which was mediocre.  I also didn't like that the desert bar is all the way across the other side of the buffet.  Me being a fatass, I was too lazy to walk over to the other side, so I can't comment on the desert.  I remember back when they first opened and their food was really good.  It seems to me the buffet and overall quality of the hotel has degraded extremely in their standards over the past few years.  It's a good place to go if you're on a budget and not expecting much.  Otherwise, stick to the Wynn!",

Only one kind of sausage? Greasy bacon. Canned fruits. So-so waffles and pancakes. Was the scramble eggs made from real eggs? Eggs Benedict that weren't as good an egg mc muffin. The only thing that I really ask for of any breakfast buffet is shredded hash browns. It's not much to ask for, but the last couple of times I've had breakfast buffets in Vegas, they were nonexistent. That trend continued here. Diced potatoes and Jack-in-the-Box style hash browns. Boo!   The good. They served salmon. The omelets were good and popular. I liked the strawberry syrup for the waffles. Decent pastries and desserts. That's about all that stood out to me.  No beverage bar. I hate having to keep asking for refills and waiting for it.   EMTs were working on some dude who collapsed.   A dull end to a productive trip. I should have gone to Denny's.",

Their Chinese food was gross, like most buffets and their sushi looked old but their smoked salmon and roasted tomatoes were the freshest and most tasty I have ever had!

Lastly, after you sit down, the waiting staff is done with you. No coffee or water refills unless you hunt someone down. There are better buffets for the price and wait time.",

A bit of a line for the omelets, and I didn't want to wait, but my friends said they were good.  I had Eggs Benedict from the buffet... not good because none of it was hot or even warm.  It's my favorite dish and I should know better than to get it at a buffet.  I liked the pastries and the coffee was good.

    "text": "Had brunch here and wasn't really expecting much. But dude was I surprised! First of all, the waiter gave us free champagne with free refills which my dad and I quickly capitalized on. Getting buzzed with dad yields some fine quality father-son time indeed!  Onwards to brunch. The selection was pretty standard fare. Some pretty neat create-your-own pasta selections. Was very impressed with the squid pasta. Had a very potent taste and at the same time was very delicate and fresh like seafood should be. My dad single-handedly destroyed Mandalay Bay's supply of crab legs as that is his absolute favorite food.  I think the highlight of the visit had to be the MOUNTAIN OF BACON. Yes. In the breakfast area, there was a heaping pile of bacon sitting under a heat lamp. I kid you not. Never before in my life had I ever seen such an unquantifiable amount of bacon ever. I think my heart melted from the sight... and then had its arteries subsequently clogged because SO MUCH BACON MMMMM.  Also had a couple bagels, very cold and creamy cream cheese with that, and handfuls of smoked salmon. Awesome treats. I'd give this buffet 5 stars if it weren't for the desserts. Bloody hell, those desserts were outrageously bad. Had to spit a good majority of them out. Most of them failed to rise above supermarket freezer standards. It feels like such a wasted opportunity.  People always seem to complain about the heavy price that comes with these buffets because they always seem to forget that these places are all-you-can-eat! If you feel you're being cheated, just grab another plate! It's a buffet after all so eat your fill! If you're not hungry, then why are you even at the all-you-can-eat buffet!? Go eat your girly salad elsewhere! =P  Anyways, it's definitely not the best buffet in Vegas. Check out Bellagio or Wynn for that kind of fine dining and whatnot. But if you're in the area and you're unwilling to drive to the center of the Strip in that hectic traffic, Bayside Buffet's definitely worth a look! (at least for brunch)",

    "text": "Mandalay Bay's buffet introduces nothing new or spectacular. The reason I chose this buffet was because I was staying at the Mandalay Bay and it was cheap and convenient, plus I got to use my express comps to get a free meal. This is just your run-of-the-mill buffet that is on par with the Le Village Buffet at Paris and the Carnival Buffet at the Rio, only not as big in selection and price. For $25 you can get a brunch buffet on the weekends, and brunch is my favorite time for a buffet. You get free champaign and there are endless crab legs, shrimp cocktail, and prime rib. So by eating those 3 and drinking champaign, you more than get your money's worth, and you don't have to leave the buffet feeling overfed and gross. The desserts aren't nearly as fancy as the ones at the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, but those are in another class all by themselves.  There wasn't a line to get into the buffet, but there was a pretty big line at the customized omelette station and the breakfast station as well so try to either get there before 10am or after 12pm to avoid crowds. The buffet also has a great view of the pool- to make you feel even more like a fatass compared to the beautiful bodied sunbathers. Definitely not one of the best, but it is better than average, so check it out if you happen to be in the area.",

Idk if it's because it's lunch but there's not much seafood....   The dessert table was AMAZINGGGGG and there's froyo too with waffle cones :D  theres really big red juicy strawberries and there's a bunch of those sunflower seed/nuts/walnut/wholefood stuff too.   Sirloin was juicy and there's au jus and gravy to go with it.   very good meal. I mean there wasn't anything AMAZING but the food they did have all tasted good.

    "text": "I personally feel like with all the great restaurants in Vegas, buffets aren't that great.  I mean what do you expect? They're buffets... For the price it's great.  But for my last dinner in Vegas, I was just saddened by it.  I first headed over to the crab legs and prime rib since they're pretty much the most expensive things out there.  The crab legs were alright, but man, when they're lukewarm to cold, they just aren't as good.  Some of the meat stuck to the insides of the legs too.  The prime rib was chewy and again cold. Blah! At this point I keep trying to tell myself, \"it's a buffet, it's a buffet...\"  Got the pasta station next.  LOL, maybe this is insulting but it reminded me of the pasta station at some dining halls at UCSD. *flashback moment* okay, it's over. Yeah, it has some flavor, but haha the pasta was already par cooked so it kind of came out overcooked when they put it in the boiling water.  I tried to stay away from the asian section, but i mean got to give everything a try right? I don't know why I got fish. Fish = dry at buffets. I'm stupid, just don't get the fish. and YAY for coconut shrimp, can't screw that up!   I actually really did like the seafood cioppino.  I don't know what it's REALLY supposed to taste like, but I liked the flavor. Spicy and tomato-y and got lots of random seafood things in there.  Desserts...kind of sucked.  Cobbler had maybe 2/3 crumb topping and 1/3 canned fruit.  Cakes were meh. Frozen yogurt was like...ice-y vanilla paste? Cookies were soft, and not bad.  Honestly, I think they could do the desserts a little better.  Why am I being so picky for a buffet? I don't know, it's a buffet.  Come here if you want crab legs 'cause that's pretty much what I saw everyone else getting.  But I'm not going to buffets when I go to Vegas",

This place, I will bump it up to 4, as it was the only place we ate at AGAIN that we visited 4 months ago.   This is a solid buffet and a great deal for the price.  I liked it much better than the spice market and I believe that one would have cost us more before the discount we got.  I only did one plate of crab - but that's because I had a lot of company with and I was trying to eat politely.  Last time, I got down on about 3 plates full.  The cold shrimp and the fried shrimp were excellent.  Love their salad station with all the toppings and the pizza right next to it.  I think I might have liked the deserts at spice market a TINGE better, but the cheesecake and clafoutis I sampled was super yummy.  I think if I was going to take advantage of an \"pay once, eat all day\" it would be here.",

It might've been that I was hoping to catch the tail end of brunch, because after a fun night out breakfast sounded like the best idea ever, but all that was there was a interesting mix of indian, asian, and some american dishes. However, I still managed to eat the food, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The prime rib was pretty good, but it's pretty hard to go wrong with that.  If you can avoid this place, you should--there's a lot of other buffets in Vegas that are better.",

    "text": "I enjoyed a comp breakfast turned lunch at the Bayside buffet.  Thanks to myVegas rewards I got a lunch buffet...FREE. That's the only way I will eat a Vegas buffet. And it's been that way since back in the 70s when a breakfast buffet was $1.99 and a lunch was $2.99. The casino pit bosses handed out free buffet coupons like the strip \"card flippers\" do today. I got a breakfast buffet at a 18.99 value since I got there at 10:30 am. Lunch started at 11:00. Being 30 minutes I got to taste the breakfast fare. It's about the same as the Excalibur and Luxor I had earlier in the week. Plenty of breakfast items plus pizza and most Mexican items are out for the whole day. The Mexican Chilequillas a Mexican enchilada casserole was exceptional. At 11:00 am most of the breakfast dishes were replaced with lunch items. Fried chicken Italian sausage and peppers swedish meat balls and stuffed shells were all pretty good. The carving station made the buffet worth it. The bbq beef ribs were excellent. The deserts at the Bayside were about the same as the Luxor and Excalibur. I cant imagine the dinner buffet gets any better so unless it's an Mlife or myVegas rewards comp get the $18.99 breakfast and show up at 10:30 and roll into lunch at 11:00 and save 5 bucks.",

Neither the staff nor the customers appeared to have felt any joy in recent memory. The food itself was not great. I had an almost inedible slice of dried out brisket from the carving station. The sushi was just simple rolls, veggie and other cheap varieties. Typically at a buffet like this (which I promise I don't frequent regularly) I end up feeling a little disappointed that I get full before I get to try everything that looks delicious, or have seconds of the tastiest items. Here, I ran out of things I wanted to eat before I was full. Desserts were disappointing. There were lots of little cakes, dry and tasteless. There was a soft serve machine serving the kind of ice cream cone you can get for 69cents at a gas station. No way I'd choose this buffet again.",

    "text": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a fun getaway and ate here out of convenience on the day that we left. Well, that and the fact that we had a Free voucher to eat here compliments of MLife. We also had a B1G1 Free voucher from MyVegas and wanted to use it for our kids. (Well, because they're cheaper). However, under no disclosure, the kids price was not honored to use for the coupon.   Anyhow, if your kids are over the age of 4, they are $22 and change for the Friday champagne brunch. None of my kids drinks champagne nor do they eat more than $5 worth.   As for the food, I noticed some of the meats (ie. Flapmeat) was terribly dry and had burnt marks. Not char marks, burnt marks, there is a difference.  I'm only guessing but I would say this tasted like food from the night before.  There were also many other meats similar to that effect on our morning brunch.   Other selections included oatmeal, salad bar, breakfast food like waffles, bacon, poached eggs, omelet station, and even crab legs. .  Selection is very limited for Brunch here, I would probably come later in the morning hoping they would have more choices.   I would say for the GOOD, the cold food like Lox, Cheese, and Cold Cuts were excellent. The fresh blackberries/blueberries were fresh, though when it was out, they replaced it with Strawberries instead.  The kids got their milk in plastic disposable cups.  The champagne tasted quite good, though I just had 1/2 glass and had to drive after breakfast. The pastries like the croissant and some desserts (ie. bread pudding) were excellent as well.  I would say $30 for breakfast is a tad on the high side but unfortunately, we came on a Friday instead of a Thursday morning and that was the only choice available.   The service here we had was quite good and we did leave our server a deserving tip. (Unlike other reviewers experiences)  Since we stayed here, parking (the new fee)  was already included in our bill and thought we would make the most out of our stay and try here.",

The top sirloin was almost impossible to cut with the knife they give you.  The dessert section was generic pieces of cake and the vanilla ice cream was yellow.  There are no big ticket items here.  The sushi looked like the stuff you could get at a gas station and there wasn't much of it. Mostly generic California type rolls.  I only saw one type that had actual fish in it.   Overall selection was average, but nothing to write home about.  You're probably better off just going to a fast food place and save a few bucks.

Back in the late 90's when I use to go to the body building & fitness expos. in the Mandalay Bay hotel, hitting up the Bayside Buffet was automatic, as it was da spot for ono buffet grindages!  It's been many years since I last hit up this buffet spot..........I wanna say the last time I ate here was probably back in 2012, or 2013? Can't remember the exact year.  I was pretty happy to make a return visit to the Bayside Buffet..........upon looking over the buffet grub, not much has changed, as they still offer an array of buffet grub like - American, Asian, Mexican, & Italian fare. They also offer lots of different Seafood items too, if you're into that.   Of course if you have a sweet tooth like me, the desserts served here won't disappoint you, the only problem for me is that I can only eat so much desserts! Aiyah!  The Bayside Buffet area is pretty spacious & clean. Service here is outstanding, and the buffet price per person for dinner is pretty reasonable at $32.99.   The only bummer thing about coming here is that the restaurant doesn't  validate for parking, so depending on how long ya wanna strap on the feed bag..........after rolling yourself out of this buffet spot, keep in mind the parking meter is running, and you still gotta pay-o-la for the parking fees.  I'm hoping that one day the hotels in Las Vegas will loosen up the parking fees for guest that spend money here at the hotel, & restaurants.  Check 'em out gang! No can go wrong!",

Went there early, they open at 4:30.  Got a nice table, First round started with snow crab, hot and chilled, [the chilled is tastier] tried the buliabase with mussels and shrimp, skip this, mussels  shriveled.  Went back for more crab till I had my fill, got to the desserts, icecream cone was super crunchy, they had ice milk vanilla and chocolate, Decent selection of desserts but  hit my limit.  Baked salmon looked good but over cooked for my taste buds.  The meat selection looked good but I filled up on the snow crab and shrimp cocktail.",

We like the large selection and different variety of food available, particularly the Ox-tails and lamb shanks. Everything is cooked very well, spices are a bit reserved but I guess they have to appeal to a lot of different taste buds. Price is good for what you get and the service from the staff is exceptional even though it is a buffet and I know most people rarely tip the staff since they figure they are serving themselves (I always tip extra at a buffet). Overall I have always been pleased with our dining here and until that diminishes I will keep coming back, Aloha",

They do have a wide variety of food options, but nothing struck me as really good, just average.   I did enjoy a Seinfeld-esque moment with the omelet lady who continually got upset with patrons for not standing in the right place, or being ready when their omelet was done, she was flat out awnry, which was fun to watch.  I came her twice but only because my food was comped, not sure I'd pay face value for this experience unless I had not eaten all day and I wanted mass quantities of very average food.",

Waiter was attentive and kept empty plates cleared and glasses full. Overall for $22 per person there was a decent variety. Salad bar, bagel bar, pizza, fried chicken, turkey and mashed potatoes, taco bar, Asian potstickers and noodles. They opened a pasta station as we were finishing where you could customize it made to order. All food was warm. Not overly flavorful but what would you expect for $22. My wife tried a piece of shrimp which was slimey. They had a nice dessert selection with cookies, cakes, and soft serve ice cream machine. We were so hungry it worked for us but we will work hard not to eat there again unless the other restaurants in Vegas are for some reason closed.",

    "text": "For Dinner on a Saturday night last month, my husband thought it was be convenient for us to eat at Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay is located by StripSteak. We arrived around 6 pm, with only 1 party of people ahead of us in line.   We were seated at a booth and had our drink order taken and then free to get our food. For the price, Holiday Buffet Dinner Price $35.99 prior to tax, per adult ($77.92 after tax for 2 adults), also the same price as general dinner pricing. Unlimited alcohol (beer & wine) is $10.99 (prior to tax) if you want to add that to your meal, but only available during dinner service.  The overall rating for this Buffet is 3 stars, out of almost 1200 reviews. I can see why since the food here is just average. Just like any other buffet and Vegas buffets, there is numerous of selection here, with choices including American, seafood (shrimp, mussels, clams and salmon), Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Mexican and a touch of French and European food. But just didn't think a lot of the food that I had was most memorable and must have.   There is a make your own pasta station where you can tell the chef what type of pasta you would like and what sauce (choice of 2 sauces and 2 types of pasta) and also if you would like any added vegetables. That may appeal to those that are into those type of food options but the pasta was just average to me.   The dessert station (in the back of the restaurant, opposite of the other savory buffet choices mentioned above) was just average. Being that we came a few days before Christmas to dine here, there were some desserts decorated in holiday fashion. But again, there wasn't a whole lot that blew me away with their desserts. Some choices you can find here included mini pecan tarts, self serve ice cream with toppings (sprinkles, mini m&m's, chopped nuts, etc), brownies, popcorn, cake, cinnamon roll, rolled cake, bread pudding and cookies.   Our server was good for the most part at removing our dirty plates and bringing us hot water and refilling it when requested.   My husband and I were both full after eating at this buffet but we both felt that we have definitely had better.   Please note that there are no restrooms inside this buffet and so you will have just go out to the casino for the nearest restroom (not a far walk).",

So far, the bagels were stale and the carnitas was very dry and overcooked.  The very little fruit they had was acceptable.  The cream of wheat was pretty standard.   The salad spinach tasted like it was not washed and I do not believe the table water is filtered, or at least it doesn't taste like it is.  When I came back to the table with another plate of food, I found a little extra at my table I didn't order.  Very unfortunate.   I was looking for the positive in this place but came up empty handed.   Hopefully,  they can up their game at some point in the future.",

The food honestly sucked and so did the service. Not only were the front desk ppl were rude but the lady grabbing plates and getting our drinks were also rude. She would just walk away when we were trying to ask a question, even the table next to us were getting mad.   The food there was so limited and half ass made. The sushi was literally one platter and it was trash. The rice had a weird texture and was mushy. Sushi from Fred Meyers is better. The only thing I enjoyed were the crab legs. I would recommend finding another hotel to eat at or even a fast food place. NOT WORTH $37.",

No line and we literally just paid the lady and got in without any problems.   The server wasn't at the table just yet so we decided to get our food first. Now the hot foods all had heating lamps underneath them. Which made some of the thongs and things to pick up the food super hot. Overall it was just outdated of a style and the heating lamps were extremely hot.   I don't believe the food was worth $32.99 per person. It almost seems like I was eating at Sizzler or something like that. The soup was overly salty and it was boiled and over cooked.   Most of the cooked meats were also all dried out and weren't that appetizing. I'd say skip this buffet for sure.",

    "text": "Wow, this buffet was bad! I did not leave full. My advice would be that if you're looking to eat big, skip this buffet and just treat yo' self to two entrees from a good restaurant because it'll cost you the same.   The lady at the register was not very friendly. Didn't even say anything to me after running my card, just looked out in the distance behind me even though no one else was in line back there. I stared and smiled at her for a minute before realizing she was done with me.   The server and bus people were much nicer, however I gotta be honest. It's awkward when they all discuss how to serve you in a language you don't understand and then turn to you and say in English \"right this way\". I mean I'm sure they're not saying anything bad, but it feels unprofessional to discuss the customer's service in front of them in a language they do not speak. Especially when they can all speak English clearly. It's just uncomfortable.   All this would be water under the bridge if the food was good, but holy crap was it NOT!  I came for Sunday brunch, and it was $25.99. With tax and tip it's over $30 for this meal. I'm expecting some nice things, at least nicer than Golden Corral right...? Not at all. I wish this was as good as Golden Corral LOL!  This food was impressively flavorless. They had Velveta shells and cheese, and it was less flavorful than when you make a box at home. Alfredo bow tie pasta just didn't taste. Breakfast sausage had a whisper of sausage flavor.  The fried chicken seemed completely without spice.   The star of the show here though, and the reason I decided to write this review, was the \"orange chicken\".  Picture orange chicken in your head...  Now tell me, are you picturing McDonalds chicken nuggets with a drizzle of orange sauce on top?  Cause that's was it was here! I laughed out loud looking at it once the surprise had passed.  I had to try it, and I can confidently report that it was no good.   I would never come to this buffet again. The Seasons Buffet at the Silverton is cheaper, and the high quality of the food there blows my mind.  I could never justify dining at the Bayside Buffet again.",

It wasn't as great for the adults. The roast beef was kind of chewy. The crab legs were super tiny. My dad and I thought the sesame balls were the best thing we ate so that's kinda sad. I am a huge lover of desserts but found them all to be lackluster. There were little tarts almost like pecan pie but made with walnuts that was pretty good. I only ate one bite of the chocolate mousse cake. I had some sort of bite sized cheese cake in a shot glass but it tasted more like mousse. Luckily we had two for the price of one entry and my son was free. That was the only saving grace.",

I always regret not looking at Yelp first, but there is no way that a nice upscale hotel like this would have a bad buffet, right? WRONG!  The place was about 2/3 full, yet we waited for at least 15 min to be seated. The food selection was minimal, and you could tell that it wasn't turning regularly as many of the dishes looked over cooked, and old. As expected, taste was the same. Cold once out from under the heat lamp, soggy, or hard.   With such a small amount of choices, you would think that it would be easy to keep the name tags in front of the proper food, but most items had the wrong tags and many had none at all.  The short of it is don't eat here. Go to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay, or if you want a buffet, find a different one down the strip. Very strong chance any of them will be better.",

I think for an extra $5 you could get all you can drink mimosas.  Catch your server as soon as you sit down, they don't come around all too often so if you want something special to drink let them know ASAP.

I believe it came out to $23.95 per person.   This buffet didn't specialize or cater to one specific food (i.e. seafood buffet).  Unlike other standard mediocre buffets that try to have cuisines of the world to appeal to their diverse customer base, Bayside indeed has a little bit of everything.  But, done in a tasteful way (pun intended) unlike other buffets that try to offer too much leaving quality and taste fall flat.   Truly - a crowd pleaser for all the girls with different taste buds. *Want cereal, grits, cream of wheat at a buffet? Most people won't eat cereal, but it's a nice option to have. I love brunch and hotel breakfast foods, so that is a total plus for me. Their fruit is surprisingly fresh and chopped in glorious, huge chunks.  *Fresh Seafood for the seafood lovers.  *Plenty o' Meat for the meaties.  *Plus, Italian, Asian, Mediterranean. It really will cater to all.    Also, leave it to me to eat the food at buffets that most people will bypass to get to the good stuff, but I can report that the bread rolls here are Enji approved. The bulgar wheat cous cous (peep the pix) that comes in a small bowl that is placed next to the hummus and baba ghanoush section, which  was completely ignored by the masses. Tsk tsk tsk. I could've eaten a whole plate of that and gone home happy.   Desserts - solid.  Was a little bummed out that they didn't serve soft-serve or ice cream though.",

After noticing it & asking for it to be credited & being told they would they then charged the card AGAIN (we didn't even swipe the card a second time so their system apparently has the capability of charging you without swiping so BEWARE that your card may be on file). Coming to vacation as a family is more expensive than ever so our trip was meticulously planned which included our funds and let's just say two unauthorized charges were not in the plan. Now at this point our breakfast is completely ruined as the Assistant Manager Michael Greene refused to apologize, empathize, or even take ownership for what they did wrong. Instead he continuously talked over and interrupted my mother as she spoke. He even REFUSED to give the general managers name! If this is how the Mandalay Bay treats the military families of America then they truly need to rethink their customer service model & morals. P.s. the 1 Star is for our nice & kind server Pam.

The server was nice and came around constantly to check on her tables for drinks, condiments, clearing plates, etc.  The food was abysmal. The sushi section consisted of two trays of poorly made cheap rolls that looked like it came from the grocery store. The salad bar was small and cold section was limited to a handful of items. There was a made to order pasta bar. The rest of the hot food items were sitting under the lights for too long, making it dry, overlooked, and visually unappetizing. Selection was mainly American with pizza, pork loin, and ribs and Asian with fried shrimp, spring rolls, and general tso's chicken. Oxtail was tough and had no flavor. The dessert section was larger but it was obvious that they had been offered for the last several days. Even the cream on the tarts were hard. The filling of the crumble was okay but the topping was no longer crispy.",

We walked around the casino stopping to look at the menus posted outside of the different restaurants and so many entrees were $20-$30 for just a salad or a sandwich so when we saw that the all you can eat brunch buffet was only $25.99 we were sold! My husband who loves his meat dishes was in meat heaven. He loved loved loved the korean flavored marinated steak. He also enjoyed the prime rib, oso bucco and oxtail. I'm more of a seafood fan and was not as impressed with the selection. My go to dish at any buffet are the crab legs and the crab legs here are by far the scrawniest crab legs I've ever had. They also had shrimp cocktail which tasted fine, mussels, and a small selection of sushi which was more rice than actual fish. I saved a little room for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed their oreo cheesecake and soft serve ice cream in a waffle cone. Overall not a bad deal for the price, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back, but if I was already staying in the Mandalay or Delano, I'd be willing to eat here again.",

Note - the person seating you doesn't tell you this, but pastries are on the opposite side of the restaurant from the rest of the food choices.  Weird, and easy to miss.  Overall, recommended.",

My wife and I were very disappointed. The meat was dry, things tasted stale, the desserts tasted like something out of the frozen food section at the grocery store. It was definitely not worth the money. With so many great food options in Vegas, including many great buffets, this one should be skipped. You can tell the management is skimping, and that's very disappointing for what was once a great place.",

It was not good and some things such as all the salads were beyond sketchy.  I can't think of anything that I enjoyed when thinking about it now.  There was a good variety of options, but the quality was pretty low.  The decor is kind of old grandma style and the only saving grace was the service.  Also, it was Holiday pricing, so we paid something like $40 each.  I would think $15-$20ish is fair pricing for this spot.  I say skip this place if you're ever here during a special holiday pricing period because it is absolutely not worth it.",

    "text": "So, it's been a few years since we've been back to this buffet, despite staying here at least once a year.  Yup, we've avoided this place like the plague, since the last time it was a complete waste of time and calories.  It's been 3 years...  Nothing has changed.  The food was exactly as it was 3 years ago.  In fact, they probably made it 3 years ago and kept it in warmers in the back.    I'm sad they still haven't changed the way they make their food here.  They make everything well ahead of time, place it in warmers, and bring it out as needed.  This means it's been sitting there long, long, long before it ever reaches your plate, and you can definitely taste the difference.  Dry, dry, dry.    They even put some of the food out in the warmers with the plastic wrap still on.  People had to peel the saran wrap back themselves and risk 2nd degree burns.  Not worth it just to get a few dry eggs.    Last time the service was just about the only redeeming thing about this place.  This time around, even that was terrible.  Our server brought out our drinks at the beginning, then, that was about it.  Not a single refill.  Not one.  Not to mention this place was a incredibly dirty.  Food was everywhere on the ground.  I know there are more kids at this hotel, mine included, but there wasn't anyone doing floor cleanup.  Just nasty.  Yeah, since they really don't give a hoot about the quality here, I'd say take your money elsewhere.  Anywhere else but here.    $18/ adult weekday breakfast $13/ kid weekday breakfast  Still not worth it.",

The food options weren't as extensive as I imagined. There were the typical options, like pancakes, waffles, eggs etc. But nothing extraordinary. The regular eggs were actually pretty unappetizing, the omelet station looked good but the line was so long that no one from my party tried it.   The fruit selection was really weak too. They didn't have strawberries or raspberries for the pancakes. The only fruit I found was in a small section and consisted of melon chunks and something else (I forget, but it didn't look good regardless).  There was chicken breast that I believe was supposed to be Mediterranean. But it was SO dry I couldn't finish it. And it wasn't like we arrived toward the end of the breakfast portion, it was 9:00 a.m. so there should have been plenty of fresh food.   Overall it was really disappointing, don't waste your stomach space on it. Go over to the buffet at Caesars instead.",

    "text": "Ah, yes, here we have a place that combines two of the things I hate most: crappy buffets and long lines. This place has them both. A line to get in and pay. Then a line to be seated. Then lines at anywhere that has food, except for the standalone areas that most people seem either not to notice or notice, but want no part of.  The decor and interior seems like a really large family diner-style place, like Perkins or Elmer's or Denny's, etc. It's basically acceptable, but not much more. Drinks will be the only things served to you, but not very quickly. It doesn't matter. If you have discriminating taste at all, it will take you a while to find something that's above substandard. The prime rib seemed to do pretty well. The chile shrimp-in-the-shell was good the first time, but they clearly did not shock them in cold water on subsequent batches and all of the chitosan was fused to the meat. Fun. (Not.) I looked around for the crab legs and never did wind up finding those.  That was about all that was interesting on the lunch menu, including the dessert table. The iced tea, however, was one of the best I've had anywhere.  For breakfast, it was marginally better, with some omelets and so on being available. Tea served was a cheap one. It took a lot of digging, but the ham-based stuff seemed to do pretty well and everything else was mostly a misfire. The smoked salmon, in particular, was one of the largest disasters I've ever seen and equal parts woeful and shameful, with a dash of pathetic.  I know Vegas is known for its great buffets, but this is not one of them. This is a place that is expensive, with food quality ranging from poor to mediocre. Not only that, it is slow and I've never seen it without a line at the entrance, even when the place is only moderately full. Take a pass on this one. You can do better.",

The $20 included beer & wine so this is where to go to get the party started!  Whether you want to eat cold or hot queen crab legs, various italian dishes, a pasta station, Mexican and even some excellent Dim Sum.  There is nothing flashy here but the food is good but not mind-blowing good.  For the money it was a great buy.  I do wish the service team were a little friendlier & more attentive.

Upon viewing the selection of food I was kinda itching for a bit more but after taking a few bites from a well cooked steak with a perfect crusted salmon to go with it I instantly gave it high approval even with the less of a selection. The sides were very tasty too everything just had a good quality of taste to it.  Dessert wise I had a few pieces of cake that were equally outstanding.   The ambiance of this buffet was very relaxing with a slight dim of the light and some nice scenery outside the windows.  For a price of $30+ tax I was very happy with the choice once again quality gave it high reviews and easily made up for a lack of major selection of food.",

The peel and eat shrimp was mushy and slimy.  Even the fried shrimp was mushy.    2. They did not restock the food often enough.  The entire time I was there, there were things that were not restocked.  Essentially, it felt like many items were sitting too long.  3. The service was just ok.  The cashiers were not friendly and the server we had disappeared a lot.  4. Silverware was dirty.  5. Relatively small amount of menu items.  Most buffets I have been to in Vegas offer much more, especially for the price.  6.  Now this part is the worst....I GOT FOOD POISONING.  I believe it was probably from the buffet but I can't say that with 100% certainty (that is why I am putting it at the bottom of my list when it really should be at the top).  I do know that I did get the food poisoning from somewhere in the Mandalay Bay as that is the only place I ate all weekend.  I am pretty sure it was the buffet.  Overall, hated it and I will never go back!",

Selection was bland and there was an Italian station with Alfredo sauce but no noodles to put the sauce on and it wasn't because they were out if noodles they just didn't have them on the station at all.  There were stuffed Italian shells but they had cheddar cheese grated on them which looked awful.  The other items were dry and the temperature of the soup was barely warm.  Salad bar and next to nothing as far as variety.  Huge disappointment this time and I won't be going back.",

The food here is so half assed it should be criminalized. It lacks any innovation and quite frankly is extremely disrespectful to guest. To serve food this way is nothing short than just plain lazy. Where do I start? The eggs benedict.... the yolk is f***ing hard. It just soaks in  a warm bath until you pick that sad excuse for a dish up. Anything that is bread-like is dry. They were out of cream cheese that goes with the salmon. The meat is dry. Everything seems to have came out of a frozen meal box. Then the most blasphemous of all, the bacon had no flavor. Let me repeat that, THE BACON HAD NO FLAVOR! How in the hell is that possible? Oh and the desserts were so boring. They look good then you bite into them and finally know what it is like to taste disappointment.   save your money, go somewhere else. There are other places that are well deserving of your business than this place.   If it wasn't for their locationI am certain this place would have been out of business a long time ago.  Grade: F",

It's pretty pricey for the quality of food they serve. All breakfast items were so so, scrambled eggs were not so great, bacon wasn't crisp, however the large sausage was pretty good. The eggs Benedict was dry up and looked unappetizing.   They have a Chinese food section, however not worth trying. The crab legs were skinny and the shrimp were in shell and kind of fresh. The prime rib, ox tail, and ossobuco were the entrees I actually enjoyed.   The dessert section is solid tho.

    "text": "The buffet at Mandalay Bay stands out from the other buffets on The Strip in regards to the following observations from my dinner visit:  1) Dinner price of $29.99 plus tax (including unlimited beer, wine and champagne!) 2) Prime rib sliced to your plate 3) Cooked veal and beef ox tail (uncommon items to be found at a buffet, and typically very pricey at the market) 4) Made to order pasta dishes 5) Fresh flanked and panko crusted salmon 6) Decadent desserts including the tiramisu and coconut dishes  Service was quick to remove dishes off the table and refill waters and sodas. My only small complaint about the place is there are no steak knives or nutcrackers provided for the prime rib and crab legs dishes respectively. Overall this is a terrific and reasonable choice of a Las Vegas dinner buffet without putting a huge dent on your wallet like at the Bellagio or Venetian.",

Service was horrid - it took forever to get coffee, juice, creamer. I think our server was busing tables too, so maybe they were just understaffed. Every station had an insane line. The set up the restaurant is just bad - none of the sections have two sides so every area is a choke point.   The food was marginal, at best. This was such a horrid mistake - unless you are into Quantity over Quality, skip the buffet and eat at someplace like Citizens, instead.",

We even offered to move as to not be an inconvenience.   Very ordinary buffet offerings, some food looked old and unappetizing, nothing that wowed me. Prime rib was good, crab legs were ok. We asked what drinks were included. Only soft soft drinks, tea, coffee. No mention of champagne. Uhmmm...  Overall, very mediocre. For the price, you'd expect something better. Not worth it.",

I couldn't get enough salt on the eggs to flavor them - even though the salt shaker was VERY loose in its delivery.  The chicken fried steak was tough and tasted like it was made during the Carter Administration. The gravy didn't help. It tasted like it needed to be thrown out and start over.  The biscuits came out of a Pillsbury can?  Maybe not, but it was like eating a hockey puck.  Under cooked most likely and no flavor. Again biscuits and gravy shouldn't sit in your stomach like a lead ball.  About that gravy. Just, no. Someone took starch, water and flour and passed them each over this vat and declared it gravy.  The bacon was good. That's all.   Take my advice: go down on the strip to the Denny's. You'll get better food.",

The omelette station and carving station are never too busy and the seafood section has great options!   Most of the dining area has a view of the pool which is very calming. The ambiance is picturesque compared to other restaurants in the strip.   The waiters are hard working and always top off drinks and clear dirty utensils and plates. Remember to tip well!   I enjoyed the prime rib, peeled shrimp and pre cracked crab legs. They are perfect, and not frozen like other buffets in Vegas.   The champagne/mimosas are free flowing and a great compliment to whatever tickles your fancy.   When in the area definitely give this place a try!   For $30 a person you can't go wrong... If you play and use your card, it'll be even cheaper.",

In addition, this is a buffet where you have a pseudo-server who's in charge of your drinks (not self service stations like at Luxor), so I went thirsty for the majority of my meal.

I will admit this isn't you're typical buffet but there's still the possibility that you will over eat if you don't show a little restraint.   So what exactly does $32.95 get you, for one it gives you a choice to choose wisely or just be plain stupid. I usually like to do a tour before making my selections, the first thing I noticed was that all the serving dishes are small this is an added measure taken to protect the interest of The Bayside Buffet's owners but also protects you from yourself.   I always go for the carving stations and this buffet not only had plenty of those options but the quality was pretty good as well. My first plate held my prime rib, sliced turkey and a fried chicken breast and to be honest I loved every bite and could have stopped there but the trays of food were calling my name even though I chose to sit at a table as far away from the mounts of food as possible. My second plate was for the sushi and a few steamed dumplings and a few pieces of cheese. The most satisfying part of attending this buffet was the fact that I was able to avoid the cakes, pies, and cookies and even walked away from the donuts.",

I think a big, fancy breakfast buffet would go to waste on me so this was perfect for what we wanted.    The one thing I don't like is how they have the coffee cups upside down on the table.  The least they could do is put them on coasters so the lip of the glass (where you put your mouth) isn't resting on the table.  You hope the tables are wiped down after each gues, but you KNOW they aren't washed after each guest.  Blah.",

The sushi bar area had a nasty smell that not only is but over heard a few other people realize it and walked away. For $72 for 2 people you would expect better food and less wait time. I've eaten better food and \"old country buffet\" for $15 a person that what I ate here. Not to mention as we were leaving some rude ignorant people were yelling at other customers yelling racist comments and no one stopped there to escort them out or stop them. I will NEVER come back to this hotel establishment. My wife and I came here to watch the Michael Jackson show and was thrilled about eating here before the show and enjoying our time here. We had issues straight from the beginning with our tickets so our start here was not a good one. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in this hotel. Only thing good here was the show and the staff working the show. I know my review will not be read or even looked at by the staff at Mandalay bay, but for those who are wondering how the food is at the buffet.",

    "text": "Now jumping back to Las Vegas!  City of Sin!  (FOOD! FOOD! FOOD!)  Sometimes I do feel very guilty for eating all that food while I'm in town.... hmmmm....ok.. I'm over my guilt!  What's next?  The next up is the Bayside Buffet in Mandalay bay!  I'm sort of surprised by some of the so so reviews for this place because every time I've been here whether it's just 2 people or a party of 6+, we've always had great meals.  Although I can understand that buffets starts to look all the same after a while but still, you can taste if the food is done right or not and that should be the main focus of the reviews.  So here is what we've had... (it's a party of 5 this time around for lunch!)  Salad:  Little disappointed this time around because they had the bomb spinach salad... it's now nowhere to be found but just make your own salad.  Oh well, that shouldn't be my main focus anyway.  Pizza:  Decided to try the BBQ chicken.  Very comparable to CPK's BBQ except it doesn't have all the onions and other little veggie groups like CPK, but still it was tasty.    Hot meat section:  Unlike other buffets where eat stations are named differently, I don't recall there was a name to each of the areas but just simply a wrapped around line of food, so I'll call it the \"hot meat section!\"  Osso Buco was extremely tender and the flank steak was actually moist and soft!  No dry at all!  Then they had this thick piece of beef (can't recall what it was now) but it literally was so soft that by using you fork you can make it flake off from the entire piece of meat!  Everyone in the group was very much raving about this.  (I think it was part of the shank which is why it's so juicy and soft!)  Then the typical prime rib, ham, etc...  Custom pasta station:  A chef is behind 4 stoves with all the toppings you would want on your pasta served with I believe 3 different sauces (Alfredo, Marinara, and olive oil)  Very fresh and delicious looking, but I passed on the carbs to move to bigger and better things...   Hot Seafood Section:  Some typical Salmon, fried shrimp, steam halibut, etc.  Everything was decent and tasty, but nothing to get too crazy about except for the battered shrimp.  It was fried to perfection and each of them are XXL sized shrimp!  So you really get to have the shrimp instead of having the breading just like many other places.  Ethnic food section:  For some reason wasn't too into this today.... so passed on the Chinese/Mexican/Japanese fare with the exception of having couple pieces of sushi (California roll actually tasted good with fresh rice because some of the sushi in Vegas had Costco-like rice which is really nasty.. so it's refreshing to see at least this buffet is having good rice even though it's not a sushi restaurant)  Dessert section:  My only gripe about this dessert is that it didn't offer much of a ice cream selection.  However, they did have this trio of sugar-free purees (tiramisu, Hazelnut, Pastachio)  All were absolutely wonderful tasting with right amount of creaminess and right amount of aroma infused into them.... since they were small so I had like 6 of them!  LOL!  But dessert could be little better than others on the strip for a hotel such as Mandalay bay hosting this buffet.  Final Verdict:  Everyone still enjoyed this buffet and again I had no complaints.  I did however had less than usual because I took many small samples of it all and wasn't too hungry at that moment..  (I'm sure you all probably thinks I'm crazy now!  LOL!  Like.. what's up with this guy?  Does he have an endless stomach talkin' about that's not much food?  LOL!)  But Bayside Buffet is still one of the more enjoyable buffets on the strip if you ask me!    (Also, while you are at the casino, make sure you take a nice deep breath of coconut air!  Just stay away from the more smoky part of the casino.  It's actually pretty refreshing!)",

I came back this past weekend and was disappointed to hear they took the king crab legs off the menu about a month ago.  No more KING.....instead, steamed snow crab legs with melted butter on the side.  Melted butter added a nice touch, but I'm not a fan of the steaming...when you load up on 5# of it on one plate like me, the shell eventually starts changing colors to an off-white and the texture becomes rubbery, making it tedious to eat.  I do give credit for the jumbo sized cocktail shrimps, and the service was excellent.  At the dessert bar, the bread pudding with vanilla creme was good.  FYI Dinner is $30 (tax included).",

Are you staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel/Casino or don't mind trekking to the South end of the strip?  If you answered yes to the above four questions, then I highly recommend Bayside Buffet.  Bayside offers many of the items we now consider standard at any LV buffet.  What sets Bayside aside for me is that I can rely on crabs legs being available (as of late, many buffets have removed this 'attraction' from their offerings).  I also like the idea of all you can drink wine.  In terms of price, its priced at similar rates as other buffets.  On this visit, I definitely ate my money's worth and then some.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Quality - I can't say enough about how much better the quality of the food is. Rarely do I get that wow feeling from biting into buffet dishes.        - Selection - The buffet is a bit smaller and the selection is a little less varied than at other buffets. With that said, they also have better items you wouldn't find at other places.        - Attention to Detail - More on little surprises, they had scrambled eggs with lox and pecan syrup with actual pecans in it for your french toast. It's the little things that show the chefs at this place put pride into their menu. **Price**        - $15.99 Breakfast - 7am to 11am Mon to Fri        - $19.99 Lunch - 11am to 2:30pm Mon to Fri        - $27.99 Dinner - 4:45pm to 9:45pm        - $24.99 Weekend Brunch - 7am to 2:30pm Sat & Sun **Ate** (I came for brunch so these items are the from the brunch buffet)        - Prime Rib - I've never seen the prime rib overcooked. It's always soft and tender.        - Crab Legs - It's usually a hit or miss. This time they were dry.        - Cocktail Shrimps - Large and plump. You can't just have one.        - Clams - The clams were bit and fresh. A little sand in them though.        - Braised Ox Tail - Ox tails had a lot of meat on them and had good flavor.        - Beef Short Ribs (Not the kalbi kind) - Thick and fatty, they were pretty tasty.        - Baked Basa - The fish was cooked to perfection. I usually see the fish cooked too much and a bit dry in other buffets. **Recommendations**        - I'd definitely recommend this place for a weekend brunch buffet. For the dishes are of higher quality then even Wynn and Bellagio.",

You can find me stocking up on Bacon wrapped pork, fried shrimp, orange peel chicken, lo-mein, cheese quessidillas, prime rib, fried chicken, chicken marsala, more prime rib, and french toast for my first three plates. My fourth plate will be a generous salad to cleanse and balance, followed by an assortment of cakes, brownies, cookies, fruits, and some jelly thing that makes me welcome diabetic shock.

The food selection was severely lacking - lots of Asian and Stir fry, very little of anything else. Basic salad bar didn't even have shredded cheese or croutons.  What I did have was of poor quality - at 12:00 noon, the height of lunch hour, most foods were lukewarm at best.  The service was ok, but I guess I didn't really ask for a lot.  I was hungry an hour later, and had a MUCH better meal with my burger and fries poolside at the Beach Bar and Grill.  As buffets go, this is about on-par with Excalibur, with a slightly better setting. Aria is much better in terms of atmosphere, selection, and overall food quality.",

    "text": "I'll start with 4 stars for the Bayside Buffet, located in Mandalay Bay, for the food. They kept the shrimp coming, they had some really killer steak, and the fruit was ripe and edible.  However, they had us standing just inside their entry area for about 15 minutes while they tried to figure out if they could accommodate our group of 10, regardless of the fact that we had told them they could just split us up and put us anywhere. We could see huge expanses of tables open. No idea what the hell was going on there. By the time we had been seated, several of the guys had already gone and eaten two plates worth of breakfast.  Drinks were served quickly enough, though there was some confusion as to who ordered what.  Price was reasonable for a buffet with the quality of food they had. But there is a lot of competition in this town. I seriously didn't need to be standing there that long, caffeine-less.",

    "text": "Pretty decent Brunch: $23.99 unlimited champagne!!   The main attraction of any buffet is the prime rib, seafood, and desserts.  \"Bayside\" buffet is just average for all three.  The prime rib was overcooked and seemed like it was last night's batch. The very middle of the rib roast was well done!! I probably came at a bad time.  The seafood is pretty decent here.  The Shrimp cocktail are of a very large size compared to Wynn and Bellagio.  The king crab legs (frozen..errr chilled) were split and of decent size as well.  I wouldnt' say they were as large as the ones at Wynn but good enough to enjoy.  The problem I had was that they over salted the legs so it was a little hard to eat.  I don't know if it was done on accident or just part of the preservation chemicals used on the legs.  Moving on, desserts were pretty crappy actually.  Nothing really looked good but taking a waffle cone filled to the top with ice cream was really great for the long walk back to my car!!  Everything else served is your standard buffet, breakfast stuff, pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc.  Nothing to write home about.  I do think for $23.99 you can get max value out of the buffet by just focusing...err \"enjoying\" the more expensive foods and the drinks.",

Rio - yes, lots of food but not quality food. Bellagio - simply overrated! And the list goes on...  I have to admit, this place has a lot of good quality foods.  They served all kinds of food such as: turkey, chicken, crabs, scallops, fried shrimp, etc. It was a wide selection. Maybe not as wide of a selection as Rio, but the quality of the food was ten times better!   I would definitely come back here again.

I like how they have stations where you can pay by cash or card for the buffet rather than just a line (which, in my experience, can get craaazy backed up).  The service was great; we had a group of around ten and we were constantly being given refills and our plates were taken away on a regular basis.

Being sort of cheap I usually stay at Excalibur and at least once each stay go to the buffet.  Last Christmas I decided to spend an extra $5 and try the buffet at the Luxor and was well rewarded.  So this year I opted to spend yet another $5 ($26.99 +tax) to see what it got me.  Last year at the Luxor was much better.  Very small salad bar. Limited cooked vegetables.  Several meat and starch dishes, almost all were cold or lukewarm.  Several of the seafood items (hot and cold) were soggy.  I did leave room for dessert and it was very good.  This place has all the pieces in place to be good and they just are not pulling it off well.  They have several seafood offerings, they use smaller warming trays so they get changed out more often which should keep food warm and not dried out.  I ate between the opening rush and the 7PM dinner rush so the place was only about 80% full and the lines were reasonable.  My server kept my plates cleared and my Iced tea full.  I did notice this trip the entire MGM family seems to be cutting back on quality and value compared to when I was there in July.",

A fellow yelper mentioned that the decor was similar to Souplantation, I have to agree, but I have to add that the Sunday Breakfast at Souplantation is WAYYY better!  It was really sad, everything was soggy and bland. Their fruit bar was the worst! Oranges was bitter and grapefruits were dried out and lasted like its been sitting there for weeks, yuck.  Basically, not as bad as Cravings at the Mirage, but I had to spit out too much for it to get 3 stars!   Once again, go to Wicked Spoon :)",

Despite having to wait 15 for a server to offer me a drink, the biggest issue I had was the carved meat station. For $30+, when I ask for rare meat, that does not mean give me the oldest, driest and most overcooked piece. When I asked for a different piece that was rare, the man behind the station kept saying \"Sorry, that's it\" I asked again if I could have a rare piece and was told I needed to take the piece he cut. Once I was acknowledged, the wait staff was great! In the future, I will be looking into a different buffet... the Indian gaming casino's have much better offerings.",

First of all I'm not a fan of buffets, I believe they all have the same cafeteria tasting food but once in a while I get the urge to prove myself wrong about my opinion on buffets. I was looking for somewhere to eat and i decided to eat here but before I went in I did go online and check out their lunch/diner menu. It showed what they had and one item that caught my eye was the shrimp with salt and pepper, which I definitely do enjoy. I payed $30 per person and we walked right in, the service wasn't  bad but as I'm walking around to check what they had I couldn't help to notice that they didn't have that item. I asked one of the workers and she had no clue of what I was talking about, so I pulled out my phone and showed her the menu which was like talking to myself because she still didn't know. I decided to try some of the other food but had no flavor, over cooked and just not enough options. For 30 dollars per person definitely will not recommend this place. Won't eat there again.",

    "text": "As a general rule I like to hit the buffet when I go to Vegas. There are good ones and there are bad ones. Personally I think this is one was good and bad. I actually ended up coming here twice for two reasons: the crab legs and the butterscotch cookies.   First Visit: I came closer to 8:00 to avoid the ridiculous line that forms around 6:00. i got through the line pretty quick but the visit started out shaky. The hostess told me that a sever would take my drink order. So I waited at my table for my drink order and a woman comes up tells me her name and literally throws my straw at me and asks me if i wanted a drink. She seemed to very irritated. I sat there shocked and I noticed that a couple sitting in a table across stared and sat their open mouthed shocked as well by how rude she was. I asked for a Pepsi and she went on her way. After she left the woman from the other table said \"well I guess you are going to get the same service as us.\" Apparently she was rude to them too. Honestly, I could care less after i got my drink. I thought i did not really need her for anything else. As i went to help myself to the food I saw there was quite a variety of different foods. They had Mexican, Spanish, Asian, Italian, salad, soups, prime rib, and best of all crab legs! of course I made a beeline for the crab legs. I grabbed some and some salad for my first place. The crab legs were great! The meat was tender and good. I was trying to crack the legs myself by breaking them in half with my hands when my lovely waitress ran by and dropped a crab leg cracker at my table. After that she was totally different toward me. So attentive and nice. It was like a different person. I don;t know, my guess is because I did not really ask her for anything but a drink in the beginning? Don;t really know. But when I went for a second plate I helped myself to more crab legs and some fried rice and a pizza slice. The pizza was ok and the fried rice was gross. I really liked the crab legs though. now for dessert. I went and grabbed some butterscotch cookies that just looked good and they were the best cookies I have ever eaten. I eve took some with me! LOL. I know that is bad but they were that good. The ice cream sucked. Honestly by the time I left I was more than satisfied with the crab legs and butterscotch cookies.   Second Visit: Much longer line this time probably cause it was Christmas. I don't know I wanted to try the prime rib this time so I decided to go back on whim. Having more butterscotch cookies as a holiday treat could not hurt either. The line was long but once I got in and seated it wasn't bad. Got my drink pretty quickly. Went and grabbed some prime rib and crab legs first. The prime rib was just ok, Nothing to write home about, I grabbed more crab legs and after that went for the butterscotch cookies. They were just as amazing as last time.   Overall, with the exception of the crab legs and butterscotch cookies everything was either looked kinda gross or was gross. I don't think I would advise someone to spend $30 just to try a couple of things. Go for it if you want to. I might go back I might not. I mean the crab legs suffice as a good meal for me.",

No need for sauce, or any condiments. It was great as is. Awesome flavor.  3. The Asian salad was tasty and fresh.   Cons:  1. The flank steak was as dry as sandpaper used to clean up a Vegas strip  2. Dessert options were limited.  Overall it was ok, we got our grub on, but was disappointed.  Oh ya, We planked there too!

Like any buffets, there are some great parts and some really crappy parts. The salad bar, which seemed rarely touched was great. The vegetables were crisp and you could pretty much make any salad imaginable with all the ingredients.   The pizza I never touched, it looked good, but I didn't pay $29 including tax to nosh on pizza. The highlight of the buffet were probably the crab legs and the prime rib. Who doesn't love prime rib?   Definitely a lot of carnivore options!  The stuffed chicken was pretty good as well as sides such as mashed potatoes and gravy. The short ribs were succulent.   The Asian/Indian part of the buffet was pretty pathetic, and untouched. As was the spanish/mexican part of the buffet. Sorry looking beans, tikka masala, paella etc. I probably wouldn't go back.   They have some table by the window to look out side or more comfortable booths. The desserts weren't all that great looking, I had a fabulous chocolate cookie, but otherwise. If it weren't for the delicious prime rib and great service it would be 2 stars.",

They request a tip at that point which I thought was strange, but whatever.  I walked up to the counter to give my ticket, and the rude hostess stated that I, \"needed to take myself over there.\"  Ummm....okay?  The hostess who sat us was pleasant.    We sat and waited a few minutes and a lady walked by and told us to go eat with out taking our drink order.    Walking up to the line I was excited to see all the seafood, and there were two different selections of fish.  Thats it!  No shrimp.  No crab legs.    The rest of the food was mushy or lacking flavor.  Basically I paid $25 for boxed mashed potatoes.   From reviews it looks like breakfast is decent, otherwise I would stay away.  Plus its freezing in there.  My friend had to use the restroom (which they don't have one in the buffet) and they almost didn't let him back in because they were \"closed.\"",

My travel companion wanted to eat here though so we did and it was delicious.   I had all kinds of goodies. I remember having a salad, some sushi pieces, some Mexican food items and a few different small dessert bites.   I asked to be seated in a quieter area away from kids and they obliged seating us in the back glassed in room to the far part of the buffet. It was very pleasant.   Our server was also pretty good.   I had a good experience here I just wish I could've eaten more because I know my food intake wasn't anywhere close to the cost per person.",

Wish I had opted for McDonalds (as nasty as they are they are at least cheaper)!",

    "text": "Vegas should be called the land of the buffets. You will probably pass 5 more on your way here from your room.   This particular buffet is good. The brunch (which is what we came for) was decent enough. There were lots of breakfast options mixed with a good smattering of lunch dishes. Traditional breakfast things like eggs, french toast, breads, fruit dishes, & oatmeal can be found in abundance. They also had a number of seafood options including crab, sushi, and one other white fish which I thought was particularly unpleasant. There are also plenty of options in terms of desserts. The little tiramisu cups are a favorite. I was happy these seemed to be ubiquitous in Vegas.   The atmosphere is fun. I was particularly happy that this restaurant wasn't outfitted with a superfluous amount of gaudy flourishes or decorations. It was simple and to the point while still fitting with the resort-style feel of Mandalay Bay.   The waitstaff was quite phenomenal. The lady who helped our table was funny, warm, and very amicable. I REALLY liked her. She was, without a doubt, the highlight of our experience here.   For the price, there's plenty of food. If you're a vegetarian though, you're pretty much stuck with eggs, bread, and oatmeal (which I heard was very good, actually). For most, it's a great option if you're staying in the area and don't want to go far.",

They surprisingly served breakfast items still (maybe it was brunch) such as bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, sausage, ham, and others. They also have sushi selection, carved turkey, fried chicken, pastas, mussels, shrimp, salad bar, fruit bar, and desserts.  Overall, the food was fresh and tasty. Good selection to choose from.",

    "text": "What a time to be alive!?   Ah yea yea it's always great but hey this Mandalay Bay buffet is a great bang for your buck I must say! From the elegant entrance to the fact that they cook your steak the exact way you want it (had to add that I'm a well done guy). This is a great choice in comparison to the surrounding fine dining options.  My wife and I came here for dinner which costs 32.99. We were greeted by an older man named Lee who let us actually browse the buffet before purchasing the meal. He was very clutch for that I might add, being the fact we were kind of on the fence about paying 32.99 for \"just another buffet\". Our server was a really sweet older lady named Gloria and she was on her service in top fashion which is always greatly appreciated I think we all can agree on.  My favorite food choices were the tamales ( tamale lovers will dig ) the sweet n sour chicken, pizza, steak, fried rice and any of the chicken. There's also solid dessert selection worth cheating with a little bit.   Only few things that I have to say that I would like to see is maybe a burger / beef patty option along with hot bread / rolls because the breads are just in a plastic container at room temperature to get at your convenience.   All in all the Bayside Buffet is worth it! Especially since it kinda has the exact or remotely similar food here in relation to the surrounding fine dining options. From the customer service to the atmosphere to the food quality you get is absolutely worth the money. Come check it out.  I hope this helps!",

Went with my kids and usually I have to monitor the amount of desserts they put on their plates. Didn't have this issue here. All they grabbed was a chocolate chip cookie and didn't even finish it. They wanted some ice cream but the soft serve machine was not working. The only thing I did enjoy were some cream filled crepes they had. Those were actually pretty good, which is the reason I think this place deserves one star. Please, save your money and go elsewhere.",

In addition, they're Italian meatballs are divine, and the fried chicken was good enough to eat a whole bucket full. Those were my favorites! This buffet isn't as large and full of variety like most, but I believe that they put out good quality, fresh food items. I was surprised to see blueberries and strawberries as vibrant.  Tip: on your way out, grab a couple cookies, pastries, whatever or a cone of ice cream because this buffet is pricier than the Paris buffet.  Good For: coconut macaroons, fried chicken",

The size of the crab varies time to time, sometimes they are big. meaty, and sweet while other times they are small with little meat.  The service here is excellent, especially for a buffet since you mainly serve yourself. The waiters always make sure your glass is full and/or you need a new plate, etc. If you want more selection with about the same quality I recommend going to the buffet at Plant Hollywood (Old Aladdin).

    "text": "A stinker. You know, I'm having a hard time trusting people's review, especially when a user's average review rating is four to five stars for several hundred reviews. Does that mean the majority of buisnesses are winners? I guess I'm gullible.  Bayside Buffet is a prime example of why I shouldn't be so eager to try a place recommended by Yelpers. And yet, Im writing one, too! Double standards am fail.  Anyway, bitching aside, my lunch here was super meh. 20 dollars paid at the kiosk, then briskly seated facing away the window (wut?), and then hoarded to the buffet line on both sides of the room. Immediately, I had a nagging feeling the experience would be super meh. How? Oh, let's see...the buffet selection is hella small! My college cafeteria offered more food than this -- and at better quality!   So what did I get?  Meats, a few starches, but mainly stuff jammed with protein.  Lambchops: Ugh. Below super meh. The lamb was gamey and foul tasting, an instant spit-out-of-the-mouth-and-eat-somethingelse-to-purge-the-mouth type thang. Minus points. Pork ribs: Wow, surprisingly soft, but lacked flavor. This was the best entree at the buffet. Turkey: Eh, thanksgiving turkey cut in your choice of dark or white meat. The carver was very nice, but the meat quality was very poor. Braised beef: This better be soft, or else I'm leaving! Fortunately for me, the beef was soft, though a weird aftertaste soured my mouth. Flank steak: Worst meat. I couldn't get steak down my mouth, because the texture was way too chewy. TOO CHEWY. Inedible. Even beef jerky is softer than this flank steak. Mash potatoes: Wait, yelpers, you like this crap? Buttery? Yummy? Uh... I give up.   Dessert Forget the banana pudding, the fruit pudding, the cakes, the brownies; the best dessert is the frozen yogurt. YES. Better than McDonalds frozen yogurt, the barometer for tasty, creamy, consistent goodness. The vanilla custard yogurt was by far the best part of the meal...  ...and the saddest part of the experience. Deserts over meats and entrees? Bayside Buffet, you fail.   And, oh, your service sucks.",

She asked my husband if he was the same guy that was sitting there a moment ago. I guess people try to cheat in these places but c'mon....It was over halfway through our meal.   After I thought the waitress forgot my request for a steak knife (she didn't say anything about it when she was serving the table next to ours) she really didn't. It just took her a while. So I felt bad for mentally berating her for her ignoring my request.  The dessert section was probably the best. Nice chewy cookies. I had an oatmeal cranberry one.

Now...being the fat ass that I am, everything being fried is mostly fine by me, but it was just plain overwhelming here.  I actually really enjoyed the make your own pasta bar.  It was like Mongolian BBQ for white people.  I kid, I kid...but honestly it was one of the best things this buffet has got going for them.

But granted there were about 40 of us here for a family reunion, it was OK I guess.  Not only do they lose stars for the food, but they were just RUDE when we tried to move the tables around to just sit closer together.  Ummm...excuse us!! We haven't seen each other in YEARS!

I am not a breakfast person really, so I can't speak to the breakfast or brunch they serve, but I love me some lunch/dinner options.  Of all the Vegas buffets, I think this is the best quality (albeit, they have a smaller selection of food than other buffets - but you know quality over quantity yadda yadda yadda).  Things I love here: - the already peeled large shrimp cocktail - cracked crab legs (these are better than anywhere else, I could eat my body weight in them...I may have in fact) - Prime rib, they rock the cashbah on this one - Chinese fried shrimp - the antipasti bar  - your drink glass will never go empty (especially if you tip when you pay) - they have the best views of the tropical pool area  Things that suck here (and every other buffet you'll ever go to) - the desserts, I don't know why, but NO buffet has good desserts! - made to order pasta (what a waste of time and stomach space anyway!)  Overall- great buffet!!",

The cost was about $30 for an adult on a saturday night which I was pretty suprised about because I remember this buffet as not being as great as others but i thought it would mean that the price would be cheaper too. The food is decent, but not the best. If you like pasta I would suggest that you go to the pasta bar where a chef handmakes your pasta. The crab didn't taste nearly as good as the crab at Bellagio. The salmon was dry. I mean...if you want average food then this would be the place to go. But if you want higher quality food then I would suggest going to the Bellagio Buffet on Sunday night where the price is $30 as well but includes so much more selection.   P.S. There is no sushi at this buffet, no creme brulee, no cheesecakes. The dessert selection is limited.",

The crab legs were fine, prime rib was tender and juicy, there were delicious, piping-hot tamales, and they had the most amazingly fluffy yet custardy bread pudding! None of the other dishes were really memorable, but nothing was truly offensive, either. Our server was particularly thoughtful about disposing of our discarded crab leg shells and supplying us with seafood picks and wet naps.   For the price you pay, you can definitely do worse in terms of Vegas buffets. Bayside Buffet  may not be in the same league as Wynn or Bellagio, but it costs half as much!",

I don't think I enjoyed it $29-worth, but since I was with a good group + I ate my fill, I'd for sure say it was worth it this past weekend.  The crablegs were delicious -- good texture (firm, not mushy), and although they were a little sea-tasting, I dug the flavor (perfectly salty!)  Macaroni rocked. As did the potatoes croquettes.  My friend's egg-white omelette looked delicious :D  I could list a whole bunch more random foods -- I'll summarize and say there was a pretty decent selection, and everything tasted pretty decent, too.  I'd say 3.5 stars, but will bump up to 4.  (Plus, unlike anything I've experienced before, their service rocked -- servers came by constantly to see if we needed anything (we did stay for 3+ hours, hee) and were really friendly -- and this was between 11 and 2:30!)",

There was no one in line... that should have been my first sign to walk away and try something else... but we had been here before and it wasn't that bad.  The prime rib, cold crab legs, and hot crab legs are the star of this buffet. Other than that, there isn't much that is tasty. I liked the beef empanadas, but they were a little too salty. The shrimp tempura was good, but tasted exactly like the kind you can buy from Costco. The desserts area was lacking, but they do have very tasty cookies... especially the one with white chocolate and cranberries! I also really enjoyed the vanilla sauce with the bread pudding.  The service was ok. Our plates stacked up with 3 or 4 dishes before being taken away, but our drinks were brought out and refilled in a timely manner.   I wouldn't suggest coming here if you are only going to go to one vegas buffet during your trip. But it's not bad, it's just not as good as the Bellagio or Wynn Buffets.",

I have no idea if the brunch was any better than usual or if they jacked up the price since they could get away with it that day. Pricey for brunch buffet, I would've liked it better if it was a few dollars less. Food was pretty good though.  Interesting that its kinda like going to a movie theater since they have kiosks where you pay for your meal. No wait when I went at round 11. They then tried to seat us in the dark area, but we requested to be seated near the large windows. Of course, we got what we wanted, but was also seated next to a large party of very loud people with a little boy they let do whatever he wanted. So a tradeoff...sunlight vs quiet. It's a good thing that you walk off a lot in buffets.  The placement of the food is a bit odd in a way, the regular food and the dessert were separated by a huge main room. Hehe limiting temptation maybe? Anyhow, they had a good selection of regular lunch food and breakfast, and a wide assortment of pastries and breads and desserts.  Main things that stood out to me, duck, hash browns, and the pastries and desserts. I really have a soft spot for anything light and flaky and baked. Haha. I ate a buncha other things too that I remember liking, salmon, asparagus, braised short ribs and all the other miscellaneous breakfast items. Duck was nice and tender with the skin crispy. Mmmm...I wanted more but didn't wanna fill up on heavy stuff before my ride home. Hash browns were in big triangle shapes that were really crispy and yummy. Oki so like McDonald's hash browns basically hehe. And the pastries...I only had room for a chocolate croissant but I wanted to try everything else they had. They also had make your omelettes, crab legs, prime rib, some asian food, etc etc, but I didn't really eat any of that.    And so, a good place for brunch, but try not to come during holidays. No idea about dinner time. Pastries...",

The quality was good, just disappointed on the lack of selections and having to wait for certain food items. I would not go back just because there are so many other places to choose from in Vegas.

So I was so excited to eat there again last night. It was an experience almost 24 hours later I am still upset about. It was by far the worst buffet (and quite seriously some of the worst food) I've ever paid for. The shrimp alfredo pasta was watery and tasted nothing like alfredo sauce. The ribs were dry and rubbery. The potstickers were barely warm and so dry I could hardly cut them. The mashed potatoes were clearly from a mix and had way too much water added. There was no prime rib but something called steam ship. It was dry and tough. As we were leaving, my husband saw a uniformed employee eating prime rib in the dining area. Obviously they kept it hidden from the general public. The seafood jambalaya looked good but tasted like old fish. I thought for sure the desserts might redeem the whole experience, but no. It was very slim pickings. The cakes were dry and flavorless while the \"crumb topping\" on the apple pie looked mushy. We had a 30% off coupon bringing the price down to $23. I am shocked that a resort like Mandalay Bay can get away with serving such awful food. Maybe they're trying to drive customers to eat in their fancy restaurants. Save your money and drive to the M Casino south of the strip. Same prices but delicious food, huge variety and amazing desserts.",

The spread is great. Top 5 things in this buffet: Panko crusted salmon, oxtail stew, grilled steak, bbq chicken pizza, and CRAB LEGS! I would make this the 2nd best buffet in Vegas next to Bacchanal Buffet in Ceasars. No complaints here...",

The sushi was horrid but understandable as the women at the sushi station were speaking in Spanish to each other.  The cheese cubes even were fairly bland.  Mandalay Bay is a beautiful resort and one of my favorites but this is a bad representation of their dining options.    On the way back home, we stopped in Primm and ate at Primm Valley's buffet and it was much better than Mandalay's.  That is just sad.  Actually Sizzler or Hometown Buffet is better.  I'll gladly stay at Mandalay Bay or Four Seasons, but will go to Mirage for a buffet.",

NO ONE came to tell us that in another 1/2 hour they were going to take out all the food and close for Thanksgiving Dinner (which they don't usually do).  HELLOOOOO, if you are going to take out all the food before the lunch people finish eating, at least have the DAMN courtesy to tell us at least on the line to pay, or have the waitresses go around and let us know that that is going to happen... we just ate a little, and then when we were going for our second round, pufffffff nothing..... are you kidding me!!!!!!    So, we waited to see if they were going to put food out, but then the \"manager\" came at 3:45pm and told us that they are going to served dinner but if we wanted to stay we can pay the extra difference for dinner, that they usually don't close the restaurant, but because it was thanksgiving they were doing this.... OK... why you didn't show up 1/2 hour before they took out all the food or let us know ahead of time that you will pull this stunt!!!??!?!?!?  then she started saying that the waitress don't usually do this, that is when we pay, the cashier will tell us, but only if we paid by 2:30pm, because at 3 pm they remove the food... HELLO... I paid at 1:59pm, waited in line to be seated for another 30 minutes, so that was 2:30pm, and then you took out the food by 3:00pm.... that was so not fair.... BAD MANAGEMENT!!!! they just want to get our money!  Not even on the lowest chinese buffets they do that to the customers, they will go around and let them know that they have only like 10 or 15 minutes to grab whatever else they want before the remove all the food.    STUPID Management!!!!! you need to be better organized during holidays... if not, you'll get more people pissed off at your BADDDDDDDDDD horrible service!!!!    We are not going back again! you guys are BAD!",

A lot of special attention can be tasted throughout.  I had the best lamb chops grilled by Chef Edward himself since my trip to Greece 20 years ago.  He can be seen behind the buffet tables teaching and directing his staff.  He brought me a whole jar of Kimchi from the back.    It was Father's Day and he prepared special meals for the Day.  Other places only do that for Mother's Day.  You can tell he is very proud of every dish he offers and the staff also seems to share the attitude.     Special but simple spices to usual buffet varieties can be tasted.  We were very satisfied.  We will go back again if only just for the buffet.",

I went here because some online site said they served a little bit of seafood. The only seafood I saw was your typical shrimp cocktail, and a soup with very little crab legs in it This buffet should be categorized as more \"American\" in offering than seafood.  I ate around 12 pm which is prime lunch time. Being disappointed that there was no seafood, I picked a bunch of the standard things. However, the food already felt dry from sitting out too long. I ate what I could from their limited selection.  I may or may not give this place a second chance. The service was okay, but the food just wasn't very good.",

A few things we were pretty sure they were sour. Even the bread was stale and hard. Desert which is normally my favorite in buffets was barely edible. I couldn't even eat the canoli I did complain and the server did say the help has changed recently. It was NOT a good value and cost almost $60 for two adults, one child for lunch.

My only complaint is the 2:30 dinner change but that's really because off my scheming self.   When I tried to get food around 345 and realized the food was all gone except for salad, bread and sushi, the server then told me I have to leave before 430 and that all the food has been removed for breakdown and cleaning in preparation for the dinner shift. Which would've been okay if the cashier or my server had told me about a last call or had it written down somewhere. Not after it happened and I'm still hungry!not worth paying $20+ for salad, bread and hard sushi.   Prime rib is uncharacteristically sweet. Panko salmon is great. Skip the sushi and the Chinese.",

I had never heard of this cut of meat before but me as a surgical anatomist and an aspiring butcher I looked into it. Steamship is the top round cut of meat with the femur bone included. This is a lean, cheap primal cut of meat. This is very very different than prime rib. It still tasted good but it is not prime rib. The crab legs were salty and scrawny.

This might have been good once, but I fear it's gone downhill and no longer reflects the quality and excellence of the MGM brand.  Six of us were eager to try out the famous Vegas buffets last night. We went here assuming Mandalay Bay would be a lock. Hostesses were excellent, prices reasonable.  At 7:30pm we found a few glum patrons picking at their food.  I saw a few steam tables and searched for the main buffet area. But a few steam tables, a salad bar and a little sushi/fruit area were all there was. This is smaller than a buffet back home!  After trying and failing to eat, the rest of the party concentrated on getting their money's worth from the bottomless beer.  The food was bland, meat options overly fatty, variety severely lacking.  I found the manager and walked her through the most serious issues.  - bartender had a leg and butt cheek up on the salad bar table. - salad bar was thrashed, with ingredients and dressing everywhere. Two staff were standing by the salad bar. They never moved to clean it up. Manager said she usually cleaned it herself but hadn't had a chance to get to it. - two platters of sushi contained no fish, were broken and smashed, and fell apart. Manager said the rice wasn't made correctly, but she couldn't do anything about it. - multiple serving spoons and tongs had handles laying in adjacent food. Food was dropped and dropped across the serving areas. Manager also said she usually did that. Other workers wouldn't move to clean anything. - no prime rib. Instead a small beef roast was present. Our deer-dressing manly men could hardly cut it, it was so tough. Unable to chew at all. Manager's response was that they had steak knives upon request.  Throughout all this the manager was very nice and understanding. She was able to refund one of our bills, but not the others for folks who had tried and failed to eat.  What would fix this? A relentless focus on cleanliness, excellence and attention to detail. If you have little to work with, at least do it the very best. Don't let handles lay in food, have someone dedicated to continually cleaning up serving areas and spills on floors. Demand quality for the small selection of food available. Care!  Mandalay Bay has plenty of other great food options. But the Bayside Buffet is truly the worst food I've found in Vegas.",

    "text": "First I have to say that the service was an A+!  The waiter was very attentive and very friendly.  We got there around 1pm and the food selection was great but the restaurant was not busy so the food turnover was not there.  I noticed that the sushi wasn't the freshest.  The avocado on some of them were browning and the fish just didn't look appealing at all.  I took the last avocado rolls and noticed that they did not refill the item the whole time we were there.  My husband enjoyed the freshly made pasta as he selected the pasta, sauce and fixing in the pasta.  They had a good selection of Asian, Mexican, Italian and American food.  The food quality was not the best but overall it was not the worse.  I just wonder if I had came earlier if the food turnover would have been better.   The dessert selection was above average.  I enjoyed the carrot cake and cheese danish.  Lastly, I did thought the place was very clean and had a great atmosphere.  We sat next to the window and enjoyed the view of their outside.",

One thing I did not like about that was paying for the tip prior to receiving any service.   We were seated then looked over the buffet.  Everything you'd want was there.  Prime rib, Mexican, Asian, seafood, salad bar and desserts.   All the items I tried were good but not great.  There was nothing so fabulous that I wanted to go back for seconds.  I tried several items from each section but overall it was just okay.  For example, the potstickers were as expected but the rice dough was slightly too thick and they had been sitting awhile.  The desserts were really good and small portions so you could try a couple without overeating, perfect.  My son loved the soft serve.  It was very good.  Our waitress was very slow.  We sat there ten minutes past when I wanted to leave just to get an iced tea.  I had nothing to drink in the hotel room so really needed the tea.  Oh well, it gave me time to watch this tiny Cross Fit girl shovel three huge plates of food into her tiny person...quite a show!",

It was part of the buffet so I ordered water, coffee and orange juice. The selection of the menu was sad. They repeated some of the dishes in different stations so there was not a lot of variety. They had an omelet station where the chef will cook how you like your omelet.   The selection of the menu was from scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, croissant, sausage, harsh brown, steak, salmon, turkey, fruits, desserts and etc... Nothing really stood out for me. The sushi was very disappointing. It felt like it been there a couple of days. The rice was disgusting nasty. Definitely skip that. We asked the server when is the lunch selection coming out because we came there around 12. The server told us they will be serving brunch, whatever they are offering now all day until dinner. My friends and I were disappointed. We were looking forward for crab legs and ox tail soup.  Definitely not a big fan of this place.",

First off customer service, we got the grouchiest waitress I've ever encountered, no smile, no hello, just \"drinks?'\" me: a pepsi, 3 waters and a hot tea please.. then she walks away without acknowledging what I just said. At least she remembered and she did get the order right but forgot the straws. None of us wanted to make the grump grumpier so we just let it be. Food is the real reason they get one star. Small selection and it seemed like they were being stingy with what they put out there. Like the picture of the mountain of shrimp cocktail on here...nah it didn't look like that at all, there was maybe like 50 shrimp out there the whole time we were there. They had mexican food, but no condiments to go with it. Really thats what upset me the most, lack of condiments to flavor the lackluster food. I mean if the food is amazing then no I wouldn't care about condiments but the food was far from that, I think it barely hits fine. Their desserts are blah, wouldn't be surprised if they were boxed..or premade a month in advance, frozen and thawed when needed. They did have an unlimited alcoholic drinks option for an extra $10+ dollars. Everything looks better after a few bottles/glasses of anything so I guess this would be good option for if I ever need to eat here again.  Total disappointment. What a mistake it was coming here to eat, a few more dollars and a short car ride and we could've gone to Wicked or Rio. I wasn't the one who paid for the meal here but I left feeling ripped off.",

They don't validate parking which cost me another 9 bucks on top of expense for 3 people dining there I will never go there again nor I will recommend it to nobody   If you want better experience try Wynn. My friends were really impressed after visiting Wynn - such a positive difference",

We did have a very large party so I understand that the server may not be able to accommodate all of us immediately but he wasn't at all. Several of us asked for water refills and he never brought it out to us. He did have a little attitude with us. Would not recommend this buffet.",

Breakfast runs until 11:00 AM and has the following:  - Carving station turkey and ham - Omelet station (red onions, mushrooms, ham, bell peppers, cheese) - Bacon, sausage, waffles, pancakes French toast, cereal, chicken fried steak, tater tots, hash browns, fruit, oatmeal - Dessert bar with cakes, cookies and soft serve  The breakfast buffet ended up being about $25 a person after taxes. Our server was courteous and efficient. Drinks were brought promptly and used plates were constantly being cleared. We came at 9:30 AM on a Monday and it was not crowded at all. This was great for getting seated immediately. However, it also meant the food wasn't being turned around quickly in the heating trays. So there was times where meats or carbs would be really dried out from sitting there too long.",

You get the Mandalay price and more of a circus circus food choice. Don't get me wrong the food wasn't horrid.... it's just I expected more. There was nothing special about the food. Nothing that made you say goodness I need to come back here. I did like that they had a pasta station where they cook your pasta made to order.... but the cosmo has the same thing.  Three stars because the staff was really awesome. Lance was great. Even though he was manning the pasta station  he was very attentive to other stations as well.  Point of the story, don't go with high expectations. It's an okay buffer but if you want bang for you buck bacchanal @ Cesars is the way to go!!!",

Our server came by only twice throughout our time there. one time was to take our drink order and the second time to drop off our drinks. Inattentive service.  The food was all very bland or very dry. I didn't even eat a whole plate of food. After I picked at a few things on my plate and figured I couldn't eat it anymore, I decided to give the desserts a try... Not a bad idea right? Ehhhh. I put a few things on my plate and the only good thing was the NY cheesecake in a cup.  If you like to waste food & money, this would be a place to go.",

If you can't find something to eat at Bayside Buffet, then you really ought to broaden your horizons.  Bayside Buffet offers a vast selection of breakfast and lunch foods at around brunch time -- I found nothing that I could truly say I disliked, though their was some sort of Asian chicken (orange chicken?) that was bland. Other than that, this is a solid buffet. The breakfast Mexican options were probably my favorite part, but all of it was decent or better -- mostly better.  The only reason I'd consider giving Bayside Buffet three stars is the service. We had a pile of plates on our table, and it took quite awhile to have them taken away from us. Maybe buffets ought to just have an area where you can bring your dirty plate up and set it? Just a common sense, easy solution thought. And how about a drink buffet so we can fill our own drinks? It took a good while just to get a refill of my water.  Anyway, I was pleased with this buffet and left satisfied. It was a little better than I anticipated, and I'd go back.",

We inhaled eggs, copious amounts of bacon, sausage, fruit, and crab legs. Who knew you could get unlimited crab legs for $25?   Was all of the food amazing?

It was about $9 cheaper than going to Bellagio buffet which is not much difference and we were about to go there but thought we'd save the time and stay at Mandalay.   The food was nowhere near even fair.  Snow crab legs were dry, probably leftovers from lunch.  I asked a server about it and he said to just get the legs from the bottom where it was submerged.  Those legs were soggy and unacceptable.  I tried to ask if they were going to bring out a new fresh batch and he said they are all the same.  Not very helpful and he didn't seem to care.   Tried other food and the sesame balls from the Chinese section were hard and stale too.  Almost like they were deep fried over again.  Hoped that dessert would be good and redeeming but it was also nothing to be excited about.  You only get so many opportunities to go out to eat with your friends and family, it's not worth wasting one of those limited days eating at a subpar buffet in Las Vegas.  Go to Bellagio or the higher rated buffets.    This day I won't get back.  At least I was with my family.",

Had it not been for those credits, we probably wouldn't have bothered going at all. With those credits, we went 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed. For it being the Mandalay Bay, I honestly expected a better buffet. Having read previous reviews though, I knew not to expect too much...and even then, it was still vastly underwhelming.   The first visit was during the dinner hour and, luckily, we got there before the rush (though, you wouldn't know it because it was still a madhouse). Best part? There was a couple who partook in the unlimited beer/wine thing they had, and the lady drunkenly HUGGED the dude behind the counter before exclaiming how drunk she was. Vegas at its finest. Worst part? The service. We probably had 4 plates on our table before our dude finally picked them up, we always had to ask for refills...and I'm not really sure why it's seemingly allowed to have children LAY on the floor in the middle of the walkways while their parents eat at a table. Maybe that's not a MB thing?  Second visit was during their champagne brunch buffet, and that was at least more worth it for me...if only because I took advantage of the cheap champagne and had several glasses with my cranberry juice. This visit had much better service than the first, which was surprising because it was WAY busier.  So again...had it not been for those credits, we wouldn't have bothered with the buffet. Especially if the lines were as long as they were during our stay there. Also? Don't eat the sushi...the one I picked up smelled like it was rotting.",

Basically just some soft serve and a couple little brownie bites.   The best thing about this buffet was Todd, our waiter who kept our drinks full and was super friendly.   I would skip this one, I much preferred Aria, Bellagio, & the Wynn over this one. Don't waste your walk down there.",

    "text": "Friends from out of town who were staying at The Hotel asked me to join them for dinner at the Bayside Buffet.  I had been here once before many years ago, and I remembered it as being a good, solid place.  It's pretty much the same now.  Among some of the things I tires, the Chinese broccoli with lots of garlic was outstanding.  The BBQ chicken pizza was good, too.  The prime rib was standard and was much of the other things I tried from the buffet.  There were no gourmet dishes but there was nothing that was bad.  They have free wine and beer with dinner which may be a plus for some people.  One of my friends did not care for the wine she got but she and her husband were pleased with the buffet also,  I think the place it was lacking was at the dessert area.  I ended up with two chocolate cakes and a raspberry cake.  The two raspberry and square chocolate cakes were OK but the chocolate cake cut like a pie wedge was outstanding!  It was quite rich--almost decadent.  I'd recommend this place for someone who's staying at Mandalay Bay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  There are better buffet options available on the Strip but at a few dollars more for the most part.",

The ones that I enjoyed and went back for seconds were the marinated steak, prime rib, osso bucco and the oxtail stew. I was in a meat coma afterwards. I also enjoyed their collard greens and steamed veggie mix of squash/carrots/broccoli - had to make sure I ate my veggies too. I generally don't have a sweet tooth but I decided to indulge of some of their dessert treats since we were on vacation anyway. I tried and enjoyed a bit of their bread pudding, classic cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake, berry cobbler, and apple pie ala mode. Man was I over my daily caloric intake for the day! Hahaha. We also had coffee, hot tea, and pineapple juice (not always available so bonus that they had it). Service was decent although she did forget the juices initially. Would consider coming back here especially if staying here at the resort.",

    "text": "I'm about to go on a Vegas binge sometime soon, this review was supposed to come earlier but I've been busy this whole year! Anyways, I digress, here are some quick tips:  1. At time of writing, Bayside Buffet does still have discounts through MyVegas the facebook/iphone app.   2. Strategic timing is key. If you come at 10:45 AM for Breakfast M-F, you can get in for $17.99 and then stay for lunch when it's bumped up to $21.99. This is just common Vegas buffet savvy though! However, this DOES NOT work for dinner as it does start at 4:30 PM regardless of the day.  3. Brunch begins at 7:00-2:30 on Saturdays/Sundays.   We rolled in on a lazy Saturday afternoon around 1:00 PM towards the tail end of brunch. We knew that there might be a lot of people waiting to get in, but we weren't prepared to see that the line was pretty much completely empty. Regardless, we walked up presented our MyVegas discount to get in for 2 for 1 without problems, and then walked up to the buffet.  I remember around twelve years back heading to the Bayside for the best crab and the best desserts on the strip. A lot has changed for the worse. It seemed as though almost everything that we had was either lukewarm or cold. Even things that were supposed to be under heat lamps were still cold!  Still, being hungry, we decided to sample what they had to offer. I picked up various pieces of meat from the grill, some italian dishes, and tried their sushi. One of the things I figured out quickly was their was really low quality and the steaks that they had were mostly tasteless and full of gristle.  Furthermore, the pasta sauces were watered down and the sushi was a complete utter joke. Then again, sushi at Vegas buffets are usually not really top notch at all, but this was just seaweed covered disgusting, cold, and hard rice.  The dessert section was not any better. Most of the stuff was melting and leftover chocolate streaks from stuff already taken by other guests was all over the plates. Most places at least replace the plates that food was taken off of.  Anyways, what upset my girlfriend and I the most was one particular dish. There was a baked rolled up piece of salmon that seemed like it was going to be hot. As I cut into it and opened it up, I discovered that the inside seemed to be raw. Note, this was not some sort of fancy salmon tartar or salmon sashimi, this was supposed to be a baked piece of salmon that was fully cooked.   Anyways, I notified the waiter who promised to talk to the chef. I watched this interaction to see what would happen. The chef talked with the waiter, looked at the fish, set it down, and went back to laughing and talking to another coworker. The waiter came back and told me that the chef said it was cooked, but when I asked for the waiter's opinion he told me he wouldn't have eaten it because it looked raw.   At this point, I asked for a manager. I couldn't believe that the chef would be so careless with his guests. If he truly believed that the fish was cooked, then he should have come back and served that piece of fish to me. Instead, he didn't even come to hear my feedback or anything. Anyways, the manager chewed out the chef, took note that really almost everything was cold, and also comped our meal. So props to the manager who deserves 5 stars, but the rest of the buffet deserves 0 stars.  I would not come back to the Bayside Buffet, but perhaps your experience will be better! Best of luck to you all! :)",

    "text": "For the price, the breakfast buffet they offer is one of the better in Vegas.  While not as thematically defined as the Paris buffet or as grand as the Bellagio buffet, the selection and quality are both great.  The Bayside boasts the seemingly obligatory omelet station, along with a bank of trays with fresh pastries, a pair of cold bars (with cheeses and smoked salmon) and a pair of hot bars (with eggs, sausage, bacon, starches and warm syrups).  These various offerings are spread across the dining area, which makes foot traffic throughout fairly light and organized.  I liked the decor in there too, with lots of natural light bubbling in and washing over the pleasant and comfortable tables.  Overall, a very solid breakfast, and one I'd be willing to repeat when I'm next in town.",

Reason #2: Pretty much the same food during dinner as lunch, so you'll get sick of it. Reason #3: You'll be \"drinking\" so much during that day that by dinner time, I don't think you would want to stuff your face with the same food to get your money's worth.  Food was alright. I remember crab legs, turkey, ham, steak for lunch and rotated during dinner time too. A variety of other food, but nothing was very memorable except the omelet station (selection of ingredients and made fresh to order). I normally judge a buffet by desserts and for lunch they still had Halloween decorated desserts probably from the day before. By dinner time, desserts were pretty much the same with a few switched out and replaced. They do have a soft serve ice cream machine with sugar cones, chocolate and vanilla custard (?). The white chocolate cranberry cookies were good though.  P.S. They had free champagne when I went and with a glass of orange juice, you get mimosas with your lunch! =)",

It did have some good like the pizza, cold shrimp and bbq ribs.  The bad was the crab, tough and desserts were so boring and bland.  The only stand out was the tiramisu.  I did like that they have self pay machines, a quick swipe of your credit card and you're on your way... Also the service was nice and on point.  Sadly I can't say I'd ever come here again.",

    "text": "For $30 a person, I was sorely disappointed. First, I was lame and thought I could use my \"Mlife\" card for the buffet but was told that my card was too lowly for that privilege (the sign only said \"Mlife\" with no reference to color. I was brutally rebuffed by the cashier and sent back to join the other lowlifes in the other line after paying in her line). Never the less we resolved to keep our tradition of trying the buffet of the hotel we stay at. Then we were charged for my son who should have been free. I had to get back in line to dispute it with the cashier who insisted that he was not free. When the other cashier notified her that she was wrong, I had to wait for a manager to receive a refund. The layout was a bit confusing. There were stations on opposite sides of the restaurant. My husband asked if I missed \"the other section\" which I had. I asked him if he knew they had a \"dessert section\" which he did not. The assortment of food was ordinary. I've paid less at the Red Rock and got a better variety and quality of food. I tried the crab leg even though I don't ordinarily eat it. I guess I had to feel like I ate my money's worth since there wasn't anything else there that was spectacular. Eggs were runny, waffles were deflated, bacon was soggy, danishes were like cardboard. I struggled with the crab legs and received fishy fingers and hardly any meat for my trouble. My son and daughter had only cereal (little boxes of Fruit Loops and Lucky Charms) and potato hash brown patty. They didn't care for anything else. The scrambled egg had onions in them so they stayed away from that. The bacon was all fat so it freaked them out. After finishing one little box each, they asked for a second one. I went back to find them seconds of their cereals, but there was only Corn Flakes and Raisin Bran. I asked the woman working in the section if there were more. She replied, \"Eh?!\" like she was about to kick my ass for disrupting her. I asked again and she replies a little too loudly, \"Lemme check.\" Then she threw out the box of cereals, searched for any that were different from Corn Flakes or Raisin Bran, then said,\" No, thas all I got.\" So we paid $22 for my daughter to have one box of cereal and a hash brown patty. At least my son ended up being free. Oh and the coffee!! Way way way too strong. At least I could dilute it with creamer. My husband, who takes his black with sugar, went to Starbucks afterward. Mediocre service. I will not be coming to this buffet again. I now can see why there was no line when we went in even though it was after 11:00 a.m. on a Saturday on Memorial weekend. Usually we have to arrive early to beat buffet crowds.",

She was attentive throughout my entire meal, always replacing empty water glasses or juice glasses.   My favorite items included: Mashed Potatoes-people aren't kidding. They're buttery and delicious and whipped to perfection! Fried Chicken-the skin was crunchy and the meat was tender and fell off the bone. Perfect. Desserts-I had a few tartlets that were all wonderful, as well as the fruit cobbler. Didn't try the cakes, but they certainly looked delish! Fruit selection-fresh, juicy, and hit the spot! Pizza-it certainly wasn't CPK but it wasn't gross either.  Very suitable for a buffet. Potatoes Au Grautin-practically licked the plate after these.  Everything else was so-so, except for the pancakes which I will actually lable as gross and inedible.  Certainly would not mind returning next time I'm staying in Mandalay Bay!",

Best part is that we paid breakfast price ;)  Breakfast is $15.99, kids are $12.99, 4 & under eat free.  For dinner it's $26.99... yeah, that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars, it's too expensive compared to other buffet joints for dinner.  But if you don't want to venture too far, and looking for a good meal, this place will do.  Plus, the view was beautiful, nice clear big windows as if the windows are wide open.  Service was good, except they don't have lactose milk.  Cheers!",

You could tell the food had been sitting for awhile bc certain ones that had sauces had this film on the surface. The food stations/areas were not well maintained, lots of splatters and drips that weren't cleaned.   There was a pasta bar that I never got to try bc no one ever came to assist me or anyone else standing in line waiting.   Our dishes started to pile up so badly that we had to use another table to stack them on bc our waiter was no where to be found.   Definitely not worth the $24 for dinner - crappy service and food and it wasn't even a busy night; it was 5pm on a Wednesday?!",

Yeah, don't expect that when you come here.  It was more of a school cafeteria than a world-class buffet.  I'd rather have gone to to the Wynn, Bellagio, or Rio.",

I really only like breakfast buffets anyway..and there's only so much you can do with breakfast. As long as a place has good bacon, I'm sold. I think Bayside's spread was only slightly less impressive then Bellagio's breakfast spread (Bellagio has more varieties of smoked fish). One thing that ticked me off was when they started changing over to lunch at 10:30. 10:30! They couldn't wait at least til 10:50? Who wants meatballs and chicken quesidillas at 10:30?!",

I was sorely disappointed in both the service and the food.  The service: Did not check on us often. Did not refill juice (even when I asked!). Seemed to only come to the table to clear it when we went back for seconds and thirds.   The food: sad sad sad... I was unable to cut through my pancakes with a knife. They were very rubbery. It was a huge disappointment. Omelet bar was good but had less options than I remembered. I couldn't cut the steak with my butter knife and I finally flagged down a server who told me that they do not have steak knifes.   I do not feel like I got my money's worth and I was sad that I chose this to be my last meal of this trip. I would have said something to the manager on duty but he was eating and walking around...",

The kind cashier asked for our M Life card.  We had $5 off each adult buffet because of the card!  The ambience is very nice.  The food surprisingly tasty.  The lamb and beef roast are great.  You can even have your pasta cooked by a chef.  They have Asian, Mexican, etc. food.  They have fish, crab legs, salmon.  The sushi looked dry.  There was a roasted pig section.  Food is not perfect, but for the price we paid,  I was really expecting less.  The server for our table is really slow in cleaning up, which is why I rated this restaurant 4 stars.  Otherwise,  I highly recommend it if you're on a budget!",

Not intending to be be snarky or mean, but if the food quality is going to be this low, they truly should consider lowering the price even more. I've been here annually for about 6 years and over the last 3 years, each time I've been here (a) the quality of the food has gotten worse and (b) the service has gotten worse [i.e., even though it's a buffet, you still are dependent on the server to bring drinks while your food gets cold]. I've told myself over the last three years, \"I don't think I'll do this again.\" Today, I mean it and will stick to it.",

I would however take advantage of the bottomless champagne on the weekends. The servers are very good about topping off your glasses so you get your money's worth. I would recommend this buffet over a regular casino restaurant because it costs the same but you get more food.",

The quality of the prime rib was pretty good for a buffet place.  My favorite dish was their oxtail. YUM!  Crab legs were disappointingly thin and salty and borderline fresh.  The chocolate opera cake tasted better than expected.  I actually enjoyed the chocolate and vanilla mousse inside the moist cake topped with the chocolate ganache.  The cookies also tasted borderline stale.  Hence 4 stars for Bayside Buffet due to a couple of questionable items.",

And I have been to tons of buffets in and outside of Vegas.  I say that to say that we were pleasantly surprised by the Bayside Buffet at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  What a nice variety of food and the quality of the food was good. (How many places have beef oxtails on their buffet lines?  Not many unless you're in Jamaica or a place that specializes in Caribbean food.)  Everything was fresh and our servers took care of us and never let our glasses go lacking.  I've been to much more expensive buffets and I can't say that they had food that had the same quality or wait staff that took care of us better.  And the food was tasty and catered to a variety of tastes. (E.g., Chinese, Mexican, etc...)  Everything that we had was tasty and FRESH.  Did I say fresh?  Yes, because I think that with the volume of food served, buffet lines can get grimy after a certain amount of time and the food isn't refreshed as often as it should be.  Not here!  Not this time!  I still can't think of what my favorite food was that I tasted, but the oxtails, rice and crab legs stand out. (I know most of the buffets serve crab legs and shrimp, but theirs were very fresh tasting.)  I would definitely recommend this buffet based upon the quality and variety of the food, price and cleanliness.",

My DC and I ate pretty darn well here. Lots and lots of options, yet it wasn't overwhelming. I am not a salmon fanatic but I had 2 different kinds (smoked and panko-crusted) and both were probably the best things I ate. My pal gave big snaps for the tamales. Crab legs were yumm-o. Desserts are also quite plentiful and I only wish I had room to try more of them.   The buffet also includes unlimited beer, wine, and champagne. Nice touch.  I think the best thing about Bayside (aside from having the same name as the Saved By The Bell high school.....please know I am kidding....) was the service....plates were cleared lickity-split and everyone who worked here was smiling and pleasant. Service can really make or break a dining experience for me, and I am glad to say that Bayside's staff impressed me.   This was my first trip to Vegas in awhile and I did not try any other buffet during my visit, so I can't say how it compares to others.....but I'd certainly make a tent out of myself here again.",

But well worth it.  I can no longer recommend it. I found it hard to find anything worth tasting, other than the prime rib. Most dishes were dried out in the pans and slop around them where food had been dropped. We were here in the middle of the dinner service time, which wasn't that busy. Last time I was here, a glass of champagne was included in the high price of the meal. That's no longer True either. There is now is an added fee of $7.99 to have a flute of screw off cap champagne. I was very disappointed with the food for the price of the buffet. Sadly, I can no longer recommend the Mandalay Buffet to anyone.",

I had to wait to have meat carved for me, while I went to get fresh fruit (which I felt was the only good thing there) two employees were kissing behind the station, the pancakes were slightly rubbery (how can you mess up pancakes), the eggs tasted like they came out of a box and the serving line was dirty.

If they had the kiosk operating, the wait wouldn't be that long.   When we were seated, the waiter immediately requested our drinks and booked it to the crab legs since we basically went to the buffet just for them. The the endless crab legs hit the spot, specially with a side of melted butter! However the rest of the food were just okay. To summarize the rest of the selection is what you expect at a regular buffet.  However with unlimited champagne and wine can't really go wrong.

Mexican foods were ok. I'd come here again if I was only interested in prime rib and salad and I had kids with me, but for the price I'd probably go someplace else.  Flavor was ok. It is more of a family area, so expect that you might have crying babies around you. I'm not bothered by that since it was expected nor lowered my rating for it.  The deserts were ok. Nothing really blew my mind away about this place and I did read the other reviews before going, so I didn't have very high expectations to begin with.   I don't drink, but if you do, like the other review said, they have an open bar. So that might be worth it for you with the cost.   It would have been great if they had more sushi types to choose from, but what they had was very salty and fishy tasting, not at all what I am  used to from a real sushi place.",

    "text": "Bayside Buffet is no beuno, there are plenty of other better options for buffets in vegas, most of the selection is not that great, and the buffet for dinner was still like $30. I have had better buffets at that cheap price, I think the one thing that was good was the mash potatoes, and even boxed powder mashed potatoes are decent compared to Bayside. Actually I can't say just the mashed potatoes, I ate a bit more of the steamed vegetables which I don't think they could mess up on. Everything else was either too dry (like the fried chicken), too salty (hearty vegetable tomato soup), or just plain sucked (like the dessert). The prime rib was not seasoned or while it looked good, you can totally tell it was an old piece of meat by the taste of it. Even their ice cream machine was bad, the chocolate side wasn't even cold enough, it melted by the time I reached my table and I didn't even sit far from the ice cream machine.",

    "text": "So in Vegas I want to enjoy the delicious food and all the great buffets they have around there!!! Of course some people don't eat like I do, so I had to accomodate their eating habits... not just mine... Especially when buffets are $30+ every where you go!    I did not take advantage of the 24 hour buffet pass, which I will DEF do the next time I go to Vegas!! It is well worth it!!   I ate at Bayside Buffet this weekend... and I must say... it was just ok.  I enjoyed the selections, although I wish there was more flavor other then MSG in everything. After the first plate I was already feeling bloated and full.   I did however enjoy the prime rib, the beef stew dish they had, and the pasta creation I made with shrimp.    But the food was just not worth $29.99!! I'd eat at Ceasar's Palace or the Rio!! Or even the M that everyone was raving about!!",

I wouldn't expect any less of Mandalay Bay.  Bayside is slightly lower in price but the same vegas buffet staples are still there like crab legs which unfortunately were not warm and split open like other buffets prepare them. A bummer for my husband since he prefers them that way but a huge relief for me- I could ease my stresses of him from digging into this high cholesterol indulgence.   Note: A wonderful alternative to the busy buffets along the main area of the strip- we were seated right away.",

Fresh made to order omelets in the morning and of course, prime rib at night. The wait staff was very friendly and kept our table clear of dirty dishes. Pretty good variety of food to choose from but was surprised they didn't have my favorite french dressing for salads. Other than that, my only other complaint was the prime rib being extremely too rare for my taste. The quality of the food was fairly decent, and the ambiance was pleasant. Despite the negative reviews, I'd definitely come back when I'm in town, again.",

There is a deal to be had though if you do the all day buffet for $38 per person.  Breakfast is really nothing great, probably a low light of the buffet but lunch and dinner were much better.  Honestly if you focus on nothing but prime rib and crab legs you will definitely get your monies worth.  The service is good, the decor is fine and the food is fair.

The crab legs at dinner were great, they have king crab legs chilled and split and hot snow crab legs. I think that I ate more than $40 worth of crab legs. I noticed that seaweed salad is becoming more popular and showing up at Vegas buffets. That made me happy. My favorite dessert was the cheesecake. It was so light and creamy and I added strawberry sauce sauce from the toppings bar next to the soft serve. Perfection. Even my 5 year old ate her moneys worth here.",

The problem is the food itself is DISGUSTING! Bland, way under cooked, way over cooked nothing was just right or even tasted good. The desserts were sad, unless you love chocolate. Chocolate cake, chocolate raspberry, chocolate this or that. Can I get a berry tart or key lime? And the chocolate was gross.  How do you mess up chocolate??? The cookies however were delicious surprisingly enough.  They were super under staffed and even when our section was no longer busy our \"waitress\" did nothing. Constantly forgetting my drink (water), we had to ask for napkins 3 times and when the table behind us asked for something she came up to us letting us know they didn't have it.  We had piles of plates on our table from them not being cleaned up.  For what they're charging they should have decent food and better service. I will never go back or recommend to anyone. Go to the W or the Wynn. Stay away from this one.",
