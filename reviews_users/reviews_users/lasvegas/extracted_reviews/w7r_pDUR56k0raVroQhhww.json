The service was great, everyone there helps everyone which is different but nice because you can always get what you need and you get very well taken care of the whole time.  When we ordered it did take a while to get our food but because the wings were great we will still go back.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a more laid back sports bar style restaurant.  The wings are a MUST!!",

The bartender was friendly and attentive without being awkward and annoying. I would recommend this joint for happy hour.

What that means is the bartender caters to everyone playing poker machines while those who don't have to patiently wait. Part of the reason is because the owner encorages special treatment from those dropping hundreds away, but the other part is the server casting tip spells on the customer by random jibberish. Meanwhile, I stand thirsty. I hate to say 'hey bartender, beer please' but apparently after 5 mins of the bartender fawning over a jackpot winner, that's what you have to do. Great beers.

She walked by our table with no eye contact or any acknowledgement of us. Finally the bartender came over and talked to us. He said she only told him about one drink we ordered ( we ordered two drinks ) and that they were in the middle of a shift change. I said I understand that but it would have been nice to know that instead of being ignored. He apologized but it still took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. No shift change actually happened either. The same employees were still walking around. By the time we got our food, we were about to get up and walk out. I asked to speak to the manager who made everything right. He comped our whole meal, apologized and said he would be speaking to the employees. Other then this one isolated incident, I have never had an issue. I would still highly recommend this place. 24 beers on tap, decent prices, and great food. Hopefully the issues with the employees we encountered are fixed next time we visit.",

    "text": "Went there on a Sat. late afternoon about 5:30pm. Not crowded. Met some friends at the party table. 30 minutes later no one had taken even our drink order. Finally was able to wave over a waiter and ordered drinks and dinner together since we had a show to go to that evening. 45 minutes later dinner came and the orders for all of us were completely mixed up. No one got the right side order with their entrees. Wife's BLT must have been sitting for quite a while because it was cold. Two of the fish & chips orders must have been sitting with the BLT because the fish coating had gotten soggy. (People had come in after us and gone before us fed and watered). Have to say though  the food (ignoring the time it had sat before being served) was good, and was priced right. Good beer choices and prices. The manager was called so we could vent to him, but he never came, but he did take 15% off the bill. I would have given them 5 stars if the waiters had been more attentive and the food had not sat so long before being served. The wait staff seemed very busy doing nothing in particular - just running to a n fro.  (These waiters want $15.00/hour? Oh please!) Hopefully, we were there on a VERY bad night. They do deserve a second try, which we will do in the near future.  OK, so I said I would give this place another chance. Our first visit was only rated as a 2 star. On this visit our experience was 180 degrees opposite. It was great and was what all pubs should be. We were seated in a booth immediately upon entering. Within 8 minutes our beer order was taken and we were drinking. (It was 2 for one night). Our food orders were taken just after the drinks were served and we had our food about 10 minutes after we ordered. Service was super! Our food was what we expected-tasted very good and was piping hot. We will visit again and try other menu items when we venture to Vegas again.",

The Kobe burger is a treat when you feel like paying $14 for a high-quality hamburger, and the rest of the burgers are interesting and tasty.  The appetizers are usually pretty good, but then again most bars serve some yummy deep-fried items.  There are about 25-30 beers available on tap, including one of my favorites, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar.  Steiner's isn't a place that I would consider driving across town for, but if you're nearby it's a good place for a meal and a couple of terrific beers.",

The hash browns O'Brien that come with just about all the breakfast dishes are great and not too greasy and the biscuits and gravy are nothing to sneeze at either.",

Probably the best thing about this place is that there is never a wait to sit down. Hmmm on second thought, maybe there's a reason for that. The food was ok. I think the menu descriptions make the items sound better than they actually are. Clever names too. But food seems to take a long time to come out. Also, my servers were always nice, but I had to wait a bit even to get the check. Nothing special. Typically what you expect out of a local bar/pub.  This place does seem like it's aging. I don't think that look and feel is completely intentional. I'll come back if the crowd I'm with wants to come here but probably not by my own intent.  Definitely give it a try once though.

Three things yelp friends:   1. Hands down the best chili I have ever had. Nabbed some off the old mans plate of a chili burger. Sweet, tomato tang and full beef flavor. One of those True staple foods way too god like to describe.   2. On bone lamb chops; I am used to Vegas buffets and churn n burn eateries throwing out \"high end fair\" for sub par prices and it is typically get what you pay for. This is different; under 12 bucks for 6 small lamb chops grilled extra rare and served with horse radish. Stop reading and order these. Seriously. Call ahead and order them.   3 horse radish sauce; the king of sauces as far as I see it. Beautiful in in balance of a brine and slight heart but no where near over powering. Perfectly seasoned for those aforementioned rare lamb chops. Even my heat and horse radish phobic girlfriend celebrated this.

The menu has a bunch of different Nevada cities associated with all of the different types of sandwiches and salads which is unique and pretty cool if you're into the history of Nevada or the history of states which I happen to be.   I got the burger and it was cooked to perfection - I got it with fries and one my friends got the lamb chops and everybody really liked the food, the servers are fast and efficient. The only bummer about this bar was that we were next to a couple people who were smoking an awful lot of cigarettes and that's not very much fun.",

A female waitress comes by and I tell her that we hadn't received the bloody mary. She gets on it and brings it to me herself. 50 minutes in: The food arrived with a guy named Paul (I Think). Burger and caesar salad were ok but definitely not worth $12+. We received chicken on the salad even though we didn't order it, but Paul sped off without asking a question.  1 hr and 15 minutes in: Elmer comes back out and we had to flag him down for the check and to go boxes. Took him 10 minutes to get back to us.  Mediocre food. Horrible service. Saw our waiter twice for less than one minute. Don't come here.   Oh! And as I was walking to my car after dinner, I saw Elmer just chillin' and socializing with his buddies in the back by the dumpster.",

Their \"craft\" beer on tap includes Blue Moon, New Belgium, etc. (I would call these import/premium). However, they have a decent selection of bottled craft beer (20 or so).",

    "text": "They call it a pub, and it's very much a sports bar.  Tons of televisions everywhere to catch the game of your choice.  A perfect spot to be when the big game is on!  My first time here, and I was going to give it a four stars.    I ordered the Chopped & Tossed Prime Ranch Steak Salad \"Pieces of chipotle marinated prime tender ranch steak tossed with roasted sweet corn, avocado, tomato, red onion and shaved fennel, served over field greens with our basil Romano vinaigrette, crispy fried sweet onions and Parmesan toast\" ($13.95) from their specials of the day menu.  Initially, our waiter told us that it was a lunch special but the chef would do it for us anyway since we came in the afternoon.  The salad looked great, huge and just totally worth it!  (I did notice the absence of the avocado though, which I pointed out later to the waiter so he knew.)    The Big F now the Husband ordered the Kobe (Not Bryant) Burger \"An incredible burger from beer fed, hand massaged, and sake brushed beef...served on a sweet sourdough bun with Maui onions, aged white cheddar cheese, heirloom tomatoes, and leaf lettuce.  Served with a pickle.\" ($13.99)  He was pretty impressed with his burger, a nice size and good flavor.    We also ordered the Death Valley, Chips \"Homemade crispy waffle cut potato chips tossed in Yosemite Sam Steiner's spicy seasoning blend of Lawry's seasoning salt and paprika.\" for $3.99.  A bit salty, but good nonetheless.  Service was spotty.  Our waiter disappeared for awhile and we wanted to pay.  We had to wave down another waiter who in turn looked for our waiter and you could tell our waiter 'disappeared' for a bit.  Did he go on break and not tell anyone?    When I got home shortly after, I was on the toilet.  Yeah, dinner didn't agree with me.  It wasn't pretty.  2 stars...overall, 3 stars.  Went back again the past weekend and this time I ordered the Sea Breeze, Mediterranean Steiner's Pub Salad \"A mound of crisp romaine greens topped with a dressing of marinated cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, jicama, and green peppers mixed into a balsamic and herb vinaigrette.  Presented with crisp pita chips, kalamata olives, and a sprinkle of feta cheese.  Served with your choice of our succulent lamb chops or a tender grilled chicken breast.\"  for $13.99.  I chose the lamb chops and three chops were resting on my salad.  Again, it was a hearty salad, and the chops were good (not as good at Blue Martini's though) and enough for the Husband to share.    He needed to share because he made the mistake of ordering the Wellington, Lamb Chops Appetizer \"Four chops marinated in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, then grilled to perfection.  Served with our signature horseradish dipping sauce.\" for $11.99.  And it really was four chops with a dipping sauce.  It definitely wasn't going to be enough for him.  He did ask the waiter if it came as a entree option, but was told only as an app.  So, as a result the Husband was eating off my salad.    Our friend ordered the Panaca, Corned Beef Reuben Sandwich \"100% lean and trimmed corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and your choice of stone ground mustard or 1000 island on grilled marble rye bread.\" for $8.99.  It came with fries, potato salad, coleslaw or chips.  Since he didn't know what the Death Valley chips were, the waiter offered to bring him a sample so he could try it first. (I thought that was pretty nice of the waiter to do that.)  And as a result, he chose the Death Valley chips.  Service was a lot better this time!  Not only did our waiter check on us often, but the waitress who initially got us our drinks was following up on us as well.  There was no need to even worry about getting our beverages refilled since they were on top of it!  They are also in the Entertainment Book, which gives you a 15% discount every time you dine there after you use the coupon.  3.5 stars overall.  Value priced apps M-F 3-5 pm 2 for 1 happy hour M-F 4-7 pm  They also have a Steiner's Pub card where you earn points when dining there.  (Pics posted!)",

I explained my dietary restrictions to our waiter and came up with an idea not on the menu: a chicken dinner plate.  Chicken breast was wonderful; moist, seasoned just right, steamed veggies and plain mashed potatoes.  Everything was delicious.  We arrived at Happy Hour and got 2 beers for the price of 1; you've got to love Foster's on tap!  My wife ordered their version of a French Dip sandwich.  She said it was a bit dry, but ordered it with the onion rings (for an additional charge).    Yummy rings.  Wait staff was wonderful.  At least 4 different servers were at our table at one time or the other making sure everything was good and bringing what we needed.  Merited a 20% tip on my \"very good service\" meter.  We will be back before the vacation is over.",

While staying in the area, we were looking for a good place for a quick bite & dropped into Steiners, nice place, great video screens, plenty of games playing. Lovely waitress, fast service, yummy chicken fingers & good meaty chilli, great selection of beers. I'd normally say 4 stars.....   but wait......   Later that day our group of 8 wanted to go out & do some 'partying' at dinner & dropped in just before 10pm.  When it took a while to get seated, we poked around because the guys were busy playing video games, we seated ourselves.  After sitting around 10 minutes we got our orders placed & waited & waited and finally ate 45 minutes later.  We were 'this close' to walking out, but we stuck it out.  The food was average, some cold, some ok, but very average. One of our meals didn't show up, I got up & went back to the kitchen to see what was up & they were just finishing it up.  Pretty pathetic for what is supposed to be a 24hr place.  Other members of our party would think I'm being very gracious & be much more critical than I.  We had the feeling this was a late night staff that didn't care about what has happening there. From this experience I can't imaging our coming back.  After the horribly slow service, they put an automatic 18% tip on....  ah ha.... that works two ways...NO INCENTIVE to provide decent service.   Very disappointing. Hopefully they will improve.",

The food was great- burgers, onion rings & buffalo chicken fingers all highly recommended. Breakfast was just what we were looking for-- a diner style menu with a twist. And mimosas heavy on the champagne for a cheap $5 each. Service could be slow and hard to come by a server but it's worth having patience. We'll probably be back again by weeks end!",

    "text": "So I still don't get this whole \"Nevada style pub\" crap and I've been here for over 8 years now, but if someone claims that one of said pubs has a great burger, I'm always up for the challenge. These pubs seem like every other generic, chain-looking venue that I've seen in every other state I've been to so I don't know what makes them \"Nevada styled\" but whatever. Anyway, today's pub in question is Steiner's, not really a spot that was on my radar for any reason until someone recently suggested it. And I must say, once again I was a bit surprised.  As I said earlier, the interior is pretty typical for a 'pub'; dark wood floors, dark wood tables, and a ton of neon beer signs. But I don't think you're ever going to one of these places for the ambiance. The menu has pretty much anything you can think of in the genre of American comfort food, and their website actually claims it is 'sophisticated' at that. Click the link for the full menu rundown as it's too much to list here. Speaking just about burgers, they offer a few great sounding choices mostly named after casinos on the strip. They all sound pretty good, and I'll potentially be going back to try a couple others.  This time around I decided to skip the casino themes and go with the Kobe burger: \"beer fed, hand massaged and sake brushed beef served on a sweet sourdough bun with Maui onions and aged white cheddar cheese, heirloom tomato and leaf lettuce.\" What came out looked somewhat unassuming, but tasted fantastic. The Kobe had terrific flavor and was cooked perfectly. The orange-colored heirloom tomato was a great touch; I only wish it was a tiny bit bigger so it could stand out more. The cheese was melted, a bit too subtle but good. The Maui onions were sweet and great, but a bit too much for me so I pulled them out halfway through. The bun was super dense, soft and delicious. Almost like a Hawaiian sweet roll and a sourdough had a baby. Overall this was a fantastic burger, and a total surprise.  The fries were good too. I didn't like the a-la-carte option or the $4.39 price tag, but you do get quite a lot for the price. Some slightly undercooked for my taste but good overall. What isn't good is that my burger, fries and drink came to $22.39 which is way too high for a single burger meal in a local's spot, even if it is a great burger. With a price point like that it's still tough to fight with the price of something like the Dispensary Lounge even if it is a damn good burger.",

The fries were battered fries and they were pretty good as well.",

I know, I was in the restaurant business for years and can tell frozen and canned from freshly made.   Steiners has a great pub vibe. I love it here. Their lunch and dinners are great.

When it came, it was closer to medium well.  When I pointed it out my server, she apologized and took it back.  The manager came over and also apologized.  They really appeared concerned that I didn't get what I ordered.  When I got the 2nd burger, it was perfect.  They also have a fantastic selection of beers both on tap and in bottles/cans.  Many are craft beers.  If I lived here, this would be one of my hangouts.  I can highly recommend this place to anyone.  PS: I added a picture of my burger.",

My check was $10.26, I gave her a $20 and got $9 in return, no change, so I Ieft the $0.74 she didn't give me as her tip, and that was more than she deserved. The food is always good, the service in this case, was poor to say the least. For the record. I looked around and other were getting refills, etc. and attended to.",

We went on Monday, so all of the burgers were marked down.  $6 for each specialty burger (plain and cheese were $5)!  Great deal...Think they also had a prime rib special that night as well, although we didn't try it.  As someone mentioned early, it is definitely a sports bar.  Tons of TVs all over the place and loads of games going.  Service was decent...Nothing to complain about on that front.  Overall a great place to catch a bite to eat and watch a game!",

Tv's all over so you can always see the game. Service was prompt, helpful and welcoming. And the food was absolutely out of this world. We got potato skins as an appetizer. Perfectly crisped edges, but with perfectly cooked baked potato textured middle, topped with freshly cooked chopped bacon, cheese and chives. We got a cup of the chili, which was as amazing on its own as it was added to the skins. Black beans & a healthy amount of bite size chopped steak in a smoky tomato base that most definitely has notes of BBQ sauce.  Good, crisp & chilled house salad with what tasted like a homemade blue cheese dressing. Finished with the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, with a requested side of au jus. Ample portion of perfectly tender meat. Don't be fooled by the strip mall exterior. Good food is to be had here!",

    "text": "Steiner's serves average pub food, but with a good selection of draft beers. The food alone would probably merit two stars, though a few dishes definitely are better.  The best food I've eaten at Steiner's is their meat loaf, which most of the time is exceptional served with good mashed potatoes and gravy. The worst I've had at Steiner's are the \"buffalo shrimp,\" which are little more than overcooked, battered medium-large shrimp.   The shrimp I was served were so overcooked, they had coiled tightly like tiny springs. Of course that made them almost unfit to eat.  Their chili is better than Winchell's or Village Pub, but the burgers at Steiner's are nowhere near as good as those at most Village locations, but slightly better than the ones at Winchell's.  I like the atmosphere at Steiner's, plus the daily specials. And that meat loaf keeps me going back.",

We didn't drink on this particular occasion, but after looking at their beer menu, they have good selection and I look forward to coming back and trying out some more of their food and drink options, especially the wings, soup and nachos... which looked great on other people's plates as I passed by on my way out.

We both ordered 22oz beers for pretty cheap, I think it was $5. I got a bacon cheeseburger with \"frizzled onions\" aka onion strings. The burger and the fries were delicious and I ate every last bite. We were very satisfied and highly recommend this place.",

I didn't have to get the jaws of life out to bite into it! Hubby had bratwurst on pretzel roll.  The staff was courteous and friendly. With a special shout out to Blue! He was our busboy and much more. He made sure we were comfortable, got our drinks, stopped by table once in awhile to make sure we had everything. Management! If you read these reviews, train that young man to be a waiter! I shook his hand leaving. He impressed us that much. Our waiter was also good, kudos to him as well.

But what I think that really stands out is the service.  The staff is super friendly and we never have to wait long to get served.  You can really feel the team spirit here.  The staff is always making sure your soda or other beverage is filled.  We had Ashley tonight.  She has a great smile and you can tell she loves her job! We always talk this place up.  I'd rather come here than some of those fancy places on the strip.  We certainly will be back time and again.  Thank you Steiner's!",

They were very attentive.   The only negative was that their was a football game on and the patrons were especially loud. No fault of the staff, but it did take away from the experience a bit. I would definitely recommend this restaurant/Pub.",

I was there this past Monday and ordered a margarita during happy hr time. Since in the past I got two for one, I asked the waiter why I wasn't getting two for one drinks, to what he brought the manager over and replied with such attitude that I did not appreciate, I even mentioned that on  website it says two for one drinks, his answer was rude. He said something like ok I will talk to the owner to get this fixed so you don't get confused, because by drinks it can mean many different kind of drinks,  it I'm telling margaritas is not part of happy hr.  I don't mind that margaritas are not happy hr the only thing that find upsetting is the lack of respect for for customers, specially the loyal ones.   I'm also leaving a picture of the bar where my friend and I sat and no one was courteous to come and clean up when I accidentally spilled the drink.",

This is actually a tavern, but hey have daily food specials - one of which includes a breakfast special.  $9.99 gets you 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 sausage links and 2 pancakes!  They also have pizza, sandwiches, wings and a number of other items.  It's a tavern, so you can always keep drinking adult beverages too (this is Las Vegas after all)!",

A friend of my cousin suggested to eat here via snapchat (should have known this was a bad idea). The yelp reviews gave it 4 stars. So my group called a cab and traveled halfway across the city to eat here and everyone was disappointed. All of us were STARVING and no one finished their food. Entrees we purchased included the Orleans chicken sandwich, pork sandwich, burger, and Philly cheesesteak. We all agreed that the cheesesteak was the best but it wasn't anything above average. Penn station has cheesesteak that is just as good and they are fast food. Furthermore, our waiter wasn't attentive at all. Not a single drink refill and we had to flag him down for silverware, mayo and to go boxes (which lets be honest, we aren't eating these leftovers.)   Moral: don't eat at Steiners",

Usually when we sit down in the dining area it takes a while before we are even acknowledged us whether slow or busy (this past summer I even walked out after waiting ~15 minutes).  Once they start helping us they are very freindly and pretty good but getting to that point is always a relatively long wait.  I we sit at the bar service I totally on the ball.  Now steiners has a GREAT beer selection and very good bar food.  So, basically the only reason I gave them 3 star is the long wait I always seem to have when I first come in here.",

I did go here though the other night and had really disappointing service, hence the 4 stars rather than 5.  We had to find our own waiter, wait for quite awhile and finally were served on and off by two people.  The male was very obviously under the influence of something, he was totally unprofessional, spacey, and nervous.  He even broke a plate by accident.  It was a very uncomfortable experience and I am surprised he is even still employed there.  Our server was nice enough, but seemed careless and rushed.  We came just for dinner late, maybe midnight, otherwise my visits have been during the day and the restaurant/bar is always a pleasure and somewhere I would visit again.",

Located a few miles south of the strip, it has restored our faith in finding great, reasonably priced food in this hit and miss town. Even better, it is open 24/7 catering to night owls! The decor is reminiscent of an old hunting lodge invaded by a casino/sports bar. The clientele is a mix of locals and tourists, and surprise surprise, no one under 21 allowed, making Steiner's a kid-free zone, so take note weary parents!! Treat yourself to a sitter! The wait staff were warm and friendly without losing any of their efficiency. When they weren't serving they were cleaning, the place is immaculate!! Finally the food; as San Franciscans, we have pretty high standards, and we were astonished to find such high quality cuisine in such an out of the way place!! Simple wholesome American fare, with surprising twists of sophistication. Steiner's is well worth the cab ride!!!",

Their menu has a lot of variety and during happy hour the prices for apps are good. Those I think they need to make their nachos bigger in some way. There is literally like 12 nachos. They are delicious though no doubt.   Beer selection is also fabulously wide. They had Kronenbourg 1664, which is my favorite when I am not going cheap beer like ultra and bud light. I love when places carry this because it makes me happy to see it.   The service is also one of the best. Jessica is on top of things as a bartender and so is...I want to say Shana but the cute blonde with glasses is the best description I have. She is fun to talk to and is also on top of it.   One thing I do not like, is the fact that 25cent gambling is actually 50cents, but one day when I win there it will pay out more. I just like taking my time with keno, making my 20bucks last. :)   Overall, this place is awesome. I love their menu names for things and their many neon signs.",

Had a shot of fireball as well, which was really cheap but I can't remember exactly how much. Their fries are delicious too. I had a burger, I don't remember the name of it. It was cooked to perfection! It had poblano chilis, avocado and frizzled onions and I loved every second of it. I wish I could have one right now. The staff is more than friendly & quick to take care of whatever needs you may have. They were all very knowledgeable about the menu/drinks and very helpful overall. They let us sit where we wanted to, so we took the huge 10 person booth right at the front. I just got back from Vegas this week, but I am ready to go there again JUST for this pub.",

But this review is to focus on one of the bartenders, Jessica she's so HORRIBLE!!!! She's so rude ! If she doesn't know you she is just a complete B&$%# I couldn't believe the service and attitude. And is not the first time. Usually I don't pay much attention to it. But I think people should know if you come to the bar area and Jessica is working ( the girl with short blond hair) just get up turn around and go home. You'll get better service anywhere else. She never checks if you need a refill, she makes horrible drinks! Get a beer if you decide to stay she can't mess that up. But then again is Jessica. I wouldn't recommend staying to have a drink when she's at the bar. Any other day not bad at all.",

They have a ton of beers (like 50) and plenty on tap. Even Dead Guy Ale from Rogue l, which is our favorite!  Also the food is great bar food!! The flat bread pizzas were amazing and the fries were super crispy and hand cut and beer battered but super light! Then we got to chat with the manager Manny and he is super personable and cool. What a great spots bar with tons of tv's and some machines at the bar. So all is all a good stop!!  And if you stay at the Oasis you get a 15% discount.",

I came here on Christmas Eve and Christmas around 11pm then 1am, respectively. We got nachos, wings, burgers, and 4 pickle backs... all coming with fries and costing $52. Couldn't get any better than that! The other day we also tried a lot of drinks as well as the fish and chips and calamari, all quite tasty for late nights :)  Nachos - they were tasty and super packed with stuff. It was really interesting cause they were laid out one by one on a plate, each with stuff laid on top. I've never had such carefully places chips lool  Burger - A standard burger, but whooo can complain about such a large burger with all the elements and a side of bomb fries? For only $6 or so?  Wings - Same goes to these, so cheap with maybe 10 or so wings and a side of awesome fries!! Free ranch and blue cheese dressing too   Fish and Chips - I don't have to go off about fries again but the fish was super tender, came with three large pieces   Calamari - Standard Calamari  All in all, a great place to grab late night munchies, drinks, and chill with friends :)",

Steiner's is at the corner of Blue Diamond and Las Vegas Blvd. Close to the Strip but far enough away that the prices are reasonable and it's mainly locals.    Their menu is large and they have a large variety of different sandwiches both hot and cold. I settled with a Reuben on toasted marbled rye and couldn't have been happier. The meat was tender and flavorful and very filling. The potato salad was just OK (a bit on the salty side). Our waitress said they don't make it in house. My friend got the club sandwich on rye which was HUGE. It was so massive that he took half to go. We opted to just stick with soda instead of drinking but this looks like a cool place to have some cocktails and play video poker.",

The marbled rye bread was a good diversion too.  Our Stone IPA and Firegrita (fire wiskey in margarita mix) hit the spot too.  It was amusing to see two tappers coming up from the middle of a high table in the main seating area just off the bar. Waitress said it has been inop (dry) for well over a year but most likely gets handled by drunks on a regular basis. haha.  Good service during what appeared to be a slow dinner hour.  Pub style atmosphere. There are many comical signs hanging on back bar, walls, and columns that may make you chuckle a bit. Almost any seat has some sort of TV in view.  Try them out.

They're much more patient than others), -but that doesn't mean you should take forever to order.   The drinks are a larger size than most places I've been to, with reasonable prices, which keeps me coming back.   The food is actually a larger portion than I'm used To getting, but this pub does great with that. I tried their fish and chips as well as their fish tacos and both are actually really good! Great late night food! **if you want an appetizer to share, go for the pretzel with dipping sauces. It's HUGE. Very easy to share with friends. (There were 5 of us, and we didn't end up finishing it because we also ordered entrees). Can't go wrong with this pub!",

They have a few locations in town and this one sits a few miles south of the strip on LV Boulevard.   They definitely went for mining/ore cart theme as a throwback to Nevada's history. Pictures of gold panhandlers, picks and axes adorn the walls. The menu was pretty standard bar fare: cold and hot sandwiches, burgers, salads, and a few specialties. My club sandwich was great, perfect amounts of meat and bread and they subbed out the ham for extra turkey. I love the fact that Steiner's serves up beer battered fries instead of the soggy/salty spuds you get at other places. They had a nice twist on the nachos as well:  about a dozen large tortilla chips each individually built, topped with beans, cheese, and all the other fixings you could want.  Service was pretty standard, our server came by regularly with refills and condiments, no chit chat, straight to the point. The bar gets big props for having a large craft beer selection. The beer menu is extensive, with many small and local microbreweries featured alongside with the standard domestics. Prices were reasonable, and happy hour means you can knock off a buck or two depending on what you get.",

Of course the yankee redsox game was blacked out but you can't blame that on the bar right?  With decent price game specials, breakfast served till noon, and well cooked hash browns, how can you go wrong.    Best thing is, they manage to avoid the smokey scent most of the other bar/video poker/sports places seem to have.    The breakfast sandwich was really good and the avocado surprisingly fresh.  Service was mixed as we had 3 people asking us where we wanted to sit and which menu we wanted and then waited a good 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order and the place was mostly empty.  But once we ordered the food came out quickly and was well prepared.",

We've been going there for years and they always remember us, they always go above and beyond and best of all the food is excellent. It frankly tastes too good for a bar. Their steaks are well seasoned, they charbroil their burgers and the fries are delicious. I even really enjoy their creme brulee.   You can't go wrong on the menu. Great place to enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner and even better place to take in a game. I've eaten there maybe 50 times! So take my word for it. If its your first time there, try their steaks or burgers first.",

If only they have a Steiner's in California then I would love to go eat here often.  Prices are decent and great proportion too.   This place is a pub/bar/restaurant.    Service:  Service here is very nice and friendly.  Waitor and waitress always come by to check up on us once in a while to see how the food are etc and I think that is really kind of them to care about their customers.    Hot wings: I think they have the best hotwings there.  Their wings are big and juicy and very flavorful.  Bigger than Wings Stop's wings and KFC.  The wings comes with seasoned fries and they're really good.  Ranch, Celery, and carrots on the side for your veggies.  You can add a side of extra hot sauce if you like to eat it with more flavor, but yea I am missing those wings right now!     We had also ordered one of their burgers but I can't recall its name but it was very delicicious too.  All their burgers are named after a hotel from the las vegas strip area :) .   Their Chinese chicken oriental chicken salad was awesome too.    Before we left LV to head back home, we ate here one last time for breakfast and another order of hotwings to munch on.    Overall, we really enjoyed eating here for great food, good service, good price, and yummie wings.  We will return the next trip to Vegas.

It is quite loud during that time if you're sitting at the bar. The bartenders are very mindful of their usuals & even the newbies when someone needs a drink or a refill. We ended up moving from the bar to a booth due to it being too loud. We ordered an nachos as an app. When asked how big the nachos were, the server replied w/ 12 nachos. We both repeated back, '12 nachos?!?', 'yes 12 nachos'. Sure enough when they arrived there were 12 nachos each w/ all the toppings on them, sauces of sour cream, guc, & salsa in ramikans in the center. Def not worth the price for just 12 nachos, plus it took the fun out of eating them since we couldnt pick or pull chips apart. The server was very tentative to our requests & needs. Drinks were right on par. Naturally due to the game it was packed. The only other bummer is that they do not have a patio as it sits in a strip mall parking lot.   We ended up coming back here 2 nights later & it was like night & day from the last time we were there. Less people were in the bar, but same amount of staff, yet it took longer to get a drink at the bar than 2 nights prior & it was busier. We ended up moving back to the same booth we were at 2 nights prior & no one came to tend to us until about 30 minutes of us sitting down. Guess you have to sit at the bar to get the proper attention.",

She was nice and helped us (though we had to ask for something three times). We even had an alcoholic drink, but was not given any better service. She was busy, but she attended the bar more than her tables. I don't blame her, but it was frustrating as a table customer.   The food was good. The burger was amazing! The daiquiri was good and the Dr. Pepper was good.   It was too expensive though. $60 for two burgers, one thing of fries (burger alone was $20) one daiquiri and and one coke. The food was good, but not that good.   Between the service and the price, we will not be back. The food was the only thing that saved it. Maybe going on a non-game night would be better if you want to try it. Just be prepared for a little extra price.",

My sister and I decided to go to lunch and after driving around, seeing nothing particularly eye catching, we ended up at Steiner's.   Walking in, my sister said it smelled bad. It smelled kinda funky. It was also extremely dark in there, which makes me weary of sanitation. We seated ourselves and were handed menus. The menu is basically cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, chicken sandwiches and burgers, with a page of expensive salads and dinner and breakfast foods that we were either too early or too late to order.   I settled on the French dip and fries for $8 and my sister got the BLT. We both got the beer battered fries, which were decent. My French dip was too bland and not good. The au jus tasted like it was filled with MSG. My sister said she liked her sandwich but said that it wasn't worth the price.   We had to wait a long time for our server to ask us if we wanted to order so that was eh. Also, a waitress was carrying a huge trashcan/paint bucket/ice container(?) thing through the dining room on her way to the drink station attached to the bar. That was kinda bizarre because I've never seen a waitress carry supplies through a dining room at any other restaurant. They definitely need to go through the kitchen, even if walking through the dining room is faster.   I probably won't be back, but it was nice to get out of the house.",

Pros were that they have an extensive diner like menu with anything you can think of. We ordered the Philly cheese steak and fries and it was cheesy and juicy so 5 stars on that. The roast beef cold sandwich wasn't bad but it wasn't the best. The roast beef was a bit dry with some inedible pieces. The ranch was really watered down so I would skip that too.  Cons were that it smells like stale cigarettes because smoking is allowed inside. Also some of the tables have a really strong rusty metal smell so avoid the metal table tops. We ended up moving so it wasn't a big deal.   Overall this was a pretty good priced quick meal stop and I would recommend this as a place for good drinks and food.",

The decor in the bar is very distracting but oh so appealing. Great eye candy. The bar is so very well stocked with all sorts of delicious flavors of alcohol and liquors to mix together to make wonderful spirits. We decided to sit at the bar and did have to wait just a few minutes for the bartender to come over to us.  The bartender did give me the universal nod stating that he say me and will be over as soon as he was free. Being on that we were on a beer kick already we opted to stay with the same type of alcohol. I ordered a Coors Light when the by bartender get a free moment, and my sister had Budweiser. We sat and talked for a long while there. There seems to be no pressure just sitting here enjoying a cold beer and great conservation.",

They were grilled to perfection and so juicy. We would have ordered more, but was kind of expensive at $15 for 4 chops.   We decided to get a chicken sandwich and breakfast option to share. Ordered the Santa Chicken sandwich. Loved it. The chicken was juicy, loved the hint of spicy and the bread of soft and delicious. Love the side of fries. It didn't even need ketchup. It was yummy.   We also ordered the ham steak with scrambled eggs and ghost pepper cheese and hash browns. It was good as well. We ended up taking that home with us and eat it the next day.   I highly recommend the spot. It had a good number of people there at 2 in the morning.",

    "text": "So... I've been here a couple times now. First for just drinks with friends who we were visiting. They love this place and frequent it all the time. My boyfriend and they all say they love the place for its beers and great food but on my last day in town that was not what I experienced.  We decided to get our last bite to eat in town before hitting the road since we were staying right across the street. Sad we just missed breakfast:( so instead I ordered their Friday special hot valley Thai salad with shrimp. (Shrimp were perfectly cooked & seasoned) and I was eager to enjoy the rest of it, I even took a pic because it looked soooo good..but I could not eat more than two bites without my mouth scorching on fire as my face turned bright red!! No where on the menu did it mention it had those thin red and green super spicy chilis chopped up in there WITH THE SEEDS! My mouth was on fire! U can't serve raw chopped chilis with seeds in a salad. What if an elderly person ordered the dish took a bite choked and died?!? I'm not even kidding! people have sued and won for careless little things like that. Regardless, It was impossible to pick all those peppers out. Even after taking a bite of my boyfriends sandwich (since I couldn't eat my salad) he said the heat from my mouth must have got on his sandwich because his next bite was so spicy! Lol (the BLT was pretty good btw!) and we can handle spice but this was just unbearable. The dressing was not the best pair either, chili lime vinaigrette? Too soy-vinegary.. maybe a creamy cilantro lime ranch with the chilies incorporated would be better, but even ranch didn't help cut the heat.   I know it's just a salad but it was one of the first and only plates I've ever had to send back. And it's not just about a flop order, or menu misprint...  But the overall dining experience.   Our waitress was great, excellent service on her part. Yes, she promptly came back and politely said she would comp the plate , asked if I wanted anything else, (no we had to hit the road) and she was friendly!  The manager however, who we noticed walking around talking to his regulars and players at the tables not far from us, did not even have the respect for his establishment to address or acknowledge a comment or concern from a paying customer who could possibly become a regular in the future! Our friend who was paying for the meal is also a restaurant manager and he was very upset at how this manager handled my experience. Which is why I had to turn to yelp. At least come by when you walk RIGHT past us with a simple \"oh you didn't like it? Sorry\" nothing! At best a manager would offer to replace the meal, as their customer would like it, with no cost.  But he probably just grumbled to himself and assumed I was being a nuisance.  Not the case sir, maybe you were having a bad day but I hope you step up your customer service and treat all your guests hospitably, not just those who are throwing money into your table games. Disappointed :(",

The lamb chops comes with 4 pieces for 9 bucks - not cooked perfectly but def not overdone so def good for the value.   This place was packed on a Thu night but don't think it's an ideal spot to watch games- tvs were small and we came to watch an Okc/Mia game about as premier matchup as you can get and it was only on maybe 1/4 of the tvs with no volume.  Most tables I observed were talking, eating, drinking.  Overall the food and drink specials were good coupled with the alcohol breath test machine by the bathroom!  But I'd still probably head towards town square to hit up yard house or other places for beer and food.  It's a decent spot to check out.",

The bartender was very nice and helpfully.  So much so that I came back with my Wife the next night.   Again two very nice lady bartenders.  We did our part for the Vegas economy.  Dropped a couple hundred in the video poker and had a few beers.   My only issue was the \"Special Guinness Cheese sauce \" that goes with the Giant Soft Pretzel.    Not sure if it had gone bad or what but I literally spit my food into a napkin.    We will come back next time we are in town but I am a little scared about the food.",

I can understand if someone has a rough day once in a while so maybe I can excuse that. She seemed disappointed each time she tried to up-sell us and we said no. Hmmm... Lower bill total = lower tip perhaps? I wish I would have caught her name so as to be helpful. For some reason there was a gal named Meghan (sorry if I am spelling that wrong) who seemed to be picking up our server's slack. Finally, there was a group of folks who where playing a video game who were very loud and we could hear them half way across the restaurant. Ok, fine. Yet the vulgarities coming from their mouths! Oh my! Someone needed to shut that down. Or maybe they were playing a \"Who Can Yell \"Mother Effer\" the Loudest\" game? Either way, not cool.",

The lamb chop  were one of the most best things I ever ate. They literally melt in your mouth and the sauce is just phenomenal. Every other time I've ate there anything I've ordered was always on point and great. I am now stuck on the Mediterranean salad with the lamb chops. Everyone has a smile on their face when you walk in and the service is always great. Even my girlfriend that went to another Steiners and had a  bad incident with one of the servers, so she was boycotting. I had some leftovers and she ate it and loved it. She said last night we will definitely have to order this again, after saying she would never eat at another Steiners  ever again. I highly recommend this place the menu is full of everything. You really almost don't even know what to order because there's so much on it.",

Atmosphere is laid back, seat yourself, dark pub. One thing I learned this time was they have no kids seats. And really no Kids menu. (though you can order them a grill cheese or quesadilla for $4.99) Losing some stars there.   I had the Kobe Burger, which was delicious. Big, Juicy, with some Maui onion, aged cheddar and heirloom tomato. Though for $13.99 they could throw in some fries. My wife had a Reuben sandwich which she liked.   Beer list is good, not great. I did have a Rouge hazelnut brown 22oz. for $5.75 off draft, so not bad there.   All in all the food and atmosphere, meet expectations for a standard pub.

Most recently I went to Steiners with my husband on a Friday night because we had a coupon in our 2011 Entertainment coupon book. BoGo. Not too shabby since we love Steiners.   The place was not very busy and we were able to sit right away. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. My husband was thrilled because he got to watch sports while we waited.   We started out with a couple of Blue Moons and an order of Onion Rings. GET THE ONION RINGS. Yum, drool. Unless of course you are on a diet. Then maybe not. In fact, don't. But luckily it was Friday after 5pm and all calories from Friday at 5pm to Sunday at midnight don't count so we were OK. If it were not for our tight budget, we would have ordered another round of Moons and Rings.   For dinner I had the Kobe Beef Burger and my husband had the Fish n Chips. The burger was fresh, full of flavor and cooked to order. The Fish n Chips were cooked to perfection and we were both happy campers.   Overall we are never disappointed by Steiner's. Every time we come I leave thinking, why don't we come here more often?   If you're looking for an after work or weekend beer and pub style food, Steiner's is your place!",

    "text": "Steiner's, a Nevada Style Pub on LVBs is one of those places that I don't quite know how to describe. It is a sports bar, Irish feel pub, and restaurant all in one. From what I see they seem to be pulling it all off with good beer, plenty of sports on screens all over the place, and good food.  My wife and I come there most often for breakfast which they do pretty well. They are not the \"Egg and I\" (yay) nor the \"Hash House A Go Go\" (yuck) but a happy medium. I usually get the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs which they do well and of course there is your usual Two Egg Breakfast that is done well and reasonably priced. (It is hard to review breakfast food; it's hard to screw up breakfast.) The hash browns are good with red and green bell peppers for added flavor and interest and they use heartier bread than most other places. In all; breakfast done right.  They also have a pretty extensive lunch and dinner menu and I know the appetizers are all tasty. Personally I like the beer battered onion rings. The burgers are large and juicy and they even offer a Kobi Burger although I have not tried it... yet.  The staff is professional, friendly and responsive to their customers needs. The facility is clean and well kept. If I had a complaint at all about the restaurant it's that it's too dark. They offer a selection of free mags in the foyer (City Life, LV Weekly, etc) but it is so dark reading them is a challenge. That also means reading the menu is a challenge. It's not as if turning up the lights would reveal a shabby establishment; there is a lot of beautiful custom wood work all around and it might be nice if they showed it off making reading easier.  If you are a regular be sure to get the \"loyalty card\" and present it with your bill each time to dine or drink. After 200 points they send you a $20.00 gift certificate and they have specials and birthday offers as well. It's worth the effort for the perks.  This qualifies as one of my \"Cheers\" locals because when we come in (usually for breakfast) the crew knows our order and how we like it. Isn't it great becoming a regular at a restaurant you like? It makes dining all the more relaxing and I for one am looking for a relaxing time when I go out to eat.  So, why do I give Steiner's only 3 stars? Here is my breakdown for stars that I have been meaning to post somewhere:  1 Star: I am not coming back to this place unless you pay me and may not even then. The experience here was so bad I want it to be forgettable but it will probably linger in my memory like a tuna sandwich that sat out too long and is now sitting in my stomach reminding me of its' presence with every wicked burp.  2 Stars: The experience here is forgettable but I would return if I must. In this case the food is edible, the staff is passable, and the environment is at least clean when they put down paper mats, but I will not be chasing any rolling meat balls and taking advantage of the five second rule. You know the type of place; they are usually called 'greasy spoons' which are far too common for my taste.  3 Stars: These are nice places and I would have no problem returning. The food is good but not great, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the facility is obviously clean and maintained. While I am still not chasing wayward meat balls I might think about if they don't go too far. It will be a place I will remember as a positive experience and on my regular or semi-regular places to go.  4 Stars: These establishments have shown me something special in some way. It may be the food is exceptional (usually they have spiced their offerings a little more liberally or prepared then exceptionally), or the service is very good and the staff is friendly and always with a smile, or the environment is memorable and offers something that is not at every other place around town (like live music but not 20 screens in a sports bar). 4 star places are places I will treat myself to when I want to feel special or for a special occasion. (My wife and I have a Thai place and a couple others on this short list.)  5 Stars: A 5 star restaurant has be is something really special but this does not mean expensive or fancy. For a place to rate 5 stars for me I have to have a \"long term relationship\" with them. I have to know that going there is ALWAYS a great experience or the food is GREAT, not just exceptional or good. As of this writing I have only posted two 5 star establishments and it may be a while until I add any more. For me giving a 5 star rating means the place is special on many levels, be it the food, service or environment or a combo. I plan on giving out very few 5 star ratings.  So, Steiner's falls right smack dab in the 3 star zone and I am happy for it... and so should you. Give them a try, there is a lot to like there.",

    "text": "On a 5-star scale, i'll start them at 5, because the food we had was very good. We ordered from the happy hour menu, got hot wings, and some polish sausage sandwiches with cole slaw.  Both came with some yummy Brew City fries.  The wings were hot, crispy, and very very spicy.  The sausage was nothing special, but good.  The problem is, this \"friendly locals pub\" was less than friendly, to say the least.    Subtract 1st star, because...  the ditzy bartender told us it wasn't happy hour yet when i asked about specials (it was THREE MINUTES before happy hour). Subtract 2nd star because the ditzy bartender told us she had no clue what was on their happy hour menu that had conflicting specials..  We asked her about a local beer, what type it was, and she said \"um, it's kind of like (shrug) beer.\"  Hello?  Anybody home?  We continue to play video poker while waiting on Monday Night football to start.  Subtract 3rd star because we were ignored once our food was served. I found out later why.  OK, We are now down to two stars. It's hard to play seriously while we are eating so we didn't hit the poker that hard while eating. Of course, the people near us were doing the same thing, so didn't think THAT was a problem. UNTIL Ditz bartender goes off duty.    We finish food, and just before i start playing again, a new bartender shows up. He hands us our check and said he needed the machines. Really? We played, ate, drank, and are continuing to play. His answer? They needed our spot for their \"regulars\" to watch Monday night football. MNF is WHY we went there in the first place.   One more star gone.  And, it's not like they comped a drink either for playing.  We tend to go to \"locals\" pubs instead of places on the strip, and this is the first time we've EVER been treated poorly, and not been comped at least 1 drink for playing video poker.  There goes the last stars. Zero stars for them.    So, we moved to a table to finish my beer (no, he didn't even let us sit there till i finished it.) Apparently this is standard practice, 'cause i said something to another server, and they just said, \"oh, ok\". Now they are at -1 stars, and i can't rate them that low.  Sadly, Yelp forces me to give them at least 1 star.  If you're a regular in LV, then i'm sure Steiners is OK -  good food, fair beer selection, reasonably priced.  But, just be aware that they do cater only to the Locals, and really don't care about visitors.",

    "text": "Decent locals sportsbar with a good bar menu and choice of beer, the food didn't disappoint and the prices were really surprisingly great.  They have daily specials, and I ate here on my way back to LA.  I took advantage of their burger special, which was $10 for a US Kobe burger (from Montana, at least they're honest).  Other burgers were all $7 which was half price, I think it was a happy hour special.  I also ordered their tortilla soup which as decent.  The burger was ok.  I ordered it Medium, but it seemed a little dry an certainly no different than non-\"Kobe burgers\" in texture or taste.  The one thing that did stick out though was that it was served on Hawaiian King buns, which gave it a little sweetness and I really liked.  Service was very friendly, my waiter came and checked on me every 15 min or so and he seemed like he was really eager for me to enjoy the food.  If I lived closer, I'd probably be a regular.",

    "text": "It is not often anyone finds me in a bar, pub or tavern, but I must say this is one that I would drop in again in the future.  So we had a going away dinner for a friend that was leaving Las Vegas, obviously, at another joint that served gourmet burgers.  Afterwards, the many party animals I was with wanted to turned the casual dinner into a more complete entertainment evening, and the bar that with just across the street turned out to be as fun as hanging out at a funeral with the other 2 people that showed up.  So after a quick search on the Yelp app, we all converged on Steiner's A Nevada Style Pub.  When I walked in the place looked pretty dead.  Luckily that was just the section of the establishment that was shutdown at that time of the night, which they offered to open up if we wanted to sit there.  Very accommodating.  Bonus points noted.  The section at the bar was lively with a good mix of people just hanging out and having what looks to be a rather fabulous good time.  Good sign.  After a quick looksee, we decided to sit at what looks like two long bar counter seating areas that were built right next to each other, complete with this railing this splitting the table into two halves.  Since we all knew each other, we avoided any potential awkward moments when two dudes accidentally made eye contacts with the fella across the table.  But the construction of this social table elevated the challenge difficulty of sharing plates of appetizers, which is probably what the bartenders are looking for when gauging which drunken patrons to cut off for the night.   While most others opted for beers, whiskeys, and other adult libations, I studied their food menu under their burgers section, but made a last minute play change at the time of ordering to their Burger of the Month (I am a total sucker for these specials).  The burger was prepared a nice medium rare as requested, the toppings all came together nicely, and I was very satisfied with my ordering decision.  The nachos somebody order was good too.  Would I come back?  If you read what I wrote in the beginning, you already know the answer (otherwise, scroll back up buddy!)  Why?  Service was good, our waiter checked up on us regularly, even the cook from the kitchen came out to check if I liked the burger (nice!).  Food was good. The place was fun and not that far from where I work.  Plenty of TVs to watch whatever games or the Sochi Olympics while you have the option to chill the hell out.  Almost a no brainer.

You can get beef or chicken. We always get the chicken. It comes on top of some greens with some yummy carmelized onions and peppers, along with some jack and cheddar cheese. Mmmmm I can taste it now! Then they put pico de gallo on top. Served with poblano and sonoma jack cheese quesadilla wedges, The dressing is guacamole or salsa ranch. We always ask for both and extra because together it is DELICIOUS!!! The salad is really amazing here, The combination of flavors are very good!! There is a bar not far from where they seat people and it can get pretty loud. The one thing we noticed is this location can get very busy I think we were there while they had happy hour or when sports maybe on because there was not many tables open and the bar was very busy. Plus being so busy the servers are very busy so you don't get the service you would normally get. We sat for awhile before we had drink refills.  Other than that we LOVE going for dinner you get a good size bowl of salad and there are many times you have to take it home as long as you did not put the dressing all over it.  Check this place out!  I hear they have pretty good drink specials during happy hour and the food is really good!! It is always consistent!",

For years I would tell my wife about Steiner's and how good the food was and that it was just a very COOL place to hangout. Well on 01.02.2016 we went to the Mob Museum and when we left I asked her where she wanted to eat and she said... you always talk about Steiner's let's go there... so we did ...WOW What a great surprised.... Steiner's you did not disappointed me and my wife Loved it.  So trust me/us... Even time possible when we are in Vegas... we will make it a point to stop and have a bite to eat, Something to dirnk...

Although it was very dark inside, like so many other LV bars, it was surprisingly clean, cool, and most important, well ventilated.  Plenty of people were smoking in there, and at first I was put off by that, but after a few moments I noticed the lack of smoke. Bonus!    The food was A-OK!  I had the fish and chips, and they were just fine.  Not greasy, decent coleslaw, and crisp fries.

We took advantage of their BOGO beer special from 4 - 7p. A couple of large mugs of ice cold refreshment for less than $6? How about HELL YES? We didn't even have to ask for another round, they asked and brought it right over.   We ordered the Caesar Trojan Burger with Onion Rings and the Fried Chicken in a Basket. Both super yummy. We had a good buzz going and obviously weren't thinking very clearly because we ended up ordering dessert as well: Sinful Frozen Cappuccino Sundae Pie and Incredible Hot Bourbon Brownie Sundae. Both were very rich but oh so good. I think we'll skip the sugar overload next time though.   I'm glad I read and trusted some of the good reviews for Steiner's. I can't believe we waited this long to check it out. This may very well be our new hang out spot!",

The bartender was very friendly at first but as I sat longer and had asked if the kitchen was open he never brought a menu and stayed towards the other end of the bar.  I ordered potato skins and the man that brought them out was more than kind however my drink sits empty, I have no napkins, and I haven't seen the bartender in 10 minutes.  Kind of ridiculous for a bar that has 10 people at it at 3am.  I am a beverage manager and can assure you my bartenders would be written up with this type of service.  I could walk out at this point and he would have no idea based on his attentiveness.  Very disappointing for a bar that I frequent.",

Same can be said about a portobello mushroom sandwich. All I'm  saying is, they should bring back the Boca, a lot more suitable for their type of menu. Very disappointed.  Update: the manager came to the table  Since he knew I was unhappy. I explained to him exactly what I said here, and he said he would bring it up at managers meeting. He explained the reasoning behind d/c'ing certain items which I understand. Just hoping they get them back.",

    "text": "I really enjoy Steiner's, and I would say it is one of the better \"local\" bars to go to.  Food is reasonably priced and the drink specials are great.  They have a better than average beer selection, although a great deal of that is bottled.  There are a lot of televisions which is great if you are a sports fan.    As far as seating goes, they have two cool features:  1 - There is a long table in the center of the room that probably seats 20.  They will take a reservation even for a Friday or Saturday night.  If you and a bunch of friends want to go out drinking and not have to worry about getting a table all together, this is definitely a good spot.  2 - There is a large round table that has Guiness and (I believe) Bass on draft right at the table.  You pour for yourself and pay by the ounce.  Not a bad option!  When you go, you will find that they have a happy hour from 3 - 7pm which includes reduced price appetizers and 2 for 1 drinks.  This, however, is somewhat misleading.  The appetizers are not in fact \"half off\" as some reviews have said, but instead are priced at $3, $5 or $7.  This is somewhat confusing because the menu does not actually list the price so you do have to ask.  Also, the happy hour on food ends at 6, while the happy hour on drinks goes until 7.    The other issue is that they can't seem to get their story straight on 2 for 1 beers.  Some of the servers/bartenders tell you that if you order them they both get delivered at the same time, others offer to bring you them one at a time.  Some of the servers/bartenders think its a great idea to split your 2 for 1 with a friend, allowing you cheaper prices and the opportunity to try a variety of beers, others frown on this an seem to insist that you only order for yourself.  Once you get past the varied rules and learn the system its a pretty great place to be.",

    "text": "Good Happy Hour. Nice breakfasts. Very good beer selection ( draft & bottle.)   I hold on to one star only because I don't agree with tying up 5 beer taps with American pilsners. On second thought its 6 including a Canadian beer. Two taps for that style is sufficient.  Not trying to sound like anti mass-market beer snob. I just like variety.",

The service has really been off lately, either the waiters are slow, or the food takes forever when they're not even busy.   Only the one guy we like seems to give good service.   I hope it improves because the food is great pub food!",

    "text": "On Las Vegas Boulevard without being caught up in the chaos of the strip. My friends and I stopped by this bar to grab a drink and a quick bite before we headed to a movie at the South Point. Knowing that the casino would be packed, we came here.  At first, I was  hesitant to come because my first experience was disappointing. This second time, it was better. We entered around 10pm and sat ourselves at one of the side booths. The wait staff were slow to acknowledge our presence, but after we made it clear we were there, they were more attentive.   The menu is extensive and that can backfire. Like I said, my first experience had me never wanting to come back. I didn't care for their chili. I was impressed with the extensive salad choices. On Thursday, they have a  BBQ chicken served over cold soba noodles with tons of veggies tossed in. The marinade for the chicken remind me of the Chinese style BBQ except it was more salty than sweet. The half portion was 8.95 and was enough to tide me over. I was trying to be healthy, but could not help stealing my friends fries. They were thick cut and fried to a golden brown. Absolutely perfect.  A bonus, they were playing so much 90's alternative. Nothing like some Smashing Pumpkins and Bush to remind me of my childhood.",

Extremely attentive, my drink never ran dry and would make me complex drinks with no problem. Makes a hell of a Knob Creek manhattan. Probably the best one I've had. Steiner's itself is a great bar to come and relax after work and have a drink and some good food. 5/5",

    "text": "I was not impressed...the food was simply not as good as I remember from a few years ago. The quality of the \"lettuce\" (it's not supposed to be white) in the house salad was so poor I could barely find more than a few green leaves. I sent it back and our server was nice enough when I said I didn't like it, however he left it in the bill and it was worked into the price of the Fish & Chips basket at $12.99 even though it shows as \"add a house salad for $2.00\" which has me wondering if I was being scammed. I pointed it out to the server and he offered to void out the first and rerun it, however to save myself from being inconvenienced, I just took $2.00 off my 20% tip. The pieces of fish were somewhat thin, the coleslaw was too stringy with not enough mayo or flavor. The Saturday special pot roast was tasty, as were the lumpy, in a good way, mashed potatoes, although the veggies were under seasoned. Perhaps if the prices were a little bit less I would not expect as much...I see no point in returning.",

    "text": "Really want to give this place a 1 but because of 'Bianca, the Hostess who greeted us with a smile and was constantly asking if we needed anything, they get a three.  Then we met our server Ashley, she had  short answers when we asked questions about Happy Hour and at one point i said will there be Pucker shots in tubes ( I've been to the Steiner's .several times on the west side of town for St. Patrick's Day and had a blast), Ashley said to me, \" I haven't heard that we are doing that\",  joking with a laugh I said \"Well then we are going to have to leave\", without missing a beat she said \" No problem, I can cash out your check\", WOW.............really and she walked away.......It continued with eye rolls and had to ask for a new, cold glass for  beers that were in bottles not draft.  I asked Bianca for celery and blue cheese, Ashley came by and said \"You want celery??, I'll have to charge you $2 or $3 dollars, I told her  that was fine and with blue cheese, She came back with a pile of celery and no blue cheese, when we asked, instead of just saying oh i'll get some, we got \" No one asked me\" as she turned and walked away. I could go on but to what end. All I can say is I've lived in this town 40 years and I have never stiffed a server or anyone else who works for tips.  I was embarrassed that I had suggested this place to 5 other friends with so many other places we could have gone. She got less than 10% tip but it should have been nothing. I have never seen a bill that charges for the tequila and extra for the mix when you order a margarita but this place does. Really too bad because the West side Steiner's are friendly, fun and have great food.   If not for great friends the night would have been a bust.I imagine they cater to tourist and i guess she feels she can act anyway she wants as there will be different groups every weekend.   So everyone can form their own opinions but for me, I  will never be back....",
