Everything is good so go ahead and order something you wouldn't normally go for. The rolls have funny names like Stacey's Mom and I Love My Ass...it's funny to hear the servers repeat it back to you.

The sushi is super fresh--it glistens, like it came straight out of the water, sliced up, and jumped right onto your plate! haha! When it comes to sashimi and nigiri, they give you thick, fresh cuts of fish.  This is the only place in the city that I've been to that has THE freshest tasting uni (if you have any suggestions otherwise, please comment ;)).  I could eat a million orders of their uni.   Service is cool.  The ambiance is casual.  I suggest sitting up at the sushi bar cuz those dudes are awesome.  I'm not gonna leave a super long review, because people have already raved about this place.  The rolls are great, appetizers are great--THE FOOD IS GREAT. LOL. Just go, you won't be disappointed.  It's worth the $$, especially if you enjoy good quality sushi.",

Just some really fresh fish with subtle flavor to it. I don't know what it was, but it tasted just right. Wife ordered some sushi rolls (caterpillar, salmon skin, and philly) along with some udon noodles, also good, but I think I was still in a daze from the first course. I will say this though, sometimes we pop in just to have some udon and an order or two of sushi.  I liked that we were seated at a table as soon as we walked in the door, though that's probably due more to luck and good timing. I was really impressed by our waitress, fast and friendly, she really took care of us. When she noticed that the plates that came out first were dishes that my wife wasn't eating she immediately went back to the kitchen and brought another plate as soon as it was ready. I thought that was some damn fine service, worthy of 5 stars. So, thanks for dinner everyone at I Love Sushi.",

I feel that I have found the absolute best sushi place in Vegas, and I Love Sushi is not it.  The food wasn't bad though.  The tuna didn't look as fresh as I would have liked, so I chose to leave that part of my Hawaiian roll to my friend.  If he got sick, well it was his fault for dragging me there.   The Monkey Roll was pretty good.  That was really the only way I got out of feeling like I was cheating on my sushi place; by eating things on the menu that my joint didn't offer. Tried my first oyster shooter at I Love Sushi.  To quote myself the day that I tried it, \"How is it possible that they took a lot of really really good things, put them together, and made them awful?\"  Oyster on the half shell for me, please.  I did like how big it was and the kimonos that the hostess/waitress wore.  Very colorful.  Loved the sound of their flip-flops flippy-flopping.  One last thing....is there anyone else that felt like they were borderline dark-dining?  It's called a L-A-M-P.",

The sauces were also amazing.  But most impressive of all was the gentleman who was seating the guests.  He appeared to be the owner. We arrived around 7:30 and the place was packed. We asked for a booth. Even though the available booth was for 6 people (and it was just the 2 of us), he gave us the booth  - after I told him we had travelled from LA and had heard great things about this restaurant :) All the servers were attentive and super friendly.   Definitely will visit again the next time we are in town.  YUMMMMMY sushi!!  Recommend 'rock and roll', 'gary's special', one night stand' and the seaweed salad was also delishhhhh.   Thank you \"I Love Sushi\"!",

The staff are all friendly.  As soon as you walk in, the entire staff greets you.    Some of my favorite rolls include the screaming orgasm, spring mountain roll, almost 90%, and the lisa hand roll.  Just writing this review makes me want to go have some now!!!!!",

In an area where all you can eat(AYCE) is just about everywhere, this restaurant does NOT offer that.  Just traditional order what you want and they'll serve it up fresh.  I gauge sushi establishments by my favorite fish, hamachi.  I order both nigiri and sashimi (when I want to spoil myself) I love sushi (ILS) has never disappointed me.  It's always so buttery smooth with that hint of fish.  The cuts are perfect, not to thin/thick.  There are other sushi places around but not \"I-Love-Sushi\" good as my boys will describe it.  Really good atmosphere.  On any given day, it's busy from 5:30pm to 7:30pm but it is worth the wait.",

    "text": "\"I Love Sushi\" is easily my favorite sushi place in the Vegas Valley. Sure, it doesn't have the private garden, koi pond, and waterfall of \"Mizumi\" at Wynn Casino, but it doesn't have the same high prices, either. The fish may not also be as high quality as the product at \"Bar Masa\" in Aria (which only uses fish that have been out of Japan's waters for 24 hours or less), but I've never heard any complaints from anyone I've brought there.   The menu at \"I Love Sushi\" is extensive -- especially the amazing sushi roll options -- and the atmosphere is usually fun and lively. The creative sushi roll names always elicit laughs from first-time visitors and it's a great place for a casual date or group outing with friends. It's definitely a place that can get kind of loud, however, with a casual environment that's usually not conducive to a quiet romantic dinner (especially on a busy weekend night).   I always start off with the spicy edamame and some of my favorite menu items are the Kiss of Fire, Screaming Orgasm, and John Holmes.    If you're in the mood for great sushi and you don't want to deal with the hassle and high prices of a trip to the Strip, I definitely recommend this place.",

There's ample parking, the restaurant is large and has a u shaped sushi counter with tables and booths on both sides. I like to begin my sushi meals with an order of salmon sashimi or sushi depending on my mood. I judge places by the quality of their salmon and the cut of the salmon here was thick and long. Very generous!   The menu was a little overwhelming so I recommend looking at the hundreds of pictures on Yelp to help you decide what to order. You definitely need to know what the right things to order are. I like everything we ordered but we were only there for a quick bite so we only tried 3 things. I can't wait to return to try more of their menu.",

    "text": "Maybe we were there on an off night, because our experience was terrible. My husband and I arrived on a Wednesday night for dinner. We had a table for 2, and the restaurant was not overly busy. Our server was polite, and continually checked on us, which is great. We placed our order, my husband ordered from the hibachi, and I ordered 2-rolls, and we ordered saki. Nothing too crazy or out of the ordinary.  My husband received his meal within about 5-10 minutes after placing the order, but it came out without the rice. No big deal, we can live with that. The meal was hot, and looked fine. The taste was fine, but the meat was very tough. Again, we can kinda live with that, hey tough met happens. We waited and waited for my order to come through...and waited...and waited....  We were watching the sushi bar the entire time, and there were sushi chefs available to make our remaining order, so we thought, maybe our order got lost. Our waitress returned when my husband was almost done with his meal and brought the rice she forgot to bring out during the first arrival of his food. Rice was very bad.  My order finally came 45-minutes later. Let that sink in. 45-minutes later. 2-rolls. They were absolutely horrible. I love sushi. I love sashimi. The rolls tasted like really bad rotten fish, and even had the rotten smell. I gagged with the first bite, and thought maybe it's in my head. I tried bite number two and lost it. The waitress returned and she asked \"Do you not like your meal?\" I responded by saying what I thought, and she said \"Thank you for being so nice to me, most people want the manager, thank you.\" At this point I just wanted taco bell. She didn't offer a refund or to even give a discount. We didn't ask. We had already spent almost 2-hours there and walked out paying $60 for a horrible experience.  By the way, this was our 3rd time there, and it was only my first experience that was great. The sushi chef was Joe, and we sat at the bar. He was not there the other two times, so maybe he's the key to the success? I don't know, but we will not return. :(",

I tried the sushi boat called the love boat.  Little expensive for what you get. Think it's more for show.  I would love if they had a build your own boat option.  Not sure if I would go again unless that was an option to try. Other items I saw around looked good but not sure taste.",

They are friendly and nice.   Between three people, we ordered the large screaming orgasm, Gyoza, Rick and roll and the fire(?) roll.  The Gyoza was fried and came with ponzu dipping sauce. The outside was crunchy but the inside a little mushy. I have had better but it's not bad. The rock and roll was by far our favorite. Salmon yellowtail tuna and crab meat wrapped in cucumber. It also came with a sauce but I just ate it plain with a slice of lemon. Very fresh and hits the spot. The fire roll not only looked like Mexican food, but tasted like it too. Too saucy and tart, couldn't really taste the fish. The screaming orgasm was drowning in sauce but it was quite tasty. 10 pieces of seared tuna for 16 bucks. We were so overwhelmed by sauce that we decided to order one more roll, the eel one with the spicy tuna. I really liked that roll. I got the fresh fish taste from the spicy tuna and the sweetness from the eel.   Overall I would come back again but I have had better for the price. Over all everything was 70 bucks all together.",

Now the bad part:  the sushi tasted fresh enough, their menu is too big to parse out, and they wanted to start taking our orders immediately.  Everything is a la carte, no AYCE.  I did not love a single item of the 4-5 rolls we ordered.  We tried a sushi nacho thing that was too sweet, the sauces were either spicy and runny or poorly described on the menu.  Every item was just a little OFF.  The worst part comes today as my boyfriend and I have been sick all morning with GI distress after visiting.  I walked out last night disappointed and I woke up beyond angry that now I can't travel today because I'm locked in my bathroom.  Update: I called the restaurant the next day and a manager got back to me 4 days later.  They were very kind and apologetic, I chose a refund of my money instead of a credit at the restaurant.  I'm glad they offer this sort of service.",

It's also got a bit of a spicy kick which I love!   I Love Sushi also has awesome spicy garlic edamame. Definitely can't go wrong with some deliciously seasoned edamame to share as a starter.  I usually come here for sake and beers, so I haven't explored their menu too much yet. My friends get the rolls and I've tried a piece here and there - not bad at all. I'll have to write a more detailed review when I really feast on their sushi.   Service is quick; the servers are Korean as they yell out orders in Korean to one another across the restaurant. The few times I've been here the servers have always been attentive. They just happen to check up on us when I need another sake or beer...  The menu items here are a little pricier but I don't mind for the taste and service. I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm craving their tuna poke and some sake!",

The fish was high quality and the rolls were reasonably priced. We were AYCE status stuffed and the bill was only $60 pre tip and that included a large Sapporo.  We started of with steamed Gyoza that were around $5 and edamame. For our rolls we opted for Rainbow roll, scallop roll, screaming orgasm roll, and an assortment of nigiri (salmon, yellowtail and scallop). The fish was very fresh and the rolls were not overloaded with yum sauce or cream cheese. The place does get packed in the evenings during dinner rush.   Keep in mind, there is no AYCE option here, but the quality of the food and the great service that accompanies it warrants paying the regular prices.",

Then, there are the restaurants that serve AYCE, or various fried rolls, or rolls with lots of different sauces, or rolls with weird sexual names.  I love sushi falls into this second category. It's not that it's bad - actually, I thought it was quite good - but don't go there expecting a great meal of nigiri and sashimi. Instead, order your 'screaming orgasm' and your 'sushi nachos' and enjoy them....and order some extra yum yum sauce on the side.",

My money would have been better spent at an AYCE elsewhere.  We made a reservation for a table of 8. Easy, no problem, on time. 7PM Thursday night and the place was PACKED- Play it safe and make a reservation! The waitresses are all dressed in cheap kimonos and are HORRIBLE. One of the waitresses came over and asked who ordered the 'Screamo' (the roll was called the 'Screaming Orgasm') The restaurant was loud, we were a party of 8- none of us claimed the roll. The waitress ended up getting extremely angry insisting that it was our roll. We eventually figured out which roll she was talking about apologized for not understanding, but come on. Why work at a restaurant with a ton of dirty names if you don't want to say them out loud? It wasn't our fault we thought you had a different roll!  The sushi boat with terriyaki, katsu, sushi we ordered was larger than expected and worth the price if you're going to be sharing with a large group.  Candy Cane: Yellowtail and tuna covered rolls that looks like a candy cane. Not too saucy, perfect amount of raw.  Kiss of fire: A popular roll but I'm unsure why. It's spicier than anything I've previously experienced and tastes only of sricha.  Overall the sushi=4, service=1.",

I told him I preferred cooked fish over raw, and he definitely made my taste buds and tummy happy. If I can remember the O'Ryan roll was fab!  Each time I've been here, I've had no problem with service. And, I love their huge selection of crazy-innovative sushi rolls. I have yet to find a place like this in SD!  It's also super spacious inside. I love eating here whenever I'm in town. If you end up eating here, be fun and adventurous and try something new!   Prices for the rolls are a little higher, but totally worth it!",

Maybe its the way they immediately greet you when you walk in the door. Even if there is a wait, which there typical when we go on the weekends, its only 10 -15 minutes.   Our favorite - The screaming orgasm, seared ahi with a mayo and vinegar sauce on top of daikon radish! Yum.. the only difference I have seen over the years is the portion is getting smaller. The large order now looks like what the small did 4 years ago.   The bonzai roll is another favorite, shrimp tempura rolled into a california roll and drizzled with teryaki sauce. Spicy salmon another good choice along with the James Bond roll.   All this with a Sapporo beer makes for a great dinner out!   If you love sushi, this is a place to try. They have a huge selection, food tastes great and the service is fast!",

Who would have thought there would be so many sushi restaurants out this way, but many there are and thanks to a recommendation from a local in the know we found I Love Sushi.   I'm not a sushi expert but I can tell when the food is fresh and of excellent quality. Next time you're in a sushi restaurant order some Uni. It's a good way to gauge the quality of the food. I Love Sushi's Uni scores well.  Sitting at the bar, I thought the sushi chefs were professional, friendly, entertaining, funny and good at what they do which is to make great looking and tasty sushi.  The service was very attentive, almost too much so, but that could be attributed to the fact that this restaurant actually reads their Yelp reviews and realized that people have previously made comments about their iffy service.   Here are two dishes I've had and really liked, the Caterpillar Roll - tempura shrimp, cucumber, eel topped with avocado and eel sauce; and the Dragon Roll - California roll topped with eel and eel sauce. Both were fresh, fresh, fresh.",

    "text": "\"I love Sushi\" should be changed to \"I love variety\" instead.  While I love sushi does offer the traditional nigiri, this place offers way too much rolls that it's almost mind boggling. And the only reason why their rolls are so big is because pack in a lot of rice. The quality of their seafood/fish isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it's good either. It isn't the freshest I've ever had. For the times I've been here, it's always pretty packed and service is ok.  Suggestion: to simplify the menu, instead of naming each roll a different name, maybe it should be called one name and put alternative ingredients underneath each name as suggestions of how you can build your sushi...OR if you keep each name, put it by type of ingredients so I don't have to go on searching for specific rolls that have i.e. shrimp tempura, or one's with philly cheese because there is too many freakin' rolls to go through and read. Ai yi yi....  Bottom line: Don't think this place is really worth going to considering all that I've said + it's pretty pricey for a place that offers mediocre fish. I also suspect that this place isn't run by or is guided by someone of Japanese decent just by the way the rolls are prepared/served....",

    "text": "I love sushi, so when I had some free time in this neighborhood, I popped in. Love the interior, it's so intense it's almost on par with a theme restaurant, in a good way. The service was also really good, everyone was friendly and enthusiastic.  The food was kind of hit or miss though. Got a few orders of nigiri and loved the cut: long, thick, generous slices and a great rice ratio. But the texture and flavor seemed to indicate that the fish was recently defrosted.   The rolls are the way to go here, and the popular Washington roll is awesome. I like that they have a variety of riceless rolls, but the Cherry Blossom just tasted off- maybe the oil was old, but the soft shell crab did not taste fresh and something in the roll was extremely peppery and offputting. Would give them another try, since they seem to usually be pretty great, but the actual food did not live up to expectations on my visit.",

    "text": "Wow this place was a let down. Service was extremely slow. Everything from getting our order in, getting our food, and getting the bill took way too long. The server checked on our table only once.  They don't have AYCE as an option. The rolls were priced higher than most places, but the rolls were a little bigger.   I ordered the D.C. roll and the Happy Ending roll. They were ok, nothing that made me say \"omg this is so good\" more like \"eh, I've had better\" haha. The D.C. roll had soft shell crab in it, which is my favorite thing, but I did not like it in this roll. It left a burnt flavor in the roll like it was fried for too long. If you order this roll I also do not recommend pouring all of the special sauce on it at one time. I made that mistake and it was just too much for the roll. The Happy Ending also had a lot going on, they burnt the soft shell crab in this roll too. It was good, but I think next time I would stick to a regular Japanese lasagna roll.  I was in the area and wanted to give it a try because of the reviews... but im very picky about my sushi places so I don't see myself coming back here.",

    "text": "Visited on Saturday September 3, 2016 at 8PM.  This restaurant is located on Eastern & Sundridge Heights (just South of St. Rose Pkwy).    For ambiance, I give this place 10 stars!!!  It's a massive restaurant with japanese paper booths lining the walls and a huge sushi counter in the middle with glass displays of the fresh fish.  All the waitresses are seriously foxy and dressed as geishas.  There is even an old asian man at the door greeting people and shouting orders at the servers.  I dig it!   $63.48 got us two sushi rolls, edamame, two soft drinks, and a dinner entree.  The dinner entree allows you to pick two proteins and then it comes with rice, miso soup, a salad, tempura rice, gyoza, and half an orange.  My husband chose chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu and liked both a lot.  I stole his miso soup and I gotta say it's about the best I've ever had.  It was hot and salty and earthy and had plenty of tofu and seaweed.    I got a sex on the beach roll which consisted of raw spicy scallop, crab, masago, scallion, cucumber, and salmon and then I asked them to add lemon since they don't offer a lemon roll like every other damn sushi place in Vegas. This roll made me gag a little bit but my husband ate it with no problems.   To be fair this was my first time trying raw scallop and I think I don't like it.    The other roll I got was much better and was called the double D roll.  It had tempura shrimp, cucumber, crab, salmon, masago, and avocado.   They brought me a delicious sauce called 69 and I dunked my pieces in there and they were edible.    I had hamachi kama here for the first time and now I see why so many people love it.  It's the \"collar\" of the fish (the area around the flippers but behind the gills).  The fish is so soft and squishy, and also fatty and salty.  It's like a tiny treasure hunt digging around the bones and fins and getting every little morsel out of every nook and cranny.  I used my hands because I'm obviously 3 years old on the inside and have no manners.  I could have eaten 5 of these seriously.   They have literally over a hundred different rolls so I'd say definitely take your time and read all the ingredients and you'll find a roll you like.  For the money I'd rather go to Sakana, Yama, or Goyemon, and enjoy the freedom of AYCE but this place has an amazing ambiance.",

I have to say that this place was interesting because the waitresses actually wear kimonos and have accents. My server was pretty sassy which made things even more enjoyable lol. I tried the Ryan's roll which was pretty good. It reminded me of a standard crunchy roll, but this one cost like $15, so I don't know if I would get it again. The Screaming Orgasm was really good too and the small portion was only $10. The seared tuna was good and I would probably get it again. I liked it because it was fresh (not like some places with the chewy or stale looking fish), had a slightly spicy aftertaste, and had a bunch of sprouts and stuff which made me feel healthy. It was pretty busy so you know that is a good sign.",

The service is very friendly, and the atmosphere is a happy one.  I have been here 7 times, and plan on continuing to go back. Easy to park and relaxed atmosphere.",

Our server took her order and even asked her a second time what it was to be sure. My friends roll came out and it had no crunch or eel sauce on it... Also, our server was not friendly or very good. Never have had a super good experience here.",

    "text": "This is where I broke my Las Vegas sushi cherry... TMI?  After a long day of driving a U-Haul across the CA/NV stateline, lifting and unpacking boxes I was ready to eat, but I was sick of fast-food and pizza options. I yelped Sushi and this place popped up with 4 1/2 stars? Let's do this!   I placed an order for pick-up and they said it would take about ten minutes. Hmmm, ten minutes for 2 orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls? I decided to test this and arrived 8 minutes & 25 seconds later. \"Hi, order for Tiffany?\" (my GF) \"Yup, right here...two orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls\"...whoa, this place is on it, but how does it taste?  I brought it home and feasted. The Udon Tempura was very good and full of flavor. The tempura was delightful, not to greasy just lite and flaky. Poi-fect! The Caterpillar rolls you could tell were super fresh and delicious. These were definitely made to order.   This place gets an easy 4 stars. I'm coming back to get the full restaurant experience soon. Maybe this will lead to an updated review and a added star?",

We got sat at a table with walls around it so it was almost like having our own room. The waitresses wear traditional Japanese garments and speak very little English. It's considered casual but you would look a little under dressed if you showed up in board shorts and flip flops. It is a very cool setup and added to the experience.   Now about the amazing food. Sadly enough I didn't try the sushi but I did get the vegetable tempura which was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever had. My sister got the chicken Lo mein and it had such an amazing flavor to it I wanted to eat her whole meal! My boyfriend got the platter with shrimp tempura and teriyaki chicken. It was huge and he loved it. I think he picked the best thing on the menu!   Overall it was amazing and definetly will be a returning customer.",

Japanese Lasagna, Tastes like my ex-wife, and Screaming orgasm are all rolls featured on the menu at I Love Sushi.  I've never had a bad bite of anything here.  My only complaint about the food, is that many of the rolls are bathed in sauce.  For me, this is a no-no.  A little sauce is alright, but drowning something in spicy mayo only aims to hide poor quality ingredients, and the quality here is superb.  Even when this place gets jumping, and it does, the service is outstanding.  Food arrives in a timely manner, and is at the right temperature.    The Sushi Bomb here is out of this world, and definitely my favorite thing on the menu.  It is simple and satisfying.   It is tuna or salmon sashimi served with fresh wasabi.  This is HOT HOT HOT.  Stuffy sinuses seak shelter from this inferno of tasty heat.    A great date spot, I Love Sushi is a solid choice for good quality fish in the Anthem area.",

My step daughter never had rolls before and she said d spider roll was really yummy. Kiss of fire was actually spicy, unlike some other \"spicy\" rolls elsewhere. She also had chicken teriyaki n chicken katsu which were both good and great for d price. Will definitely come back! Im so glad this place is close to my house :)",

I was there on 3/03/2016.   It is almost as if they want their customers to get in and out again as quickly as possible so more people can come to eat.  The tuna poki was way too spicy.  Even my hubby who likes a little spicy did not like it.  It was too hot for him.  They took away my cucumbers before I had finished them.  They did not bring wasabi or ginger to the table...I had to flag someone down to get it.  My rainbow roll tasted fishy.  It was so bad I didn't finish it.  I would have liked to discuss this with someone, but nobody ever came back to our table.  The green tea was scalding hot, too hot to drink.  By the time my first cup had cooled enough to drink, I was done eating.  As we left the restaurant, I mentioned going out the door that I did not like the rainbow roll, which in turn was said to me I should have mentioned it earlier.  Well, I would have liked to mention it earlier, but nobody ever came back to our table.  I got tired of waiting.  The food isn't worth the price, the hot tea too hot to drink and the follow-up service non-existent.  I won't recommend this restaurant, nor will I ever eat there again.  At least I didn't throw up what little I ate of the rainbow roll.  For an $85 tab for 2 people, the food and service should have been much better.",

They said they have it, but it is frozen. Hands down, without hesitation I passed on this. (Just an FYI.)  Recommend: * \"Bam bam\" * Oyster shooters - yet the oysters are small. * Ginjo - cold sake. Very tasty and smooth.  Pass: *Cucumber wrapped rolls, items listed without rice. They skimp on the  quantity/portion of the fillers for the rolls if you order it this way. A great disappointment. * Sashimi - magaro. Only came with 4 very small pieces. Not worth it.  Overall, the food was good. I would go again.",

Sit right at the bar and you'll get instant service. We never had a problem getting our orders to us in timely fashion. The Screaming orgasm was probably the tastiest of the specialty rolls we had. The meat was arranged in a poke like fashion over tasty crispy noodles and tangy sauce. I agree with a previous critic that they rely on sauce a little too much here, but it is tasty nonetheless. The jerry roll went down smoothly, and the crunch roll can be addicting. Dynamite was very filling and a good value pick ( if you don't mind baked rolls). For those who don't know, it's a mixture of scallop and chopped shrimp baked over rice soaked in a creamy sauce. They offer a huge selection of specialty rolls here but they also do nigiri. The yellowtail was very thick-- some of the biggest pieces of nigiri i've ever seen. The squid was as well. You don't have to go AYCE to get a good value here, especially if you're willing to try a number of their nigiri offerings.  We left quite full, and I would gladly return.",

It's busy, has a good buzz going, and the service is always good. The waiters are efficient, friendly and precise. Some of the women are career waiters and know how to work a table with humor. My favorite waiter is great with kids and engages in small talk without taking time away from her other tables.  Portions are big. This is white man's Japanese food. One \"John Holmes\" sushi roll for $12 is a meal. An order of tuna sashimi is bigger than anywhere I've ever been.  Food is consistent. You won't find toro, shima-aji, or kanpachi sushi here. That's not what their clientele wants. But the rolls are creative. I know what to expect and I've found items on the menu I'm comfortable ordering time and time again.    If you have friends that are rather middle-of-the-road, and not very adventurous, you can bring them here to introduce them to sushi. They'd also have plenty of meat and other cooked dishes to choose from.",

My kids love sushi but we're talking about how it was the best sushi we ever had. I love sushi is great but having Joe there puts it over the top for me.

    "text": "Wish I could give 3.5, but will be generous.    We ordered entrees rather than sushi.  We first shared the butter yaki appetizer with scallops.  I don't associate scallops with Japanese food so I don't really know why we ordered this, but OMG they were the most tender scallops I have ever eaten!  And the portion size was very generous, so we took half home.  They were still surprisingly tender after being reheated in a microwave four days later.  Wow!    The rest of our food was ok to very good, not spectacular.  We both ordered entrees that came with 2 main items.  My vegetable tempura was very good and the salmon teriyaki good, but my husband didn't like his two selections very well (mackerel and spicy chicken, both only ok).  However, the miso soup, salad and side dishes that come with the entrees were all good and we had a lot of food left over.  Overall, we were satisfied.  It was busy and we had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated.   It seemed noisy in the main/bar area, but luckily we ended up just to the left of the front door where it was a little quieter.  If we go back, which we probably will, we'll try the sushi because I suspect that's what they do best.  (Maybe the butter yaki again, too.)  But if we're in the mood for non-sushi entrees, we will probably stick with En Sushi.",

It wasn't all you can eat, but the amount of food we ate came out to what it would have cost at all you can eat. We ordered 3 full rolls each $10-14, and we also ordered a lunch special for $9 with tempura and chicken teriyaki, that include soup, and gyoza. We had a custom salmon roll that my son likes  and Gary's special roll and something else that my son ordered. Gary's roll was really great. I liked the sauce - sesame vinegar that was slightly spicy. The fish was really fresh. You can tell the difference. It wasn't fishy at all and was velvety. The lunch cost $51 without tip. It's a little more expensive than Sushimon but it was good. I'd go back.",

We liked it so much we got another one.  There's no rice in this one.  - Screaming Orgasm. Seared Ahi. What more can you ask. Fish was fresh. Sauce was good in this one as well. Available in small or large orders.  - Washington Roll.  I wasn't too much of a fan of this roll.  There was something about the consistency that didn't go right. It felt like too much was going on.  - Mountain Roll.  I for one really loved this roll. It's a california roll topped with salmon and baked.  Loved the sauce on this one.  - Honey Roll.  Deep Fried. This was tasty. Not the best roll we had but not the worse roll.  - Tempura Udon.  Someone in my party had this. I had a few bites and thought it was okay.  I love how they give free edamame.

    "text": "So I guess I recently went on a sushi splurge. What can I say? I love sushi! Hah  This place was hustling and bustling the Friday night that I came. We had a group of 8 people and they accommodated all of us very nicely in one booth. It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. It's a sushi/Japanese restaurant run by Koreans with waitresses in kimonos. Interesting..   Let's start off by the saying that the specialty sushi roll menu is.. well.. extensive. Like really extensive. There are so many options.. maybe too many options for my indecisiveness haha.. The sushi was not bad though. I ordered the Ryan roll which was basically a crunchy shrimp tempura roll with maguro and special sauce. It was quite tasty.  Our service was great! Considering how busy the place was, our server was really attentive and fun.   So why just the 4 stars? I was a little thrown back by the price of the rolls. My roll was $15 already. I was a little disappointed to find out they didn't have a AYCE option but it is what it is. (I think people from Hawaii are just too spoiled with cheap food) They also have bento boxes/dinner specials that also looked yummy. I would give those a try if I come back next time!",

As there were more employees than guest, kinda strange. Had to ask for help twice and took another ten minutes to get our order.  The garlic edamame was good but that was it.  I had the Baked Lobster and it was 95% mushroom and the little lobster they did give you wasn't even any good. Would not recommend.

    "text": "We have enjoyed patronizing \"I Love Sushi\" since it first opened.  But never again!    Yesterday we discovered a serious breach of integrity on the part of at least one person employed at that establishment and whom the management chose to support despite direct proof their employee lied.    My spouse was supposed to give our daughter $60 (1 $50 and 2 $5 bills) to help her buy wedding shoes for her betrothed (who could not afford to buy them himself). Regrettably, my spouse forgot to hand our daughter the money before we left the table and, instead, mistakenly left the money neatly folded on the table. Within two minutes of leaving the restaurant, however, we discovered the oversight and immediately telephoned the restaurant while circling back to recover it.    After being placed on hold three times and being told that our waitress said we paid our bill with a credit card and a cash tip of $20, the person managing the call put the waitress on the phone.  The waitress began to recite in terribly poor English what we ordered, rather than listening to our concern.  A striking contrast to her in-person use of English while taking our order, I might add.    We returned to the restaurant within minutes of leaving and went inside to where we were sitting. The money was nowhere to be found (either on or under the table).  Despite explaining what that money was intended for, all denied seeing or taking it.  Sure, we made the mistake of forgetting the money neatly folded on the table. However, we responded almost immediately by contacting the restaurant.  And, it was very clear this could not reasonably be consTrued as a tip based upon the price of our meal.  Management nevertheless refused to even consider that the waitress LIED despite the fact our receipt showed our meal and tip were BOTH paid by bankcard and not with any cash whatsoever (as the waitress claimed).  So there it is:  A lying employee backed by management despite direct, contradictory proof exposing her lie.    Sayonara \"I Love Sushi\" to the couple of thousand dollars we have been spending at your restaurant each year, the recommendations and referrals we have been regularly making for your restaurant, and our good will.  This is the real price of dishonesty, not $60.",

    "text": "But seriously. Five stars is what I have to give this place because well, it was friggin' tasty and the service was LEGIT as well!  We were seated at a table within 10 minutes of arriving without a reservation... And then we dove into the VERY CONFUSING MENU... While I totally would have taken a star off for the menu basically resembling hieroglyphics, the rolls we finally decided on were so good, I couldn't! What I would recommend is taking photos of ALL THE ROLLS so people can get a visual of what they're about to order- HIRE ME, and I'll do it! Ha!  Any who... Here's what I ordered (there was more ordered but I was so into making out with my own order, I didn't really pay attention!)  - Salmon Skin Handrolls (no rice, no sauce, no vegetables): This is a staple order for me, everywhere I go... If a sushi restaurant doesn't have Salmon skin, I don't go! I was VERY IMPRESSED with the portion they gave me-- typically restaurants aren't used to my type of order thus they're stingy with their salmon skin, but not this place! Oh and the skin was crunchy and pretty perfect!  - Hamachi Kama: this was a last minute decision and I'm really glad I did it because it was MOIST AND BOMB! I love the cabbage accompaniment (that doesn't have dressing) because I took bites of the meat and the cabbage together and YUM!!!   - Rock N Roll, Roll (no rice, no crab- wrapped in cucumber): this is legit what I wanted but I had to create the menu item-- as this one comes with sauce on top, rice, crab and it's wrapped in nori... But without blinking an eye, they made this roll possible and IM THRILLED cause yes please! The fish to cucumber ratio was PERFECT! And the fish was FRESH AS F!  - Seared Pepper Tuna with Avocado: I didn't order this but three plates were ordered for the table... And I'm glad I got to snag a piece, because it was SUPER TASTY! It would definitely be something I share with others though because I love Salmon 20x more than tuna!  Next time I come to Vegas, YEP- coming back here! It's not close to the strip and I'm 100% a-ok with that! When good food is on my radar, I don't care how far away it is from me!",

    "text": "This might be a biased review because I have only been here once during the hot lunch hour.  My friend and I were seated for about 15 minutes with our menus down and ready to order w/ out a peep from any of the waitresses.  I was already displeased with this considering, I had to go back to work within a certain timeframe.  I hate when lunch hours take longer than they should!  And the restaurant was not even full!  Boo!  Second, our orders took awhile to come out and we ONLY ordered 2 rolls, a salad, and an appetizer. Really?  That should not have taken very long to come out!  I was fairly disappointed.    Good thing the waitress was always apologetic.  We ordered the Garlic Chili Pepper Edamame, best edamame appetizer I've ever had.  Loved it!  We also ordered the rainbow roll; it was fresh and good tasting.  The crispy spicy tuna rice cake was amazing.  Has a nice jalapeno kick to it and definitely something I would come back for.  Their sashimi salad was ok; fish wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it, and I'm not too fond of their salty special sauce.  I might be back to try more rolls before I give up on this place.  There are just so many good sushi joints in the Southwest area to come back here.  We'll see!  Stay tuned!  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (45/365).",

Some ingredients didn't seem fresh or were overcooked. Lots of rolls to choose from, I'd probably got to SushiMon their rolls are a bit more well made, and service is better. We had to wait for drink refills a lot and they brought out all the rolls at once so the hot entrees chilled before we could eat them.",

The service was over the top even though the place was packed to the gills. We had I LOVE MY ASS ROLL as well which was awesome ! Will be back ASAP. Locals make the drive and try this place.",

Only 1 vegetable roll to choose from, & only 1 piece of it had avocado & no cucumber. I also ordered veggie tepan yaki - except the onion & there was lots of them, the rest was all green, not too visually appealing- put some variety in there.  The rice was served with the soup so definitely cold by the time my dinner was served & her combo dinner still took another 5-10 minutes. So really need better planning.  Won't be back.",

When it comes to rolls we prefer those that are spicy. Sexy Time Special, Kiss of Fire and Sun Devil are favorites. They are a must each and every time. We also enjoy the sashimi. The yellowtail is like butter. The screaming orgasm is a great alternative. We've enjoyed others, but their names escape me. Each and everyone is delicious, though. I have no doubt everything is well executed. So thankful, it's not AYCE. I much prefer quality to quantity.",

The Lisa Handroll also pictured is my favorite.    I found out about this place because an asian friend who is a waitress at another sushi restaurant told me to check it out.  Then on second thought she said \"dont go there, then you will not come back here anymore\" as it was her favorite spot also. She was right. Luckily I live close by so I can go to this place whenever i want if in the mood for high quality sushi at a very reasonable price.   The place is always busy which is a good sign! I usually go mid day so I never have to wait to long to be seated but I imagine it is slammed around dinner time.",

I even broke my \"raw only\" sushi rule and tried their 4x4 on the recommendation of a friend. Wow, was it good!  Love the atmosphere, love watching the well trained chefs perform their magic. We're never disappointed.   Sushi isn't cheap, but I feel this place gives me my money's worth.",

And they have a large variety of them. All your favorites are on the menu plus quite a few that I think they made up. If you like trying maki with crazy combos then this place is for you. If you are more of a nigiri / sashimi sushi eater then I would probably go elsewhere.  PS they have a full bar and also make some pretty decent cocktails!",

I brought my whole family to spend the lunch time together.   As soon as we got there and waited to be seated, she showed no smile and unpatiently to serve us.  Also, she was very rude to my mom who held my 2 years old daughter.  It just seemed like we owed her a lot of money.    Although we were unhappy, we tried to understand her behavior  like she probably argued with her boss this morning or got a ticket on the way home.   No, we were wrong.  She was not unhappy because she smiled to other customers except us!  Is that because we are the only asian at that lunch time?  Cannot believe that she had discrimination on asian especially she is asian too!  I assumed that the restaurant should tell the asian customers like us \"no service to you because you konw our food too much\".  Yes their food sucks as we have tried asian food for decades and they are the worst one!   We really know too much:)",

One small fault is you're handed a card to choose which roles you want to order but there is really no description. You have to ask your waitress which tends to be tedious. Now for the bad. Like many of these Asian restaurants they seem in a hurry to Get you in and out as fast as possible. This one you can expect on occasion to get your main meal first then your appetizer or both togeather. The meals don't come out all at once but are on a when ready schedule. Therefore your companion could be finishing their meal when yours is on its way out. If you accept the erratic service then you'll like this place.",

We went last night again after quite some time, and we both asked each other why we don't come here every time we are in the mood for sushi?!?!  It's not all you can eat, so the price point is a little higher. So if you're drunk and looking to eat tons and tons of food, I Love Sushi probably isn't your best bet. It's kind of nestled in the back of the shopping center with Walgreens and a Wendy's so it's not easily seen.  We always order the same roll, which I will post a picture of and it's probably the best roll I've ever had in my entire life. It has fried onions! And it's huge. If I went alone, i could only eat this roll.   The other rolls I've had were all very good also, but hands down the roll with the onions is a MUST!!  The sashimi cuts are huge. It's probably double to triple the size of what you would get at an all-you-can-eat restaurant.   Fast service, there's like 15 chefs behind the bar. The waitresses are all attentive, we had a few come up and check on us even though she wasn't our waitress. And I think the owner even came up and asked how everything was. Such a great restaurant. You MUST TRY!!",

I recommend I love sushi for people looking for a high quality meal willing to shell out the extra bucks. This place will not satisfy you if you are looking for $20 all you can eat establishment- this is not it. Their a la carte sushi rolls have a huge variety to choose from. I only noticed on my second visit some of their sushi rolls have naughty names which made me giggle. My two favorite rolls are the candy cane roll with soft shell crab and the I love sushi special roll wth regular and spicy tuna in a garlic ponzu sauce. Even though this place can be packed I always get seated and served quickly and efficiently. So far my favorite sushi place in Vegas.",

Here's what we got: - Lunch Special [comes with miso soup, salad, gyoza, tomago (sweet egg), fried rice ball]. ($15.95) You pick 2 things you want off a list of things. We picked the following choices:    -beef Teriyaki + shrimp and vegetable tempura   -chicken Katsu + shrimp and vegetable tempura   - fish tempura + vegetable tempura]  Favorite part about the lunch special was the tempura, it was so light and crispy and delicious! Very used to having cold and soggy tempura- but that was not the case as it was fresh even at non peak lunch hour :). Beef teriyaki, chicken Katsu, and fish tempura were all good- can't really go wrong with any of these three!   - Spicy Tuna Roll ($6.50) - the spicy tuna just kind of melted in your mouth! Was really happy about this. Not too overly spicy either.  - Double D Roll ($14)- a special roll with tempura shrimp and imitation crab on the inside with a salmon avocado topping on the outside. Comes with a spicy dipping sauce! Really quite good, was impressed with the freshness of the salmon, a lot of flavor to this roll- I didn't even think it needed the sauce but was a nice have anyways.  - Kaki Udon - simple udon in a soy sauce based broth. Noodles were perfectly cooked.   They have a really impressive list of rolls to choose from.Would come back for sure due to the freshness of the food/fish and to try the sashimi next time!",

    "text": "I've been coming here on and off for about six years now. For the sushi lovers, if you're looking for a a wide variety of sauced up rolls, this is the place for you. With over a hundred rolls, they hit almost every combination possible. If I'm in the mood for a roll that might not be standard at other sushi restaurants, I'll stop here. There's also some nice bento box lunch specials if your not in sushi mode.  Definitely be prepared to spend a few extra dollars. Rolls range from just under $10 to up to $15. Two rolls does me just right. Since it's not an AYCE restaurant, I usually don't get any nigiri because it would be too costly. Burning Your Stomach and Something's Wrong 69 are two tried and True rolls for me. The menu gives good descriptions of every roll so take your time and look if you've never been there, there should be something for you.  Lunch does get busy, but dinner time turns into a mad house. Your best bet is to go mid afternoon. The servers can be short and communication can be an issue, but for the most part, they get the job done. Certain servers recognize us and take good care of us.  If you'd like a little more seclusion, the booths along the walls are sort of enclosed and may be a good place to sit if you're conducting business. You'll get an order of edamame and a cucumber salad to whet the palate when you first sit down. Even though the prices are elevated, I'll continue to frequent I Love Sushi because I think they're rolls are worth it and so do the customers that pack the house pretty much every night.",

I was in the mood for some sushi too and the Screaming Orgasm along with some Uni, Yellowtail, Unagi, Salmon and beer sounded like a perfect way to end the day of chaos and stress following what happened in Las Vegas on Sunday.  We came here and we were immediately seated and offered drinks.  We then followed it up with some great food and a great time.  It was the perfect way to not think about anything but food and beer for a hour or so.  This is definitely one of the best sushi spots in Vegas and I very much recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.",

We decided on I Love Sushi thanks to the great reviews!  We went for lunch so it was pretty quiet and our food came out pretty quickly. They have a HUGE menu with lots of unique specialty rolls. We had one that was drenched in a garlic butter sauce which was absolutely horrible for us but tasted delicious.  We tried some plain nigiri and I was pleased by the quality and freshness of the fish- it was pretty fantastic. But the price was a bit high for everything we got and since I am a mega sushi pig, I want to eat a lot of sushi! Still, the interesting menu selection would be enough to bring me back for lunch or something in the future.",

I ordered a steamed shrimp roll with avocado and eel sauce on top. He ordered a shrimp tempura, tuna roll of some sort with garlic sauce and another tuna and shrimp roll. The garlic sauce on his was very overpowering but the other two were tasty. We have other favorite sushi restaurants when visiting the Las Vegas area so we'll stick with them.",

    "text": "Alright! Off season is officially over. I'm all settled in Vegas. It's time to get back to some good ole fashioned reviewing. I've got a lot of places to review but what better place to start than \"I Love Sushi\" because anyone that knows me, knows that I really LOVE sushi more than anyone!  Cozily located in a strip mall in Henderson, I Love Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas, on or off the strip. The place is always bumping and the staff is always friendly. Although some of the roll names are less than desirable (example: Tastes Like Your Ex Girlfriend...) TMI and very SCARY DUDE! Not partaking in that one right off the bat, no offense! I'd use more examples but I am unable to find a copy of their heavily sexual connotated menu online. Poking fun at their menu's items is like fishing from a barrel.  I recommend starting off with the oyster shooters. I order mine minus the quail egg. For those that are into the whole Rocky raw egg thing, have at it! You might want to even ask for my discarded ones as I've certainly discarded enough of them, although I can't guarantee they'll hook that up. Their oyster shooters set the mood quite nicely for date night. Gotta love those aphrodisiacs! Yum yum!  I typically am a creature of habit when it comes to ordering sushi so I don't mean to bore anyone after this point. I love the Philly Roll + asparagus. Even better is their \"spicy ponzu sauce\" option which is not offered elsewhere at most other sushi bars.  All in all, this place is one of the good ones. It's about as unpretentious as it gets and the quality is as good if not better as that that can be found at many of the high end strip sushi bars, without the lofty price tags. My name is Bobbi Billard and I approve of this message. I'm on a mission to become the Duchess of this restaurant... Stay tuned.",

    "text": "With sushi roll names like \"Taste like My Ex\", \"Threesome\", and \"I Love Ass\", this place is everything that Vegas is but is in the lovely neighboring city of Henderson. Yelp pro-tip, if you want to converse with your sushi chef and want real good food recommendations, I highly advise that you always take a seat at the sushi bar as opposed to a table if you can. We started off an assortment of nigiri as I tend to shy away from rolls as much as possible. Sake, Amaebi, Toro, Unagi, Uni, Ebi, Salmon Belly, etc. were all equally amazing. The Toro was like butter and according to my girlfriend, who rates sushi places based on how good their Uni was, was the best Uni that she has had since moving to Nevada. Because of the aforementioned names of rolls and the fact that they had like 60+ rolls/items on the menu, I had to try one. I ended up getting the \"Kitchen Sink\" and man was that a good choice. Literally a kitchen sink in terms of fishes in the roll and it tasted so bomb. Finally my girlfriend and I shared the baked lobster roll (no rice), which was literally all lobster and mushrooms and was also pleasantly surprisingly good as I have never had a lobster roll without rice before. All and all, it was a great experience and I will definitely come here again. Because, we were seated at the bar, I can't say too much about the service because our chef literally just hands us the food after we order. Yelp don't lie...this place is fire.",

It's so hard to go to an AYCE joint shortly after I Love Sushi, you notice a BIG difference right away.   I had frequented this place to the point of exhaustion back when I lived in Henderson. Now, living over 20 miles away, I crave it almost every month and MUST make the trip over. The variety of rolls makes it easy to find something that combines every kind of sushi you enjoy (i.e. Mistake Roll). The service is always the right mix of attentiveness and consideration. Most of all the prices are a value for the quality (but not on the lowest end of the spectrum).  My verdict is if you are looking for a great place to have sushi ESPECIALLY if you're lucky enough to be in the area, you must RUN not walk to I Love Sushi.",

There are about 1000 different rolls on their menu, many of which only vary by 1 ingredient so you really have to sit there and read what each one is (since the names help you figure out nothing in regards to what's actually inside). The names of the rolls are really tiresome and stupid... No I don't want an orgasm/penis/vulva roll. Can't sushi joints just name their rolls what they are?? It took about 15 minutes to just read everything and actually figure out what direction to go in terms of ordering. Sadly, the waitress we had spoke very little English so she was of very little help in figuring it out.   All that being said I ended up ordering a dinner special with a few different rolls on the side (no sexy orgasms or weird sauce stuff, just basic sushi rolls and nigiri - eel, salmon, tuna). The fish was very fresh, the tempura was perfect and the chicken katsu was really good!   Definitely my new favorite place for sushi in the Henderson area.",

No joke. The creativity in their rolls is uncanny, no other sushi place compares.   Second, their fish is fresh. Absolutely freshest i've had in Las Vegas.   Third, their uni shooter is heaven in a shot glass. The best mixture of uni, spice and citrus that tickle every inch of your palate.  Our go-to order is the \"Screaming orgasm\", Uni shooters, a few pieces of sashimi and a roll or two. We try to order a new roll every time we go. Definitely my favorite place to get sushi in Vegas, if not the US.",

In the meantime, I've eaten sushi all over Vegas and discovered that I Love Sushi isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  The sushi is good.  I love their oyster shooters, but their 2000 different rolls all taste the same to me.  They rely WAY too much on sauce and often I want to yell at them that simple is good too!  A nice elegant simple roll can go a long way.  The service is always great.  Sometimes I wonder if the servers are really Japanese or they just fake a thick and heavy Japanese accent to go with their beautiful Japanese costumes and restaurant decor.  The one thing I really like about I Love Sushi is the ambiance.  It is always loud and rowdy in there, unlike many sushi restaurants.  You feel like you're somewhere \"happenin\", which I love when I'm eating out.  As far as the food goes, like I said, it's just ok.  If  you are the type of person who only eats sushi and sashimi, the place is great!  But if, like me, you like a roll or two, I'd check out other spots.",

I'm not sure what everyone is ranting and raving about.   1st.- customer service: I called ahead of time and asked if I can get 1 sushi boat for my wife and I to share lady on the phone said yes and it was posted at 28 dollars or so. SHE DID NOT MENTION IT WAS 2 ORDER MINIMUM. The service was very fake not genuine at all.   2nd- taste of sushi: very average if not a little below average. We got the boat which is basically a ton of tasteless CA Rolls with a few other things.   For the price and quality I would go somewhere else. Maybe an all you can eat spot down the street.",

Not once during our meal were we asked how things were. And good luck getting your water refilled during a rush. -1 star for the owner/manager screaming everywhere. At one point, bussers were clearing out an area of the bar and the owner yelled at them from across multiple tables to stop and clean a table instead....yelling right into my ear. I watched him yell across big distances multiple times, most of those times screaming right into customers' ears. While all customers are important, he was definitely focusing on getting all the parties waiting for tables seated and not at all focused on his customers already seated and trying to enjoy a meal.   The rolls themselves were very good, imo. But it seems like the majority of rolls offered are drenched in some kind of sauce, which makes it absolutely delicious. But as my friend pointed out, the quality of the fish could be bad and you would never know because all you taste is sauce.",

There were three sushi chefs and four servers at the time.  Everything was prompt at first.  We received drinks quickly from the server and our first roll only took a few minutes.  The selection of sushi rolls was good, the food tasted good, but the service was flat awful after the first 15 minutes!   The only time the servers came by was to refill my drink (he had a large beer and a water, so his did not need refilling).  We were almost completely ignored otherwise.  One of our rolls was forgotten and our sushi chef disappeared (for about a half hour), and it was a good 15 minutes before we could get anyone's attention to find out about our roll, and service did not improve after their mistake was realized.    Furthermore, we wanted to order more drinks and dessert, but after waiting another 10 minutes for a server to come by, we just opted for the check instead.",

For the kiss of fire sushi and burning one I was hoping for their spicy to be True spicy, not just a sour taste of too much hot sauce. Overall tho friendly staff.

We were greeted right away and sat almost immediately at the bar. Sushi chef greeted us right away and we were handed small cucumber salads and edamame. After reviewing the huge selection of rolls the chef took our order. It was lightning fast. Everything was very fresh tasting and the presentation was very nice as well. Staff was attentive and filled our waters several times without us asking. Great place for a super quick dinner.",

So, once I found out about the amazing soy wrapper it changed everything for me. The seaweed wrapper is fishy to me, I didn't enjoy that. The soy wrapper is nothing, no taste, just keeps the rolls together. So now I'm able to try almost anything.   My favorite thing at I Love Sushi is the Tempura Roll. It comes with rice, avocado, cream cheese and then I substituted the eel for cooked shrimp. It's lightly battered with panko and flash fried then topped with eel sauce. It's so good. We usually get two of these because everyone always picks off my plate. My wife loves the Pho.  We always call and make a reservation. They host/hostesses always make me laugh because they make sure to remind me to be on time at least twice during the call. Reservations are key on the weekends because the waits can be relatively long.  Also, the service is always spot-on. Super friendly servers, very attentive, glass always full. They also check on you multiple times throughout the meal. Outstanding!",

Came in to the sushi bar on a busy Friday night and the Custer service was great. Ordered the Screaming Orgasm and man did I need a good one  Been way too long. The chefs special sauce is a taste explosion, nice & spicy. I had the large order which was plenty for a light eater like me. I wanted another roll to use more of the sauce. Didn't even need to though as the last call roll was flavorful in a totally different sweet way. With melted mozzarella cheese, crab, mango and eel sauce. They don't have an all you can eat special, not a happy hour. I'll definitely be coming back as the quality is second to non. This place has been here 18 years and I've only now discovered it. What a town I live in to be so spoiled with good sushi places.",

We ordered the Salmon lover (no rice), hamachi/unagi/ama ebi/sake nigiri, spicy tuna hand roll, and the Kiss of Fire roll.   All of the dishes that we got were pretty good, but none of them really stood out.  The Kiss of Fire had too much sauce for me, and that overpowered the taste of the fish. I'd come here if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't say that their fish quality was particularly exceptional. For the price that we paid, we could've gotten just as good sushi that was AYCE.   The sushi chefs and waitresses were great, and the service really made up for the food quality.",

Walking in, you're greeted and waited by waitresses/servers dressed in kimonos (cute).  It was busy going to lunch on Saturday, but there was plenty of seating.    We decided to sit at the sushi bar.  I'm not exactly a fan of sitting at a low sushi bar where I have to look up to talk to the sushi chefs.  It's just awkward.    Tuna Karai, Candy Cane Roll, and the super white tuna nigiri (ono) are what we ordered.   The Tuna Karai:  $16.50 for a bowl.  You can go to Sumo Sushi and get a Tuna Karai for $14.00 and double the amount.  This was good, but not $16.50 good.    I love softshell crab, and I'm glad that I Love Sushi has a variety of sushi rolls that include softshell crab.  I decided to try the Candy Cane Roll.  There wasn't any sauce on it.  The flavor was just okay.  It had a weird after taste to it.  It was also a bit too salty too.  Just a weird flavor.    The super white tuna nigiri (ono) was probably my favorite.  They give you a generous amount of ono sushi.  Great with a piece of wasabi and soy sauce.    Maybe I'll come back and give this place another chance in the future, but for now, it was just okay.",

Although I Love Sushi is not an AYCE restaurant, I like to go there sometimes with my wife because it is top-quality, and it's a waste of money to take her to AYCE because she doesn't even eat that much.   When we go to I Love Sushi, we always get a roll called The Kitchen Sink. It's a no rice roll and it is seriouly the bomb.   The other thing I like about this restaurant is the atmosphere. If Disney World did a sushi restaurant, it would probably look like this. All the servers are in traditional Japanese outfits and the decor is like you're in Japan. They also have real Japanese music playing in the background. I really like it.",

    "text": "*Rock N Roll-one of my all time favorite sushi rolls! Different types of fish sashimis rolled in soy paper and wrapped with a slice of cucumber. Soy paper was a substitution. I recommend this option because the soy paper is light in flavor, unlike the regular seaweed wrap which might take away from the freshness of the fish inside. This dish comes with five thinly sliced lemon slices. The lemon is for garnish but I definitely recommend eating it with your sushi. The acidity of the lemon paired up very nicely with the fish and leaves a refreshing palate craving for more. This dish only comes with 6 pieces! I wish I had ordered more. *Screaming Orgasm-comes in small and large options, sliced tuna atop of a huge bed of radish drowned in sauce. Tuna was drowning in the sauce; took away from the simplicity of the fish. This is a signature dish of the restaurant. Maybe I came on a bad day? Probably won't order the next time I come here. *Deep Fried Gyoza-I usually like my gyoza steamed then caramelized for some color and texture. But this one was too fried for my taste. Came with a side of gyoza dipping sauce. *Kiss of Fire-This dish was drenched in spicy sauce. I couldn't taste much of the contents within because the sauce was overpowering. Reminded us of a Mexican enchilada dish almost. If you do want to try this dish, ask for easy sauce. *Dancing Eel- We asked for easy sauce for this sushi roll since the Kiss of Fire roll was disappointing. The eel tasted fresh. Simple roll, nothing too special.   The decor and uniforms that the waitresses wore were very cultural. I loved every bit of it. The waitresses were super sweet and greeted everyone with a smile. They wear kimonos head to toe and have their hair in a traditional Japanese up-do. The service was excellent and they checked in with our table often to see if everything was okay and to refill our water cups.   I would definitely come back to visit again! I can't wait to try their other sushi rolls (they have plenty of variety which makes it very difficult to choose).",

Eric R. didn't think it would be a good deal since it is a la carte, and I heard it was all about pornographic-named rolls, so I wasn't expecting much.  Our friends made reservations, which we thought was weird for a local a la carte sushi joint, but lo and behold, there was a crazy wait at 7 and we skipped all of that.  The servers wore kimonos, and this place is really big for a sushi restaurant - less activity at the bar and more at tables around it.  Our server was very friendly and efficient, and we had a private-esque booth.  I got iced green tea.  Steven S. does NOT love sushi, so he ordered a dinner bento with chicken and beef.  He got brown rice for a $1 charge.  Nicole B. got udon and the cherry blossom, a non-rice \"roll\" which is really a massive amount of soft shell crab chopped up and wrapped in avocado slices.  Eric R. got the rainbow roll, ikura sushi, and had a few pieces of my nigiri order.  I went for it, and appreciated some interesting selections here.  I got hamachi, sake, saba, amaebi, uni, salmon skin temaki, and a quail egg shooter.  When I got the first pieces, salmon and yellowtail, I immediately noticed the same problem Goyemon has - HOT rice, COLD fish.  YUCK!!!!  The sushi rice was hot and not really sushi rice, which is upsetting because 1) sushi is about the rice and 2) the mixed temperatures make everything taste weird.  Not okay.  The fish quality was fine enough, though the yellowtail was splitting apart at each seam so to speak.  I liked the salmon better.  The mackerel was cured just fine and covered with my fave vegetable, green onions.  The uni was okay.  The salmon skin handroll was stuffed, and it was prepared with gobo, kaiware, cucumber, and avocado without sauce, which was very good.  The quail egg shooter had 3 quail egg yolks, masago, green onion, and ponzu which was different and tasty.  I got the amaebi last.  The sushi was good and the fried heads were enormous and covered in tempura batter.  They were on top of shredded daikon and served with ponzu.  I was very full after all of this, and I am glad I tried it finally.  However, there is no excuse for poor rice when sushi is about rice, so I do not see myself returning.",

Even our friends & family from out of town, always want to go there when they visit. Try the Pepper Tuna. If you like pot stickers, get the spicy ponzu sauce to use as dip. The spicy edamame is great too! The service is good & prices are reasonable too. Enjoy!",

I think I was successful, this is a very good sushi spot...the chefs were polite, service was fast and extremely courteous. The servers are lovely looking in traditional Japanese garments. The ambiance was done right as well. I ordered the Boom Boom nipple special and the Dragon roll. Both were delicious and I'm planning on going back for some of the other menu options before I leave Vegas. Highly recommend this spot to all who are looking for good food away from the stop.",

Jackpot Special has become the favorite of every person I bring here: including people who have been eating sushi their entire lives (unlike me who only started as an adult). I've been loving the Japanese lasagne recently and so I get the jackpot special and that and it is HEAVEN. The employees treat you so well, and it's such a clean and pretty atmosphere. They accidentally burnt my Japanese lasagne last time and when I showed up they apologized and said they were remaking it and seconds later walked out with the new one..just an example of how they won't serve anything but the best.",

For the virgins out there, it's seared ahi tuna served on a bed of shredded radish and topped with a ponzu sauce. If you're burnt out on orgasms, try the spicy, crispy rice plate, under \"fried rolls.\"   The spicy tuna and crab mixes are so good that I suggest you try them straight up in hand rolls, which are gigantor. If you're not afraid to swap saliva, buddy up on these. But do not cut them in half. I repeat, do not cut hand rolls in half. That would be like lobbing the head off of a Virgin Mary figurine.   For dessert, get the honey roll. Somehow this fried salmon roll tastes better than custard.  On top of all the sexy names and delicious sauces, the waitresses wear kimonos and repeat your order with humor, \"So, you want I love my ass?\" Yes, yes I do.",

I worship at your delicious menu and your fantastic service, and your overall Zagat awesomeness.   Sit at wooden tables and be served by wonderful ladies in kimonos equip with the shoes and all. They hand you a quick sushi list where you can check off any one of the nearly 100 sushi options they have. Don't get confused, the sushi is not listed in the folding menu, but on a stand at the end of the table. Names will make you giggle in front of your parents as you ask for \"I love my ass\" and \"Tastes like my x-girlfriend\". In fact, I sometimes have to stray from the awkward named ones because I'm almost always at sushi joints with my folks when back home. I resolved on Burning My Stomach ( which is probably sexual..somehow) and the Banzai Roll. The banzai roll is a delicious sweeter roll with teriyaki sauce wrapped in rice paper.   What really opened me up was the Burning My Stomach.  Really spicy crab meat dumped on more spicy crab and shrimp inside a roll surrounded by a thick layer of sashmi cut tuna. The flavor in this is insane. It's too big to eat in one bite, but maybe that's how you like it.   My mouth was burning so much afterward that water just made the temperature decrease from 200F to 199 F. Had to settle on a nice plum wine ice cream to give myself a break. It was perfectly sweet and tart just at the last minute that I had to eat the entire bowl, good thing I'm starting that \"diet\" next year.   I love sushi. I do. And now, I love you.",

The plain spicy tuna was \"so-so\"; the Washington role was packed full of fresh, melt-in-your-mouth salmon and the Sun Devil role nearly made me change my underwear. Personally, one of the most delicious rolls I've had anywhere.  Service is very quick and non obtrusive. Seating was immediate on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was clean. The most obvious thing I noticed was the sheer volume of sushi chefs (nearly 10) pumping out quick, quality plates at a moment's notice. Overall, a pretty outstanding place.

I cannot remember what we had but we went through about 9 rolls (all very well made by about 8 sushi guys behind the counter), also had a couple of other things like a nice lobster dish with mushrooms. Kids had teriyaki chicken, wife had tempura and teriyaki chicken entree. We will definitely go back next time in the area-we loved it. Fast service, attentive staff, great food, great prices!",

I have eaten at Shibuya (disappointing / over priced), Sushi Samba (ewww) and Social House (great restaurant but very, very mediocre sushi) but nothing comes close to I Love Sushi. My friend used to live in Henderson and when I left the strip to go visit her she would always rave about this awesome sushi restaurant in a random strip mall in the 'burbs. I was skeptical at first but she has worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years so I decided to check it out. Although this place isn't fancy I can truly say it is one of the best sushi restaurants I have eaten at. Truly a hidden gem! Everything is cheap despite the quality ingredients and innovative roles. The service is amazing and the ambiance is fun, lively and laid back. If you want a great meal and are ready to venture off the strip check out this local favorite. My amazing meal with three very hungry people was a whopping $62! Can't wait to go back next time I am in Vegas",

Yes, the sushi here is good and surprisingly fresh considering we are here in the desert and not the port of Long Beach. But the sushi business has become very competitive around Henderson and you had better be fresh or you will out of business quickly. I have seen many local sushi restaurants have the sushi come right from the airport via courier to get the freshest fish for the day. I do not know if I love sushi gets their fish this way but each time I have been there it has been fresh.  I have had bad experiences with the staff and management. One time a waitress spilled liquid on my wife's new dress. You would think there would be a voluntary adjustment on the check but I had to argue with the manager to get a few bucks off the bill for dry cleaning IF the dress could be cleaned at all. Another time the fire alarm was going off the entire time we were eating. I understand it is not the fault of the staff but an apology and perhaps a free appetizer would have been nice when the experience literally resulted in a headache.",

I call it a dive only due to the older, casual ambiance. The food and service were solid 5 star.  We overate ordering something like 12-14 rolls for 2 people. Additionally, we both had the sashimi salad. Many of the rools have too much mayonnaise or funky sauces. If you catch it upfront and request only brown rice, you can make this a healthy v hardy experience.  The sashimi salad is one of the most generous and best sashimi salads I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. I will definitely come back!",

The food was good, nothing overly impressive. A lot of spicy dishes, felt a bit like a Korea/sushi fusion type of restaurant. The screaming orgasm was very spicy and its sauce wasn't as creamy as I usually like it. I really enjoyed the kimchi roll most. The mussels were a tad dry. The place itself was packed, we ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table and the loud noise from so many people crowded in such a small space made it difficult to relax and converse. The decorations created a nice atmosphere with a lot of red and black, paper screens and painted lanterns. Staff was friendly and our waitress was spectacular despite the crowd - great attitude, on top of our drinks, and kept track of what food we were still waiting on better than I could. Overall, a good experience and, although it won't be my go-to sushi place, I would go back again.",

Back in 2010 I went here for my friends birthday and tried sushi for the very first time, and I was in love. The chefs put so much love and craft into each roll, it's no wonder this place is one of the best to go to for sushi in Las Vegas. After trying many different rolls I tried the Crunch Roll and it has always stuck. It's actually what I compare other rolls to to decide how good it actually is. I've yet to find one in Reno that is as delicious as the Crunch Roll. I finally got to come back to I love sushi for the first time since 2012 when I moved and it felt like coming home. Nearly everything was the same, including quality of sushi and exceptional service. Ofcourse I got a Crunch Roll, and ofcourse it lived up to my expectations. I wish I love sushi had an all you can eat option, but I never expect that to happen.",

The whole atmosphere is really cool as well. I've heard people say its kinda cheesy but I enjoy it.   But I wouldn't recommend going if you're right on funds as they are expensive.  Also make sure if you're a Vegetarian and asking for teriyaki they give you teriyaki and not eel sauce. One of the guys argued with my friend one time saying that they're the same thing because he didn't jut wanna walk to the kitchen and grab teriyaki for her or ask a waitress to or something.",

    "text": "Went here for my birthday dinner on a Saturday night with some friends.  I have heard things from friends here and there and I like to try new sushi spots, so I decided to give this a go from that as well as Yelp reviews.  -;)  No reservations and we were still able to get a party of 8 seated in about 10 minutes at 8 PM on a Saturday night, which was fantastic.  The older Asian man in the embroidered cowboy shirt and riding boots was nice and efficient.  We ordered after much debate (and apparently a menu-stealing waitress from what a friend said) and the food came pretty fast.  That might be relative to enjoying great company with friends, I'm not 100%.  Their Homare Strawberry Nigor (strawberry sake) is $16 a bottle - not bad as Island Sushi's is $20.  I drank most of it.  (Hey, it was my birthday dinner.)  I got two staples in my sushi ordering - crunch roll and dragon roll.  Both were good but not the best I've had.  The crunch on the crunch roll was not what I'm used to - it was fairly hard and not the normal light, panko batter that I've experienced at other places.  The dragon roll had a bit too much sauce, but the eel slices on top were generous.  My friend ordered a spicy roll with a jalapeno slice on top (can't remember the name) so we sushi-swapped and hers was great!  I had to eat one roll in two bites.  They are VERY generous with the fish cuts, which is great because they are also high-quality.  The tempura I tried from my friend's Love Boat was good but slightly reminded me of my crunch roll - that harder crunch instead of the light fluff of normal panko.  Service was very friendly and they brought out a complimentary tempura ice cream with a candle.  That was very tasty - the pound cake inside was soft, fluffy, and very melt-in-your mouth - but I was pretty full by that point so I only ate half.  Plus: LOTS of cooked choices for groups that enjoy Japanese food but not sushi. (Those crazies.)  Minus: No AYCE.  I came with an AYCE-friendly group, and since they are my normal sushi crew I probably won't be back for awhile.",

I Love Sushi has at least 90!!! My husband and I's favorite is the Jackpot Special and we get it every single time we have dinner there. My friend was right about this place, the food and fish is very fresh!! If you're thinking about trying this place out, don't think twice, just go - you won't be disappointed. Get a good buzz going too, try their cold Raspberry sake. Btw, the service is good too!! They get pretty busy and packed during dinner time but it's usually not that long of a wait and it's always worth it to me.. The waitresses are very nice and the chefs are fun!

But there just isn't anything about this place that makes it \"a great deal\" or \"worth the high price.\" But the food, for the price, is just average. It's basically, exactly what you expect to get for the price you pay.  The options here are neverending. Seriously, the roll menu is HUGE. With so many different rolls, there's going to be something you like, no matter what your tastes are.  If you're a lover of fresh fish, definitely try the screaming orgasm, it is so yummy.   This place would be 5 stars if it was just slightly cheaper. While the fish is definitely good, I've also had a ton that's better quality for the same prices. And I guess that is I Love Sushi's fatal flaw: it has, ever so slightly, over-priced itself.  The prices are about average for a sushi place, but definitely not on the cheap side. If you're the kind of person who has sushi multiple times per week, you're better off finding a slightly less expensive place. For the occaisional sushi night, though, this place is perfect and you will leave happy.",

    "text": "I love I Love Sushi! Their prices are very reasonable and their service is outstanding. They are attentive without being pushy, and your glass never comes close to being empty. I had a dinner special with beef rib eye teriyaki and tonkatsu. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and tender, the tonkatsu was breaded and fried so it wasn't overly crisy, and the pork was juicy. The salad, miso soup, and gyoza that was included was excellent as well. The coolest thing about their dinner special was their tempura rice. I have never seen anything like it and i was pleasantly surprised when i bit into it. The rolls my GF ordered were tightly rolled and filled with delicious raw cuts of fish and the sashimi she ordered was nicely cut and very fresh.   It doesn't get any better that I Love Sushi for your sushi fix in vegas. The only thing that could possibly make this place better is an \"all you can eat\" option.",

Though i though i had given up forever on sushi, i was wrong.  They have some pretty inventive rolls  like, \"who's your mama?\" \"who's your pimp?\" \"whats your ex-wife?\" funny names like that.  The chefs are all young, which doesnt mean anything, but i cant hep but wonder if they helped in the sushi naming. The bento box lunch specials are very reasonable, stating at $7.95.  comes with salad, miso, rice, a little pouch of something filled with sweet rice, sweet tofu (i think), and two pot stickers. anyways...probably the only sushi place ill return to when i come here again.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  good sushi, tempura and teriyaki.  i would be more elaborate, but for sushi night my mom wanted to go here and i didnt...so at no fault of their own, i was in no good mood.  I ordered tempura which was average.  My brother ordered teriyaki chicken, which he enjoyed very much.  My mom got sushi, and then we all split a spider roll, which i found to be very tasty.  minus a star because the service was so so...had to wait for some time for our drinks to be refilled, though it was a busy night and somewhat loud...",

Real busy so when the waitress finally comes order everything you will ever want. If you sit at the bar the sushi chef closest to the front is abrupt, engaging, and hilariously inappropriate. The chefs love to cat call fine honeys that walk in. Loud and cool. You'll hear people having sake-bombs. Not AYCE. Gourmet rolls can be greasy. I have too many favorite rolls to list. Parking usually is a pain. Bring your white friends. They will feel comfortable because their brethren are primary clientele. Lots of things to look at so if you have nothing to say to your food companion it will not be weird. Be ready to wait forever for your check.",

Hands down I have to say that I love Sushi takes the cake when it comes to quality and quantity. Although it is a bit pricey this place is definitely one of the best in town. They are definitely known for their outrageous names and service. I've come here many times for a causal dining experience, a girl's night out, and a group event. Each time I was never disappointed. If your are in Vegas and want to take a look at how the locals live....take a drive to I love Sushi.  The only bad thing I would have to say is I don't like the location, it's a bit far up South going towards Anthem. I'd prefer a centrally located place, but I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles....",

A buddy of mine who lives out here showed me one of two spots where the locals come for some incredible sushi without the outrageous price on the strip.   The interior is amazing.  I felt like I was transported back in time to a Japanese Tea House. I didn't realize how big it was.   I tried the Kiss of Fire (they warned me several times of how hot it was).  Incredible and very flavorful (Having a taste of the exotic and spicy), I didn't flinch.  My buddy had a couple rolls that I tried and I have to say it was damn good.  I can't say enough about this place.  Staff, Service, ambience.  Great place for a date.  Get out of the main casino strip and try the local spots if you can.  You'll save change and try some amazing rolls and Sashimi that's hard to beat.",

My favorite roll is I Love My Ass and Spring Mt Roll. Another good item is the Screaming Orgasms and i usually ask them not to sear the tuna I think its a lot better that way.",

The rolls all pretty much were the same rolls on the menu,but named different things,looked the same when they came out and were WAY over priced. I live downtown Vegas and drove here because I was on a date, I think I would be much better off at an all you can eat sushi joint on Flamingo,rather than drive to Timbucktoo and pay out the butt for mediocre sushi. The sushi chefs however were very entertaining while chugging booze with the people at the sushi bar and making everyones sushi. That was a plus with the entertainment there.",

It's just quality, consistent, and delicious. I didn't think I was going to give a 5 to anywhere for a while but when I started to try and pick it apart I couldn't really say anything bad about it. They are fast with their service, but not too fast. The dishes are always delivered exactly the same. The food quality is always very high. The fish is very fish. Prices are reasonable.  If there was a 4.5 stars I would have considered that one just because of the decorations. It is nice, but based on the volume and quality of the place, it could use a little facelift to reflect the True quality of who it is. It's not bad, its clean, its just a little old and tired looking. But that would not distract from going.  If I want American style sushi, this is the spot. If I want more authentic Japanese sushi I always go to Miko's Izakaya. Two totally different styles. Both best in class.",

I have been going here for years and love that there is no \"all you can eat\" option - just a diverse menu full of high-quality fish. The chefs are trained well and present the dishes in a nice fashion. I love that they give you free edamame and cucumber salad when you sit at the bar. My favorite rolls are the Tempura Roll and Japanese Lasagna. I ordered the Boom Boom Nipple Special last night and it was pretty good, however I was not really into the fish mix tempura that went along with that. Other than that, I always have a superb experience dining here. Highly recommend!",

Now, I've been called a lot of things in my life, mostly Macauley Culkin, but I have NEVER been called James Dean for the indisputable fact that I plain and simple don't look like the Rebel Without A Cause. However, after doing a few shooters and sake bombs with the chefs, I truly did feel like Dean and we joked and joked about it until I walked to my car and let someone else drive so I didn't actually end up like the late actor (faceplanted into the pavement.)  Joking aside, this sushi is the best in town. I've never been disappointed by a visit and every time I try something new and have a new favorite roll. Some of my favorite menu items include the Bonzai Roll and the Yellowtail Sashimi. The flavors of each are top notch and so fresh.   Lunch specials are very affordable and include a buttload of food.

We all seemed to try something we usually don't get just to see how we liked it and we were very pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was.

I order the spicy edamame right off the bat. Soooo good, and spicy! A Screaming orgasm is a MUST! i can handle a small on my own or I'll order a large to split with my date. Joe is my favorite sushi guy when i get there at night. If i go too early I'll miss him, but the other guys are pretty attentive and friendly. I always see someone i know there so i know this place has to be pretty popular. Every once and a while i will make a friend there. To all you newbies, i guarantee this will be your new hot spot! But prepare to wait for a table if you show up during prime time which is usually around 7. This place is poppin ny then. Totally worth the wait though.",

Just note its Americanized Japanese food - not Japanese Japanese, if you know what I mean. The winner of the night was the teriyaki halibut that was steamed. We were warned that it would take a while to cook and it was worth it. The sauce was on the sweet side, but the fish was surprisingly light and not overcooked. Scallop roll was the best, poke was passing and the shrimp tempura in the caterpillar roll was pretty greasy, and again had really sweet sauce. I have to admit I blushed a bit as I read the sushi menu while sitting across from my grandma. Screaming orgasm roll? Really? Good thing it was dark so she probably couldn't read the menu or see my red cheeks.",

I didnt know what to expect especially from a place called I Love Sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. Boy we're we surprised. This place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I think the place seats about 200 easily. Wow. The food was awesome. AWESOME. The rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. I guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Taste Like My Ex Girlfriend, Fat A$$ Special, and so forth. Regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. Even though the names and description mention \"special chef sauce\", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. I read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. Here's a list of rolls we had:  (Check out the pictures I added to the I Love Sushi page. Warning: May cause a craving for some Sushi!)  Jackpot Roll - I dont remember the exact description but its a fried tempura roll with spicy mayo sauce. Spider Roll - Soft Shell Crab Screaming Orgasm - Seared Tuna in chef special sauce Fat Ass Roll - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce. I Love Sushi Special - Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauce Double D roll - Raw Salmon and tuna on a roll and then into the yummy sauce Dragon Roll - Lotsa lotsa Unagi.

Here it is in Japanenglish:  \"I went to I love sushi where 2 friends have been attached, but we received just one menu. As for me I that because I am the food central, yelpers service and atmosphere of the restaurant, and so on remainder when it adjusts the focus, must say that the fact that you make be irritated is found: As for bad service it was and others, but was to let stand and the food left, if you blow, me everything is directly forgotten. As for me the weight less failure which gives three menus to us with such reason so presumes that you make be irritated -- The fish of I love sushi the good quality, but what approximately obtains your panty of the bundle, is.  \"In addition as for me when the place of the sushi the wind change giving name in the roll, that like the characteristic roll of the destruction of duplication Doggstyle rather than being lovely, the margin which is rubbed the fact that you are troubled is found. But because I at all do not think the possession some kind of fish and the raw materials form the DDBS roll, but for failing the trial of the restaurant which gives the impact which is not, enjoys. And these retardedly of the menu it seems like 200 of the roll which is shown, therefore I order to speaking to my friend exactly, description finish the fact that book-reading of 30 parts is used in the change which is obtained. When you think plus, that we would like to inspect the characteristic position which has sexual intercourse don't I go exactly with Internet? You do not entreat the sushi pornography exactly.  \"...

Go somewhere.\"  And here it is in regular-old English:  \"I went to I Love Sushi with two friends, but the waitress only gave us one menu. I have to say I find it irritating when yelpers focus too much on a restaurant's service, ambience, etc, because I'm food-centric: bad service is frustrating, but all is soon forgotten if the food blows me away. I guess that's why the waitress' failure to give us 3 menus was so vexing -- the fish at  I Love Sushi is of an ok-quality, but nothing to get your panties in a bunch about.   \"I also find it annoying rather than cute when Sushi places give their rolls wacky names, like Double Doggstyle Breakup Sex Roll. But not because of the restaurant's failed attempts to shock and amuse, but because I have no fucking idea what kind of fish and ingredients make up a DDBS Roll. And there's like 200 of these retardedly-named rolls on the menu, so I end up spending a half-hour reading the descriptions instead of just ordering and getting back to talking to my friends. Plus, if I wanted to check out fucked-up sexual positions wouldn't I just go on the internet? Sushi-porn just ain't appealing.  \"...Oh shit...looks like I've lapsed into griping more about the restaurant than the food itself. What a shit I am! Don't read this review!

    "text": "It's a party in your mouth.   I LOVELOVELOVELOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!! This is the best sushi I've ever had in my life. Everything about I Love Sushi is amazing, the sushi, miso soup, the restaurant, the menu, the sexual/hilarious names they think up for the sushi rolls (Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend, Screaming Orgasm, I Love My Ass, etc..), the waitresses, the chefs, the bar, the booths, the tables, the service, the prices, everything! I dream about their sushi and plum saki everyday. The softness of the rice, the way they pack in the many versatile ingredients that go into each roll, how at first bite you just sit back and realize that you've been missing out on a big chunk of life in food world. Mmm.. I can still taste it in my mouth.  The restaurant is lit just right to be romantic and bright enough to see what you're eating, who you're talking to, and occasionally check out the hot chef with the Japanese flag as a bandana behind the sushi bar (i love you, super sexy chef). The service is phenomenal, everyone working there is Japanese, even the waitresses, and I had to keep from laughing when our graceful, polite waitress who looks like she's never said a cuss word in her life repeated our order to us, \"2 Screaming Orgasms, One roll of Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend, one Ricky Roll and one roll of I Love My Ass with plum saki\". It still makes me laugh just thinking about it.  I once drove from L.A. to Henderson, Nevada just to eat here. My absolute favorite roll is the Ricky Roll. I give this restaurant a bajillion stars, this place will definitely get you some, and I'm gonna dream about their sashimi tonight.",

I wish they had a drive thru.  Anyhow, I normally don't eat rolls, but I couldn't resist looking at their extensive list of over 80 rolls.  So I gave it a try... Each night, I picked a different one and was not disappointed.  They have some crazy names and mix of a lot of types of fish.  One of my favorites was Eddie's special that had both spicy tuna and spicy scallops on top of a crunch roll.  It was soooo good.  I also tried their amaebi and uni... on Monday, the pieces were small but by Friday the pieces were bigger and meatier.    Thank you I Love Sushi for supporting my sushi addiction.",

THE UNI IS FRESHHHHHHHH! yellow, fluffy and sweet.  my bf really likes the \"i love my ass roll\". it is super white tuna and spicy tuna,soft shell crab with a special brown sauce... i think it is sesame w/ a hint of mustard seed.  super good... i also get the rolley rice bowl with uni and scallop. this is a masago rice bowl mixed with scallop and topped off with some fresh uni. its like a very fancy chirashi bowl.  i also really like the kanpai roll. it is a yellowtail roll, w/ shrimp tempura, avocado and a ponzu sauce. its raw and yummy.  i love this place. i frequent here at least once a week. highly recommended to others!",

    "text": "Yuck! I ordered kiss of fire sushi roll 2 nights ago. I have had this before here and it was always good, this time they literally dumped so much sauce on it that it was almost impossible to pick up the sushi with the chop sticks and it ruined the taste of it for myself and my daughter. The waitress would not leave me alone about it when I sent it back saying \"is it too spicy?\" I told her @ least 5 times \"no, it is absolutely soaked in sauce and it sort of turned my stomach\" I told her I did not want anything in place of it. Again, she was so pushy so I finally said \"okay just give me the same sushi roll with the sauce on the side!\" My Gosh! Enough was enough I told her no so many times, please leave me alone! Anyway, when the sushi roll came back with no sauce on it I wish I would have thought to take a photo of it. We both took one bite of it and could not take anymore. The sushi was far from fresh. Pale in color and tasted like old rotten fish. Needless to say we left the entire roll - paid our bill and will never return to \"I love sushi\" again. There is a sushi restaurant on every corner and I recommend you pass go on this corner. Not only do they NOT listen to their customers but when their sushi is getting old they obviously dump tons of sauce on it to mask the decaying taste. Yuck! Just thinking about it turns my stomach.",

    "text": "Amazing!!  Upon arriving in Vegas, our family brought us here for the \"best sushi ever\".  Could this be True? We were soon to find out!  The restaurant was crowded, very lively, and luckily we had a reservation so we got right in.   Our cousin is pretty much a sushi snob, so he ordered all our entrees. We started out with saki to salute our dining adventure. First on the menu was the Screaming O (seared tuna with mayonnaise sauce on a bed of radish). It was pure delight!!  I highly recommend it! Next we had garlic albacore & garlic tuna. Both fantastic. Next up Kiss of Fire and Who's Your Daddy (both on the spicy side). They were definitely crowd pleasers. Last entree was The Grand Canyon Roll - a great finish to the meal.  Everything was very fresh, good temperature contrast and great presentation.   We discovered that they had Green Tea Tempura ice cream and we were full but just couldn't resist. We devoured it!!  We had a great experience and it stands up to the hype!! It's no joke!",

Didn't give them that extra star because they can workout their spicier rolls better. They make them all large and pile on lots of stuff therefore the sushi falls apart and the spicy sauce theres so much of it, I feel like I'm drinking it. Meh.   But I've been here at least 15 times so its mostly always a good experience. Cant please us everybody all the time :-)  Also I saw a review before...some lady talking about quality of the sushi? Firstly...lol Second, the quality is just fine considering its just a regular local spot.   Anybody know a place around here with GREAT quality for this kind of price? Please let me know then! Id love to go there.",

We ordered the following rolls a flower roll (which is tuna, yellowtail, salmon with some tempura shrimp, massage and avocado in a spicy ponzu sauce. Great roll and the server said it was the #1 seller! Delicious! Then a Grand Canyon roll which is from the kitchen and warm with scallops, shrimp, mushrooms, masago and green onion over basically a California roll. Then two orders of negi Hama and 2 spicy scallops hand rolls in soy paper! Those were amazing as well. Super full of fish not all rice! Great job we will be back!",

It's the sort of name you find on a place that has sketchy fish and a terrible menu.   Fortunately, we have Yelp to nudge us into giving a place like this a chance, and I'm so glad we did. The menu is huge. There are literally over a hundred rolls listed (in addition to the usual appetizers, sushi, nigiri, etc.). Quality was outstanding. Service was a bit awkward for us, but I think it's more because they have their own thing going on and we hadn't figured it out. Whatever, if the food is great we can overlook some other issues. We'll certainly be back.",

If you don't really care about the sushi quality and you're more into fancy roll, and maybe you don't really like fish that much then this is probably the place for you and that's OK. I'm just saying for a superficial love her and somebody that's going strictly for the quality and I really don't care what the restaurant looks like this was not the place for me. Also because they are so busy I think they're understaffed and it took probably 35 minutes just to get a glass of water-not super impressed to say the least. They did seat is quite fast though so that is a plus also they have these little private-ish areas to eat your sushi and I think that's pretty cool too.",

The servers and managers learn who you are when you come often so you truly do feel at home. It's casual in decor and comfort.  Food: sometimes we ravage our food so quickly that we don't remember the names of what we ordered! We do remember enjoying a 80% something and a sex on the beach and a mistake something lol. There's raw and baked and cooked rolls for everyone to try! We love getting \"easy rice\" so there's not as much rice cramping our style tasting the fishy deliciousness! There's also great calamari! The drinks selection includes just enough house wine and beer and sake selection to get you through your meal.   I love Sushi makes Sushi to order that's quick and amazing and perfect to get your fix!",

We love the lady's wearing the kimonos what a great look... Seating is very comfortable and after being seated they bring cucumbers marinated to your table on the house... The fish is fresh by taste and their menu is great, our favorite is the screaming O, yellow tail jalapeno, and garlic butter special. The sake list is great and priced to match.   Over all: Like I said one of my top two favorite spots in town, between the menu & fresh fish I believe this place sells itself. The price is moderate and when walking out they have my favorite old school candy (the root beer wrapped candy)   Thank you I Love sushi for always making date night good!",

The waitresses try to be quick but it's almost kind of feels like they're rushing you, no big deal though I get it. But anyway, I pretty much enjoyed everything we ordered that day except for my Screaming O, I asked the waitress if they could slightly sear it a little more than normal. She brought it back basically cooked all the way so that was ruined. As for the sushi rolls the Kitchen Sink was probably one of my favs! Order it! You will not regret it!! My friend also ordered the Baked Lobster (no rice), that was amazing!! The Garlic Butter Special was mediocre and the Japanese Lasagna was pretty good. The other rolls my friends got, they said it was all delicious! I believe a few of the other rolls were the Johnny Roll (no rice), Johnny Special, and the Monkey Roll, there were plenty more but I can't recall the exact ones. I definitely want to come back and try other things on the menu and for that Kitchen Sink roll!",

    "text": "The first thing I noticed about this restaurant when we drove into the lot was how big the sign was and then how big the restaurant was.  It's a big place and I highly recommend it for big groups!  They even have big booth like sections for parties of 6.  FOOD: Kiss of Fire ($13): Spicy crab, tempura shrimp, cucumber, soft shell crab, albacore & jalapeno topped with extra spicy ponzu sauce.  I tasted more lemon than anything else in this roll.  Maybe it should've said \"extra lemony ponzu sauce\" on the menu instead.  I Love Sushi Special ($11.50): Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauce.  This was probably my favorite roll of the night! They were very generous with the tuna.  It's got a kick but it's bearable.  Crazy Horse Roll ($8): Smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onion & deep fried with eel sauce.  This is an excellent choice for those who don't like raw fish.  It's creamy and sweet!  Fat Ass Special ($13): Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce.  My friends & I giggled when they repeated our order and when they brought it out: \"Here is the fat ass\".  HAHAHA!  This is a wide roll so you can't actually get all the fish in one bite.  Without dipping your roll in the surrounding sauce, it wouldn't be too spicy but if you drench it, you'll feel a good kick.  Green Tempura Ice Cream: They swirled the bottom of the bowl with chocolate syrup.  The tempura was more cake like than crispy but that's up to the restaurant's choice really.  The green tea ice cream was actually a little bland.  RECOMMENDED FOR: ROLL LOVERS!  Don't get all food critic-like on this place because this ain't the time.  Enjoy a long list of out-of-the-box rolls, crazy names & lots of sauce!",

I feel like once I find the rolls I like at I Love Sushi, this will be the place.. but I'm still searching.  I haven't settled on one I really like yet.  I am really not happy with the caliber of affordable sushi to be had in L.V.  (Of course the super pricey places on the strip like Nobu are amazing, but who can eat there once a week?) - All you can eat sushi is never as good a quality as regular a'la cart sushi. And every place I find here in L.V. is all you can eat!  It's something with the consistency of the rice and the quality of the fish.  I Love Sushi has quality fish.  Now if I can find one of their rolls that's similar to my favorite Jak Sal roll at my old Cali place I can finally settle down to a regular joint that I can visit weekly.",

BUT, I was drawn to the \"Tuna Poki\" option on the menu, and I love poke (note the spelling difference).  I've learned since then that Korean \"poki\" is slightly different from Hawaiian \"poke\".  That doesn't mean it was bad - it just wasn't my thing.  So I suppose this is my warning to poke lovers.  I also had some salmon-avocado sushi.  That was good.  Not the best salmon I've ever had, but pretty good.  I sat at the sushi bar and service was outstanding.  It better be; there's like 16 guys running around behind the bar cutting fish, so whatever you order, you get it pretty quick.  I did get accidentally charged for a Mexican roll that the people next to me had ordered, but the mistake was fixed very quickly once I pointed it out.  Always check your bill, kids!  Some raw fish and a bomber bottle of Asahi and I was very happy by the time I left.",

I have to admit that I hated the name of the restaurant, and almost didn't go because I thought it couldn't be good...that would have been a huge mistake.  I will tell you, we put this place through the test. We ordered several rolls, salmon sushi, and a variety of other items.

He's been a fan of sushi since he was 7 so who am I to argue?  LOL.    I'm hooked.  We ordered 10 different items and just layed them on the table smorgasbord style.  Wow.   The Japanese Lasagna is great but I would recommend sharing it cuz it's very rich as was the Orange Bowl, no rice - excellent! .  I particularly like the Mistake roll, D.C. Roll, Franky's special  and the Yum Yum Roll.  Everything was terrific but those were my favorites. Had something called Joe's Special and Johhnie's Special roll and like them as well.   I especially like the cucumber salad they served as we sat down.  My younger grandson doesn't eat sushi but ordered a plate of Pot Stickers and loved them.    I have nothing to compare this place to foodwise but I know that everything I tried was excellent and very well prepared.   Had to bring home a couple of containers of their pickled ginger and the wasabi is REALLY over the top good.   The service was great but I have to admit we got there early in the evening.   The ambience is Japanese right down to the kimoni type dress the waitresses were wearing.  Gave a nice touch to the whole ethnic scene.    My  highly experienced sushi loving friends are happy that I'll be joining them from now on and they recommend I Love Sushi also.   Gotta go with the flow on this one.",

Went here last night around 8:30pm.. and ordered yellow tail hamachi ... three pieces .. the first piece tasted just ok(not good) , the second piece tasted bad.. the fish had a rough / hard texture in the center and it didn't taste right.. didn't taste fresh, so I stopped eating it .. I woke up sick at 4am and have been sick all day so far :(  Also the atmosphere was very obnoxious last night.. there was a table of 6 people in their early 20s who kept ordering saki bombs which was amusing to watch at first but they quickly got wasted and started yelling and laughing during the entire visit .. my guest and I couldn't even hold a conversation cause they were screaming in our ears and we couldn't hear each other talk .. and they kept yelling the F word .. which doesn't offend me directly but I had my 5 year old son with us and looked around at other families with their kids too and no one seemed to be enjoying the loud obnoxious atmosphere .. the staff was very friendly .. as always .. they were doing shots with the loud table which was again amusing to watch.. if those kids could control themselves it prob wouldn't have been a problem but they were annoying AF .",

Never been given this at ANY sushi place I've been to. That right there grabbed my attention. We arrived right when they opened so they were still getting ready. For waiting 5 minutes they brought out edmame. You can see that they want to make their customers happy.  They have quite the variety of rolls from baked to deep fried to regular rolls. If you're looking for something w/ some kick try the Kiss of Fire. The mountain blast is another good one to try. Most of the rolls do have some sauce that come on them. The price is typical, the service is great, & the food is awesome!",

It is \"Americanized\" sushi in an \"authentic\" environment.\" (if that makes any sense) There are lots of unique rolls of which I highly recommend the \"cherry blossom\" and the \"screaming orgasm!\" It is Korean owned but you will be greeted in Japanese. lol The TVs in contrast are always set to American sports. The waitresses are  adorable, dressed in kimonos, and are very helpful once you figure out how to communicate what you want. Good service, amazing food and reasonable prices consistently make \"I love sushi\" worth the 15 minute drive off the Las Vegas Strip.",

    "text": "I love sushi is a great place to grab some sushi. Everything on the menu is really good. I try and have it once a month, because of how good their sushi is. My favorite roll is ryan's special. If you like spicy you should try the kiss of fire which is really good, but spicy. The spicy garlic edamame is really good and my favorite. Every roll I have tried at I Love Sushi has been really good. Everything on the menu has a unique name that I have not heard anywhere else. Their fish is always fresh and tastes great. For dessert their green tea tempura is really good and my favorite ice cream. Besides sushi they have other great choices of food.   They are always busy on weekends, but the wait is never too long. The owner is really nice and a good friend. Since me and my family always go here the owner knows us really well and sends us free sake most the time. The staff is really nice and efficient. They also have take out which is good, but you have to remember to put the sauces on the sushi as it is separate. The service is always great, even on busy days. The sushi never takes long to be served.   I would recommend I love Sushi to anyone who likes sushi. I'm a big sushi fan and I Love Sushi has to be my favorite place to get some sushi. Great place to have sushi and try for your first time. All their items on the menu are really good and I have not had something at I Love Sushi that I have not liked. Everyone I have taken to I Love Sushi for the first time has loved it and is now a regular customer there.",

I usually get it with Tempura, and Chicken Katsu.  It also comes with Miso, Salad, Egg, Rice, Beancurd Sushi.  I know I'm leaving something out, but I've never seen such a huge bento box.  The dinner combos go up a little bit in price (I think it's $13-14 dollars), but they give you about twice as much Tempura, as well as cucumber salad, regular salad, gyoza, some sort of Tempura fried rice ball.  Again, tons of food for the price.  Another good thing to order here are the teppanyaki plates for about $14.  My girlfriend usually gets the Ribeye one, and it's pretty much just tons of meat, zucchini and onions.  They're served with Ponzu, and another sauce to dip the meat/veggies in.  They also come with Miso, and salad.",

Eating sushi at a place called 'I love Sushi' in a shopping complex behind a gas station you say? Standby while I check my notes please. Sorry gf san, the answer is no. BUT I love sushi and I needed my fill so we tried it anyway. Since then this has become our go-to spot. We love the ambiance, we love the food and we love the kimono-wearing ladies cursing in Japanese (just kidding!).  The food's all good. While the sashimi isn't the best I've ever had, it's good enough. Their special rolls are delicious (not to mention creatively-named). The crunch roll and spicy tuna roll somehow always find their way into our order. The lunch specials are ok and I can honestly say I've had better bento box lunches. But if you're eating the bento here you're doing yourself a disservice. Have the real deal - the sushi and sashimi rolls. Finish off with the awesome green tea tempura icecream!",

After reading the reviews, I ordered the Screaming Orgasm and 69 dish (forgot the whole name) because they got such great reviews but they were a total disappointment. I have had a lot of sushi in my time, and some of the best I've had were at small litle places, so I'm pretty open-minded, but this was nothing to write home about.

Not only does it provide us a break from the chaos of the Strip, but the food here is fantastic! You will Definitely get far more value for your money here than on the Strip.  If you do come, you have to try the Ika Tempura!  We had 2 orders last night.  Crispy on the outside, and soft, but slightly firm (as it should be) on the inside!  Yum!   The staff is almost alarmingly attentive!  (unlike trying to get any kind of service in the Strip Casinos) It goes without saying, but I will anyway, that the Sashimi is top notch!  The pieces of fish, etc, are gratifying of sufficient size as to make them visible/identifiable to the naked eye...not always the case (these days) If you need a delicious break from the Strip, and your tastes turn toward sushi, you really should try this place.  I Love Sushi is (probably) a Franchise...this particular one is the BEST that we've found!",

    "text": "I really love the sushi here. It's a very modern, Americanized, sushi experience. However, the quality of fish is excellent so if you're in a more traditional sushi mood you will enjoy the toro, yellowtail, albacore, and salmon. But if you're ready to utilize all of your taste buds they have some of the most delicious and creative rolls in the city. \"I love my ass\" and \"tastes like my ex girlfriend\" are favorites of mine, but I would highly recommend starting with a spicy tuna hand roll. When I lived in Vegas I was a regular here, and when I come back to visit I try to make a point to hit this place at least once.",

They should lessen the variety and stick to pictures menu so one can see how it looks like.  Their nigiri sushi are simple for a 4 dollar plus a plate.

I could be in middle of chewing my food and my plate was taken away from me       I ordered multiple orders of salmon belly and decided to order a beer. At that point I was asked is that the only thing you're going to order a seven belly over and over? Who cares I asked questions about what sushi you have and I told Jose knew that you are obviously upset that I'm ordering the same thing which I know is safe. O   I will not recommend this place to anybody nor will I ever be back.   I work in the food industry, I serve people day in and day out.

The next day I would come back for lunch or dinner. I would order extra to take home. I would eat the sushi next day when it was half as good, yet somehow still delicious.  Here's what to get if you're like me, a fan of spicy tuna:  Spicy Tuna Hand Roll - do not get the cut roll unless you're a baby who can't bite into mouthfulls of high quality raw fish.  Kitchen Sink Roll - the debate here is rice or no rice. My personal preference is no rice(you get more crab).  No Mistake Roll - good for people who only eat California rolls and looking to venture out to real sushi.  Sushi boats are great for special occasions!",

    "text": "There was a evening event that I had participate in at I Love Sushi. Our reservations were for a Monday night at 5:30 P.M.  I Love Sushi is located in Henderson, near the end of Horizon Ridge Parkway. It was about 45 minute drive for me, located out in the NW location of Las Vegas.  Sushi is complicated for me at times. I decided to opt for a few different items from I Love Sushi with several members.  [1] Chicken Udon [1] Dinner - 2 meat - meal [1] Poke Bowl [1] Order of Tuna Sushi type  Complimentary, on the house, Edamame was brought to the table [2]. The service I felt was relatively rude. The waitress would just drop our entrees on the table, without saying a \"Hi\" or \"who ordered this\" or anything. We had to shuffle a few items around to the people whom ordered certain dishes. Even after our meals were served, we were not followed up for any re-fills on drinks [etc.] except for the bill.  The Chicken Udon was okay. I thought it had been sitting in the back for awhile as it tasted like the noodles were slightly cold and starting to congeal with the broth.   The dinner [2] meat was pretty good. The Chicken and Beef teriyaki was scrumptious, both not overcooked and packed a ton of flavor! One of my favorite dishes, was what seemed like their fried rice cake, covered in a teriyaki based sauce. It was really good. I would just come back to I Love Sushi for that dish again.  The Poke Bowl was okay. My boyfriend, whom ordered it, mentioned that the Tuna was really fresh, but the rest of the ingredients in the bowl was just fillers. He also liked the Tuna Sushi.  I don't think I'll be back to this restaurant any-time soon. The bill was relatively pricey for all [4] orders, approximately $80.00 and the customer service was really poor.",

They also don't skimp on their rolls! You definitely get a lot for what you pay for!  I ordered the kitchen sink with no rice and wow! IT WAS DELICOUS!!! I loved the topping of salmon, tuna and hamachi! I had never tried a roll with soy paper before and it was a pleasant surprise! The soy paper brought brought a slightly sweet flavor which paired great with the fish. It is a pretty filling roll!   I can't wait to go back and try more! Til next time I love sushi!",

Service was attentive, food was tasty, and there's something for everyone.   It's a good size restaurant with a slightly upscale atmosphere, and servers are dressed in traditional Japanese attire- cute touch! The main menu is pretty big and they have a wide selection of specialty rolls. We tried the Johnny's Special, Sean's Special, Ryan's Special, and Flower Rolls. The special rolls were HUGE! They were all good, some may have been a bit over sauced, but the standout for me was the Flower. Wrapped in soy paper (not what I would usually pick myself), it was fresh with a little spice, and I felt it showcased the fish the most. Another unexpected stand out was their steamed edamame- so flavorful and perfectly cooked.",

A name like that usually means terrible food, but man I was pleasantly surprised. When I walked in, the environment felt like a small street in Japan. The waiters and waitresses were dressed in Japanese attire. So at least the vibe was top notch. And plus based on how busy they were, you do have to make a reservation.  Now on to the food, we had the Sushi Boat for 3, the yellowtail sashimi was better than most. Although the tuna and salmon sashimi was on par with its competitors. As for the Philadelphia roll, that was actually good, I'm not a fan of it usually because the cream cheese can kill the whole sushi, but this one had the right ratio of cream cheese. The Alaska and Spicy tuna roll wasn't heavy you can taste the fresh seafood, it was like it was ready to go with the wasabi and soy sauce. The others I cannot comment because there was just too much food despite it saying it's for 3...otherwise this should be your first Sushi Boat experience!",

The employees recognize my voice & order when I call-in. I have a couple of favorites that I always order. One of which is their Lisa Hand Roll; which is made of spicy tuna, crab, avocado and shrimp tempura. I ordered (6) today along with a couple of other rolls.  Full disclosure. several years back, I had an issue twice with the Lisa Hand Rolls not being very full, they were half the size with very little tuna or crab in them. So they have been showing the rolls to me when I pick-up. I can only tell if they look to be normal size, I can't see what is in them. I haven't had an issue for the past few years until yesterday, they looked great, nice size, however...I called to let them know the Lisa hand rolls needed to be re-made, they were all filler, hardly any tuna and the tuna that was in them was stringy brown (disgusting) not pink. They told me that I had to return them first before they would remake them. I took them back and was interrogated by (3) different people, treated like a criminal. After the (3) of them conversed for a few minutes, they said they would remake them. When they brought them out to me, I was given a message from the chef, that he will never remake anything for me again, I was stunned.  Well when they showed me the remakes, they looked like something I've never seen before. They were very small with the reddest tuna I've ever seen, no crab, no filler, no avocado, no shrimp tempura, they were actually awful looking. Then what appeared to be a manager told me not to come back, they will NOT serve me ever again. To say the least, I was stunned by the treatment I received.",

The quality of the sushi was unbelievable.  Our server let us know ahead of time that we can ask for any roll wrapped in cucumber which I thought was pretty great considering I'm avoiding rice at the moment. Everything tasted fresh right out of the water and we were happily full but not overstuffed. We cannot wait to come back. From the service to the ambience this truly was a 5 star experience.",

    "text": "Not Impressed. We came here, first time due to good yelp reviews and I, personally was disappointed.  We were seated right away but the reception of the hostesses borderlined irritation.  We were waiting for two more people in our party so we sat at our table and delayed ordering until they've arrived.  We were asked multiple times if we were ready to order despite us repeatedly informing them that our party is on route.  We ordered the bento for lunch. It was good but by this time, I was already peed-off because of what we've experienced thus far.  I am not saying that I will not return to this place but it is definitely not on my top pick of Sushi places to take guests from out of state and out of the country when they visit.",

Though everything is ala carte, they have a huge variety of rolls to choose from. It was almost overwhelming to choose a couple because everything looked so good. Their dinner specials they have on their menu is bang for your buck because you get to choose two or three items and it comes with gyoza, salad, etc. I also like that at the beginning of every meal they give every person a little plate of pickled cucumbers. Good service for a large party. This place is kind of far from me but if I am ever in the area I would come back.",

I like how they bring out edamame and cucumbers for you while you wait which were good as well. Staff were attentive with filling my drink on a regular basis. I really enjoyed this place.

Mind you I don't want it boiling but is it too much to ask to have some steam rising from the bowl?  Service:  It's busy, I get it. Some mistakes disrupt a good time. Out of order delivery of food, asking for a fork multiple times--more than twice, and cold non-sushi food.  Cleanliness:  I felt like I walked into a gas station, the bathrooms wreaked of shit and urine. Clean that up please. Remember most of us are either getting ready to eat, eating, or just finished eating. Vomiting is not my favorite after dinner activity.  Will not return.",

Definitely convenient if you're staying at South Point and don't feel like going on the strip or downtown.  I Love Sushi has a very Japanese-style interior which I liked since it makes it more authentic. They have literally HUNDREDS of different types of specialty rolls..not to mention unique (and sometimes embarrassing) names for them! No kidding, it was a little overwhelming to be quite honest, haha. We ended up ordering the Screaming Orgasm, I Love My Ass roll, and the Spider roll. I enjoyed all of them, but I think my favorite would have to be the I Love My Ass roll. Super savory and delicious! The Screaming Orgasm was definitely good, too - it's more like a salad though, just FYI. The rolls are a little pricey, but their portions are pretty generous IMO, so no complaints here! I left with a VERY happy belly :)  So yes, recommended and I would definitely not mind eating here again if I'm ever staying at South Point again.",

People travel from all over town to eat here! They have very sexy & fun names for their sushi rolls! Coldest beers in town - large sapporro - fav!! My favorite rolls you have to order:  #1 Screaming Orgasm - Tuna with radishes that are cut like angel hair - good for low carb orders! #2 Kiss of Fire ( It's a little Spicy- if you prefer not spicy - just say no sauce- the little sliver of jalapeno on top is fresh so not very spicy) #3 Johnny Roll No Rice - Refreshing! #4 Sushi Nachos - Unlike anything you have ever had! Pure deliciousness! #5 Anthem roll - traditional Calif roll with spicy tuna on top. #6 Ryan's Special or Double D #7 Caterpillar Roll  This place is busy from open to close! Call ahead to get a reservation!",

Their American style sushi is prepared in front of you if you are sitting at the bar, which I recommend for a fun social experience. The staff is highly entertaining, serving double-duty as chef and social ring-leader they are somehow always successful at getting my group to participate in a round of saki bombs.   The chefs recommendations are always a good direction to go. Their service is fast but they don't rush you, allowing for a fun dinner experience whether you're out with a group or on a date.   The decor is cheesy and perfect. It can use an update, but if they do I fear the environment would change, so I do not recommend that they change a single thing.  If you are a sushi snob, this might not be the place for you, and we probably wouldn't want you hanging around us anyway. But if you are looking for yummy food and a consistently great time, I Love Sushi is your place.",

Next was the Tuna Tartar with Salmon (!) and avocado, which was easily the highlight of the event. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. The tempura shrimp in our first two rolls was tough and chewy, as if it had been fried a while ago. The other rolls were rather bland and forgettable. Would have been 3 stars with a clean napkin.",

Although it is not AYCE, I think for the quality of fish, it is perfectly priced.  I never leave here feeling like I overpaid.   Every roll is cut into huge pieces.  If you have a small mouth (like myself), it makes for some interesting eating trying to cram a whole piece into your mouth.  But it's also very filling!  I'ved tried the majority of the rolls at this place.  Here are a list of my favorites:  Kiss of Fire - Very spicy.  This is one of my favorite rolls I've had anywhere Franky Special - Just the right amount of spicy and sweet Burning my stomach - This thing is hot!! love it! Tastes Like My X-Girlfriend - Got to love the names of some of these rolls, but this is very good.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I've been here on a Tuesday, Friday, Saturday and I've never had a problem getting a table, but it is always crowded.  The service, this means everyone from the door person to the chefs, is excellent!  I love the atmosphere here, too.  It's very lively and has kind of a bar feel which really adds to the experience.    I don't care if my Japanese food is prepared and served by Koreans.  Good food is good food!  One word of caution:  this place does go kind of heavy on the sauce, so if that is not your thing, you may not love this place as much as I do.",

    "text": "Finally.  After trying about half a dozen sushi joints in town, I think my wife and I found one we will go back to regularly.  I Love Sushi gained instant credibility because a.) it was actually crowded when we went there (on a Monday no less) and b.) they didn't have some incredibly priced ala carte menu to entice you into their \"all you can eat\" offering.  I think my wife and I would each get our rolls again (I Love Sushi roll, The Mistake roll, some roll that had the word \"nipple\" in it, and another one I forget the name of).  The highlight for me was the sashimi.  For $5 the portion was great.  Three very thick pieces of salmon and incredibly dark/fresh tuna.  The salmon was delicious and maybe the best salmon sashimi I've had, same for the tuna.  In the words Ahhhnold, \"I'll be back.\"",

The freshest and most original menu I've ever had.  I've been to Tokyo twice, and I have to say this is as good if not better.   I've just become a regular. Staff excellent.   Don't miss great sushi in the desert. Whoooooooo Aaahhhhhhh!",

It gets busy around the dinner rush but they move tables really quickly. The sushi is always fresh and comes out really fast. Here are some suggestions: screaming orgasm, kiss of fire, mountain roll, Ryan's special, double d roll, threesome special... Everything is good. I've honestly never had a roll here that I don't like. The rolls are big so don't over order!   A definite must if you're in the Vegas/Henderson area!",

    "text": "I want to say I've been here three times between the end of last year up to this past May. The good part is that every trip was great! I was really, really skeptical when my co-workers informed me of a \"good\" sushi joint in Anthem, so it took them a while to convince me to take a trip here. I'm definitely glad they did.   What's different from other sushi restaurants is probably the most important. I like that they have several, really delicious, no-rice sushi options. Very cool for those that want to watch their carb intake (diabetics!). Also, this is a non-AYCE sushi joint. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I think that attributes to the freshness and quality of fish.  My favorite no-rice dishes are the Spring Mountain Roll (spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, radish sprout, eel, wrapped in rice paper, topped with spicy mayo and sriracha) and the Screaming Orgasm (tuna sashimi or seared, lots of julienned daikon, sauces galore, tobbiko, green onions). The Spring Mountain Roll is probably my overall favorite sushi roll. The last time I was there, the chefs gave us a bowl of tempura jalapeno. Not something I would ever order, but they were so good! And not terribly spicy either.   My only gripe was the terrible quality of the Ikura on my last visit. It was not good. But, to their defense, I hardly find really delicious Ikura or Uni in the valley. Other than that, it's just really busy during dinner. Service is usually pretty good, no complaints, but nothing amazing.  Overall, great place for a sushi fix!",

    "text": "It's Friday and my son was craving sushi, so I ordered ahead and picked up a Dragon Roll and Gary's Special.  The Dragon Roll is a California roll with eel and eel sauce on top.  I was cracking up because my son was eating the eel first, and then popping the rest in his mouth.  He loved it!  Gary's Special is a plethora of goodness, starting with spicy soft shell crab, spice tuna,  spicy crab, spicy scallop, and if that's not enough it's topped with yellowtail and salmon.  OMG.  My poor son, we were all digging in and trying this one.  Quick tip:  when you get it to-go, the sauce is served separately in a little plastic container (I love that!  Keeps thing from getting soggy).  Be sure to mix it up good, because I didn't and had too much oil, while my husband had the foresight to mix it up better and enjoyed a citrus note.  Although I Love Sushi is not an AYCE joint, it has some mighty fine sushi and a really nice variety of specialty rolls.  And, since it's right around the corner it's a favorite neighborhood place.  Enjoy!",

They offer a variety of special roll's. However, I ordered screaming orgasm and wooow... the seared tuna was fresh with there tasty sauce, and not chewy.    To top it off, an order of Nigori sake makes it all worth while. It compliments the sushi and seared tuna all together.",

The sushi was fresh, so i had no concerns of internal battles with fish and seaweed.   I am definitely not a sushi person but i have to admit that being drug out to I Love Sushi and being forced to have a good time was by far one of the best decisions ever made for me.

    "text": "For sushi in Las Vegas and Henderson... this is the ONLY place.  Quail Egg shooters, Uni shooters, unlimited choice of cleverly designed and monikered sushi rolls to satisfy any palette, beautifully prepared, fresh sashimi selections... I could go on but that would waste your time.  You should just start driving and get there.  For those needing a more thorough review - here it is.  James (the owner) and his wonderful band of creative chefs and service staff are a one-in-a-million find.  In 9 years of going to this place 4 times a month, I have never had a less than welcoming and wonderful dining experience.  Lunch or dinner - it makes no difference - you are warmly received, served the best fish in town, and you are quickly absorbed into the electric atmosphere.  The chefs are top notch and have a lot of leeway in terms of creating your perfect dish, even if it's not on the menu.  And that is saying something since their printed menu and roll & specialty menu exceeds 150 items.  Amazing:-)    Their food quality is 5-star.  But what makes it fun is how cleverly written the sushi roll selection menu is - sometimes inappropriate, yes, but always hysterical.  Selections include - Screaming Orgasm (large or small),  Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend, I Love My Ass and, of course, the well received I Love My Fat Ass.  The hilarity and creativity of the menu is only exceeded by the fact that all are beautifully prepared and DELICIOUS!   The biggest rave for I Love Sushi is the SERVICE!  Without fail this is the best trained, best managed and smartest group of servers and support staff in town.  One visit, they remember you.  Second visit they remember your name.  Third visit, you are part of the family.  Think Cheers meets the sushi industry - it's a winner.  If you are hankering for a sushi fix, please do not hesitate to join the party at I Love Sushi.  You will not be disappointed!  Tell them Shannon and Lisa sent you!",

I liked a lot of things about this place: The service was good, I was seated right away, and there was a large selection of sushi rolls. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about, was that there was no all-you-can-eat deals. If I wanted to fill my belly at this place, it probably would have cost me in excess of $100. Now, this is partly my fault, because I eat every meal as if I'm going to the chair, but there are lots of other sushi places which offer AYCE, and the quality is on par with this place. If this place offered AYCE, it would get 5 stars, hands down.",

The rolls were so flavorful, there wasn't a lot of rice packed in them and there of plenty of fish. The poki salad was great! Our waitress was nice and friendly, I think her same was Lisa :-) I wish I could have tried other stuff on the menu but I was stuffed. Oh yesss for dessert get the mochi combo :-) anyway I will be back soon! LOVED IT!",

    "text": "I love sushi, and this aptly named establishment delivers very good sushi. Armed with a varied menu of sexual innuendo sushi rolls, there is something for everyone.  I love sushi does not do all you can eat which makes it difficult to try different things on a budget but usually means better quality and attention.  Note - 3 stars means A-ok in my book.  To score higher, a restaurant needs to add the other things in that make restaurants appealing.  This is where this experience fell short but I enjoyed the food enough that I will return and hopefully update the review with additional accolades.  What fell short? 1) From the initial seating, we felt rushed. At least 3 times in the first 5 minutes, the sushi chef assigned to us (there must have been about 6 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar) asked us if we wanted to order. It was our first time in this restaurant and we were obviously going over the menu and I thought it less than friendly.  The bar was not overcrowded and there was no danger that other customers would be waiting without a seat.  Once we ordered the food came very quickly.however, when we wanted to make an additional order, we found all 6 chefs staring at a Nets game and not paying attention to the customers.  It literally took 5 minutes to get the chef's attention.  We ordered the sushi dynamite which tasted good however it said it came in a shell but it really comes in aluminum foil which gives it a very tinny taste and really lacks in presentation.  Finally, this is the most overpriced sushi restaurant not located on the strip.  if you order one of the special rolls, it costs nearly as much as an AYCE lunch.  The rolls we tried were good but there was nothing distinctive such as larger portions, better presentation, or fresher fish than a similar AYCE roll.  I do think this place has potential and on a busy night might actually be a fun place for the crowd and chefs.",

It comes with a really great sauce that you just want to drink. LOL  2. Salmon wrapped around avocado - No rice. -- I'm not usually a salmon fan, but this dish was really good. The salmon was fresh and melted in your mouth.   3. Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice - I've had this before at several other places... you cant really mess it up. The rice cake was nice and crispy and they top it with sriracha and a sliced jalapeno.   YUM.  I really enjoyed this place and would totally go back. We are out that way for our soccer tournament every April... so we will definitely be back.   GO HERE!",

It's about a 10 minute drive from the strip, where the plazas are all similar and filled with fast food and restaurants of all sorts. But I plead that you go down the road just a bit further to find this gem tucked away inside one of the plazas.  Upon entering the restaurant I couldn't help but notice the decor and the great atmosphere it had. It wasn't that the waitresses wore kimonos, nor was it the fact that the sushi chef all wore read outfits with a hat. The place itself it dimly lit, but gives off a warm feeling. There are both booth seats in front of the sushi chefs, as well as tables and booths. The booths are comfy, intimate and private. Though it didn't feel \"Japanese\" the atmosphere made it feel like it was full of Japanese mannerisms. It's hard to describe, but a welcoming and friendly place to be. You almost forget how bright and hot it is outside.  The service was also great. The waitresses constantly came to our table to make sure everything was okay. It was fabulous. They were not intrusive, and not too passive. It was just the right amount of pleasantry that anyone would desire to have at a restaurant.  The food was also good for the price you pay. Note that Henderson (Las Vegas) is no where near a beach, so don't go expecting freshly flown in tuna from Japan. That being said, the lunch special is a great deal. You get to pick two main entrees (including tonkatsu, soba, vegetable tempura, etc.) which also comes with soup, salad, rice, gyoza, and sometimes inari and tomago, all for just $8 (unless you get beef tonkatsu or a fish entree, not including saba). The sushi rolls themselves are good and made on par with any other Japanese restaurant, but not many I see have the Double D roll! It's quite good I recommend it, no pun intended.  Prices for the sushi is average ($12-14 for a specialty roll), but the lunch special steals the deal! Be sure to go here, I don't think you will be disappointed!",

    "text": "Meh. That sums up this place. Came here because I was in the area and I didn't have time to sift through reviews, so went with the 4.5 stars.   Presented with the extensive roll menu, then got a food menu. Had to then ask for a sushi menu. Tells you something about the clientele around here. Can't fault a restaurant for giving the customer what it wants.   I just had an assortment of sushi, was decent. Maybe a slight cut above what you could get at an AYCE place, but not great for the price. The salmon had a slight chemical aftertaste, not sure where it comes from. Sometimes get it at AYCE places too.  Decor is kinda tacky, feels pretty worn. They should definitely look to renovate within the next few years while they are still popular.",

    "text": "Food, service, atmosphere: all fantastic!!   This gem of a sushi restaurant is in a small strip center. It's worth it tho, because once you step in, you're transported to what you would think would have to be an expensive restaurant. However, it's not.   The geisha-inspired waitress brings you hot towels and a palate-cleansing cucumber salad while you peruse the menu.  The sushi is plentiful and has ingenious names like 'Bam Bam' and ' Screaming Orgasm'. We had the Monkey Roll, the crunch roll, the Bam Bam, and some baked mussels. The hot tea is HOT, so be careful! The staff is attentive, the food comes out quickly, and the sushi is fresh off the boat!!   My kids are sushi sharks, and my 9 year old son doubles down on his spice, so this was definitely a place for us. Good stuff, and we will be back!",

I would definitely hire their interior designer if I ever opened a sushi joint. Furthermore, I like how everyone is in costume from the sushi chefs to the kimonos on the waitresses.   3 stars for Nigiri: Ordered yellowtail, salmon, and uni. It wasn't fresh as I expected. Is it because it was a Monday night?  2 stars for Dinner Bento box: It came with tofu steak, katsu, and other bento items. Weak dish, pobably not a good idea to order it again.  3 stars for Kake Udon: Noodles were perfectly cooked, broth had a nice mushroom/earthy undertone.  3.5 stars for agedashi tofu: Decent flavors and decent serving (enough for 3-4 people to share).   Conclusion: It seems that I should try famous rolls next time I return. I really like the interior design so much that I'd come here with my friends to grab a few drinks and appetizers in the near future.",

We noticed the last time it was slower than normal, but we got our food. Today, we went with our 16 month as usual, and an hour later still no food. The place wasn't even busy! When we kept asking all they said was I'm sort it's coming. People who got there after us were either eating or already done. Then when I said we were leaving because my daughter needed to eat, they just started bring rolls out....not even her chicken teriyaki. Nothing was done or offered, aside an apology, so we said we were leaving. They didn't even try to stop us and make us pay. I'm in shock by this whole thing! I am so sad that the new owners are failing with what used to be one of, if not the best sushi places in town.",

    "text": "Initially we had chosen to eat at this place solely based on Yelp reviews. I mean a place must be REALLY good if it rates 4.5 stars out of 5 correct?! Boy was I wrong.   When we first entered this place, I thought it was a pretty cool ambience. We entered on a Saturday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Waitresses greeted you with cute kumonos (sp?) on and cool Japanese music was playing in the background.  The first thing I noticed is that there is no AYCE here?! What the heck is up with that? And to top it off, one specialty sushi roll is average about $16.00 PER ROLL! A spicy ahi Hand roll was $6.25 per roll? You have got to be kidding me. Better be sprinkled with gold or something!  So quickly, my boyfriend and I decide on a lunch entree instead. Mind you, my boyfriend and Just came from the gym and expo so we are starving! We order 3 entrees for 2 of us and while we are ordering the third entree the waitress says something along the lines of \"oi! More food?\" I thought it was rude and then hilarious!  I did not get the waitresses name but she was probably the heaviest one there (just so that you can spot her, and not experience her rudeness.) Anyway, she delivers our 2 entrees and once she places my plate down she says \"no more entree for you okay?\" I had to kind of piece it together that she meant it was after 3 so no lunch special. She does not say anything about our third entree after like 10 minutes of not delivering it. So I proceed on asking her where it could possibly be and she rudely cuts me off and says \"it's on the way!!\"  After we are finished eating and she is cleaning our table she sees that I could not finish the tempura (2 onion tempura) and proceeds to tell me that I can request no onion next time! I cut her off and explain that I was full!   Horrible experience and to top it off, I got diarrhea after eating there! I'd rather eat at Sushi mon! They have all you can eat and not rude whatsoever.",

There is an older man who is so cute he owns the place and he is there everyday. He seats you and checks on your through your meal. The staff wears kimonos and look very traditional, the place looks \"crowded\" at first but you warm up to its cozy vibe. I ordered albacore sushi and a baked lobster roll, so good. They are really good with food preferences and allergies too, I'm allergic to mushrooms and my roll had it in it so they made it without them. My sister had the mountain roll and it comes in a little pyramid and it has salmon and crab! This place is now my go to for sushi!",

The specialty rolls were ok but I am partial to regular sushi.  I came here last week for my first time and I have been back already.  The beer is 6 bucks for a large Kirin or Sapporo. This place was recommended to me by a local and now I recommend it to you.",

She actually noticed that one roll was left pretty much untouched and asked how it was. The shrimp tempura was cold and extremely dry. She didn't take it off our bill, but at least she apologized. Agedashi tofu was good, but none of the rolls we tried was impressive. If anything, they sucked.  Not a good experience.",

They are prompt in making the sushi and the wait staff immediately clears the plate once you've finished. There is almost a factory like quality to the service in terms of efficiency. Although I haven't personally experienced, but my friend tells me that this \"efficiency\" also makes this place a bit undesireable if you just want to sit at a table and have a leisurely dinner. If your table finishes their plates and are just hanging out, it's almost guranteed that they will be politely asked to allow the wait staff to clear the table for a following reservation.",

As soon as we were seated we were given warm towels to clean our hands with, which is a nice bonus you don't get at many sushi restaurants. Even though there were many customers at the restaurant and more kept coming in, I was surprised at how fast our food came out after we ordered. Hubby and I ordered the chicken teriyaki entree, and 2 rolls (Happy Ending and Alligator). Everything tasted so fresh and just right; the rolls are also a good portion.  I was also surprised at how spacious this restaurant was; from the outside it doesn't look very big, but this place can definitely accommodate large groups! Will definitely be coming back here :)",

The prices here are higher than I normally pay for nigiri sushi, but the pieces of fish are possibly half again the size that you get at Sushi Mon or Yummy Grill Sushi, so you get more for the money.  The ikura is GREAT- fresh and huge!  I tried their inari and liked that as well- not overly sweet , overly wet or overly dry, and the soy \"pockets\" have a nice texture- I'm picky about my inari and theirs is my favorite so far.     I had lunch there on a weekday around noon and the place filled up pretty rapidly. But service was slow before it filled up- I think the waitress forgot we were there or assumed we'd need more time to decide.    The names of their sushi are ridiculous- one even has the word \"a$$\" in it!  The names don't seem to correspond to the food at all (what do you put in a sushi roll called \"Whose Your Pimp?\" anyway?), and the silly names don't jibe with the formal decor and politeness of the waiters either.  I would have been embarrassed to ask one of those nice ladies for that \"a$$\" roll!  :-D  Is this place good for kids?  Well, the food's great.  Just hide that menu from them!",

I had the Screaming Orgasm, Tastes like my ex-girlfriend, and several other rolls which weren't as memorable. The shishito peppers were a total ripoff, i've had way better and fresher ones made at other Japanese restaurants.   The service was terrible. Our sushi-chef Ray (i think that was his name), was very accommodating, but the servers were all very impolite and sometimes rude. It took my girlfriend three times to get an order of the shishito peppers and when the waitress forgot she gave us a disgusted look. The waitress also knocked over our chopsticks onto the sushi bar on multiple occasions and didn't even bother giving us a new set, she just put them back on our plates.  Pricewise the place is decent. For the three of us (two guys, one girl), the check was approximately $70 including tip and we left decently stuffed. Would I come back? Probably not unless a friend suggested it.",

They do a killing on the weekends, so call in to make a reservation! If you're staying in LV, it's worth the drive to Henderson. Trust me. There is no all-you-can eat here. It's not that kind of fresh dead fish place. You'll get plenty full off a couple of rolls a lil cucumber salad and complimentary edamame.

I was on a date and heard more of the conversations at other tables than my own.  After waiting half an hour to be seated, the waitress led us to a table and ran off. It took the waitress a while to bring just water and once she did she walked off. After we ordered and waited about 40 min, we asked three times about our food and they said it was coming but the food didn't come till about a full hour after we ordered. The food was messy and was not at a desirable temperature. It seemed like they had neglected our food.

They often have special items not on the menu, so ask your chef what they have. They also have fresh wasabi root that is grated if you ask for it. Everyone is friendly, from the chef, to the servers and the owner. We are always greeted when we walk in the door. We have friends and family that have eaten sushi across the US and they agree this is the best.",

Be sure to take care of your staff of chefs here (seriously, I think there were 8 of them) with beer and they'll reciprocate generously.  I really just come here to hang out and drink with a local LV friend of mine and not really to eat.  However, I've learned the sashimi is the better way to go here as they give you generous amounts of it and is pretty good.  I suggest the albacore tataki or the yellowtail.  Make friends and have a great time....but be sure to have a designated driver or take a taxi if you plan to drink heavy here as it's pretty far back to the strip.",

Their service was good and friendly, and I liked that my cup of tea never went empty. Prices were reasonable as well, especially given the quality. You can't beat the names of their rolls. The specialty rolls are HUGE. My friend and I were stuffed sharing two specialty rolls and a maki roll.  If you're in Las Vegas and in the mood for Japanese food, make your way to I Love Sushi if you can!",

It's been around for a while and it's definitely high up on the list of best sushi in Vegas. It's a pretty huge place with a large sushi bar, tables and private booths as well, not as cozy as I prefer, but it does have that rowdy vibe that some of my favourite California places have. The sushi chefs usually end up pretty smashed by the end of the night, which makes things fun.",

    "text": "This place is one of the best sushi places here in the Vegas area.  Each sushi roll and every bit of nigiri is prepared with care and made to look beautiful.  The prices are standard for sushi, and not too expensive, though of course not something you can get every day in good conscience.    The service is good.  I've eaten several times at different times in the day, and the waitresses are always polite and prompt.  They're a little subdued in early afternoon, but they're quite nice at dinner times.  The atmosphere varies, but not at all badly.  In the lunch times and early evenings, when there isn't as many people, they're a quiet, pretty restaurant that you'd take someone for a chat while you eat, whereas when you are at dinner, especially on a Friday or Saturday, they're full and very noisy.  Why noisy?  Because the sushi chefs are busy being fun and crazy and flirty (with women) and sometimes randomly offer free drinks and shots of things, and if not, then they're being bought drinks by the appreciative customers.  But the service is always good.  The quality of the fish has never let me down.  Even on Sunday nights, when most sushi places are at the other end of freshness, I Love Sushi seems to chug along as usual, and some of the dishes just can't be matched anywhere.    I always eat Dynamite at sushi places, and theirs was quite good, if not the best in the entire world.  I'd say it'd be great to order if you're there, but not worth a special trip.  Overall, I love coming here when I have extra cash on hand.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have an all-you-can-eat option, which I suppose would make the service level fall, the quality diminish, and the presentation falter.  But I eat a lot of sushi :/",

We don't get to indulge on sushi often, it's a treat when we're able to afford to go eat sushi. Today my husband and I were excited to go to our spot to get some sushi, sadly it was the worst I've had in a long while.. my salmon was SUPER fishy and even my california roll was fishy, how does that even happen? My husband wasn't as displeased with his roll or his yellowtail, but it definitely wasn't on par with our previous visits. I don't know if it was an off day or if this place is going down hill. To be completely honest, we probably won't be back. They don't offer AYCE so everything is a bit pricey, in my opinion if you're not going to offer AYCE you need to make sure your fish is fresh. Can I also mention it was a Saturday? Wouldn't you expect the weekend the fish would be the most fresh because of how much traffic they get on a weekend? I won't be recommending I Love Sushi anymore :(",

Everyone just seemed to be having a great time.  One of the really nice things is they have plenty of staff to get your food out to you quickly and in and out in a timely manner.  I tried the screaming organism because of the reviews, it was really good and I loved the sauce.  I also tried the kiss of fire, but on the not so spicy side.  It was good as well.  This place was a nice find for a fun, quick sushi stop.",

    "text": "This place is the bombbbbbb.   Two things struck me the most: The exceptional SERVICE! I loved how attentive my waiter was. Patient and not pushy. Nice and helpful, called attention to the chefs when he didn't know the answer to something (we were sitting at the bar) and overall fantastic. And of course the food was fab.   We ordered the Johnny's Roll ( see attached picture) which had soft shell crab and albacore. DELICIOUS. It was elegant and simple. Their selection of rolls is far and extensive and it's quite difficult to even pick but you really can't go wrong with anything that's in their $13 price point. Also, I feel like their deluxe rolls all have a variation of some soft shell crab in it ... Next time I would try Gary's Roll(soft shell crab with yellowtail and salmon!!) . But the albacore was incredibly good that night.   Hamachi collar and salmon collar (see attached picture). Delicious and big portions. Salmon collar seemed to have more food though but both were done well.   1 order each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail and albacore sashimi. (Attached picture) At $5 an order, I expected it to be a bigger cut. Sure it was good and fresh, but the pieces were puny and uneven.    Lastly we tried nabeyaki udon (not pictured :( ), a mix of tempura shrimp and veggies. I only had some broth and hands down, it was done very well. For the price however $11.95, I thought the portions were small.   Overall, very pleased with my servers at the bar, all male, who were all super attentive!! (I asked for one plate and he brought out a bunch for my entire family without asking) and continually checked up on us in a non pushy way.   Come here early though, this place gets crowded!!",

They have a large selection of rolls also if that's what you're looking for, but def come for the sushi and staff.

This place is not all you can eat for a reason. Their sushi quality is always top notch and their rolls are what they are known for here. Some sushi roll recommendations of mine are the kitchen sink, screaming orgasm with salmon, one night stand, Sean special, Frankie's special, and jackpot. The hamachi Kama here is also amazing. This is not a place you go to for \"quantity\" if you're a huge AYCE fan and simply want nigiri then this isn't for you. If you want bomb ass sushi rolls and the best screaming o in town then come here.",

Other than that, everything else here was standard. The fish is fresh here because they stay busy. We also tried the oyster shooter and the uni shooter. I really didn't like it because it was salty, maybe it was the ponzu sauce? We had one roll, I think it was the Joe's roll? It was good.

Also, and maybe it's just me, but I'm so sick of all the dumb roll names. Really? Does every sushi joint need to serve \"orgasm sauce?\" One Yelper described this as \"ingenious.\" Wrong \"I\" word--more like \"idiotic.\" And there's like a million selections with just one ingredient varying in each. It took me a solid 15 minutes to order two rolls to go. Too much work.   I'd rather go somewhere else without the insane lists and just get a good freaking roll not drowning in a mayo-based bodily-fluid referenced sauce.",

Right away I was very impressed with the atmosphere and the decor.  It is very fun and modern with Japanese paper lanterns hung about and nice artwork and booths.  I was immediately seated at the sushi bar.  The sushi chef recommended the Washington Roll for me and it was exactly what I was wanting with salmon on the outside of the roll and salmon on the inside of the roll.  The salmon is so incredibly fresh and tastes like butter.  A little splash of soy and wasabi...ahhhh.  I followed that with two pieces of Maguro Tuna.  It was a very nice meal.  It's a fun atmosphere and there was a lot of interesting people there.  If I am on that side of town again I will definitely drop in.  It was a lovely experience.",

My friend and I came here for dinner with Hunnie Bunnie. She ordered the Udon noodles like usual and some edamame. No complaints from her.  We had the garlic edamame: pretty damn good! It could have used more sauce but the flavor was good and the edamame was cooked well.  We had nigiri sweet shrimp: this was SO good. The shrimp was VERY sweet and BIG and the shrimp heads were HUGE. Good stuff!  The only one I didn't care for (I even spit it out in my napkin) was the Garlic Tuna Nigiri. I'm not sure if it was the flavor or just the fish itself - it was kind of rubbery, hard to chew. YUCK.  The rest of it was QUITE good though, salmon, tuna, white fish, albacore, scallop, unagi nigiri.  It definitely wasn't as amazing as it was the first time I had it but nonetheless it was still GOOD.  Oh yeah and we tried one roll: Tiger Roll. It was aiight. There are SO many rolls listed on the sheet of paper you check off and I didn't see any explanations of what was inside of them. I've had a Tiger Roll before so I wanted to try it here, however this one definitely had different ingredients then ones I've had before.",

Some of my favorite special rolls:  -Spring Mountain (my all-time favorite so far): spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, tempura shrimp, avocado, radish sprout wrapped in rice paper, special sauce (spicy mayo & eel). -Something Wrong #7: spicy soft shell crab in and out, cucumber & 5 different fish on top & chef's special sauce. -Monkey Roll: salmon, cream cheese, avocado, mango, tempura crumbs outside and mango sauce. -Jackpot Special -I Love Sushi Special  Each of their special rolls typically runs between $10 - $13 for 1 whole roll (8 pieces).  I find that getting 3 full rolls will typically fill me and one other person up.",

We try different things off their large sushi menu (it's almost overwhelming!) and always end up with a new favorite - I usually also order either a rainbow roll or spider roll because they are my favorites. They have something for everyone - basic sushi, spicy, mozzarella filled, baked, deep fried - so. much.sushi!!  The decor and costumes are cute, and sometimes the service is slow cause they are usually very busy - but we always have a great meal here and I think it's the best priced sushi in Vegas! The sushi is the only thing I've ordered here, I don't think I've ever been in a group where something has been ordered off the menu...",

First of all if you go to I love sushi and don't order the Lisa handroll you're crazy because it is cone shaped heaven, like I could probably just eat those for the rest of my life!! Anywhooo I also enjoy their Double D roll and screaming orgasm appetizer,  not to mention they have ridiculously fresh sashimi.  They do not have AYCE which is kind of a bummer but everythings very high quality so I get it (Sushi Mon had delicious AYCE)  It get super busy though so I would suggest making a reservation.  Also their waitresses have always been very sweet and attentive I don't think I've ever had a bad experience there.. happy eating!",

Like almost all great Vegas restaurants, the place is in a strip mall, tucked in a corner spot. Although unassuming, the restaurant itself is actually kinda big.  I didn't look too closely but I believe they have the sushi boats in the center bar.   The service was excellent. The food came out quick and when we ordered some lasagna roll, the waitress advised that it would take 10-15 minutes to bake and come out.     There is an extensive menu of sushi to choose from -- we had several rolls, including the Screaming Orgasm, XXX, Monkey Roll, and something with mango and creme cheese (two things I love).  All the rolls were delicious and the fish was very fresh.  Once again, I'm amazed about the quality of sushi in Vegas -- you know, being land locked and all. I was very satisfied with I Love Sushi, and will go again.",

Like, this place is about a mile from my house, and a block from where I went to high school and we'd walk here after school and get takeout (we were spoiled ok?!). We knew the sushi chefs by name, and when we got a little older (not old enough), we'd sneak sake bombs before going out to the coolest party ever. The inappropriate names for the rolls were the funniest thing we'd ever seen- it was the bees knees and the best sushi I'd ever had.   Fast forward 10 years, and sadly times have changed. The quality of the fish seems to have gone downhill and the cold fresh rolls just don't taste as fresh and the hot crunchy rolls are drenched in indistinguishable sauces. I really hate to say this, but last time I was here a few weeks ago, two of us got sick from eating the same roll. It's still a fun place to meet friends and get some so-so food, but now when we want a quality sushi dinner (it's all relative), we'll head down to Spicy Tuna.",

    "text": "So I have had a back and forth journey with this restaurant, and this has what has kept me from reviewing it.  I finally feel ready.  The first thing to know about this place is that there is no all you can eat and the rolls often are averaging around 13 dollars each (the ones I ordered normally around 14).  This automatically puts an expectation that they should be higher quality than an average sushi joint.  When you come inside the waitresses are dressed in traditional Japanese clothing and the restaurant is very sizeable, with lots of tables and booths, and a huge sushi bar.  Often there are many sushi chefs working behind it.  Despite its massive size, even on a busy night the service was relatively quick, and they work like a well oiled machine.  Now to the food, the first time I ever came here was about 4 years ago after being told I had to by multiple people.  I ordered a roll that involved mango and some other fun flavors, yet it was so bland and flavorless.  I refused to go back after that, and believed this place was over hyped.  I had a go to spot kaizen down the road so I had no need for them, however kaizen began to go down hill to the point that I gave up in them and jumped ship as a loyal customer.    I was desperate and in need of sushi that was close by so I thought ok I will give I love sushi one more shot.  I ended up really enjoying my rolls! Totally different experience, I thought maybe I had just ordered wrong last time. I had got the 90 percent roll, bam bam roll and spring mountain roll I believe.  These were packed with flavor, and I continued to have a similar experience the times I would drive up to get my sushi fix, until about 6 months ago.  I went alone just wanting grab one roll, and it was one I had enjoyed in the past.  It had ponzu sauce on it and shrimp tempura and many other yummy things.  However they weren't yummy, it tasted so much saltier than normal and the tempura was not crispy, it tasted liken it had been sitting out and the pack on the roll was sloppy. I was sad, and my craving not fullfilled with goodness.    I hoped it was a fluke so I went this past Saturday since monta was closed for renovations, and I was starving for something Japanese. I was greeted by insanity! It was a football night, and I guess this place becomes a sports bar when that happens, it was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend talk.  Whatever just give me good food that is all I want, we ordered the niku udon for the first time.  They have the medium thickness udon, not as thin as I prefer, but not thick like slugs.  It was some of the better niku in the valley,with a really full bodied broth, and the reason this review is not two stars.  I also ordered the 90 percent roll, a roll I thought I could trust, and another roll that had various forms of yellow tail and a \"orange sauce\".  The yellow tail roll was fine, not amazing though for its price tag.  The bam bam roll was aweful. The dip was saltier than it used to be, and the soft shell crab had become oddly tough.   So sadly unless I really want some niku, I am over this place.  Good sushi in a desert is so elusive, I will continue my search.",

The James Bond is basically the same but with rice. If you are kinda into sushi or on the fence you have to try I love sushi!

Rainbow roll is very fresh very good all of their sushi rolls are incredibly fresh and really tasty. The only downside to this place is that it's a way off the beaten path so you Gotta really want to go to it!",

The grand canyon roll is california rolls topped with cooked shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, green onion and an amazing sauce.

Although the prices are on the higher side it is worth it. The restaurant is spacious and I enjoy being able to see the cooks making the sushi. I do recommend this restaurant for anyone who is in search of a good time and good food! This place is very cute for a first date or just out for a group hangout with friends. The costumer service was dive and everyone was very welcoming. The place looked very clean which is always a plus. I love the fact that the menu has many funny names for the plates such as \"I love my ass\" and so on. Which I enjoyed when I was ordering it infront of my family. All around I had a great time being in this restaurant and trying many plates at once was pretty amazing .I am a pretty heavy eater and this sushi definitely filled me up. Coming back to this restaurant would probably be very hard for me to achieve since it's so far but I would definitely head over if an around Las Vegas once more. The cool part of this place is that the is that when I went the place wasn't very packed and we were able to get our food pretty quickly. This place created a new memory for me, my cousin, and my sister where we all took the time to hangout at Vegas and come here and eat some sushi. I enjoyed being able to sit down and have a meal with my family. This restaurant felt very calming and relaxing and was a perfect environment to just relax with family. I loved that the restaurant's color was a dark wood color. While sitting in the far left side of the restaurant I was able to see the kitchen where the sushi chefs made sushi and also the restaurants restroom. We were there for along of 2 hours just chatting about life and my comfort zone protect. Which we all made a joke about it. We were all recording each other making \"yummy\" sounds just for the video and laughed for hours. I would love to come back to relive those moments I had my family in Las Vegas.",

I ordered some lobster rolls (i think it was little \" heavy \") and the Monkey roll (salmon, avocado, cream cheese, sesame seeds) it was very good forgot to mention the special sauce they put on the side so my sushi is not soggy.

Since i was waiting for 20mns, I was looking at the staff running around, none of them had a smile on their face ...  The 2 girls at the entrance were a little \"rude\", when I came in I asked for the menu so i could order to go  and if they had any suggestion for some rolls with cream cheese and avocado. they looked at me and whispered something in front of my face, that was very rude...

It's hard to want to pay for nigiri (where quality fish really shines) it you're not at all you can eat, and quite frankly I've had just as good of quality sushi other places in town that do offer ayce. Furthermore, the price doesn't really compensate for the lack of ayce option like other non-ayce places do. And to top of off, our service was terrible. Save your money and go somewhere else.

This place is packed day in and day out - no matter the time or day. That speaks volumes of how much the locals love it.  The owner - James - is consistently in there every night making sure the place runs smooth and efficiently. Such a nice and friendly guy. He always takes care of my girlfriend and I whenever we eat here (we eat here a lot btw).   The Staff and Waitresses here are awesome and always on top of it with a smile on their face.  The sushi chefs are the best you can find!   Let's get down to why we come here - for the food!  The Sushi here is top of the line. The fish is of the highest quality and always fresh. Not to mention - the portions here are huge for a great price! The sashimi cuts are huge! The rolls are huge! They will even substitute for Brown Rice (which I always do)  The dinner menu items are really good if trying to do something other than sashimi or sushi rolls.   The rolls here are my favorite! The variety and selection of rolls is crazy - there are over 100 rolls! The rolls are huge! And not because they are full of rice like most sushi places - but because they are stacked with fish! These rolls will not disappoint.  A few of my favorites are: The James Special The Ryan's Special One Night Stand Kitchen Sink Something wrong 69 Spring Mountain Double D Screaming Orgasm Flower roll Stacy's Mom Las Vegas Roll I Love My Ass Lisa Hand Roll Bonzai Roll Monkey Roll  I have a lot of favorites - when I come here with my girlfriend, there is so much to choose from we usually end up ordering more than we can handle. Oh well :)",

It's a heaping pile of tuna on top of some sort of shaved radish with a secret sauce so good you'll want to drink it. You get a little house cucumber salad with some sort of fish and dressing, very good. They have a huge menu and that can be a little overwhelming, the waitress gave a few suggestions and she didn't let us down.",

I love the sashimi salads that are full of fresh fish & filling!    I am a regular at I Love Sushi & have ordered these rolls above numerous times.  The lady next to me ordered the MC Roll & it looked amazing so will definitely try that next time!  It had tempura halibut & she said it was her absolute fav!    Always friendly staff greets you, quickly to seats you & takes your drink order like clockwork.  I always sit at the sushi bar & order a sparkling water, which only comes in large, sake or wine. Whether you are on a time limit or not, they are always consistent, I have even been in & out of there in 20 minutes!    Lately, I've been to a couple sushi restaurants that never say 'arigato'.  I don't want that to go away ever that's part of the experience.  I love the whole wonderful sushi experience, even the small stuff.  Kanpai  8.10.16 Love these people that work here even more & tried the MC Roll as recommended earlier... AWESOME!  I wish I could give them more stars.   Thank you I Love Sushi!",

Funny thing is I heard of this place 10 yrs ago watching Poker on TV and the pro players were talking about it. So happy I love poker. But happier I love Sushi  They literally have ~100 different rolls. All I can say is read them all and focus on the type of fish you love and just try it.

It's amazing and great quality. Some must try items: Lisa Handroll (my all time favorite!!!), something wrong #15, and Tuna Karai. They are all amazing. So amazing that I just stuffed my face and forgot to take pictures until everything was gone except part of the something wrong haha.

That Deep Fried Cheesecake is everything! It tasted like a delicious funnel cake, lol.  And there's something to eat for everyone. Even if you are not a \"sushi\" person.   By the way, you can tell they get creative with naming their meals, lol. The names will make you laugh and think \"I can't believe they named it that!\"  Service is fantastic! The staff is so active, quick, and friendly. This is a great place for family and/or friends to have a great time.   Prices: I would say it's moderate ($$).  They make everything at time of order. Groups are always coming through here because they can easily share the food and share the bill. ;-)  If it was too expensive, I would think most locals wouldn't be coming  on a nightly busy.   Location: it's located in a shopping plaza near Sunridge Heights.  I love sushi! What move can I say, but just go and check them out!",

We tried two of their nigiri - halibut  and garlic tuna nigiri at around $4.25 each for two pieces. Fresh fish, but too much ponzu.  We ordered two cut rolls. The spicy tuna roll was quite spicy but delicious. So was the eel roll.   Tried the lunch special. You can choose two entrees and it comes with salad, miso soup, inari, tamago, chicken gyoza and steamed rice. We ordered the chicken katsu (cut into six pieces and breaded just right) and salmon teriyaki ($1 extra).  We also ordered three specialty rolls: screaming orgasm, something gone wrong #7, and taste like my x-girlfriend. The screaming orgasm had no sushi rice at all but was very good. Halfway through though, the sauce became too much, especially if you eat the shredded radish under the fish---it sucked up all the sauce. The taste like my x-girlfriend was delicious but also too much sauce. The best was something gone wrong #7. So so good. It also comes in a dipping sauce, but is perfectly yummy without it.  Add in two hot green teas and I was $81 lighter after our meal. I'd come back again, but request less sauce. Ample parking in the plaza lot.",

    "text": "Screw best sushi in Vegas. I'm calling it, right now..BEST sushi in the world. Sorry Jiro, you have your dreams AND three Michelin stars, I Love Sushi gets the \"best sushi in the world\" title. I've had sushi from the west coast to the east coast. I've had it in four different countries (Japan wasn't one of them) and I Love Sushi is the best.  I'm not even going to go into the simple stuff, like perfectly cooked edamame, or the gyoza that can be ordered steamed or fried, the cool ambiance or the super friendly staff. You can get all of that at any sushi/Japanese restaurant.  I'm going to talk about their raw fish. Clean, fresh, seasoned to perfection, beautifully sliced, raw fish. Each piece of fish sets on top of a well proportioned pillow of rice. One bite and your sushi world will be destroyed. Every other sushi joint will fail to live up to I Love Sushi. Sure, you'll try other joints, mix things up a bit, but the whole time you'll be thinking \"man I wish I was at I Love Sushi\".  Don't take it from me though. Go there and order a \"screaming orgasm\". It's tuna, ever-so-lightly seared, swimming in a pool of their in-house made ponzu sauce on a bed of shaved daikon. If that's not enough try the \"something wrong 69\" roll. I: shrimp tempura soft shell crab. O: more soft shell crab and five different types of raw fish. PLUS it's served with a side of their DELISH ponzu.  And to the people giving low stars based on chicken teriyaki, or that the screaming orgasm doesn't come with rice...animals don't deserve to die to be eaten by you. Just saying.",

I thought that I Love Sushi would be a sure bet because I have dined here and ordered take-out numerous times before and enjoyed it.   Tonight was different. The older woman was our server and she provided us with the worst customer service I've received in a long time. From the moment we sat down, she was very quick and cold with us. No smile, not welcoming in the least bit. She took my order with so much attitude and a sense of annoyance in her voice.  My friend and I ordered Tempura Yakisoba and Teriyaki Shrimp. The food itself was just okay. The Yakisoba was on the sweeter side and the Shrimp was very rubbery.   As I was clearly still working on my food, the woman decides to approach us and just give us the check. No \"Are you all set?\" \"Do you have room for dessert?\" NOTHING. She basically just sat the check on our table. Which also confused me because there was a couple right next to us who had been dining longer than us and she never once approached them with their check. It felt as if she was specifically trying to rush us out.   I have no idea what her issue is or why her customer service skills are so awful, but they have lost a loyal customer. I will no longer be returning or suggesting this place to friends and family.",

The chicken teriyaki, tempura, and dinner combinations are all excellent and well-worth the price (you get a LOT of food with your entrees). Recently, I started a personal challenge to try ALL 100+ chef specials on the sushi menu  (I'm in the mid-60s right now) and I haven't been disappointed yet.  Some must trys are: Sushi Nachos, the Grand Canyon roll, Something Wrong #69, and-of course-the Screaming Orgasm.  Be sure to ask for Lisa's section, too.  She'll make an already amazing experience perfect!",

They also have funny/ interesting names  I had the Crazy horse, and the monkey roll. So delicious. I love Philadelphia rolls so I picked these two because they had salmon and cream cheese. The monkey roll had so much flavor, beautifully presented. Basically a Philadelphia roll but with a twist as it has mango and \"red crunch\" on top with a sauce, I don't remember what it was though. The crazy horse was more simple but equally satisfying. It was tempura but it was a nice thin line not super thick like other places, and with that you get the full flavor of the inside (the salmon, cream cheese, ect)    My bf had the last call which had mozzarella and crab. It was surprisingly good considering cheese isn't traditional included in sushi, but it was different and delicious   The lobster roll was too plain for my taste but it was well made  Overall this place is awesome. The sushi is creative and of great quality, the sushi chefs are very friendly and are more than happy to recommend what sushi to get and are knowledgeable about what they're doing.  The decor is ok, nothing exceptional. The service is also whatevers, the waitress accidentally poked me in the face with my chopsticks while taking my plates away and only said a whispered sorry, but didn't really care.   Wish I had taken pics of the food but it was that good that I gobbled it up and forgot.",

Our server noticed some gifts on the table for a birthday we were celebrating and she brought out some ice cream for us all free of charge without us even asking which I was really impressed by. She really went above and beyond. We also stuck around for a couple of hours after we finished our meal because I hadn't seen my friends in a while and we were catching up. Granted it wasn't really a busy night, our server didn't try to shoo us away or make us feel bad for lingering. Overall, great food and great customer service!",

If you want to kick things up a notch, ask for the Spicy Ponzu instead of using regular soy sauce. The sushi always tastes fresh and their rolls are very creative. Service is always quick. One of my favorite go-to places.",

We were greeted by a kimono-clad hostess/server, which was a nice touch and sat in a wooden, semi-enclosed booth.  There is an extensive list of sushi rolls with extraordinary names!  Very non-traditional, but still yummy.  I ordered the bento box with teriyaki salmon and some kind of mackerel.  It came with a little bowl of rice and a tempura rice ball, which was unique and of course miso soup and salad.  Also ordered a pepper tuna plate, which I shared with my hubby.  It was slices of pepper tuna in a yummy ponzu-like sauce.  Delicious.  Fish was fresh and service was good.  This place is way on the other side of the world, but I would definitely go again if my sister was so inclined! :)",

You can miss it easily, as it's tucked into the back of a strip mall...with one tiny little sign to let you know where to turn.  But if you miss it, keep circling until you find it...it's worth it.  Consistently fresh sushi, and reasonable prices.  Great, dark wood decor, with serving staff in full traditional dress.  I always feel like I'm on a little fantastic voyage away from Vegas when I step in here.  Service isn't as great as some others in the valley, but the price is right, so I can cope with a little less butt-kissing.  One of my top sushi picks in the city.  Enjoy!",

Screaming Orgasm, The Threesome, etc.), to the timely and polite service from both the waitresses and sushi chef's, this place is great.

You can sit at the sushi bar, there are numerous tables throughout the restaurant, and there are booths that offer a more private experience.  Service was decent, but we had to wait a long time for our check.  This was annoying as it was lunch time on a weekday, we clearly weren't looking for a 2 hour lunch.  The rolls and sashimi were good.  The famous screaming orgasm wasn't as good as I was expecting, given its reputation.  The yellowtail and salmon sashimi were excellent.  Buttery pieces of fish that had excellent flavor.  Good quality and prepared properly.  Decent beer selection.  We will definitely be back.",

Service: The place is full nearly every single time I walk in, but they still manage to greet our party and get us seated as quickly as they can. We are offered pickled ginger, wasabi, edamame, and a cucumber salad within seconds. Drink orders are taken and delivered equally quickly. Our drinks are always full, our dishes are taken away as they are emptied leaving room for more dishes to arrive, and we are accommodated with special requests (my daughter loves vegetable rolls with only certain items and they are very nice about putting it together for her). We were even treated kindly when we had a shellfish allergy at the table; they made sushi and a roll on a separate area and were careful about serving it separately. Hot, damp towels are brought at the end of the meal, which is nice.  Meal: Orders are taken as often as you like (you can order piece by piece or all at once, they don't mind either way). Food is brought out fast, fresh, and beautifully presented. The chefs are so much fun to watch that I always try to either sit at the bar or seat myself facing them. I have literally NEVER had a piece of sushi, a roll, or any other dish that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I always finish up with an oyster shooter because it's like a cherry on the sundae. *It's hard to say some of the names of the rolls to the server with a straight face, but I try anyway*  Price: Very reasonable for the quality of food offered. I gave it a $$$ simply because our party always orders drinks and a slew of fancy rolls. You do NOT have to spend that much to have a great experience.  Overall: I Love Sushi is on my shortlist of all time favorites. I spent my last 2 birthdays there and many a date night and family out night in between. I will be back!",

I've lived in Las Vegas for over 12 years and I keep coming back to I Love Sushi for the best Sushi experience. The focus is the on quality of food, not showmanship. It's in a small anonymous strip mall but it's worth coming to even if you live in the Northwest corner of the valley. You won't be disappointed.",

I was supposed to eat whatever I wanted as my cheat meal for a really restrictive high protein, essentially no carbs, diet. I ended up ordering seared tuna that was served with half an avocado and marinated red onions... essentially not what I was supposed to do. But man, it was really good. A++ would order again.",

What it boils down to is Grade A raw fish and this place delivers! This place is consistent and since it opened has been serving some of the best sushi and sashimi in town. Added bonus that it's right down the street from my house.    The place went through some beautiful renovations in the last two years and is now even bigger. Bolder and more attractive colors. Some of my favorites: Flower roll, Ryan's roll, Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi with spicy ponzu sauce, Yellowtail comma, and the lunch bento box specials are solid as well.",

If you like the litany of sexy body parts and earthly dragon named sushi that are extreme variations of traditional sushi, then this is the place for you.  I prefer more traditional and authentic sushi and so it is hard really to taste the flavors of the sushi in a restaurant like this because the sauces and fried stuff and mixture is kinda overpowering.  But hey, I like to have ketchup on my steak once in a while, and so, I have come here several times and will come again as it ain't bad, but it really isn't real Japanese food, it is blended to the American taste.....",

I am a True fan of authentic Japanse food and sushi but the chefs here put a twist to all your favorites...its like your fantasy sushi and roll combinations coming True.  I had the Triple X roll ,Mistake roll ,Kimchii roll, and Orgasm roll and i put them down in order of preference. The Triple X is most definitely the best roll i have had since i was put on God's green earth.  I don't think the pictures i took came out right, but then again my saliva glands and my mouth was on a trip so i cant blame my hands for wanting to drop the phone and get back to feasting.  Had a few Sake bombs and yet the bill wasn't ridiculous at all. I know its not on the Vegas strip but i highly recommend you take the detour.",

Ive eaten here dozens of times because I know its easy to get to, is a huge restaurant (so its pretty easy to get a table), has a huge selection, and I know everyone can find something they will like.  The fish is always fresh, but never mindblowing. The servers are always somewhere between rushed and friendly, but never rude. The portions are large, the prices are on the mid-high end and the presentations are always interesting. Because it is so popular there is sometimes a wait, especially on weekend evenings, but it has never been too long. Sometimes the front counter people can get a bit snippy, but overall this is a very safe bet where I have never had any issues and have always come out satisfied.",
