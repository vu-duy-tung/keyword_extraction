I do wish the breakfast menu had a little more to it but they do still serve the lunch / dinner menu in the morning. Now, I wouldn't say it's the healthiest food but it was darn good! Worth every calorie.   We sat at the bar and the bartender, Sam, was great. He was very friendly and asked how our trip had been etc. and was attentive from beginning to end.   Chili cheese fries and grilled cheese were fire and the breakfast sandwich was one of the best I've had. Awesome experience, we will definitely be back next time we come out to visit.",

Ketchup is a unique mix of a fast food like burger joint and a bar. Casual, on the cheap and accessible. And be warned, their burgers are BIG!  We had Ketchup classic with caramelized onion, and Vegas dog. Not bad, but not great either. Fries were unimpressive. Perfectly fits my definition of 3 stars.",

    "text": "More of a 3.5 stars, but let's talk some quick tips:  1. The pricing for the burgers do not include fries and a drink. However, you can upgrade any meal for an additional $3.99.  2. At the time of writing this review, they had a deal for $10.00 for a draft beer and their most basic burger.  3. There are MANY different types of ketchup (hence the name!). We tried every single type and we found that we really liked the Garlic ketchup.  4. The drinks that are served here used the new aged drink machines that offer many different choices!  5. The patties cannot be cooked to medium rare!  This place is located very close to the parking lot near the back of Planet Hollywood. I had no idea how very new this place was. A few of my friends and I were walking down and through the Miracle Mile shops and saw this place and decided to give it a try.  My girlfriend and I tried the Western Burger. It was basically a burger with bacon, cheese, and barbecue sauce. For the burger, we felt that the meat didn't seem to be seasoned enough. In fact, the barbecue sauce seemed to be very overpowering. The bacon was standard bacon that you could probably find in most restaurant burgers.  We also ordered the combo fries meal. The fries were pretty standard stuff, nothing really extraordinary. Just normal fries. The portion were good for sharing with another person. I think the star though is their different types of ketchup. We tried garlic ketchup, sriracha ketchup, hickory ketchup and, balsamic ketchup. They also offered Ranch as well as Fries sauce. By far, our favorite was the garlic ketchup. The rest of the different ketchups seem to not really vary in taste. What I mean is that the ketchup doesn't seem to add or subtract from the extra ingredient--sriracha ketchup tastes like sriracha, but a tiny bit sweeter.  The best part of the combo was the drink selection. They have the new coke machines with the multiple combinations. I tried peach flavored sprite! As for service, you order at the counter and then they bring you your food, not really much but they were pretty friendly.  All in all, the only problem I have with this place is that it seems pretty forgettable. When you have one of the best sandwich spots in Vegas just a few short minutes away (Earl's Sandwich), then you got to make your food really memorable. Still it is relatively cheap when compared to other Vegas options, and the lines are not out the door.  Still, I hope you try this new business out and let them know what you think!",

    "text": "Taste-wise, the burgers at Ketchup are great as far as fast food burgers go. The only problem is that it's almost the same price as a some of the gourmet burger spots around town.   I ordered the Big Bleu Burger ($12) and my girlfriend ordered the Morning Glory ($12). Both burgers were satisfying. The meat quality was above most fast food chains, and the ingredients tasted fresh. Aptly, Ketchup has a variety of different ketchups that you can choose from. I'd highly recommend the balsamic ketchup or the hickory ketchup.  But Ketchup burgers are far from gourmet--although they want to be so badly. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes great, but it's not worth $12 a burger (and that's without fries or a drink). We had a Groupon, so we thought we'd try it out. But honestly, I'd rather pay an extra $2 per person and get a True gourmet burger at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, which is literally in the same building.  I could have easily given this place 2 stars, but as a standalone burger joint, I couldn't complain about any of the food.   This place is great if you want to spend the same amount on a fast food burger as you do on a gourmet burger. But honestly, Carl's Jr. has the same type of burgers for half the price. I get that it's Las Vegas, and this place also has a full bar attached to it, but part of eating on a budget is being wise when choosing a place to eat. Heck, even if you're not on a budget, it just makes sense to go to a better burger spot for the same price. Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is not a wise decision in either situation. It's great if you have a Groupon, but otherwise, just go to BurGR down the hall.",

The patty was a little over cooked and the egg on the burger was overlooked as well.  When I asked for water, they said I had to get it from the bar. Couldn't get it from the soda machine for some reason. So there is only one girl working at the bar and she is busy pouring drinks so I wait for a couple minutes and ask for some water. When we go to get a refill because it's a small plastic cup. It's another few minute wait while our food is over there getting cold. There is a much better method to this. Have a self serve water tap and/or put water in the soda machine.",

Speaking of the drinks, they were delicious! His shake tasted just like fruit loops but I have to say that my strawberry shortcake shake was even better. I would recommend that two people split a shake though if you're both getting a burger (or sharing a burger if you're both getting a shake?), the combination left me so full.",

    "text": "We always pass by this place in PH's Miracle Mile, and thought maybe one day we'll try it because of the cute Heinz ketchup bottle trashcans. The place was always empty, but can't be TOO bad, right?  That day came this weekend when we saw a sign at the sport's memorabilia shop across from Ketchup that said Mike Tyson was doing a meet a greet. We got there a bit early to scope it out, and since there was no lines, we looked for places to eat for lunch. Ketchup was the closest.  We ordered the LA Dog and Ketchup Classic Burger. For being a self proclaimed \"premium burger bar\", I was surprised they didn't ask how I wanted my burger cooked. I guess well done it is.   Didn't get to try my bf's hotdog (he said it's fine), but my burger was surprising OK! They have a selection of flavored ketchups by the counter, and my burger went well with the garlic ketchup. Burgers were a good size for a quick lunch, but were pricey for foodcourt-like ambiance.  Service at the cashier was abysmal. The girl looked like she hated her job or we did something to offend her. We ordered in, and she didn't give us a number for our order (everyone else had one). I asked if we needed one and she gave me some random one off the counter with the blankest look on her face. OK? My apologies for trying to make your jobs easier. (BTW, the number didn't do a thing; they still didn't know where to deliver the food esp since it didn't correspond to anything!)  Also, Mike Tyson was a no show for the meet and greet across from Ketchup. Just the cherry we needed to top off our mediocre experience at the Miracle Mile that day.   Won't be returning to Ketchup. If you want burgers at PH, please go to GR's Burgr just a few steps away in the same hotel. Well worth the few extra dollars for real premium and real service.",

Right after we were done eating, a worker came and took our trash and asked how the food was. Overall, I LOVED LOVED LOVED their service!

You place your order at the counter, Get an order number,  & your order will be brought to table.  This place is located at 410 at the Miracle Mile shops There are weekly specials, Tuesdays: buy one get one free hot dogs. ( Which they ran out of)  My opinion: this place is a bit pricey!!  Burger does not come with fries. We got 2 burgers,  Gordon Blue Burger: 12.05-w/out fries. Buffalo chicken sandwich-12.30.  (Comes with 2 piece of chicken tender on a bun, along with feta cheese, buffalo sauce, lettuce, & tomato) I did not like the feta cheese!! -I'm not sure if this is a mistake? It doesn't go well together!  I paid 4.00 more to make it a combo.  The fries were small portions!!  Over-all our burger was mediocre!! The prices you pay for burger is not worth the price!!   The 2 reason that I enjoy most about this place: 1. The soda machine, I call it the iPad soda machine, it's pretty cool dispensing the drinks. Just press the category and the type of drinks you would like and your drink will be ready. I got a Fanta Orange with sprite drink. 2. I like the concept of ketchup, this is why the place is called ketchup-premium. I like that there are many different flavored ketchup. Ex. Spiracha ketchup, hickory ketchup, buffalo ketchup.   It was an experience!! I will be back for the fries & ketchup & the fountain drinks!! Maybe the burgers!?",

    "text": "I feel like this place has potential but is possibly not managed correctly. I dont remember the name of the burger I got but it was a breakfast one with a fried egg, hash brown, and bacon. Both times I've gone here I've gotten this burger. The taste and cook of the burger was delicious however both times we went here the egg was not fried it was fully cooked which kind of ruined the purpose of having a fried egg on your burger. I went here with two friends who did not eat but they ordered shakes instead. We waited thirty five minutes for my burger (not packed inside) and they did not bring the shakes out. We waited fifteen more minutes and finally my friends decided to walk up to the counter to see if they had forgotten about the shakes, even though they said they didn't. I decided to just eat and finish my meal and even after demolishing my burger and fries their shakes STILL were not out yet. Finally after going to the counter again they finally brought out the shakes which were terrible. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEIR SHAKES. I'm not over exaggerating it was literally like water blended with ice and a dab of chocolate syrup. So overpriced for the super low quality shake you get. We could've just saved money and gone to a fast food restaurant for a better quality. Other than terrible food and service, the place didn't run smoothly. All the employees seemed confused constantly about who ordered what or what came with someone else's order. No one seemed to be communicating with each other. And it was very visible just by observing their Dynamics and interactions with other guests. Overall I will never be returning here but hopefully to another location!",

    "text": "I was beyond disappointed in this joint. I got a Groupon, and before you even think it, I have got a lot of Groupon's, for good and decent restaurants. BUT this was one of those you're like why did i do this to myself. I figured a head of time I'm gonna be staying at Planet Hollywood, why not try this place out for lunch or dinner?   Well my Boyfriend and I came and ordered our food it was probably around 6- 6:30 pm, and I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he ordered some kind of Teryaki Hawaiian Burger, we split a fry and he got a drink.   It didn't take long to come to our table. But in the mean time he got his drink after them being out of Cherry Coke, and Vanilla Coke flavors, and was TRYING to get some of their different kinds of ketchup they are supposed to be known for our at least is the their whole marketing idea, but oh no they were practically all empty. The maple bacon one, the hickory, and so on. So at this place that is supposed to have some good Ketchup to go with your sandwiches and fries, we had to get plain, old regular ketchup, what a shame right?  So our food came and my buffalo chicken sandwich was not a chicken patty, it was two chicken fingers on a bun, and COVERED, and I mean buffalo  OVERLOAD of sauce, so disgusting it made me not want to eat it as soon as he put it in front of me. It had sauce all over the bottom bun live covered, about to be a BIG soggy,nasty,mess. I' m like it dude, if it taste gross I'm going to need another bun, and the employee looked at me like I'm crazy and he didn't understand why? And they weren't busy, at all.   My boyfriend's were also covered in that Teriyaki sauce, way too much, don't do that lazy cooks, not cool. If I would've known that I would've asked for no sauce or sauce on the side.  Overall, on vacation you just wanna have good food and good time, and this was a bad time and bad mediocre food that tasted like it was from a bowling alley.",

    "text": "This review based on tonight's experience while waiting for our food to be served.  First and foremost, the evening staff SUCKS! It's as if everyone hates their job here, including the crappy manager, who I respectfully asked if they can replace the garlic ketchup.   His response \"we only make enough ketchup to last the day\"   How is your company named \"Ketchup PREMIUM Burger Bar\" but I have yet to see the premium, and the ketchup bar is 50% empty. Come on, quit your job if you can't provide good customer service.   To the owner: you should expect a vast amount of foot traffic being at the entrance to the parking garage on a Friday night, but I see exactly why people go to the BURGR joint at the casino, who will wait in line for the extensive customer service. You should witness the staff for yourself and see why you're losing easy money in a hotel that's full of local and tourist shoppers.   Waiter just walked up to me and gave me honesty by saying \"the girls in the back are very backed up but they can work on making more ketchup in a bit, I will let you know when they do\"   I'll take honesty over a bull sh!t excuse that they only make enough sauce to last a day, on a flipping Friday dude. Come on. Lamest excuse ever from a MANAGER.   AND THATS JUST A REVIEW FOR SERVICE.  The food:  I got the loco moco. I love egg on my burgers, but even my wife agrees with her ketchup class burger that the food tastes rushed. I would rather have a nice drive thru burger from Wendy's than this joke.   Don't come here and waste your money. The good reviews are probably from drunk tourist, who don't know burgers.",

You must bring cash.  The only way that you may use your debit card or credit card is if you have a transaction higher than $15. 2.  A 22 ounce milkshake with absolutely no left overs is $7.17 3.  A single patty cheese burger is $9.19; and a ultimate chesse burger  is $18.00 4. A side of fries is $3.00; and a basket of fries is $5.00  So, ultimately two of use slip a ultimate cheese burger,  a basket of fries and two glasses of water for a total of $24.00 .  My overall suggestions is to take the walk to Gordon Ramsey's  Burger restaurant  or find a Fudruckers.",

It was a convenient place to go to for food and it also has a bar. I went on a Saturday and most the people there were also there for the concert. I ordered the Morning Glory burger with sweet potato fries. I think I got lucky with my burger because it was so delicious. It was everything I love about breakfast (my favorite meal) served on top of a juicy burger. The sweet potato fries were pretty badly overcooked so I did not enjoy those. The food is extremely pricy for burgers, but not uncommon for food prices on the strip. Service is pretty slow and it is somewhat like In N Out where you order, then wait for them to call your number and you grab your food. I would have given only 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't give the option.",

My husband ordered the Western burger - again crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, onion crisps and a BBQ ketchup.  Both of us had fries so we can check out the ketchup bar and the fries were well seasoned and hot and crispy!  The ketchup bar... wow!  You name it - they have it.  I can't remember all of them but our top 2 were the BBQ ketchup and the maple bacon ketchup.  I remember also a curry ketchup, balsamic ketchup, and a fry sauce.

We'd frequently come back late at night and find this place open so it became our go-to spot for our late night meal. The burgers are delicious and the french fries are perfect. The best part is the owner is as nice as can be. He appreciated us constantly coming back and treated us to free drinks at the bar. Make sure you check this place out!",

My wife had the corn dog, she really liked it, it was crispy on the outside, and the bread on the inside was still soft without being chewy.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you have to buy everything separately.  Yes, you have combo options but I still think everything is overpriced. Plus with all the options you have in the casino you might find a cheaper place to eat. Being there the first time I really enjoy it so if you want a quick bite is not a bad place to stop and eat.",

    "text": "The space is quite large considering I've never seen too many people at once in any venue within their shopping mall. There is a bar at the outside corner with about 8 stools inside and a counter facing out for take away beverages, plus a number of 2- and 4-top tables throughout and another high top long table with 10 seats. Ordering is a bit confusing; there were a few iPads at the front on a stand in a self-ordering section, but they weren't working the day of my visit so I was guided to one of the registers alongside them. The drink station is way in the back corner of the restaurant next to a large rack of their unlabeled generic hamburger buns and cases of beer. The menu features quite a selection of pre-designed burgers, dogs, virgin and spiked shakes as well as several types of fries. Also, for a place with the word 'ketchup' in its name, you'd expect a larger selection than the four that I was able to choose from, with one being generic ketchup flavor.  Trying to keep my burger fairly simple to sample what they're capable of, I went with the mushroom Swiss burger: Angus beef patty, grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese and mayo. Upon first bite I was able to identify a completely generic beef patty; it was cooked ok but tasted like something you'd get at a ballpark and not what you'd expect for a 'premium' burger bar. The onions completely overpowered most of the flavors, and were a bit undercooked for my taste. The bun looked overdone, but was actually fresh and pretty good considering its generic presence. The half-melted cheese didn't have a great presence, and the mushrooms were probably less noticeable than the mayo. Overall there was nothing good about this burger.  The fries were of the slightly thick cut, definitely generic frozen variety. They were seasoned with your typical fry seasoning and totally undercooked. Also the oil flavor was possibly a little foul even considering this was fairly early in the day. Not only was the burger and fries not great, but this meal with a drink came to a whopping $16.19! I don't remember being told what my total was at the time of ordering, and wasn't even given a receipt after my purchase. I usually come at these meals ready to spend whatever it takes to do my review, but when I logged into my account later to see the amount I was shocked based on what I was given. Evaluating this meal on that price is bad enough, but when you consider that BurGR is just down the hall in the casino, I could not recommend that you buy a burger here.",

I clearly saw the word Nutella so we tried to take a picture of it and show it to her, when I came to ask her about it again, she looked up and went back to what she was doing, when she was done she came to me without asking anything. I asked her again if the store had this, at first she said no then she told me to go the bartender to ask for it... okeee... oh and I didnt forget to catch her name, its Gloria.",

I went here on a Groupon worth 20 dollars, but I still had to shell out an extra 18 dollars for only two meals (burger, fries and a drink).  It felt pretty expensive, for such a low quality product. The workers were very friendly, but this is VEGAS, you can throw a rock and hit a better burger place. Try Fuku Burger 10 mins off the strip its a far better choice a super innovative and delicious spot.

Condiments were on a side wall, which included different types of ketchup--a first for me. I had to ask for mayonnaise and don't know why they don't keep the packs out with the ketchup and mustard packs. I wish they could've seasoned the burger a bit...oh well. The service wasn't bad or great. I don't know if I would go back.",

Ordered a standard cheese burger with fries.  Burger was way over cooked and was obviously a pre-frozen hockey puck.  The bun was not bread as much as it was styrofoam.  Ate half of it.  Fries were actually quite good.  Cooked crispy and salty and fresh.  The wide selection of ketchup was also a nice touch. With all the other great options out there I see why they offer a groupon to get people to try them out.",

It may be a *bit* pricier and take a little longer, but the overall quality will at least make you feel like you got your money's worth. If all you're looking for a quick snack and a beer, this place will probably do the trick, but don't make it meal.  -- I've been here twice now and despite its excellent location just inside the main Miracle Mile Shops on the 3rd floor, each visit left me underwhelmed. The best perk the first time around was their 2-for-1 drink special, but this time I forwent the alcohol and just ordered a burger and some fries (both ridiculously overpriced, even for Vegas.)   The fries came out almost right away, but the burger took about 15 minutes to get to me...even though I could see it sitting there, growing cold and lonely at the window behind the cash wrap.  To their credit, the guy felt awful for forgetting it and offered me a free item from the menu for the wait, but the burger was so off-putting (so much bread...) that I didn't even want to take him up on his offer. In fact, I actually felt nauseous for several hours after eating it. It just wasn't...good.   Their ketchup selection is pretty fun, so if I was to return, it would be just to order their fries and maybe try a Boozy Milkshake, but that's it.",

Got two different burgers and split them so we could try more than one. I liked that they had different flavored ketchups and got a few to try as well, excited about flavors. To be honest though, the best part of all of it was the egg or the bun. The burger was pretty plain and I wouldn't pay $9-12 again for it. It wasn't bad but nothing to seek out and go back for for me. The ketchup flavors were okay for spice but unless you load it on the burger you don't really taste the flavors so much of garlic or such. I'd prefer a cheaper burger elsewhere or pick a different place if I'm paying that much for this burger.",

    "text": "Geez where to start. I really have nothing good to say about this place. I failed to read the reviews before stepping in, my fail, lesson learned! Read the Yelp reviews people!  So this place has a Heinz them with branded trash cans, logos and other borrowed details but it seems they use the name but not the product, bate and switch seems to be a consistent theme, read on...  I order a $17 double bacon cheese burger, the double priced premium hand battered Zuccinni and a soft drink.  Lets start with the staff; no hello, no smile, no thank you for your order. Instead of service I get a flat toned, mumbling and annoyed stiff that seemed put out that she had to talk to me and who offered nothing in the way of help or friendliness.   Dismayed, I take my number and turn the corner to see a row of flavored ketchups, including Fry sauce which I had to try as everyone in my family likes it. I also grabbed a sample of balsamic ketchup, it tasted like dark colored ketchup nothing special. Fry sauce was bland but tasted sort of what I expected.   Next up soft drinks: mostly standard, the only diet choice was diet coke, this is a Las Vegas problem as Coke seems to have the town under it's thumb and only diet coke is offered in many places. I always find that odd for a place that prides itself on broad choices and variety. I visit many small, backwood, nowhere towns that have far more variety in soda choices but this is really not Ketchup's fault I guess just a Vegas thing.  I did not try the bar, but since it only had one patron the whole time I was there it did not make me think it was anything to get excited about.   My food came out after a few minutes and the burger looked good and it was large (see picture) but the pluses stop there. The burger was bland and tasteless, worse they did not even get it right. I was specific about what I wanted on it (or did not want) and they seemed to reverse it. Maybe the annoyed and disinterested order taker could not be bothered to get it right or maybe today was opposite day. The meat was hard, over worked and over cooked with no taste. It was like the taste of fatty grocery store beef it you browned it and tasted it before seasoning. It was just cheap over worked meat not even grilled for broiled. There was a lot of it but so what more does not equal better. Bacon had a decent smoky flavor but undercooked, wet, and fatty. I could not finish it, not because it was too big but because it simply gaged me, it was terrible. I would have been happier with Sonic, Burger King or the local gas station heat lamp burger.  Now onto the premium, hand-breaded zucchini. Staying consistent these were ridiculously bad. Think generic grocery store, frozen, fried zucchini. Tasteless, heavy, poorly battered, clearly machine processed and not fresh at all. They should be embarrassed to call these premium. I did not eat much of them either before feeling sick and regretting my meal. I left feeling bloated and a little sick to my stomach.  So there you have it, stolen branding or bait and switch on the Heinz theme, terrible ingredients on the burger and poorly prepared, and frozen, cheapo, generic grocery store fried zuccini. What a terrible deal but at least they charged me $27 plus tax!   I'll never be back, if you come upon this place, divert your eyes, keep walking, make the kids look away and run for the nearest exits. Save your wallet save your stomach. And hey Heinz if your really sponsoring this place you need to shut it down and protect your good name.",

The people who work here are quite accommodating. I came here wanting to try a burger and not just any burger on the menu. I want a chicken burger. The good thing is they can make a special custom order. So I chose the Hawaiian Burger with pineapple, chicken, mac n cheese. If I had a name for it, I would call it a \"Hula Chick-n-Mac.\" It's an unusual combination but that's how I like it. When it was prepared on my first visit, it was a juicy, tender chicken breast with a good amount of mac n cheese, and it was delicious! But on my second visit, I ordered the same thing and I was a bit disappointed. There was less mac n cheese, and instead of having the lettuce place on the bottom of my burger bun (like the first visit) they had the lettuce on top, which cause the sauce to soak on the bottom bun and it was messy to eat. I had high hopes for this place but they need to make some improvement on their burger. The consistency and quality of food should always be of utmost priority.",

After you park the car and enter from the back, it's the first thing you see to your right.  We got there pretty late, around 8 or 9pm. There were two other tables being occupied, so it was dead. We walked up to the counter and put in our orders. There was a young teenage boy working the cashier and he was helpful. I asked about the different burgers and he explained them to me.  I chose the Big Bleu Burger and upgraded to a meal for $4.39 more, which came with fries and a drink. The hubby had the Ketchup Classic and subbed the beef patty for the chicken breast. My Big Bleu was so delicious! It was an angus beef patty, topped with bleu cheese, bacon, caramelized onion, and garlic aioli. I was going to put one of their fancy ketchups on it, but I didn't have to. It was perfect on its own.  The reason I wanted to try this place was because of all their different ketchups, hence the name. They have four ketchups to be exact with two sauces: buffalo sauce, fry sauce, hickory ketchup, balsamic ketchup, original ketchup, and sriracha ketchup.  The hickory ketchup had a burnt taste to it. The balsamic was sweet and the siriracha was spicy. My two favorites were the balsamic and the fry sauce. The fry sauce went great with the fries. It was like the Thousand Island dressing with a hint of sweetness to it.",

Fries soggy, onion rings so so.  Ketchup sauces, nothing so special at all. Best part, soda bar, choose coke or diet coke and get perhaps 8 options of each with different flavors. Won't be back. Bobby Flay's Burger Place down the street is so much better.",

Since they don't give water cups at the counter we were told to go to the bar for water so we did but apparently we bugged her because she completely tolled her eyes and gave us a snotty attitude as if we were bothering her. We were actually going to order drinks but after that no way. We just wanted to get out of there. So rude. Never going back and telling people to avoid her.",

Than I get my burgers 35 min later and sure enough all has chili. So I asked the employee again dose the chili has lard? She said WHATS THAT? I said pork fat. She said I don't know. I asked her please could you ask? She did and came back telling me yes it dose!!! I told her I'm sorry   I can't have it if I eat anything has lard I will end up in the hospital due to allergy. Employee replied \"but you ordered it\" I said I'm sorry but I can't eat it. Also reminded her about me asking her before ordering!!! She kept arguing. I asked for the manager it was another female who also gave me a lecture about it's my fault and pretty much I have to suck it up!!! I told her instead of telling me it's my fault you should educate your employees that lard is pork.  I got my money back after the manager throw the food in front of me with attitude. Trying to make me feel bad.  Horrible service and staff. Let's add overpriced.",

Any couple that goes out in this town and DOESN'T split a meal is out of their mind. The portions in any restaurant in this town are so huge, two people can eat one meal. That being said, my husband and I were here this past Friday night and LOVED this place. They have a special for 11.99 where you get a beer and classic Ketchup burger. This worked out great for us because I wasn't up for beer, my husband wanted beer and we split the burger and an order of sweet potato fries. Yes, $5.09 might seem expensive for an order of fries, but the order was so big the two of us couldn't eat the whole thing. Try these little bits of heaven with the maple bacon ketchup AND kudos to the super sweet waitress who gave us a side of vanilla ice cream to go with the fries. . .OMG! All in all, we got out of their for around $20.00, which is pretty great considering their prices and we had beer. The burger was fantastic, by the way. Again, if you go to most restaurants in this town on the strip or in a prime location, you're going to pay a premium. But if you do it right, you can get out of any restaurant reasonably.",

We were excited to try all the different ketchup dipping sauces and the drink machine was awesome with all the different selections! Prices were good and the atmosphere was fun. They have several TV's where you can enjoy a game & a bar section if you want to have a drink. We sat next to some Canadian tourists who raved about the fact that they could get a great burger & beer for only $10. Overall we really enjoyed Ketchup & look forward to taking the kids and trying the rest of the food on their menu.",

    "text": "Have lived in  Vegas  for  2 years.  Been  in  the Miracle  Mile shops before and saw Ketchup.  It looked like a fun place but wasn't craving a burger.  Amazon  Local had a deal for it so I  thought I would take advantage while  my wife and Kids were out of town.  I had $22 to spend so I was sat at the bar (of course).  Cheryl was the bartender and very enthusiastic.  She recommended the burger and beer deal for $10.  Sounded good to me (although I had to add bacon to it).  So I have only spend $10 of $22 at this point so I am doing great.  Added on $3 fries. $13.  I still have $9.  Cocktail I say.  Whiskey Sour please.  Cheryl says that is $10 or $10 with a souvenir cup same quantity of booze.  But I can bring it back and get a drink in it for $5.  Deal.  Ok so I am at $23 bucks not bad.  1/2 way through the experience I show her my Amazon deal.  She says that due to the Burger and Beer Deal I can't get that discounted.  Oh crap I should have mentioned this when I first sat down.  My fault.  Ended up using the $10 to get 2 32oz PBR's.  So I spent a little more than I wanted to but I was definitely \"buzzed\" after that experience.  The burger was good and the Cheryl was hilarious.  A lot of people had Groupons  and Amazon Local deals (hope they mention it first thing).  I will be back even without a deal",

Let me start by saying I felt the food was way overpriced for what you got. There's also a $15 minimum to use credit cards.  I got the regular ketchup burger and it was okay at best. Along with it ordered onion rings and those weren't good. The dough from the onion rings wasn't crunchy all the way through, the parts closer to the interior tasted very bready which made the onion rings a lot less palatable. They come with a variety of different ketchup flavors but after a while they all started tasting like bad BBQ sauce.  This is just one of those places where I go in, and I know it's probably not going to be that great, but when I actually have it it ends up being worst than I imagined and overpriced to boot.",

I mean i get that its vegas and things Are just pricier in general but i mean $20 for a burger n fries n drink is pretty steep   2. Its sort of a fast food joint so paying $40 for a couple i felt like i paid restaurant prices at a in n out.   3. They charge for everything!!!! I spent $40 got 5 different things then asked for ranch and they said its $.50... Are u kidding me!!??   4. The cashier didnt really care about what he was doing.. Didnt help us with anything.. He had our food sitting under the hear lamps for so long i went up and asked to get them... My chili cheese fries were so cold i asked them to mKe new ones. So i put a little onion on top to mark it to see if it'll be there when they brought it back and sure enough it was there!!!   There is nothing special about this place.. If you dont have a deal or a group on DO NOT PAY FULL PRiCE!!!",

(we were surprised to find how few restaurants and eateries actually open past 10 or 11pm in Vegas.) - Those choose your own flavor sodas machines - you know, the ones with like 17 buttons that you can make your own grape flavored Sprite or something. this one even has diet Barq's! ;) - Two for One Draft or fountain drink for HaPpy HouR - good for beer, but if you're just getting a fountain drink, just use the \"make it a meal\" option, which makes your drink essentially free with your fries.  Fair: - My sweet potato fries were good - for the half that were actually properly cooked. the other half should've stayed in the fryer longer :( The gals there were nice enough that if I asked, they'd probably make a new batch for me. But it was a lot of food, and I didn't really need more.  If it's hard to see the prices on the pictures, here's the gist of it that's not on their website - prices:  - BURGERS are about $9 for a hamburger to $13 fancy schmancy.  - Sandwiches, Salads, Chicken Tenders $6-7 - Fancy-named hot dogs $6-8  - ADD cheese for $1 (a bit steep, but considering i was adding it to a $9 burger, it wasn't too bad), bacon or chili for $1.50, jalapeno, grilled mushroom, or caramelized onion for $0.75  - Milkshakes $7, SPIKED shakes $9  - Sides:      @ fries $3.99 (add fries and soda to meal $4.49     @ sweet potato fries $4.99 (add it AND soda to meal still $4.99 - no joke. that's how i ordered it. sweet ;) right?)     @ \"panko crusted\" onion rings (didn't taste that different from regular onion rings, sorry!) $ 5.99  I didn't come across any prob with service. It was ordered at the counter, put your number on the table, they bring you food, they later clear your food as you finish, but you refill your own fountain drinks - type of thing. We weren't pressured to tip. Got luckier than at least one other reviewer I guess?",

    "text": "Ketchup is a fast casual burger restaurant located inside of the Planet Hollywood at the Miracle Mile Shops. Do yourself a favor and snag one of the coupon books from the information desk in the middle of the mall, this will save you some $$$.  Service- The cashier was friendly and patient with the 5 of us, as we all had coupons and he had to ring each order up separately. The coupon was for a free order of fries and soda with the purchase of a burger. The food was done really quick which is a good and a bad thing. Good because we were hungry, but bad because if food is coming out that quick it must be sitting on a grill or in a warmer.  Ketchup- Along the side wall there was is a self serve area that includes a ketchup bar with 6 different sauce pumps, 4 of them were ketchup flavors. They had sriracha, balsamic, hickory and regular ketchup as well as buffalo and fry sauces. I thought they were all okay but preferred the fry sauce best. They also have the Freestyle Coke machine.  Food-  I ordered the Mac Attack burger ($12+)  described on the menu as \"angus patty, fried macaroni and cheese patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, garlic aioli.\" They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and it came out almost well done. This leads me to believe my theory of food sitting on the grill/warmer is correct. Luckily the toppings made the burger edible. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese patty because it was melty and cheesy and added some really good flavor. The garlic aioli was minimal but tasty and worked well with the other toppings. And of course the bacon was good but I would have preferred it to be more crispy. My meal came with a generous amount of fries and they were okay but they weren't hot.  I am sure glad they were free because they are almost $5 for a small side. Yeah I know we are on the strip but that is ridonkulous. My dining complains all had a different burger and while we all agreed they were edible, we were glad we had the coupon and we wouldn't come back.",

We sat at the bar so we could watch football and the bartender was very friendly.  My fiance got the Big Blue Burger and I ordered a Grilled Cheese, we shared the Blue Cheese Buffalo Fries. The food was good! The burger tasted fresh and was served hot (I hate being served cold food, so that made me happy) the Grilled Cheese was pretty good too, but the cheese wasn't real, think Kraft ... But didn't expect real cheese anyway, just an FYI. The prices are expensive .. $6 for a plain old grilled cheese. The side of fries were like $7.99 .... The burger $10 which was kind of reasonable ... I don't know, everything is expensive on the Strip I guess.   The sriracha  ketchup, tasty! Place was clean, we would maybe come back if we return to Vegas.",

My boyfriend and I both agreed that the curry ketchup is really where it's at (so hey don't be afraid to try it ! )    The alcoholic milkshakes should almost be illegal they are so good. We got the tipsy gorilla and honestly it just felt like I was enjoying a dessert.   Overall, this is going to be one of my new fav places. Worth a try ! We used a group on too!",

There's an assortment of ketchup, like garlic and Sriracha. The garlic ketchup looked and tasted watered down, and the Sriracha ketchup was just...well, Sriracha and ketchup mixed together.

The main selling point for Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is that they carry different flavors of ketchup. This last visit, the ketchup selection was low and not as impressive as my previous visit. I think they only had  four different ketchups to choose from: regular ketchup; hickory; siracha; and buffalo sauce.  I ordered the Big Bleu Burger and the burger itself did not taste fresh, it tasted like it was frozen prior to cooking. The only saving grace for this restaurant was the bartender, she was awesome and made drinks pretty fast.

Deep fried bacon cheese balls, that were hot on the crust, and cold on the inside. Sweet potato fries....with cinnamon???? Interesting concept...not well executed. I won't be back.",

Just shoot me now. This wasn't how I imagined to spend my money in Vegas. The wait was pretty long too for food and to order...  On the side, you can get your soda and a variety of ketchups. There were garlic, sriracha, balsamic, chipotle, jalapeno, and hickory. I tried the garlic and hickory, neither of which I fancied... Very faint flavoring  My friend and I shared a Mac Attack comboed with large Garlic Parm Fries and Oreo Milkshake. I have to hand it to them, the milkshake was pretty bomb. It's more ice cream than milk, which I prefer. It's nothing like a McFlurry. The Mac Attack was super oily and pretty small... Not a lot of flavor in it either. I need more aioli. The fries were crispy, which is a plus, and not very garlicky. It was a pretty huge portion. My friend and I weren't able to finish the large fries so I recommend a regular size.  All in all, this was a pretty expensive meal... I can't imagine the bill that large family next to us had to pay...",

I sat for 4 minutes before the bartender acknowledged me. Then he came over and dropped a menu and then proceeded to help other people. He got their drinks and order in before he even gave me the time of day and I was there first.   Told the bartender I was allergic to tomatoes and he proceeded to give me a cup to go get my own ketchup.................let that sink in  I saw him pouring the company liquor into his own drink cup. Yes guests can see and notice these things.  Girl who dropped the food said \"here you go\" and walked away. Didn't smile or ask if I needed anything else.  Reason I gave it two stars was the burger. The mac and cheese burger was pretty good. Nothing amazing but solid burger. So the kitchen at least did something good.",

But what's the point for coming to Planet Hollywood Resort for a burger joint like this when there's Gordon Ramsay's \"Burger\" just a few steps down the way on the casino level?  Ordered the Hot Mess burger. It came with chili, jalapenos, cheese and some kind of avocado spread. I specifically asked for it to be well done. Ordered a side of parmesan garlic fries to share. Boyfriend ordered a crispy chicken wrap. The burger meat ended up to be pink. That's definitely not well done. How is well done still pink?! Strike 1. Brought it back but when it was brought back to the table the second time around, my parmesan garlic fries were replaced with regular fries. Ugh. Strike 2. The quality of food does not justify the prices here. Strike 3. For a few bucks more, I could head over to a gourmet burger restaurant and receive better quality food.  The pink meat when I specifically asked for WELL DONE was enough for me to knock off two stars. Biting into that was enough to make me lose my appetite. NEVER coming back.",

My sister in law then called the restaurant and requested to speak with a manager which was not available. We were then directed to the same rude blonde.

Never been disappointed yet and the price is even cheaper than Johnny Rockets. Biggest Rip-off: Guy Fieri's place. Wow, is this place expensive.....two burger, two beers, two orders of sweet potato fries $55 after tax and tip. And folks, let me tell you, Guy Fieri is a great guy to watch on t.v. but his burger is nothing special (the fries were very good though, again, $$$$). Ketchup falls somewhere in between. With a groupon offer this place is absolutely worth it, without a deep discount I'd skip the joint and, again, head over to Bobby Flays. This is my story and I'm sticking to it......that is until I find something better!",

I've read a couple of negative reviews, usually regarding price, but I think people forget they're in Vegas and eating on the Strip. If you don't want to spend money go to McDonalds! Tip - they have yummy poutine fries here!!!",

    "text": "Probably 3 1/2 stars, but I'm gonna round up for the three dollar 25oz Rolling Rocks. I've been here twice for some late night eats. Yes, I was less than sober each time, so maybe only drunk people should read my opinion of this place.   First time, I don't remember which burger I got, but it was good. After all, it's a burger. Even the ones that come in a paper bag that someone hands you through a hole in the side of a building are usually pretty good. On my burger scale, I'd probably rate it at the same level as like... Fatburger, only with more topping options and a bunch of different ketchup flavors.  The poutine fries were pretty good. When you're drunk, fries covered with gravy and cheese curds sounds awesome. Wasn't a huge let down, but ya know, it's a Canadian dish, and much like Canada, it sounds better than it is.  Second time, I got a crunch dog. I liked that too. It was like a Costco polish sausage with some Funyuns, bacon, and ketchup on it. That's not an insult. I like Costco hot dogs, but Costco hot dogs are a buck fifty and that includes a soda with a free refill. My crunch dog was about ten bucks I think. Maybe next time I go to Costco, I'll bring one home and make my own crunch dog.  I went to that other Cheeseburger place in the miracle mile a few years ago. That place sucked. If you're at Planet Hollywood and want a burger, go to Ketchup if you don't want to wait in the Gordon Ramsay line.",

I ordered the Big Bleu burger and the Poutine fries. The Poutine fries had gravy and cheese. It was enjoyable, but the fries could have been better. I feel like their unique sauces like the Sriracha ketchup helped to liven things up. Otherwise, the fries themselves were mediocre. The burger itself had a tasty bun and it was cooked to medium well. It was a bit overcooked in my opinion. And I usually enjoy medium rare, but it was still a good bite if you're hung over in Vegas and looking for somewhere you don't have to wait.",

Not to mention they wouldn't let my friend swap her soda for a shake even tho she had the money to pay the difference. I mean what is that about? Anyways I told the waitress about the missing shake and she looked lost. When she finally brought it she still didn't know where to put it. Thennn she tried to give us someone else's milkshake! Come on girl! Put those damn boobs away and pick up a book!   Now onto the food..my burger didn't have a lot of flavor except for the ham. Hell I couldn't even taste the actual burger patty. I also forgot that there was an egg because it had no flavor. That to me is just odd.. As for the shake all I could taste was the pretzel.   This place lacks in customer service and flavor!",

My husband and I stopped in to get a \"quick\" bite since we saw their Happy Hour sign and hardly anyone inside but the ordeal turned out to be 45 minutes for a freak'n corn dog!  It was not even that busy, approx 5 customers in the restaurant.  Bar staff greeted us and said he would be with us shortly. After waiting for 15 minutes at the bar and watching him help few customers and cleaning up, I walked up to bar staff and asked if we can place an order, again he said he would be with us shortly and tended to other customers. At that point my husband left and went to pick up pizza at Sbarro across the mall.   I stayed hoping to get better service by placing an order in  line with the cashier even if I had to forgo the happy hour menu since bar staff did not want to take my order.   The cashiers were not friendly as well and I waited for another 15 minutes on a corn dog. My husband was back with his pizza from walking across the mall while I was still waiting.   Food was ok but the service was not worth the wait.",

I ordered the BOGO Chicken Tenders (the Wednesday special) and fries. [BTW: Wednesday is spelled wrong on your sign] Prior to me receiving my food, the guys behind me got their food and went & then another person who ordered their food after me got their order and walked out. Finally my food came and the tenders and fries were average. Four tenders came with each one. I ate two tenders and saved the rest. The fries were average. I ate those because I don't like saving fries. I don't need to return ever.",

    "text": "S-L-O-W  I want to give this place higher than a 2-stars because the food wasn't bad but the service is awfully slow... someone help this one-man show working at the bar, please. It's not his fault, the place just wasn't adequately staffed. We placed our order at the bar. Everyone else working were cooks inside the kitchen, no one else tending the registers. Mind you, the place wasn't that full. We were supposed to grab a quick bite... it was nothing but. Maybe the slow service was just that day... hopefully it's not like that everyday!   When we finally got to the counter we still had to wait till we can actually place our order. We already knew what we wanted since we had to wait awhile. We had more than enough time to look at the menu over and over. We decided on a Mushroom Swiss and Fries. The burger was delicious, fresh and juicy! Lots of grilled mushrooms and caramelized onions on top of certified angus beef patty, melted Swiss cheese and mayo.   This burger joint is conveniently located inside the Miracle Mile Shops. As soon as you enter the mall from the parking garage structure it is immediately to your right. The prices are fair and they currently have a Groupon running which we used. The bar has 3 of 4 flat screen TV's. They have regular shakes and spiked ones too.  Review #0949",

The service was ok, but they were a bit slow even when not very busy. Luckily the food made up for it. They had tons of flavors of ketchup, which was fun to try.   The High Roller burger I got was so tasty and jeez it was huge! The bacon cheese fries just hit the spot but I suggest getting them to share!   I say hit this place up for a good bite to eat.",

    "text": "So I'm not the only one who received slow service here? Oh. Well I came here w/my fiancee on Sunday afternoon and it took almost 15 minutes to get 2 burgers and a large fry. It wasnt that busy either. Plenty of empty tables. But back to the burgers!  I ordered a Hot Mess which was a cheeseburger topped with a bunch of chili, jalapenos, and guacamole. It was a hot mess too! I needed a bunch of napkins lol The first bite was so full of flavor. All the ingredients come together nice in that 1st bite. But as the burger cooled down, I noticed the chili wasn't special. It was like regular ol' canned chili. Once my burger got too cool, I didnt even want the rest. It turned from a Hot Mess to a mess. But I blame my woman and I having a good time partly. I didn't just scarf down my mess of a burger.  My woman ordered a Western burger which is just a cheesburger w/an onion ring, 2 pieces of bacon, and hickory ketchup. And she liked almost every bite of her burger, but I ate the rest of her burger once my burger stopped satisfying my tastebuds! We both wondered why there were only two pieces of bacon on a $12 burger... But the Western was an awesome choice.  The KETCHUP was so good. I loved the flare to the chipotle ketchup. I'd go back there just to order a beer at the bar with a fry and that hickory ketchup. That hickory ketchup is the best ketchup I've ever had in my life! Is \"the best ketchup ever\" a thing?   The best thing about Ketchup is the ketchup, literally.",

I ask the lady at the counter exactly how much are these strips and how many come in an order. Come to find out bogo strips come with a total of eight strips for about 7 bucks! We decide to give it a try. While sitting at the bar awaiting our chicken the bartender comes over to check on us to see if we want drinks or anything which was nice. After about 5-10 mins our order was up. I open the box and wheeewweeee these are my kina strips! Huge chicken strips! Like we probably shared each one. If you like to drink a huge fat tuesday and get hungry while doing so stop here before getting your drink and walk around with your chicken strips lol. I know it sounds crazy but trust me you wont be disappointed. Im happy to drink my fat tuesday drink and walk around with a bag of chicken strips.

I can't really speak to the food but the spiked milkshakes are great and are why I go. They have a variety of amazingly delicious spiked milkshakes that will get your Vegas vacation off on a great foot. My personal favorites are the Strawberry Shortcake and the Dirty Pretzel.  Located inside The Miracle Mile, the vibe at Ketchup is very diner-esque. You order at the counter and have your food brought to you. You can also sit at the bar and order, which we generally do so we can order drinks. The staff is great - I've had great service every time I've dined there.",

The other ingredients were fresh, but this wasn't a quality burger as a whole. Poutine was alright but instead of using cheese curds they opted for cheaper slices of Swiss cheese which was a bit gross. You might pay a bit more elsewhere but I wouldn't waste a meal on this place if you're just visiting the area.",

The people I was with suggested to hit up Ketchup even though it might be up to par to Burgr.  So we walked that way to get there and ordered the High Roller burger made with Kobe beef. The burger and fries were pretty good and fresh. No complaints. Burgr is still better but decent alternative if you cant wait to eat at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr.",

    "text": "Surfing Groupon I found a deal for $10 for $20. I live in Vegas, have seen this hamburger place but have never tried it so my husband and I decided to give it a shot. The place is very nice and clean, more of a \"fast food\" type restaurant than sit down and and be waited on restaurant. There aren't any prices on their website so I was a bit surprised when I got there and it was $11.99 for a hamburger and an extra $4.99 for fries and a drink. Seems pretty standard for a burger place on the strip BUT most are worth the money.  The guy who took our order was very nice, gave us smaller menus to look at. Took our order and we paid. Had no problems using the Groupon. Now the Groupon said something to the extent of don't forget to tip at the FULL price, not the discounted price so we ended up paying $23 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks.  The thing that really annoyed me was they asked for a tip and then right after told us where the SELF SERVING STATION was. So I just gave someone a generous tip to basically take our order and bring it to us. We got our own drinks, own condiments, found our own seat, etc. I like to tip generously for SERVICE and this wasn't a service. I felt that was a little arrogant.  Onto the food. Meh is all I have to say. The fries were awesome, hot and crunchy. The burger was meh. Flavorless, dry and nothing special. I had the western burger which had very little sauce and my husband had the hot mess which he said was also flavorless and dry.  All and all, I probably wouldn't go back unless there was another Groupon and someone in town visiting really wanted to try it.  The music was also VERY loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation with my husband.",

    "text": "Good, but not great.  Ketchup is a burger place that is good, but potentially could be great. First time I went, I had the breakfast burger. Patty was good, not top shelf and for a bacon connoisseur like me, they certainly could've stepped up their bacon game. Overall good, but a little lacking.  I also recently discovered that they have a BOGO on hot dogs on Tuesday so I decided to give that a whirl one day. I had the crunch dog and the Vegas dog. The Vegas dog was basically a Costco hot dog with all the toppings, so good but  definitely not worth 7.50 but the crunch dog was a step up. It comes with bacon and onion crunch. As noted earlier, the bacon game needs to step up. This might sound weird but the onion crunch was too crunchy I don't know whether it's pre made or if the chef fries it but it was waaaay too crunchy. Less is more folks.  Two things this place has going for it: location is perfect. It's right by the parking garage when you enter so they'll always have foot traffic. It's actually why I even tried them in the first place: I was heading home and hungry so I decided to try them out.  The second thing they have going for them is their ketchup. I haven't even had the whole spectrum but I had the sriracha ketchup and the hickory ketchup and I loved them. That's something that I give them major props for that.  Where I think they can improve is customer service. The staff always gives the impression of basically sleepwalking anytime I go there, maybe i just have bad luck.  Another area of improvement would be to promote all the ketchup. Literally nobody that works there ever told me about them; I only discovered it accidentally when I wanted to get some ketchup for my friends fries. It would've been great to have been told about it, or possibly even given the option to have swapped out the regular ketchup for one of those on my hot dogs. It would've made a world of difference  Overall, I think its ok but I'm not really in any rush to go back",

The girls who take your order not welcoming (it's your job whether you like it or not the least you could do is welcome your customers with a smile), they delivered the wrong order to our table three times, saw at least three of the servers do this to other tables as well (know what your customers order especially when there is only a handful), this blond server had the worst attitude tossed our fried pickles and rolled her eyes when I stated, \"No, I ordered the ketchup classic\" I gave her no attitude not sure why she felt it necessary to roll her eyes and walk away instead of apologizing.  The attire worn by the servers was unacceptable. I would not allow it in my establishment. The server had on shorts that looked like old worn out pajama shorts that clearly showed she had nothing under. Hooters should be their attire standard just so they have some sort of guideline. Those girls tend to have the appropriate coverage and much neater shorts.    Enough about experience...  Food was bland. Buns, patty and fried pickles nothing special and not worth the $, although the ketchup was tasty I will not be returning. Fried pickles way better than the burger I'd give them a 6/10 still not enough to bring me back. Food looks great but the taste was overall disappointing.  Asked my friend who I was there with what she thought... She also was displeased.",

It's a burgers and dogs place, so not fine dining, but they did both the burger and the dog very well. The burger was cooked to order. Very juicy. The dog was also cooked well, not past its primes can happen with hot dogs. The quality overall was also good. The food didn't repeat on us later with indigestion. They have a selection of flavored specialty ketchups you can slather on your dog or burger including ... fry sauce!!

The menu selection is pretty large- for some reason their website doesn't have the latest version that has at least 10 specialty burgers, create your own and more. And the shake menu, ugh. Had I not been headed to an event at the Mandalay pool where there would be heavy alcohol, I would've loved me some milkshakes (boozy or not).  I had the Mac Attack burger (has Mac n cheese on it) with sweet potato fries. The services was quick and to my surprise, there is a long row of serve yourself ketchups. Not just any ketchup, but jalapeno ketchup, chipotle ketchup, fry sauce and many others. It was super exciting (how lame am I?). I guess that's where the name came from.  Anywho the burger was great (wouldn't say the best I've had), but the patty was very wide but not that thick. If it were thicker it would be even better but I loved how you got to pick how you wanted it cooked. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy, like they should be.   Overall I was very surprised by this place. Good food, great options and a full bar inside (separate from the ordering counter). It seems to have something for the whole family at a reasonable cost (for Vegas). I would go back here.",

Fresh and juicy real beef hamburgers made to order. They also have a ton of creative toppings. Something new to me was the slew on different flavored ketchup! I recommend the hickory or the garlic. They have hotdogs and my goodness the onions rings had the most delicious aroma flowing through the air! Why I also gave a 5 was truly the service. Fronz was awesome, kind, friendly and attentive. He even sung happy birthday to my sister and gave her a shot. Treating people special is what makes you come back when there are so many choices! Bottom line... I'd definitely return. Follow me at sweet_maloy on Instagram. Did I mention a full bar?? Of course, it's Vegas.",

As for the fries they were plentiful and I opted to dip the parmesan fries in their \"garlic ketchup\" which complimented it very well.

I wasn't even hungry.   My medium-well pickle/mustard/onion only burger was cooked perfectly. The bun was a little dense at first but that was soon appreciated as the big, juicy burger did not soak through the bun and cause a mess. I loved the burger. The pickle fries were a little disappointing. The breading could have been too much but I wouldn't take it that far. The pickle flavor was just ... lacking. I kept eating them, hoping for a little more, but they never came through.   I would eat here again and go with fries, they have a lot of ketchup options that I wanted to try but did not.

Food was very average no greater than McDonald's, but we paid $35.. for a burger, fries, chicken strips and two drinks (for $3.00 each) Although it was clean and associates were friendly, I wouldn't recommend this place. Save your money and get yourself something less average.",

Both nasty! $32 for a basic burger, blta, 1 order each of fries and pretzel bites, and 1 soda. The blta came dry (menu says it has mayo) and the girl was stingy with the mayo when asked for it, which took long enough for the toasted sandwich to be cold and crunchy. Never again! Keep walking, there's a number of fast food places on the strip where you can get cold mediocre food without horrible service and for way less $$$$.",

And I always find myself in the planet hollywood shops because I love shopping there. So it made sense to eat here during my shopping break.  I got my burger pretty quickly. And when I took a bite I was so dissatisfied.  The bun was super greasy and soggy. The meat was tasteless bland and soft and the tomatoes were smeared with ketchup.  No thanks.  I'll get Chipotle next time!",

We ended up sitting at the bar and the turn time was pretty good. I ordered the morning glory burger and it was really good. Good size and didn't even need fries to get full. Had a tall beer that was a great compliment.  The price was a little high for the burger alone, but the taste was very good. The lady at the bar was super friendly and attentive (like you would expect for a bartender wanting a tip) there were a ton of different ketchup sauces to use for your burger.. Very creative and tasty. So of you are looking for a quick not too busy place to get a bite to eat this place fit the bill pretty well.",

I'm a big fry person so I usually order the Philly cheesesteak fries as my meal.  I tried the poutine fries but it was a little too heavy for me, definitely loaded with gravy and cheese curds (my fault for ordering that as my meal and not expecting to feel full and bloated afterwards).  Not a fan of ketchup as a condiment but if you are this place has a variety of ketchups for you to choose.  Luckily for those like me they also have \"fry sauce\".  My loaded philly cheese steak fries already have a ton of toppings on it but I like having the option to dip into the fry sauce.  I usually eat here during my lunch break so never had a chance to order the spiked shakes, wouldn't mind trying this on one of my days off though.  Never had a burger or hot dog here but never disappointed with the fries here.  *they also have a high tech soda fountain with lots of soda flavor choices.",

WELL when we approached the bar and requested Happy Hour beer, the bartender said they do not do Happy Hour on Fridays. I mentioned the numerous signs stating differently, he signed new signs were being printed. I believe a company/business/restaurant should always honor what they market UNTIL a new marketing sign becomes available. We did not stay for beverage service and went to La Salsa Cantina that honored Happy Hour cheaper AND for another hour longer :)",

The additional mushrooms I ordered on it were borderline burnt. I happen to be a Burger Conneseur, so, for what it's worth, I would've done better going to In-n-Out. Also, their salted pretzel milk shake tasted good at first, but if you let it sit for a few minutes the pretzel bits turn soggy and tasted like wet bread. Blech! I could only drink half of it before it grossed me out. Otherwise, if you're drunk and later in the evening like most people are, you wouldn't care.   The service was practically non-existent other than them bringing the order to your table. I'm glad I didn't tip at the cashier because I would've regretted it. I tip for service so I refuse to tip someone standing at the counter doing their job. She gave me a scowl like she was expecting it.",

The cashier was a rude miserable cow who got mad at us for not mentioning that the orders were for carry out.  She didn't ask but I told her immediately after paying for mine.  I was first but still she didn't ask the other 3 people in my party when they placed their orders and assumed they were dine in (sigh). Stay in school.  When asked where we could find utensils, the same rude cashier pointed to a random spot across the dining hall and said \"over there\".  We had already looked here, there and everywhere but walked over ...there... and found no utensils.  I asked her again and replied that those were condiments. If I wanted utensils she had to pull them from under her counter or pull them out of her you-know-what perhaps.  It gets worse. We now had all of our food orders after 20 minutes but no shake. The milkshake I ordered... after reminding Ms Personality 3 times, was still no where to be found.  I really wanted my money back. After all, I paid $30 for a burger, small soda, tater tots and a milkshake.  My sis asked the bartender to make it and he tried to charge me for it again. That was another 20 minutes for the shake- I guess he had to milk the cow. The food was good except every one of us had a mistake in the order. We will never go to this place again. It blows and made a bad experience for all of us.",

Fortunately my faith was rescued by a caring manager and a lovely and talented bartender, so I have it another shot a couple months later. The second time around I was lucky enough to have Cheryl again as my bartender. I ordered the big bleu and was blown away by the improvement in quality. I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and the casual burger connoisseur.",

    "text": "I've been getting down at Ketchup regularly since I discovered it. Here you order and seat yourself until your food is delivered. I like that because I don't have to wait on a waitress to go back and forth from my drink to order and I don't have to get up to grab my food once I'm situated in my seat. They have a pretty good selection of burgers. They offer all sorts of substitution options including a vegetarian patty. Even with odd demands they've gotten them all correct so far so pat on the back to the cooks. I've tried a few different burgers so far and enjoyed them all. Their fries are pretty good too. They have those new touch screen soda fountains with more drink variants than I could mention but for starts all the classic soda, diet soda, and juice type drinks you could possibly need are available at the push of a button. I gotta say the cost to upgrade your burger, which does not include fries and drink, to a meal that does is a bit absurd. My will to eat there unfortunately cannot be supported by my ability to afford it as often as I'd like. I don't expect them to be inexpensive but for the price they are charging for these burgers I would hope fries on the side would be included. Between the food and the price the defining return factor is the customer service. I've been greeted by nothing but smiles and \"Welcome\"s by counter staff and the lovely lady at the bar. I say they're on the right track to staying in business but I hope they make some small changes to their menu prices.",

Ambiance is not great, so this is not the spot to come if you are looking for atmosphere. Both my daughter and husband are obsessed with ketchup and this place, with at least 6 different varieties of it, doesn't disappoint. My favs were the fry sauce and the garlic ketchup. Their parmesan garlic fries were very tasty. I had the Western burger, which is similar to the one you can get at Carl's Jr, but with a better brioche bun and higher quality meat. Daughter had the corn dog, which was good but pretty standard. Can't remember which burger husband got, but remember he was pleased with the quality. Prices are standard for Vegas ($12 burgers $6 fries). They had shakes and boozy alcoholic shakes but we avoided those (too much sugar!) This restaurant is close to the Saxe theater so if you are seeing a show there and want close, family friendly and affordable, try it out!",

Prices are ok given the area, service was super nice, no line, fast service and loved the ketchup bar with all the unique flavors. The poutine the worst I have ever had. Fries, gravy and cheddar, where are the cheese curds? And I am missing the meat, they were lackluster gravy fries, still good, just by now means poutine. Knowing that would be a meal in itself I went with a salad and added a veggie burger patty instead of getting the veggie burger itself. Descent size salad, pretty good veggie patty, thick and loaded with veggies, fried nicely, though comes in frozen, not made in house. The mac and cheese burger, huge and the best thing here. My husband had the hangover burger which he also enjoyed as well as the philly fries which were again not that great in quality. Not a fan of cheese sauce, these would have been much better with real cheddar. In all a descent meal for a better price than most other burger places in casinos, but no reason to come back.",

There were 2 guests ahead of me in line, but i noticed no one was taking their order.  After 8-10 mins, the guests in the front flagged down an employee only to be told with poor customer service to have the bar take the food orders.   After being redirected to the bar, the bartender then said the place was backed up and we had to wait at least 30 mins for our food. There were people at the bar drinking, but only some tables were occupied for dining.   Overall, it sucks that the employees were not giving their best efforts customer service wise because they were losing customers, and they had less work ahead of them.",

    "text": "Attention CCSD teachers: Ketchup Burgers is honoring teachers with choice of a free classic burger or hotdog! That extra star in my rating is for giving back to the educators in the community.   SERVICE: It's a walk-up and order joint with dining available at the bar. I guess the bartender isn't familiar with how to take food orders, because placing my order was much more complicated than it needed to be. He didn't know about the promotion, then didn't know how to ring it up, got frustrated and short with me until a manager came over to help out, then he never said another word to me. I don't know why I tipped him, his bad attitude made me feel guilty for inconveniencing him to serve me.  FOOD: Wanted a mushroom swiss burger, added mushrooms and garlic aioli, and switched out the cheese on the classic, and added a side of fried pickle spears, to make a purchase to offset the freebie.  Received a plain burger with swiss cheese, out three minutes after it was rung up and was room temperature.  Bartender brought it over and didn't even notice the missing ingredients. Went to counter to get assistance, manager stepped in again and had mushrooms brought out to me and comped the pickles. Burger was cooked well done, super dry. The garlic aioli was a smear the size of my thumb. Mushrooms had no flavor. Pickle spears were long and skinny like fries, and served sans any sort of dipping sauce, which I found odd. No flavor other than salty. Didn't finish burger or side. Mad that I wasted the calories on the poor quality I ate. Free or not, I've had better burgers from a drive-thru window.  TL;DR: It's pretty bad to have to complain about something that's already discounted. Staff other than management doesn't seem to care. Appreciated the manager helping out and trying to make things right- but he wouldn't have to comp anything if employees simply did their (very basic) jobs.  Oh, and considering I was seated at the bar, I was never given a beverage or even asked if I wanted one.",

The onion rings were a let down.  Too thick for my taste and slightly underdone.  The atmosphere is sports bar which was a great place to watch the NBA Finals.

The onion rings were huge, crunchy outside, hot and tender inside. The staff were very friendly and we got our food pretty fast. Overall I'd recommend Ketchup to burger loving tourists because it IS great food. The only bad thing I have to say about it is it's just too expensive for us to go to on a regular basis, and its location on the strip isn't very great for us either. We're local so for us it would be a pain to endure the strip just for dinner, but if you're there anyway and want good burgers and fries and have money to burn, definitely go there, you'll love the food.",

    "text": "The place is in the Miracle Mile Shops on the Strip. The theme is - you guessed it- ketchup. The T-shirts the staff wears all have a logo that's a parody of the Heinz keystone logo. You'd think they'd make that clear on the Groupon I used, or their Website, but they didn't, and the street address doesn't really cut it. I found the place after calling them and wandering around the Miracle Mile shopping center, using the directories to home in on it.  The place is not cheap, but they offer a variety of burgers with clever names, including the Big Blue, with bleu cheese, that I had, onion rings, fries of different varieties including Buffalo fries (fries with Buffalo wing sauce - aka Frank's Red Hot sauce), and the Philly cheese fries, which came with cheese and thinly-sliced steak, onions, and peppers. I got the Philly fries. You can also get shakes, but I thought that would be overkill with the already heart-attack-risking meal I was eating there.    The soda fountain is \"do it yourself,\" and they have pumps for ketchup, Buffalo wing sauce, and other sauces (BBQ, probably - I didn't look that closely). It's a little confusing, since the counter setup makes it look like customers shouldn't go there, and you should wait for an employee, but it quickly became clear to me that I was supposed to get my own drink (and I later saw a \"self service\" sign, and the employees all saw me getting my own drinks, etc.)..  I had a Groupon for $20 worth of food for $11 or $12, so the huge meal set me back about $7, including a $2-and-whatever-change tip, or $18 or $19, if you count the cost of the Groupon. The place would be a reasonably fair deal without the Groupon, but it's definitely better to look for a Groupon or other deal (Entertainment book, maybe?) before eating here.  The staff was friendly, and oh yeah, you can get \"dirty\" or \"wicked\" or whatever- they-called-them shakes with alcohol in them, and there's a full bar (No, that's not self-serve).  The alcoholic shakes all had clever names - the \"Dirty Sanchez\" on the menu stood out, since I was a little grossed out at the idea of something called that being in my mouth, not to mention the reference to a stupid young teenage boy myth/joke. But hey - it's Vegas - it's supposed to be \"edgy.\"",

I was further annoyed because we had a buy one, get one free coupon and my burger was supposed to be free (my husband got the high roller), they only took off 9.25 which would've been the cost of a beef burger without toppings. In the end, its like I paid full  price for 2 burgers. If you have a buy one get one coupon, just get 2 specialty burgers because building your own will not be worth it if they're not taking off the cost of each topping. Pretty dumb in my opinion. Good food, though!",

Everything is extremely overpriced and it's only a matter of time before peeps figure it out and avoid this fast food vixen.   Ordered a hot dog and a mushroom cheeseburger.  The hot dog arrived on a toasty bun with standard fixings including sauerkraut, onions, ketchup and relish. The hot dog was decent but as I was eating it, I thought of Costco and how I could get the same thing there which includes a coke. Here the regular price for a coke and the dog is $10.00 plus tax.    When the burger arrived it wasn't the right one and we had to send it back. The waitress was pleasant and got the right one out very quickly after the mistake.    The burger was very juicy and was actually quite good.  The burger had mushrooms and cheese on a lightly toasted bun.   Will I be back?  Probably not.  But we thought we would give this place a shot despite all the bad reviews.",

This cashier had ZERO personality and was not welcoming  As far as the burger- I've had better at Red Robin, it was NOTHING special. And for an angus patty - I would've preferred  to have it cooked to my desired temperature , not the medium to medium well it arrived.  The poutine fries was good- but not great. And the $7 shake ( for vanilla ice cream was nothing special at all The Burger Brasserie at Paris was significantly better all around",

What you get is the standard hot dog size with some fried onion chips and bacon, nothing else.  Fries and drink is not included, that's an extra $6-$7.   I ordered a large parmesan garlic fries, thinking the size was like McDonald's or BK's large fries, I was wrong!  that's like 3 X more fries! so $6 for a large premium fries at that mall location is Ok.  They have a few selection of ketchup; garlic, sriracha, mezquite, jalapeno, fry (I think it was a mix of ketchup and mayo).  The one I liked was garlic, the rest uh, uh.  Will I go again? probably not as there was nothing special for an over $9 hot dog!",

    "text": "The only thing premium about this place is the price they charge for their food.  I opted to go here to use a Groupon and because its location in the Miracle Mile Shops makes it an easy walk from the garage elevators to the restaurant for my wife.  I ordered two burgers--a mushroom and Swiss and a Western.  The mushroom and Swiss was supposed to be medium and the Western was to be rare.  With them, I ordered the soda/fries combo.  All that for a mere $36 including the $20 Groupon.  I went to the self serve area and got three flavors of ketchup.  I tried the balsamic ketchup, the maple bacon ketchup, and the fry sauce.  I also got our two iced teas and napkins.  The orders were brought and the mushroom Swiss was correct by burger was the wrong one so she took it back and eventually brought out a Western.  That's when my disappointment set it.  The burgers were larger and flatter than a hockey puck, but they were really lacking much flavor from the toppings.  They were also very, very dry.  I am a person who very rarely uses ketchup. I think it's a bastard food item meant to hide the taste of things on which it's spread.   When I put some on a burger, you know it's awfully dry and it needs something to make it taste better.  No luck.  It wasn't so dry, but the taste, oh it never was there.  The bacon on my Western was odd.  It was very tough although it had been cooked throughly.  There were a few things that made the experience tolerable.  I liked the women in their short shorts.  They looked quite fine.  The free wifi (well, I guess with the prices you should never refer to it as free wifi) worked well and was zippy.  Ask someone who works there for the password.  The wait for the burger was not long.  How did they overcook the meat that quickly to the point of desert dryness?  It's a puzzlement!  One more thing, the fries were good.  I realize I now have two rules for buying Groupons.  Rule #1:  Always check the Yelp reviews before buying.  Rule #2:  Don't forget Rule #1.  I guess I got to Rule #2 and didn't follow Rule #2.  Fool me once!  There are so many good burger places along the Strip, don't waste your time and money here.  It simply is not worth it.",

    "text": "Why oh why would one eat here when there are so many other amazing burger and hit dog places around The Strip? Oh yeah, we had a Groupon.  We skipped the burgers and got a chili cheese hot dog (with bacon added), poutine fries, and regular fries (so we could try all the different ketchups). The hot dog was alright. Nothing near as good as say Pink's (which is also located in Planet Hollywood). It was big and thick and loaded with all the toppings. The chili was meh. The poutine fries were edible, but far from even qualifying as good. The regular fries were just frankly icky. The variety of ketchups was great and the maple bacon ketchup and hickory ketchup were standouts.  It's located in the Miracle Mile Shops. If you park in the shops parking garage, this is one of the first places you will see when you enter the shops.  You order at the counter, receive a number, and then take a seat of your choosing.  There's also a small bar area if you want to get an over-priced beer ($7 for a Stella).  The counter staffer was incredibly less than pleasant. She looked like she had just rolled out of bed and would rather be anywhere but there.   We arrived just before the dinner time rush. And with just one staffer to place and bring out orders, we could see our order sitting in the window for way too long. We finally went and got it ourselves. Not cool.  And then a woman who I presume was a manager came out and started helping deliver the orders by yelling out the numbers instead of finding them. Not disruptive at all.  And the music was definitely way too loud.  And the food is definitely way over-priced for what you get.  So nope, we won't be dining here again.",

The service is like a cheap fast food joint but the prices are like for a steak house, $23.01 for a Swiss and mushroom Burger and tater tot with a draft beer. worth $12 tops.

We saw a guy unpacking hunts ketchup and the supply cabinet is out in the open and there was no Heinz to be found!!! Pretty odd to use the Heinz brand and not their product lol!!! So those fancy ketchups they have, are made with hunts not Heinz! For me, being from Pennsylvania, we Pennsylvania people know the difference of ketchup since Heinz is made in Pittsburgh, Pa. I just was disappointed that they advertise a brand but don't actually use it. What else are they fibbing about ? The burgers may not even be angus beef ahhhhhh!!!",

Review:  Food: I really wanted to try one of their burgers, especially one with an egg, but by the time we dropped by I was too full from a previous meal and just wanted to try the poutine. I was super excited because I don't know many places that serve poutine (although now it's becoming a popular dish). When we finally received our order (see SERVICE) I was sadly disappointed. The gravy was lukewarm and didn't have much flavor to it. There was also barely any cheese curds so the whole dish was pretty bland to me. I had to dip the fries in ketchup which really defeats the purpose of poutine.   Ambiance: Cute concept, down to the Heinz ketchup garbage cans. Diner like restaurant where you order at the counter before sitting down.   Service: We were greeted right away and we ordered before a huge line formed behind us. After ordering we killed time by stocking up on the different ketchups and I even looked through the options at the soda machine. 45 minutes later I was wondering what happened to our order. We ordered one item and although the kitchen was pretty backed up, it wasn't like they were cooking a burger or anything. Frustrated, we went back to the counter after we noticed that everyone else had already received their order. Apparently, they had lost our ticket. Big no no.   Tips: Overall it seemed just like your average burger place on the strip. Nothing really memorable except for the different types of ketchup.",

    "text": "This is probably a 3.5 star review due to the service, but I can't bump it all the way to 4.  We had just been at the Elite Event at Koi and were still hungry, so we decided to split a burger and some fries to finish the evening.  We split the Big Bleu, a burger with bacon, bleu cheese, and caramelized onions.  The bun was soft, but the patty was very overcooked.  No pink at all.  I pointed this out, noting that it was overcooked but it was fine, we'd eat it.  The bartender got us another burger without us asking for it.  She just had the kitchen wrap it up to take it home with us, which we appreciated.    We also split the poutine, the rich French fry dish topped with brown gravy and cheese curds.  The gravy was solid in taste, but a little thin.  Had some issues adhering to the fries.  Also, I could have used more cheese curds.  In other versions of this dish there is a lot more cheese.  That being said, the salty fries went great with the brown gravy and cheese.  I'd get this again.  Of the flavored ketchups, my favorites were the hickory and the balsamic.  You could bottle that balsamic and I'd gladly pay for it.  These were interesting additions, and frankly, it's something I'm surprised more places haven't tried.  Maybe I'm just going to the wrong places...  We sat at the bar, and the service was great.  Very friendly bartender and decent beer selection.  I think if they work out the cooking issues with the meat, this place can do well and is a solid addition to the mall at Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops and immediately accessible when arriving through the entrance from the parking garage. I bought a Groupon and ended up paying about $16 total for two people, so kuddos to the Ketchup Bar for letting me and the hubby enjoy an affordable dinner on the Strip. The Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is a casual burger fast food restaurant/sports bar. You walk right up to the front counter and place your order, then are handed a number and seat yourself.   The food took longer than expected, but we amused ourselves in the meantime by watching highlights of the recent Heats game. When the food arrived, we were all disappointed to learn that our burgers did not come with cheese. I ordered the Veggie Burger ($11.99) and my husband ordered the Ketchup Burger (8.99). For those prices, I think we were justified in assuming the burgers would come with cheese. I really liked my burger- it was crisp on the outside and appeared to be made of a medley of veggies, a refreshing change from the usual black bean or Boca burgers. My husband and the other couple we were with, however, were not impressed with their burgers. They complained that it lacked flavor and was dry. Everyone agreed that the fries were awesome, though. The interesting ketchup flavors, like siracha and balsamic, made the fries even better.   The customer service is minimal but agreeable. The only interaction you really have with employees is the cashier who takes your order. The cashier was super friendly. She waited patiently while I struggled to pull up my Groupon on my phone. When I told her the Internet service was being horrendously slow, she gave me the WiFi password and instantly fixed the problem.    I would come back for a veggie burger, but my favorable opinion of the Ketchup Bar was overruled by the 3 other people I was with. Unless you have the Groupon deal, the steep prices are hard to justify. The pricey burgers do not come with fries or a drink, but to be fair everything is overpriced on the Strip.",

I was sitting at the bar having a few drinks and burgers with my friend, enjoying the fact that the golden state won game 3 of the finals. The staff here was so friendly from the cashier, to the bartender i believe her name was martha. The food was really good and i would have rated this place a 5 star until i witnessed what i did. It was around 12:00am when i had finished my burger and fries when one of the employees was sitting at the bar (i think she was off now) and i believe this was either the owner or manager who came from the back accusing the employee of stealing. He was talking down to her and calling her a thief, now i have no idea what that was about and or if it is True but that was so unprofessional and for him to do that in front of customers, I don't understand who would think that is ok!!! Definitely left a horrible taste in my mouth, although I enjoyed the food, the friendly staff, and the location of this place, i wouldn't come back. NO EMPLOYER should treat their employees that way! If there is something going on you should pull your employees to the back and speak to them. Poor girl, i can only imagine the embarrassment she felt. I hope she quit, not everything is negative about the place. The food and drinks were good, my experience wasn't that great due to what I witnessed.",

As we stood there longer wondering where do we order, my husband calls me and says she's here. I walk over to the counter and the cashier (Gloria) is looking in another direction. I stood there and she says nothing so I say \"hello\", she said hi (dry) and I just started to order. She was not pleasant at all. Matter of fact she gave me the impression that we interrupted her from whatever she was doing. We sat down and when our food was ready, she delivered it and just started handing out food. The burgers were good and the ketchup bar had a variety of flavors however we could not enjoy our meal because of her nasty attitude. The first impression always sets the tone for the meal and she may need to call off if she's not in the best of moods or ask someone else to take orders. It wasn't just me because I asked other customers when they were getting ketchup. Gloria needs to go back to Customer Service 101 training.",

It's a make or break for me. This is where the the restaurant quickly lost two stars. The person who took my order wasn't very helpful, she didn't even smile, she seemed impatient, and she even said \" you should have ordered at the bar, but I'll help you.\" Being that myself, amongst many only vacationers who probably visit this restaurant ONCE to determine whether it's worth while or not, wouldn't know that so why not just help us and at least pretend you are there to help serve the customer.  -the bartender was very unaware of her surroundings. She looked at my tag that I needed a beer, said she'll be right with me, helped 2 customers, made only one of my two beers that were already paid for, and helped the next customer. It wasn't until 2 customers later that I said, \"sorry I need two....\" I shouldn't have to remind someone nor feel like it's up to me to make sure they do their job....  -food: the food was decent, they forgot my jalepenos on my chilli fries. The only positive to this was one of the ladies, blonde, who helped me, was extremely friendly and went out of her way to help me. Had it not been for her THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A TWO STAR RATING.",
