    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place...glad we tried it tonight. Ambiance was great and place looks clean.  We ordered the following items:  1) Dumplings (5 pcs) = It was pretty good. There are enough meat on each dumpling that made this good appetizer considering it's a little pricey for me. The sauce for the dumpling is quite good as well with a hint of ginger and sweetness to it.  2) Thai Tea = Hubby ordered it and he likes it. It was kinda weird that they give you syrup on the side as their thai tea doesn't come sweet to begin with. It was creamy and the tea flavor is not overwhelming.   3) Panang Tofu (Spiceness #1) = This was very good. It was creamy and the flavor was perfect. The tofu came out perfectly fried yet not hard...it was just right. This is definitely comparable to Archi's panang.  4) Panang Beef (Medium Spiceness) = My brother-in-law ordered this and he was quite happy.  He did say that their medium is more spicy that what he normally gets but he loves it nonetheless.   5) Beef Pad See Ew (Spiceness #1) = I was disappointed on this one unfortunately.  I really want to like it but it was bland and dry. It definitely could more sweet soy sauce. I just wouldn't get this in future.   6) Beef Fried Rice (Spiceness #1) = Hubby ordered this and he loves it. He would like to be a little bit more spicy but that did not disappoint him. He loves the flavor of it so he's a happy camper.  Overall, the food is good. They are pricey considering the portions are fairly small.  The service was good but there were only 3 table (including us). One thing we notice though, the table setting was incomplete. We already had our food and we only had napkins and knife on the table.  The server and busboy doesn't seem to communicate well as we haven't even gotten all our food and the busboy is already taking our plates to start clean up which I find odd. I also have to agree with the other review, it is freezing cold in there. The A/C was on full blast which was unnecessary at night I think but it was too cold to be comfortable.  The communication between staff and the cold A/C is where the 1 star deduction came from. We would definitely be back to try the other foods in the menu.",

    "text": "Okay here we go on this review. The Green Curry made in Medium was awesome and GREAT tasting. The only thing is the menu reads Fresh bird eye chili paste, bamboo shoots, basil, coconut milk and a choice of your meat chicken beef or pork.  When I got home as I ordered this to go. The container had Zucchini with red and green bell peppers which was not stated. Good thing I am not allergic to those vegetables as they should disclosed this on there discription in there menu.  Green Curry was yummy. I don't know if you eat in they give you a better portion size because the container was just enough for one person and I don't eat much. I will go back and eat in the next time and try the green curry again to see if the consistantcy of quality is just as good when I just had it.  I will try to give other menu items a try to and will see if other  friends would like to try this place with me as a sit down meal.  From going in the Restruant the ambiance was very inviting and clean and nice and bright color decor.  Restruant looks well kept and clean and nice table room not cluttered and close to the next person.  Friendly staff was very welcoming!",

The delivery driver was a very nice young man, and arrived way before the quoted time.  The food is pretty tasty but really only 2 shrimp in the Mango salad w shrimp?  The volcano chicken was great.

The decor of modern Asian minimalism in soft lemongrass and wood tones is very warm and inviting.  We were greeted and seated immediately by one of the friendly and attentive waitstaff.  I felt a disconnect almost immediately after being seated.  The large flatscreen televisions, the R&B music complete with expletives, and the noise coming from the back of the house were confusing and distracting for me.  Maybe this is what the market dictates in this area?  I ordered a glass of house Chardonnay and decided to get over it. It was delicious.   We ordered the Tom Kah and Mongolian Beef, both with medium spice.  Both were very good, and worth ordering again in my opinion.  Again, the waitstaff were all friendly and attentive.  I would probably not go back into the restaurant again, but I would definitely order take out from them.",

Pad Kee Mao with chicken was excellent and just the spice level requested, as was the Szechuan Chicken.  The Mango Rice for desert was incredibly beautiful in presentation, but the rice itself was not as tasty as it looked, but it was still very good.  Got another Tom Kah soup to go since it was perfect as an appetizer, main course, dessert or whatever.  So very good.  Will go back for sure.  Atmosphere was very pleasant and soothing but stil casual. Only real complaint from me is the temperature.  Air conditioning was way too cold for evening, and just when I thought I was way too cold to take it any more, it kicked on again full blast.  Doesn't let hot food stay hot for long.  Will wear pants and a jacket next time just to stay comfy.",

    "text": "The last time I dined at Gaati was around June in 2013, though I'm eager to return when I get the chance. At the time I ordered a chicken pad siew and a Thai tea. It was my first time trying Thai tea and I found it to be very creamy and sweet. Not necessarily something I'd order with dinner but it certainly didn't detract from the meal.  I had ordered the pad siew mild, but the waitress seemed to have misheard me and said she would get me a medium. I figured the difference would be minor enough that I didn't mind the mishearing but the food at Gaati definitely runs hot. My tongue was already a bit sensitive from some sour candies I'd eaten earlier that day and I ended up in tears as I ate my meal. It was so exceptionally delicious that I didn't care that it was far spicier than expected- I did choose to eat at a Thai restaurant, after all. I ended up overwhelmed and took home plenty of tasty left-overs (eaten cold in hope it would be easier to get through). Despite the difficulty, I'd happily order the pad siew medium again.  The decor was tasteful with dim lighting. I ate there with family but it looks like it'd be perfect for a date night. I definitely recommend this place for Thai food lovers.",

The service was excellent! I liked how they timed our food nicely instead of some restaurants that just bring out the food as its ready.  We started with the chicken curry puffs and those were excellent. I never thought I would enjoy curry in a puff pastry but it was very crispy, flavorful and not oily. The cucumber relish went very well with the puffs. Then, we had the papaya salad which was good. For our entrees, we had Panang curry with beef, Pad See Ew and Crispy Pork Belly with Chinese broccoli. The curry was amazing and the beef was very tender. Definitely something I will order again and again. The crispy pork belly was also very tasty and will order this again too. I wasn't a fan of the Pad See Ew, but I'm not much of a fan or Thai noodle dishes.  You must try their coconut ice cream with bits of jackfruit! It was amazing! I'm drooling just thinking about it as I write this review.",

I had high hopes since this place had decent reviews.  Prices were a little more than I usually pay, but I figure if it's good than it doesn't matter.  I ordered a number 7 spice, it was so bland I had to add my own salt and chili sauce at home.  I ordered extra bean sprouts and was charged $2 which is overly priced and have never been charged extra at any time restaurant I been to. I didn't think much of it until I got home and there wasn't extra at all!   The curry puff was still frozen inside so it's obviously was not made fresh. The soup was okay, but also on the bland side.  I'm disappointed in this visit. So sad because the decor and service was great hence the 2 stars.",

Called Grubhub and restaurant simultaneously and both put us on hold to get their stories straight; the \"manager\" shows up with the food while on hold (shocker), restaurant says they called me five times, manager shows up with wrong number called twice AFTER both of my calls, and more lip service... now I have no dinner and need to wait five business days for a refund... shame on you. Lie about using grubhub, then use your own employees to upcharge, then don't show up. Male answering the phone told me \"I'm busy right now,\" and didn't want to be bothered with our calls... wonderful. We have hungry kids. Thanks a lot. Steer clear unless you want to pick your own food up. These people are dishonest and now I wait more than a week for my refund. Shame on you guys.",

When we order for pick up, the food is always hot and the staff there, no matter how busy they get, always are friendly and check us out quickly. I get the Pad See Ew with tofu (are at vegetarian option, which they have many of!) So, I already had high expectations while dining in today. I was not disappointed at all. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our appetizers and favorite to-go meals were great sizes, hot, and as tasty as always. Tip: They have a spice rate system that goes 1-4, if you like spicy, a 3 is very good. Our waters were refilled multiple times without having to ask. The team at Gaati is all around great. Also, Gaati has a nice, calm, homey atmosphere with two TVs in the corners of the restaurant and low music playing in the background. Can't wait to come back!",

I drove over and walked inside, it was a really cute restaurant, good ambiance that would be perfect for a date night. When I walked in no staff was up front, so I stood there for a few minutes before finally someone peeked out of the kitchen and called for one of the servers. The food was delicious. They gave a good amount of food for the price and I will definitely be getting curry here again! The only thing I didn't like was the cubes of tofu. They were cut so big it was awkward to eat!

What really captured me was the food.  My friends and I ordered the curry puffs as appetizers to start which were good. We then shared a bowl of crab fried rice and pad see ew.   I'm a huge fan of Thai food and love love love Pad Thai and Pad See Ew dishes. However, I find that most places don't satisfy my Pad See Ew cravings. The Pad See Ew at Gaati was delicious -- the noodles tasted fresh and smooth, not chunky and gross as in other places. The taste was just right... not too salty, not too spicy, not too yeck. The beef was cooked just perfect as well. The beef was not chewy like gum nor was it disgusting and tasted like fake meat. really enjoyed the Pad See Ew w/ beef.  The crab fried rice was average to me. The crab did taste pretty good and, unlike some other places, had a pretty distinct part of the dish (some other places you can barely tell there is crab in your crab fried rice).  I would come here again for the Pad See Ew alone!  My only complaint is the pricing is a little high compared to most Thai restaurants I've been to, especially being that this is more on the casual side despite the slightly upscale ambience.",

She looked at the plate it was served in with a questioning look and said \"..but you ate almost all of it\" ignoring the salad on our own plates. She took it away then came back and   added with attitude that the chef doesn't think it's too salty.

    "text": "It was another Sunday where I barely felt like moving off of my bed let alone going somewhere to pick up some food (making it about the 30th Sunday so far this year).  Didn't really feel like pizza and around these parts if you don't want pizza the options are limited.  Decided to try Gaati for the first time even though it required me to pick up the phone and dial a number which was a struggle in itself.  Took me about 10 minutes it felt like to explain my street address because it contains roughly 12 words in it which is another issue altogether, but the food was on it's way and showed up 45 minutes later as promised.  I really wished I liked it more, but ultimately I found it fairly run of the mill thai food.  I tried the Basil Fried Rice with Tofu because fried rice always sounds delicious, the pictures on this site looked good, and I chose Tofu because I wanted to limit my weight gain over the weekend to a respectable 9.75 lbs instead of 10.  I ordered it a spice level 3 out of 4, which is a pet peeve of mine to not offer more variety of spice levels.  I found this dish to be pretty bland and underseasoned, and it didn't seem spicy to me in the least.  Another minus for me which would probably be a plus to any reasonable human being was that it wasn't greasy at all.  It almost seemed healthy in a sense but on this night I would have preferred a little bit more oil to it for some more flavor.  I ordered the tofu to make me feel less guilty about the grease that would be dribbling down my chin while eating it and didn't get that.  2/5 because it wasn't inedible  I also tried the Pork Mee Kao which I saw someone mention was drunken noodles in one of the reviews here.  I've had drunken noodles at Lotus which I consider to be one of the top 78 things I've ever eaten so I figured I'd give them a go here, also a 3/4 spice level.   As not spicy as the Fried Rice was, this was the complete opposite and was burning my entire mouth with every bite and I literally still felt the pure heat in my mouth hours later as I reveled in the new Breaking Bad episode.  Even though it was spicier than I would have wanted when ordering a 3/4, it was still a very tasty dish and the pork and veggies seemed fresh and of good quality.   It was nowhere near as good as the Lotus of Siam version (if they are indeed the same thing), but I would eat it again for sure (next time a 2/4, which will probably not have any spice whatsoever.   see why I hate this scale?)  4/5 on this one  Both of these dishes were $11 and I ordered an iced tea which was probably $3 or so, and my total when delivered was $30.50 which was a little more than I expected.   To be fair their menu says it's a delivery surcharge based on distance up to $7 and it looks like I probably paid $4-$5 which isn't too bad, but you might want to check with them when you call in to double check as I was left with only $3.50 to tip the delivery driver in cash instead of my standard $5.   Not surprisingly I thought the noodles was worth the price and the fried rice not.     So yeah, after all that, 3/5 and you're probably no better off than when you clicked this.  You're welcome.",

    "text": "First time trying Gaati, was highly recommended by both my friend and by another friend of my wifes. We ordered pad thai, yellow curry, and stuffed chicken wing. Yellow curry was ok but super light in the chicken and loaded with undercooked potatoes and carrots. Pad thai was pretty bad, lacked flavors, lacked peanuts, no limes, and no sauces, but worst of all seemed very old like leftovers, was one gelatonous cubular mass in the container solid as a whole yet composed of very mushy noodles. I had to cut it like lasagna to plate for my family. Stuffed chicken wings were ok, Ive had better at siri thai for much less, and siri thai isnt exactly the standard of excellence for thai in henderson either, readers may remember siri was famously caught last year by the health dept recycling rice off of bussed dirty dishes from the dining room. I would go 2 stars but pad thai is the one dish that better be good at a thai place, and their prices are just as high as pin kaew at no where near the quality. Too bad pin kaew is scary with old half rotten seafood as well, the search for decent thai in henderson goes on.",

But Gaati is a wonderfully clean, comfortable, and friendly restaurant with great Thai food. The Pad Thai is fantastic with fresh, not dried, rice noodles, with moist, tender chicken and served in an abundant amount. The Gaati dumplings are homemade with lots of filling and a great dipping sauce.  Didn't have dessert because we were too full! We had been to Gaati a month prior and it was just as delightful then.  After having a very not-to-good experience at Pin Kow, we were anxious to go back to Gaati for truly good Thai food!",

However, the younger guy who seemed to be an assistant waiter is still there, and now appears to be the lead waiter.  Thankfully, the food is still very good.  They's had a few minor tweaks to the menu, but most of the favorites are still there.  My only criticism is that, IMO, they've ruined the ambiance of their tasteful dining room by installing two large TV monitors in corners of the room.",

Omg the green curry was flavorless and the consistency of water. The tom yum soup was bland and too sour. I also ordered chicken satay, bad idea, how can you mess up chicken satay? The peanut sauce was terrible. I also ordered the pumpkin custard, nasty.... It doesnt take like pumpkin at all and over cooked. The only thing that was good was the young coconut because they didn't touch it. Everything I ordered was really small, it only took a few minutes to eat. $52!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What the F!!!   So expensive! I could of heated a bowl of water in the microwave and ate that for dinner, it be a lot cheaper and would somehow tasted better. Don't waste your money. Go to sakun or Thai house were they know how to cook Thai food!",

I had the rama chicken (grilled chicken and spinach with peanut sauce) during our first visit and it was very tasty, though I might see if it's possible to add a little spice another time. My husband loved his massaman curry! During our second visit, the food was about a level spicier than we were expecting, but still delectable! I ordered beef pad see ew which is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the jungle curry which is a bit more soup like and he really enjoyed it too! On another note, sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but the food is well worth the visit! We love this place and will definitely be back!",

Selection of food choices are a bit different from other thai places; there seems to be chinese style dishes mixed with thai dishes and this meant there were fewer choices for thai ones.  I had the pork belly with chinese broccoli (with jasmin rice) and it was quite tasty.  Not overcooked or too over-spiced. Overall the experience was good; service was good and it wasnt crowded at all for a saturday night.   Prices are slightly higher than other thai places in the area and the food was not exactly better so I'll just stick with my current fav siri thai.",

I wanted to try Gaati, as we live in the area and it's relatively new. We were thrilled with this new addition to our neighborhood! The atmosphere was modern and very pleasing to the eye. The service was absolutely outstanding. Our server spent time talking to us, and was extremely friendly. The manager also came out to talk with us. This is a family-owned restaurant, and the owners and staff made us feel very comfortable.  We ordered Treasure Bags for an appetizer, and not only was the presentation impressive, the food itself was delicious. For a main course, we ordered Panang curry and Pad Thai. I've been searching for this particular taste of Pad Thai for many years, and I finally found it again here at Gaati. The food was absolutely delicious, a feast for the senses.   With a combination of delicious food and fantastic customer service, we'll certainly be visiting Gaati Thai Kitchen again very soon!",

Perhaps we are spoiled by being from Seattle, where some of the best Thai food in the country is available.   Anyways, to continue this short review of Gaati . . .   We always start our test of a new Thai restaurant by ordering two dishes:  Tom Kah Gai and Chicken Pad Thai.  Here, the Chicken Pad Thai was greasy, burnt, oily and salty..    The Tom Kah Gai was awful.  They used milk or cream in it, which does not belong in this dish normally made with coconut milk.  Not only did it have milk or cream in it, but it  had actually curdled!. It was nauseating.  We suspect the cook had some semantic confusion between the word \"milk\" in coconut milk and actual milk.    We didn't finish the food and never went back.  We were very disappointed.",

What stood out were the bbq spare ribs which were fall off the bone outstandingly delicious!!  Not to be missed when ordering from here.  In fact, get two.  The 3 different noodle dishes all basically looked and tasted the same.  I could only tell the difference because of the proteins and one had broccoli in it.  Otherwise, all very similar.  There was nothing necessarily wrong with our meal, but there was no wow factor either.  Just very average.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again.  Not when there is fabulous Thai food in delivery distance from us that always hits the mark.  Sorry, but there is too much competish is this town for mediocre.  Step up your game!

It's the perfect thing on a cold winter. Ambiance is great and intimate. Place looks extremely clean and tasteful. I've now moved on to my pad see ew. Serving is pretty standard with other Thai places. Everything is well balanced. Chinese broccoli is tender and the noodles have a nice bite. Price is reasonable. Paid 8 for the great Tom Kha. 11 or the pad see ew. This is near seven hills so I'm not surprised with the mark up and the food is great. Service is pretty good as well, they don't keep bothering you about how everything is going. Your water is always filled. Btw spice levels on the food are exactly as you ask them. You ask for medium spice and that's what you get. Not like other places where you ask for 4 and it tastes like an 8.",

He asked how spicy I wanted it.I said a 7, he said they only had 1 thru 4, I said 3. My order was to go.The food was very bland and no spice at all.I was very dissapointed. Later my stomach became upset and I spent my evening on the toilet. I know it was this food as it was the only thing I ate that day.  Very upset and dissapointed.

    "text": "Like a few others before me mentioned I should have taken a look at the reviews before visiting.  I ordered Thai beef jerky $10.00) as an appetizer and to their recognition it was tender, tasty and seemed like it was a high quality meat, however this would be the only good experience with their food that day.    We dined around 2:30 so they still had their lunch specials running, my girlfriend and I both ordered the Mongolian beef ($9.99) which came with a soup and house salad.  I also ordered Thai house fried rice $11.00 + $4.00 if you want to add a meat).  They have a spice level of 1-4,  I ordered at 3 and she at a 2.  The salad would be as you expected however the dressing was extremely sweet, almost to a point that when eating the Thai jerky it changed its flavor profile and not in a good way.  The soup was a cream based soup and very bland.  When the main meal arrived I was shocked at how absolutely small the portions were.  I wasn't expected a main meal portion do to it being a lunch special however the portion of rice I would equate to an ice cream scoop and the beef contained less that a cup and was lodes high with rice noodles.  The food was bland at the very least and what flavor it did have was so sweet I took one bite and had the waiter return it.  I figured I would be content with the fried rice when it arrived but it had less flavor then the beef and consistency was more like uncle bens rice.  The waiter was professional and did take these items off the bill, but it was clear with one bite from each dish it was not enjoyed and he didn't ask for feedback but I certainly gave it.  The only thing I didn't add is the decor was nice but seemed very Americanized and the prices at this place are not on par with the quality.  Their prices seem more fine dining when it should be more like a fast food China a go go.  I have no plans on returning however if you do choose to go here I suggest ordering at a spicy level 4 and going before 3 and take advantage of the lunch special.",

There was good and bad reviews but it was the closest location so I figured what the heck and gave it a try.  I have to say this is the BEST Thai food that I have ever eaten!!!  Everything was excellent, the service, the ambiance and especially the FOOD.  I like my food with a little heat but not too much.  The food was served just the way I wanted and the flavors were amazing.  I had the Spicy Grilled Beef Salad and Szechuan Chicken.  On both items the meats were prepared perfectly!  Another nice surprise I had was meeting the head chief.  She came out and introduced herself to the people eating.  I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas next month to eat there again.  I don't know about other Thai restaurants in Vegas but from the experience I had, Gaati Thai will surely get my return business.",

We had the curry puffs, dumplings(sauce is divine) and Tom Yum Koong to share as starters.  I always order a 10 on the spice scale and today I broke a sweat- it was perfect!  My girlfriend on the other hand can't handle the heat so I recommended a 3, but she went for a 5. She loved it.  My friends are curry lovers so they tried the yellow curry and the red curry lunch specials and there wasn't anything left on their plates.  My favorite is the Thai Chicken Salad - I've been craving it since my last visit last week. Just  thinking about it makes my mouth water. YUM. But to top it off we shared an authentic Thai dessert so they brought us out the Pumpkin Custard.  I've never tasted anything like it.  It was sweet (but not too sweet), warm and oh soooo delicious. I tried just to eat a small bite but couldn't help eating my whole portion.",

It's closer than our go to place, Pinkaow so we were happy to see a new Thai place in our area.  My husband had his favorite Spicy Chicken Mint and I had Pad Kee Mao with tofu. The noodles were good but the chicken dish had way too much sliced onion and the spice level was way off. I'm not exaggerating when i say about half of the dish was sliced onion. My husband has a pretty high tolerance for spice but went with their \"medium\" spicy. To test out our first order. It was way hotter than it should have been. He normally gets the \"Thai Spicy\" from Pinkaow, which is just above their 10 level but said Gaatis medium was just as hot if not hotter. For a medium spice level, it was way too hot. The prices are slightly higher than Pinkaow but you get less food.  I figure maybe we need to give them a second shot and order other dishes but based on our first experience, it would be hard to go back when we know what we are going to get from our other reliable go to Thai restaurant.",

Dim lights, lovely table settings, and very hospitable staff.  Moving onto the food - it was amazing. We ordered the Shrimp Tom Yum hot pot, but vegetarian style, and Pad Thai, both medium spiciness. I, myself, am a bit wary of any level of spiciness as I've had many bad experiences with that with the chefs being a bit heavy-handed with the spice with anything \"mild\" and on. However, these two dishes might make me re-think that and become more adventurous. Both were perfect with their spicy flavor. The hot pot was light and hearty and the serving size for 2 people was more than enough.  (Yay for leftovers!). The Pad Thai was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy with the noodles being al dente. Upon hearing me telling that my mom has been trying to make Pad Thai and has come close to having an amazing dish but it still feels like it's missing something, the waitress informed me that that was probably because the noodles that were used were the stuff that needed to be soaked in water. This restaurants Pad Thai was homemade. My boyfriend, being the world traveler that he is, told the waitress that this was the best Pad Thai since he's travels outside of Bangkok. For dessert, they gave us complimentary Thai ice cream - also homemade!  The price of the dishes were decent for the serving sizes.   Before this thai food experience, I enjoyed Thai food but wasn't a fan. I can now say that I am a fan of Thai food.",

I've been burned before, so I've increasingly asked for hotter every time thereafter); maybe it's because I'm  a white guy. Aside from the level of spice/heat; everything has been of excellent quality, served very promptly (so food is hot in temperature and still crispy); between dishes I've ordered, as well as, the rest of my family, I've tried just about everything on the menu. Price is decent, not a bargain nor a rip off. Overall, I  recommend Gaati Thai Kitchen, just be aware that they base their level of spice on the average Anthem retiree.",

Our friends had the panang with beef (recommended by one of the owners) we all tried it and loved it. They also enjoyed some pad Thai.

I would go back JUST for more spring rolls!   The waitstaff was extremely attentive, my water glass wasn't even 1/4 way down from the top and they rushed right over to refill it. When I asked the rest to be put in to-go containers, they made sure to provide us with extra rice to take home with us also.   VERY good, I'll definitely be back.

Definitely has a romantic setting if you're trying to go on a date. Server was very kind and knowledgeable with everything on the menu. I ordered the pineapple fried rice and it was certainly an enjoyable dish with fried rice tucked into a fresh pineapple with shrimp and chicken. I'm usually not a fan of pineapple fried rice but it was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend ordered the choo Chee salmon which had a kick of spiciness to it but indeed it was delicious as well. It also had eggplant which I thought complemented the salmon perfectly. I wish I had room to try the mango sticky rice which seeing other pictures on yelp looked really good but it definitely gives me a reason to come back!",

    "text": "What happened to you Gaati!?! Every time we ordered from you it is usually  a hit. A few times it was not consistent. This time is the last straw... We ordered delivery of $50 of the chicken pad Thai, broccoli with fried pork, tofu paw see wheewwwwww and mango sticky rice. With a side order of the vinegar green chili.   Once we got our order to the door, both noodle dishes lacked favor. We barely even see the meat/tofu. And they said the side order of chili was rotten so they didn't put that in. It's one of the best part to put in the noodles if you want a tangy hot kick to the dish. And to top it off... the mango dessert looks like they give us half of a rotten mango WITHOUT the coconut sauce. WTF. This order was not worth over $50 for shitty food.   You guys lost a customer.",

The peanut sauce for the satays was very runny and the pad Thai noodles were completely overlooked and greasy (also very little chicken or bean sprouts or peanuts to be found in this Pad Thai). For their prices and where they're located, the food needs to be improved in a big way.   If I want amazing Pad Thai I will need to go to Archi's or at the least, Pin Kaow. The first time we were here, the old owner made the food incredibly well and it was worth the price we paid. But now, it's just not very good.",

    "text": "It's no secret I eat Thai food every chance I get. That's what happens when you are raised on bland casseroles and french bread pizzas. Gaati proved to me that even Thai food can be quite bland.  Let's start with the good. The three stars are for the Pad Kee Mao and the BBQ Chicken. I salute you for these dishes. The noodles were not oily at all and the spice was spot on. The BBQ Chicken rocked my world even after I removed the skin it still had such intense flavor.  The chicken even looks bangin'.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fknU3sWplCBn26b6HwJ1kQ?select=97JwL9i1u5RdcY0oB6DUog#TtsrNGujlDzYETlZ6SyByg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fknU...</a>  Now for the bad and the ugly.   1. UNINVITED GUEST: We saw two spiders crawling on the table. One on a plate and the other just pimp walking across the table. I hate to put a beautiful restaurant such as Gaati on blast, but HELL NO I don't want spiders skinny dipping in my food. Even if it is extra protein. How do you say no bueno in Thai? Now add the eff word and that's what I'm sayin'.  2. BELOW TO AVERAGE DISHES:  Back to the food. I also sampled the Green Curry which had zero flavor and runny sauce. The Pad Thai and Tom Kha were mediocre and the Red Curry had too much going on at once. The spices seemed to be playing Fight Club in my mouth. Yeah, yeah. I know, I'm not suppose to talk about Fight Club. Bite me.  3. PRICES: Gaati is overpriced. If the food made me fall in love I wouldn't be complaining. But, it didn't. Add the spiders to the mix and I think the shit should be free.   Plain and simple I will not be returning.  Just because the restaurant is visually attractive and the service was average doesn't mean the food is going to completely stimulate my taste buds. Especially when there are bugs involved.    In a dance off Gaati Thai doesn't stand a chance against other Thai restaurants in town. It can't even hear the beat and it might only have one leg with a webbed foot and a throbbing bunion. It can't stand on that leg, period.  APPROVAL DENIED.",

The pan-seared dumplings were quite good--they were a bit greasy and were stuck together and fell apart when I gently tried to separate them, but they were flavorful and yummy! BBQ chicken entree was nicely seasoned, subtle and nice. Dinged 1 star due to dumplings sticking together and falling apart when separated, and that I found a pebble in the rice or chicken. But 7 stars for the crab rangoon, and overall elevation of the whole experience way beyond what you usually find in Henderson NV.",

I loved it.    I dont really remembered what I ordered I think it was pineapple chicken. And once they were putting it down on our table. WHOA the aroma of it was crazy.

    "text": "This place has a great ambiance, totally appropriate for intimate gathering. Service was relatively prompt. We had the chicken pad Thai, beef green curry, and a scoop of the coconut ice cream. When we received the dishes I noticed immediately that the portion sizes were a little on the small side; I could probably count the bamboo shoots in the curry on 2 hands, and the rice came in the same size dish I used to serve butter in when I worked at a restaurant back in the day. It was easy to overlook a bit because the flavors on the noodles were definitely there, the green curry was good (not great), and the ice cream had good flavor even if the consistency had a lot to be desired. We ordered the entrees at a level-2 (of 4) in spice and I typically add more chili powder once it's on my plate but I was surprised when it had a nice little kick to it. If you're sensitive to spice, get the chili on the side. Overall, if it wasn't for the nice ambiance and the service this would for sure be a 3-Star review.   PROS: Pad Thai (chicken) had good flavor.  Menu featured duck.  Ambiance is nice.  Service was prompt.   CONS: Beef in our green curry was kind of tough.  No pork on the menu, whaaaa?! Coconut ice cream was especially icy. Where's the rest of my food? (Portion size, even on the side of rice were less than generous)",

    "text": "This is my first Thai restaurant since I've relocated from LA. We started with Chicken Satay as our appertzer. I found it to be very tender. My daughter did not care for the peanut sauce. For my main entree I ordered traditional Pad Thai with shrimp. I found the rice noodles very petite and tight. The shrimp was surprisingly larger than I expected. My daughter ordered Crab fried rice. She found it to be fishy with a heavy egg taste. She was not expecting a heavy egg taste. It distracted from the blended flavors. My husband ordered the Pineapple Chicken.  He loved the taste, but he felt it could have had  more bellpeppers and onions. We also tried the Thai tea. I thought it was great. My daughter thought too much cream. Dad order a Coke he was happy. Would we come back.....probably not. Would I recommend...no. The service was great and the first impress was nice.",

Kayba greeted us as soon as walked in. We told her it was our first time there so she gave us two menus to look at the lunch specials. She answered several questions for us and explained the dishes.   The lunch special is $9 which includes salad with ginger dressing, tom yum soup, a curry puff and main course. You can choose from beef, chicken, vegetable or tofu and then what type of entree you want. There were many options: Pad thai, mongolian, sweet & sour, panang, green curry, yellow and red curry.   We chose the chicken pad thai and chicken yellow curry. Kayba brought out our salad and soup which I thought were very good. The salad was a little sparse with just some lettuce and carrots but the ginger dressing was great.   Shortly after our entrees arrived. I am not a Thai food expert but I really enjoyed my pad thai, the sauce was delicious. Kayba came by to make sure we liked everything and to refill our drinks. She was very friendly and helpful to first timers.   I thought the food and service were great, and for $9 we were full and happy.",

    "text": "Joined a couple coworkers here after work so didn't get a chance to check Yelp beforehand. My general impression was that quality control is iffy and I think the variance in reviews on here (esp. from fellow Elites) may confirm that.  We had the chicken satay, curry puffs, pad kee mao with shrimp, spicy basil chicken, green curry salmon, and taramind crispy duck. The meats were high quality (esp. the salmon and shrimp) and the meat itself was prepared well. The reason I say \"meat itself\" is that the crispy duck was breaded with a tough, distinct layer - basically sweet and sour pork style (literally like how Panda Express did it... at least back when they still had pork), which was just awful. It was a lot better after scraping the breading off, but then it wasn't crispy duck anymore.  The vegetables were also totally overcooked in everything except the spicy basil - literally, completely mushy. And everything here was on the super sweet side, to the point that many of our dishes were coming across our taste buds very similarly.  Also, their spiciness scale is from 1-4 and we got 3 on everything and it was what I would call mild. Would definitely go straight for 4 if I go back.  The service did not help. Our waiter was friendly but also very casual and inattentive. For example, he got our drink orders wrong and splashed us with water refills, and we would repeatedly have to follow-up on requests that he'd forgotten, etc. etc.  To be honest, this place probably deserves a +1* just because there aren't many Thai restaurants in Henderson - but based on my visit here, the reality is I doubt I'd go again.",

I, on the other hand, was born and raised in New York where there are so many different restaurants. We walked in and immediately thought we might not like it there because it was absolutely empty. There was one other couple on their way out.   Eve was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful when it came to deciding what to get from the menu. Our water glasses were never empty and she checked in a couple of times to make sure everything was ok.  We decided to order the pad Thai with beef and Massaman curry with chicken. Though I thought it was delicious, the pad Thai was a bit too sweet for my liking but the hubby loved it. The beef was tender and there was a generous amount. The Massaman curry was absolutely scrumptious! The pieces of chicken were very tender and they practically melted in my mouth. The sauce was savory, sweet with a bit of spice. Their servings are generous and it was too much for the two of us. We ended up taking the leftovers home and had a yummy dinner too!   I highly recommend this place. They're clean, service is quick, and the food is great!",

Probably my favorite curry out of all the thai places I've tried. Spicy scale here is 1-4 and I ordered a 1. Enough to taste the spice, but not too spicy to overwhelm the hint of sweetness.

    "text": "I went to this place because Yelp had a good rating and this was closer to home than my usual Thai place.  What a disappointment!!!!  We had shrimp and chicken Pad Thai at our table and also green curry salmon.  We were the only people at a table at 5:30pm on a Wednesday, and that should have been my first clue.  In general, the flavors were good but the textures were terrible.  The pad thai was heavy and gummy and did not taste fresh.  The noodles had a good consistency if you could get past what covered them.  All of the vegetables in all of the dishes were overcooked and limp, especially the bok choy in the salmon dish.  The salmon, however, was cooked appropriately.  As has been said by others, the green curry was very, very, watery.  In fact it was thinner than the diet Coke I had with it.  The mix on their fountain machine was also not correct as there was little carbonation and a slightly acrid flavor.  To add insult to injury, two of us ordered our dishes spicy (they used a 1 to 4 scale), and they came back extremely mild.  When I looked at the final bill, it was clear the waiter did not put our spice level on the order for the two of us that ordered spicy, but did put it on one of the pad thais that was supposed to be mild.  That said, since we were the only ones at a table, the service was quick.  The owner's wife came out and asked if we needed anything, but she was so nice we didn't really want to tell her the truth.  Perhaps she'll read this review.  I cannot understand why the yelp rating of this place is so high.  I've noticed that recent ratings were somewhat low.  Perhaps this place has gone downhill....",

Let me preface this review by saying I've been here 4 or 5 times prior and it's always been a solid 4-star experience.  So when I came in with family from out of town I had high expectations.   It was Saturday night and the team there seemed overwhelmed by the number of tables.  We were seated next to a few people who were waiting for take-out, and nobody approached our table for quite a while because our server got pulled into smoothing things over with a take-out customer who'd experienced an inordinately long wait.    When she finally arrived our server was sweet as pie and made a point of apologizing for the wait and joking with the table.  We ordered an appetizer (Crispy Shrimp) and 4 entrees (Volcano Chicken, Red Curry, Pad Thai, and Laab Gai...my favorite and something I use as a benchmark for thai restaurants).  Then another long wait, 25 minutes while we enjoyed 2 large Singha...and our appetizer came out.  The Crispy Shrimp were delicious, well-seasoned and piping hot but were served ala tempura plate with a bunch of fried veggies that were not mentioned on the menu description.  They were all room temperature, gummy and unappetizing--clearly everything hadn't been fried at one time and as everybody knows cold is the death of fried food.  Our first entree the Volcano Chicken arrived and it was likewise at room temperature.  Not even slightly warm, had clearly been sitting on a counter not even under a heat lamp for at least 10 minutes.  It was a basic sweet and sour and not really to my liking overall, but being cold definitely didn't help.    Luckily our other entrees didn't show up for a while so after some conversation--my partner and I are loath to make waves when eating out unless necessary--we explained our discontent to the server and asked her to make sure the remaining 3 entrees came out hot.  She was extremely apologetic and our Pad thai and Red curry came out quickly.  They were hot and delicious, only complaint was that they definitely didn't measure up to the spice levels we'd requested.  The Laab Gai arrived really late to the point where we thought they'd forgotten we'd ordered it.  Temperature was good, spice level was low and it was lacking in acid...maybe on account of the current lime shortage? Not the best I've had but I'd give it another shot on a return visit.  Sensing our overall discontent our server and another woman I have to think is the manager or owner came by and let us know they were taking the Volcano Chicken off the bill.  This went a long way in improving our experience and will ensure we continue to dine here...were I rating service alone this would've been a 5 star visit.",

    "text": "Summary:   I wanted to be, but I am not in love. I had high hopes, but I feel they were a bit dashed. As for authenticity? I don't know, I am not in the kitchen when they prepare things (though some of the other reviews make me wonder if *they* are... interpret as you wish).  Slightly longer version:  I stopped in here with high expectations. I ordered three items to go and used the Yelp check-in special for 10% off my order.  -- Curry puffs  A little overcooked but, by far, the star of the show. 7 or 8 large, flavorful, puffs with cucumber relish (more like a cucumber salad, if we're going to be accurate).   I really liked that they were snap-crispy on the outside and slightly over-browned. Personal preference? Not usually, as some was a little more than over-browned. BUT, against the soft, tender, flavorful filling? It was perfect. It had to be an accident as no one would cook these to the point of almost burnt in some spots, but it somehow worked here.  -- Chicken Tom Kha (soup)  I am at a loss. The flavors were really good and the heat was perfect. The chicken and mushrooms were tender. But the texture of the soup itself was... the only way to describe it was that there is either a powdered component that wasn't properly mixed in or, worse, something curdled? It had a grainy, thick, unmixed feel and look to it.  Now, you may point out that this was take out. However, I have had Thai soups delivered or taken home from much greater distances. I considered that and after much hoping, realized it was, in fact, the soup.   :(  -- Panang with Tofu (curry)  Unfortunately, I didn't get panang with tofu as much as I got tofu with a little panang. Not nearly enough curry for what they charge and not at all what I was expecting. The curry was more like a sauce for the tofu instead of being the main dish I ordered. The flavors, like the soup, were great. A little less on the herbs, a lot less on the tofu, and more - please! - of the panang. The heat was not spot on like the soup, but it was close.  Damn! I really was excited about this place, too!  Overall, a lackluster experience. The stars definitely come from the flavors and the puffs... but there are enough \"oh, no....\" moments to make me sad about it.  To be absolutely fair, I will be going back and dining in, taking a person or people with me who also love Thai food. I want so badly for this to be a good place, but based on this one meal? It's a cross between Meh, I have had better and A-OK. I will err on the positive and see what happens next time.",

    "text": "Was so wanting to love this place. Maybe my expectations were too high since other yelp reviews were good. I was rushed off phone when I finished the order & asked for a price \"I'll call you back\", click, didn't even get to ask for brown rice with my curry. My pumpkin curry was super bland & definitely not medium in heat level, plus they didn't give me the extra chili peppers I requested. I may be a white, born & raised in New England person, but I want to break a sweat when I order spicy Thai. They say their spicy scale is 1-4, so I asked for 3, but no heat maybe a 2 on my beloved Thai Noodle House's 1-10 scale. Luckily I had a jar of sliced green Thai chilies at home, but had to add about 2 tablespoons which added heat but some flavor would have been nice too.  Tried his pad see ew after he declared it \"horrible\". I'd never met a pad see ew I didn't like, until now. Noodles sticky, probably from the starch, not the sauce which was also bland. Plus the veggies in it were not the same as other Thai restaurants - only broccoli & collard-like greens.   I was hoping the food would have made up for the service both when I ordered & when he picked up. But sadly, this is not even on par with the other nearby Thai restaurants on Eastern & near Galleria which only deserved 1-2 visits each. Guess Henderson is not the place for good Thai - need to drive farther into Vegas.",

    "text": "Just finished having dinner here and the experience was pretty pleasant. I've been passing this restaurant for some time now but with Thai Thai just down the street, I've never popped in to check it out until now. What I loved most about this place was the ambiance. It's very clean and quaint. It's not what you would expect compared to other restaurants that hardly have decor, or you'd rather order take out than to sit down. My husband ordered the Panang curry with chicken. It wasn't anything spectacular but it was still pretty good (wasn't a fan of the peas), plenty of chicken. I ordered the crispy rice salad and I would not recommend it. It tasted like I was eating rice crispy cereal. Only good part was the dressing they give you on the side. I ate maybe a quarter of it and boxed up the rest. Best parts of the dinner was their Thai tea (they give you simple syrup on the side to sweeten yourself) and the mango and sticky rice for dessert (can't really go wrong with this dish). Service was excellent. Very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Refilled water any chance they had. It's not exactly the place I'd go when I'm really craving Thai food. But I'd probably go back because it's so near me and I want to check out the happy hour. Happy Hour: tues-fri from 3-6pm. $2 beers and $4-5 bite size dishes.",

    "text": "The Beginning:  A friend and I have ate at this location before and it wasn't memorable - besides the fact that the catfish was too overcooked the first time around. Today, I decided to give it another shot for dinner. When my friend and I got there initially, there were four tables - three already eating and one couple waiting for their order. We sat down next to two other couples and ordered the larb gai lettuce cups. After ordering, the other table was waiting for their food and becoming impatient as he kept sighing and exhaling deeply.   The Middle:  I understood his frustration shortly after - it took 30-35 minutes just to get our appetizer - the larb gai. The larb gai itself was underwhelming - the chicken was overcooked and all the seasoning in the center of the dish where the broth was. My friend tasted a small spoonful and didn't bother eating it though she was hungry. By this time, the restaurant starting to get their dinner crowd and there was a total of  eight tables, along with to-go orders. We were trying to get a busser or another server's attention since our server was nonexistent for most of the meal. I had to raise my voice to get the busser to finally come over. When I did get his attention, I had inquired what was taking so long, he walked to the back to check. I watched him walk back to where the kitchen drape was, but he didn't bother going through. By this time, 50 minutes have passed and I had to again, raise my voice to get attention of the busser as he was going by the other tables but ours. I asked him if he checked on our meal, he said it's coming (he still didn't physically walk in the kitchen area to check since the last time I spoke to him). Finally, an hour into walking in the restaurant, I had to wave my arm to our waitress and ask what was taking  so long. By this time, my friend and I were becoming uneasy and irritated. She said that it'd take another 10 minutes for the food to come and we were trying to explain that we were already waiting for an hour. We had a schedule to keep and had to tell her that if we didn't get our food before the 10 minutes, we have to leave to keep our appointment. The first dish came out five minutes later, followed by the two other soon after. The dinner was composed of:  Basil Chicken Fried Rice: It was lacking taste - there wasn't enough salt or pepper and it was bland. We asked for it to be medium spice and it just wasn't there. The only Basil taste I got was when you bit into the basil leaf itself - the flavors were not throughout the dish.  Garlic Eggplant - We get this dish at every Thai restaurant we go and it was not physically appealing to look it. The sauce looked like it was watered down and the eggplant itself had a unflattering color to it. We don't ever judge a dish by its presentation so we decided to taste. There was no taste to the dish - the sauce was bland and the eggplant was overcooked. We also asked for the dish to be medium spice and there was NONE. Two dishes in a Thai restaurant that lack spice is certainly a new one for me.  Pad Thai Chicken - The sauce itself was there - it had just the right amount of sweet, along with the medium spice. However, the noodles were undercooked - the noodles raw or too chewy. The noodles themselves were actually the incorrect noodles - the noodles were glass noodles (transparent rice noodles I believe).  I don't recall having anything else other than flat rice noodles for this dish and it wasn't a pleasant experience.  The End:  We finished our \"meal\" within several minutes of receiving it and we just wanted to leave. By this time, it seems like the entire staff was avoiding us. Finally, a different, more cheerful busser came by our table to check up on us. We were in the middle of telling him why we didn't enjoy our meal and the waitress came over to check on us. When we told her about the entrees, she took them away and presented our check - removing only the two entrees we didn't touch. Really?! After making us wait for over a hour, not having the decency to apologize for the wait, or for the meal for that matter, and dropping off the check not saying anything? We were beyond annoyed at this point and just paid and left.   If you are going to try this restaurant, I would suggest going during their lunch time. The dinner crowd seems it is overwhelming for the kitchen and the staff. We were grateful for the attentive young busser at the end, but we cannot overlook the rest of the experience. I don't think I have been in a situation like this before. I have been in the restaurant business for almost ten years and there was no way it would've gotten this far for any of my guests.",

I ordered the thai ice tea, which is SO YUMMY, but you can't have a free refill on them :(   I also ordered an appetizer called little gift baskets or something, and it was very good, well worth it. There were 4 of them, quite small, but filled with delicious chicken. Then ordered the vegetarian pad thai. Now this is where I got a little disappointed. It was a little below average for me. It left a metallic after-taste in my mouth for the rest of the day. I've had tastier pad thai. You'll probably have better luck ordering a different main dish. It seems people really like them, as the whole time people kept coming in picking up their To-Go orders.

    "text": "Surprisingly, we were not expecting to find a nicely decorated restaurant with such vibrant aesthetics.  Being tucked away in the corner of Eastern Blvd and Horizon Ridge Pkwy, this is a dope spot for casual dining with a group or even with just a table for two.  --Thai beef jerky: great flavors from the spices they used to marinate the meat.  Dish comes with dipping sauce which wasn't too salty unlike what other joints usually serve.  Order a side of sticky rice and you're good to go.   --Spicy grilled beef salad: could have used extra toasted rice but the skirt steak was tender and chili-lime vinaigrette was good.   --Pad Thai: typical Thai style thin noodles sauteed with eggs, bean sprouts, chives and crushed peanuts.  Got it in 'hot' and thought it would've been 9/10 if it were from a different place.  **Spiciness from this establishment runs hotter than others... have your dish in 'medium' instead and just add more crushed peppers to suit your taste buds.   --Pineapple fried rice (shrimp, chicken, fresh pineapples, roasted cashews) that was actually served in whole pineapple shell.  I like the mixture of savory and sweet, however, seasoning was lacking as the dish was quite bland.  Overall, Gaati Thai Kitchen is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants around Southeast Las Vegas.  Delicious food, nice ambiance and great service.  They also have a daily happy hour with drink specials and reduced price on certain appetizers.",

We started out with a green papaya salad called Som Tum and curry chicken puffs.  The salad was delicious!  Tangy, savory, clean, refreshing, crisp, nutty, with a hint of heat.  The puffs...they are so good that we both could have eaten more.  We then had chicken panang and pad thai.  Both were scrumptious.    Service was very good.  Refills before we had to ask, clean plates after our first courses, and they carried our leftovers to the back to package up for take away.  I would rate this place 4 1/2 out of 5.  Definitely a great Thai restaurant.",

    "text": "Average Thai food in comfortable dining room.  The room reminds me more of an art gallery than a restaurant, in a good way.  The food reminds me of many other mediocre Thai restaurants I've tried.    The prices here are a little high, but not ridiculous.  I would say come in for the lunch specials during the week to get the most out of Gaati Thai Kitchen.    I came in on President's day (a holiday so no lunch specials) and ordered fresh coconut juice, the curry puffs, and pad see ew, here's the rundown:  Young Coconut -  So refreshing and lovely.  Served with a straw and a spoon, if you've never tried this you really need to.  Be sure to scrape out all that yummy ivory coconut meat after you're done sipping.  The coconut juice pairs really well with spicy food, and it's good for you!  Curry Puffs - Nice fried appetizer.  The flavor of the puff itself wasn't too pronounced, but when eaten with some chili sauce and the cucumber salad/relish it's served with, a very nice way to start the meal out.  Pad See Ew (spicy level 6 out of 10)  - The chinese broccoli wasn't cooked enough, so it had too much crunch for the dish.  The noodles were a bit mushy and again, the flavor was muted.  I can't say it was bad, but it certainly wasn't anything special.    I like the people here and the layout of the restaurant, but that's about it.",

    "text": "I just ate a delicious, homey, perfectly-balanced bowl of (hot) pork green curry...hot to burn the lips but not the stomach...the lime leaf overwhelms your taste and smell...and the warm, light and creamy spoonful of mouthwatering heat only gets better as you bite down on crisp and delicious strips of bamboo shoot and sweet red pepper...and I got that (to go) at GAATI.  Given that last review (errata: plug), however, I can't wait to try Penn's on Sunset!   I will complain that I got NO spiders (not even a single cricket!) with my meal as I always do.  I mean, is this place ridiculous for not being what I expect a Thai place to be!!?? If not perfect, Gaati is pleasant and spotless.  I love their (AUTHENTIC) food, come here often and appreciate having it around.  So it's OK that one may like Penn's (and give it not one, but two, lengthy and STELLAR reviews...and wished there were more stars?), but I contest (apparently malicious) bug statements (unless some Spring fluke?).  Everyone is entitled to an opinion but some just aim to hurt...and if I agreed, we'd both be wrong.  I can't have enough good Thai food to eat (and I'm an awesome, AWESOME critic of Thai food)....so at least I would follow someone's advice for Penn's... \"Tip: If you have been here ONCE and maybe not had a five star experience, please give them another shot.\"  I bet those designs they make from straws really make one feel like \"family\".  If we can't be fair, maybe we SHOULD take our asses back to Applebee's.",

While I wouldn't say the food here tastes just like it does over there, this has definitely become my favorite new Thai restaurant. I've been here at least 5 or 6 times now and every time has been really good.   They do a really nice som tam (papaya salad) and their tom yum kai soup is good as well. I also recommend the jungle curry and their spicy basil is top notch! The only thing I've tried that I didn't think much of was their chicken satay. It was just kind of dry and flavorless, but everything else has been great! Good desserts as well and I'm not usually a dessert person. Also, if you order Thai iced tea, they will bring you a little cup of simple syrup so that you can sweeten it to your liking, which I really appreciate since I don't like it too sweet.   Service has always been great, but unfortunately they're always slow when I've gone in. Please come support this great restaurant!",

I ordered the Tom yum soup (hot) and got a bowl of bland broth (maybe just hot water?) with huge chunks of chicken and one shrimp, nothing more.  I also ordered the green curry (again hot) and it was literally the worst I've ever had.  Thai food is all about flavor, this was just tasteless blah.  I'm giving them two stars cause the brown rice was cooked perfectly and my friends pad Thai was ok, but again, just ok.  Very disappointing :-(",

Came on a Saturday night and got seated right away. The ambiance is casual but looks upscale on the inside. Super cute interior design with a modern touch. My favorite was the big island that had a few high top seatings. Everything was just super cute.  We started off wit their dumplings.. which were aaaamazing. You could tell they were handmade with love. For entrees we got pad see ew with tofu and panang curry with chicken. The pad see ew had just the right amount of sweet & salty, the sauce wasn't too over powering like some other places I've tried. The panang curry was also very tasty, for those of you that like coconut & peanut flavor. This curry is my fave! It was drizzled with a little coconut milk to top if off.   For the entrees you can also choose the spicy ness level from 1-4, so choose wisely!   I loved that service was quick and wasn't too crowded for the weekend. Can't wait to come back for my next Thai fix.",

    "text": "My friend was really craving Thai food for lunch today. The place was new to me, so naturally, I obliged.  Gaati Thai Kitchen is located on Eastern and Horizon Ridge near the now-closed K-Mart. I have nothing to report otherwise on the location because it was a to-go phoned-in order which I had nothing to do with other than eating.  Pad See Ew with Beef ($11): a little less rich than my preferred takes on the dish, but it had the right sauces, fairly luscious noodles, and crunchy Chinese broccoli. The mild spicy level was not that noticeable, which is fine with me. However, much of the beef was too chewy. I might shy away from beef if I were to order from here again.  Red Curry with Chicken ($11): not too much of a killer at medium heat aside from the one or two bites of chili pepper which I encountered. Definitely enjoyed the coconut and peanut notes in the sauce and the various veggies, including zucchini, bamboo shoots, and bell peppers. White rice, included in the order, was fine.  Main issue for me, other than the beef, was the pricing. The portions are comparable with other Thai restaurants where entrees cost only $7-$9, and the flavors are on par at best.  Gaati is fine if you're stuck in the neighborhood, but it's not necessary at all to go out of your way to try their overpriced takes on typical Thai cuisine. There are cheaper spots all over town if you want slightly better food, as well as significantly better restaurants if you're going to pay double digits.",

Well we wish it were that way, I ordered the yellow curry and it was absolutely TERRIBLE  it taste like straight coconut milk poured over the beef, potatoes and carrots .. way to sweet you couldn't even taste the curry! The potatoes were mushy and way over cooked and the carrots were hard and undercook .. couldn't even eat it, went straight in to the trash! My spouse ordered the spicy catfish he was extremely disappointed, catfish was so fatty in texture and I tasted it and it sure was, it honestly taste like bad quality fish maybe they should switch suppliers?!?? The dish was also under spiced and cold! What a waste of our hard earned money ..We ended up going and getting food else where!",

When I did a yelp search for thia food Gaati was rated #1 and so I assumed it would be great food and the Thia fix I needed. No. My red curry was basically tasteless and my tum yum with shrimp had no lemongrass aromas freshness that I enjoy so much. It tastes like boring sweet and sour soup. Even my Thai tea was a dud. I placed an order online and had to go back because they forgot to add the rice for the curry :/  Like I said, my over all experience  and food wAs Bla  at best.

Doesn't come cucumbers or carrots on the side anymore.   The Pad Thai was not good either, it was dry and not what pad Thai should be, seemed like it was missing a lot of ingredients.  We only gave it two stars because the Wonton soup was good.  Very disappointing I would definitely skip this place and head to Le Thai downtown.  The food is delicious and prices are great.",

    "text": "Gaati has a solid 4 star review on Yelp, it should be 4.5-5. Seems many of the complaints come from reviews on dishes that are Americanized or Chinese in nature... Here's my tip... Don't order those!!!   My mom and I came here on an early Friday night, I enjoyed the interior, it was not as \"gallery-esque\" as many of the other reviews stated. In my opinion, it is simple, clean, & modern. Nothing wrong with that!! It was although smaller than I had expected, but this makes for quiet, quick, attendant service.   For the food:  - appetizer: Papaya salad. Very yummy and perfect for summertime. It's cool and crisp with chilled shrimp on top, and thin cabbage leaves to make a wrap if you desire. Everywhere else that I've had this dish (including my grandma's) is way too spicy, even when ordered mild, this dish on the other hand could have actually used more spice... So for next time I know! If you've never had papaya salad, and are unfamiliar with fish sauce, this will be entirely new for you!   -entree: Green curry with chicken. I was SO pleased with this dish. I know how I want my green curry, and this was perfect! It was creamy with the perfect amount of heat. Perfect balance of bamboo shoots and Thai basil, yum! Plus, what I find lacking in many curry dishes is the quality of the chicken... This chicken was memorable, tender and cut into strips, whereas other restaurants seem to make the chicken a weak accessory to the dish. They have green peas in this, which is new to me... but they were rare, so I didn't mind, haha. Also, they don't skip out on the rice here, hallelujah!!!!   My mom got yellow curry and enjoyed it very much and kept saying, \"mmm, just like mom's!\" Neither of us finished and were able to take home a generous amount of leftovers while also leaving quite satisfied!   Another thing I should remark on is the price, I don't feel it is over priced, it is pretty standard especially for the quality and location. The two of us dined for $44 with two specialty drinks, an appetizer, & two entrees... Not bad, not bad at all!   So try out a little, hidden, Henderson gem for some satisfying Thai food. I may be their new regular!",

I thought I would get more than just 1 3/4 cup of soup. It was REALLY sour. I ordered it medium spicy and it didn't taste spicy at all. The broth was flavorless and the chicken was tough.  Overall, If this place wants to charge Lotus of Siam prices for Lotus of Siam portion sizes, they better have amazing food... unfortunetely its subpar. You'll get better portion sizes for a cheaper price with better quality food at the Pin Kaow down the road on Eastern about 3 minutes away.",

Our party ordered sweet and sour chicken lunch special and it came with salad, soup and a hefty stuff wonton. The portions were a good size. Someone else order crab friend rice and wow was it good. I ordered pad thai and it was decent. WARNING: Their spice range is on point. When they say hot...It's going to be hot. My lips and tongue were on fire! When your brow sweats you know it's hot.

We asked for medium in the curry and got mild and salty curry.  I'm not sure if this was an off night,  but it was disappointing to say the least.    We've tried them a few times in the past, but nothing was compared to this meal. The food has really been so-so and inconsistent.",

Gaati got it right tonight.  I'm very happy to upgrade my rating of Gaati. Immediately after the first review, I was contacted by the restaurant's Manager/Owner. She asked for another chance. Tonight, we did just that.  We had chicken pad Thai, crab rangoons, chicken satay, and the garlic edamame. It was all delicious. It was waiting for me; hot, fresh, and tasty. I will certainly go a third time now. Especially for the edamame. The garlic sauce was perfect. ~~ the only thing that would have made it all perfect? MORE. Peace all.  Robert  ps -- I hope they are doing a really good take-out business. The dining room was vacant. Please, give them some love. And your business. rg",

The crispy duck was $20 for a small portion that was mostly batter The soup wasn't bad but it wasn't the best And the Thai tea... didn't taste like your typical Thai tea   Over all I'd rather go to archis which is also on eastern .",

First I was super impressed when we walked in by the ambience of the restaurant! Everything was so clean and well decorated. They had music playing in the background at the perfect volume so you can have a conversation in a low voice and sit across from each other.The choice of music was also great it was calm but upbeat. I ordered the pork fried rice with a level 1 spice and my girlfriend ordered the yellow curry. Everyone that works here is so attentive and nice. The customer service is really impeccable. I have never had curry before and I tried my girlfriend's meal and it was amazing ! At first I was a little hesitant because the smell and color but, I was not disappointed! You could taste every single ingredient in the curry and the bbq rice. Everything was elegantly presented and just beautiful. The rice was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. The spice was exactly right so you could taste the food but, it had a little kick ! I 100% recommend this place to anyone who enjoys clean and delicious Thai food !!",

I noticed most of the people in the restaurant looking annoyed by not having their food, or waiting for service, etc. Such an embarrassment.

I was craving Thai food the other night and hadn't had Thai food on this side of town before but the yelp pictures for Gaati Thai Kitchen looked so good I immediately called in my order for takeout.  I ordered my standby of chicken pad Thai and after seeing the photos, added an order of the pineapple fried rice as well. I liked getting to choose the spice level for each of the dishes (a little spicy for the pad Thai and as mild as possible for the pineapple fried rice as I knew I'd be sharing that for lunch the following day). The pad Thai was nutty and delicious and everything I had hoped for (I probably could've made two meals out of the order as well but it was so good I couldn't resist) but the major stand out was the pineapple fried rice. It was sweet, savory, and had an amazing slightly curry taste. The rice was filled with cashews, chicken, a few shrimp, and plenty of pineapple. That did make 2 generous servings and I will be going back for that dish especially.   In total, I think I've found a Thai restaurant to go to on this side of the valley which I'm really excited about. I like that they have both a really nice looking dining room to dine in but that I can also call and pick up a super tasty meal. The price felt a little expensive, but with the 2 dishes I could've gotten 4 generous servings out of it, and everything was so good that the price was more than worth it.",

    "text": "I am addicted to good Thai food, so while having a conversation about the subject a friend of mine suggested Gaati and their delicious menu. After lounging around all day yesterday, my girl and I decided to go for a nice/casual dinner so we arrived at Gatti at about 5pm. Tucked away next to Kmart, this place was nicely decorated, played relaxing music and the service was immediate and courteous. We were offered wine and presented with the menu for the evening which contained typical dishes along with some house specialties...and they all sounded amazing.  We started out with the Gaati rolls, which came with a delicate and flavorful pork stuffing and a homemade pineapple/citrus dipping sauce. We have never had such meaty rolls and complementary dip... they were the perfect start to our meal.  For our meal we ordered the pineapple chicken and the masaman curry, both accompanied with basmati rice. Both dishes were incredibly fresh and had delicate flavors that were expertly combined for our enjoyment. The portions were about right, maybe a bit small, but the flavor and service made the experience an enjoyable one.  The owner (or the person in charge) checked in with us often and was happy to suggest different dishes. When we let her know it was our first time at the restaurant, she brought out a coconut ice cream for us to try... What a nice treat! Thank you guys very much for a great evening.",

Many Thai restaurants I've been to try to put too much sugar in the food and it doesn't taste right, but Gaati has the right amount of heat, great flavors and just a really pleasant presentation of food!   I absolutely love this place!  What we ordered:  1. Treasure bags--very crispy, very flavorful chicken and corn filling, amazing appetizer  2. Satay pork--perfectly cooked.  delicious marinade  3.  chicken curry puffs--really good  4. Pad Thai--best Pad Thai in America!   Very spicy, very fresh, it's just so different from the other pad thai's I've had!  5. Pad kra pow chicken--chicken with chili and basil, it's so delicious with rice.  6.  Chicken Tom Kah--really dense broth with very good flavors.    Great openner to any dish.  7. Fresh green curry--OMG so fresh it's amazing!  8. Crispy pork belly with Chinese broccoli--excellent flavors, crispy, and the gai lan is still a bit crunchy which is nice  9. the minced chicken dish served in lettuce cups--very refreshing!  All in all, I love this place.   I would drive from LA to Henderson just for this restaurant!",

Glance at the lunch menu (somewhat limited) and quickly decide our orders. Placed our order, and began to wait. And wait. And wait. About 20 minutes later, we saw the cook walk through the front door! Next thing we hear are pots and pans shuffling around and finally some food being cooked. About 10 minutes later, we finally get our soup and salad. Then about 5-10 minutes after that, food arrives.  The food was pretty decent, but portion size was small for the spicy basal and sweet and sour chicken. Pad Thai was a good portion, however we only received 2 shrimp with the combination plate. Just 2? Hmm.. We ended up being late to work because it took so long. Why open the restaurant if the cook isn't there? Just an overall bad experience that unfortunately helped us decide never to return.",

It was exactly what I was looking for- fresh, the flavors were perfectly married, and it wasn't too light, too heavy, it was just right. It hit the spot! I ordered the lunch special: the curry puff was absolutely delicious, full of chicken, carrots, curry and potatoes in some kind of pastry. Yumm!! The egg drop soup was light and flavorful and the small side salad had a nice sesame type dressing on it. The green curry with jasmine rice was amazing! Exactly how a good green curry should be, with crispy tofu (that's what I ordered) just right potatoes, zucchini and bamboo shoots with the perfect amount of crunch plus some yummy Thai basil thrown in. I have definitely found our new Thai place and am so glad have it a second chance!",

I tried their veggie medley with tofu and their fish cake salad  (forgot the actual name). Both were really good. These were two new dishes for me but you can't go wrong with stir fry veggies and tofu w/ brown rice. The veggies were perfectly cooked (cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, tomatoes, and broccoli) and the tofu (firm) was nicely marinated and slightly fried. I got the dish a medium spice level but it wasn't hot at all so I had to add garlic chili sauce to it when I got home. The fish cake salad was new for me so I didn't know what to expect from a fish cake. The texture is kinda different but it was ok for me. The salad came in a crispy taco shell like bowl full of lettuce, bell peppers and cucumbers with a side of vinegarette dressing that was yummy but it was super thick like a chutney so it was more of a dipping sauce than dressing. The staff is super nice and the decor is pleasant and good for a date night out. I'll definitely try it again.",

    "text": "Ok so here is my second review of Gaati Thai. The first one I made was after eating there for the first time last night for dinner (amazing) and the second one is now after having my second meal there for lunch today with my wife. I want to start by stating that I am a chef and usually don't try a new restaurant for at least a few months after they open in order to give them an opportunity to work out the kinks. The restaurant industry is really a tough one and it usually takes a little time to get the staff and chef working in a smooth and homogeneous fashion but after dropping in last night to look at the menu I decided to try it and I couldn't be happier. For lunch today I wanted to try new dishes so we ordered Chicken Satay, Chicken Tom kha , Eggplant Entree and Crispy Pork belly. For dessert we tried the Pumpkin Custard. Here is the break down.   Satay was great. Flavor was really good and liked the peanut sauce.  My one criticism of this dish was that it came out of the kitchen warm and not hot.   The Tom kha was also Great but also a little on the warm side and could have been a little hotter. and it did have that curdled look also (I think that comes from using fresh coconut milk over the canned stuff)   The Eggplant was Fantastic, Tender, not greasy and the flavor was incredible.   The Crispy Pork Belly was flavor wise an 11 on a 1-10 scale but the pieces of pork Belly were on the smaller side so when fried to crisp them up suffered a little and came out a little dry (really just a little) but would benefit from being cut a little larger so that they remain tender and moist when being crisped up.   The Pumpkin custard was Sublime. Warm (in a good way) not to overly sweet like some Thai desserts can be.   Over all I want anyone interested in giving this place a try to know that they will really be trying out a special place. This is better than Lotus of Siam and I LOVE LOTUS OF SIAM. This Place has just been open for a little over a week and they are putting out amazing food. Cant wait to see what they will be serving in a few months.",

I decided to go for Lunch the same day, which I'm glad I  did.  I have been here 3 times for Lunch and once for dinner, my girlfriend and I both agree that Gaati Thai Kitchen remains by far the best Thai food I've had on both coasts.  My favorite dish there, the Pad Thai, is better than the Pad Thai I've had in Thailand. The noodles are firm, never soggy, and the flavor is always well balanced. The Chicken (a must) is extremely fresh, large quantity, and generous. Their curries are all fantastic -- over the course of four visits, my favorite curry has grown to be the Massaman curry. Chicken Tom Kah,Crab Fried Rice are awesome too.  Friendly staff makes the atmosphere even better. Their desserts are great (especially Gaati Thai Sundae and Fried Banana with Thai Coconut Ice Cream)  I recommend going there for lunch, as although the portions are good, the prices are a LOT cheaper (approx $9 will get you a nice lunch special) Parking is convenient so  you can cross that of the list.",

    "text": "My friends and I were recently celebrating a bachelorette party in Vegas, and instead of splurging at one of the uber expensive strip hotel restaurants, we decided to get Thai food delivered to Mandalay Bay - The Hotel.  It worked out perfectly--the food arrived as crispy and fresh as ever (chicken curry puffs and veggie egg rolls--oh my GAH *drool*), and we were able to play pre-party bachelorette games while chowing down!  The food was a hit with everyone.  If you want \"Americanized\" Thai, this place may be a bit different.  The food here is authentic, with dishes and flavors you might not find at mainstream Thai restaurants.  I'm from LA, where there's no shortage of Thai establishments, but having experienced the food here, I'm really sad we don't have a place like this in my hometown.  If you had a family member or friend in Thailand who happened to be an awesome chef, these are the types of dishes you could expect to find when invited over for dinner.  Just thinking about that meal now is making me hungry.  Gaati Thai Kitchen--come to Los Angeles!!",

The decor is beautiful and calming. The staff was so polite and helpful! Our server Francisco was great! I do not eat meat so he offered great options and they doubled my veggies!  We started with a shrimp soup that was so delicious! It was very light  and fresh with huge shrimp! I ordered the jungle curry which is a perfection option for those who do not want coconut milk. My husband ordered the pork belly and broccoli and he loved it! The broccoli was so green and fresh also.  We went during happy hour and got $2.00 beers! They also offer $4 and $5 food options and lunch specials. I never find places that make food spicy enough for me but I could tell by they authenticity our started I ordered my curry hot, not Thai hot like I usually do. Hot at Gaati IS hot! It was sooo good! The wonder came over twice to make sure everything was perfect and asked if it was our first time. We answered yes and she was so thoughtful by bringing us a free dessert of homemade ice cream. We will definitely be returning customers!",

Here's my breakdown:  1 star belongs to ambiance of the restaurant.  It's quiet and somewhat romantic.    2 stars belong to the quality of the food.  We tried the shrimp tom yum soup, papaya salad, red curry with chicken, spicy eggplant with tofu and pad thai.  The food was either bland or too salty.  The only thing I would rave about is their shrimps.  Their shrimps were really fresh.    Unfortunately, I won't be returning to Gaati Thai Kitchen for its food.",

My regular lunch buddy has strict dietary limitations; Gaati modifies everything so he can eat a real meal.   Prices on the entrees are a tad higher than some other Thai restaurants in town, but I taste the difference in the food. Definitely worth the difference.  The lunch special is awesome for a mere $9 - soup, salad, a curry puff and a main dish with rice. Brown rice is available for an extra buck.   Closed Mondays, so plan accordingly.",

We ordered the yellow chicken curry (hot), pork pad see ew (hot), crispy rice salad (hot), spicy basil (hot), crab fried rice (hot), and bbq spare ribs.  Food can be ordered on a scale from \"not hot\" to \"Thai hot\", with \"hot\" being the 2nd to highest.  They did a nice job on the heat!  We forgot to order the curry with no heat, and my son's poor girlfriend was drinking milk (which she doesn't enjoy) to try to cool her burning mouth.  The rest of us loved it!  I really liked the crispy rice salad - it was nice having a cool dish, and the lettuce and rice were crisp.  The pad see ew was very good as well, with the flavors well married but not overly sweet and the broccoli was perfectly cooked.  The crab fried rice was a nice surprise and something new to try - it was very tasty with nice sizes of crab meat.  The spicy basil had a nice basil flavor but was a bit too sweet.  I was too full by then and never got around to trying the curry or ribs.  When I picked up the order, the restaurant was quiet.  It's very pretty, with cloth tabletops and a relaxing vibe.  I like the view of the outdoor landscaping from the side glass door.  Our To Go order came served in rectangle plastic containers (yea! no styrofoam) with clear lids, and for the most part the servings were quite generous.  The odd one was the spicy basil, which was quite a small portion and the curry was a smaller portion than expected (served in a plastic cylinder-shaped container).  Thank you, Gatti Thai, for a lovely meal!",

Not a bad portion size however, the edamame were pretty sad looking. I was expecting full, plump edamame but was disappointed in the quality of it. It was like they microwaved a bag from the freezer section and put it on the plate. I had to ask for a plate for the shells. It wasn't busy at all but the waiters were not moving with any sense of urgency when being asked for things by the 3 patrons eating lunch.  I ordered the spicy eggplant which is something I always order from thai places. This one was extremely greasy and when I asked for mild heat, I didn't know that meant ZERO heat because I didn't even taste a hint. I ordered it with vegetables instead of rice and there were barely any added to the entree. I'll probably look for another thai place in the area rather than coming back here.",

    "text": "Tried the $9 special with the Green Curry Chicken and I must say it was pretty good. It's a great lunch special to get three courses for that price. You get a soup, small salad nothing special but the dressing is bomb.  The veggies are what stand out most. They are fresh and cut very well and integrated into the curry to perfection.  I'll be returning to try the Yellow Curry which is my personal favorite. Decor is super nice, and it's worth the $9 lunch special. Thai Tea also perfect. Why not a 5 star? Wasn't that blown away by the Green Curry and maybe it could've used more chicken but hey, it's a lunch special.  Worth a try. Enjoy.  I'm bumping it to a full 5 stars. Just had the Spicy Basil Chicken and it was so bomb. Only thing is you'll be craving more.",

Its located in the Kmart parking lot next to this lash salon and Idk what else. As I walked in i was hesitant on the food since there was only one other couple.   I ordered my usually skeptical meal for a Thai place of Pah thai with tofu, yellow curry, jasmine rice and papaya salad. Everything and I mean everything was amazing!!! How can this place be empty?!?!!   Service was great, ambiance was chill, music was nice, restaurant was super clean, etc etc etc!!!   The most recent visit we ordered papaya salad, sea bass, and pad Thai. The fish was steamed to  perfection! We wanted the fried fish but they were sold out!!!! Next time...but she said the steamed was better anyways and I was sold. It came with fresh ginger ans bak choy with a thick kinda soy sauce...amazing!   I hope this place gets its recognition but please don't get too busy when I come",

    "text": "I will be coming back here for sure!  First time here, after reading the reviews, I was a bit skeptical and was planning to head to my favorite Siri Thai.  However, I figured I needed to go outside my comfort zone and so we tried out Gaati and overall very happy.  1.  Ambiance - Easy access, parking and location is great on the Northeast corner of Horizon Ridge and Eastern, near the K-Mart.  The interior decor is very well done, excellent contrast of light and dark which sets a very modern comfortable mood.  Casual or more upscale, that would be up to you.  I give the Ambiance a 5 star.  2.  Service - Ok, I must admit we came in here at 4:00 pm on a Sunday before their busy hours, so this has to be put into perspective.  The service was great, very at attentive, checking on our choices and food all times, keeping my ice water and my hot Jasmine tea always filled.  Service is 5 star.  3,  Food - Being the first time, we ordered more dishes than we could eat, to get a good taste:  Spicy - We ordered everything medium and found it to be just the right amount with a bit of a kick. I normally like ti a bit hotter, however, the wifey likes it less spicy. I found the balance of spice to be nice.  a.  Tom Yam Soup - We ordered the hot pot version of this soup with Chicken as it was listed on the menu.  Now, we learned that the menu does not say so, yet you can order this with any meat you want.  It was a bit expensive, yet light and tasty at the same time. To me, this soup is suppose to be very light and delicate and I am used to having more robust soup, so it was very nice to have it so delicate.  For those of you not use to this, it may be a different experience.  I give the soup a 4 star.  b.  Pad Kee Mau - Drunken Noodles, the stuff you eat if you are from Thailand and had a late night drink binge.  Very tasty, very nice texture of the wide / broad noodle. I rather enjoyed the taste very much. A favorite of mine. I give it a 5 star.  c.  Eggplant with Ground Pork - I order this dish at every place I go to try and compare.  Here it was a nice mix of red bell pepper, onion eggplant and ground pork.  Now, I liked this here, however, it had more of a gravy that I attribute to chinese stir fry and usually not Thai, so I was not expecting this.  I overall liked it and will give it a 4 star.  d.  Massaman Curry - I had this with Beef. I learned from the team there at Gaati that it is traditional to have it with Beef, however, they can do chicken, just takes longer to cook.  I really enjoyed it. Nice spice to it and very nice tasty chunks of beef.  Not sliced, chunks!  I give this a 4 star.  e.  Fried Rice with BBQ - Ordered this to go home for the kiddies along with all the left overs we had.  Decent portion, I paid 5.00 for extra pork portion.  So, this made it 16.00 for a nice tasting, yet small portion of fried rice.  For sure it is a must try, yet 16.00 is a bit steep for fried rice in my book. I give this a 3 star.  I will be coming back. The people here make you feel welcome, at home and are part of the great experience. Check this place out!!!!",

A very nice lady told me that it had just went out for delivery and if I hadn't gotten it within 10 minutes to please call back. 30 minutes later... nothing. I called and a man tells me that hey never received my order but I was very close and they could have it to me in 10 minutes if I still wanted it. I'm not sure how he knew I was close because I hadn't told him my address, only my name to find the order (which they never got). It seems they had gotten the order and misplaced it, which is fine if they would have just admitted their mistake. He offered a free Thai iced tea for the trouble. I clarified my order twice with him to not have onions... it showed up with massive chunks of onion, over 2 1/2 hours late, and full price. I am incredibly disappointed & don't believe I will be dining here again.",

    "text": "We ordered our food and drinks. The waiter didn't even have a pen and paper to write our order. When he delivered our beer and poured into the glass . Beer bubbles all over the glass. I told him let me show you how to pour beer correctly. If you're selling beer you should know how to pour beer correctly with no beer bubbles all over! I really don't like to drink my cold beer with all the bubbles. If I am ordering beer on tap then that's totally different. Then our order came in differently with what we expected. The waiter didn't even explained to us that there are two of the same name but different style of preparation. How would the customer know that they have two different style of preparation with same name . So when the food was delivered I was looking for the noodles and he said we ordered the soup. So I said my hubby even pointed out to you what he wanted and you still gave us something different . He should have explained and told Us that we ordered the  soup and not the noodles . The customer won't know that you guys have two of the same name but different preparation.  Will never go back because the waiter insisted that we were the ones that ordered the wrong food.  Had he explained to us we should have known that they have two of the same name but different preparation. Then thats totally another thing.  Super frustrated. But since there's a lot of thai restaurant in the neighborhood why go back to this one when they won't even admit their mistakes!  Not that I wanted to get a free meal! All I wanted to hear is for him to say \"so sorry my mistake\" but he still insisted that it was our mistake. Even though I told him you should have advised us that they have two of the same name but different preparations. But nope he didn't !!!  Well the food sucks anyway . The soup was very very sweet. Taste like I ordered a desert. Not authentic thai soup. I never tasted sweet soup from any thai restaurant I have been and even when we travelled in Thailand. We didn't order a desert soup!  Longest review ever!! should be helpful for everyone!",

I should've heeded the warnings!! Unfortunately, the noodles were drenched in oil and I had to try very hard to find the scamp pieces of chicken. The flavor itself was a bit bland as well. The restaurant interior was decorated nicely but I don't think the decor could save it from the less than mediocre food.   I don't really understand why this place has 4 stars since I paid $11 for Pad Thai that had both underwhelming portions and flavor.",

There are never more than a few other parties and it's always pretty quiet. The music is always pretty pleasant.  I like their crab rangoons, nice filling to crispy wrapper ratio. Spicy veggie pad Thai is a must have every time.  This would be a solid five star review, however, during a visit once our appetizer order of Treasure Bags came with 2.5 out of 4 of them burned from the bottom into the yummy filling. Instead of taking the plate and returning with a fresh and properly goldened order, they took two and replaced only two leaving us with one that would be considered \"well\" and the other \"extra super well/verge of burned.\" Also, I'm a fan of the \"1-10\" spice scale versus the \"mild, medium, hot, Thai hot\" scale... so I would change that too.",

It's too bad my boss and I were there smelly and disheveled from the field and looked like a couple of turds among the lilies.  But everyone who served us was very polite and quick, and I appreciate that.    The spring roll type appetizer was OK, though a bit overcooked.  Our entrees were also OK but not particularly good.  I asked for my pad thai medium spicy; Boss asked for his eggplant dish extra-super-spicy.  My pad thai was quite spicy (and I'm not a spicy wimp!), and my boss's eggplant dish was bland.  So they seem to have mixed up the heat levels between the two dishes.    My pad thai, besides being strangely spicy, was quite dry and bland and had neither basil nor lime.  And the shrimp, for which I'm sure I paid quite a bit extra, had that muddy flavor that tells me it's probably a good thing it was way-overcooked.  I suppose that's my fault for ordering any kind of seafood in the middle of the freaking desert.  I might eat here again, but I'd be one of those obnoxious people who specifies lots of things.  \"I'd like peanuts and basil and lime and cilantro and some actual flavor with my pad thai, please.\"",

When I finally took a bite, the Pad Thai was EXTREMELY hot when I asked for Medium. I noticed it was practically covered in Chili flakes. I politely asked if they could tone down the spicy and they took the plate back, all the while I heard the cooks and waiter talking junk about us in the kitchen. My boyfriend's food comes out and his isn't even hot. Almost another 15 minutes goes by until I get my new Pad Thai which was alot less spicy but also looked watery and soupy. Finally, after another 10 minutes my curry puffs that were supposed to come with my soup and salad come out and they are burnt to a crisp. I asked the waiter for new ones since I wouldn't be eating those. My boyfriend wanted to just walk out but I insisted we stay because I was hungry. Long story short, the waiter asked me AT LEAST 6 times if everything was ok. Felt kind of weird. When we were done,  I had to wait almost 15 more minutes for the check. Almost an hour after we get home from lunch, I'm vomiting constantly and although I might not have food poisoning, I am headed to the hospital. I truly believe these people did something shady to my food. I will never be back and I warn everyone that goes there about asking to fix or modify a dish might leave you in my situation. This place is my new least favorite restaurant. And just before you go judging my tone about this incident, my boyfriend and I both work as a server and a manager at 2 different restaurants here in Vegas, one off the strip and the other on the strip and neither of us had ever given or experienced as bad service as we dealt with today.",

    "text": "What I had: Roasted Duck and water (to drink)  Price: $20 + tax  The Good: The decor is decent.  The Bad: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for what it is and what it tastes like. I ordered the duck as I was trying to test out the different places that actually served duck. The worst part is that the waitress there had no clue what she was talking about and couldn't even answer my simple questions. I asked her what size the duck was (a whole duck, half duck, or just a single duck breast) and she had to go to the kitchen to find out. She actually lied to me because she told me it was a half (of a whole duck). I got 1/2 a breast it seemed. Also, the duck was horrible. I tasted more like that cheap dark meat they use in some honey chicken chinese dishes and the vegetables tasted like that frozen crap you get out of the grocery store. Like it was just thawed out. for that price ($20) I expected much much more. Even the little box of white rice they gave me tasted bland. Also, they gave me no free appetizers or anything to even snack on like most Asian restaurants would. I was just sitting there for 20 mins with a glass of water waiting for my duck.",

You may have to wait a little bit longer compared to some other places, but it is worth it!  Just a warning - the spicy is Thai spicy, so if you are not accustomed to that level of heat, order medium.",

    "text": "How nice to find a local Thai place that provides quality food, isn't greasy and has good variety. I wasn't as put off by the prices as some of the other reviewers. $11 seems to be the average price for the main courses. That's below many of the other local Thai restaurants in Henderson. The appetizer prices are a bit steeper ($8-$9) but the portion sizes were quite good.  Highlights: Appetizers - beef jerky (great cuts of beef, very little fat, tasty dipping sauce); curry puffs (not greasy at all, delicious sauce, I think we got 5-6 in our order which was more than we could eat.)  Salad - green papaya salad with shrimp. It's a standard. Perhaps a bit pricey for what you get but good flavor.  Mains - one penang curry with shrimp and one pad see ew. Both were good. I've found a lot of restaurants have oily pad see ew but this wasn't the case with ours. Penang curry was flavorful and had lots of shrimp.  Overall, quite pleased! We did take out but will gladly come again and dine in the restaurant.",

    "text": "This was my second time at Gaati Thai Kitchen. I tried the prix fix menu the first time and the value and quality was as good as Thai gets! This time I had a full on entree. Gratiene Chicken, medium heat. It was like a dish right out of Anthony Bourdains best of Thailand. The presentation was bright, fresh and was quintesential Thai! With the accompanying Chili and hot sauces, I turned up the heat to perfection. The owner personally visits each table and is cheerful and fun to talk to. She surprised me when I left and made me a delicious Thai Tea to go. Beat anything Starbucks makes by a country mile. Intimate but not over the top atmosphere, modern and spotless. Service very prompt and attentive. Will go back soon.",

My wife had the spicy mint chicken and I had red chicken curry. Having spent months in Thailand, the flavors at Gaati are authentic and I share others opinions about prices. All in all, I recommend Gaati for genuine Thai cuisine, even though it's 20% higher in price. But other Thai restaurants don't match the flavors at Gaati. We'll return for another round and let you know.",

The authenticity of this Thai restaurant is quite apparent.   Have dined in three times and once for carry-out:  have enjoyed the Pad Thai, Volcano chicken, green curry, crunchy rice salad, laab, yellow curry, crunchy chicken, treasure dumplings (OMG so good). Everything was superb!  Next I'll try the crunchy catfish  recommended by a friend.   Try dining in for lunch they have a special starter and entree for $9. Quite the deal.   Great for trying new items.  Tom yum was yummo as was the chicken mint!    Will be a repeat customer with high recommendations to others. One last note-the wine selection is well thought out. I recommend the block-9 (Pinot).",

He normally gets the \"Thai Spicy\" from Pinkaow, which is just above their 10 level but said Gaatis medium was just as hot if not hotter. For a medium spice level, it was way too hot.\"  Pinkaow actually underspices in my opinion. They are scared you will send it back because it will be too spicy. In fact no matter how many times I have asked them for thai spicy they always give me medium.   And yes you are correct, Thai Spicy at Gaati is very spicy, but very good.",
