    "text": "My wife found this hidden gem from reading all the good reviews from fellow Yelpers. So thank you!! Have been looking for a good southern food establishment. This restaurant fits the bill.  Took my Dad here a couple of weeks ago for his birthday breakfast. Located in West Las Vegas on Stella Lake just west of MLK. It's located in a small building right next to the police substation. Located in a nice new building, it is quite small inside, maybe 6 tables, mostly 2 tops and a couple larger 4 top tables. No problem. As good as the food was i would of sat on the floor or out on the grass to eat.   First of all this place smells amazing. I knew we were in for a treat. Finally found food just as good as when I lived in Mississippi. My Dad ordered the mix and match. you pick 2 meats, 2 sides and choice of bread. He chose the chicken wings, catfish, along with grits, potatoes, and toast. Just a shout out to the Catfish. It was hot, moist, delicious flavor and one of the best crusted coating batters i have ever had. Southerners everywhere would be proud. Grits were creamy and cooked perfect. Awesome all the way around.  I ordered the chicken and waffles. Really was looking forward to trying this, and I was not dissapointed. You get 4 large chicken wings. They were seasoned perfectly, and piping hot. So hot in fact it stayed that was the entire meal. It just would'nt cool down. lol. The waffle was delicious, light and fluffy. Pour the maple syrup on everything and it was southern hospitality on a plate. Really Really Good!!  Breakfast is served all day. A lot of the plates are named after southern states. Such as the Arkansas. Country Chicken fried steak and gravy. The Virginia. Grilled ham steak. All plates are served with 2 eggs, grits or potatoes and bread, muffin or biscuit.  Overall a great place to get your Southern Fix on. Friendly service, great Southern food, large portions, and good prices. Give it a try!!",

    "text": "Really...?! I've been here twice and I can't really say any of the food knocked my socks off. I've ordered the grits bowl and po-boy with catfish. Grits bowl is pretty straight forward grits, sausage, eggs, and cheese. I've only had plain homemade grits grits in the past and this dish didn't exactly impress me. I wanted to give them a second chance since all their reviews are pretty good on Yelp, plus my co-workers talk about how good the sandwiches are. My second visit I order the po-boy with catfish which good, but it was a small considering the price is $8.50. It had lettuce, tomato and some type of sauce, the sauce added the extra pazaze to it. The size should of been bigger or at least add more catfish in there. I think the prices here are $2 or $3 more than what they really should be. This is the closest restaurant to my work, but I probably won't be back. The chicken and waffles looks good, if I'm really craving it, I might be back for that, but once again they are overpriced because it's $10.95, really?! $11 for chicken and waffles, that's pretty expensive considering how cheap it is to make a waffle and they use chicken wings, not even the better parts of the chicken.",

The restaurant itself is tiny! Maybe 10 tables max? And only two tables outside. On a Saturday morning my husband and I were huddled in a corner waiting for our food debating if we should eat in the car! But it was definitely worth the wait.  Catfish- amazing! Finally found a place that makes it like Catfish Alley (so sad that they closed!) Breaded with cornmeal and perfectly crispy. A little strange to have it for breakfast but I wasn't going to complain.  Gritz? What are gritz? Never had them before and not sure how they're supposed to taste... but I finished the whole bowl. They were delicious. Good flavor and had the consistency of a thick cream of wheat. Add cheese and bacon and you'll be in heaven.   Overall: everything is made to order and comes out amazingly fresh and delicious. Very small restaurant so maybe order togo if you don't have a table.",

The menus are on a wall as you stand in line, that was by the time you get to the front you can give your order to the cashiers, who were very nice by the way. I ordered the Big Gritz Breakfast and it was amazing! The grits were cooked and salted just right, it came with eggs a waffle and your choice of fried fish or chicken. I chose the fish and it was crispy but not over cooked. The only thing I didn't like was, after our food was brought out to us we had to ask for utensils and napkins. The server took hot sauce, syrup and ketchup from a table next to us, who's party just left, which was okay, until right after we used it she took it from us to give to the table behind us. Like, really? She even took the salt and pepper from us to give to someone else. It's obvious that this restaurant has grown in the amount of time that it's been open. I see a bigger building and tables in the near future and I'm excited to see it grow into a reputable restaurant. I will be coming back for sure. If your in Vegas you should def check it out!",

It's a small restaurant so seating is limited and you have to order your food before sitting at a table. I want disappointed at all. Glad I got there when I did because by time I left the line was out the door. It was so good I sent twice during my visit. The chicken and waffles was great and it was whole wings whick too many places don't do. Will definitely go back on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

It was a light batter mixture cooked through and through, until it was a dark golden brown, and oh how it soaked up the butter and syrup!  Had chicken fried steak with a breading that was actually crispy, and the gravy was perfect.  Seriously, top notch place!",

I did see them kick a couple of people of people out of their seats because they were holding tables while there were others who had already placed their order. The lady was really nice about asking her to allow the other people to sit down.   They can use a large menu so that it can be viewed while your standing in line.",

I think most people take the food to go.  We ended up sharing a table (by choice, not because we were forced to or anything) with a lovely couple and their adorable daughter.  The food is so so delicious.  My boyfriend declared that the grits are some of the best he's had since moving to the southwest.  Not being from the South, grits aren't really my thing, but everything else was absolutely delicious.  Everyone is really friendly, and it seemed like a lot of the business was made up of repeat customers.  I definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be going back!",

The chicken was very good while unfortunately there was nothing spectacular about the waffle. We also had the \"Rich Boy\" which consisted of a generous amount of lightly battered shrimp on a hoagie with lettuce/tomato and their special sauce and this to my friends was so flavorsome!  I came here by a friend's recommendation to try their catfish and too bad we did not get to try it as we always over order so stay tuned cause we'll be back.  Can't WAIT!!!!

The best part of my meal was the grits and bacon, the grits were creamy and really good. We were given 4 slices of bacon that was not to thin, more like \"medium thick\", which was good too, but, the good part stops here as everything else our family ordered was subpar. We ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, the eggs were somewhat scorched and seemed as if they were cracked, and dumped in a skilled without scrambling in a bowl 1st. So they were hard and choppy.  I'm a waffle lover and I've had some really good malted waffles. Gritz' waffle wasnt crispy as most of the reviews were raving over, my waffle was thin,  which I dont mind, but it was undone making it sort of heavy. I havent figured out yet how they made a thin waffle and not cook it throughly. This waffle wasnt fluffy or flavorful at all. The fried chicken was super \"flavorless\", I didn't taste a sprinkle of seasoning, black pepper, or any kind of powder on that chicken wing! Those 4 wings was a waste of bird and its feathers, since they didnt pluck the hairs before frying. The home potatoes had a little flavor, not the best but ok. Its safe to say my 3 stars are based on the grtiz, bacon & customer service.",

No need for me to visit family in the ATL and NOLA to get good gritz. Only downside disposable plates and utinsels.  I wish they were a little more eco-friendly.  Super small interior. I counted 9 tables total of 28 chairs so come early if you want to have a seat. Otherwise, absoutely PERFECT if you just want to grab and go.  ENJOY",

Today I ate their chicken and waffles with (the best) Gritz bites. The chicken is sooo juicy and not too heavy, great breading and crunch. All food was piping hot when we got it! Everything is made fresh to order but waiting a couple minutes for it isn't a problem at all. The Gritz bites have great flavor alone but are good with syrup, or my favorite, hot sauce. The southern hospitality here is amazing and you always feel welcome and taken care of. Thanks guys for a full tummy and thoughtful service every time!",

    "text": "I first came here in 2013 at the recommendation of an old lady who helped me at the local post office as I prepared to go overseas for a few years. Upon coming back to Las Vegas for vacation, I really wanted to see if this place was as good as I remember from 3-4 years ago. It was.  This is an African-American owned establishment that excels in very good savory cuisine. I absolutely LOVE chicken and waffles and have had them at Roscoe's in LA and Harlem at multiple joints, and this place hands down is better.  Since I stay on the new strip for vacation, it is about a $6-10 UBER to get here but well worth it.  They have ample parking if you have a car on your vacation, so that saves you on the taxi fare.   The establishment is decently sized, as you come in there is a trash can to your right and clean bathrooms for men and women behind a partition wall. As you look ahead from the entrance you see the counter where a nice person always greets you. 3-4 years ago it was a elderly lady, this time it was a younger lady, both were amazingly nice. You order at the counter and grab a seat. Unfortunately, their Credit Card machine does not allow you to leave a tip, so if you intend to use card, I recommend bringing some cash to drop in the tip jar.  There are about 5-8 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables in the joint but I would not call the seating area huge. Your orders are made from scratch so expect to wait about 15-20 minutes for them to get your order together. As I said above, I love chicken and waffles so I always get it with the wife. It runs about $11 an order, you get 4 giant wings (flat & leg) with a waffle. With 2 drinks and a side order of a red hot, the bill came out to $33 after taxes.   The food as always comes out hot, to order and amazing. The hot sauce goes perfect with the nice crispy hot wings. I will be back again in the future as long as this place stays open. While we were eating about 10 other couples rolled through so it is really popular.  Just realize they close at 3pm, so make sure you plan accordingly if you intend to stop by.",

Went in and everyone was sweet and kind, so customer service was perfect. Ordered the waffle and chicken with the side of gritz, a Sweet Tea and peach cobbler. Got the peach cobbler first which by the way was Awesome! Then received their sweet tea which wasn't sweet at all. The food came afterwards. The waffle was dry with barely flavor and small. The chicken was a small piece of breast and that's it. Was dry also and barely any flavor. Was disappointed honestly and definitely wont come again. Sorry guys.",

When I finally called it to the host attention I was informed that they gave my plate to some one at table  number 33 ok so they say it will be out in a second and I was offered peach cobbler. After another 10 minutes of waiting and half of the food being cold I asked for a percentage off for the inconvenience and was told that's what the pie was for. I felt but we still waited 45 minutes So pie wasn't satisfying. Wewere supposed to be compensated $5 which never came back to my card, and decided not to stay and eat and when we got a few blocks away realized that they still didn't get the order right so we still had to drive back. And there was no apology or remorse.   Food wasn't even good waffles were super thin lol  GO TO LOLOS INSTEAD!!! Better service food and environment",

Wings were quite juicy. Breading wasn't too. thick. Next time I come, I might get catfish and waffles cuz they liked pretty good too. Note: One order of chicken and waffles comes with four large wings which was more than enough for this chubster. Glad Daniel was there to split it with me and catch my good side.   The seating area is small and it was crowded  initially but the turn-around is quick so we didn't wait that long at all to order and get a for a table for two. (Order first, then seat yourself) Service was good. Shouts to Nu-nu for being so nice.",

It gives me the perfect fix when I'm craving Roscoes and I don't wanna drive to Cali.   Their grits are really yummy as well. They have the best consistency to them and are perfect. I love getting scrambled eggs and mixing them in with a bit of salt and pepper.   It is a small cafe, only has maybe 10 tables or less and they close early at 3 pm I believe.

We had pretty much decided we would have to get the meal to go because it's a small place. When asked if we would eat here - we took one last glance at the sitting area and said \"To go\".   He told us - you're the next in line and you WILL get the next table. True to their word - that's exactly what happened!  The young lady who seated us was attentive, cheery and very pleasant.  The grits were absolutely perfect!  We got the chicken (2) and waffles which was a perfect portion. If you are going to come here, get here early.

Waffles weren't anything to write home to mama about but they were good. Fried chicken was perfect!   We had so much chicken that my daughter and I, ended up taking several pieces home. I popped them in the oven about 5 days later and they were still crispy and delicious.   We will return to patron this business and to get some more of that yummy fried chicken!  We got there right on time because it was a little empty and we had tables to choose from but that didn't last long. It's really small in their but it doesn't stop folks from coming in and ordering themselves some chicken.   They only take cash so come with some paper.",

I heard about this place a couple of weeks, and being from the South, I know and love good grits - so I was excited to try it, and willing to drive across town to do so.  We arrived Sat morning, and had a fun conversation with the lady (she was wonderful) at the register (you order and pay first).  She said these would be the best I've had.  But I never found out. I ordered biscuits and gravy with grits, but I never got my grits (the biscuits and gravy were okay).  I went back and stood at the counter, and after a couple of minutes I got the server's attention and told her they missed the grits on my order.  She said okay, turned around and went about her business.  I waited, and waited, and finished everything else I had, and waited a little longer. Never got my grits.",

My girlfriend and I were vacationing at the Hard Rock we wanted to get some really good breakfast and for whatever reason I woke up wanting Chicken and Waffles. We googled a few places and this place had the most amount of stars and wasn't that far away from the hotel. The pictures online weren't bad neither.  Entering the restaurant I almost about faced because it was so small and reminded me of the hood restaurants in Brooklyn. Idk if me and my GF looked like tourists or what so I didn't really want to chance it. Lol  However I was quickly greeted by friends faces and warm smiles. I felt immediately comfortable and relaxed. It didn't take long for our food to come but everyone made sure we were ok multiple times while we waited.  Even the owner of the place was pleasant. We loved that place so much we even tipped $5! Now idk if that's a lot in Vegas but in NY you have to really be doing something for me to up a $5 tip. Lol  Great job guys! If you're visiting Vegas you HAVE TO stop by this place! It's a must!",

Mount Moriah Dr is to the left (same street different name; Vegas be crazy like that, lol). Any who, Gritz Cafe is modest restaurant with dine-in or take-out options.  The cashier and wait staff were pleasant and quick. The prices are pretty awesome and you get nice sized portions. I had a State Plate, The Mississippi. So much food I was able to take some home for lunch.  Visit Gritz Cafe, you won't be disappointed!",

My daughter , my fiance and myself walked in , placed our orders and were able to find a seat just in the nick of time ! There's not much seating inside , but this isn't a bad thing , especially if you're okay with waiting around for a few mins for a current party to finish up and leave . A lot of people ignored the sign up front that clearly says \"place your order BEFORE being seated\" but it's okay .  The food was amazing . I ordered the mix and match meal for about $11.50 . I chose catfish and hot link as my meat , Mac and cheese and yams as my sides and cornbread as my bread . Oh man . Definitely the best soul food I've had since moving here to Las Vegas about 4 years ago . The portions were amazing , the catfish was FRESH and fried perfectly , not hard ! The sides were fresh and so tasty ! This place isn't close to home but I'll be stopping in EVERY chance I get . Thank you for the wonderful service !",

I got a grits bowl.  I chose the three slices of bacon and I got cheddar cheese on the top.  I asked for the egg sunny side up.  It also came with a choice of toast or biscuit and I got whole wheat toast.    I left the counter carrying my coffee cup and within a relatively short time, a young woman brought my breakfast to me.  Wow, was it good!  Break the yolk, and let it run into the grits along with the butter I had already put in.  Wonderful.  The restaurant is small--nine tables.  There was a couple with two small children at the other table--I hit a quiet morning--and they were visiting from California.  That's the kind of homey atmosphere the place has.  Adam, the young man taking orders today, was a very pleasant guy!   This is stick to your ribs down home cooking.  What that means is that breakfast was heavy laden with carbs so I'll have to do extra at my gym workout this afternoon.  Oh the horror, but it was so worth it.  Thanks to Sylvia and Nelson Q. for their heads up on this great place.",

Waffle: flavor excellent; but mine was cold and a bit hard likely from sitting in a holding-oven, but i'd give it another shot one day. It's in a nicely seculded area and there is a police station next door. Plenty of free parking if you're visiting from the strip; It's not that far of a drive. Prices are great!  The Bad: When you walk in, you are not seated. You will have to stand in line to order first, then seat yourself. I've heard it can be slow, but I think my \"tip\" got our food a bit faster when I ordered :-).  The Ugly: The facility is EXTREMELY small. I would say no more than 12 small tables are in there. So, grab a menu from the front counter, figure out what you want, and if you're dining in, send a drone from your party to grab a table while you're in line. I noticed a lot of people take-out.  Can't wait to go back!  Yelp yourself!",

Another disclaimer is that they cook to order and I can't be mad at that. The seating was very limited and it's first come, first gets the next open seat....if you're lucky. We had a party of 4 and we lucked out with the outdoor seating as a family was leaving right when our food came out. Otherwise we had planned to eat in the car. The food was very good. We all ordered chicken and waffles & I got a side of grits. The chicken which consisted of 4 whole wings were seasoned well & hot when served. The waffle was ok. Nothing major stood out except it was a full 4 quarter waffle. The service was great. Although there was a line, our order was taken so that it could be worked on while I stood in line to pay. The staff was very friendly & very accommodating when we sat down to eat. They made sure our tables were cleaned off & continued to check on us. And one waiter took a group pic upon our request before we left.  Oh and the grits were cooked just right.  Everyone wanted some after they saw mine, but that would require the need to stand in line again.  No thank you.",

Everything was delicious! My hesitation for 5 stars is totally based on service. Gritz is totally busy- so calling in the order took a certain level of commitment.",

    "text": "Wifey received a tip from a co-worker on this place, so we thought of giving this place a try instead of stopping at Mario's for our Catfish/Turkey Neck fix which is close by.  This is a really tight spot filled with two and four tops, so coming here with five or more people will probably end up in a longer wait than usual. We split the Big Breakfast of Chicken(or your choice of Fried Catfish) and Waffles, two eggs, and grits(first grits topping is free) and we also split The Rich Boy(AKA Shrimp Po' Boy) which came with 8 crisp, juicy shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and their special sauce on a toasted hoagie roll.  The chicken was good(all chicken wings) but I still like the fried chicken from Kathy's and the waffle was so-so. I have yet to find a good place in Vegas that has solid chicken and waffles(still have to try Skinnyfats' version) but the Rich Boy was very delicious and I'd return for that sandwich again.   Give Gritz Cafe a go, and see if its good enough to slap yo' momma!    ALOHA!!!",

The greens had a smoky flavor but weren't really seasoned.   Whatever you do, stay AWAY from the cornbread!! It was NOT good. It tasted like uncooked, unseasoned corn meal. Yuck!

I had fried catfish and greens, my partner had wings and waffles with fries, we both had iced tea to drink. The catfish was tender although some pieces were a bit thin. Greens were fantastic, with bits of ham. You could really taste the flavor of the ham cooked in. The wings were great, not greasy, tender and juicy. Service was good even though they were busy.  A couple of reviews mentioned the neighborhood. There's nothing wrong with the neighborhood. It's off a main street (MLK)and in a bit of an office/industrial area, not residential. No reason to feel unsafe at all. I'll hit this place again on when I'm in Vegas.",

I'm really picky when it comes to soul food. Man, this place did NOT disappoint.   It's a very casual joint and your food is served on plastic plates with plastic utensils. The staff was polite and very attentive.   I ordered chicken and waffles and a side of cheese grits. My friend ordered the mix and match which included two wings, two pieces of catfish, and eggs and instead of toast a waffle.   This mess was beyond delicious. The chicken and waffles came with FOUR CHICKEN WINGS. FOUR!!!! Four chicken wings and a waffle for 12 bucks. These chicken wings weren't rinky dinky either. The flavor was sooo good. The waffle was just okay. There's nothing like a Roscoe's waffle. I nibbled on my friends catfish and it was so good. Reminded me of my grandmas.  Now, you can't go to a restaurant named GRITZ and not try the grits. They were delicious! The perfect smooth consistency, no lumps no grains...just cream buttery goodness. I had cheddar cheese added to my grits and I thought I was gonna explode from eating too much goodness. Well I go back? Damn right. **drops mic** lol",

I ordered the \"Obama Special\" (that's what they call it at Roscoes in LA) which is chicken and waffles.. the food was good HOWEVER the girl at the counter told me one price and when I looked at my receipt it was another price, as I dissected my receipt I noticed after she told me the total she took it upon herself to add a tip and after my sister ordered I noticed she did it to her receipt as well... NEXT TIME YOU ORDER HERE CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS ...  granted the tip was only $.50 however you don't do that without consent boo, I could've wanted to give more out of support and most times when you give ppl the option they'll put at least $1 tip.. upon me bringing it to her attention She told ME, it's Ok... wait huh?! What's ok? You adding 50 cents extra to my bill for yourself???? I didn't make a big deal because I rather bring it to yelp so that everyone is aware and can carefully assess their receipts.. That was so ratchet and not a good look for an up and coming black business ( I say up and coming because, I know they workin hard to get a bigger facility to seat all their guests)... whoever the owner is, I know you want to give our ppl a chance but lay down some ground rules and don't make it so laxed at your place to where your employees feel comfortable with doing and acting as they feel... It sucks really because it gives us all a bad rep smdh ... 2 stars for the 2 quarters taken from my acct... it could've been more had I been given the option to leave my own tip ",

We both agreed that the grits were absolutely phenomenal. We know and love grits. I had my with cheese and it was so good. It was creamy and just right. So A+ for the grits.  The chicken was seasoned well. So well that even my \"to-go\" several hours later was still tasty. The fish was piping hot and my boyfriend vacuumed that all up. LOL! He was literally inhaling his meal.  I would say my only disappointment was the waffle. It was a little overcooked and I didn't enjoy as much as my other food.

Next we ordered the \"Mississippi\" Fried Catfish with Mac & Cheese and Yams this was not so good (would not order again) the Catfish was under cooked and the Mac & Cheese and Yams were served room temperature. The Coffee was good; however their signature \"Muddy Water\" (Ice tea/ Lemonade mix) lacked flavor and sweetness. Also our meal was $38 and we were charged a .50 cent fee to use a credit card, which appear on the bill as a tip. We also left an additional tip. So if your wondering why we gave this restaurant 3 ; We really loved the hospitality and it's all in the name we should've stuck to just Grits for an entree.",

Take your food to go as it is a very small restaurant with a line that is usually out the door ( that should tell you how good the food is) I would recommend the catfish and chicken combo plate",

When we arrived the establishment is almost full of patrons, you order first and pay and get your seats while they deliver the food to your table when it has been cooked.  My sister who visited from San Diego is the one who told is about this place and naturally, we came here to give her what she wanted. It was a trip worth made! The food was made fresh and hot and the flavors of our dishes were all very savory. We were cared for very well by the staff.  This place is well and highly recommend by me to anyone who love Soul food. Two thumbs up!",

I must say she is doing better than some other soul food and I will not name them. She actually gives you 4 pieces. I wish I would've had two pieces of toast rather than one cut in half. Basically $20.00 per person we had the exact same thing but my mom had croissants instead of toast. That made it a little more expensive and two bottles of water. Over all I most definitely will return and I recommend. I'm a born and raised southern belle and I know grits. Add a little buttermilk and a spoon of cream cheese stir and keep check and I promise you'll never have issues. And cook longer than the bag says please.. parking was a little tight but it was homey.",

Fish flakey and the chicken was hot and crispy.  My complains are the waffle was way too thin and hard. Even my year and a half old grandson, who we got it for, didn't like it. Add more batter to the griddle or use a different brand of mix.  We heard a lot of comments about them needing a bigger spot. My daughter who is a small business owner doesn't agree. A lot of small businesses fail when they try to expand.  I suggest doing what we're are going to do the next time we come to Vegas, order a head and get it to go. There are some nice parks in the area. We ended up getting our order to go & had a picnic.",

    "text": "Dare I say this place is better than Roscoe's?... I swear it's almost identical but the reason is is arguably better is because of the freshness. Every time I've gone the food comes out piping hot. Literally too hot to eat. I have to give it 5 or so minutes so I don't burn my hands and mouth. The chicken is in more generous portions as well. It's very small and modest inside but they still have a medium size menu. Other items are also tasty and they have the tea/cool-aid/orange juice combos but the main reason to go is the incredible chicken and waffles",

The place is small so I can't imagine what it's like during their peak hours. We were welcomed by two very polite ladies at the cash register. You order your meal first and then seat yourself. I ordered the Mix n Match which came with 2 chicken wings, 2 pieces of catfish, cheese grits, mac n cheese and cornbread. Wow! Absolutely delicious!!! The food was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The service was amazing. And after I ate my meal, I bought a piece of lemon cake to go which was amazing as well. I'll definitely visit this place again because there's a lot of food on the menu that I can't wait to try.",

There's not much Soul Food out west.  I took one step in Gritz Cafe and was instantly transported back home.  The people were friendly and the food smelled good.  This place is small but efficient.  Its the kind of place that you order at the counter then find a seat.  We were greeted with a smile and all questions about the menu were answered even thought the place was pretty busy.  I ordered the combo breakfast that included eggs, fried fish, grits and a waffle.  It had all flavor of my mom's home cooking.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the grits were awesome.  The service was excellent and the staff was attentive. Even the bathroom was super clean.  Bottom line is, if you want some good southern food, this is the place to go.  I can't wait to tell others about this place and return again.",

First bite, deep fried grease drippin down your chin...you get the idea.  Thankfully, Gritz Cafe is different...in a GREAT way!  Chicken & Waffles ($10.95). Gotta be some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had! So much flavor...so juicy...and everything tastes great with Maple syrup poured on it!  Batter has spices and flavor hiding inside, with a nice slightly crispy-crunchy consistency.  Waffle was good, not mind blowing good, but combining it with the chicken takes it up to another level!  Pretty basic waffle, but the chicken is where it's at!  I plan to be back to try the Catfish!  That's actually what I came here for initially, but breakfast moods swayed me!    Too bad they close so early...3pm!  But then again, I don't see myself coming here by myself at 10pm either LOL  Come get some!",

This particular morning wasn't going so well my intentions were to go to LoLos Chicken and Waffles but this Thursday morning they didn't open until 11. Went to yelp and to my surprise Gritz Cafe was the first thing that popped up . Walked in got an amazing greeting The customer service was on point . The cashier/server recommended great menu items Both of which I always purchase other places she sold me on The Gritz Bowl with the grilled shrimp and the also Chicken and Waffles. Our ticket number was 27 and we ordered at 930. We sat down a family that purchased their food before us got there food mighty quickly so we assumed we were next.Untill people that came in behind us start getting their food  . I noticed the table behind us got their food which was the same exact thing that I ordered . There were also guest number 33 . I asked the server if 27 was ready she said it was in the window ready  to go 15 mins later we heard them yell out number 38 I got annoyed.  So I asked the server again was the food ready she said yes and said that a the previous server gave away my order to another guest . At this point I'm over it they offer to give me lemon cake that I don't eat the younger queen with the curly hair offers peach cobbler .. Our first server did come over and explain what happened  until after 30 minutes later .Also said she hoped it didn't ruin our experience . We waited another 15 mins  more for my Gritz Bowl and Catfish fillet that I wanted a refund . The younger queen made it a point to say we gave you a peach cobbler  and your food is done .  Instead of requesting the hole meal for free because at this point it's 1015 and I'm ready to go my food still wasn't done  I was waiting for the side croissant . The original queen that helped us said she could give us the refund of 5$ I grabbed my bag and walked out the door .. now I didn't check the bag to see if everything was there . I wish I would've because my catfish was still missing . I was already on  lake mead and Losse by the time I noticed it I drove back  asked a hole different server about it because neither one of the queens said anything  to me when I walked in the door . . The younger queen said o your missing a fillet and gave me someone else's to get me out of the door . By the time I got home the grits tasted over cooked and I didn't even eat the meal .. Needles to say I would never go back . Not because of the mistakes but  because how the handle the situation  when they found out there was an issue I've been in food service for years and am a Supervisor  for a restaurant . My staff would've re spoke to the customers to let them know they realized the situation and what the solution is and had the kitchec refire the food immediately.I know others that would've went ape .. Please next time do better you would've got a pass if the food was on point like Queen said it was .. and I'm sure will be for oth",

Very unprofessional. There were a few tables that only had two or three people seated. Your food was awesome, but the hospitality of one of hostesses was terrible. Even after we informed her that we had already ordered food in accordance with the restaurants policy. It would be hard for me personally to recommend the Gritz restaurant to my friends or family.",

    "text": "Very good food...I came here on an early Saturday afternoon with expectations to be waiting forever and the wait was not that bad. I've honestly waited far longer for food. The inside is pretty cramped and you have to keep an eye out in order to find a seat. However, because it was just me and one other person, we were able to snag a small, two seat table before our food came out.  I ordered the mix and match which comes with choice of two meats, two sides and a bread. I chose chicken wings, catfish, cheese eggs, grits and a biscuit. And, being the gluttonous person that I am, I also ordered a waffle because I really wanted one! I am glad that I did, because it was my favorite part of the meal. It is was slightly crispy but yet soft and it had a great taste. My only small gripe was the syrup wasn't high quality, but I am a little dramatic when it comes to syrup. Either way, the waffle was still bomb. So, after I crushed over the waffle for a while, I got to my main entree and it was delicious. The grits were perfect. In case you didn't know, grits are a science, but they got it right. The fish and chicken was crispy and flavorful and the eggs were perfect. No extra charge for cheese! Score. Unfortunately, I was overambitious and was full before I was even halfway through, but it was so worth it. The leftovers weren't as good, sadly, but I also didn't have anything to heat them up. So, don't let that stop you from munching on yours throughout the day, because it is likely you will have leftovers.  There was an awkward moment when, who I assume was a manager, became irritated with the cashier. I felt a tad bad for the lady because she was doing her best to keep the line moving and I didn't like how she made these comments in front of customers.  Anyway, I will definitely visit Gritz when I am back in Vegas. It is great food for reasonable prices and it is a pretty cheap Uber or Lyft ride from the strip, if you are from out of town. And, it is a relief from some of the other food options in the surrounding area.",

Place was recommended by a family member so we tried it. As we were in line to order a table became available so my husband went to sit down. Young man approaches him after 5 minutes and says he has to get up because he didn't have a receipt.  Their rule which I can respect if it applies to everyone. Luckily we were able to get said seat after I ordered, however as we waited for our food several individuals came in giving hugs to workers and were allowed to sit prior to ordering prior to their entire party being present and it didn't set well with me for this reason I was unable to enjoy my experience. Which I was excited about. Customer service is everything and if you have rules make them apply to everyone and not people traveling from miles away to support your business. Should you eat here yes but get your food to go. So yeah I'm disappointed by the lack of professionalism we experienced trying to support our black owned businesses.",

I recommend that you head out here if you're craving a mean bowl of grits and an even meaner Chicken & Waffles.  Gritz Cafe does it right.  Gritz Cafe does it good.     The Food: I had their Big Gritz Breakfast.  This meal consisted of their 5 pieces of fried chicken, waffles, 2 eggs, and a cup of grits.  Cost is about $15 and you get a lot. The grits was thick and creamy, which is exactly how I prefer it.  As for the chicken & waffles, it was delicious.  The fried chicken wings is perfectly seasoned and breaded.   The Service: 5 Stars for their service. Emma was awesome.  She made sure that we were comfortable and even moved us to another table with more room.   The Establishment: The restaurant is small, and it's busy. Tables are also first come, first serve.  My suggestion is to come early or call in your order.  There's also seating outside and It's called the sidewalk.     Tips:   -The food comes out hot.  Take your time or you'll burn your mouth.  -Located off Lake Mead and MLK.    2016 Yelp Review #13",

The line was long and after 15 minutes of ordering our food my girlfriends and I finally sat down at the corner table. The table seated up to four but there were only two chairs and better believe we shared those chairs because it took another half hour for us to get our food. By the time we got our food two more chairs became available. I ordered the simplest meal on the menu: Grits, an egg over medium and twelve shrimps half grilled and the other half fried. I explained to our server that I was missing six shrimps. She then said no you only ordered six, she then brings my receipt and it CLEARLY showed I ordered twelve. So by this time I ate half the bowl thinking I'm going to get the rest of my shrimps but nah.. my girlfriend went up to ask for a to go box and about the remaining shrimps and then the cooks or whoever it was starts tripping saying the order was right. I didn't get a refund, apology or my six shrimps but they were quick to mess up my order and keep my money. I can't stand a business that sweats the food YOU already paid for and to top it off we paid 42$ for the Uber ride there and back to the strip.",

The greens weren't his favorite but I don't always trust his taste buds because he can be picky. I couldn't try them because there were seasoned with meat but looked good. I would definitely recommend this place but suggest a workout after to combat the hight fat content you're sure to get from enjoying such a meal. It comes with the territory, but is highly worth it!

    "text": "I wanted chicken and waffle in Las Vegas and goggle to find it, read a few reviews and decided to try it out. It is off the beaten path, only locals knows this place, as it is not that near the strip and nestled in residential area and some offices. Who knew that this place would have the best fried chicken and waffle. The batter on the chicken was very good, they ran out of whole chicken parts and used wings instead - no complain there. It was \"oh..so..good\"! Beside the chicken and waffles, we tried the chicken fried steak with gravy and finish off with a peach cobbler. Pricing is reasonable. I rather eat here than stand in the buffet line to eat mediocre food. Gritz cafe, you have my 110% vote!",

It is great going out of town and seeing a black owned restaurant, with good food and great service! Thank you so much and I wish you prosperity to remain a successful business that will expand :)!",

If you want to dine inside call ahead and see if there's a table ready.  You will be much happier than just showing up.",

Located just north west of the strip no more than 10 mins away, the restaurant is very clean but somewhat of a tight fit so seating is a bit limited. When you place your order you'll have to go to the counter and your food will be brought to the table. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and I have to say it was delicious. I love my food freshly prepared and served hot and at Gritz Cafe that's the only way they serve their dishes. Grits seem to be their specialty and you can just about order it with anything. The service was great and the severs were friendly. All in all it was a very good experience. The only thing that I could find wrong is that they use plastic ware  plates, forks and styrofoam cups a no no in the restaurant business. Still worthy of three stars.",

Growing up my mother made grits that were thick and creamy, in a sense like cream of wheat.  Well at Grits Cafe, the grits always have a thin film of water on top, and lack the creamy-ness I grew so fond of as a child.  So I usually order the home fries with catfish, and eggs.  Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.  If you go, I  promise you will like...",

Secondly, some tables were not very clean and the customers who were there alone were sitting at tables meant for parties of 2 or more.  Okay, now on to the food. The southern catfish, breakfast potatoes and scrambled eggs were pretty decent. The catfish was hot and crisp with a tender, flaky inside. The spouse had fried chicken wings, mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. I tried a piece of the chicken and it was also good. Mac and cheese was on point for a resteraunt.   As I stated at the beginning, the only knock on this place is location and seating space. I recommend ordering to go unless you enjoy rubbing elbows with other diners crowded in with you. My 4 stars are for the food.",

This food will make you believe in a God and that there's a devil that created diabetes, hyper-tension, and high blood pressure. To all that, I say, devil be gone! And enjoy this great tasting Southern cuisine.     I'm sorry Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, Brown Sugar in Oakland and all the other soul food places that I have tasted in my life THIS is the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. I'll go a step further, this was the best food that I have eaten in Vegas hands down!   The mac and cheese, grits, potatoes, biscuits and gravy are all top notch! Wow, wow, wow, its the type of food you want to come in hungry for, like have not had a meal in 6 hours type of meal.   Plus, the customer service is stellar and prices reasonable. The only thing is that it is busy! Either get there early or order to go because you may have to wait for a table if you eat inside because of the small dining area. Can't believe this is not 5 stars!!! 5 star cuisine all the way!",

I asked my daughter what she wanted for breakfast and she said fried chicken.  I didn't want to go anywhere on the strip so I found Gritz Cafe.  With the great reviews to the mouth watering pictures.    We came here around 8am on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded.  This place can probably hold up to 20 people.  The servers are very nice.  I wanted to order two Chicken and Waffles plate ($12) the cashier said that it will be too much food and $24.  So she recommended me to get 1 chicken and waffles plate and a waffle on the side ($3.50).  I'm so glad I took her recommendation,  the wings were HUGE, crispy and tasty.  The waffles were moist and flavorful.    I will definitely go here again for the great food and wonderful people.",

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time.  They serve fried chicken, waffles and grits... sinful, comfort food.  The reviews on yelp said the place is tiny, a bit slow (as they cook to order) and terribly busy on weekends.  For my visit, I came on a Tuesday at 11:15, right before a normal lunch rush.   When I walked in, I was relieved to see there were a few empty tables.  Yelpers weren't kidding. This place had 9 or 10 tables, and no where to really stand if you were waiting for food or a table.  There were a few tables outside, and fortunately it wasn't hot that day.  The staff greeted us, and handed us a menu.  I narrowed my choice to the Kentucky: wings + 2 sides, which I chose grits and yams.  An order of grits came with 1 topping, so I chose bacon... truly not a healthy meal, is it?  Stephen chose the Louisiana Hot Link sausage, eggs, and grits with bacon AND cheese (0.75 more for an extra topping).  He chose cornbread while I chose a biscuit.  The food took about 20 minutes, and while we waited, we were served our drinks. Sweet tea for me, diet coke for Stephen.  She even stopped to give us refills.  Top notch service.  The meal was delicious, and not overly greasy.  It didn't look like a lot of food, but it took a while for me to finish it... and I was truly full all day. Even when we had a late dinner at 9:30, I wasn't really that hungry.  I'll be back for more, but will visit only if it's mid-week.  The boss lady said if you come on weekends, show up at 7:00 am or be prepared to wait!",

    "text": "3.5 actually  I had this establishment in my saved  places whenever I was in Vegas again. So since I had enjoyed my 3 day taco fix we decided to have our final meal at Gritz. Little off the beaten path but the area and restaurant are nice and clean, ample parking, and reasonable prices. Indoor seating is another story pretty tight and limited but that was ok had a few hours left before flight we'd just get it to go. The service was pleasant and things initially appeared to be running smoothly although majority of the seated folks and those standing around were still waiting on food. Sister decided to try the hot link Omelette with a side of grits and I believe I had the Kentucky (2 wings, cornbread, w/2 sides Mac and cheese and yams, I also added collared greens). The grits were amazing, the omelette was pretty good average size, the yams and Mac and cheese were so good they alone would make you come back Chicken was good well prepared, cornbread was ok and the collard greens were edible but I wouldn't order again can't put my finger on it but a tad under seasoned (flavor wise)for my taste but they weren't tough. Oh the lemonade and fruit punch we're both good. The reason for the 3.5 and not 4 was the wait time it was ridiculous over an hour and it wasn't just us waiting, the system seemed off instead of orders being prepared in order it seemed to jump around and the order dispatcher seemed a bit overwhelmed. Overall I would most likely try again when in town to see if the service time has shortened and expansion of seating space was done, because I believe this place has 5 star potential.",

Chicken very crispy on the outside with good flavor juicy on the inside the Grits were great I'm not a great person but very creamy these people know what they're doing with bacon and cheese on top it was a hit. Macaroni and cheese was okay it was not authentic as I thought it would be very saucy not box but Velveeta I believe. Good flavor in the waffle the customer service was awesome. Just small if you are looking to sit down and eat there's only about 10 tables to do so and very close to each other it's it's best to order in and take it to go.",

In fact, there's a place a block away from Gritz Cafe that supposedly has good catfish and a group of Yelpers actually went a few months ago. I saw pictures of the place and decided it would be smart for me not to go even as a group. I'm glad to say that Gritz Cafe is a clean, safe place with good food.  They only have a few tables. The service was superb and absolutely friendly. The food was served fresh and hot. We got catfish with grits and mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles. Their sweet tea was less sweet compared to most places that serve sweet tea.  Catfish: Seasoned, battered in corn meal and fried to perfection. Put some hot sauce and it's perfect! I've had terrible catfish in the past and I was also raised to not eat catfish since \"it's a bottom feeder that eats garbage\" so for me to like this speaks highly of this place. 5/5  Chicken and Waffles: I'm a Roscoe's fan so I would have to compare their chicken and waffles with GC's. GC has 4 huge chicken wings. Roscoe's lets you choose what parts you want. BUT GC's fried chicken was just as delicious. Super hot (temperature-wise), crunchy and well-seasoned. As for the waffles...well, they were marginal. Nothing special...Roscoe's waffles are sooo much better. Even the guy at the next table thinks so! 3.5/5",

I had the Grits bowl with cheese, eggs scrambled, fried catfish, biscuit and with lots of butter. It was pure heaven. Cooked just right, warm and tasty. . Greeted as I walked in the door and checked on several times. Customer service was outstanding (thank you Cee Gee). I will be back and I have to try the chicken and waffles. I also tried the fried grits that they will be offering soon. It was yummy.",

Roscoe's has NOTHING on this place. This place will definitely be my go to spot whenever I come to Vegas!!!! Keep up the good work!!!!",

For the most part I always get the turkey sausage grits bowl and its awesome the sausage is juicy and the eggs cheese and grits is that perfect compliment although it can seem a bit pricey for the portion just 1 small patty just doesn't stretch through your bowl well.   But on the other hand service means everything to me and I have to say the people working there are so ungrateful when it comes to you giving them your hard earned money. I find the cashiers to always be smug and cold very brief and unapproachable. I think that they should be required to go through some sort of customer service skills review or course or maybe the owner should reevaluate who behind the register because the are the first impression to their business.",

We were handed a menu upon sitting down, after about 8 mins of sitting we were asked if we ready to order and we said yes and she did reply back saying \"OK\". Mind you we went offered anything drink prior or after her asking if we were ready. So we sat for another 5 min and she still haven't came back to take our order. If you don't already know this place is a very small dining, when I say small, I mean you can have a conversation from one side of the dining area to the other with a normal tone and hear everyone's conversation as if you are sitting at their table. Anyhow, the waitress/server turns around and goes past us to sit at another table and started rolling utensils. At this point I was fed up with service. So we just got up and excused ourselves out with a \"Thank You Have a great day!!\" I don't care how good the food has been said to be... but we will definitely not EVER be going back",

Her sandwich came out within 6 minutes but I waited 25 minutes for my meal. After the 20 minute mark I asked one of the workers if my order was coming up soon and she replied with a sarcastic \"no it's not\" and then cackled like that was funny.   When I finally received the wings I realized why it's called \"fowl.\" The chicken was dried and unseasoned. Eating them filled me with a sense of sorrow. I became depressed thinking multiple chickens sacrificed their appendages for this soulless food. I contemplated vegetarianism.

I got the grits bowl with a hot link and biscuit. He got the Alabama with thick cut bacon. The grits. Omg the grits. Absolutely nothing had to be added. Butter salt pepper, nothing. They were PERFECT. The biscuits were so soft and fluffy!! (My mouth is watering as I type) the hot link and bacon both surpassed expectations. walking in we were greeted warmly & asked if it was our first time.  We stated yes and were handed menus. Bc we went early around 8, only one table was taken. (The place is bigger inside that I thought after reading reviews so don't let that sway your opinion without going) We originally sat at the table for two Bc I knew from the reviews that they would fill up quickly and I didn't want us wasting a table for 4. We were approached and told to get a bigger table for elbow room! Lol Love it. The hospitality supersedes the food and that's saying a lot since the food is so good. Having the the talks with laughter with the workers and regular customers in the background while eating made the atmosphere so homey. & the music is bomb! My boyfriend had to tell me that I was singing along to every song while eating Bc I didn't even notice. Haha We will definitely make going the Gritz a weekly thing! As we were leaving we were told that they get busy around ten so try to make it before then. They open at 7. I've had it bookmarked for months and I regret not going earlier since it's only 2 miles away from me!!! LOVE IT! GO NOW!! NOW!",

Lotta times folks talk about how Black business's can be...from my perspective ANY business can be mixed. From the young brother at the counter to the table service asking if we were good, Gritz deserves \"5 stars\"...which btw I never give to keep folks on their toes. This place deserves all of em!!",

A little pricey with the sides being $3 for the amount u get but the taste makes it worth it. Everyone is super nice. Seating is very limited tho as this place gets packed fast.",

One note of constructive criticism for the owners.....The young ladies that either were cleaning the tables or bringing the food to tables...well they were not the friendliest.

    "text": "Had very high expectations for this place.  Overall, it just was mediocre.  The service was plenty friendly and the people were polite.  Overall, it is as follows for my breakfast experience:  The good: - The prices were reasonable for the amount of food.  4 large wingsm a biscuit, a juice, some potatoes and grits were like $14. - The potatoes were tasty, with onions and green peppers in them. - The grits were creamy and smooth.  They have a variety of things you can mix into them.    The bad: - The food came out around 5 million degrees Celsius.  I want fresh and hot food, but daaaaamn, after 10 minutes sitting on my plate, a piece of fried chicken hit me in the face after I broke the wing, and it scalded me.  The food was HOT coming out.  Too hot for me.  I want to be able to eat within a few minutes. - The potatoes were mushy.  The breakfast potatoes, while tasty, were way overcooked.  They were pretty much mush. - The biscuit was the size of a silver dollar, and was hard as a rock.  Took 2 bites, but it was like hard drywall.  I am sure I just got a stale one, but still. - Minute maid or some other kind of concentrated orange juice.  I get not everyone is going to make fresh OJ, AND the juice here is very reasonably priced, since it is concentrate.  I mean, I think a big OJ is like $1.50 or something, which is fair for what it is.  I just would like some real juice. -Plastic silverware, paper plates and Styrofoam containers, even if you are eating in.  I don't know, but for me, eating out of plastic and Styrofoam affects the taste of the food, just like drinking Coke out of a glass bottle improves it. -The fried chicken was pretty \"meh\" for me.  It was not bad by any stretch, and I certainly would not have any issues eating it, but I would not seek it out and I was not blown away by it.  I was expecting some incredible bird after the reviews I read, but no so much.  Overall, it was a big let down for me, but was not horrific.  I would consider trying it again for lunch for a shrimp po' boy or something to see if it was good, but breakfast is pretty much done for me.  On an unrelated note, an eclectic mix of customers, from people in shirts and ties to people sporting various neck tattoos.",

    "text": "We decided to try out Gritz because of the IG posts. We arrived about 10:45 am and the first thing we noticed was the small interior and that there were no available seats. Now at best the inside has 10 tables and the lady at the register said they have outdoor seating so we were like \"alright.\" Initially the lack of seating had us trying to figure out where we would eat our food and if it was worth it to eat in the car or just go elsewhere. Now what the lady at the register failed to mention was outdoor eating consisted of ONLY 2 tables. One table was taken by a family of 5. Our party consisted of 3 people. We only had the option of an outdoor table with 2 chairs. Luckily after seating outside for a few a table inside became available and we were able to dine inside.   To order you must stand in line and once at the register provide your name and place your order. Once your food is ready it is brought to you. Since we didn't have a table my food could not be brought to me. When I approached to pick up my food the lady commented that I didn't have a table and where was I seating. Her tone rubbed me wrong it was as if she couldn't see they did not have an available table and that it was not my responsibility to bring my own table. I responded with we were told there is an outdoor seating area but unbeknownst to me the seating area was a joke. I do not understand how or why a person will invest in a restaurant with limited seating capacity.   Let's discuss the food. We had fish, chicken, yams, Mac n cheese, grits, eggs, lemon cake, cornbread, white bread, and rolls. To start off let's make mention that we are Southerners....from where you may ask? Oh, just the great state of Louisiana. So for a restaurant to refer to themselves as \"southern cooking\" and not live up to it is blasphemy. Just saying. Well one thing is evident, the kitchen does not stock seasoning and if they do the cook does not know how to use it which results in bland on top of bland wrapped in bland. Did I mention the food was shall I say, bland? My friend commented the best part of the meal was the fountain drink. I guess I should be happy that they did not have peach cobbler available. If you can't make good fried chicken and catfish you are not whipping up any award winning cobbler. My friend ordered the lemon cake as that was the only dessert available and she took one bite, stared down at the cake, closed it up and was through all together.   Now the food isn't awful but it is not good. It is not worth the price. We tried it but will not be back. Also the staff member that was responsible for ensuring the order was right when brought really must not have been paying attention. Three times my friends had to get up to ask for something they were suppose to get with their order and didn't from drinks to bread to the cake.   If you do not pay attention to anything else I say remember to BYOT [Bring your own Table].",

The food here reminded me of visiting family down South!  You know that family that makes sure you eat real, real GOOD?  I stuffed myself miserably. My thought process: \"I'm not really sure when I'll be heading this way again.  Let me go all out!\" The grits, the chicken & waffle, catfish...all very flavorful. Great sized portions. As it turns out, I am heading to Las Vegas this Saturday for the City Of Lights R&B Jazz Festival.  I may have to pay my \"cousins\" at GRITZ another visit...",

I strategized and called in a takeout order as I left the office, and swung in at 3:05 full of apologies. They do open early for weekend brunches though, and serve breakfast all day.  Ordered the Richboy- a poorboy with fried shrimp, lettuce and tomatoes, and special sauce. Comes with a side of either grits or fries, and I went with the former as they're the namesake of this restaurant- added American cheese. Other add-on options include bacon, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, jalapenos, egg, etc.- they def know variety with their grits. Total came to under $11.  Portion is enormous. 6\" hoagie doesn't look like a monster, but it's packed with 8 large fried shrimp and though my belly wasn't full after eating half, it was bursting at the seams after I forced myself to finish. Grits have great flavor and texture, and adding American cheese was delicious- would try with mushrooms and onions in the future, I've got my eye on the Grits Bowl for my next visit.",

    "text": "The b/f and I just had a fabulous Saturday breakfast here and I couldn't wait to review it.  Coming straight from the gym, we were both famished and ready to eat.  From the time we walked in the door, Emma, our waitress provided the friendliest customer service we've had in a long time.  She greeted us as we sat down, cleaned off the table that she noticed was a bit dirty, attempted to fix our wobbly table, and when that didn't work moved us to a table for four even though there were only the two of us.  After perusing the menu, customers order at the counter and then the food is brought out.  As others have stated, this is a small place, so we were lucky to snag a table right before 10:00am.  There was a steady line of customers when we were there, but several were to-go orders.   I had the fried chicken and waffles, which is a big waffle served with 4 fried chicken wings.  The fried chicken was piping hot, tasty, and not greasy at all.  Using my hands to dig in, this was not a neat meal by an means, but it was good.  Emma checked on us often as did the other waitress there.  If you are a fried chicken fan, I heartily recommend you bookmark Gritz Cafe for amazing food and service.",

    "text": "Wow this food was very tasty and filling!  The location is kind of small inside, not too much seating. There is a sign up front that says they charge $0.50 for using credit or debit card.  I got The Louisiana:  juicy hot links served with 2 sides, and bread (toast, English muffin, or biscuit).  I chose to get Macaroni & Cheese, Greens, and Cornbread, and a Sweet tea.  The sausage was really, really good. It's either the way they cooked them, or the sausages themselves, but they tasted like they were cooked over a wood grill or something. They were really, really delicious, and I would get them again. The cornbread was really good too. Out of the sides, the macaroni and cheese was ok, the cheese sauce was a little watery but the noodles were al dente which I like.  The greens were really good, with ham, kind of salty but I think supposed to be.  My husband got the Big Gritz Breakfast: Chicken or Fish, two eggs, grits and waffle. He chose the fried Chicken, and added Bacon, Onion and Cheese to his grits.  The eggs were cooked Over-medium.   The chicken was nicely fried, and there was a large portion. The waffle was good, a little on the thin side (not super fluffly) but tasted pretty good.   The gritz were really good and tasty, especially putting the egg in and mixing it around. The yolk was runny enough so the eggs were really cooked perfectly.    Overall we really enjoyed our food and the sweet tea.  I didn't feel too healthy after eating all this food but it was definitely delicious and enjoyable. Everyone was really nice and constantly asked if we needed anything.    The 2-seater round tables were kind of tiny, and we didn't have too much room for the utensils, plates of food, tray of sauces, and napkins, and drinks. The sweet tea is refillable and the ladies working there kept asking if we needed a refill which was nice!",

Tables and seating are a first come, first serve basis ( you seat yourselves. ) The cafe' itself is small and definitely a mom & pop joint, which are always my favorite. The staff was very friendly, but the prices were a bit high, but it was worth it. Home cooked breakfast for sure , the meals did not come with a beverage so be prepared to pay for that separately .  I ordered the Hot link combo that came with eggs of choice, side of choice and toast or cornbread . The Hotlinks were spicy and juicy, just the way I like them. I choose fried eggs, Grits(perfectly cooked and seasoned) and Cornbread( moist and sweet) 5/5 everything was very good and reminiscent to my grandmothers cooking . I can't wait to come back again!

It's the closest to \"real\" southern food you can get and not be in the south....Now it doesn't come close to getting the real thing in the south (I'm from the south) but pretty darn close.  I ordered the catfish with sides gritz and greens...and I ordered a shrimp Po Boy. It takes a while for your order (at least 20-30 min as it's made to order) a little on the expensive side but ALL of it was delicious! I mean really yummy...This was during the week.   I came back again on a Saturday and ordered catfish again...What a disappointment Lol! So to be clear it wasn't bad but of course they have different cooks. The catfish this day was almost bland...no where near the flavor as the other time I went BUT STILL GOOD.   So I guess it can be hit or miss. I wish I would have known that but I will pay attention to whose cooking next time I go and make sure I'm there when those cooks are there.  I'm definitely going back that's for sure...I say if you haven't been here GO you won't be disappointed!!",

They require you to place your order before getting a table and it's not that big with just a few tables.  We ordered fish, chicken, waffles, potatoes, grits and eggs and I can't explain how perfect everything was and I didn't expect to find this type of perfection in Vegas but was pleasantly surprised.

I had a grits bowl with bacon and shrimp and eggs and  cheese it was delicious.    We also had the catfish and Mac and cheese and yams.    The yams are so sweet and so good.   Almost melt in your mouth.    The only thing I can say that could be improved is that the grits were a bit salty.   Otherwise everything else was good.     The guy taking orders mentioned he was from My home town, so we both did a shout out to the city of pride and purpose.    Great spot for breakfast but be prepared to wait!",

THE SERVICE  my boyfriend complained a little about how long the food took.. in reality i.t doesn't take that long we as a society are used to our food coming out in 5 minutes due to mass production.. i had to remind him that each meal is made to order so of course i.t takes a while and YOU CANT RUSH PERFECTION!!! keep up the great work guys!!!",

It is right across the street from the local FBI office.  This is a pretty small restaurant and I'm told that the line is usually through the front door. Fortunately I beat the crowd on the day I went. It did start filling up after I finished.  The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. I had the two pieces of chicken & waffles with a side of grits. It was plenty of food and really satisfying.   At some places, it really seems like the staff is there for a paycheck. Here, the people really seem to enjoy their work environment and are glad you're there. They came by to refill drinks and see if we needed anything else. It was a Southwest Airlines experience.",

The food took a while but it came out hot and fresh. The chicken was really good. Really crispy and flaky. The cheese eggs were good as well. The grits were perfect.  However... wasn't a fan of the waffle AT ALL. I just had a couple bites and that was all. But overall the meal was great... i was a fan  Heres where it went bad for me...  Second visit I ordered takeout  4 chicken wings, cheese eggs and grits. And it came with toast.  I wanted extra butter for my grits and extra jelly for my toast. One of the employees told me that I could not have extra jelly.   Her words were \"You don't need anymore jelly for your toast\" and if I insisted on wanting more jelly I would have to pay 75 cents per jelly.   And they gave me an attitude for wanting extra butter for my grits.   I spent damn near 20 bucks on breakfast and they give me a hard time and tell me I dont need extra jelly???  I'm all about supporting local businesses but this was bad customer service. Especially comsidering the food is not cheap  I was a fan but not sure if I will come back if this is how they treat customers",

There was a line and a few tables available, not bad because the place is really small! Took like 15mins to order, there weren't any menus laying around to browse while I waited, but then I asked the cashier and she gave me 1. Whioe ordering the cashier wasn't helpful, her attitude was pleasant, but when I asked her questions she pointed to the menu *BLANKSTARE*. Ok moving on.... You must order before you take a sit, so as the line winded down I was worried there would be no seats to dine in, but luckily alot of people were just hanging around for take out orders. So my daughter & I snagged a table. It took the food about 10mins to be brought to us. We had fried chicken, fried fish filet, yams, waffle & greens. Food was fresh/hot and very tasty. Service was pleasant from the waitresses.   LUCKILY, I'm in a good mood! They ONLY loss 1 star because when I finished my greens I saw a strand of hair in my food, normally I would've complained but hell it was all gone! Also loss a star due to the cashier not assisting properly. I'll definitely be back to try other things and pray ain't no hair in my food ROLLS MY DAMN EYES!",

NOW to the food... I was with a group so we had mixed reviews. I myself ordered catfish with eggs. It was good. My husband ordered omelet, toast with grits and felt it was basics but good.

There are smaller sandwiches for less than $10, but I'm not a sandwich type of girl.  Nonetheless, I thought the food was pretty good. The catfish was delicious. I also had greens, but it didn't taste as good as homemade. The cornbread was okay; I've had better.  The waiters were really attentive. This could have been due to them being really nice or the place being super small; there were less than 10 tables. So, if you plan on bringing a big party, you might want to set up a reservation (if they take them) or just head somewhere else.  I would definitely go back though. I want to try the rest of the menu and the people were very nice.",

    "text": "I was so hoping Gritz Cafe would live up to the high ratings I had seen on Yelp. Alas, that level of anticipation and expectation may be what is driving my 2 star review.  I found the whole experience to be substandard to any Southern Soul Food dining experience I've had in my travels.  The menu was quite limited.  Food was not even served on a plate.  Everything was dished out on styrofoam plates/containers and the utensils were plastic.  I ordered the Mix-n-Match.  2 large fried chicken wings and 2 catfish fillets with greens, grits, and cornbread.  The bright spot was the chicken. The greens were also good but I could not find any pepper sauce to accompany them.  The cornbread was a light muffin and sweet.  The grits were good but seemed to be missing something (butter and heavy cream if I had to guess).  Most of the tables in the small dining area were filthy with crumbs from previous diners and no one from the staff seemed to care when I had to clean off my own table and chair before I could sit down. I know we are a long way from the southern states, but this could be so much better.",

The food is nicely flavored no hot sauce or special condiment needed. As far as the service, nothing to complain about . The only thing is they open at 7am-3pm I just don't understand why they would close so early with all the business they get.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat there again.",

Every person we came into contact with was so great. It really felt like my family. A couple of my aunts and my cousins and I love it! There was a continuous line out the door and every table was filled the entire time, but someone was always stopping by to make sure we were good.  Next the food. What our table had:  Chicken and Waffles Catfish Hotlinks Greens Mac n Cheese Yams Cheese Eggs Cornbread GRITZ!  EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. I didn't love the greens BUT they were good. But honestly everything we ate was well seasoned and cooked right! Honestly the best soul food WE had in Vegas (others tried were Soul Food Cafe and M&M's)! So good so, that my family and I asked to meet the owner and she actually came out gave us hugs and chatted with us even though they were extremely busy! That's that Louisiana in her!   AND the prices are reasonable! I actually recommended she raise her them, it was that satisfying! Especially when we compare what we've paid at similar places for less satisfying food and service! Y'all go support this sister, she deserves it!",

The store is crowded but I didn't mind standing. Unfortunately, a multitude of people came in with call-In orders that slowed the line down considerably.   We finally got a seat and the table was dirty. No worries, 20 minutes later it was cleaned. Another 20 minutes and the food was ready.   The order was the famous chicken and waffles, grits, sweet potatoes, bacon, and chicken. Being the first visit we wanted to sample most of everything.   The chicken was decent. A tad over fried and lacking seasoning but edible. The waffles/pancakes were terrible and tasted like they hopped from the Jiffy box straight to the plate. Another first date crushed.   For the lice, we were disappointed and the wait made it even worse. Save your dollars and keep looking. Perhaps a different menu item would be better but we went for the famous chicken and waffles and like the shiny casinos, left with less than we can with.",

I probably shouldn't have eaten it all in one sitting, but I killed it!! The grits were cooked just the way I like them, nice and creamy. I added some butter and pepper. The catfish was goooood!!! Hot, nicely seasoned and perfectly crispy!! Of course, I added some hot sauce. If I lived in Vegas, I'd come here several times a week!! Seat yourself, first come, first served.

It looks like Popeyes Chicken (you know how their chicken always looks perfect) but the flavor is amazing! Each bite I could literally taste all the different seasonings.   Corn bread was too small (only because I'm a fatty Mic Fat Fat) lol  Country fried steak was a-may-zing (only overwatch fans will get that one) I think my only complaint if I had one, would be a little too much gravy. But I can easily take some off.  The staff here make you feel so happy to be in their establishment. They're kind, they constantly check up on you and they are very humble. Thank you Gritts Cafe.",

The food alone is worth going but, the service is also fantastic. The entire restaurant has a great atmosphere.  Stop reading reviews. This is the place you are looking for!",

    "text": "I like this show called American Pickers, it centers around two guys with a van searching for awesome antiques in far flung areas, around the U.S. within old barns and old buildings, in the hope to score some great items to then sell for profit or their eccentric collections.   The same spirit engulfed you, when your friends say to you \"lest try this cool soul food restaurant tucked away behind some government buildings\"   Lest go! It's the only thing that should escape your lips.   Well I went. And much like some episodes in my pickers show, sometimes the picking is slim.   The star was the namesake, the grits, creamy and smooth. I should have ordered a tub of it and been happy. Instead I ordered their showcase: that includes their signature chicken and waffle.   You get 3 chicken wings, eggs, grits, and a waffle.   The eggs were over hard (asked for oe) the waffle was  grainy and partly raw, and the chicken wigs were pretty flavorless. :(((((   I hope they can bring it back up to match the glowing reviews and celebrities endorsements, but sadly it was dry pickings for me.",

Orders are drastically out of sequence and delayed.

If you have time definitely stop by; the GRITZ are a must!   I ordered bowl with grilled shrimp, egg whites and a biscuit and it smelled so amazing I devoured a lot of it in the parking lot.

Same as the chicken wings. My waffle had a nice buttery, cinnamon taste, with crunchy edges. The greens were okay...needed just a tad bit of seasoning. Added some hot sauce  to it, and problem was solved. I ended up in a food coma, so really didnt need anything else for the rest of the day. I hate the line, but it is worth it.  I noticed a lot of people taking their food to go, so that is another option. If you love some real serious soul food, please visit the next time you are in Vegas.",

Ordered the 2-piece chicken and waffles with cheese and onion grits. Staff were super friendly and took great care of me while I was waiting for my order to-go. The chicken was succulent and moist but still had a great breading that didn't overpower the chicken. This place hits the mark with their chicken simply because they do everything to order. Many places I've gone to back in Seattle leave their chicken under heat lamps, which dries out the meat and makes it like you're chewing a boot! Grits and waffles were out of this world as well.  The only qualm I have with this place was the small amount of seating. Originally I wanted to chill and dig in but since there was nowhere to sit, ended up eating in the car. However, it still was AMAZING. I'll be back for the shrimp and grits next time!",

It made me disappointed though that I played it safe and only ordered one piece of catfish with a piece of fried chicken.  I wasn't a big fan of the chicken and just felt the need to pour more and more hot sauce on it to make up for it.  I didn't play it safe on the side though and decided to try out the grits.  Problem was I had no idea what to do with them.  I tried to make them sweet with sugar packets and jelly but it just wasn't working.  I might to do more research on what to do with grits or just be lazy and just order the potatoes on the side if I ever do come back here.  So in the end my feelings on this place were mixed, I wouldn't argue if friend suggest to eat there, but I won't champion for it either.  Then again I might need to eat some more catfish in the future.",

We decided to take it to-go. At the last minute, about 12 people got up and cleared out. Me and my wife quickly grabbed a seat at the table, even though the table was super dirty with trash. I started to clear the table myself and my wife asked the short lady with the glasses for a wet cloth to clean it. The lady came over and CLEANED EVERY TABLE BUT OURS and didn't even give us a cloth to clean the table ourselves!  This place gets its popularity from locals in the North Vegas area that want something close. It's not worth driving across town for this restaurant.",

I don't like eggs much so I asked for just the biscuits and they didn't charge me for my coffee which I liked. The diner was as clean a looking and smelling establishment as I have ever seen and I'm a chef with 20+ years on the job. The staff were friendly and welcoming and nice. They don't have a wait staff per se you order and pick up from the counter but one of  the ladies brought my plate over. All food is on plastic throwaway flatware etc. My server noticed the portion was light and immediately took it back told the cook to fix it. I like the attentiveness of the server but at 10.50 for biscuits and gravy the cook should have known better since they had just opened and were not busy.. The biscuits were fresh the gravy was tasty but a little cool and again for over 10 bucks 3 biscuits is not outrageous portion vs food cost. I like the food and service overall but for breakfast the lack of traditional waitstaff and plastic ware will take some getting used to but I will come back as its down home cooking close to my house.",

What am I to do with this like...I'm thirsty not trying to brush my teeth. Their rude staff sucks big time! We are in Nevada if I spend money why not give a nice size cup of water its a desert out their. They seem to look down on you because you don't want a soda. But I just spent 30 bucks ugh! Now I have to spend 2 more bucks for water. lol Last I checked tap water is free. Its not as if they give you bottle water. Also I asked if the pudding is made from scratch. I was told yes. So I bought the pudding. However when I got home I could not believe my eyes. The pudding was box made. I Deceive you not people.  So I jumped back into my SUV and ran back across town to gritz. I was met by the same older lady who had lied to my face. OMG you think you can trust someone thats old enough to be your grand mother.  Ugh! but anyway when I told her why I was back and that I wanted a refund she gave a piss poor excuse as to why she deceived me. She said I think of gritz cafe as my home so I used box pudding and to me thats home made.  I replied only a person who cant cook would give an excuse such as this. Gas is not cheap and you lady just are a pure liar. She wasted my time and money. If I return I will only be getting catfish and maybe chicken I have had both those dishes and they were great.",

They made me feel warm and cuddly with their constant checking in. The propieter even made a round of the tables, asking the guests if they wanted water, a to-go box, etc.  I ordered their catfish basket with french fries; a Sprite on the side. My total was $11.35 for a good handful of seasoned fries, 4 pieces of free-range catfish that were at least 6\" in length and a huge soda. I could be prickly about the expensivity of the meal; however, ingredient costs have skyrocketed in recent months, so it's totally understandable.  Surrounded by good company and good food, I will definitely come here again. Thank you, Gritz Cafe!",

I'm from New Orleans, LA and haven't found a good soul food resturaunt in Vegas yet. Every place I've been is all imitation. But Gritz Cafe, the best soul food business in town!  I order the Louisiana special for breakfast on my visit. Four grilled hot links, scrambled eggs with cheese, butter biscuits, and southern style potatoes were on my plate baby. I ate it all in about 3 minutes with room for seconds lol. The best breakfast I've had in years since my mama's cooking.  The sitting area is pretty small and seating is limited. The place was packed and we had to wait til a table cleared before we got to sit down. Thankfully a family was leaving before our food was ready or else we would've been forced to take our food to go. The pricing of the food was expected and worth every penny. But you can always call in your order before arriving.  I will definitely visit this resturaunt again, and again, and again.",

A mistake was made upon my order and when I mentioned it to the cashier, she appeared \"bothered\" , but proceeded to tell the cook the order change.  I then mentioned yhe price difference and she proceeded to tell me its the same price.  When I showed her the $2 difference, she was annoyed.  She then calculated my correct order plus tax and deducted it fron the price of my original order but neglected to add the tax i had already paid and proceeded to give me $1.27 back in change.  I mentioned it should be over $2 with tax because there is a $2 difference from the menu prices alone.  She disagreed and i just said forget it.  Mind you it is only $1 difference but it is the principle.  I should have kept my tip.  The food was average at best and the order came out wrong for both our dishes.  One had the wrong meat and the other had no cheese.  The server applogized, but the whole experience was disappointing and I really wanted to like this place.",

I would have never hit this place up had it not been for a Groupon coupon ($7 for $15 in food)  This is Soul food at its finest.  We had their chicken and waffles which comes with one waffle and 3 whole chicken wings.  I made love to them chicken wings.  I don't leave any meat, skin, or cartilage on the bone.  The bone is sucked dry and rightfully so as it is perfectly seasonsed with the delicious cripsness.  The waffles are similar to Roscoe's in texture but the flavor was really good.  I wish the waffles were a little crisp but they are more of a pancake waffle texture.  In addition to the chicken and waffles, we tried their Grits which were butterty, rich, and went down smoothly with the Chicken and Waffles.  Throw in a side of greens and 2 drinks and w/o the Groupon it was only $21.   Ok I'm not being racist here but you have to judge the food by its loyal customers.  For instance, if you go to a Korean restaurant and see 99% white people, it's probably not good....right?   As we walked into Gritz with all 9 of its tables, we were the only non-AA people there.   To me, that means I hit the jackpot when it comes to soul food.  Sorry....I had to go there....but it's True.  At least I'll say it :)  The owners were super nice and chatted with us about the food.  We told them we'll be back and for good reason.  Cheap, delicious, home comfort food at its finest.  Considering how much love M&M gets, Grifz Cafe should as well.  Be sure to check them out!",

    "text": "The first time I had grits was in basic training.  The first morning of basic training was the first hellish day: we had to eat breakfast together at the same time and in 3 minutes flat.  I thought omelet, toast, links, and a medium glass of orange juice was going be easy, but hell no! So, all morning during our combat timed exercises, I was running on secretly stored fat in  the body to substantiate for energy, oh, and water that TSGT. verbally (every 3 seconds) emphasized water or his spits coming from his fierce mouth as he curses us throughout the long days. The second morning, I quickly scanned the food line and thought to myself, \"....fn, yeah, I need something fast-3 min quick like soup with some texture for my stomach (who makes soup in the mornings?)!...\" Then it hit me, I saw someone in front of me grab a bowl of white sandy pebbles that looked like the cousin of oatmeal: GRITS. It was March 2000 that I was introduced to Grits.  Every morning for about 4 months I'd eat grits bland & snuck a bacon for flavor (thinking I created my own recipe for a moment, what ever works is my modo).    I LOVE grits, therefore, I love this place.  It's located in front of (diagonal like) the FBI building on Lakemead b4 Martin Luther King Blvd.  The place is small to almost medium sized seating area with 9 tables( four of them are 2 people tables, 5 of them are for 4people tables), just get there early or hope once you walk in you see peeps walk out.  I had the Mississippi plate (about 6 strips of well seasoned fried catfish, 2 sunny side eggs, a small bowl of chosen: cheddar & bacon grits, and a moist/flakey biscuit).  Next time, I am just getting the big bowl of grits with catfish, cheddar, & bacon. My Wife had the plate with hot links(tasty) with jalapeno in her grits.  I bought a Groupon: $7 for $15 & just today, Danna bought one (so 4sure, we'll be back).  I saw a lot of people before me order their food \"2go\", smart but I wanted grits fresh & now.  I do not like waiting but if it's food that people at their tables licking their fingers like they're in the comfort of their home, well, why not?  I LOVE grits like a proud moment in time, Thanks, TSGT. De Bose!!!!",

The chicken wings were cooked to perfection!...Hubby had the Catfish and he has told everyone how good it was.  On our second trip I had the Grit bowl and it too was delicious.  I'm going for number three as soon as I hit Vegas in a few weeks!",

I got chicken fried steak it wasn't that great at all. Their meat tasted like they use low quality meat. We will never come back here again. Too far of a drive and the food nothing great.",

Or, at least, more options of them ( like-regular, cheese polenta, w/red eye gravy, etc) not just the option of \"toppings\" * Potatoes are good * Everything fresh and cooked to order * Nice cozy inside * Good service * Price a little high for what you get - lower the price and its fine. Or, keep the cost the same but raise the level of execution. A place called Gritz, located in the \"Hood\", priced pointed high, should have some more soul to its food...more \"stank\" on it. But all in all Ive had worse. Ive been to this type of place all over the US...heck Ive been to this place before. I respect the effort  and would return.",

The only downside to this place is that it's a very small restaurant and it can get a little busy during certain times of the day, so you may have to wait a while for seating. Also the seating is very cramped. Additionally, carry cash to this establishment as you will either pay .50 per credit and debit card transaction or their debit/ credit card machine will not work.  But their food is so good. I love home cooked style food. I think they need to relocate to a larger facility to accommodate more patrons. I would definitely recommend this place to eat.",

The portions are large enough to share; however, I'm not sure if all will want to share. The grits are creamy, very creamy. If you have a passion for cream, you'll find it here. I, too, enjoyed the catfish. It's an abundant amount (4). The coating is a seasoned cornmeal. The chicken wings are as good as they look. The floured dredge is lightly seasoned. I appreciate the hint of onion powder! We could not leave without trying the waffle. If you like a waffle that a bit of a crisp outer edge, this is the one. That's a sign of BUTTER in the batter . . . Mmmm! Their coffee is good. I appreciate the option of flavored creamers, if that's your preference.   The only negative I'd give this establishment is its small dine-in are continuous customers base, we were able to snag a table in minutes. (I'm not sure how much of that was luck . . . )",

If you're visiting and don't have a car it's merely a $10 Uber ride which is more than worth it. If you do live in Vegas then it's literally five or 10 minutes from the strip.  It's family-owned which I always love because not only is it mom and pop can definitely see the mom-and-pop feeling here. It's like being in your own grandma's kitchen. The staff is friendly and will answer and help you out with any questions you may have. The food after the experience simply awesome. It taste like it was made with the personal touch and will keep you wanting more. We ordered everything from fish two waffles to fry chicken and we loved it all.  If you're looking for something outside of the norm of the normal dining in Vegas and don't mind going off script for a second then this is the perfect place for you!!  #EatHereOrNot",

Yes indeed - there it was, the FBI.  My friend and I trekked here for lunch around 1 PM on a weekday. I was half expecting the place to be packed and we'd have to take our food to go, but I was pleasantly surprised we were able to eat there. It is a small place, with a few tables, and some two-tops along the back wall.   Ordering is done before you seat yourself and then the food is delivered out to you, as well as your fountain drink.  I got the PO BOY - Fried Catfish served on a 6\" grilled hoagie roll with lettuce, tomatoes, and special sauce ($8.50). I am a fan of fried catfish. I have had it fished out of a river, and fried up right before my eyes at many family gatherings in Texas. This fried catfish was wonderful! The crispiness of the fish was perfect, whatever recipe they are using is damn good. The sandwich itself is perfectly portioned with lettuce, cut tomatoes and their special sauce. I also added a good dousing of hot sauce on mine. I was in catfish sandwich (er, PO BOY) HEAVEN.  The restaurant itself is clean and tidy. Service is on point. I will be back!",

That was a first. Menu was pretty simple, a bit flimsy, with unflattering meal photos. Ordered the grits with our dish-served in a separate Styrofoam bowl-and they were a nice consistency and flavorful. The chicken was fried through but under seasoned; the waffle was nicely browned just like I like it. Plastic utensils were unexpected though. The staff was attentive to the patrons and well trained on sanitary conditions as we noticed multiple utensils fall to the floor and quickly removed and replaced with clean items. I did not notice any staff members wash their hands and was a bit annoyed when an employed came to my table and began taking  the jelly assortment decanter BEFORE asking if it was okay that she take it for another table.  The location is off the main street but quite busy/popular with the nearby company employees and locals. I found nothing special with Gritz Cafe that would entice me to return but it's a nice little spot that has found its way into favor.",

The catfish is really good.  For some reason I can just eat the sides.  Love there home fried potatoes.  I just ordered the chicken fried steak and gravy, haven't tried it, but it looks good.  Tomorrow I tackle the chicken wings, I understand there is a special on Thursdays.   Don't forget to try the lemon cake,  you will love it.  I have talked so much about the food but let me mention the service is excellent.  Staff tries really hard to make sure you have everything.  They were busy on Sunday but I was still greeted. with a smile.  It is probably better to order take out.  If it is crowded it can be a challenge to find a seat.

There was a line, and a wait for the food, but that's to be expected for cooked to order food.   The food and service is what makes it 5 Stars! We had the country fried steak and the grits with eggs & bacon. My eggs were cooked perfectly over medium, the grits were perfect, and the country fried steak was delicious.",

It's a small little place so don't be surprised if you can't find seating for more than maybe 3-4 people. We went on a Sunday and it was definitely their busiest time and even though you order and seat yourself the staff is very attentive in making sure you have everything you need. We ordered the chicken and waffles and were not disappointed!",

    "text": "It's been a few years since I first rolled in and tasted a Grits Bowl with pork.  Fast forward a few years as the Breakfast Club was prepping to assemble..The question is pitched....\"Where we gonna eat?\"  And so it was Gritz.  Located across the street from the FBI building, you blink and you just might miss it.  If located, Gritz is small, clean and takes on home cooking in a simple yet sophisticated manner.  It's at the counter ordering and this includes the drinks.  When the cup (containing coffee) run empty, head to the counter.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  I ordered up the biscuits and gravy, each topped with a country sausage gravy and comes with two eggs (any style).  The biscuits were soft and the gravy divine. There is just enough to satisfy without saturating your plate.  Upon further reflection there is just enough gravy to keep you from going and ordering another batch, even though deep down inside you want to put yourself into a gravy coma.  NOW..for the name sake minus a slight change in spelling.  The grits are the best I have ever had.  They are of perfect consistency all the way through.  They do not convert to a slushy cream of wheat mixture the further down the bowl you go.  PLUS-you can add grits toppings for an additional 75 cents each.  Those toppings are cheese, bacon, mushrooms, onions or jalapenos.  I had cheese and bacon.....it was awesome.  The plasticware kind of sucks as I flicked a piece of biscuit in my hair BUT I get how it can keep cost down.",

    "text": "My friends and I were searching for a soul food place and were told to go here by a Vegas native. Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was and it caught all of us by surprise. It is way north of the strip, but so worth the drive. Gritz Cafe is located on a small street off of MLK road in a business park/strip mall.   As we walked in we noticed the place was very small (about 10 tables) and it smelled like Heaven. The staff greeted us right away, gave us menus, and told us to take our time ordering. We felt right at home when we walked in the door as the staff reminded us of our family members and their good home cooking. It was great to see the variety of main and side item choices on the menu. I selected the Louisiana, which was a hot link plate and a side of grits with bacon bits (first toping is free) and greens; and a piece of cornbread. My friends order fried chicken, fried catfish, waffles, mac n' cheese, greens, and eggs.   Our food was brought out one by one by a wonderful server who was very attentive and sweet. The food was very hot, fresh, and flavorful. The hot links had just the right amount of spice, the grits(z) were smooth and creamy, and the greens were seasoned just right that I did not even need any hot sauce! (smile) All of us shared our food, so I got a chance to try the mac n' cheese and waffles that were just as flavorful and wonderful. We spent the entire meal talking about how awesome the food was and how we want to come back the next time we were in Vegas. The only thing missing in the restaurant was some cots as we all needed a nap afterwards. (smile)  It is hard to find good soul food in Phoenix, so each time I go to Vegas Gritz will be on my list of restaurants to eat at! So worth the drive for the awesome food and service!!",

We vacationed in Las Vegas last weekend and I wanted some soul food outside of the strip, so I turned to Yelp and found this place. My daughter and I hopped in our rent a car from our hotel and were on our way. I had chicken and a waffle with a side of grits and my daughter ordered fried chicken, candied yams and Mac and cheese. I'm very critical and particular about my soul food and soul food establishments, but I have to say everything at this place was done well. The food came out very quickly in disposable containers. Everything that we ordered was super good. Everyone that worked there were very nice and pleasant. The only downfall was the place didn't have a lot of seating, but everyone pretty much courteously ate and left and didn't really do too much lounging due to the limited seating.",

Everything was bland. the greens juice was damn near clear no seasoning what so ever. the yams were good needed more sugar. Overall not impressed and won't be back.

Everyone was welcoming and friendly, the place was cozy, the bathroom's super clean too.  We ordered Louisiana links and eggs for my date and chicken and waffles for me. They ran out of full wings so they offered me party wings instead. While we were finishing up our order I noticed the catfish and waffles that was waiting to be served which looked yummy so I asked if I can have half wings and half catfish instead. The cashier said they normally don't' do it but she was super nice and let me have it instead. When our food was served, I was given a full order of wings instead and I mentioned the mistake. Told them not to worry about it and I'll just eat what I had(which was a lot) but they insisted to give the catfish too. That's what I call good service.  Anyway, our food was piping hot. Hubby loved his links and eggs. The links were juicy and flavorful. I wasn't able to get a picture because he wolfed it all down. My party wings were crunchy in the outside and juicy in the inside. They complimented the waffles really well. The catfish was good too but I preferred the wings. I liked their hot sauce too. Not too spicy, just right.   With 5 star service and very good, affordable food, we will be back. Looking forward to trying their shrimp and grits.",

Sometimes they visit the table more times than you actually care to see them.. and other times you have to ask them to the table. Not a complaint, just an observation.  My only issue with Gritz... is the paper plates and plastic silverware.  I understand the business is small and probably doesn't have a complete full kitchen to manage washing multiple plates ect.. but it feels cheap.. and while the food is reasonable it is not cheap.. if that makes sense.  the food itself is always good, I have never come here and not been satisfied. The chicken.. flavorful, the grits.. creamy, the fish... piping hot...  I look forwarding to seeing Gritz possibly expand and being more of a force in the valley. I think they have the potential.",

Not to mention, that they seemed to be using instant Gritz for their famous Gritz bowls. This saddens me as I've been a customer for years and the quality of the food seems to heading downward; especially with the premium prices they charge.",

    "text": "I decided to eat here while on vacation as suggested by my sister who ate here on her vacation prior. I went with a party of 4 around noon on a weekday. The size of the place is very deceiving and the place was packed the entire time I waited inside. It's extremely small with a limited amount of tables to eat-in. My party ordered dinners that consisted of catfish, chicken wings, greens, grits bowl, yams, cornbread, and waffles. We had other sides but, forgot what they were. However, I really wanted to love this place but, wasn't overly impressed as I hoped to be. We were standing waiting for our food for well over an hour and eventually, was forced to eat in our car because of no seating and was also, a wait on tables. As for the food, it was pretty average. My daughter hated the yams and said they tasted weird and wasn't sweet. The chicken was alright but, I preferred another area soulfood place in the area a little better that I visit when I'm in town. My hubby loved the grits bowl with eggs. He said the waffle was average and probably would've been better if he'd have eaten it hot inside instead of a container that made it soft after a few minutes. Both my daughter and he too, agreed that the other soulfood place had better tasting chicken wings. I personally, liked their greens but, they needed a little salt to my liking so, I added some. My daughter enjoyed her catfish but, I thought it needed a little salt too. The cornbread was average, and not bad. We were given complimentary soft drinks, and lemon cake slices because we waited so long which, was cool. I may come back for a takeout order in the future.",

It's a small place, in North Las Vegas. If you didn't know it was there, you'd probably drive right past it. I found my new spot to grub and be happy. I will definitely return for many visits in the near future to try the rest of the menu.   Southern comfort food at a great price!!",

The only downside to this place is that it's a very small restaurant and it can get a little busy during certain times of the day, so you may have to wait a while for seating. Also the seating is very cramped. But their food is so good. I love home cooked style food. I think they need to relocate to a larger facility to accommodate more patrons. I would definitely recommend this place to eat.",

    "text": "I had breakfast here a few weeks ago. It was great! For starters..the restaurant is clean..it may be a bit small, but not overly so. We stopped in around 9 or 10 in the morning and it wasn't crowded at all. No seating issues whatsoever. Just so you know, you order at the counter and someone brings out the food. The ladies that assisted us were very friendly.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I had the grits bowl with catfish and boy was it good! It had been a while since I had a bowl of grits so it was very satisfying. The fish was fresh and delicious. While the piece could have been a bit larger, it was hot and it was well prepared. The bowl had grits and an egg. It was great in it's simplicity. Hind sight, I wish that I had have ordered sausage or bacon because it would have been great adding it to the bowl. The idea of crumbling up the fish and adding it to my grits bowl didn't appeal to me so I ate it on the side as it came.  Since I enjoyed my breakfast so much, I decided to try some dessert because they had one of my favorites on the menu...peach cobbler! I asked the young lady who assisted us to warm it up for me and she did..I enjoyed this peach cobbler. It was a FIRST. Everywhere I've gone and have ordered it, I've been disappointed. Theirs was very good and made with good ingredients. They didn't skimp on the butter and REAL vanilla as these are two key ingredients to a good cobbler.  I like the premise of this restaurant. Grits are way underrated in my opinion. They have more to offer than just grits. I saw someone's plate of chicken and waffles and I almost broke my neck as it was brought to their table..LOL!! The fried chicken looked beautiful...golden brown..I'll definitely try it at some point.  I'll definitely be back...They have a good thing going here.",

It is reasonably priced, IF you aren't being a fatty. The average person would spend $10- $15. We spent  $35/two people + tip. The service was great! They were friendly and attentive. The manager/owner checked on us multiple times. The waffle was ok and the cornbread wasn't what I would have expected. But overall, it was yummy!!",

I have no idea what he's talking about, cause mine was the bomb!  I wasn't even trying to hear what he was talking about!  After about the 3rd piece of chicken, he asked to try a piece of my chicken!  and he really liked it!  He said he was glad he tasted mine, because it left a good taste in his mouth.

    "text": "Had the Kentucky  with 4 big ole chicken wings fried to perfection , grits  eggs and a english muffin.  Bae had chicken and waffles. He wasn't impressed. We did have to wait for 40 min and bae waffles was cold. Overall I thought it was really good.  Everything was cooked well. The portions sizes were good too. The atmosphere is like M&Ms souls food in LA. The staff were nice.  There  were people from everywhere coming through. The only thing I didnt like was the use of paper and plastic settings.for dine in and The seating area is small. They seem to do more business with to go orders. I think they should have a patio that would be cool. They close daily at the  3pm. .",

The food was cooked to perfection and I use to be a real big boy so when it came to the grits I was extra watchful. However the grits were cook perfectly. The service was great also. It's always great to see \"black owned and operated\" done in excellence.",

No complaints about the service, everyone seemed to be very attentive and helpful.   Only reason that I won't give 5 stars is because of the size of the restaurant and the hours of operation. There's only about 8-10 tables available, so you're lucky if you're able to get a seat. Gritz closes at 3 pm, so this is definitely not a dinner option.",
