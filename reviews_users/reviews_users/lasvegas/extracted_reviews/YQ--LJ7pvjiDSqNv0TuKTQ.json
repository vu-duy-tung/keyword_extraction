The Caesar salad was tasty and our sausage and pepperoni pizza was good but it just wasn't the same as enjoying this pizza in NY. I had a couple slices and was fine to box up the rest to bring with us. Something I would never do in NY, I'd polish the entire thing off and maybe order one for the road.  I was super stoked to see they had opened in Vegas and it's a fantastic dining option as they are open until 2A but noticeably different than their NY locations.",

The crust is perfect (currently slightly drooling thinking about such amazing carbs), not to mention the melted mozzarella, and the ever so slightly tangy, yet somehow spicy but well-seasoned marinara.   Hungry yet?   I know I am.   I prefer the large pizza because its your best bang for the buck.  This pizza is killer the next day!  My personal favorites are the chicken sausage, jalapenos (ask them to go easy because they're HOT), and mushrooms.   Done, and done.   I could go on forever and paint the perfect picture of this pizza but seriously you'd waste too much time reading my review when you should just be eating there already!  Also, the spinach salad is a must as well, just make sure to tell them no bacon. It'll mess with your palate otherwise.   Either way I think I'll have pizza now!

Stop making stupid people famous!  And stop over hyping bullsh*t food! This is the furthest thing from good pizza. If this good pizza then I'm the Pope who's having a really and day.  Im going to admit that I am stupid. I keep falling for the hype and I'm constantly getting punished with bad food.  I've given up on trying to find good pizza in CA. Many of my friends said that Grimaldi's the shiz but it's in vegas. You know that saying about whatever happens in vegas? This pizza should never leave vegas. Grimaldi's, stay put because your pizza is fraudulent. You do not serve \"NYC style pizza\", you serve a sub par version of the same thing I can get at a pieology franchise and it's waaaaaaay less expensive. Pieology also labels their pizza properly. Grimaldi's, you serve neopolitan style and you do it poorly.  Once the pizza arrived at our table, just looking at it, I was already disappointed. It was burnt, not browned. The sauce looked like it just came straight out of a BPA lined can.   When i took my first bite, I noticed that it was under seasoned and that blaring red sauce was way too acidic. Have these cooks ever heard of using sugar to cut down on the acid? WTF, this is amateur sh*t people! This is pizza sauce 101. I made a better pizza with a boboli crust when I was a kid and I didn't even know what the f*ck I was doing back then.  Also, I have never had a pizza turn my hands black. Yes, my hands were black. (See napkin picture)  This place is a bust. Over priced. Over hyped. The odds will be against you. The \"pizza\" only lives up to the first part of its namesake, \"Grim\".",

The sausage tasted like sausage from pizza hut. Good pizza should not fall apart when i'm eating it. Overall, the pizza was just bland with nothing exciting about it. At the end, the server charged me 5 dollars more than our total bill, and when I asked her about it, she said she didn't remember and just handed me 5 dollars from someone else's check. Very unprofessional. I was in vegas looking for a good place to eat and this place received 4.5 stars. Why. There is nothing 4 stars about this place.",

    "text": "Ah, eating here made me reminiscent of NYC.   I remember going to Grimaldi's the first time and loved it! If you want True thin crust NYC pizza, you can definitely get it at Grimaldi's!  The restaurant is located in the Palazzo among the flashy stores and this establishment itself is nice and has patio seating.  They're also open til 2AM which is a plus!   The menu is typical Grimaldi's pizza or salad.  Pizza selections include a regular pizza, pizza with pesto, white pizza with garlic or a calzone.  There's a variety of toppings you can select from including sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, italian sausage, ham and sweet red peppers just to name a few.  We opted for the small white pizza with garlic, italian sausage, kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes. This was delicious and the small comes with big slices! I think there were six slices total.  They were generous with the toppings as well. We both loved the olives (and yay we didn't get any pits!).    Our server was great, very energetic and enthusiastic.  Food came out fairly quick (granted it was later in the evening 11PMish).  Love Grimaldi's and was happy to get a taste of NYC on the west!",

We went there with 3 people...myself,my wife and her best friend. 2 of us ordered calzones and one ordered a personal pizza.  They brought the pizza out right away and the 2 that ordered the calzones had to wait 5-10 extra minutes because the calzones take longer to cook.  We didn't say anything to the waiter or make any comments or even feel that it was that big of a deal but the manager came over and apologized for the difference in time between the pizza and the calzones.  She offered to buy us dessert.  We all just thought it was very professional that they addressed the problem even though we never even said there was an issue.    Fun and classy place...highly recommend!",

We added our own toppings: pesto base, Italian sausage, mushrooms, olives, fresh tomatoes, & sweet peppers on thin yummy crust. It took time to prepare but was very much worth it, so delicious! We got thge large 18 inch for 4 of us which was more than plenty. We also had the Mediterranean Salad came in a largish bowl, it was so fresh, crispy and a very good size that you can easily split. For dessert we had the Baileys Irish cream cheesecake and Tiramisu, both were excellent. They made the cheesecake in house (!) and the Tiramisu they order. My mom hates cheesecake, but the Irish cream flavor made her love it. Honestly, one of the best freshest cheesecakes I've ever had. Service was also excellent. I would absolutely go again if this was in PDX. The atmosphere at the Palazzo was lovely, made to feel like you are in Italy. It was funny when the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out and my dad asked my mom for his jacket hahah. I mean, you are inside regardless but with that beautiful blue painted sky, it's easy to forget!",

I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and a small pizza.  I couldn't decide between two pies so the server suggested I do a half and half!  I thought that was awesome considering I was only getting a small pie.  I got half white pie with mushrooms and half red with meatballs.  I couldn't decide which side was better... both were absolutely amazing!  The pizza had perfectly crispy thin crust And to make deciding my favorite thing worse, the Mediterranean Salad was sooooooooooo good!  It was a huge salad and everything was just so fresh too.

The crust here is done right. They bake it in a coal oven just like the east coast. Although not environmentally friendly, it brings out the crisp char (but still maintaining the chewiness)  I thought the sauce was zesty and delicious but very stingy with the toppings! How dare you charge $2 for spinach but put in like 2 leaves in there. Also not a fan of the pepperoni as it was too salty. The service was extremely slow and we sat there for 30 minutes before our waiter told us that they ran out of sausage. Would I go back though? Yes! As it's very hard to get a good slice on the west coast and Grimaldi's still holds True to their roots.",

Thank goodness we did because we decided to eat at this pizza spot first.  We arrived around 11 am and a line had already formed to eat this famous pizza, but the line moved pretty quickly and our party of nine didn't have to wait longer than 20 minutes. The cool thing is that this restaurant is located in the Fashion Show Mall, so I can window shop.  The pizzas were a good size, we ordered three large pies. 1) The classic Margherita 2) White pizza (no tomato sauce) with garlic and mushrooms 3) Tomato sauce based pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and olives  All pizzas were good, with a thin crust and not too soggy. My personal favorite was the white pizza. So simple yet very flavorful! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza I have ever had but it's definitely something you should try.  Expect your experience to be quick, we ordered the pizzas and were in and out in less than an hour. You'd have to expect a quick dining experience especially if a line is waiting outside.",

Right off the bat the guy took our drink order and even catered to our 10 month old. And by catered I mean water cup with a lid and straw, high chair and even a pizza dough to place with! So the service was awesome (: Now the food, we ordered a Caprese & large Caeser Salad, Large Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza and a dessert Trio (you choose which one you want): Baileys cheesecake, Tiramisu and a Canolli.  First of the Caeser salad was freaking AMAZING! the large was big enough to be shared by four people and have enough to get seconds for everyone. The Caprese was alright, what threw me off is the basil they were using. Either its gone bad and that's why its such a dark green or I've never tasted real basil before. Anyways, the large pizza was more than enough for four people. My mother & father in law were saying that the sausage had a little kick to it so my 5 year old sister in law couldn't/wouldn't eat it. Other than that, I thought it was alright. Never really tasted an \"authentic\" pizza so I don't have much to go off on. Now the dessert ... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! It's nice that they have an option/bundle to try some dessert with decent portion.   ***Again, everything we got was more than enough for four people and a toddler.",

No outdoor seating however.   Started with the spinach salad to get our veggies.  Nothing out of the ordinary here, but it really hit the spot.  Just the right amount of onion.  The pizza is thin crust cooked in coal oven.  Crust was nicely browned.  The sauce was neutral and nice.  Mozzarella and mushrooms completed the process.  This pizza hit the spot!

After trying out Lombardi in NY, which is also very popular for their pizza and now Grimaldi...NY pizza may not be the best to me anymore.   Grimaldi pizza was slightly better than Lombardi but it's not the best that I had. It was thin but wasn't crispy either. The sauce was nothing special.

They were all chatting up about work and customers and to busy to see I was standing their waiting. When the bartender who took my order saw me he said, \"what's up homie\"... first off I am a customer, secondly I am a female well in my 40's and I am not a \"homie\"... this is not a relaxed sports bar atmosphere and was reminded of that when my two young daughters were asked to leave the bar area but not offered a place to wait.

I've been a regular to the BK, NY location for about 7 years back and was so excited to see one here when we were walking through the shops. Pretty slow night for them and yet the service was bit slow at the bar. That being said, if you have never tried pizza from a coal fired brick oven, you owe it to yourself to try it and this place does it right. We ordered one traditional margarita pie with extra roma tomatoes and one classic pie with meatballs and bacon. Both pies were great. They are also known for their calzones. A small calzone is more than enough for two people. The pizza was incredible, but it's not as good as you'd get in NYC. Granted, this is probably psychological! I'm still willing to bet it'll top all other pizza offerings in Vegas.  All in all it was an amazing meal and I would definitely eat there again!",

When we are deciding our lunch and pizza comes up it's always the same..  Grimaldi's? Ehhh no I don't want to have to deal with the terrible staff that hates their jobs ... I'd rather get kicked in the stomach for lunch than have to talk to these people and deal with the attitudes and horrible customer service. If they want some advice don't tell their customers their food will take 20 min and it be ready an hour later. Don't leave your customers waiting unattended and then greet them like they are an inconvenience. If you all hate your jobs that much you should quit. I talk to hundreds of people a month and will tell them all the same when deciding on a place to eat.  Don't waste your money in this place people!!!  Go to grand lux or even subway upstairs. Hell, I'd rather eat Auntie Annie's pretzels than this place. This is my year long experience with this place! Get it together people.",

A favorite is the Don. I like to customize it because I don't eat meatballs. They won't let you substitute or do \"half & half.\" For that reason, I have to deduct a star. Seems like an establishment that caters to its customers would allow a minor substitution or half-and-half on a pizza. Perhaps that's just me.  Our pizza came out smoking hot and it was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect way to end a long drive into sin city. He also ordered a Caesar salad which was really good.  Service was friendly and efficient. No complaints there. Just wish they monitored the bathrooms more frequently. They were absolutely disgusting. That's unacceptable.  I love the pizza here, but I can only give them four stars because the bathroom was disgusting and I wish they would allow us to do half-and-half on our pizza or at least a minor substitution.",

It was plenty to share amongst us.  We even had a couple slices leftover to take for late night munchies.  Their Caesar Salad ($10/ large) is one of the best I've had. The greens were fresh, crisp and not drenched in dressing. The croutons were crunchy, but not too hard.  A good choice for a starter.  The Brooklyn Bridge ($24/ large) pizza is a must get.  It's a traditional pizza with red peppers, sausage and most importantly... ricotta cheese!  The ricotta adds a rich creaminess to the pizza that is drool worthy.  Our second pizza was a simple meatball and pepperoni, but it had really good flavor.  These people know how to do pizza.  Their  crust to sauce to toppings ratio is on point.  You can taste the quality and the prices are not bad. This is becoming one of my go-to places in Vegas.",

Also, when you call in to place your order, they have recorded what you got last time! Makes it so much more personal! They also save any of your discounts on file (like military for example) and apply it to your orders every time! Great pizza and great customer service! What else can you ask for!",

Yes at least an hour to cook your food and that probably goes without saying depending on the amount of people that are there.

    "text": "Pizza is my favorite food and Grimaldi's definitely hits the mark. My boyfriend and I just happened across this place as we were walking through the Venetian, and made it a point to come here based on the reputation of the New York location. Going in, I was a little confused about what to expect because the restaurant is set up to look like a casual, fast pizza place, but mixed with fine dining. For example, they had checkerboard/picnic blanket table cloths, but each table had a couple of wine glasses. I wasn't sure where on the scale of Little Caesars to artisan pizza this was going to fall.   Thankfully, there was no wait here, unlike what I've heard about the New York location. We were seated right away and the hostess was very accommodating when I asked to be seated at a table other than the one she initially pointed out. I really liked the table that we did sit at, because we could look out of the restaurant and see the crystal decorations of the Venetian.   Our server was with us right away as well and quickly brought out water with ice upon our request. He let us take our time to figure out what we wanted to eat, and even suggested a small salad while we decided.   We chose the Caesar Salad, and as our server suggested, it was more than enough for the two of us. It was also really tasty; I almost forgot to take a picture of it before it was all gone. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was evenly tossed. The croutons were also really great, large pieces and very crunchy. The salad was topped off with fresh shaved parmesan and our server also helped us with some cracked pepper. Very good start to the meal.  The pizza menu does not have many preset combinations eg. veggie/meat lovers. Instead, they have a basic crust with sauce and cheese (prized on size)  and you can add on toppings for $2-$4 based on what they are. I believe the cost of the topping is regardless of size of the pizza you choose. The are based on \"premium\" vs \"regular\" topping eg. artichoke vs extra cheese. They also have an option of red or white sauce and a pesto option.  For our pizza, we knew we wanted Italian Sausage on there right away, but for the rest of the toppings, we were a bit more selective based on each others' preferences and the quickly increasing price. I consented to Pepperoni while my boyfriend allowed for the Fresh Sliced Roma Tomatoes. We also got the Fresh Baby Spinach, Fresh Garlic, and Extra Mozzarella Cheese. We ordered it all on a small size (16 inch) pizza, which was enough for the two of us.  It did take a while for the pizza to come out, but we enjoyed our time watching from the window. When the pizza arrived, I was so excited because it was bigger than I expected, and it also smelled and looked amazing. I consider myself to be a pizza genius now, because the combination of toppings we had picked out worked so awesome together. I know, it's just a basic meat pie, but I thought it was almost mind-blowing. The sausage was very traditional and tasty and complemented their famous sauce very well. I also loved the spinach on the pizza and wish there had been more. The garlic really made the dish for me, I really looked forward to the bites where I could see little clusters of garlic. Really, each bite was packed with flavor and I could not stop eating.   Even though I was completely stuffed after the pizza, I wanted to order the Tiramisu because my boyfriend had never had it before. While it was not the best tiramisu I have ever had, it was quality dessert and a very good first try for my boyfriend. We both enjoyed how creamy the mascarpone was and how moist the ladyfingers were.  The highlight of this experience was definitely the pizza (as it should be) and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. With the personalization of the pizzas, everyone can get something they love.",

There are no witty hipster names or fancy concoctions here.  In fact, I was surprised to find that the menu didn't even provide any suggestions for topping combinations.  Just a choice of regular, white, or pesto base, and a list of run-of-the-mill ingredients such as pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc.  But don't let the simplicity of the menu fool you.  The crust was thin and impossibly crispy, with no hint of getting limp as we bore through the 12\" pizza.  The sauce packed a pleasant tangy punch.  The pepperoni was thick, chock full of flavor, all around excellent.  The italian sausage was pleasant, and our mushrooms remained fat and tender despite the coal oven.   Grimaldi's wins you over with fresh, high quality ingredients - no frills or fluff.  It has definitely upped my pizza game, and I can only hope Grimaldi's finds its way to the Washington DC area!",

    "text": "My family and I were on our way to see family in CA and stopped in Vegas overnight. We were staying at the Palazzo and looking for a place that was somewhat family-friendly as we had four of our five boys traveling with us. The Palazzo hotel has a mall inside of it with several shops and restaurants. As we were walking around, we spotted Grimaldi's Pizza and noticed they served gluten free pizza, so that sealed the deal for us! We checked in and they gave us a buzzer and an estimated wait time of 20 minutes. Just as we started to walk around, our buzzer went off. We were seated at a nice table where we could still people watch the Vegas scene inside the mall, yet still feel somewhat removed from the hustle and bustle and the noise. We ordered a fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil appetizer that was just ok. The tomatoes were so underripe that none of us could eat them, but the mozzarella was good. Our pizza came shortly after the appetizer and it looked delicious. We all had taken a few bites when disaster struck- on our large pizza, there was a 10 inch (no exaggeration) dark hair baked in with all the toppings. It took a while to get the attention of a server, our server had moved to bartender and no one came back to check on us. When we were finally able to flag someone down, she was appalled and offered to make a new pizza. We waited 20 minutes and by that time we were just ready to leave. They didn't charge for the large pizza and gave us the new one in a to go box. These things happen in the food industry and though it tainted us for this experience, I would be willing to give them another try the next time we visit Vegas.",

I wasn't blown away but I was pleased and full when I it was all said and done.  The location is also worth mentioning. The mall it's in has a casino just downstairs and a multitude of stores just a step away.",

Big difference. We had the pleasure of meeting the GM Mr. Mike Waters and our server Javier, who had been there since opening, was just unbelievably awesome! I forgot to snap a photo of the Quatroformagi Pizza and Oreo cheesecake, but take my word for it, phenomenal! They also make their own cheesecake in the restaraunt! Good place to dine with family and friends. We will certainly be back!",

We were disappointed at first, but that disappointment disappeared as I discovered Grimaldi's was at the Grand Canal Shops on our way back to the hotel.   I wasn't able to try the Grimaldi's when I was in NYC yet, so we rallied on over for one of my best NY style pizza experiences in my life for the following reasons 1) Ingredients were delicious 2) Marinara sauce was incredible 3) Bread was light, thin, and slightly crispy around the edges.  In a way, I'm glad Tacos El Gordo wasn't available or I wouldn't have had the time to check this place out.",

This place is open until 2am, so rejoice if you've finished clubbing by that time because this place will satisfy your hunger AND more.    If I had to compare it to the location in NY city, I'd say this place isn't as good (just a little bit less crisp), however, it is still one of THE best thin crust pizza places in the Westside of the United States.  There, I stamped it.    The crust here is crunchy, the cheese is packed with flavor, and the pepperoni + sausage is meat glory.  I suggest you don't order any veggies with it because it will just secrete water and ruin the pizza.  Keep it to these two toppings and you're in for a glorious treat.    5 stars all the way.",

The prices are reasonable too.  Tips: -Open till 2AM. - You can order special sauce w/ your pizza but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce is a bit too sweet; it actually drowns out the flavor of your toppings and makes everything taste the same.",

I guess they thought I was under 21. I guess I'll take it as a compliment? :)  HOW IT WORKS: 1. Choose a pizza size and type.  We got a large 18in. pizza with white garlic sauce: $18 2. Add desired toppings (about $2 each) We added pepperoni, sausage, and ham: $6  TOTAL COST:  $24 for a HUGE pizza which made for 8 slices and 4 happy people.   I'm not much of a pizza person, I'll eat the toppings/cheese, the crust and then throw the rest away (I know... such a waste) but I think the dough to toppings ratio is way too much for most pizzas. I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this satisfied my pizza cravings without leaving anything behind. One of the best thin crust pizzas I've ever had.  If you're dying to try the one in New York, I would say go to this one and check it out. Pretty comparable even though the one in NY is slightly better, probably because of the long line you have to wait in haha",

Greens were fresh and pretty, tomatoes  firm but sweet and the red onions and olives were in just the right amount. I ate 3 bowls :-) So my waistline was happy. We ordered the \"Don\" pizza which is sausage pepperoni and it is meant for 3 people with healthy appetites. It it not Northeast pizza because of the crust (Sorry guys!) but, it is one  of the best I've eaten. I just want a smidge more cheese.   Wait service was excellent, friendly, cute and attentive. They have the outdoor heaters  but they weren't working when we came. I am never cold but strangely so last night which is the only reason I even noticed. They are situated in front on a water fountain that has colored lights, very date nightish. Also very close to \"Tivoli Village\"",

The dough was so soggy and gross that we were gonna ask for the huge Asian pho spoons to spoon that gloop up. We also ordered a white pizza with artichokes and chicken. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The dough was not soggy like the other pizza. But it was equally as dry. So, I would say. This Vegas location was bad.

Me and my boyfriend have many good memories at this place. We have our usual pizza and always ask for one side pesto sauce (for me) and one side of their house tomato sauce (for him). I love Grimaldi's and appreciate their free pizza offered to you for your birthday. Hope to dine here again soon !",

After looking through 24/7 Vegas, we discovered that there was a NY Style pizza joint in The Palazzo.   We ordered a small (16\") cheese pizza, which contained six slices. Normally, my fiance is not a big pizza fan; she's usually full after one slice (i.e. loses her appetite). However, she enjoyed the pizza here; she ate half of it. Everything on the pizza worked, from the crust to the sauce to the cheese. I haven't been to their original, New York, location. But, the pizza here tasted similar to other pizza joints I ate at in New York.  Next time, we will try the white and/or pesto pizza.",

I enjoyed the other pizza a lot more.   overall I was very pleased with the quality of the pizza. thin crust and the toppings never fell off when you picked it up to eat. this is definitely our new go to place every time we go to Vegas!!!",

While in Vegas there's only two pizza places that I will eat at the first is secret pizza in the seconds is Grimaldi.   Grimaldi's is located in the Palazzo it can be a little tricky to get here it is at the end of the hotel and if anybody has been to the Venetian or the Palazzo they know that you need a map to navigate the entire property it's huge.   Me and my three friends we came here for dinner before we went out to hit the club. We called ahead of time to make reservations the girl at the reservation counter said that we didn't need reservations but I'm a Steffler want to comes to that stuff and I insisted that we had reservations. When we arrived I told the host that we had reservations for four and my last name and she seem to have no idea what I was talking about. But she said us promptly.   Our waiter was absolutely incredible he knew the entire menu by memory he had great recommendations and selections for us he also came back to fill our drinks up and water consistently I wish I could remember his name but he was fantastic.   Being from New York I am really really picky when it comes to Pizza. The atmosphere reminded me of home there was all these old New York signs on the wall and photos really cool. They did a good job replicating the store is close to the one in New Jersey. There's a huge fire oven in the middle of the location. The smell inside here is incredible.  So with Grimaldi's what we're talking about is a really thin crust pizza super crispy a sweeter tomato sauce and you get that wood coal-fired flavor with a little burn on the edge of a crossed in my opinion that makes the pizza that's the flavor is that Burnt crust  My buddy is from New Jersey and he wanted to get the white garlic pie. We started with the white garlic pie and then we also ordered a meat lovers pizza which had sausage pepperoni ham and bacon. The pizza was absolutely incredible. After eating both of the pizzas we decided to order a small calzone which a small calzone is probably the size of a large add any kind of pizzeria it's enough to feed four people. We just got a Ricota and ham . The calzone was excellent.   The nice thing about them all these is that the prices are insane. You can have a good taste for a meal that simple and does not break the bank for four people and that's what I think is special.   If anyone is from the East Coast and you're looking for a good solid pizza place from all these is definitely a top choice is it the same as the location in New Jersey no but they do their best interpretation to replicate it and you know what being 2000 miles away they do a pretty good job at it. I would recommend anybody to come here and eat I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Was in vegas for a few days leading up to the New Years and was looking to punch some carbs into the stomach after a long night of frolicking and drinking on the strip. Grimaldi's has been popping up all over the grid in the US but obviously is the Brooklyn establishment. It is a consistent experience and definitely a tasty one well worthy of their chains across the US. Was in the venetian and making the rounds around through the palazzo and remembered this joint was there and figured it would be the perfect meal to \"Carb up\". We showed up right at opening time and were seated immediately.   The server was friendly throughout the experience and was attentive to all of the items we needed. The restaurant itself has some seats on the \"patio\" which allows people to watch those walking around the casino and spots on the inside of the restaurant. The menu is broken into pizza (custom or specials), starters, desserts, and salads. Simple and classic dishes all around and for this trip decided to go with the Caprese salad and the Don which is their meat lovers pizza. The service as mentioned was quick and within minutes we had the Caprese salad. The portion is ginormous and obviously a simple dish with fresh basil mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette. It was perfectly refreshing and took off the guilt of knowing I was about to break my diet and ingest a ton of carbs. The don was not too far off and this thing is loaded with sausage, meatballs, and pepperoni. The crust is nice and flaky and this is the solid thin crust pizza style. There was a good amount of char from the coal oven and the ingredients were plentiful and of good quality.   All in all, a solid stop and you know the consistency to expect from a Grimaldis. This is certainly a welcome joint on the strip and one of my spots where i know I can carb up.",

Looking at all the positive reviews posted, I guess I ordered the wrong pizza. The bf and I ordered a pepperoni, bacon, and bellpepper pizza and a caesar salad. The crust/dough was probably the best part about the pizza. I usually love cheese, but this cheese was a bit thick and chewy. Anyone know what kind of cheese they use? And usually bacon makes everything better, but this bacon was not traditional breakfast bacon, but thicker pieces of meaty bacon. The caesar salad was a good size, but the dressing had a slightly bitter aftertaste and the croutons were just dried pieces of bread without any seasoning. Though the food was not the best, the server was nice and attentive.",

Suddenly on trips to various cities, I was surprised to see the brick and mortar locations popping up everywhere. I dont know why I am surprised to see it in Vegas- where all well known restaurants tend to franchise and take hold. While Grimaldi's was not on the official eating agenda, we were in Vegas on Easter and it was one of the only places on our side of the strip that was open.  I wish I was not hungover and having a very rough morning- I know this is delicious pizza and would have liked to enjoy it more. Instead, I chewed on the bland complimentary bread and took nibbles at my crust and some of the marinara sauce. It was proclaimed as amazing pizza by my friends, who fared the morning better than I. I remembered it as such, and since I think they did a great job in replicating the NYC original- here's 4 stars to those more sober memories of Grimaldi's!",

The pizza is fantastic, it's thin and crispy on the bottom, and deliciously cheesy on the top. Our service was great and everyone left with nothing but great things to say.",

    "text": "Welcome to Las Vegas, the land that time forgot or would like to. You're gonna need a breather from the progressive Hold'em tables, or flingin' quarters at the pole dancers, and you'll need to break bread somewhere. Why not break pizza dough?   As you know pizza opinions are highly subjective. Ask 20 people, \"Where's the best pie?\" and you will get 22 different answers. In Vegas maybe 35 answers.   This gilded pazzo palace of pizza in the Palazzo may be your answer. It's a perfect place to unstrap your 3 belly packs, both fanny packs, your selfie stick, bandolero of iPhones and garage door openers, your Blue Teeth, your own teeth and enjoy a house made pizza as big as a roulette wheel.   The Vibe: Its red checkered table cloths and a coal fired oven in a meager attempt to add some charm to a town that's charm lite. Who goes there? Anyone who's rapidly disposed of their disposable income at the Black Jack Tables before cocktail time.   The Staff: I want what our server took before his shift to make him so energetic and bubbly as Champagne. He was a cross between a UNLV Cheerleader and a long haul trucker takin' West Coast Turnarounds. You know the guy that makes coffee nervous? Our guy made that guy nervous. However, he was as good natured as a Lab Puppy and twice as friendly.   The Bar Program: Traditional B & W. A few drafts and a few wines and a full  bar if that's required. The house pushes the house Meritage. Mille Gradi (Sangiovese, Syrah, and Merlot. (Ask for the S and M at your own risk). Grimaldi's makes this stuff in Italy at least until there is a Trump tariff on it. Some said it was one click from salad dressing, some said it was was blended with sour dough starter, but for me it went down and stayed there. It is a very reasonable $35 per bottle and actually fine for your pizza.   The Chow: The Bruschetta Trio was a MEH-rinated Mushroom and Roasted Red Pepper version, next, a Jarred Artichoke with Olive Medley (courtesy of Kirkland), and finally, a classic sleepy Tomato and Basil (both out of season).   The Grimaldi's House Salad was everything that didn't get tossed onto a Garden Pizza the night before with a simple vinaigrette. Order this so you can look your internist in the eye and say you had something green with your Death Row meal.   The Caesar Salad on the other hand was manageable. The Romaine was fresh and not refreshed. The dressing was decent, but the croutons were only suitable as a bar nibble in a sleazoid Strip Club pandering to Army recruits.   The Pizza is what you came for, right? Order a few 23 inchers. What you order in Vegas may go home with you.   The Don (a meat lovers) was the pick of the litter. A crisp outer crust that drops off sharply as you close in on the center. It came with the troika of Meatballs, Pepperoni, and Sausage, house made Tomato Sauce, Mozzarell, and Parm from the green can. (God forgive them). Seeing as you have to call Uber to take you from your room to the reception desk in this hotel complex, it is convenient. Is it Mozza? No suh! Pizza Bianca? Nein, danke. But this pizza was the best of the bunch offered here.      Then there was the MEH-garita Pizza. This was Restaurant Supply Cheese on a cracker. Even though it was as big as an XL Whoopie Cushion, there weren't a whole lota whoopie with this one. Grab the waiter when he flies by and ask for three orders of Bacon and try it again.   The Pesto Special Order was scrambled. They pushed everything off the counter onto the next crust on the assembly line, fired it and delivered it. It was not what was requested, but we flexed and accepted it as is. The Pesto was more paste, oh, how can you muck that up? It's mindlessly easy to make. The Chewing Gum Chicken on top of it will give you something to do for hours. The rest of the mess was recycled Bruschetta. Forgettable.   In the end, Grimaldi's was a split decision between Grim and Aldi.",

We were submitted promptly. After looking over the menu we decided on a traditional pizza with a few extras. We were quite hungry but seemed to take a long time to get our pizza. And the restaurant wasn't that busy. Now maybe we should have ordered a more pizza but it was a good pizza. Not the best I have ever had but good. We also ordered the desert sample now that was very good. All in all it was a nice evening just a little pricey for what we ordered.",

We wished we got bigger than 12 inches for us 3 as we left hungry, but that's on us.  Note: my only critique is it is a bit pricey for the amount of food one gets.",

I have eaten here twice already and both times, the food and service have been great. On both times, we custom-made our own pizzas. You can opt for half toppings as well in case you plan to share with other people. A large pizza is enough to feed a party of 4. I have had the caprese salad both time with fresh, bright red tomatos and delicious mozzarella cheese. The spinach salad was also good when I tried it my recent visit.   I have not had to wait for a table as of yet. Their desserts I have heard many good things about but have not tried. The pizza and salad makes me full enough. The restaurant is located inside Palazzo by the shoppes. Will see me dining here more often",

    "text": "This is more like a 3.5* rating for food when compared with the Brooklyn Grimaldi's but the excellent service made me bump it up to 4. Went here for dinner on a recent trip to las vegas. This is located in the Venetian hotel, but is on the second floor (I think), and we took a while to find it. Better to ask for directions rather than roam around trying to find it yourself.   It is decorated a little differently from the NYC locations, but it has the traditional feel of an italian pizzeria. They also have sort of an outside seating as well, which gives a pseudo-patio feeling. They have some ny based props like subway signs hanging around, and is brightly lit. The place is reasonably large, but generally is pretty crowded. We saw a lot of families dining there.  It took us 20 minutes to be seated after getting there at 7 on a Saturday night, pretty reasonably for a weekend dinner. Once seated, service was prompt and attentive. Our server was very jolly and friendly. He made good conversation and suggestions.   We got a bottle of wine to share, and all the different bruschetta to start off. I really liked the mushroom one, but all of them were great. We got three different pizzas to share, one pepperoni, one chicken, and one vegetarian. All of them were really good, but again, not as good as its original locations.  The pizzas are huge. The smallest personal one can easily be shared by two, unless you've not eaten the entire day. The large pizzas are more suited for 5 people. We had to box much of our pizzas, which were useful the next morning.  The prices are very reasonable, and of excellent value here. Since portions are large, it's great to share.  Definitely recommend this to everyone for some great pizza and good atmosphere for dinner, if you want to avoid the fancy restaurants and bars, or are with family. It's not an intimate or classy place, but again, it's just an informal pizzeria.",

    "text": "We've been to the original pizzeria in Midtown Manhattan and the taste of the sauce and ingredients is just as good here.  We made a beeline to Grimaldi's here at the Palazzo after checking into our suite at the Venetian next door.  Our server Katey was a kick and awesome.  The Don pizza came out just the way we like it, crispy from the edge to the center, none of that floppy, soggy middle section.  Like our other favorite server Chris, Katey was attentive, personable and really genuine.  I'd gladly give this visit another 5 Stars for excellent pizza and fantastic service.  We came back the following night after the show for another Grimaldi's fix and this time the identical pizza was soggy in the middle and our server Arthur was very forgettable.  When you provide average service at best, don't top it off by leaving the bill and my credit card at the farthest possible spot on the table away from me Art.  I've owned businesses including a restaurant and know that my servers will be the last representative my customers would remember.  For decent, but not spectacular pizza crust and lack of personality from this server, I give this last visit 2 1/2 stars.    Consistency and feeling valued as a customer makes for repeat business in the service and food industry.  There's a Grimaldi's just across the boulevard in the Fashion Mall which I think we'll try next time instead. based on our last visit here at the Palazzo.   I'm sure since we're regulars at the Venetian we'll give this restaurant another shot someday, but it won't be in the evening and we'll be sure to ask for Chris or Katey!",

It was four average sized slices for each of us. VERY FLAVORFUL!   For a nice dine-in restaurant inside the Pallazo, our dinner only totalled to $23 with tax. Amazing food, service and location. I will probably come back every time I visit Vegas. :)",

Grimalidi is a decent pie but just doesn't have the authentic Italian magic which Otto has. The crust was doughy and dry, the cheese tasteless and clumpy, the sauce was fine. Lastly, the ambiance at Otto is much better than Grimaldi.  Prices are the same at both places, so no reason not to check out Otto",

My husband and I came here for a date night and ordered a half and half large pizza (leaving us with leftovers - but we're not super big eaters) and a large (meaning GIANT) delicious Caesar salad for us to split, and I ordered a crisp red sangria. The pizza has a perfect puff pastry taste that is light and fluffy. The mozzarella and tomato tastes so fresh and authentic, not like the shredded and canned stuff that is so prevalent. The manager even stopped by to ask how everything was tasting. The waitress went out of her way to help us. The ambiance is relaxing with vintage type Edison bulb chandeliers, calming music, and authentic Italian furnishings. We are very pleased with our experience.",

If you are visiting Vegas from a region that does not have a Grimald's, you would do well to fill your pizza craving here.

A gentlemen comes to our table and asks us how our pizza as; we inform him the pizza was still raw and not fully cooked. He apologizes as he just happened to be the owner (surprise). We pass on ordering any other menu items to replace the raw pizza. The bill comes to the table and we are charged for the raw pizza (big surprise). So the owner is present and sees the raw pizza and still charges us? Absolute last time I ever visited this establishment.",

We shared a small house salad which was a nice portion for two at $6 plus we added Genoa salami for $2 more. It was as fresh as it could be. We followed that with a meatball and jalapeno medium pizza which was a great size for two. Topping prices were very reasonable..just $2 each. And the mozzarella was fresh instead of the shredded kind. The service was great and fast.We were pleasantly surprised at how affordable this was for a great quality meal in the Palazzo shops. Maybe that's why it wasn't crowded at all. It's kind of tucked away yet really close to the Grand Canal shops in the Venetian. I will definitely try the one in Florida next time we're there.",

Since then I have been trying pizza everywhere I can near where I live in Southern California. I had yet to find anything good, or at least comparable to What I experienced in NYC. Enter Grimaldi's. Another coal fired oven pizza. I had hopes. It was a restaurant from the famed Grimaldis that is still sitting next the Brooklyn bridge. And guess what, this hit the mark. This is damn close to Lombardis, the second best pizza of my life, and a very close send at that. This place is amazing, great atmosphere, great food; the pizza, thin, crispy crust, sweet light sauce, fresh mozzarella, what else could you want?  Tried the Cannolis and they are not bad either. Overall, if you want a great New York Pizza without the commute f going cross country, this is it.",

We are from NYC, and I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur.  I've been to the original under the Brooklyn Bridge many times.  This is easily the best pizza I've ever had outside of the NYC area.  Both the Grimaldi's and Caesar salads were excellent, nice selection of bottled and draft beers.  Then the pizza arrived, the plain cheese pizza and the white pizza were both above average with an nice thin crispy crust.  Aside from the food the service was outstanding.  Prompt, attentive, helpful, etc.  I will definitely plan on returning next time I'm on the strip.",

I was with two other friends on my trip here, we all ordered individual pizzas.  My pizza came out with an imperfection in the pizza and was told I got another pizza to go for FREE! I thought what am I going to do with this pizza?  One of my other friend's also got a free pizza because theirs was too burnt.  So 2 free pies to go on my last night there. Note it was about 10pm or so and I was leaving in the morning, kind of a waste of pizza.  Saw a lot of pies going out that night for free, must have been those young guys making them!  My one friend got the small 500ml water which was purified from somewhere. Not as good as the cosmo water!  Try this place out if you like flat pizza and free pizza.",

    "text": "Short: Overpriced, nothing special pizza. You'll find better at Sam's Club or Costco.  Long:  For the most part, the pizza here is no better than what you'll find at Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Tasteless crust, cheap sauce, cheap and skimpy toppings with a tiny bit of cheese. There's only better quality control (how little quality there is) and better service. There's also no specialty pizzas here; just the same toppings you can get anywhere else, you just have to list out what you want. I was really hoping for a margarita pizza, but you won't find one here.  I'm a big pizza fan and I often make my own pizza. So when a friend of mine got a birthday deal to have one free pizza from this place, we visited. We arrived and was ushered over to a table. The waitress and waiters were nice, but a bit too courteous as every-other-minute they were checking on us. You don't need three waiters to refill water people.   We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. It took a while to come out, but not too long. When it arrived, we noticed the top was just swamped with juice and oil--this became a problem as the pizza became soggy after a few minutes (so I don't recommend ordering out).  The pizza... was acceptable. That's it. Me and my friend found ourselves piling on parmesan cheese and oregano to get some flavor out of the pizza because it didn't have much. Let me break it down:  Good pizza starts at the dough. The bread/crust on this pizza was dull and tasteless. After a while, half of it got soggy. The only good part was the end crust where the over charred it a bit. HOWEVER, this place is suppose to be coal-fired, right? Well, the bottom of the crust was no crispier or better cooked than elsewhere. It wasn't even thin enough to create a cracker-thin crust. I've had proper coal-fire pizza and this place is a joke compared to the real thing.   The sauce is a water-down, flavor-less tomato sauce.   The cheese they put on it, while are slices of mozzarella, are so thin that it doesn't melt nor does it spread out. It's just wavers of cheese that don't give the pizza any flavor.  The toppings are the next joke. The mushrooms were of good size (not the thin sliced version), but the sausage is the frozen/ball sausage every-other pizza joint uses. Nothing special, nothing unique. The same frozen sausage balls.  In the end, I don't recommend this place. I am dead honest about the Sam's Club and Costco thing; they make better pizza and sell it at half the price! HALF THE PRICE! This place is almost a joke after I list everything out, but it's certainly isn't bad. I didn't get sick, I didn't walk out unhappy, but surely I would be pissed if I had paid $20 for that pizza. The birthday deal is worth trying this place, though.",

    "text": "A NYC establishment in Vegas? Sounds familiar. There have been lots of different well known restaurants from all over setting up shop in Vegas. It's like the trendy thing to do now. But anyways having eaten at the OG Grimaldis in New York, I didn't have high expectations that it would nearly as good. It was semi busy for dinner so we just got a large pie to go. They don't offer any of the normal combos like pepperoni or meat lovers or veggie. It's all customizable pizzas or al la carte with you choosing the size and whatever toppings you want. There were 4 of us and we got a large as it's only 2 bucks more than a medium. There were about 10 huge slices so I think it's perfect for a group of 5. We had regular pizza with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese (included) with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni (extra). They said about 15-20 minutes but I believe we waited more like half an hour. Lame, could've walked around more versus waiting in front. But the pizza was hot and delicious. The cheese tasted fresh and was super gooey and each slice had lots of each of the toppings. Again, not as good as what I remember from NY but it hit the spot and it wasn't super pricey - pretty much on spot with what I paid on the east coast.",

    "text": "So, I went to Grimaldi's (DUMBO - BROOKLYN) in February 2013 after walking from Ground Zero all the way across the Brooklyn Bridge (I was hungry to say the least).  I'll spare you the details, but it was average at best - terrible service, tourist-trap kinda place.  Not horrible, but definitely not great.  Flash forward to July 2013 - Las Vegas.  I was looking for a killer pizza place in Vegas (staying at The Mirage) and decided to find it with a little help from my friends (yes, I saw LOVE and had Beatles music on my mind).  Yelp says, \"Grimaldi's.\"  Hmmm, do I try the place at the Aria (Five50) or give Grimaldi's another shot?  The Yelp reviews for Grimaldi's were too good to dismiss (and it was just across the street at the Palazzo).  Okay Grimaldi's, don't let me down.  Let's get right to the details...very nice atmosphere, outstanding pizza and excellent service!  Our waiter, Victor was amazing!  He recommended the pie, served us with a smile, was efficient, professional and just a very nice person.  Oh yeah, the meatball, ricotta and sweet red pepper pizza was out of this world!  Dang, what an awesome pizza-eating experience!  Grimaldi's Las Vegas IS the pizza place on The Strip!  Thank you Grimaldi's AND Victor (you were awesome!)  Can't wait to get back and do another meatball pizza...",

The crust was crispy yet chewy and soft inside. Also the sizes here run large so a small easily feeds two very generously. This won't be last visit!   Ps)a little Tabasco sauce on it never hurts!",

We ordered A cheese pizza and added ricotta & grilled chicken. The dough, sauce, cheese (especially the ricotta! The ricotta was outstanding!), & seasonings were top notch.  The chicken, however, was definitely packaged / not fresh. It didn't match with the delicious fresh ingredients that made up the rest of the pizza. The grilled chicken was honestly kind of creepy & gross. It didn't taste good & some pieces were squishy. It was definitely a little offensive. *This is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.*  Desert was also outstanding. We had the desert trio (you get to pick which 3, which I loved!) and got the caramel apple cheesecake, oreo cheesecake, and tiramisu. The cheesecakes are homemade and you can definitely tell. They were amazing. The tiramisu was so light & fluffy and tasted amazing as well.   Finally, our server Rachel was super friendly, happy, and very attentive. She was great, especially since we were seated all the way in the back, we didn't wait long for anything. She was also very honest about answering questions and I really appreciated that!",

The only thing to be careful of is that if you want to have the pizza split with different toppings on the two sides they charge you for one of the pizzas and then for the other side they charge you for each individual topping, which are like $2 each.  So not worth it and they don't make that super clear.  Otherwise our waiter was great and we loved the food!",

Do both sauces, white and red, but make sure you tell them to just do chunks of the red, not a full layer, then you'll taste the garlic part of the white pizza more! I know, I'm pretty picky about how my pizza is sauced, haha, but really, this was the best combo.. I don't think I would have liked it as much with only one sauce. All the ingredients tasted fresh, and for $2 per topping they better be fresh!!  Oreo Cheesecake (3.5 stars): Oreo is always amazing, but I liked the strawberry better.   Strawberry Cheesecake (4 stars): You could really taste fresh strawberry flavor.  Tiramisu (3 stars): I'd stick to the cheesecakes.   SERVICE (4 stars)  Our server was really nice but it took her a while to come check up on us and pick up the credit card. They get busy. Pizza takes a while to come out too. I asked if we could order our pizza so by the time we sat down it would be ready, but they wouldn't let us!  ATMOSPHERE (4 stars): In the Palazzo where the shops are, so it's nice to walk around, but their beeper doesn't have a wide range so you can't go far at all.",

Once we were seated our waiter came to take our drink orders immediately. Unfortunately I can not remember what his name was however he gave us great service and had an energetic personality (really funny).   We ended up ordering 4 bottles of a Chianti and 6 calzones' and 1 large pizza all with different toppings and or fillings. It was really nice how they have it were you can choose your ingredients off a list and add as much of what ingredient as you want. We are carnivores so we packed ours with meat.  It did take a little while for our order to reach our table, about 25 minutes however; we had multiple bottles of wine... we didn't mind a little wait!   When the food did reach our table it looked and smelled amazing. Upon biting in it tasted even better then it looked. You can tell it was fresh made straight from the oven. the crust had a nice crunch on the outside yet soft more fully inside texture. Overall taste of the food was great.  Are waiter would stop by the table every so often and check in on how the food was and would engage in small talk each time which we enjoyed.  After we were finished eating we still had a lot of late night plans yet were feeling a little sleepy after devouring all the delicious food. Our waiter overheard us talking about it and brought us all free coffee to help keep us up - and it sure did..  Overall we had a great experience here and if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again looking for some pizza we shall return",

The small salad, btw, was huge and easily accommodated the three of us.   Our server was very personable and helpful with ordering tips. At the end of the meal, when I was chatting with her, she informed us that Grimaldi's actually hired a chemist to augment Las Vegas water to the New York balance for the dough. All I can say is it was one of the top pizzas I have ever eaten! Wow!  So, we ordered a piece of Oreo cheesecake to go and just dug into it--got to say it was top notch, too!",

My brother and I went there for a large pie and cold drafts, also the person who told me the history. The place was busy at 5:30 pm they keep the menu simple to order we ordered a large with half jalapeno and pepperoni, I love the crust and the sauce too. It was delicious and had that traditional NY coal oven taste, I'm from New York but now a local, so yes I was impressed and heard they have a place in the fashion square mall a mile from my house! So when in the mall I won't just pass it by anymore I'll stop in for sure",

After 4 visits I can say the pizza crust is consistently mushy in the center and doesn't deliver the crisp first bite that makes me think the oven is not seasoned properly.   Service is fine and the ingredients are just as tasty as the other locations.  The dining room layout is a little odd because of the long corridor before the main dining room.",

I think there was probably one staff member for every 2-3 guests at the time. Our server put in the wrong order so we were sent a cheese pizza. We didn't have time for them to make another one, so just kept the cheese but he still charged us for both even though they got our order wrong. We didn't have time to dispute it since they were also slow with the check and on a tight timeline. Would not return.",

Conveniently located off Las Vegas Blvd in Venetian right up on second floor this place is definitely an easy go to lunch spot.  We got a 20 inch pizza and we each got 3 slices that were big! Pizza is light and fresh definitely not greasy or heavy. We got the bruschetta trio for an appetizer husband favorite was the olive medley i enjoyed the caprese kind.   They always have a great selection of local craft beer also.   Only negative is this time it took a little over an hour for our meal and we got there around 11:15 and it wasn't too busy at all.

Service was just meeting our needs and nothing special. It was more pricey than pizza by the slice. Overall the thin crust was good. Selections were just ok. Sauce we didn't write home about it. So if you are venturing out look for a little higher rating if you want great. This was just okay. Happy eating!",

The caprese was good, I've had better. The pizza was also good, it could have used more cheese. The calzone was great, I picked kalamata olives and mushrooms, and those ingredients delivered an amazing calzone. Very good calzone, no doubt about that. The space is very NY like, very cool place to hang out.",

Our server approached, introduced herself and asked our drink order.  Shortly after, she was back and we were ready to eat!  Two pepperoni pizzas, cheese pizza and wedge salad was our order.  The salad came first and was plenty for three people to share with a nice serving.  The pizza was next, hot and crispy.  Light on the sauce and heavy on the mozzarella- not shredded but melted in bits all over the pizza, mmmm!  We took leftovers for the plane, can't wait to eat again later for a snack.  Good pizza, good company, nice place for lunch.",

My family and I shared a Margarita Pizza and loved it! The crust wasn't too doughy like those at places like Pizza Hut/Dominos/etc. It was crispy, light, and tasty! The marinara sauce they use for their pizza isn't too overwhelming which made the pizza so easy to eat without getting tired of the taste.   They also had a strawberry puree drink that I'd recommend as well if you're planning to order a drink.  Definitely stopping by the next time I come back!",

Our waiter was cool, he was patient with us because we all couldn't decide what we wanted but he helped us along the way and maintained attentiveness.  We ordered 4 16\" pies and about 4 salads.  Everyone shared and it was definitely enough for us all.  The crust was light and crispy and tomato sauce nicely seasoned.  I always wondered about the ratio of how much tomato sauce to use on the crust.  Well, I'm not sure, but they had it down packed.  I had an all white pizza (my hubby ordered it) and a chicken, artichoke, and cheese one.  I loved how fresh the pizza were and loved the light crust!",

We were hungry, my foot had a blister so we decided to wait.  At the near 15 min mark (I checked since we had a cut off to walk up and go) a server rushed over and asked us if we were waiting on another person or something.  We told her no and she apologized a lot and said she was going to take our order right now if we were ready.  Awesome! Crisis averted.  I really wish I could remember her name.  Because she was fabulous.   The food was pretty good - it was pizza and good pizza for me.  She brought dough for my kid to occupy her time (she heard me tell her no to playing with my phone at the table) She even put her creation in the oven.  The salad was good, but they took it away before I could finish (accident and they brought me more)  It was a good time and good food.  They certainly tried at every turn to make up for issues right way and often without any of saying anything.   I don't know when I'll be back to Vegas, but its earned a space on the schedule for next time.",

Our most recent experience had us waiting for our one dish longer than people who arrived after us! We were done with our drinks by the time our calzone arrived, 30 + minutes after ordering it. After complaining, our waitress didn''t offer us anything, not even a free drink. we even had to ask for water. Service has been getting worse and worse there. Before this we had a waiter who took our money we paid for the check, stuck it in his pocket, and gave us change from his pocket. This same waiter argued with another waiter in front of our table about stealing tips. Food is always excellent....but this was our last time at this location!!",

Bartenders were friendly and very polite. Price extremely reasonable given this place is in the palazzo, amidst expensive restaurants.",

    "text": "Probably the best pizza I have ever had.  This location is in the Shoppes at the Palazzo/Venetian. Came here because of the great Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  How good is the pizza? I ordered a Caprese salad to start, and it was probably one of the worst Caprese salads I have ever had. Dry and chewy mozzarella, flavorless tomato, limp basil, weak olive oil. I order Caprese salads almost everywhere they are offered and this is in the bottom 2 or 3 I have ever eaten. But the pizza here is SO good that I am giving 5 stars anyway. That's how good it is.  It's a coal-fired brick oven, thin crust pizza. With dough made from water they truck across the country from New York just to make it authentic. We had a pizza with spicy sausage, pepperoni and sliced tomatoes, and it was epic. It was \"I want to go throw up in the bathroom like the Ancient Romans to make room for more of this pizza\" epic. It was \"if someone runs in and grabs the last piece of pizza off my plate, I am chasing him down and beating him to death with a chair\" epic.   Dammit, now I need more of it. Thanks, Yelp. Just writing this review has convinced me I need to make another trip for more.",

The marinara had the freshest tasting herbs The brick oven baked crust was perfectly crunchy. The toppings were heavily  placed on the pizza. Quality mozzarella cheese covered any void area of the pizza.   We also ordered a caesar salad. It was delicious as well.   Might just have to stay closer to Palazzo next time in Vegas. For added convenience of ordering this amazing pizza!!",

    "text": "Yay!! I finally got to try this place after seeing the original place in New York on all the travel and foodie shows!! I was excited to find out that there was a location on the west coast!!  Pizza here is a bit more pricey, but it is yummy. A personal 12 inch pizza is $9 and toppings are $2 each... and it doesn't matter what size you get! So for a small pizza, you don't get as much value with toppings. I had a personal with pepperoni and mushrooms which is $13 and $14 with tax. Not bad and it satisfied me.   Pizza is thin crust and oven baked. Very light and tasty. Since the pizza is thin, a personal will fill up a hungry person, if you are not too hungry, then it might be good for 2 people. I had left overs and ate it the next morning in my room and it still tasted good!!  The only thing I didn't like was that you can't charge to your room!! I was staying at the Venetian and I wanted my points!! Also, this is located on the Palazzo side of the shopping upstairs, like the end on the Palazzo side, so if you are staying at the Venetian, or like me in the Venezia tower, it can be a bit of a walk!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Large Pizza - Half Traditional / Half White with Garlic and Artichoke Hearts Dessert Trio - Sampler of Cannoli, Tiramisu, Bailey's Irish Cream Cheesecake  Vowing to use every free offering and comp sent to me for my Birthday it was finally on Saturday that I decided to venture into Grimaldi's Coal Oven Pizzeria at The Palazzo, and sporting a coupon that affords one free Large Pizza with one topping (up to $18) it was only after a bizarre incident at the front desk that I found seating in the restaurant's main room, a request specifically made in order to watch the pizza makers at work without being exposed to the two-tops dotting the shopping mall's faux-patio.  Having more than once been steered away from the Brooklyn Bridge original by New Yorkers whose palates I trust, it was just after 3:00 that I arrived at Grimaldi's front stand and first refusing a seat at the bar, then basically having to demand to not be seated out front despite the restaurant only being 1/8 full, it was at a small table of my choosing that I finally relaxed, a young woman named Angie who preferred to call me \"buddy\" throughout the stay providing obligatory service, though often letting me see the bottom of my water glass.  Undoubtedly pegging me a tourist, and likely also put-off by the coupon which must be presented prior to placing an order, suffice it to say that my small table was low-priority compared to those drinking wine and ordering appetizers around me, but amused enough bby action in the kitchen and Martin, Sinatra, etc soundtrack above it really wasn't too much a bother, the fifteen minute prep-time for my pie whizzing past and the resultant cracker-crisp disk landing before me with cheese still bubbling and crust lightly charred.  Obviously not the artisan pies offered by Neapolitan spots in town, but at the same time using quality ingredients including whole milk Mozzarella and their own signature sauces brought in direct from New York it should come as no surprise that the coal-oven crust is where Grimaldi's makes its mark, and with good blister, great chew, and just enough thickness to hold up to toppings without being sloppy the flavor profile of both halves was good, if not great - the red sauce trending a bit too sweet for my palate while the white was nicely tinged with garlic, the artichoke hearts a bit overpriced at $4 however, and in desperate need of salt or some marinade.  Boxing up two red slices, as well as two slices of white, and later donating them to a trio of guys with a sign indicating \"anything helps\" en route to Caesars', it seemed only fair to give desserts a try considering the complimentary pie, and with the fresh-piped cannoli far out-showing the soggy slop served at celebrated Carlo's Bakery just a few steps away it is unfortunate that neither the cocoa-heavy tiramisu or overly-sweetened cheesecake could ascend to such heights, the $10 trio a good enough deal for scaled down portions, though if left to do it again I'd simply invest the $4.50 in the plate of two-cannolis, and save the rest for somewhere else.  Better than many local purveyors of the \"New York Slice,\" and served up in splashy environs that clearly cost the restaurant high rent, there are simply far better places for pizza in Sin City than Grimaldi's - several even under the same roof.",

We ordered the Mediterranean small salad - super fresh and customized a small pizza with: artichoke hearts, jalapenos, black olives and bacon  Fyi - the toppings range from $2 - $3 each on top of the $14 price for a small pizza, but it was worth it!   Returned for salads at lunch yesterday and may hit this up once more for pizza before we leave tomorrow! Will definitely return whenever I'm in Vegas :)",

We added and it came with big chunks of bacon, black olives and artichokes-the small was PLENTY for two people with a slice left over so no need to spend more than that if you're just dining with a pal.   They had a peanut butter cup cheesecake on the menu that we just barely made it out alive without. We were so tempted but so full from the pizza. Next time, that cheesecake won't be so lucky.   They serve Diet Pepsi if you drink that junk- The cousin does much to my scolding and was delighted-as everywhere else we had been all weekend was Coke.

I've heard a great deal about Grimaldi's from Travel Channel and Food Network so I figured it would be worth a try.  By my waiter's recommendation, I ordered my personal sized pizza with Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushrooms.  And here's my work of art: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F115EmrX&s=ac2722821cd2f61c5c02e9df93e6aca70762226bf310f7a9df6b247db242a4f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/115EmrX</a> It's gonna sound very cliche but here it goes:  This was one damn good pizza!  Probably one of the best I've ever eaten!  From the moment my waiter brought it to my table, I seriously got giddy.  The aroma coming from the fresh cut meats and cheese was very amazing!  The crust, while crispy, still had a nice soft chew to it and had a nice rustic flavor to it.  But we all know in the end it's all about the toppings.  You can tell by the pic that everything was cut fresh and handmade.  And when I took that first bite, I was in pizza bliss =)  Very delicious!!  It was really handcrafted with a lot of love.  I'm glad that I decided to deviate from my itinerary and stop over to Grimaldi's.  Now I understand what all the hype was all about!  One of the best pizzas ever!  I'm definitely coming back again for another delicious pizza pie!  Fuhgeddaboudit!!",

The location at the Palazzo has a great staff and the food is always very good.  The restaurant is very open and spacious and they don't jam the tables together. They go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying the dining experience.    I always enjoy the annual birthday large one topping pizza. I also like how they offer to serve you your first slice of pizza.  Their desserts are awesome and homemade.  The entire staff seems to be entire is staff is super friendly and engaging.

But when I found that there was one here, I had to come. And they simulate the exact same settings found in NYC. The pH of the water is balanced to the same standards in NYC. The brick oven is also set at 800 degrees and of course the ingredients are comparable found there.  But this time around, there was no line...granted it was 1am on a random Sunday night, and there were just a few people at the bar and the dining area, and I was hungry so I had to get me some of this fine pizza.  Screw the personal size 12\" pizza. I went for their \"small\" which is 16\". And within 30 minutes I had no problem eating the whole thing. The whole thing...and all by myself.  It was that good. I'm glad I got to experience it. And of course I would do this again. They have a wine list. You can choose to eat out in the patio, at the bar or in their pretty big dining area.",

I could tell they use great and fresh ingredients but the textures and sogginess was killing me. The crust was great though, and the best part.

    "text": "This review is only for take-out, as I've enjoyed their take-out 10+ times, but have never eaten in the restaurant.  If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would, without question, but I just can't quite go to 4 stars.    The pizza is always good and made when you order.  The made to order part is outstanding, but, it always seems to take way longer than it should to prepare a pizza. The service, while friendly, has also always been a bit too casual and not entirely focused on the service part.  Now, we have only ever ordered from them late in the evening (Go figure, late night pizza in Vegas! Shocking!), so they're probably thinking about closing duties, but still.  The bar area where you order and wait maybe seats 7 people' it shouldn't be that hard to get some more water or order another beer.  The other thing that really prevents me from going up another star is the pricing.  It just seems absurd to pay anywhere from $2-$4 for toppings, on top of a small pizza already being $14.  Some of the pricing also just seems weird; sausage is $2 but jalapenos are $4? A jalapeno that is, at most, $1.00 in the store (if it's organic!)?   Jim G. and I aren't even supposed to be eating these carbs, so this shouldn't even be an issue.  I hope, for my own sake, that I don't get sucked in to eating this too many more times.  However, when I do, at least I know that the pizza will be fresh and it will be good.  But I also know that it will take too long and cost more than it should.",

Admittedly, the dough isn't as good as it is in Nyc or Brooklyn due to the water probably but the overall flavor is the same. They give you tons of topping, and offer more upscale ambiance than their super low key vibe in New York locations.   Their desserts are also amazing if you still have stomach for it afterwards. I highly recommend their New York Cheesecake. That would make your day for sure.",

I was worried it would be food court garbage like (I assume) Di Fara's (at Caesars Palace) is. Pretty much the opposite of food court garbage, this place is sit down and actually has a nicer ambiance than the original, though I still missed the original Grimaldi's collection of signed photos of dubious \"celebrities\" over the years.  Also, just like our trip to the Brooklyn mothership, my daughter was a big cranky pants and wanted to go to the bathroom just as the pizza arrived.   Skip the trio of bruschettas. They were really in need of olive oil, a spread, or some kind of sauce because they were so dry the ingredients just fell off. The mushrooms with garlic had way too much raw garlic. The artichokes were okay as were the tomatoes with parmesan. All I could think of was the bruschetta I make is better.  The pizza was the star of the show. It was Uh. Maze. Ing. They use fresh mozz, and the tomato sauce is nicely sweet.

We decided to give it a try, OMG, it was a mouth watering experience!!  They are originally from Brooklyn and they make their own mozzarella, that is one of the best things about this pizza - top that with the best sauce and crust and making it in a coal brick oven - Grimaldi's has the best pizza either of us have ever had - HANDS DOWN!    We paired our pizza with a red blend wine.  We couldn't decide which one but I knew I wanted it to be from Italy to go with the whole Italiano theme.  We asked our server, Victor, he said both are good but his favorite was called \"Available\", one of the ones we had chosen...odd name but excellent choice!  He asked if we'd like to try both since we were ordering a bottle, he wanted us to try before we buy, what a nice option!    There was nothing about our pizza that could have made it any better than it was.  The mozzarella was a standout for me because I could tell it was fresh, the crust was thin and excellent and the sauce was so delicious.  Between the Italian ambiance, the pizza, the wine and our server, Victor, we both agreed that it was one of the best meals we have ever had in our 32 years together!",

We tried their BBQ chicken pizza (cilantro, red onions, grilled chicken and BBQ sauce) and Don Jon (full of meats- pepperoni, sausage) and their kale salad (lemon based vinaigrette).  Cocktails were delicious as well- the Limoncello Long Island and Strawberry Basil Martinis.   The service was okay. I have high standards because I used to manage my mom's two restaurants. So if I come across great service, I am a great tipper. However, the service wasn't bad and it wasn't great. It was average- like he was going through the motions but didn't really care for our answers. I can feel the insincerity. We had to ask for slices of lemons three times before somebody other than our server, brought them out. We had a baby with us and asked for additional napkins. We asked three times before he finally brought them out. He seemed annoyed by our requests. They weren't difficult ones just standard ones. I didn't like it at all. He did check on us and ask how everything is but didn't seem to stay long enough to really hear our answers. Like I said, no sincerity.  Hence, three stars. Good food but when I dine in at a sit down restaurant the service is equally part of the restaurant as well and I take that into consideration when I write my reviews.",

If you are on the email list, you will get an email a little before your birthday, which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza!   This essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!  I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!

    "text": "On a fairly recent trip to New York, I opted to try out Lombardi's instead of Grimaldi's. And while I can't comment on whether the Las Vegas location is exactly the same as the one in New York, from what I can tell, I think Grimaldi's is much better than Lombardi's.  Now I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl. Not that I hate thin crust, but I do not prefer it. Grimaldi's was still excellent in my eyes, and I would definitely come back given the option on a future Vegas trip. I really enjoyed the sausage as a topping, but I would stay away from the bacon, as it's a bit too salty.   Keep in mind when you come here that this is New York style pizza. It's thin crust, it's simple. I'm thinking that maybe some of the negative reviews here are grounded on unmatched expectations due to unfair or unrealistic standards.   Four girls split a large pizza and a large salad. Just the right amount of food.  Oh, keep in mind, if you want to do half-half on your pizza and have a certain topping on only half of your pizza, they will still charge you as if you had that topping on your ENTIRE pizza. In other words, if mushrooms cost \"X\" amount of dollars as a topping for your whole pizza, they will still charge you \"X\" amount of dollars to get mushrooms on only half your pizza. Kinda lame.  Inside decor was nice as well, with New York subway pictures and signs.  Located up on the second floor in the Grand Canal Shoppes! You might have to ask around for directions, since it wasn't on the maps yet when I was there.",

The thin crust was crunchy but you can still taste the dough. Sauce was not greasy and salty, it makes the pizza a little watery but overall was great. You can really taste the flavor of the pizza. If you want to relax and stay in your room. Just call and order for take out like we did :), you will enjoy it for sure.",

I had no idea they even had one in Vegas, so I was pretty excited to eat here since I loved their pizza when I had it New York.  But, it wasn't the same :(.  We ordered a small pizza to share for two people. I think the water they used really makes a difference in the dough, because it wasn't as good as what I had in NYC. The first slice was good, but after the pizza has been sitting there, it starts to get soggy and kinda gross at the bottom.   It's in a nice location (it's inside the Palazzo hotel right by the entrance of the hotel where the connecting overpass for the Wynn and Palazzo is), and if you get seated in the back of the restaurant, you'd have a pretty nice view of the Wynn and Encore hotels outside.They also incorporated some of the NY touches with the brick walls and subway signs inside, but pizza is still not the same as the real deal.",

    "text": "If you can't beat 'em join 'em.  Grimaldi's has been kicking the pepperoni out of all the strip fancy shmancy pizza places since they opened in Vegas a few years ago.  From it's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge (which I've been to), this New Yorker ain't gonna take no guff from some high end mega resort.  They are running the show and this isn't a diluted Grimaldi's Pizza, it's the real deal.    Located in the Shoppes at the Palazzo, now you don't have to venture off the strip for a Grimaldi's pizza (if you don't want to).  Prices actually seemed to be pretty close to other Grimaldi's locations.  Not to say this is a cheap pie, you get what you pay for and adding toppings gets expensive quick.  Problem is they are all so good, it's hard to not add them.  Went with Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Mushroom, Onion, Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, and fresh Basil.  My biggest complaint with Grimaldi's has always been the basil.  It just gets charred up in the coal fired oven and you lose the flavor of it as it's replaced with a burnt taste.  Lombardi's Pizza in New York adds the basil after the pie is cooked, so this time I had Grimaldi's do that and I liked it a lot better.  Perhaps there was too much basil on the pie and it would have been better shredded a little finer, but it still was a nice topping, and I recommend you order it that way.  Also don't dismiss the meatballs as a topping, they are really good and have lots of flavor.  The pepperoni and sausage provided some spice.  The cheese is fresh mozzarella and very rich.  I can assure you this will be one of the best pies you've had.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw#XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/grim...</a>  We also were very happy with our Caesar Salad.  Nothing super special, but tasty.  It's easy to go meal after meal in Vegas realizing you haven't eaten anything green in a while.  We ordered the large and it was plenty enough for 4 adults to share.  Considering how good their dough is, I'm very interested in trying a calzone on another trip.  Saw a few people eating them and they looked to be a good size.  If you are staying at the Palazzo, Grimaldi's will be hard to avoid since you will keep getting wafts of pizza in the hallways and elevators as people get it to go and head up to their rooms.",

He was rude when we ordered drinks, rude when we ordered food, and just an all around asshole. Getting drinks refilled was a chore. Our glasses were empty when he delivered our second pizza, he said he would be back with refills and never came back. He did however manage to get drinks and refills for the table next to us. Even after making eye contact, he did not come back until he was ready to drop the ticket. At this point, we again asked for drink refills, after OUR ENTIRE PIZZA WAS FINISHED, and he leaned across the entire table to refill, shoving his crotch into my mother's face so that she had to move out of the way. I guess it would have killed him to walk to the other side of the round table. We love the pizza, but there are plenty of locations where we aren't treated like we aren't wanted. My dad is a regular here and this specific location is (was) one of his favorite spots. We are all locals and have a high tolerance for bad service but this was some of the worst I have experienced. It was not at the height of the day, the restaurant was mostly empty as we opted to dine after the lunch rush. I don't care if Dustin was having a bad day, I shouldn't have been able to tell. He didn't offer to serve the first slice, which has happened at every grimaldi's I have been to, he didn't offer us fresh plates with the second pizza, which we usually decline, but is nice to be asked. I would have complained to management if I didn't think it would further spoil my father's favorite spot for him. We just wanted to leave. Absolutely horrible experience.",

She then says we are backed up in the kitchen. Again not that many people in the restaurant. I said ok let's just sit down and order and she then goes and says you can't bring the dog in here. I explain to her that this is a service dog and that she can come with me. She states that this is the rule here and she is aware of the federal laws. I ask to see a manager and tell her that she cannot supersede federal laws on this and she should educate herself or seek guidance from management. She continues to say no and I get frustrated to the point where i start to show my ailment under my shirt that shows my medical condition as to why I have a service dog. I tell her again to talk to her manager.  She comes back and says it's fine and takes us to our table. She said it's a long wait still to be served. The food came on time with out delay. I wish businesses would do a better job at understanding laws and I wouldn't have to show my condition to prove this is real and the dog has to be with. Poor service.",

Having been to the original Brooklyn location, having Grimaldi's within a two hour drive always calls for a visit every time we're in the Las Vegas area.        Since we discovered that Grimaldi's is here in Vegas, we've been to three of the four locations and have not been disappointed with the food or the service.       The pizza is as close as to what I remembered in New York. Like any pizza place, choose your favorites but definitely try the white with garlic pizza n your choice of toppings. Ricotta cheese is also a must.      If you're a thin crust lover, you'll love Grimaldi's.",

    "text": "So yummy! 5 stars alone for taste of the tomato, spinach, and ricotta pizza. Hands down delicious! Also had a bite of the regular pepperoni with mushroom and sausage, which was delicious too. The bacon topping was a bit too salty for my taste, but a lot of my friends seemed to enjoy that too. If you like thin crust, NY style pizza, this place delivers.  However, minus two stars for the service. The server didn't do much in terms of taking our order. We were left alone for a while, so one of my girlfriends took initiative and just started writing down our orders with pen and paper. We literally just handed the server our pre-written orders. Lame. Second, when it was time for clean up, the server was trying to dump half eaten pizza crusts on a bigger plate. Large pieces of crusts started falling off his precariously balanced plates right in front of me, but he didn't stop or say sorry. He simply picked up the dropped crusts and started dumping more on top of his growing pile. Eventually, large pieces of half-eaten crusts were falling ON MY LAP. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! It wasn't until I said, \"Can you please stop that now?\" that he did. No apologies. Just left.  As someone who grew up working in a restaurant, this was 1) disgusting and 2) rude.  Yes, sometimes you drop things when clearing the tables. Yes, sometimes accidents happen. But you always give a courtesy \"sorry\" to the customer if you're dropping shit everywhere, and you STOP if your hands are getting too full. Come back a second time so you don't drop food ON TOP OF THE CUSTOMER.   I'd even cut them some slack it was super busy and the servers were running around, but there were no more than 5-6 tables at the time being served. Awful. I wish I could have given this place 5 stars because we really did enjoy the pizza. The service though? 1 star.",

And I also really liked that they gave a little piece of pizza dough for our two year old to play with while we waited for our pizza to come out.

Toppings are minimum 2 dollars each. So the price spikes pretty fast. On the other hand a large pizza is enough to fill four people.  Some argue that this is the best pizza they've ever had.

I had the caprese salad, Brooklyn Bridge pizza, and a glass of the Lupino Pinot Grigio. The pizza was hands down amazing! Totally legit Italian-I lived in Florence for a while. I added a bit of crushed pepper, but great taste-crispy bottom and warm gooey top. The wine was good-plus came during happy hour so it was $2 off. The caprese was alright, but I wouldn't recommend because it had regular old tomatoes and real caprese should be made with Roma since there's a lot less seeds. Would come back again.",

I cannot tell you how many people stopped me on my way back to the room demanding to know where I got the delicious-smelling pizza and if it's too late to get one themselves. Alas poor sirs and madams,YES it was too late for them because Grimaldi's had just closed.  Don't make the same mistake and consider making the long trek down to Secret Pizza at the Cosmo in desperate pizza envy. Call in your Grimaldi's order because it takes 20 minutes to bake in their brick oven.   The thin new-york style crust is just chewy and crispy enough. The toppings are fresh & delicious. The service was friendly and fast. I can't make a single complaint.  Comparison to the original Grimaldi's in NY: It doesn't quite live up to the high standards of the original but still delicious nevertheless. If you go with realistic expectations, you won't be disappointed.  Large pizza = $16 Each topping = +$2 Special toppings = +$4 (i.e. artichokes)  Total for a sausage, mushroom & onion pizza: ~$23 (including tax)",

    "text": "This is pretty close to four stars. It's better than Spago, but I don't think it's 4. However, it's an absolute STEAL considering it's in Las Vegas. Three of their large pizzas, each with multiple toppings, only ran us about $70. That's crazy - it's a ton of food, fed 7 with some left over, and during the opening weekend of the NCAA tournament, it was a great way to lounge in the room and get fat while screaming at the television. Just too bad it's a bit of a walk from the Venetian and Venezia towers.  We had a pepperoni and mushroom, an Italian sausage and roasted red pepper, and a white pizza with pesto. All were good, with chewy crust and plentiful toppings. I liked their red sauce, and the white pizza was good, although heavy on the garlic. They did list garlic specifically, so I'm not blaming them, but it's not my thing, as you may or may not know.  So if you need a take out meal to eat in the room? This is great and almost thrifty option if you're staying in the Venetian/Palazzo.",

However the moment we sat down, the waiter was amazing, Cammy another waitress came over and delivered food and had a wonderful smile. Then all of sudden the Manager came over and she was told from other staff members that we were not treated well by the hostess. I was so impressed with the service we received, the apology, the waiter Daniel was amazing with his customer service the Manager who came over and to say she was sorry. I would have given them 1 star but the food was amazing; service was great and once we got through the welcoming from the hostess. It was worth it. Thank you for turning this experience around.

The food is almost exclusively salad/pizza/calzone, but it's all pretty reasonably priced. Even a 12\" pizza is a decent lunch for 2 people and is $20. We got the Brooklyn Bridge, which has roasted red peppers, ricotta cheese, and sausage. It was a winning combination! The crust had a nice crispiness to it and loaded with flavor.  The service was good too. The waiter said \"the Don\" which looks like a pizza any meat lover would devour, was the most popular, and it was tempting. He also gave me a to-go cup of water which was nice compared to buying water in the casino. He even served us up the first two slices, which was not as good for my picture taking, but nice for service.  I liked it enough to look up their NYC location. Spoilers, they don't have one. They do have a lot more locations than I expected, so I'd definitely come back to one of those if I come across them.",

Once I arrived I was greeted immediately by the staff. Fortunately for me things were pretty slow around the location and I was seated and given a menu instantly. This Grimaldi's has pretty much the same selection as most locations although I noticed the prices were a little higher than normal. (Its a casino this should be expected.) I decided to have the black olive and mushroom 12\"calzone. Truth be told it was a little disappointing, the cheesy was a weird oozy gooey texture that made my meal much less enjoyable but I mostly blame this on the veggie toppings I ordered. Next time I'll just stick to the classics and get a regular pizza",

You can choose from several pizza options on the menu, or you can customize your own. We went with a meaty combination of sausage, pepperoni, tomatoes, and olives, and it was fairly decent. The toppings were reasonably generous while the crust was somewhat spongy, which from my experience living in NYC is typical of pizza there. There are lots of shareable apps, salads, and desserts to choose from too.  This outlet is open from just before lunch until at least midnight every day. During the mid-afternoon, it's rather quiet, so it's a decent choice for a meal at that time if you've barely woken up all hung over from the night before. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas...",

The other location at the Fashion Show has disappointed me once, but not this one.",

The location is great - upstairs in the Palazzo.  But my highest praise is really for the pizza, since it is truly amazing!  My husband and I split a small (16\"), with half kalamata and half pepperoni. They gave way more generous toppings than expected, to where there were multiple olives in each bite. The crust was thin, but still a little thicker than traditional fast food pizza chains (which I liked), and the crust was crispy yet still had a little bit of soft chewiness (my perfect combo).  Definitely would come here again, hands down.",

Wasn't expecting much given its Vegas and I had the WORST FISH AND CHIPS EVER that afternoon. Having assumed mediocrity I was pleasantly surprised and have to admit it might be the BEST pizza I've EVER had with outstanding service in the bar area (at ground level). Nicely done!

We ordered a small caesar salad which was enough for the 2 of us to share. The leaves were crisp and the dressing was awesome..not overflooding the salad.. it was just right!   We chose the Margherita pizza (requested it well done) which comes with basil and tomato, mozzarella cheese and excellent tomato sauce and we added 3 toppings to it...spinach, mushrooms and roasted red peppers, and all I can say is we can't wait to go back to that place again for the same pizza.",

If you're looking for a casual, very reasonably priced lunch on the strip in a spacious setting-this place is it! we ordered a large pizza to share with basil and their spicy chicken sausage. It was plenty of food and both toppings were delicious. The spicy chicken really had a kick so beware if you aren't a spice type of person!   The decorations are super cute: there are subway signs, a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge and the walls are brick. The table clothes are also your typical red and white checkered ones that you see in many New York pizzerias so it really does remind you of pizza joints back in the Big Apple. The service was super friendly.   I'm inspired now to try the real deal in Brooklyn! But it certainly seems like this location does a fantastic job.",

That could be the hunger talking or the fact that he just really appreciates a good pie, but I will agree this place was pretty good.  It's a bit out of the way at the end of the Grand Canal shops in the Palazzo but it makes it a quieter place to chill out after walking the shops. When we went around 1 it was not busy at all. My husband got a cheese pizza with bacon and I got the 4 cheese pizza. The combination of the cheeses was so incredibly delicious that my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Even my husband's pizza tasted good and I'm not a big fan of red sauce (which it had a lot of). We would definitely come back here (the pesto pizza was calling my name as well), but next time we'd share a pizza or order smaller sizes because we got carried away and barely had room for dinner.",

I think what was most surprising about our visit here was that the prices on the menu were identical to the one on Eastern! Wow!No Mark up for being on the strip?? That's a refreshing change!  As usual, the food was excellent! We ordered a large pie with grilled chicken, italian sausage, and pepperoni. YUM! It was just as good as the location on Eastern!   I think the biggest difference we noticed between here and the Eastern location and this spot was the service. Don't get me wrong, the service at Eastern is great...but the service here was exemplary! Just about as good as it gets! I believe our servers name was JP and he was great!  In fact we were so impressed with our experience here, we decided that we will make the extra effort and drive to come to this location in the future! Great service, great food, with great ambiance!   So this seems like a foregone conclusion, but I have to give it..  5 stars! We will be back!",

I consider myself a bit of a pizza critic, lol We had had the \"secrect pizza\" in Vegas the night before. All I can say is \"what a joke\"! Grimaldi's was so good and I can not wait to go back. Service was also great. The manager(I forgot his name) came over and told us the story of Grimaldi's. He was super nice and came back to see how we liked everything. I told him it was amazing and I promised him I would write this review because I was so impressed.",

The tomato sauce was stellar - it had a wonderful balance of savory, sweetness and acidity.  The crust has both bite and chew, a hint of natural sweetness and serious flavor.  Outstanding food and unusually good service.  To end the meal, you have to get the cheescake. Thumbs up.",

The small pizza is enough for two. You sort of get to build your own pizza, pick the toppings of your choice. I had pepperoni, mushroom, bell pepper, meatball, and black olives on my pizza. I like how the pizza was thin crust, those are the best plus the pepperonis are small. Two draft beers selected off the menu, Fat Tire and Blue Moon. I'd definitely come back again for the pizza !!!!",

Unfortunately it was not as good as we remembered it and neither myself, my husband or my mother would return.  The pizza was just so-so, nothing special.  I love thin crust New York style pizza but the sauce was skimpy and overall, the pizza just didn't have enough flavor.  My husband is not very picky when it comes to pizza so I was surprised that he didn't like it either.  My mom got her own pizza and doesn't like a lot of sauce but commented that it appeared as though her pizza had no sauce.  Perhaps they were just having an \"off\" night as all restaurants do from time to time but we simply weren't impressed.",

First, the place is hard to find! It's all the way in the back corner of the Shops of the Palazzio. It's not a place you can stumble upon.. you have to go actively looking for it. We came for lunch on a Sunday and the place was empty. The atmosphere is great, space is ample and relatively clean-- great place for larger parties. The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and very thorough when taking our order.   The pizza was ok, not as amazing as I expected it to be. The tomato sauce was watered down and the pizza crust was really soggy, making it really hard to eat. The calzones on the other hand were delicious-- stuffed with toppings w/ a side of marinara for dipping.   Not sure if I'll be back, as it's not in the most convent location and the pizza is eh ok. I'm a huge pizza nut though, so if I don't find a better pizza joint on the strip, I'll be more than willing to give Grimaldi's a second try.",

The prices here are what you might expect from Vegas, although compared to the other restaurants around this particular location (between the Venetian and Palazzo), Grimaldi's is cheaper.

There was NO wait when we went around 2pm for lunch on a Sunday. Lots of space with a bar. I couldn't bring my fat tuesday in but they were kind enough to store it in the fridge for me.   So we ordered a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. Very tasty and good upon the first bite! We asked for the garlic powder and added to our pizza which made it taste a little better, but the garlic powder wasn't as strong as what we had in NY. I have to agree that the pizza was delicious, but it wasn't as good as what we had in Brooklyn's for some reason. It took about 20minutes for the pizza to come out. We also ordered a personal size pizza with white sauce. I didn't taste it but my friends did and agreed it wasn't as good as the regular pizza.   The service was okay, the server could put a smile on his face at least. I heard the less toppings you put, the better. Don't overload your pizza! I recommend regular pizza with tomato sauce with basil. A side story: my bf left his credit card here but they were kind enough to keep it until we picked it up. Thanks! 4 stars for excellent pizza and no wait! I highly recommend this spot if you're craving NY style pizzas.",

My group ordered a large 18in. pizza with the following: Tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, kalamata olives, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers.  The hearty topping provided great flavors to the pizza; while the thin crust provided a great crunchy texture.  The way they baked the thin crust was well balanced. Portions of the crust were crunchy, while other portions were slightly softened by the moist topping.  Overall, a great casual pizzeria that is more than able to fulfill one's pizza cravings.",

    "text": "So this review is going to stand out- ahem.... okay carrying on.   We went to Grimaldi's our first night in Vegas this last weekend mostly because it was the only thing open by the time we got into Vegas.  I'll be the first to admit that a pizza joint is no place for someone with a gluten allergy. That being said, I am surprised at how many places provide gluten free pizza...but I don't expect it. I try to avoid being a pain in the you know what to servers so I generally call ahead or just avoid these places, but this night we had no choice so I expected to graze from the salad bar.   Now the skinny- We get there and I inform the server I'm gluten intolerant and ask if the salad dressings are gluten free. He simply responded- we don't have a gluten free menu. I acknowledge this and asked again if he could just have the kitchen check the back of their salad dressings to ensure they don't have gluten I'd be happy with their salad choices. He just repeated himself that they didn't have a gluten free menu and asked to take the orders of the other people at the table. I was so offended but at the same time I feel bad about my allergy so I just decided I wouldn't eat anything that night.   Had it not been for my friend who went up to the hostess and asked her to please make sure their balsamic was gluten free I'd have not eaten. I was able to have this so I ordered the Mediterranean salad with no dressing and my boyfriend and I shared this with oil and balsamic. My only compliment about this salad was that it was a good portion, but we both agreed it was pretty bad otherwise. Ingredients didn't seem fresh and it was just a run of the mill salad for 15 bucks. My boyfriend had some of the pizza our friends ordered and wasn't enticed by it.  Our friends did seem to enjoy their pizza and I do have to say the beers were pretty cheap as my boyfriend enjoyed a few of them to help get through the salad ;)   So, seems like everyone loves this place but unfortunately my experience with both service and food was very very Meh.",

    "text": "Terrific....Definately New York Style pizza! Perfect density crust with a slight char. Tangy sauce. Slighty oily cheese and savory pepperoni.  We only had time for a quick pizza at the bar but will come back for more soon. The service was good and actually explained to us how Grimaldis Vegas replicates the NYC water they use to make dough in the Vegas restaurant.  I know if I were staying in Palazzo or Venetian I'd be ordering alot of pizza to be brought up!",

    "text": "I've wanted to try Grimaldi's every time I've been in NYC, but never made the trek down to Brooklyn. I'm not sure how this compares to the original, but it's certainly one of the best pizza places now in Las Vegas. It's not the best or the cheapest pizzas I've ever eaten but it's probably one of the better pizzas I've eaten in Vegas (even sober, because yes, even cardboard, oily pizza tastes great at 4 am when you're drunk). It's on the expensive side and probably 50-70% more expensive than you should really be paying for pizza, but that's usually how it goes in Vegas.  I was sad that The Pizza Spot @ The Wynn closed, but this is way better and less greasy with a better selection of toppings. I've also eaten at the Secret Pizza spot (at the Cosmo), which is also good, especially if you only want a single slice, but it's definitely greasier and has limited toppings.  This is tucked away upstairs in the Palazzo and wasn't crowded at all when I came on a Sunday evening at 6 pm. I had a hard time deciding what to order as there were too many combinations of toppings to pick from (around 20: pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, extra basil) and 3 different sauces - the traditional tomato sauce, white garlic sauce, or pesto. I asked the server what was popular or good, and he was not very helpful (telling me he disliked garlic and that I had to decide on my own).  The way they price the pizza and toppings is odd. The personal pizza, 12 inches, is $9 for the base (just dough, tomato and cheese), and the small pizza is 16 inches and $14, and the large is 18 inches and $16. I don't know why they don't have a medium size, or why they didn't just make a small, medium and large - probably so the people dining solo didn't feel awkward for ordering an entire \"small\" pizza for just themselves. If you want the white with garlic, add on $1 or $2 depending on the size of the pizza. The price of the toppings is odd, either $2 (mushrooms, garlic, olives, spinach, ham, extra cheese, extra basil, italian sausage, meatballs) or $4 (sausage, sun dried tomatoes). I don't know why extra basil is the same price as italian sausage, why garlic or jalapenos are $2 each, and why sun-dried tomatoes are $4. Just close your eyes, order and know that your bill (like everything else in Vegas) will be expensive.  I got the italian sausage and mushroom personal pizza. I could have done with just half the pizza, but ended up eating it all (I figured I already had done a number on my body in Vegas, so why not just continue the bad decisions). The crust was delicious and thin, and not burnt. The tomato sauce was the right amount and it was not overly cheesy (the cheese also seemed fresh and high-quality), nor did they skimp on the toppings. All in all, once I started eating, I couldn't stop - it was delicious.  It wasn't the fastest pizza - from the time I ordered to when I got the pizza, it was probably 30 min or so. It was on the expensive side ($17 for a small pizza), but not outrageously priced for Vegas, and it was one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas. I'll definitely be back here next time I stay at Wynn or Encore and need some carbs to soak up the alcohol or a fairly-inexpensive casual meal. Come with at least 2 people so you don't have to eat an entire pizza by yourself.  You can also order pizza and pick it up, which is a nice option if you are too hungover to leave your room and have a nice friend who will come pick it up for you.",

The pizza cake out pretty quickly too. Pricing was fair. Service was amazing! The atmosphere was nice too!  We were able to watch the end of an NBA game while we waited on the bar TVs. The server was so sweet to our almost 2 year old who was way over being strapped in her high chair as we had just driven for 2 days to get to Vegas.  Our waitress brought pizza dough for her to play with which was a lot of fun!  The bathrooms were nice and clean too!  Definitely a recommendation for anyone in Vegas wanting phenomenal pizza!",

My husband, mother in law & I decided to try Grimaldi's after walking around the Palazzo in starvation.  It was the only restaurant without an hour wait, so pizza it was.  Our first time there, I got a calzone (the size of my head, by the way) & it was delicious.  My husband & his mother shared a buffalo chicken pizza and said it was one of the best pizzas they've ever had.  We also downed a pitcher of strong sangria.  That was fun.  During our next visit a few weeks later, I got a thin crust pepperoni pizza & ate the whole thing by myself!  We, of course, had more sangria.  Grimaldi's is now our go-to place when we need a pizza fix.  The only downfall is that it's so far away from our house!  We only ever go when we are headed near the strip.  I saw recently that another location opened in Tivoli Village, so we will have to check that one out too!",

Having been to the OG Grimaldi's in Brooklyn a couple years ago, I have to say the Vegas location does a pretty good job at emulating some of NY's finest slices of pizza.   Our group of 6 came on a Saturday afternoon, and were seated right away. Damon was very friendly and suggested right off the bat that we get a small salad to share and The Don (the restaurant's must-have pizza). Damon says Grimaldi's LV is known for their salad and pizza, which they meticulously make to perfection. We ended up ordering a small spinach gorgonzola salad and large The Don and a large pizza with pesto, artichoke, and mushrooms on it. The salad was delicious and the small size was a perfect sample size for our group of 6. The pizzas came out in about 15-20 min. The Don impressed everyone, as the crust was baked to perfection and the toppings were amazing. I was so taken aback by the explosion of flavor in the italian sausage. I would put those bad boys in any Italian dish, whether it be pizza, pasta, or a sub, and call it a day. Our custom built pesto pizza was solid as well, but definitely not as memorable as The Don.  Overall, Grimaldi's LV on its own is a solid 4 star establishment. Of course, it doesn't compare to Brooklyn's flagship. But hey, at least you don't have to wait an hour in line just to get in in Vegas. Great food, great service, a bar and tv's, can't go wrong here!",

This is the only Grimaldi's I've been to, so I can only speak for this location, but I enjoy the environment of this Grimaldi's.  My family and I were seated quickly and greeted friendly by the server. Unlike other pizza places like Sammy's Woodfire Pizza, they only serve pizza and salads, there are no other entrees, so be forewarned. I'm always a big fan of the normal pizzas, but they do have a white pizza that I heard was delicious as well. You order whatever additional toppings you want on your pizza for a certain price per topping on the whole or half of the pizza, adding each topping is the same price for both. In my opinion, the toppings could be a little cheaper since you are paying upwards of $18 for a large pizza and you can easily throw on three toppings and pay $25 for a pizza. The pizza itself is quite delicious though, so it's a nice treat once in a while. The pizzas are thin and can easily fall once you pick it up, so if you need to, use two hands or cut up the beginning portion with a fork until you get about halfway, where it is safe to pick up without falling. Our server that we had was really nice and was helpful to us to make our experience complete and amazing. This wouldn't be my everyday place to eat pizza, but this is a nice place to eat at every once I a while.",

Perfect thin crust New York pizza. The wait staff has always been friendly and fun, and the food is worth a 3.5 hour drive. Get a basic pizza and stop with all the California crap. Ranch dressing for a pizza? Please. Good beer, good salad, excellent pie. What more do you need?",

    "text": "I was spending a lovely weekend in Vegas with some friends. After a night of moderate drinking we woke up to a feeling of utter agony. Our drunken state had turned into a hangover of the melancholy variety. Not even the freshest melons of Las Vegas could tame this horrid feeling. But wait, perhaps a small glimmer of hope. In the early 15th century, The Italians, with their delightful ingenuity, discovered a cure for this absolute evil of feelings brought on by the mishaps of the previous evening. Pizza. Let me say that word again as the words tend to drop from my lips like a melted cheese slowly slides off the beautiful dough disc from whence it started. PIZZA.   We all decided to give Grimaldis pizza a chance to wow us. It is located inside the palazzo hotel and casino. If you find yourself having trouble finding the place, you could always ask any one of the friendly people sauntering around the casino pretending to look busy. Be warned, however, as the directions given will not put you at your destination due to the fact that these fine folks here at the palazzo haven't a clue as to where anything is, or even their current surroundings in general.   After traversing the second level, making our way through the parodies and disparaging mockery of the Italian culture, we finally made our way to the darkest corner where the pizza parlor resides. We approach the portly white gentleman behind the podium, and after a long awkward stare he asks how many of us there are. The four of us look at each other for a moment and respond with a stern \"four.\" After we established the amount of people that were standing in front of the dull young fellow, he then proceeded to inform us of news that we still to this day have never quite recovered from. Apparently, 4:00 pm pacific time is when this pizzeria begins their cleaning regimen. We were told that their ovens, of which the pizzas are prepared in, were being cleaned and would not be available for over an hour. This was the initial downfall of this establishment and, in my heated state of emotion, I was prepared to give a one star review for this folly. However, I remained diplomatic and decided to wait until I got the full experience.   We returned approximately 47 minutes later and much to my surprise, there was a new host. He sat us and told us he didn't know who our server would be, but someone would serve us. At this point an overwhelming wave of concern came over me. If the first two employees were showing this kind of incompetence, what could we expect with our server. Here is where things started to finally turn around...  Our affable waiter approached the table with an absolute jovial disposition. His friendly mannerisms were out shined only by his knowledge of the handful of items listed on the barren menu. The appetizers consisted of a variety of unsatisfying salads. We decided not to waste our time with such trivial cuisine and went straight to ordering our grease pies. Three of the four party members order 12\" personal pizzas. The fourth decided to go with a calzone. Each topping cost hundreds of pennies, however due to the fact we were currently residing in Vegas, we decided to splurge. I requested a pizza consisting or pepperoni and standard breakfast bacon. Food was exceptional. Taste buds were tickled to a heavenly state. After receiving our food, we did not see our waiter again.   As for some things I may have left out, I'd like to rate separately as follows:  Service: Mediocre at best, not much to see here in terms of quality. One friendly face and kooky demeanor out of a staff of twenty sub par employees was not a saving grace.   Decor & Ambiance: A tad blase for my tastes. Atmosphere left a lot to be desired.   Food quality & Taste: May have been the saving grace, at the very least preventing me from giving a less than reputable one star rating.   Overall experience: I'd prefer to rate a 2 1/2 stars for my overall experience, however it's an impossibility so I landed on a 3 star rating. Would only recommend if an absolute last resort or if a deranged captor is holding you at gunpoint and demands you feed him a lackluster slice of pizza.",

If you've ever lived in NYC, you'll wonder what the fuss is about.   If you've ever lived in Chicago, you'll complain that the pizza is paper thin.   They have pizza and beer, how can you go wrong - so long as the pizza is hot and the beer is cold, it's just fine.  They have TVs inside, they email coupons for your birthday if you sign up on the website, they aim to please.   You can't really go wrong.  If you think you're going to have life changing pizza inside fashion show mall, there's something wrong with you.",

The location in the Palazzo is spacious, clean, and friendly. Although there was only two of us, we opted for the large pizza since it was only $2 more and we figured we could eat the leftovers (if any) later on in the evening. I would highly recommend this as a great dining option while in Vegas, especially if you are around this area of the strip.  Also I highly recommend getting the fresh tomatoes on your pizza...they were amazing (maybe early girls?). Yum.",

My wife and I never had to wait for anything because our waiter was always checking up on us and bringing drinks when he noticed that we were getting low.  He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  The prices were reasonable, especially being in the Palazzo hotel.  The food was very good.  The toppings were fresh and quality ingredients. I've only had New York style pizza a few times.  It was in New York, but many years ago.  So I can't tell you how authentic it is.  The only reason it was not given 5 stars was because some of the dough was a touch overcooked.  It was still good and a non issue for us.  If you are looking for good pizza and a casual atmosphere, this is the place to go.",

The quality of the pizza was great and the price wasn't bad either.  I tried the cannoli for dessert and it was addicting.  I will definitely put this on my to do list for my next Vegas trip.  The only reason I deducted one star was for the service.  It was just OK.  There was no one else there because we were there so late and the bartender kept cleaning his glasses instead of refilling ours.  He came around eventually, but just took a little too long considering we were the only ones  at the place.  I think next time we'll get the pizza to go and eat it in the hotel.  Side note: we also tried Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan and I enjoyed the atmosphere there, but I still think that Grimaldi's pizza is a better tasting and better quality pizza.",

The decor was definitely nicer than NY location and the chandeliers made of wine bottles were beautiful! It was clean, nice and spacious. However the pizza was a disappointment. Nothing close to the original in NY!!!  Our crust was burnt (black edges) on almost half the pizza, but the dough was undercooked. Almost like a mushed hard pita. The sauce, pepperoni and sausage were all good, but I had ordered extra basil and I did NOT even taste ANY basil! The house salad was good, but the green olives were still raw and hard to bite into. Service was ok, but it was just a waste of stomach space considering vegas has so many other restaurants. If i'm going to eat Pizza, it has to be amazing. Not sure if we just got a bad batch, but if it's always served this way, then we will not be returning.",

The manager came to our table to apologize for the wait and told us the pizza was a little burned on bottom and they were remaking the pizza and he offered us a free desert. Which the cheesecake was delicious. When our pizza arrived it did not disappoint and was delicious. we appreciate that they take pride in making quality food. Definately will be back soon.

    "text": "In reading up on this place prior to going, I read that they actually hired a scientist that analyzed the water and they now make their pizzas with the same type of water as in Brooklyn.  And then we are talking to the young lady that seated us and she tells me that they change the coal in the oven twice a day.   How much more authentic and how much more can you care about your customers than that?  Absolutely outstanding place.  Loved their location (Palazzo Shoppes, LV Blvd. entrance), decor (light fixtures made from wine bottles), ambience, service and, most of all, their pizza. You walk in, are pleasantly welcomed and taken down a long hallway, passing smaller tables of patrons, to the main dining area. Ordered a small pizza with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes.  SOOO good!!  In fact, I love this place so much more than the Brooklyn location, though there is something to be said for standing on the sidewalk waiting to get in at the original.  And I thought the pizza was just better. Mabel was just a very pleasant, smiling and attentive waitress and was very patient with my wife's undecisiveness.  You can actually stand there and watch them make the pizza and shove it into the brick oven with their long pizza paddles, all burned and crusted.  Quite cool.  We also ordered a small dinner salad (that wasn't so small) with a dressing that was excellent.  We topped it all off with a superb Tiramisu.  Dang, that thing was good!  The only other pizza that I believe we like just as much or more is from Bottega Louie in downtown Los Angeles.  Either way, you can't go wrong.  If there was only one thing I didn't care for, was the price of the toppings. Four bucks each to add the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes.  BTW, they didn't take reservations for only two, so they told us to just walk right up and check in.  We got there around 6:30pm, perfect timing.  I shall be back.  Vegas, baby!!!",

However, if you are looking for an AMAZING experience for pizza make your way to the secret pizza place at the Cosmopolitan (hands downs totally worth it!!!) Girmaldi's is a sit down restaurant with plenty of seating and towards the back of the restaurant you can see them making your pizza. Our waitor was friendly. Prices are reasonable as they offer the traditional pizza with their special sauce (regular red sauce), white with garlic, and pesto. They have a variety of toppings to select from ($2-4/each). The dough was nice and chewy but the pizza itself was bland. We ordered a large half red half white with pepperoni, chicken, artichoke, and olives. Their salads were good and large portions, would definitely recommend splitting. Probably won't be seeing you again Grimaldi's.",

We went around 3 P.M., so it wasn't busy at all, which makes me wonder why we weren't receiving any service. In fact, it was pretty overstaffed (it was about one server per table), yet we received no service. No worries, I thought, the food will definitely be worth it since there was so much positive feedback! NOT! Disappointed again. First off, its a thin crust pizza, which means it really shouldn't take very long. Took over 40 minutes. It made me wonder how they would be able to handle it if the place was packed. Maybe it is just never packed..... Pizza was sub par. Cheese got rubbery after five minutes. The crust was burnt on many areas. I enjoy a little burn since it is stone oven, but this was excessive. The sausage was good though, but what is the point of a good tasting ingredient if the pizza as a whole tasted like garbage. I do not recommend this location at all and will not be returning any time soon.",

I order the white pizza without tomato sauce.",

    "text": "This was arguably my favorite part of my first Vegas visit.  My fiancee and I split a bottle of wine and a medium pie on a late night date.  My half was sausage and onion and hers just had onion as a topping.  The pizza was crisp in all the right places, without creating a bunch of crumbs when you took a bite, and soft in all the right places, without being chewy.  All the ingredients jumped out and were tasty.  What really made the experience was the service.  Granted, it was fairly late at night (is there such a thing as \"late\" in Vegas?) but the server was very attentive, kept our waters filled, made sure to check on us, and generally came across as a nice guy.  This was all made more impressive by the fact that he was also working the bar at the same time.  Another great part about the dining experience here is that it's fairly cheap dining.  The bottle of wine and medium pizza came in under $40 and a medium is definitely enough for 2 people, in case you were wondering.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is cool, with a classy brick decor with modern touch and vintage New York Black and White Framed Photos throughout the restaurant.  We Ordered 3 Large Salads (Antipasto, Mediterranean and Cesar Salad). All 3 of them were fresh was more then enough to feed everyone a fair amount. The Mediterranean salad was definitely the surprise winner of all the salads. Next came our two large pizzas (All Meat and then Pesto with Chicken) The all meat had killer flavor and the meats all mixed in perfectly.  The Pesto and Chicken was alittle to trendy for my taste, I'm all about meats on my pizza.  The portion size of the pizzas were generous and the price to feed all 9 of us was less than expected and totally reasonable.",

Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a welcome addition to the strip, with its affordable prices and authentic pizza pies you can't go wrong!  They have a simple menu and a great ambiance, it looks like a little slice of NY (but cleaner) right here in Vegas.  The menu is basically the toppings that you can choose from as well as the sauce (try not to go over 3 items on the pizza cause then the crust gets a little soggy), then they have a couple salads and of course cannolis and dessert to round out the menu for good measure.  Now the desserts/cannolis are really good, the salads, leave a bit to be desired.  The service that I have personally received has been pretty good, and of course the pizza itself is great!  So stop by and try out a few different types of pizza if you have a chance, and if you happen not to like it, guess what fuggetaboutit!",

Grimaldi's was hidden in a back corner and we almost missed it but the pizza smelled really good and I'm glad we stopped! We split a Caesar salad and a small pizza and it was plenty! The service was very attentive for any restaurant let alone a mall restaurant and faster than I expected for pizza. The salad was dressed perfectly. Honestly: it was awesome! After 2 days in Vegas it was exactly what I needed. Green, big, lemony, lots of parmesan, and crunchy. The pizza was made exactly how we ordered it. We loved the thin, chewy crust. I don't feel like it was burned at all. It held the toppings well. Fresh mushrooms, salty kalamata olives, spicy pepperoni, fresh-tasting cheese, sauce that wasn't from a can, and subtle Italian spices makes for a perfect pizza in my opinion. If we stay in the northern Strip area again next time we come I plan on eating here again!",

They tried to charge us for food we didn't get, and after asking to pay for just the drink we did get, when the check was dropped off, we were immediately asked to pay with cash or check when the check was dropped off. Mistakes happen in restaurants, but when it's your mistake, I expect not to be treated like someone who might dine and dash.

Dirty bar, which even after I asked to be wiped by the hostess, she said somebody will in a sec, even though she was doing nothing  at the time. We waited ten minutes to even be acknowledged, then another ten to be served water on the dirty bar. After 25 minutes of waiting for just our drink order to be taken, we left hungry and frustrated. I can't imagine what the service would have been like being busy! Management needs to train their staff.",

Our server, Victor, was very helpful in suggesting a pie for us. Sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers, fresh basil leaves, and jalapenos (just on her half). Nothing out of the ordinary. Just good ole fashioned pizza toppings.  The pie itself was great! Came out piping hot and it was very large, and I believe we ordered a small. We wound up boxing a few pieces that we couldn't eat, and helping out a man on the street. Karma.  Grimaldi's. Solving the world's hunger problem one slice at a time.",

In America's pizza capital, it was my favorite slice of pizza.    Grimaldi's is known for their spongy sweet crust from their coal ovens.  They also have some great tomato sauce.  They have 5 locations in Las Vegas.  Of the 3 locations I've been to, this yielded the best pizza.  The other reason to come here is that it's high quality food for a cheap price.  I got a nice glass of Peroni beer for $5 and my personal Pizza for $10.  I love to get my pizza with basil, garlic, and tomato.  You don't need anything else.  It's so good.",

The sauce especially... It wasn't heavy and pasty, it was fresh, tomato-ie and light. The coal fired pie was thin but cooked to perfection. But the sauce! It totally made the pizza. The only drawback was my wife and I ordered a small to share... And I wanted more   Please come to the San Gabriel Valley- Ca!",

Grimaldi's serves coal fire brick oven pizza and known for freshness including handmade mozzarella.  Located at the northern portion of the Palazzo, the restaurant was a bit dead with very few customers in the late afternoon. There was only two of us so I ordered a 16\" pizza. Pizza comes in 3 sizes and comes with red, white, or pesto sauce. For toppings, we decided to have pepperoni, meatballs, Italian sausage, and bacon.  The pizza came out piping hot. Overall, the pizza was good but not great by any means. You can definately taste the freshness of the mozarella, the good flavor of the sauce, and the quality of the meats were very good.  For two, we ate about 3/4 the pizza. Just the right serving which would be better for 3 since we overate some slices. Overall, service was just okay. Pizza was good but by no means wow'd me.",

It was a really good salad. -then my friend found a hair in hers. :/  We ordered a small half pesto/white pizza with chicken and artichokes and a small sausage and mushroom. I liked the pesto the best. The others were aiite... And they don't have ranch for your pizza because the chef thinks it destroys the taste of the pizza. I was not amazed or even really satisfied with the meal.  Our server was really nice though and the cook gave us a $5 gift card for the hair in the salad to use next time except we don't live near a restaurant so she said we could use it for that visit which was nice.

They were raving about this place and we were looking for a good place to grab a bite in the Venetian, so we went. We ordered a white pizza with artichoke hearts, jalapenos, spicy chicken sausage and onions. Each topping was an additional cost (there was no such option for 1 or 2 free toppings plus extra for any additional) so the pizza was a bit pricey but DAMN IT WAS GOOD. Well, it was a tad spicy for me so I had to pick off some of the jalapeno slices but mmm. The crust was light and airy and the combination of all the toppings was perfect. I don't normally go for white pizzas but I just may in the future.  Service was fast, which us five hungry girls very much appreciated.",

Upon being seated our waitress, Yadira was 100% knowledgeable and conveyed that to us and our family when we asked about ingredients and food preparation. If you have an allergy you know how important this is, nothing worse than a server who gives you the \"you should be ok\" answer.   Not only was the experience great but the pizza was fantastic! Two kids shared a 12\" and three adults shared a 16\". We probably could of gotten an 18\" or we should of gotten an appetizer.   I should also mention it was really busy and we received our meal in 15 minutes. Thin crust oven pizza is apparently pretty quick  Definitely recommend Grimaldi pizza",

    "text": "Been to Vegas 16 times but never ever eat pizza. So finally did some research and was happy of the TripAdvisor feedback for Grimaldis. Showed up late night mid-week. Place was petty dead but with so many options, I wasn't expecting a packed house.  Ordered the anti-pasta which instead of a mixed salad was all portioned perfectly on a plate. A little drizzle of oil and red wine vinegar made it worth the $14 price. Our pizza consisted of ricotta, sauce, red peppers, and sausage. I am not a huge fan of NY style pizza (like thick crust) but damnnnnn it was good. Can tell it was cooked over coals. Great flavorful crust, generous and delicious toppings. Was very happy with my pie and look forward to returning too. Service also stellar.",

Apparently server Tammy felt it was appropriate to take out her frustrations on her customers, specifically the Asian ones. She offered no apologies or acknowledgement that service was slow, but did successfully tell us that she had 12 OTHER tables to take care of. Read: she didn't care that we were unhappy and was quick to just hand us our bill. We had a show to catch but I still called out the manager to express my dissatisfaction. Not only did our food take forever, parties that seated after us received their food and requests before us, no one checked on us and even the food runner gave us attitude. We had empty cups and had to flag down service. What was really appalling was they had my mom get out of her seat and stand there while new customers walked through past our table. There was obviously not enough walking room since the tables were too close together on that side, but alternatively the hostess could have walked the customers around our table on the side with a wider pathway. So inconvenient and inconsiderate.   We were so so upset and management didn't provide anything to make us feel better about the situation. Zero tip.",

Well what else am I going to do? I was a tourist in N.Y. I try to make it to the Vegas location whenever I stay in Vegas. I normally take a box of pizza to go and just leave it in my room at the Palazzo. Sometimes cold pizzas taste so good (doesn't taste all greasy) when you're hungry at 11 PM.",

The pizza is New York style, meaning its thin and crispy.  The sizes are hearty so a personal can feed two people and a large can feed 3-4 guys.  Their pizzas all taste really fresh and are made to order... you can even watch the chef throw the pizza dough in the air.  Their salads are also really good and their small salads are definitely shareable.  The decor is a cross between an old school italian joint and a BJs restaurant.  Both times I've been here, the service has been great.    This place has earned a spot in my Vegas restaurant rotation.",

    "text": "Tell me if this is not wrong. Is what they did dishonest, unethical, lacking any sense of common decency? Or am I wrong?      And this is not about the money.      My wife and I were debating between a $21 \"The Don\"meat lovers pizza and a $19 garden pizza.       The waiter suggested half and half. One half meat lovers, one half garden. We agreed and ordered it. Remember, he made the suggestion. He never mentioned that they had an \"unusual\" way of doing their math.      Now, logic and common sense dictate that such a pizza should cost $20, right? Half of $21 and half of $19.  That's $10.50 plus $9.50 equals $20.00.      Or, $21 plus $19 equals 40, divided by 2, equals $20.       No two ways about it , right?      Well, here's what they put on my bill. The Don 12\".                   21.00      Left half. P.                       Black olives-PH.    2.00           Mushrooms-PH.    2.00           Onion red-PH.        2.00           Sliced tom-PH.      2.00      They charged me $29.00 for what should have been a $20.00 pizza.      They charged me for the higher priced pizza, both halves, plus they charged me individually for each item on the garden pizza side, for which they had already charged me $10.50. Basically, they charged me $10.50 for an empty half pizza. And then they charged me $8.00 for the ingredients that should have bee in the pizza to begin with.    Now, even by their twisted logic, if they charged me for \"adding\" items to the pizza, why didn't they deduct or credit me for removing the meats from it?       None of the staff mentioned that they were going to do what they did. In fact, they acted very nonchalantly when I confronted them, saying that this is what they always do. In other words, \"business as usual\".      After realizing how upset I was, the waiter said \"let me fix it\", which implies acknowledging that what they did was wrong. But why would he have to fix it? If they had done it correctly in the first place, there would be no need to fix it.      I had already paid. They had already ruined my meal. I wanted nothing more to do with them.       That was my experience at Grimaldi today. Let me know what you think.      By the way, I made a hard copy of the receipt.      They gave me a receipt on thermal paper.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas :)  My go-to here is their personal white pizza with garlic, half with pepperoni and mushrooms and the other half with sausage and mushrooms.  The total comes out to $16.  Add a small Caesar salad ($7), and you've got quite a filling and decently-priced meal for two people.  On my last visit, three of us girls ordered a large pizza - it was too much food and we ended up with some leftovers.  The food here is very tasty, and service pretty good, but sometimes the crust is too burnt and the utensils/table not always the cleanest.  Hence, the four stars instead of five for Grimaldi's.  Still, it's one of my go-to spots in Vegas to grab a bite to eat and has been since it opened in the Shoppes at Palazzo.",

    "text": "Yes, it was only 10:30am, but my alcohol-soaked brain was screaming, \"I need pizza!\" A quick Yelp Search directed me to Grimaldi's inside the Venetian Palazzo on the second floor.   Like a rookie, I donned sweat pants, a hoodie and a backpack and made my way into the Mecca of Vegas glitz and glamor. I'm pretty sure most people thought I was either lost or plotting to rob the place, but Grimaldi's still let me inside...  Ross, bartender extraordinaire, made my morning. He made sure I had an icy pint of delicious beer that never seemed to get warm or reach the bottom. His cocktails (yes, plural; don't judge) were also amazing, capped off with witty repartee. Strong enough that I didn't inhale them, but still didn't taste like jet fuel or a pending hangover.  Bomb ass pepperoni pizza. Thin crust with crispy edges, delicious sauce, fresh mozzarella and meats that tasted fresh from the butcher. Enough said.  There is full menu service at bar, which also has two TVs in plain sight, so you don't have to miss the game. Fun, funky, unique decor, including wine bottle chandeliers! Front and back indoor patios for people watching - a lot of Armani-clad Europeans kind of people-watching.  Grimaldi's is a very entertaining and satisfying little lunch spot! If you're lucky enough to sit at the bar with Ross, you may not want to leave.",

I'll shamefully admit though, my pizza alone was at least $20. Ridiculous, I'll never do it again and the only reason they got my money was because I had a nice buzz off some drinks my husband and I made back at our room because honestly, no way in hell would I have paid that sober.   Everyone was pretty happy with the exception of my sister-in-law. She ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. I think they got it twisted and gave her extra sauce instead. When we asked our server, he said that was extra cheese. She asked to speak to a manager and he said the same thing. Sorry, I'm not picky or anything but I wouldn't have accepted that as being extra cheese.   I'm an easy person to please so for someone to piss me off at a restaurant is pretty rare. I wish I would have gotten the girls name because her people skills need some work. I asked if I could get some ranch for my pizza (hello, Californian here!) and the girl straight up said, \"No, we don't have any.\" and trotted her happy a$$ away from the table. Nothing as far as a, \"No, sorry we don't carry ranch here.\" or anything in that format. Just basically a screw off and deal with it.   For $50 in pizza for 2, I expect more than that when asked a question honestly.",

    "text": "Last night, on my last review I shared my experience at a pizzeria that was ordinary at best. For this review I will leave Paris for Italy to share a pizzeria that makes me say, \"wow!\" Being this is the Las Vegas Strip, the distance from Paris to Italy is less than a mile.       Grimaldi's is a pizzeria chain that started in New York City. There original location is off Fulton Street under the Brooklyn Bridge (this place fits would fit in at NY-NY). Grimaldi's became so popular that it spread to different parts of the country. There are a few locations in Las Vegas. The neat thing about Grimaldi's is that their two locations on the Las Vegas Strip (the other one is in Fashion Show) are identical to the off-strip locations. Disparate from certain restaurants, Grimaldi's has stayed off the price - gouging bandwagon. Another neat thing is that I personally visited the original location. Well kind of. On the way to Atlantic City, my friend pulled up to Grimaldi's and took out a pie that was delicious road food on the drive. A few other times, he'd take out Grimaldi's. The fact that he lived in the middle of Long Island, a landscape where the pizzeria is the equivalent of the poker lounge in Vegas, and stopped at Grimaldi's when he was in the City is evidence that Grimaldi's is first-rate pizzeria. From these experiences, I attest to the fact that Grimaldi's is legitimate New York pizza instead of a pizzeria pretending to be.      Practically across the continent and a long ride across Interstate 15 and 80 to the George Washington Bridge this Grimaldi's sits in the shadow of canals, gondola boats, and St. Mark's Square. Just like the Brooklyn Bridge, this makes for an exciting spot to enjoy New York pizza that melts in your mouth and not in your hands.      The restaurant itself is impressive. It is a large space on the upper floor of the Palazzo Shops a coin throw from the pedestrian bridge leading to the Wynn. The upscale environment is a relaxing location to bite into New York pizza while listening to a soundtrack including Frank Sinatra. The impressive dining space extends from a patio overlooking the Palazzo Shops to Las Vegas Boulevard. There are several tables with red and white table cloths plus a bar underneath the dimly lit pizzeria. Many of the tables offer a unique Vista of the colossal chandelier hanging from the Palazzo Shops ceiling forming a wall at the restaurant elevation. Talk about elegance. Now I will talk about the pizza.       I respect Grimaldi's for having the decency to pass over taking advantage of being on the Las Vegas Strip. The prices are commendable. A small New York pizza pie featuring the coal oven cooked thin crust, melting mozzarella cheese, and out of this world Grimaldi's sauce is $9 before toppings. The menu offers a sundry of toppings including meatballs, pepperoni, bacon, and other choices. I cherish my pizza pie with mushrooms. The mushrooms, in similar style to numerous toppings adds $2 to the experience. And what an experience! Prior to the pizza pie, bread and butter is a tasty oman to meal ahead. With the pizza pie, I order a soda. After tip and tax, it comes out to less than $20 well spent.      At Grimaldi's, the staff is just like the pizza: pleasant. The servers have always been attentive and friendly. One of the servers I had for a few visits was extraordinary friendly. I remember asking him if they are opening anymore Grimaldi's. He enthusiastically said that they want to build one in northwest Las Vegas. That was a couple of years ago and has yet to happen. What does happen is that you feel appreciated here.      This review is a word picture that tells a True story that there is usually a Happy Ending dining at the Palazzo Grimaldi's. This positive word picture is one of the positive Grimaldi's accolades. The Food Network rated it as one of the five best pizzerias in the United States. Ziglats rated it as the best pizzeria in New York City. I will finish painting this word picture by saying that I recommend Grimaldi's.",

This comes a very close second to The Brooklyn branch-I'd say possibly the atmosphere and the area where the restaurant is located in Vegas isn't as good as New York and so this affects the meal itself-however the pizza was gorgeous and we had to order more pizza as we went along, we had 3 18inch pizzas between 6 of us in the end lol   The prices were reasonable and the wine was lovely! The service was a bit slow but the food was worth it in the end.  I would highly recommend trying Grimaldis if you ever find yourself in Brooklyn, and if in Vegas this is with a whirl as well!",

I don't have THAT much self control over my love for food.) However, I did think *really* hard about portion controlling my food during my first night.   That is, until we went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria for dinner. After the first bite into my pizza slice, I knew it was game over. I didn't care if I looked pudgy in my skin tight dress in a few hours. I NEEDED to shove more of this amazing pizza into my mouth!   (To be fair, we also ordered a salad to feel healthy. And it was a really good salad!)  Since I was with two Vegas n00bies, I was egging them on to start drinking before we ate. At first, they declined. But they gave in when our server came over and told them people who visit Vegas should be drunk all the time. I quickly nodded in agreement... and we ordered a carafe of white sangria. #win I do love fun servers who make my dining experience even more enjoyable!",

Every time I'm in Vegas this is a must have for me (4th time)  They were nice enough to give our boys a piece of dough to keep them busy while they pizza cooked.   Wow....Greatest idea ever!!   food: Don pizza it was delicious as usual.  The crust, the cheese, the marinara, pepperoni Holy cow... best ingredients used.   bruschetta trio We chose classic tomato and marinated artichoke and OMG!!!! It was sooo damn tasty!   I can't wait to go back.  If anyone knows how to recreate that marinated artichoke bruschetta , please send it my way!",

    "text": "The original Grimaldi's, nestled under the Brooklyn Bridge since 1990, has serious pizza heritage. Patsy Grimaldi mentored under Gennaro Lombardi, the grand-daddy of NY pizza, back in the early 20th Century, then went out on his own, first up in Harlem. Grimaldi built his rep on using coal-fired ovens to get a crispy burnt charcoal taste into the bottom of the crust. New Yorkers used to stand in line to get into Grimaldi's, as they took no reservations. Zagat once crowned it the best pizza in the city.  Alas, all that isn't going to mean very much with regard to your non-Brooklyn experience at a Grimaldi's Pizzeria.   I was excited at the possibilities that awaited, what with the combination of The Palazzo's commitment to upscale excellence with the Grimaldi's name. I fronted my pizza with a Caesar salad that I can say was tasty enough. However my loaded pie was pretty durn bland. And having eaten NY pizza ... since I was a kid in NY back-in-the-day from pizzerias where everyone working in the joint all spoke thick Italian and zero English ... I think I've earned the right to say that. Those pizzas didn't have crisped-up bottoms -- and you know what -- I prefer it soft, doughy and chewy, thank you very much. The top of the pizza also left much to be desired. Soggy, slippery-sloppy, too flippy-floppy, lacking those little drops of grease that bring on the flavor. I've had LOTS of NY-style pizza that I liked much more than this. In fact, I've had slices of pizza in the all-night food court area on The Venetian side of this property that was better. (Highway-robbery prices at 4am, a packed mob of drunk millennials chowing-down shoulder-to-shoulder, but still better pizza.) I felt like they had just turned a bunch of minnie-wage kids with zero oven experience loose in a Grimaldi's to try to figure out how to make pizza. When it was over, I toted my sad Grimaldi's pizza box back to the car and my fridge. Now keep in mind that even the worst pizza is, to co-opt a concept from Woody Allen, is still right-on-the-money. But I sure won't be back here for seconds.  The source of this mediocrity, I have now discovered, is that the Grimaldi family actually sold off their name and the business back in 1998 ... and the new owner has been working to turn Grimaldi's into a major franchise ever since. Want in? It'll cost you at least a cool million. Currently there's 13 Grimaldi franchises just in Vegas. One right across the street in the Fashion Show Mall. Yes, now we're talking shopping mall pizza here. And other franchises as far flung as Shanghai.   Put all of it together and it makes makes Grimaldi's sound a whole lot more like Papa John's  ... and a whole lot less like the wide-spread distribution of legendary NY pizza. Meanwhile the Grimaldi family, having long ago sold off their own name, are now running another pizzeria in Brooklyn named Juliana's Pizza, a joint that somehow has ties running back to the Lombardi family. THAT being where New Yorkers in-the-know stand in-line these days for their pizza. The tourists, apparently, line-up at Grimaldi's.  Given my experience and that history, I'd say don't buy into the legend of the Grimaldi brand - a legend that is truly no-more - and use your belly to gather up other Vegas culinary experiences instead. Some of which can be had right on The Venetian/Palazzo property.",

I ordered 16\" pizza: A half pizza with tomato, tomato sauce, mushrooms, black olives & pepperoni and the other half was margherita. The dough was chewy, and not cooked 100%. Tomato sauce was runny and had no flavor. I had to ask for salt to add flavor. By far the \"nastiest\" pizza I have ever tasted!   I should've sent it back, but I had eaten one slice. We came here because it was convenient, since we were staying at the Palazzo. I regretted it and will not come back.",

She had a coupon for a free pizza so we printed it out and presented it to them.  This was for one large pizza with one free topping!  Additional toppings range from $2-$5 depending on what you get.  We got pepperoni and mushrooms! yum!!  This large pizza is $16 and it is worth it, even if we didn't have a coupon.  I love thin pizzas so if you are not a fan and want more thickness, you may not like it.  They make these pizzas with fresh mozzarella cheese and you can see them make it through their glass windows. Andddd  i must say, this pizza was GINORMOUS!! We had to take 2 slices to go. We also ordered the Antipasto, which consisted of genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, oven-roasted sweet peppers, sicilian olives, and oven toasted crostini.  This was $9 for a regular size.  This was just an okay salad dish.  All this and only one basil leaf? :(  Overall, I love this place.  It is located in Venetian/Palazzo hotel.  Very nice decor and a great place for a date too!  I was so hungry later that night that I ate the leftovers...COLD and i must say, it was still delicious! Our server was super polite and very helpful too!  NOTE: -Sign up for email to get a free pizza on your birthday -MUST print out coupon and present (they do not take from phones)",

    "text": "We were wandering around the Venetian/Palazzo complex looking for a place to grab dinner. There are a ton of good options, but we were looking for something quick and relatively cheap. We almost settled for the food court inside the Grand Canal Shoppes ($10 ish dollars per person), but luckily we opted for something better.   Grimaldi's is located near the Wynn pedestrian bridge entrance to the Palazzo. It's on the upper level with Palazzo's shopping area. We were quickly seated in the main dining room, which had an open look into the pizza kitchen where you can see the cooks baking your coal fired pizzas. We ordered a large pizza (18\" - 8 slices) with Italian sausage and mushrooms. The pizza was very tasty - I particularly liked the flavorful sausage and the red sauce.   The large size is $16, with each additional topping ranging from $2-$4. We got one pizza with two toppings to share so our total bill came out to be around $21 without tip, which is less than we would have paid at the food court!!! Moral of this story: skip the food court and get some real food in a nice relaxed atmosphere at Grimaldi's!",

    "text": "I love Grimaldi's and I'm definitely a frequent flyer here whenever I crave for pizza. Fresh, extremely fresh pizza, made to order, and THIN crust. I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza!! Also for less than $20 you get a quality pizza!  I read that they bake their pizza using brick ovens, but with a special kind of coal called \"anthracite\" which is a more premium coal because it has a high carbon content and few impurities.   & since they originated in NYC and wanted to bring the same flavor to other cities, they do not use our water system here in the LV valley- instead they use the NYC water pumping system installed in every location to bring that flavor here.   First I will say, that the service at this location was a little below what I'm used to, normally get my pizza lightly cooked on the crust, because they normally bring it out a a little charred. I requested it but still got the charred crust. :(  If you like a little buttery crust, I recommend asking for it lightly cooked.   We order our pizza with basil (you can get it baked on top or after baking, so it's still \"raw,\" with pepperoni, and with italian sausage. Extra toppings of course cost a little more.   I haven't tried their desserts yet, since this location is in the palazzo, Bouchon bakery is soo close. So I ran right over there. :P  4/5 stars- because of the service at this location. Otherwise 5 stars for the awesomeness of the pizza!",

My friend and went shopping the next day and came upon another Grimaldi's at the big mall nearby. So we had it yet again.  Yup 2 days in a row. That location wasn't quite as good as this one at the Palazzo, but still great. This location however is stellar on quality.  I can't disagree with someone on taste, since it's subjective- but to the people that say they've had better pizza...for the love of god tell me where that is. No words, just go. Oh, and don't go all fancy. Just the pepperoni. Keep it nice and pure.",

We sat close the the oven and watched them spinning and tossing pizza. The wine selection was good as well. We opted for a lower end bottle($21) and were pleasantly surprised when it was good(it was Stella Merlot). To top everything off, our waitress was on point as well. All in all, this place was awesome! Give them a try if you haven't already",

Giolani or whatever his name is was the older server who looked he hated his life. When I asked him if he could reheat my pizza because it was cold, he just looked at me, kept walking, and shook his head yes. Waited another 5 minutes for him to come back and never saw him again.   So the FOOD...  we ordered the mediterranean salad which was delish! We ordered a large between two people and ate it all just fine with no struggle. I loved the sauce they used because it was your normal vinaigrette but it had a nice tangy sour kick to it!   Finally after 20 minutes we received the pizza because they had to clean the ovens in the middle of the day. It was only warm. I don't about you but I love my pizza burning the roof of my mouth when I take my first bite. By the time i went for my second slice it was cold.",

The starter large pizza was $18 and each topping was extra. There were tons of toppings anywhere between $2-$4. We were served our pizza within about 10 minutes which is fast for cooked to order. A large pizza was quite a bit for two people but we managed to eat all but two pieces which we took out for later. We also each got a soda and with tax it totalled up to $34.00 which is really great for two super stuffed people who won't need to eat again for hours.",

She also warned us that their portions are huge and are meant to be shared, family style. I really appreciated her advising us because when on vacation I hardly eat left overs and I hate wasting food.   My husband and I shared the small Mediterranean salad and small traditional pizza (toppings: ricotta cheese, pepperoni, sausage and jalepanos). Since it was early for us we decided not to drink any alcohol but I did check out their wine list and it is extensive and very reasonably priced.   I know Vegas is not cheap but this place is probably a great way to stretch your money and have high quality food.   Two thumbs up for Grimaldi's food and to our server Selina.",

First, the place wasn't really that busy, but my husband and I were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. 20 minutes later, we were seated. After taking our drink order, it took our waiter about another 20 minutes to get my one glass of wine to me. For dinner, we ordered one large pizza to share and a small salad for me. After 30 minutes, the waiter stopped by for the first time since dropping my wine off to get my husband's Pepsi refill, at which point he mentioned my salad to the waiter. He looked at his notepad, and replied with \"Oh, that's right. Sorry about that, I'll be right back.\" He completely forgot about it. About 10 minutes later, the waiter came to us to tell us the kitchen staff burned our pizza, so we'd have to wait another 10-15 minutes to allow them to finish the second pizza. My salad was better than the pizza. I don't know what all the hype is because I've had better frozen pizzas than what they made. To top it all off, it was half-price Tuesday, and we were charged full price for my glass of wine. My second worst restaurant service experience of all time.",

My husband is crazy about Grimaldi's, and was impressed by this location. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because service was slow, and the restaurant was not busy, but had lots of employees.",

The food and service were the best we've had in Las Vegas in a long time (in a casual setting).  The staff was genuinely welcoming and engaged, and the general manager, Fred, even came over to our table when we had a question with the wine.  The pizza and salads were so good that we ate at the restaurant a second time before we left town.  We really appreciated having a good meal late -- many of the nice restaurants don't serve after 11 pm on the weekends, and we didn't even pop in until about that time.  This restaurant is on our short list for next time we visit Vegas in October.  Great job, guys!",

Our pizza was very bland and I had to put on bunch of Parmesan cheese and hot pepper to give it some flavor.  They had a single server for an entire section and was it slow!  They need to hire another person or buy that girl some roller skates.  Worse, my beer was not cold (but I still drank it all :P)...  I used a gift card to pay and they said my balance was zero, which was incorrect as I know I had over one hundred dollars on it.  I put the tip on the gift card and made a note to check my balance.  They charged me $3 more on the tip!!!  Not enough to go back and complain but still, the service was sub-par and food not very good, so I WILL be disputing it with VISA.",

Nice spot with big airy dining area and open kitchen. Great staff and still one of the best pizza's I have anywhere in the country. Found out from the server, they treat the water to add minerals to mimic the water used for the dough in NYC. If you have never had coal fire pizza, you really need too. The ovens are even hotter than wood fire and that results in an even better dough. They make pizza the correct way, without too much cheese and a balanced sauce (not too sweet). If you need your real NYC pizza fix, you can't do better in Las Vegas. Definitely worth going out of the way for if you are craving great pizza.",

Great cannolis.   The location was super quiet when we were there (early dinnertime). At the back of the ultra-upscale Shops at the Palazzo, I'm guessing that this pizza joint isn't often busy.

The antipasto platter was very good too. As for the pizza...while it's not real New York it was as close as I've had anywhere outside of NY. The sausage was fantastic and the bubbly, charred crust was one of the highlights. Love that stuff. They also made an Italian Margarita that was delicious and not too sweet. We got there a bit before 5 and had to wait for our pizza because they don't start the oven until 5. But that was a great move because we got a nice table in the patio area. At 5 when the ovens fired up the crowd rolled in quickly. The great salad, antipasto and Margaritas made the wait for the ovens a breeze.",

The restaurant itself lives up the standard of fancy Vegas. We were seated on the outside front of the restaurant. We got The Don, which had italian sausage on it. We also got a veggie pizza (forgot the name). What really stood out was the thin crust and amazing cheese. I could just taste the quality of the cheese. Love it when you bite into it and it stretches out until it breaks...mmmmm. The crust was thin but not soggy created the perfect base for our pizza.  We had leftovers and ate it on the car ride back to LA....it was still delicious!!!!",

    "text": "Excellent NY style pizza someplace in the Venetian mall. The house salad is huge and filled with fresh vegetables and a tasty Italian dressing. The portions here are huge and two hungry people can easily split the small salad.  The pizza itself is the star, they use a coal fired oven which gives in a little bit of char and more crunch than many pizzas. The pizza has a sauce with a little bit of spice and doesn't need too much cheese. I had mushroom and black olives, the pizza was fresh, hot, and one of the best I've had. The 15 inch is plenty of food for two people. We had a salad and pizza and had about four slices left.   Service was very friendly and they did a good job giving this place the look and feel of a real NY pizzeria in the middle of a mall on the strip. This place is a must try for excellent pizza that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "I was first drawn to the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn a few years ago and since then, I've been returning to a number of their franchises both in Nevada and Florida. Known for their coal-fired brick ovens, the pizzas are great, but nothing like the first time I stepped into their Brooklyn storefront. Maybe it was the New York water or being cooked in that original over 100-year-old brick oven, but it was just better.   Grimaldi's has since then franchised out and I'm not sure if they even own that location in Brooklyn anymore. The pizza recipe and flavor is probably diluted a bit, but I love that familiar chewy crust. The ingredients are fresh and it definitely compares to any $15 fancy pizza that you may find in a hipster metropolitan restaurant. Although I love the classic margherita, the white sauce with garlic is also a nice option.",

They offer a gluten free crust, with the disclaimer about possible cross contamination.  How could they not: it's a pizzeria and the flour is everywhere.  I ordered the white pizza on the gf crust, with tomatoes and mushrooms.  It's was excellent.  After it cold, it wasn't as great, but it's a lot better than some gf pizzas I've had. GF crusts are only available 12 inch.  Which was fine.  Haha I ate all but one slice by myself.   My husband got a regular crust which was crispy and chewy at the same time-lots if bubbles and char.  He loved it.    For drinks I got the summer sangria.  Super yummy.    Service : other parties experienced a delay in getting served or even welcomed.  The problem could have been their particular server, or perhaps the manager, who was busily not helping out at all.  Not sure the story there but I would start there to address any problems.  Our waitress was attentive and pleasant.  All you could ask for.   Others didn't fare as luckily.",

We were seated promptly on a Friday night and our server was friendly.  This might be one of the few places where I think the salad was much better than the pizza. To start, my group tried both the Spinach Salad and Caesar Salad and liked both equally. The portions for the salads were generous for the price. There was a rouge hair we found in the Spinach Salad that the waitress replaced quickly, however.  For pizza, we opted for the 16\" Traditional White Sauce which ultimately was not memorable. Although the pizza was hot, it did not taste fresh. We requested tomatoes and sausage as toppings which were fine. The 16\" overall fed my party of three but none of us really wanted to head back afterward. If you do end up coming, maybe load up on a bunch of toppings (which incur an extra charge per topping).",

    "text": "I went to the original Grimaldi's once upon a time, waiting under the Brooklyn Bridge for half an hour in the freezing cold. It was nice to waltz into this Vegas location like it was any old pizza joint. Maybe this speaks to my lack of character, but I think pizza tastes just as good without the suffering.  We stopped in for a quick dinner last month on our way out of town. The place was pretty quiet at 6:00 on a Sunday, and we were able to get seated immediately. It was a casual spot with an easy vibe, with a few overt nods to its New York roots--subway signs and some black and white photos of the city. Service was mostly fine, though we did wait an unreasonably long time for our wine. We ordered a bottle of Candoni pinot noir right away, only to receive with our food twenty minutes later.  We shared a salad and a large pizza for dinner, and this was an appropriate amount of food for four people, especially at the tail end of a gluttonous weekend. The Caesar salad was good, with romaine lettuce, shaved Italian cheese, coal oven-baked croutons, and Caesar dressing. More importantly, the pizza hit the spot.  Grimaldi's base traditional pizza involves a secret recipe tomato sauce, hand-sliced mozzarella, basil, and a signature blend of cheese and spices. This all comes on a thin crust, nicely charred and bubbled up with heat from the oven. We got our pie topped half Margherita and half Brooklyn Bridge. The Margherita added extra sauce and fresh basil to the traditional pizza, the Brooklyn Bridge oven-roasted red peppers, creamy ricotta, and Italian sausage. I had two slices of the Brooklyn Bridge, and it was pretty delicious.  If you want New York-style pizza in Vegas, Grimaldi's is a solid bet. The food is tasty and you can leave the character-building conditions to the New Yorkers.",

    "text": "Grimaldi's has always been on my list when I'm in New York, but the line is always around the block. I was excited that this location exists in Vegas. We dined in on what they call the \"patio\" which is really seating outside the bar that looks into the hotel. You can people watch while they shop. We originally ordered the large house salad to split but were talked into just ordering the small salad by our server. We were disappointed by the small salad as we could have both eaten that size ourselves. Minus one star for this recommendation.   We ordered the 16 inch don pizza. The pizza was pretty good; it had thin crust and the toppings and cheese were good. The pizza was a little too saucy for my liking and wish the crust was cooked slightly more.   For drinks, we ordered the stout and a red wine. It wasn't until after I was done with my wine that our server brought the more extensive wine menu. Where was this at the beginning of our meal when I asked for recommendations?! Too little, too late.  Food: 4/5 Service: 2/5",

Towards the end of the evening, we had a taste for pizza and after seeing the rave reviews on Yelp, we decided to order takeout just to sample. Thank goodness we did! It's by far one of the best pizzas I've ever had hands down!   We got the Margherita pizza and jazzed it up with pepperonis, sausages, mushrooms and fresh basil to brightened it up with the splendid \"house-blended tomato cream sauce\" on a Perfect crispy crust! The pizza was out of this world Ah-mazing!   We had every intention of eating it at the hotel but, after a quick taste test it did not make it to its original destination. We devoured in along the way and finished it in the car. It was that Good!   The attached photo does not do it justice!   I highly recommend it for your pizza fix!",

    "text": "There are loads of restaurants to pick from when visiting Las Vegas. I had read this place was a popular choice and since my buddies and I were craving pizza, we decided to come here.  Grimaldi's is located in the Palazzo Hotel on the strip. We took an Uber ride from Mandalay Bay Hotel around 10pm on a weekend summer evening and had no issues getting a table.  Actually, the restaurant was pretty quiet. The whole vibe at Grimaldi's certainly exudes Italian. I'd say it bordered on being slightly upscale for casual pizza dining.  For myself and my two friends, we decided to try the 18-inch (their largest sized pizza offered), THE DON, under the Chef's Pizza selections for $28. We were unsure about whether to get an appetizer or a 2nd pizza as we didn't know how much food would be suffice.  For The Don, the recipe consisted of a traditional pizza topped with Italian sausage, meatballs and pepperoni.   Here's where things got awkward and sort of disappointing for me....when we asked our server for a slight adjustment to the ingredients for our toppings, he said \"no problem\".  When we got our pizza shortly after ordering, it was delicious, we all enjoyed it. When we received our check, our server made a $3 adjustment for changing our pizza into a \"half and half\" pizza!  Essentially, we weren't even adding a topping, we were actually subtracting a topping by making the pizza into a half and half.   When we questioned the waiter about the change, he said there was a fee for making the pizza into a \"half and half\". That was sort of a shock for us, without warning.  Ya know, when you're in Vegas, I guess it's taken for granted that since you're immersed in money and gambling, fees are no big deal. Though it wasn't about the money, it was the principal of the whole thing.   Lol....it actually seemed like we were living in a Larry David story for Curb Your Enthusiasm or Seinfeld. We had never heard of a \"half and half fee\"....and we didn't see it mentioned on the menu either.  Most confusing is that our waiter argued with us about the fee instead of just letting it go. We were sort of laughing about the whole thing...being such a peculiar situation.  Regardless of our new understanding for a \"half and half fee\", my friends and I sort of had enough from our time at Grimaldi's and decided to leave even though we considered ordering another pizza because the food was good. One thing to mention....if you've ever eaten coal fired pizzas, they're normally thin crusted and not too filling where you can usually eat more than normal for pizzas like these. We should have ordered a 2nd pizza.  Finally, what was so unusual about our experience here was that our server showed no remorse or care for the fact we felt a little slighted. We were on vacation and we figured he'd give us the benefit of the doubt.  Although...he seemed pretty unapologetic for the whole instance. You'd think with prices at Grimaldi's being above average for pizzas, he'd work hard for his customers.  Oh well...although we had a lingering instance from our experience....the pizza was still fresh out of the oven crispy and tasty. I can't knock them for that.",

    "text": "Came here around 8:40pm on a Sunday night and we're able to get seated promptly. Ordered a Mediterranean salad, a white pizza with garlic + mushrooms and sausage. It came out first, and it was fantastic. The garlic flavor really shines and is definitely the best part of the pizza. I'm not sure if it was because of the mushrooms, but the center of the pizza was quite soggy.   Next came the Margherita and my personal favorite, especially if you're eating a later dinner like we were, it's very simple and you simply get to enjoy all the ingredients as they are. The bottom of the pizza was crispy throughout and brought me back to my first thin crust slice at some random spot in Brooklyn some time long ago. Sauce is excellent, basil was fresh, and the crust - amazing. Highly recommended to enjoy thin crust pizza au naturel without all the extra toppings getting in the way!  Sizes come in 12\"/16\"/18\". 12 and 16 both come with 6 slices, but the 12\" is like the size of your plate. Two 16\" pizzas were enough to feed are party of 6 with the salad (so two slices each). Depending on the cuts you might get some uneven slices, so share accordingly.  Thanks Grimaldi's!",

It was a Sunday late afternoon, it wasn't that busy.  We were seated right away. Both of us had different tastes so we went half and half on our medium pizza. The pizza came out hot, the vegetable toppings were fresh. I'm not a thin crust guy, but with their oven, it was crisp and blended in nicely with the toppings. Our waiter was attentive, and the decor is old school. The price is a bit high, but a good experience overall.",

    "text": "Nestaha, a recent transplant from Arizona, was our server, and she was very nice, as well as attentive (refilled our drinks, checked in on us several times, boxed up our leftover pizza). She also had some suggestions though we've been to this popular pizza restaurant many times- it's just that this was our first time to this particular location. We actually got re-routed here, as there was a huge traffic jam on Spring Mountain- we were set to visit the Fashion Show location (the Strip and freeway ramps were shut down due to the VP's visit at the casino for a rally, which we did not know was taking place).    This location is pretty big (we've now been to three locations around the city). There is outside seating as well (well, it is outside of the restaurant, but still part of the shopping center, not really outside outside). The inside seating starts with the bar, which is at the front side, and then there is a long hallway of tables leading to the main dining area, which faces the front of the Palazzo shops building, and also the open kitchen (you can see the cooks prepare the pizza and place them into the oven- they kept making pies!). Our table faced the hallway with the side fronting the escalator (so we sort of had the fishbowl effect, seeing all the people go down the escalator---well, it was a two way street, good people-watching, hahaha). It's nice inside this one, the layout, I like it.  There were quite a few other diners, but because it is pretty spacious, it didn't seem to run out of room or get crowded (or get loud, with conversation, for that matter). We also recommended this place to my longtime friend who was visiting LV with her daughter. They visited the following night. They ordered the Dom without the meatballs.    Our son got to enjoy playing with the pizza dough presented on a pizza pan. We enjoyed the complimentary sliced bread, with the oil and balsamic vinegar, topped with black pepper. We got our favorite pizza, meatball pizza, thin crust, and like always, it was perfect. There was a good amount of cut meatballs, as you can see from my pics. Our son loves lots of extra cheese on it. I add some to my slices but I also add the crushed red pepper, too. For dessert, we got the Oreo Cheesecake (we split it three ways)- it is my favorite cheesecake because it is light and airy. I don't like the thick, dense sort of cheesecake.   It's our son's favorite pizza, so when we talk about pizza, he thinks we are always talking about Grimaldi's. He responds with: \"Meatball Pizza- yay!\" It's taken a while, but I was a huge fan of Metro Pizza's Gotham; after our last visit there (the pizza was a little soggy), I can honestly say that Grimaldi's is officially now my favorite pizza. (Years ago, I saw it on \"Food Wars\", too.)",

Sauce does not taste as good as NY, maybe its the water.   update: this review is for service only.  We walked in at 9 pm with a drink. We were staying at Palazzo.  Walking with a drink to Grimaldis is a mistake and the hostess made sure to tell us that. She didnt acknowledge us as we entered but made sure to take our drink and put in \"on the side\", she also said we are not Palazzo and a third party so we dont enforce Palazzo's rules here. Ok for a customer let me tell you this, your restaurant is \"INSIDE\" palazzo, so put a sign outside saying you are not Palazzo. But we overlooked that and then the bartender came to take our order, he was a total and a complete ahole to us. Very rude and does not belong in the servie industry. We walked out.

We were very grateful they have gluten free pizza, though there is a note underneath on the menu that warns about cross contamination etc. but part of it said that not all toppings are gluten free. But the menu does not label which are or aren't. And when asking the waiter he replied with \"I don't know\" and that it isn't certified gluten free etc. it took a while for him to finally say he will ask his manager. There were only a couple toppings that were not gluten free: the spicy chicken sausage and the meatballs.  Cons: - we waited a really long time to be seated. There was no one in front of us and there were tables available but since the main seating person wasn't there we couldn't be seated even thought 2 other staff members asked us how many. - prices are steep, even for Vegas. 2 toppings were $2 and $3 each, and the toppings were sparse. SPARSE. I ended up scraping off toppings off of other slices just so I could at least have a couple slices with a decent amount of toppings on it. - the gluten free crust was just okay. It was crispy but flavor-wise was just okay - the gluten free guest felt really awkward asking which toppings were gluten free only to get the response \"I don't know\" from the waiter. What did they expect them to do? Just not get toppings?   Pros: - regular pizza was good  - looks like they are an equal opportunity employer",

    "text": "So our friend brought a group of us to Grimaldi's. He said every time he's in Vegas he makes it a point to dine here. I was very pleasantly surprised with my first bite of the pizza. There were seven of us and we shared 3 large pizzas. (Pepperoni & Italian sausage, pepperoni & cheese, and pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms & jalapenos) Two of the guys were from the east coast and they even said it was the best pie they ever tasted. I enjoyed the pizza with a Caesar salad and the red house wine. I was in food heaven for the time we were there. I even ordered a pizza to go and ate some the next day. It was wonderful even cold! We will definitely make it a point to dine in every time we visit Vegas. Bon Appetite to the 10th degree!",

Grimaldi's crust is perfect, the tomato sauce has just the right flavor, and the toppings are top notch. You can smell this place the moment you enter the Palazzo building or turn the corner from the shops, and I'm very happy to say it's as good as it smells, maybe even better. Never have to wait to be seated, with fast and friendly service. We always have to hit Grimaldi's when in Vegas, and it's ruined us for any other pizza. Go, you'll love it.",

We shared a Ceaser salad, yummy.  Just like the way I like it crisp lettuce, cold out of the fridge, baked croutons with fresh shaved Parmesan cheese.  We just wanted to get a small bite, got the small (their version of medium) traditional pizza.  The sauce and cheese were good, but it's the thin crust dough that's sooooo good!  Suggestion;  Don't use the Parmesan cheese that's on the table but ask for the fresh shaved Parmesan.  The place is nicely decorated and has a cool vibe.  The reason I gave it 4 stars; our waitress forgot our waters, forgot to bring croutons that we asked on the side, and we had to ask twice for our check.   C'mon it's a service job if you can't get the order right at least bring the check on time...  Just keepin' it real The Real Foodie",

The sauce is just the right blend of tasty but not too overpowering. The crust is crunchy and done just right - brown but not burnt. The toppings all complement each other (I tried pepperoni, Italian sausage and black olives tonight). The service is very good. Prices are reasonable for Vegas.

    "text": "As this is one of my favorite meals in New York every time I visit, when I saw this on this side of the country (and just discovered another one opening in El Segundo later this year!!), I HAD to go. The waitress said that everything is the exact same as the one in Brooklyn, even down to the water they use for the dough.  So you customize your own pizza and can make it a personal size or share with others. For 2 ppl, the large (18\" for $16 + $2-4 per topping) is a pretty good size that gives you 6-8 slices. All I can say is GET THE RICOTTA CHEESE. Seriously.  The waitress also highly recommended the new amaretto cheesecake as well... good luck trying to save stomach room for that!  Thus my review of the original Brooklyn location holds the same for this location (except for the 45 min wait since this location is much bigger): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/grimaldis-brooklyn#hrid:Q_ExojPX-KbgJvNS1Bnujw\">yelp.com/biz/grimaldis-b...</a>  1 Front St Brooklyn, NY 11201 (718) 858-4300  11/28/2009  \"The best New York pizza I've ever had! Being a California girl, I've still managed to make my way to Grimaldi's twice this year and even waited in the 45 minute long line to get into the door. The wait was definitely worth the fresh, doughy, thin crusted pizza with an array of toppings to delight your taste buds. I think the first time I went, we ordered mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta on our pizza. The second time we ordered basil, sun dried tomatoes, and sausage. Both times the pizza wasn't too oily or too cheesy, and the chewy sun dried tomatoes gave the texture an extra kick. And despite my friends and I eating the entire large pizza, we still walked out without the bloated, heavy feeling. Excellent.\"",

    "text": "We went, on the last night of our Las Vegas sojourn, to Grimaldi's as we both fancied pizza and salad.  Grimaldi's seemed to be a decent place so we decided to check it out. We were sorely disappointed. so many things were not quite right at Grimaldi's. Number one for me was that they put tomato sauce on their Marguerita pizza. I would have had that pizza but for that. Anyone who knows pizza knows that that is a no-no on a Marguerita. Second, coal-fired ovens? It might be cheaper to run coal-fired ovens but a wood-fired oven imparts a far better flavour into the pizza. Onto the food itself. I ordered a white 12\" pizza with anchovies and black olives, my wife, one of their 12\" garden pizzas. To top them off we ordered a bowl of salad to share. The salad came out first and it was nice and fresh, had a nice vinaigrette dressing and a few additions. Could have done with a bit more of the additions, they were a bit sparse. The pizzas arrived and they were crispy on the edges and a bit doughy in the middle. Probably could have done with another 30 seconds or so in the oven. My pizza was okay but nothing to write home about, I could find probably get as good a pizza in my local Dominos (if not better on a good night!). My wife's pizza was not good at all. She had to sprinkle both parmesan (which she said was an inferior type of) and salt on the pizza to get any flavour out of it and said that the toppings were extremely bland and lacked any flavour at all. I had a cocktail which was nice but with an overall bill of just over 60 bucks for two pizzas, a salad and a drink we were most underwhelmed by the experience. We will not be visiting Grimaldis again and were most unimpressed with their items. Thank you.",

Not crazy about how drink runners interrupted us to auction drinks as they came out, and that staff did not yield to guests to let them pass. The pizza was great- crisp tasty crust, not too thin or cracker like, zesty sauce and great quality toppings we had the Don with amazing Italian sausage, pepperoni and meatballs, and the one with sausage, peppers and ricotta- both great! Cannoli made to order and perfectly crispy. Enjoy",

    "text": "Coal brick oven pizza!!  Supposedly that's one of the best ways to bake pizza.  And Grimaldi's punch line is \"the pizza that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous\".  Anyways, this place was recommended by one of the managers working at the Venetian.  It HAD to be good.  So they have personal, medium, and large; we opted for the large at ($18).  You select your toppings starting at ($2) each; we chose the fresh garlic and Italian sausage.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#STZXp7K9wnVPNTo4mWOYFw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/grim...</a> This is probably one of the few times I've had NY style crust, and WHOA it tastes so delicious, especially when it's hot and the handmade (!) mozzarella is so melty, creamy, and cheesy.  There were nice, soft tomato chunks in the pizza sauce.    I'd recommend trying their salads, we ordered the large Caesar salad ($9) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#x8UalMguK50OYQZmSPWA4A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/grim...</a> to munch on while the pizza was baking.  I don't know how they make salads so good, because the lettuce was cut into SMALL bite-sized pieces, dewy but not too wet, and the caesar dressing was perfectly spicy and peppery.  Topped with fresh parmesan cheese... YEAH A VERY GOOD SALAD.    The decor is beautiful in here.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#nKsnllmo62-w6zwkqh4Jow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/grim...</a> Bottomless wine bottles with tiny lights in them are configured in a chandelier arrangement on the ceiling.  Their \"patio\" area opens into the mall area, and sort of in a corner location so I'd recommend sitting in the regular dining area (which is more beautiful).  But the patio does open right into the bar area.  Quick, attentive service.  No problem at all.",

It was quiet and the staff was incredibly attentive. We took a seat out front which was nice and had a view of the bar.  Their pizzas are absolutely amazing. They make sure to make them as close to the original in Brooklyn as possible. They built the same type of oven and even ship in NYC water for authenticity. Duly noticed! I haven't been to the Brooklyn version, but this was fantastic and the best I may have ever had outside of NY.   Also, sign up for their email club, they'll give you a free pizza on your birthday!

But the cheese on these pizzas was super good and much better than the regular shredded cheese that is usually on pizza!!! Also I love thin crust!!   Decor was cool because there were lights inside of beer bottles! I found that pretty unique ..   Minus a star because the pizza was expensive and the service was extremely slow..

We made two pizzas for 4 people and it was definitely more than enough, especially after getting salads and the tomato w/ mozarella.   The pizzas were very good and made fresh. If you're looking for a NY style pizza with thin crispy crust, sauce on the top, then the is the place you need to go. The pizzas are a decent price but every time you want to add something you'll see your money fly onto the top of the pizza. Everything you want to add costs something which is the downside. Pesto $2, shrooms $2, chicken $4, etc etc. I think those are the prices but you get the point. It cost a good amount to make the perfect pizza you want. Don't be afraid to make a half half pizza either.   The pizzas overall were really good. Take your time in this place because they make everything to order but it's worth the wait. Sit down, relax and enjoy your hot pizza. Come to this place and take a break from Vegas and lose yourself in the NY themed place.",

Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks were all refilled multiple times , she came by often to ask how we were doing and how the food was. My only question is if you're going to give bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil to all tables why not have a little bowl dish for it? We had to either just put it on a flat plate or straight on the bread. Didn't work out too well. Maybe that's just me who thinks that is annoying but other than that I enjoyed the pizza and out service.",

My mother, sister and I stumbled upon it when we were shopping. The 3 of us split a small ceasar salad and a pepperoni pie! It was fantastic. So when I received an email for a free pizza on my birthday from Grimaldi's I was quick to jump on the chance to give them another try.  This time we visited their store in Henderson. It's located in a quiet shopping center just off the 215. We opted to sit outside at their bar. Although it was July and pretty warm, we stayed cool under their misting system.   They had a nice selection of beer, with the classics and a few micro brews. I went with a Sam Adam's Summer Ale, one of my favorites. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and while we were waiting we were entertained by the bartender. She was hysterical and provided us with exceptional service.  Just like my first trip to Grimaldi's at the Venetian/Palazzo, their pizza was exceptional! They are consistently good pizza that takes me back to the east coast.   If you want to score a free pizza, like I did this trip, be sure to sign up for their mailing list. As I mentioned in my Las Vegas Birthday Freebies post, they will email you a coupon for a free pizza for your Birthday!",

The tomato sauce used for the pizza tastes homemade and the cheese used is real mozzarella instead of that shredded stuff most restaurants gets from the local restaurant depot.  I love a crisp crust with a slight chewiness.    The sausage and mushroom is best, the chicken pesto is good but I've had better.",

But it is a good thin crust pizza.  This one is much fancier than the original. They have a host that seats you, a very nice dark wooden bar, and large wine glasses at every table in case you order a bottle. Nice brick walls with framed NYC pictures hanging through out.   Our waiter was great. Very polite and would give us updates on our pizza. Too bad I forgot his name but his a tall white man that is bald, if I remember his name I revise this review because he deserves to be mentioned.  A large can fill three to four people and the have many topping, including a white pizza and other Italian dishes.  You can't go wrong here if you like a good thin pizza pie!!

We loved the neat atmosphere of this place, from the checkered tablecloths to the unique bottle lighting and brick walls-definitely a fun but yet relaxing kind of vibe. The pizza tasted great-flavorful and with just the right amount of toppings. Since we dined here on my birthday, we used the birthday coupon they emailed me (after joining their club), which made for a nice, small bill to make our experience that much better. Thank you, Grimaldi's, for making my birthday meal a great, tasty one, and for the awesome coupon! We will definitely be back!",

He had been here two times before on this trip and recommended it. The pizza was fine (we split a small, top-your-own with pepperoni and sausage), although I wasn't sure about the taste of the sausage topping (but don't get me wrong, I still ate my half). Prior to the pizza, we also split a tomato mozzarella salad. This was good (hard to get that salad too wrong) and we both left the meal feeling full. They don't have Coke products, so while I would have liked a nice Diet Coke with my meal, I stuck with water. It's set away from the casino noise, which was nice, and certainly gives you ample portions.",

I love this location because you can look out onto the Encore and Wynn and, at nighttime, it's a really beautiful sight.  I just love those tall buildings with their sparkly signs!  The wine bottle chandeliers are really cool, too.  The restaurant is very clean and decor is simple and inspiring for a NY'er with touches of NY all around (subway signs, photos of NY landmarks - Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, Coney Island, etc).    This is such a taste of home but with a more \"upscale\" feel than some of the other locations.    Deliciousness and pure fulfillment, as always.",

One of the employees told us that a large is good for only 3-4 people, but my friend insisted we stick with it. Im glad we did because the large was more than enough for us.  We got the Brooklyn Bridge pizza which took about 20 minutes. We brought it back to our hotel and it still tasted AMAZING.

If you're inside Palazzo, look for the waterfall on the 1st floor and go up the escalator to the right. It's on the 2nd floor opposite direction of the waterfall.  Look for the exit/entrance to the Palazzo and it's right there!  What to get:  for a family of 4 with two toddlers, start with a large Cesar salad and get a large size pizza with meatballs and extra sauce. The pizzas have a really thin crust so its not as filling so it may not be enough for others. So yummy!

I expect a renowned and highly regarded place such as Grimaldi's to be superb in all respects, especially being located in a place such as The Palazzo.  Our large thin New York style meatball, mushroom and fresh garlic pizza took around 40-45 mins to come out after we had to ask the waitress when we could expect it.  By the time it got to us it wasn't hot.  Barely lukewarm.  When I started on my second slice it was all cold (4-5 mins later).  A Chicago style deep dish pizza doesn't even take this long to make.    We asked for a side of marinara and it's been almost 10 mins and still nothing.  So we gave up and just asked for the check.  As a side note they were NOT busy.  Barely a handful of costumers.  I would not recommend coming here.  There's lot of better restaurants in this hotel and this city that serve HOT and good food without making you wait.

He brought our paid bottle of water, but we also asked for regular water also, as we had been outside in 95-100 degree weather for a couple of hours, and were super thirsty! Then he completely forgot about us, till we asked for the bill. Another food runner brought us our water and refilled our glasses, brought us our food, asked if we were ok. I wished I could have given him my tip instead of the actual server! Pizza was fine. But I'd dare to say it wasn't even as good as JJ Dolan's back at home, in Honolulu!!

The prices aren't boosted because of the Vegas location, so the prices of pizza you see here are the same as on the East Coast!  A large pizza pie will feed 3 hungry men, depending on how much of the sangria you've ingested by the time the pizza comes around, but some toppings that create a pizza thats on point, in my opinion, are artichoke hearts, italian sausage, and pepperoni and olives.

    "text": "Of course my trip would not be complete without stopping by this place. I love the pizza here and I know we have one in Dallas but I just come to this one for some reason.   I know there are a couple of other good spots but I love the service here. I always sit at the bar whether I'm alone or with a friend.   Shawmbi was the bartender this night and he was awesome. I made a new friend at the bar too. I gave her a couple of slices of my pizza and she said it was \"yummy\". We then went on to play some craps after we finished our meal. ;) This is like the third time I made a friend at the bar and we went on to play some craps.   So if you love pizza you should def give this place a try. It's thin and always comes out in good time and hot. The kitchen is open late and you can also get your pizza to go if you don't want to dine in.   The salads are huge here just so u know. I could not finish mine. They have lots of toppings for pizzas. I haven't tried anything else on the menu though. It's all about the pizza for me.   Order a small pizza if you're alone. Sometimes it can even be enough for two depending on your appetite.   Prices are very reasonable too. Of course I'm going back next time.",

    "text": "Over the course of my Vegas trips with the No1DP I've seen people carrying pizza boxes from Grimaldi's. The No1DP, being a huge fan of NY-style pizza, never fails to get a slice every time he's in the area. It not only serves up a good slice but its location just outside the entrance to the Venetian|Palazzo complex is a short walk from the hotel the No1DP is staying (usually the Palazzo or Encore). I finally got a chance to eat here as an alternative to another nearby restaurant as I though this place would serve a no-frills yet delicious meal shortly before my flight.  CONCEPT: Grimaldi's Pizza is known for its signature coal-burning oven, specifically anthracite coal. It burns more cleanly than gas or wood and the oven reaches to 1200F. Supposedly the water system is specifically designed to emulate NY-style water that is used in making authentic NY-style pizza dough (thin and crispy).  VENUE: Grimaldi's is close to the entrance of the Venetian|Palazzo when coming from the bridge that connects the hotel complex with the Wynn/Encore. There was plenty of indoor seating on a Sunday night. They are not truly affiliated with the Palazzo so they cannot use resort credit/comps to pay for the bill.   SERVICE: Our service for the most part was attentive except at the end where she didn't catch that we wanted tiramisu to go.  We opted for the house salad with mozzarella addition (romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, vinaigrette dressing, $6/small).  The bowl was generous with its non-lettuce toppings and certain veggies such as cherry tomatoes, red onion and olives tasted fresh. I think I got full quite quickly due to the veggies.  The No1DP is a traditionalist - he wants his pizza with tomato sauce (I gently suggested to try pesto or white pie with garlic to no avail) so we got the small pizza (16 inches - 6 slices, serves 2-3 people, $14). For toppings we got pepperoni ($3), sausage ($3), mushrooms ($2), green bell peppers ($2) and onions ($2). The crust was thin and crispy and the cheese oozed out of the slice. Pepperonis were small and crunchy, mushrooms were juicy and there was a good amount of onions. The big perk about these pies is that they are easily customizable to diner's preferences though there are certain pre-made pies available.  One big perk was that the No1DP and I technically paid with resort winnings. Were able to pay for this meal with our modest $58 we won from betting the outside track on roulette then converted it to cash. Thanks Palazzo.  This is our preferred pizza place on the Venetian|Palazzo side of the Strip (Secret Pizza at the Cosmo is our preferred pizza place on the other side as I see more than a handful of people carrying Secret Pizza boxes)",

My husband and I shared a regular pizza with artichokes, garlic, basil, and sundried tomatoes. It was delicious and I absolutely loved the crust on the pizza!! It had that great oven-toasted taste and the perfect chewiness! We also got the Spinach Salad which came with bacon, red onions, cherry tomatoes, gorgonzola, and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was pretty good, tasted fresh and went well with our pizza. I haven't tried the original Grimaldi's in New York but I'm a fan based on my experience here. I would definitely try out their other locations if I'm craving pizza. They also have a white sauce base and pesto base for their pizzas which sounds unique! Definitely wanna try that someday!  Service was okay. we were being served by a girl who was in training. I felt pretty bad for her because she was obviously nervous but I give her props for trying hard and for smiling!",

The outter crust was burnt and somehow, the crust under the pizza was slight burnt but was still mushy enough you couldn't pick up your slice to eat it, and had to cut it me eat it with a fork instead. The wait staff was fun and kind but pretty disorganized.

Random note, they had some odd bright LED lights facing our table so it's always nice to get blinded while eating.",

    "text": "Wow! That is probably the best pizza i have ever had ( and i am not a big pizza fan all) so i was a bit skeptical going in at first, but then i read some great reviews here on yelp and decided to give it a try. I am certainly glad i did! My husband and i ordered a small house salad. It was just ok, simple, but very fresh. Small white pizza (it was so large that i thought we should have just gotten a personal size pizza to split) with Italian sausage, mushrooms and fresh tomatoes. They make it right in front of you. The pizza came out with very thin crust, the fresh mozzarella cheese they use was amazing and probably what made the whole pizza taste as good as it did. We also ordered some white house wine ($4/glass, $9/ half carafe, which is actually pretty big) I would say this is the cheapest alcohol you can find in Vegas. Service was very good and i would definitely recommend it to anyone. The whole dinner cost us $37. Super cheap for Vegas and super good!",

I was skeptical at first, thinking it couldn't be as good, but it was very True to the original.  I would give it about 85% the same.  The waiter told us that they did have the coal oven and that the water was calibrated, by a chemist, to be exactly like the Brooklyn water haha.  It was awesome!",

We got a regular one with mushrooms, sweet red peppers, and sausage. It was pretty good! I think this was the first time I had thin-crust NY-style - such a difference from Chicago-style deep dish. I like thin-crust because you don't feel so heavy afterwards, but you also don't really get full.  We also ordered the white pizza, which is just cheese and garlic. I thought this was such a waste of a pizza...but it was actually REALLY good. For all of  you garlic-lovers, definitely try it! I wouldn't suggest any toppings since it takes away from the cheese and garlic flavor.   Our server was great.  This place is pretty big so I don't think you should have problems getting seated.  One word of advice for you NY-style pizza noobs, don't ask for ranch!",

We got the greek salad and I think that was the highlight of my meal. I loved it!  Oh, do NOT NOT NOT get the dessert 10 dollar trio thing!!! It is totally not worth it.  We thought they were gonna give us a full size dessert but it was a quarter size of a real slice. Not worth it. If you are going to get dessert just share ONE cheesecake.

All the elements just don't harmonize.   The crust is overcooked. It's too hard, too crispy with no chewiness. I suggest that the Grimaldi clan go to Settebello in Green Valley and tast real Neapolitan pizza.  Crust should be chewy, not hard dammit! Take a trip to Napoli, the birthplace of pizza, if you don't believe me.  The toppings are not in synch with any of the other toppings. It's as if they were chosen on their own with no awareness of how they would ultimately work together.  And please!  This coal-fired nonsense, and New York water nonsense doesn''t mean anything, except as a marketing ploy to get gullible tourists to think they're eating something special.   If you want great pizza, go down the street to Sicili's Pizza on Twain. It's in a ghetto area, so I don't advise eating in, but as take-out or delivery, it's amazingly good. And at half the price!!!  But if you're a lazy tourist who doesn't want to leave the casino, then you're stuck with this mediocre pizza.  If this represents New York pizza, given the fame of Grimaldi's in New York, I've never been happier not to live in that overcrowded, smelly, cesspool.",

Serious, Grimaldi's got chops and since they are now in the Palazzo it's a lot easier to get a pie fix. I opted for the calzone this time and of course I wasn't disappointed the only gripe (and it's minor) is that the cost of the extras on a calzone IMHO is a tad over-priced. But the bread crust is amazing, the sauce is molte bella, and Grimaldi's would certainly make a top 5 on anyone's pizzeria list.",

    "text": "Hearing that this is a New York transplant in Vegas, my friend had urged that I try out Grimaldi's. Upon arriving in Vegas, this was the first place we hit up, less than an hour after they opened.   The hostess was quick to meet us and sat us outside in the main shopping area. I was hesitant at first because I didn't want the feel of being a zoo animal in an exhibit.   My friend ordered the classic Margherita pizza while I ordered the plain pesto pizza.  Knowing that they freshly make their pizzas, we waited patiently and were more than thrilled with the pizzas arrived. Shortly after we got our food, there was a holiday special performance with Santa and his dancing elves. This attracted a lot of attention throughout the mall, and hence, made me feel like the zoo animal I feared I'd become.  People would walk by, pointing at what we were eating. And to add brownie points? Close to the end of the holiday performance, 'fake snow' started falling from the ceiling of the shopping center, so we got the complimentary topping of soap suds on our pizza.  This was the reason this review is 3 stars, not 4 or 5. I felt my experience was really ruined as a result of the special performance and eating outside in the shopping area.  TIPS: 1. Don't eat here on the weekends in December. 2. Eat inside if you can, don't sit out in the shopping area. 3. Order the pesto - it's yummy.  Overall, the pizza was tasty. I love NY style pizza [I actually love all forms of pizza - i don't discriminate]. Grimaldi's knows how to impress with their pies - too bad the locale was not as impressive.  Staff is friendly - moderately attentive with the water. Just when I thought our server forgot us, he would show up. Not sure I'd come back since Vegas is full of great places to feast at, but definitely won't pass it up if Grimaldi's came up in culinary consideration conversation.",

Our waitress was extremely nice and tried to make conversation with us, but we weren't exactly in the mood to socialize since we were hungry and hungover. The only downside to this place is the amount of time it takes for the pizza to bake. I wish there was a little something for us to munch on while we waited. Nonetheless, we ended up taking our pizza to-go. Ordering over the phone is a must since I really hate waiting. And it opens til 2am. Perfect to call & pick up after a night at the club.",

It is definitely a great location for those staying in the Venetian or the Palazzo, but the place lacks character and is uninspired.   The pizza is just fine, especially if you're having a craving for it. However, it could and should be better than it is.",

    "text": "BEWARE the pizza at both Grimaldi's locations is TASTELESS !!!!!!!! Go to 800degrees for a 100 times better quality original neapolitean pizza and it's even cheaper.  This is my 3rd time at Grimaldi over the past year (i sadly went twice in the mall and once in the palazzo location). Even the soda each time was 99% ice and a sip of coke, it was like drinking flavored water. Please don't make my same mistake and tell them NO ICE if you want to have a taste of soda.  The tomato sauce it is flavorless, so you will see people adding salt like crazy to try to revive a cardboard tasting pizza. The cheese taste like rubber, flavorless as well. The dough is bad but not as bad as the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.   Do not believe brick oven and this gimmick terminology they use. Brick oven means the oven is made with brick, it doesn't mean wood burning oven. So basically brick oven doesn't mean anything.  One last issue is that for some reason the pizza has been each time barely warm and after you eat the second slice the rest of the pizza will be cold. Just be prepared.  Event the secret pizza at the Cosmopolitan and the pizza at the Aria is better! I personally don't like either of them but compared to Grimaldi they are great. My favorite, as I mentioned is 800degrees. Try it and you will thank me!!!!!",

Since we had 10 people in our party, I made a reservation ahead of time. We were seated right away when we arrived. One thing I like about this location is that it seems a lot more open than it's Green Valley counterpart. (I always feel like we're squished in there.)   Our waitress was great and very patient with our large group. She also made suggestions on wines after we told her what we were looking for. We ordered two large salads to share - Caesar and Greek - and they were your classic salads you might find elsewhere. However, the pizza is what we came for and both the Brooklyn Bridge and the Four Cheese were excellent. One of the pizzas had a 2-inch hole in it which, truthfully we might not have noticed had the manager not pointed it out and told us they were making us another small size of the same pizza for that reason. On top of all that, they were quick but not suspiciously quick!",

    "text": "5/5 price 5/5 quality and freshness of ingredients 5/5 amazing service   I have been to 3 Grimaldi locations and feel that this one is the best of the 3. Located inside the palazzo (NOT GRAND CANAL SHOPPES), it can be easily missed. A lot smaller than the other locations but service here is a lot better.  We had a party of 4 and were celebrating a birthday. My friend had a FREE large pizza for her birthday. We added meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta cheese. The meatballs are so soft and perfectly seasoned, not dry either. The pepperoni isn't like other pizza places that I've been to, it's a lot smaller and I don't really think it's that good. They don't skimp on the ricotta cheese either. Their pizzas aren't oily... Like at all. Each topping was about an additional $4. I feel that their toppings are limited but very fresh. They don't have any pineapple in case you're wondering. crust here is super thin but a large can definitely feed 3-4 people if you order sides!! I think a large pizza is $19.  We also ordered a large antipasto ($9) which came with bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, salami and olives. We were given slices of bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to enjoy with the antipasto. We also ordered the large house salad ($9) which came with romaine lettuce, mushrooms, olives, red onions and I'm not sure if I remember seeing tomatoes or not. It has a light and refreshing dressing.   The 4 of us were too full to eat dessert so I would say be careful when you order a large pizza because it IS very large. Also, you can do half pizza with toppings and the other half with different toppings but you still have to pay the entire price for the toppings if that makes sense.  Our server was so sweet, she explained the menu and their current specials and continually checked in on us. Our waters were always refilled. Food came out in a good amount of time.   Lovely decor, dim lighting, if you sit by the window you get a good view. Perfect for date nights.",

We were both in agreement that this pizza was did not live up to the hype. All the toppings were bland.  I don't know how you can rob bacon of its flavor but they managed to achieve this task here.  A large pepperoni, mushroom, bacon and half Italian sausage pizza was ordered and was just largely disappointing.  The artisan crust on a New York style pizza just doesn't work for me.    Now any red blooded American knows that ranch is mandatory with pizza.  Not hidden valley bottled ranch but a creamy delicious fresh made ranch more than complements a slice... It completes it.  So as we dined on America's birthday we requested ranch and were denied!  They do not have ranch because the executive chef does not approve of low brow ranch.  After this statement was made the server proceeded to bring out a shaker of, fresh out of the powdered bottle, of Parmesan cheese.  Ranch isn't acceptable but this is?    I will not be returning.  If you're looking for pizza In Vegas go to Secret Pizza.",

I will pay Grimaldi's a visit everytime I pay a visit to Sin City!   Julia S made our eating experience quite wonderful! She was very pleasant and so patient with us. Grimaldi's is so lucky to have someone like her working for them. I give her 5 stars!!  We ordered the Bruschetta w/ Chicken Pizza, We ordered a size small and it was perfect for my fiance and I. We are actually big eaters and suprisingly we were satisfied. It comes with oil and vinigar and we get to sprinkle how much we wanted on our pizza. It was so good.  My fiance wanted to take a picture of the chefs throw the pizza dough in the air and watch them spin it and everyone there were such great sports.   I recommend coming here. This is my must go to spot when I visit Vegas. And hopefully Julia will be working because I know I'll be asking for her.  Now I just hope they open one up in the San Francisco area. My fiance and I will be regular customers when that happens!",

We've been to the one under the Brooklyn bridge where we waited 2 hours to get a seat, in the hot July heat at the concrete jungle that is New York. Coming here, the place wasn't packed. It took awhile to walk around and try to find it in the Palazzo when the Palazzo isn't typically a place we would stop in for.   We got seated on the deck area facing the hallways. We watched a guy passed out and security trying to get him to move. He was clearly intoxicated and on a few other stuff. It was amusing to watch while we wait for our pizza.   We shared an extra large pizza with basil, their buffalo mozzarella and some pepperonis. It was delicious but I guess the fact that it wasn't in NY had something to do with it to deflate my excitement a bit. The waitress had a strong italian accent that really appealed to my father-in-law (who is Italian).   We've been dying to try this place in Vegas so craving fulfilled!",

The edge was quite burn, but that happens sometimes. The crust was really good. The cheese was a little strange how it cooked, maybe it was the type of cheese that was on it...not sure.   2. Service - We were seated in the patio area. The bartender was the server for the entire patio area. He seemed stretched a little thin managing both and he seemed to be outside his comfort zone waiting tables.   3. Alcohol/Bar - We did not order alcohol, but the two tables next to us did & this is based on overhearing them. Both tables ordered cocktails & both were unhappy with the quality. They both mentioned it to the server (not aware he was the one who made them) & he awkwardly apologized, but didn't offer to mend the problem in any way. One of the tables ordered a beer that was on tap to supplement the poor tasting cocktail & when the drink arrived, the glass was a little over half full. Based on my ease dropping ;) I would not come here for the alcohol.   4. Cleanliness - The bathroom wreaked of urine. I am pretty sure it is what was all over the floor...yuck.

We brought our friends from Canada here and told them it was my favorite and they loved it too. They also enjoyed watching the kitchen where they throw and spin the dough.

Coming from a 5-star hotel, you would expect better service. Am I right? Or am I right? Yes, I am right.   The waitress - I forgot what her name was because her \"service\" sucked balls - was not helpful at all and was very rude.  When we first arrived, she never greeted us and was trying to rush us into ordering. Dude! We're not at Pho Kim Long, were at The Palazzo!   Anyways, to start our dinner off, I wanted to order a glass of Sangria and asked our waitress what her recommendation was since I had a choice of a white or red Sangria. She answered me with, \"Well, that depends on what you like. If you like a sweet or sour.\" Ummmm, Chinese food sweet and sour?! Say what? Who? How? Where? When? That...was...helpful?! I guess! I blankly stared at her for a second and kept quiet. It was such an awkward moment, I HAD to just brush it off. You would think that she would at least make up some BS just to show that she was trying to help me but no, she did not. I ended up getting the white Sangria - just because the menu says that it has Moscato in it. Thanks to the menu, it was more helpful than our waitress! High 5!   As far as the pizza goes, who in their right minds would think that this place serves \"AMAZING\" pizza? Man, it was far from amazing I'll tell you that! Sometimes, I wonder if the waitress was the one who made the pizza because that pizza was just as bad as her service.   Reasons why I did not like the pizza:  Strike 1: The pizza came out warm...almost cold. Strike 2: The inner part of the pizza was soggy and VERY watery. Strike 3: The pizza sauce was acidic! It was worse that Ragu. Lmao!   Oh and to top off the horrible dinner experience, my 12-year-old nephew ordered a personal pizza and it came out last - after everyone had already eaten! WHY? Because apparently, when his pizza went into the brick oven, it flopped over. Lol!",

After that we got a cheese cake and cannoli.   Our server was Eric. All good. My only problem with the whole experience was two people behind me whinging at the manager for what seemed like ten minutes about how bad Eric was or something? Which seemed very weird to me as we were sitting beside them and had great service. Literally not a problem with the service here.",

The pizzas are good size and the pieces are large, only four stars because of how thin they were. Some may prefer this though!",

White Sauce, Red Sauce, Garlic, etc... Plenty of different toppings that are authentic and taste amazing. I personally enjoyed the Large Red with Pepperoni and Mushrooms.  Service: Pretty standard. Waitresses were quick and friendly, didn't really have a problem with them.  Atmosphere: Legitly decorated. Feels like a nice pizza place due to it's old-school photographs and table setting. Loved it.  Price: Between the 8 guys that went there, we paid around $10-12 each for a total of 3 Large pizzas. For Vegas that's pretty good especially when you're eating specialty food!  Overall Opinion: I thought this place was pretty up to par, but honestly nothing stood out enough for me to fall in love with this place. The food is great, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but nothing was there that screamed out \"I GOTTA COME BACK FOR THIS\".",

Classic 1200 degree coal burning ovens, formulated water with identical pH and mineral content of NYC water (not sure if this is a good thing).  All leads to what is undoubtedly one of the best NYC style pizza crust.  It's blistered,  well seasoned, just the right thinness with the perfect chew, with the perfect hint of smoky bitterness.    Dirt cheap for the Strip.  $9 for a personal 12\" red sauce pie $10 for a garlic white sauce or pesto.  Add $2 per topping including some great spiced meatballs, sweet Italian Sausage (American style), tender oven roasted peppers and milky mozzarella.  Mild intensity to any of the sauces to let the toppings show through.  Calzones are excellent.  Same great dough as the pies, same great filling in a hand held pouch.  True NYC pizzeria feel with the manager, hostess, and bartenders loudly shooting the breeze right at the door (when it's not too busy).    A well chosen  selection of wines focusing on Italy, most offered by the glass or half carafe (500ml or 2/3 of a whole bottle).  Reasonable prices.  Half off all wines on Tuesdays.  A welcome, affordable addition to the Palazzo.",

I will talk about this visit as it was the most recent. We order the bruschetta as a starter and it may of actual been the worst we ever had. I'm thinking that it was pretty quiet in there meaning the cooks probably prepared some of the items too far in advance. The bread was harder then a crouton and literally crumbled into dust when you bit into it. The pizza was good but not great. The wait staff was good and was on top of our needs. Due to this lesser of experiences I most likely will not be back next year when I'm in Vegas which is sad to say as I love Pizza.",

We decided on the large 18in pizza with chicken sausage and mushrooms. Then, ordered a carafe of their house red wine for $15. The wine was not very good on its own, but will likely pair nicely with the pizza.  When it arrived, the pizza looked really tasty and couldn't wait to take a bite. I was in pizza heaven with the first taste. The crust was thin and some what chewy. Then, the sweet and somewhat spicy sauce was added to the crust in mindful clusters, no haphazard slopping on of sauce here. The yummy mozzarella was applied in a similar manner. Lastly, the chicken sausage added a delicious meaty and spicy fennel note.  I was right, the marginal carafe wine really paired nicely with the pie by bringing out the spicy fennel and cutting through the cheesy mozzarella.  Grimaldi's, I must confess, your pizza, in my humble opinion, is easily the best in Las Vegas, possibly my favorite of all time. Can't wait for my next visit to pizza nirvana.",

I usually prefer a good amount of sauce on my pizza, but the pizza still had good sauce, flavor, and crunch.   Our salad was plenty and enough for 3 good servings between my girlfriend and I.

    "text": "How did this place get a 4 star rating?   We ordered a large pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms for pick up since we were too lazy to go to a restaurant. Upon first glance, the pizza looked extremely soggy for something that just came out of the oven a few minutes before. The smell of the pizza was very off putting as the cheese had a strange bitter aftertaste. The pepperoni looked and tasted like frozen pizza quality. I could barely muster in two slices before I called it quits. Everything just tasted like a mushy, soggy mess and almost uneatable. Pizza Hut would've been so much better...  This is NY style pizza gone wrong. Way wrong.   +1 for being located right downstairs from my hotel room",

    "text": "I'm usually skeptical about chain restaurant pizza. However, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a different story. I haven't been to their original Brooklyn location, so i'm not sure how True they stay to their original recipe. However, I do know good pizza when I taste it and Grimaldi's in Las Vegas is excellent.   The pizza at Grimaldi's is prototypical NY style pizza with a thinner crust. The crust is thin and airy, but still maintains its structural integrity without being bogged down by toppings. In addition to the traditional red sauce, you have the option of getting white garlic or pesto pizza. Our group of 4 shared 2 large (18  inch) pizzas, one traditional and one white garlic. My favorite pizza was the red sauce meatball pizza. It was addictive. I wasn't as big of a fan of the white garlic pizza.   Surprisingly, I don't believe there is any price inflation at this Las Vegas location and the prices are similar to other Grimaldi's. It is actually pretty affordable in comparison to other sit-down restaurants on the strip. A large pizza is $16 and consists of 8 slices. Toppings are extra and run you $2-4 each.  We also ordered a large salad to share and a few beers. We ended up paying around $25  each, which was a steal since we were all stuffed afterwards. Grimaldi's is a definitely a good option if you're looking for a casual, low-key sit-down restaurant on the strip that does not break the bank.",

The spinach salad with bacon is delicious. I always order a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I've tried the calzones and those are great as well. Their crust is amazing. So you can never go wrong.  I noticed they do have some gluten free options available, so that's great for those with gluten intolerance.  Make this part of your pizza rotation!",

Thin, with a little chew to it, but the edges are crispy as they should be!   The sauce is amazing. It tastes so fresh and natural, like the person that makes it actually puts their heart into it!   The toppings are just right. We ordered 10 pizzas (large group).  The fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce combo is hard to beat, but meatball ricotta was a close second. Sausage and mushroom was also very flavorful. Every pie has just the right amount of toppings on it. You don't make a mess picking it up and you don't feel heavy when you leave.   I will come here every single time I am in Vegas if I have a chance. The only other pizza that is almost as good is Secret Pizza.",

    "text": "In Vegas from NY for the ET marathon and decided to carb up on pizza.  Having been fortunate to have been able to eat at the Grimaldi's mothership under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC, I was psyched for some of the best slices you can get. On this visit the pie was good but not a \"NYC pie\" they did not properly cook the crust using the super hot coal fired oven, it is fully cooked and flavorful but no charring of the bottom crust and a few charing spots on top as they do in the Brooklyn.  Doesn't mean you have to be prepared that way the pizza is still good just not prepared as the original Grimaldi restaurant does it. You get the pizza the way you and your family like pizza by all means.  For those looking for craft beer to accompany their pie, will be disappointed. Red wine selections were just \"Meh\"also. Small antipasto was good but lived up to its \"small name\". Takeaway from this review is that on our last night in town we tried the restaurant again but this time requested it made \"Brooklyn\" style crust, a bit burnt and it was notably better, yum.  Looking for a True NYC style pizza? Ask for a bit of a burnt NYC style crust.  The Bartender knew exactly what we were talking about.  I understand why the restaurant doesn't make their pies in this style as a default as many would say it is overcooked but for those who want a original NYC pie experience, step out of your comfort zone and try it, its just a pizza.  The house salad was a surprise hit and a good yummy accompaniment on our second visit. Will definitely comeback on our next visit in Vegas.",

They had both in their chef selection. So we ordered it and I added chicken and green peppers on the garden pizza (she's not a vegetarian she just wanted the veggies and didn't mind the chicken). Pizza was bland and watery. Server was inattentive. Most expensive pizza we had. I don't mind paying for a $25 12-inch pizza (x2) if it's delicious and hits the spots - this one missed.",

It had such a wonderful, sweet flavor, with lots of fruit - like dessert! So much so that my friend ordered a sangria for herself after tasting mine.  Their server took my order almost immediately, brought me a water, and even asked if my drink would be on the table's check or if I'd like my own. We were ready to go before we'd finished our sangrias, so our server offered to put them in to-go cups - oh, how I love Vegas. For the next hour or so, as I finished my drink, other people at our convention kept asking me where they could get such a fruit-filled sangria... It still looked fabulous in a plastic cup!",

The three of us pull in and get seated immediately. The place smells great and we are hungry! We decide to share a large kale salad and a 16-inch \"Garden\" combo pizza plus some Italian sausage added. The service was great; the drinks and the very large salad arrived quickly.  The salad was delicious and just the kind of healthy that we were looking for.  \"E\" said that the kale was not \"massaged\" enough; I'm not even clear on what that means, but observed that we polished off the whole bowl in a couple of minutes. The pizza came out and looked great, but I knew as soon as I tried to serve a piece, that all was not good. While the toppings were fresh, the pizza as a whole was soupy, the crust soggy. It was some good ingredients that did not come together as a pizza. Toppings slid off if the spatula was not held perfectly horizontally. As I said, we were hungry so we ate it all, but we were disappointed by that 'pizza'. I do NOT reiterate my brother's recommendation.",

When we finally were seated, the waitress, came over and wanted to start a conversation about where we variously were from, and our reasons for visiting Vegas. We  just wanted to eat.  The waitress appeared offended that we weren't enchanted by her (Southern?) hospitality; and her response to our request for expedience, was to bray information regarding our food options, at high speed and volume   Braying at an almost painful level seemed to be her preferred manner of communication. I think that speaking at the same speed as the pe xqople who read the legal copy at the end of commercials was her special gift to us only.  The food was mediocre and not particularly memorable.  I found a foreign object (different ingredient) in my food, and when I pointed it out, the waitress told me that all the topping ingredients are in the kitchen, so sometimes they get mixed in accidentally.  Incorrect response. \"Oh, sorry\" would have been so much better.  I don't enjoy being patronised, and it becomes more annoying when the person taking the high ground has an inability to sense how to behave in varying situations.  This place doesn't get my customary second visit because I never want to encounter this awful woman again.",

    "text": "My first slice of pizza in NYC was at the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. I was never really a pizza person before (don't judge too hard please - having grown up in LA, all the pizza was kinda subpar), but one bite of Grimaldi's had me spiraling down a pizza rabbit-hole of obsession. I was HOOKED and I had Grimaldi's to thank. Since my first pie at Grimaldi's many many years ago, I've taken all my friends who visited NY to Grimaldi's for that quintessential NYC pizza heaven.   And I was super stoked to find the Grimaldi's in Las Vegas. The hype and expectation were so real and so high - and I'm so happy to report that Grimaldi's in LV did not disappoint.   Crust = perfect achievement of thin and substantive. And supposedly the Grimaldi's kitchen takes its dough so seriously that it hires chemists to replicate the water pH and chemical balance of NYC so that the same water is used in their dough everywhere!  Sauce = ugh. so goooooooooood. Sweet and savory, without being overly empowering of either.   CHEESE = fresh. SO FRESH and that mozzarella was so melt-in-your-mouth that I'm still singing about it!  Between the two of us, the personal pizza (12'') was plenty! Plus we got a little greedy and ordered the Caprese Salad as an appetizer.   **DO NOT GET THE CAPRESE SALAD - the tomatoes tasted old and bland. The cheese was good, but the tomatoes were such a letdown, and I'm just relieved that the tomatoes in the pizza were bursting with flavor.   GET THE PIZZA. Forget the other stuff on the menu. The pizza is where the taste & the money's at!!",

Vegas during this trip really let me down and it was our last night and I was feeling sick... sneezing and coughing and just totally over it. In fact that morning between being sick and seven days of being in stupid casinos full of smoke I literally couldn't taste anything! The hubby got some sort of mocha concoction at Starbucks and I was like oh what is this a low fat latte? Lol.  So annnnyways, I wasn't in the mood to go anywhere or do anything. The hubby being the best hubby ever, offered to run across the blvd and pick up a pie for us to split. Given the options of insanely over priced room service food which was bound to be awful we figured even bad pizza is decent in the end! So we called in an order for a large \"the don\" and let me tell you it was delish! Topping of pepperonis and meatballs were plentiful! The cheese was googey and perfect. And while the crust was on the thin New York style it was still hitting the spot.  Oh and cuz we couldn't fish it all that night... it made for a delicious breakfast cold the next morning too ;)",

I love the texture and crust of the pizza but the tartness of the ricotta cheese dulled the flavor of the italian sausage.

The interesting thing is that this place serves a NY style pizza and I haven't even had a pizza this good when I was in NY.   Their LOCATION is on the second floor above the casino of the Palazzo Hotel which is a prime location if you're staying on the strip and don't have a car.   As for the PIZZA, it's NY style thin crust pizza but wow, what a crust. Not too soggy, not too crispy but just right. The ingredients tasted fresh and it's not too greasy either. On top of everything, THE PRICE is awesome. My friend and I ordered an 18incher (we ate the whole thing)for less than 20 dollars.  With the extra toppings that we ordered it came to a little over 20 but that's still cheaper than Papa John's.   The ENVIRONMENT is pretty huge with a NY style of decor.  They have a standard bar and dine in area towards the back.   The SERVICE was good, however we did go at a pretty slow time. The pizza came out in a very reasonable time and our server was friendly.   Overall, I have to give them 5 stars because I think I will make it a tradition to eat here every time I come back to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "When you walk into the Palazzo from the Wynn bridge, you will smell an awesome Italian-pizza-tomato sauce smell, and Grimaldi's is where it's coming from. After striking out at a few other places on Friday night, we remembered that smell and followed our noses.  It turned out to be a pretty good idea.    Pizzas are cooked to order in a wood-fired pizza oven.  It has standard Italian pizzeria decor and they can accommodate fairly large groups, as there are some bigger tables there.  Plus most of the seats have a pretty good view of the bridge entrance of the Palazzo.   The basic large pizza is what you get for a flat fee, and then each topping is a couple extra dollars.  If you keep it simple, it is very affordable.  Like a proper pizza, everything is thin crust. They only have traditional toppings, like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, et cetera - you won't find any pineapples here!  The cheese is real pieces of fresh mozzarella, not shredded generic cheese.  So you won't have complete cheese coverage, but it will be great.  The salads you can order are also family style and fairly large.  They are worth it.   Overall if you are looking for an affordable,simple, and tasty pizza, this place is a good bet.",

    "text": "Man, after seeing all of these four and five star reviews, I feel like I must have really missed something.  I had heard of Grimaldi's and planned on trying them when I make it out to NY, but I was more than happy to check out their Palazzo location when our group of seven dropped in for lunch.  Legit NY pizza in Vegas?  Sure, why not?  Unlike a lot of pizza restaurants, Grimaldi's menu doesn't include any preset combinations or house specials (though they also offer salads and calzones).  Instead, you first choose the size and sauce base you want (regular, white with garlic, and pesto), then add on whatever toppings you like.  With two dozen to choose from (ranging from $2-$5 each), the possibilities are nearly endless!  After taking our server's recommendation for a small (it's perfect for two), my friend and I decided to share a Small White Pizza with Garlic ($16) and topped it with Italian Sausage (+$2), Mushrooms (+$2), and Green Peppers (+$2).  As far as taste goes, the pizza wasn't bad.  The toppings were decent and plentiful, and the white garlic sauce was solid.  Unfortunately though, I thought the crust/dough was disappointing.  While I liked how it was on the thin side, I wasn't a fan of the taste (somewhat bland) or the texture - neither doughy nor crispy and almost wafer like (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#KxHxBodbVP3RZ6GHtw2fAw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/grim...</a>).  In addition to our own, I also got to try a slice of my other friend's Personal Regular ($9) with Anchovies (+$2), Green Peppers (+$2), and Jalapeno (+$2).  The crust on his was slightly better, but the tomato sauce didn't do it for me (I generally prefer white sauce pizzas).  And while his mix of toppings may seem odd, they actually worked okay despite the anchovies being pretty salty (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#79Jq5QbDxfeb3U5zJ8Gk9Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/grim...</a>).  Even though the pizza didn't do it for me, I can sort of see why Grimaldi's is so highly received.  Given their reputation, the Yelp reviews, and the apparent superiority of their original locations, I'll give Grimaldi's another chance when I'm in NY.  With lower expectations, perhaps their Brooklyn bridge location will do the trick.",

Thd coan oven is most likley a marketing gimmick. Probably gas lighted oven through fake coals .. like a fake fireplace ...   Either way the gluten free pizza is so awful and dry. I don't even want to finsih this garbage. So dry and tasteless. I will likely throw it out.   Good thing there are so many drunks in Vegas. ANYTHING tastes good when you're drunk.

The slices I had before the attack were delicious, and in the morning for breakfast they tasted just as good. Thank you for handling that situation the way you folks did, I'm prone to anxiety attacks, and you folks really helped me stay calm. The Palazzo is crazy impressive in all areas.",

Pepper, one water). We had to go up to the hostess to move to a bigger table for a extra person after not seeing our waitress. When she did show back she saw one of on a phone and said she will come back when we were done. Instead she was busy with other tables. By the time we were ready for the check we told her we would like to split it up. She said we needed to tell her before we ordered and we would have to do the math ourselves. So after dividing up a 108.63 check she took only the cards first then came back with a check for the cash... we watched how she took time with other tables of less and more customers. Pizza was decent just service was horrible, the hostess was nice though.",

It had weird blobs of something unattractive (not sure if it was the sauce or the garlic we got on the pizza) that made it difficult to want to eat the whole pizza. The cheese seemed of relatively low quality and the sauce was literally flavorless. I was a bit worried when I looked at their website and saw a Hormel company seal.

You should know how most people feel about Sundays in Vegas. My friend ordered the Margherita pizza and I thought it was okay. The sauce seemed really bland. I am not really a fan of pizza with bland pizza sauce. The pizza's dough didn't really grab at me either. The crust was thin and you can actually watch some of the staff toss pizza. I think the place is good about accommodating large groups and the staff are pretty chill. I also learned they do not have ginger ale but they can attempt to make ghetto ginger ale. The keyword is 'attempt' Ghetto ginger ale consists of Sierra Mist with a splash of pepsi. My friend who ordered this concluded does not taste like Ginger ale. Not really sure why they bother. They should flat out say no and not offer this option. I gave it three stars cause the staff was chill but really food wise I would give it two. I am not really all that intrigued to come back.",

Meanwhile, tables that arrived after us were starting to receive their drinks and salads, etc. Each brief, frenzied contact with our server gave the impression that we were inconveniencing her. Last straw? As we finally got ready to place our pizza order, she literally turned to another table. We literally got up and left.   No one's pizza is *that* good.",

    "text": "I'm going to say it and I say it proudly... Grimaldi's pizza is the best pizza I've ever had up till now... it's ruined other pizza for me.  Staying at the Palazzo I noticed the advertisement billboard for it in the elevator lobby and didn't think much of it until we had our family over the hotel visiting and instead of eating out we decided to order to go and eat in our Bella Suite.  I have no idea what the pizzeria looks like and really don't care because on taste alone, it can be cooked on a cookie sheet and a lighter as long as it tasted that good.  I couldn't place what kind of cheese was used but I think it was manchego cheese along with the pepperoni and oh the spice, the spices just made for the best slice of pizza I've ever had.     I can't wait to return to Vegas just to have the pizza, this time I will eat at the pizzeria.",

Will definitely stop back when in the area.",

Do they really ship the water for the pizza all the way from NYC? No, but after having the pizza here, I'd believe it. According to their website, they actually hired \"...a chemist to analyze and recreate the mineral content and exact composition of the water.\"  I had a large pepperoni pizza with sausage on half of it and mushroom on the other half. It was everything you expect New York pizza to be. So so good! I loved the thin crispy, slightly burnt crust and the quality ingredients. The the mini pepperonis were just perfect with the sausage. I don't normally eat the crust but it was that good.  My absolute favorite pizza place. If only I lived in Vegas. Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, there is rarely a wait. If you love good pizza, especially New York style pizza,  you won't be disappointed.",

Pie was cooked right, thin crust New York style pie.  Crispy bottom crust, good ratios of fresh mozz and just the right amount of sauce.  Came out hot, just the way I like it.   First, the Don.  Basically a meat lovers with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs.  Proteins were generous but didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked.    Now the kalamata olive and basil half.   MOTHER OF GOD.    Perfection on a pie.  I know it doesn't sound that great, but seriously, just try it.  I had huge reservations about a pie with no proteins as well when a Long Islander recommended it to me, but it is soo money and you don't even know it.",

You know a pizza is really good when you're cravings for it seconds, minutes, hours, days after. OMG, I wish I can get a slice now.   A group of us were staying at Palazzo and one of the best thing about palazzo is being able to get our pizza and take it upstairs. Not just any pizza, one of the best pizza voted on food network. We ended up ordering two large pizza and a Caesar salad.   If you like thin crust pizza. This will be your heaven. The toppings and sauces and the way they cook it is like no other. It's just so delicious. I also love that they cut big slices cause one slice is like two slices. However, you can trick yourself that you have only eaten one slice and can go back for more. Love it.   The pizza we picked out had meatballs, pepperoni, pesto, and mushrooms. It was a wonderful combination. I would order it again.   This place is a for sure stop in Vegas. Luckily, we are allowed to eat anything and everything when we are on vacation. :)",

Very tempted to order the pizza of the month, the prosciutto pizza, but I can't say no to pesto. Pizzas were just as good as I remembered. Our server Ty was awesome, making sure we were okay and keeping our drinks filled. I made sure to leave room for dessert, so an order for the Bailey Irish Creme Cheesecake was placed. I can't believe I didn't know they had dessert available. It's definitely not on the menu online! Very decadent and yummy!   This place is just as good as the NY original and I'm stoked they have a location in SoCal (El Segundo!). I'm also in love with their decor---empty wine bottles as hanging light fixtures? Amazing.",

Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had.   I went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.",

Grimaldi's is the best, every time I've stayed at the palazzo my family and I eat here at least once, the food is always fresh, this time I had a salad and the Don pizza everything was fresh and flavorful. Everyone left happy and full, the staff is friendly, prompt, kept the drinks full and was on top of things. Thank you! Keep up the good work!!!!",

Crispy crust perfectly complemented toppings, affordable but quality Italian wines, fab cocktails, good service, really can't recommend this place highly enough.

They serve New York style pizzas, I think a large, which should fill up 2 people very comfortably if not 3, cost $16.  Most veggie toppings are $2 extra, some are $4.    We got a large pizza with mushrooms and onions, I had 2 and a half slices.  I was pretty full, but I would've eaten more just because it tasted so good.  The sauce was amazing, tangy and slightly sweet, crust was crunchy, and I could taste the toppings.  I've been to Vegas several 6 times in the past year and a half, and this is one of the best food deals I've come across.  You won't be disappointed.",

Sure you got sushisamba but it gets pretty loud and there is grand lux but let's be honest that menu is the last thing i wanna read at the end of a long nite! If i wanted to read a novel, i'd read my harry potter books. So this place is simple and delicious. Our bartender was very patient and tentative to our every need...well to my friends every need and was he needy! We got a small pizza which was bigger than i expected! Its good for 2-3 people. We ordered the house salad which was soo good. They really made a simple salad taste scrumcious! It was one of the best house salads i've ever had. The ingredients on the pizza were fresh. Definitely a return visit soon!!!!",

The Margareta (standard pizza there) w/ Xtra Basil is what we had. We also had the Spinach salad. Both were HUGE and fantastic. The small pizza is 16\". Looked like a large. The Spinach salad was fresh and fantastic. This was the cheapest and most filling meal we had in Vegas.",
