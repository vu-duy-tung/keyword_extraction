    "text": "I was first introduced to this restaurant a couple years ago when my realtor took me to eat & have drinks for Cinco de Mayo. It was awesome!! Recently my friend was coming in town for his birthday so I called to make reservations and request a table with a nice view....I could tell the guy I spoke with (I can't remember his name) was barely paying attention to me....and something told me he would have something messed up... When we arrived...they didn't even have a reservation at all!!!!!!! They asked me if I was sure I called the right location! I'm 100% sure I called this location in Henderson. However we were seated (in a corner table) and I had to stress about how I would tell them it was my friends bday so they could come out and sing to him (and embarrass him a little lol) ..... The waiter was actually really great!! And the food was real good.....so....this is why I left 4 stars. Maybe it was an honest mistake when I called....I realize things happen.... I definitely plan on going back sometime soon, the food is so good !!!",

I've tried a few different ones but I'd go with the Patron Perfect Margarita. The chips and salsa are good, nice heat on the salsa! The bean dip is tasty and our son loves the Fideo Soup that comes with the entrees.   My wife got the Toro a la Coca-Cola. It was good but very rich. I ordered the Puntas de filete Albanil which was killer! You need to like some heat because the jalapenos are fresh but it was great. The New York steak was juicy and the onions perfectly carmalized. I'll have a tough time switching away from that dish! Service is always good too!",

It was the worst ceviche I've ever had. Had absolutely no flavor and soaked in water .. completely over priced for that type of service and flavorless food. I was extremely disappointed . The manager did take off all of our ceviche orders , which was nice. But I won't be going back there.",

Let's just say that friends make sure that friends eat at Lindo Michoacan.   Aside from an amazing view of the Las Vegas area, the food and service are spectacular.  Everything cooked fresh and to order. The staff is friendly and attentive. I ordered the Tamale (\"Tamal\" in their menu) and Enchilada combo.  My first bite into the Tamale told me what I needed to know about this place. We even ordered a dozen Tamales to take back to our room for the rest of our stay. They have 3 locations but we went to the Henderson location as that is what my friend suggested as we were returning from our Hoover Dam tour. Make the trip to this restaurant. It will be worth it!",

    "text": "Overview: This is the perfect place for someone who likes Mexican food, but doesn't really like Mexican food. The food is tastes but it's not amazing. The atmosphere is really fun and great for groups. Plus the city light views at night are awesome.   Chilli relleno: Usually this is my go-to choice when I'm eating Mexican so, being from Tucson I've had many amazing rellenos in my life. The ones at Lindo are just okay. The breading is pretty soggy and the cheese inside the pepper is not always melted and there isn't a lot of cheese to being with.   Guacamole: this is something Lindo does amazingly. I would come here just for the guac. It's the perfect balance of onions, jalapenos and cilantro. And the avocados they use are always top notch ripe. Not fruity at all. So, so good.   Vegetable Fajitas: this is another one of my favorite dishes. I was surprised when they brought out the vegetables and there were carrots and cauliflower along with the sauteed peppers and onions. A little unconventional but they were all still very good. Their tortillas, flour and corn are both super good so you can't go wrong with choosing either of those.   Margaritas: the peach margarita is really delicious. But be warned, all their margaritas are very sweet, and can be strong so you can get yourself into a heap of trouble if you drink then too quickly. Overall, they are worth it. But if you are looking for less sweet and more lime, look somewhere else, or ask specifically for what you want.   Other things that you can look forward to here are the refried beans and salsa they bring out to your table with tortilla chips as an app are super good. I could fill up on chips and beans alone and call it a night.   All in all, if you are looking for Mexican food for a good price, but you want to sit down in a fun restaurant, this is the place for you. But if you are looking for authentic, super high quality, you are better off trying a different spot. Lindo provides, quick, yummy, comfort, Mexican food, good views, a fun environment and relatively strong drinks. So you won't be in awe over your meal but you will leave happy and full.",

The chili verde is tender and well seasoned.   The chips are fresh and crispy.  The salsa is spicy and just darn good.  Whenever we have friends in town this is a must visit for us.",

Many years ago when I first moved to Las Vegas, the food knocked your socks off. The salsa ect was spucy and full of flavor. They have changed so much. For Mexican food they're overpriced. The best thing they have is there fresh-made guacamole because you can have it spiced however you like it. Everything else I've ordered in the last few years is incredibly bland. I really wanted to like this place Now it seems they are charging for the atmosphere and a Mexican experience but the food is not authentic and delicious anymore. They have dulled down the flavor and made a vanilla brand of Mexican food. It isn't awful but I prefer Mexican food they way they used to make it. This generic flavor as of late is not for me.",

I use to frequent this restaurant at least once a month, but this year my visits dwindled to twice. After the trip tonight, hoping it could redeem itself, I will not be going back. The salsa was awful, it had a very metallic flavor, and even though my husband and I ordered 2 compliantly different dishes ( chili Colorado and taco salad) they both tasted exactly the same. Bland and flavorless. I sat there at the table trying my best to stomach my salad, adding the table side guacamole, salt, pepper, anything and everything I could (not the salsa) and nothing I did helped. It all tasted exactly like NOTHING (with salt and pepper). I honestly don't have any idea why they have gone from awesome to awful, but I will most certainly never be going back.",

    "text": "This review is based upon the experience of my girlfriend and I as we tried Lindo Michoacan. We arrived around 8:30 for a late dinner, so our experience may not be reflective of lunch or earlier dinner services.   Front of the House: Approaching the restaurant there were many cars parked along the road but the parking lot had a couple spots open. On our way to the front door (it was rather loud) and when the doors opened it become nearly uncomfortably loud. There was some live music while a cow bell was being rung to celebrate someone's birthday. While it appeared to be rather busy, we were seated quickly. The table we were brought to had no placemats out and the hostess put those on while we watched, but only a spoon and fork for utensils, no knives. The service started off poor service. On a positive note, the napkins, while not cloth, are thick and large, certainly of higher quality than many other restaurants. The service improved slightly through dinner but remained below average and certainly below expectations. The attire of the wait staff gives a mixed message. The hostesses (only female) were wearing \"traditional Mexican dresses\" while the waiters (did not see a single female waiter) were more mixed. About 2/3 of them were wearing semi-formal attire, button up long sleeve dress shirts with ties, some in white and some in all black which itself gave different impressions. However, the remaining one-third wore pants with t-shirts advertising the restaurant which portrayed a much less formal atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is very open which only increases the ambient volume. Part of the kitchen is open which is appealing and informative. One side of the dining room is covered with a glass wall with a beautiful view of the Las Vegas valley. While waiting to be seated one can watch the cook staff make flour tortillas through the open kitchen, however, the tortillas are being rolled out with a rolling pin instead of by hand which is traditional. The kitchen area was clean and generally well organized. The anti-skid mats were a bit unevenly placed leaving some spaces of open floor where staff could slip.  Food: Tortilla Chips with Chile Salsa and Refried Bean Dip: Shortly after we were seated arrived some tortilla chips with chile and refried bean dips. Disappointingly, the chips were at room temperature rather than heated and even moreso the bean dip was incredibly bland. One might think the mellow bean dip would go well with a hot and spicy chile sauce, however, the lack of flavor in the bean dip make for a dissatisfying combination. (Notably, the refried beans that came with the entree were significantly more enjoyable and flavorful, as will be addressed later). The chile salsa appeared mostly chunky with some oil floating on the surface. The appearance and aroma were not particularly out of the ordinary, but neither were particularly remarkable. The flavor seemed incredibly lackluster, no notable hint of spices aside from the chiles themselves were present, to the point where there was almost no taste. There was the expected after effect of heat but that is all there was, pure heat. If you happen to be a fan of hotter chiles, the mild heat will be the final disappointing aspect of the complimentary appetizer. Quesadilla de Maiz con Carne: The appetizer came plated with two small, 5 to 6 inches in diameter, both cut into 4 unequal pieces, additionally there, was some guacamole and sour cream provided. The corn tortillas tasted the same as previous I have had and were very similar to Guerrero brand tortillas but were much less uniform than mass-produced kinds. The Monterey Jack used was of nice quality and lent a very savory, yet mildly sweet quality to the the enchiladas. The steak was lightly seasoned which should have let the meaty flavor stand on its own. However, the lower quality of the meat combined with incredibly different sizes of the cut lead to a very uneven cooking, that could only be described as overdone, relegated the steak to more a texture, rather than taste. Sopa de Fideos/Fideo Soup: My girlfriend first described the soup as \"tomato water with oil,\" which after trying it repeated seems to be a succinct yet accurate description. The red soup lacks a strong aroma and one is immediately drawn to the large amount of oil along the top. There is a slight suggestion of tomato and earthy flavors but they are very diluted. The short vermicelli were the most tasteful part of the soup; very soft with a nice doughy taste.   A significant reduction in the liquid combined with just a bit of salt and some onion/garlic would have made for a much more flavourful soup.   Cont.",

    "text": "My wife and I needed something to bring to a friend's house for an appetizer. We had never been to Lindo Michoacan before and thought, \"we'll just quickly grab some chips, salsa, and guacamole to go.\" Boy were we wrong... I placed a take out order and the hostess said, no problem. The total came to $25 which is a little steep for chips, guacamole, and salsa, but the restaurant is close to where I live and we thought it would be a good crowd pleaser! After 30 minutes of waiting, I asked about my order. The hostess checks and says \"oh just a few more minutes.\" Another 10 minutes goes by, and still nothing. I ask again. She apologizes and goes to the kitchen to check on the order. She comes back and says, \"it'll just be a few minutes.\" At this point, I ask for a manager. When the manager comes out, I fill him in. Explain that I ordered chips, salsa and guacamole to go more than 40 minutes ago. He apologizes and goes to the kitchen to check on the order. When he returns, without my order, he says, \"It'll be about 5 more minutes.\" Are you kidding me? Since when does it take 45 minutes or longer to get a quick to-go order?! At that point, I tell him nevermind and I'd like a refund so I can be on my way. He says, \"You don't want to wait for your order?\" I almost laughed. Waiting is all I had been doing. And no, I was done waiting. He processed my refund, apologized, and I left. Needless to say, I will not be back.",

    "text": "First things first:  in spite of giving only three stars, I want to go back.  I want to give it another try because we really enjoyed the food and drinks and would like to try that again.  My meal was simple; I had two beef tacos and a cheese enchilada.  It came with a tomato-based noodle soup that we both enjoyed, plus rice and beans.  My husband had some kind of chile relleno with shrimp, which was delicious--both of our meals were very good, and we both enjoyed Cadillac Margaritas on the rocks.  Everything came in a timely manner.  The drawbacks:  we made a reservation at 7:00, and arrived a few minutes before.  First the hostess says she does not have our reservation.  No one called, no...oh wait, the spelling is what?  (I should add that our last name is very simple and common.)  Oh, okay, well...wait just a few minutes.  The place was packed, hot, and very very loud.  There was nowhere to sit to wait, and \"a few minutes\" stretched into 45--at which point we went to the hostess and told her we were leaving.  \"I'm seating you right now!\" she told us, and they did come within 3 minutes after that.    After that, things were much better, as stated above.  Things we disliked:  the confusion about the reservation, the long wait, the NOISE--it's so very noisy!--and the restroom could have been better maintained.  This seems to be a family place, so look out for a LOT of kids.  One other thing I had a problem with:  the menu is huge and the restaurant lighting is fairly low, and the small, red print is very difficult to read in that light.  But we will go back, probably much earlier than 7 - 8pm, because that seems to be when the rush is.  I'd like to try the guacamole...and I'll be taking a flashlight so I can see the menu!",

This sauce is supposed to be the spiciest sauce they make. The heat kick from this sauce is pretty intense, especially on the next day. The steak I had ordered was medium-rare. The quality of the meat was pretty good and it was cooked perfectly. You do loose the flavors from the juices of the meat due to the heat, but it was a Mexican place and I had low expectations for the steak.  We ordered a table side guacamole, which was made fresh in front of us. The drinks were good, I would recommend trying their mango margaritas.",

I was lucky enough to circle the lot a few times and find a spot.   We arrived at around 5pm on Saturday night. For our table (2 people) we were told the wait time would be 20-25 minutes. Right around 25 minutes our table was ready.   We were served the complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip. Salsa had a good kick to it. The bean dip was served warm and was a little bland in my opinion.   I ordered the veggie fajitas. The veggies were served on a sizzling platter. It seemed that there were more onions than any other vegetables.   The homemade flour tortillas were phenomenal. While the meal was only served with two the server offered us more.   Service was good. Our server was super attentive and friendly.   All in all the food was OK, not sure if it was worth the wait.",

The menu at first was a bit overwhelming but the back page was all their lunch specials (36 of them LOL) and we all ended up picking from there.   One of my colleagues went with Taco Salad which was enormous and from the looks of it and his opinion delicious and they other (craving spicy) Camarones a la Diabla which was exactly the spice she was craving.  I went with their classic Carne Asada which was excellent. Steak was cooked just the way I wanted it and the sides were also good. All in all was an excellent meal and I will be coming back next time in the area.",

It is very close to the house, but we have always been disappointed.  The service is medicore at best, although you can see most of the employees are trying - they always seem to be understaffed. The food is .the worst version of American Mexican. The drink comp based on gaming requires a manager to review your bill, then they will only give the absolute minimum. How is this place a 3.5 stars.",

Idk if it's always so hot in there but when I went I was sweating!! I'm never hot so that tells me it was extra warm. Service was OK but I expected it on the crowd size. There was an incredible downtown view if you can get lucky enough to get it! Food was alright nothing to write home about and priced a little over reasonable. If I knew for sure the air was working and in the mood to be crowded I might consider going back. I ordered a torta and it was just meh . It had a good ambiance in there so maybe staying for drinks would've been better. Lost my pics ! Sorry",

First, what an awesome venue and location. Such a large roomy dining room I can see why so many people come here for celebrations. I read some of the other reviews and I think it's just unfortunate that some dishes didn't come out right. I think the food here is so good. The two times we have been here were great for us.   My daughter just loves the soup with the little noodles they give you as an appetizer. Eh forgot what it's called. Something like Fedeo. I got this steak called Novillo al Cognac. It had this cream sauce with mushrooms and onions on it and it was one of those steak meals I will remember forever. Man it was so good.   The only knock with this place is that service can be a little slow at times. But I am not going to take away a star for that. The restaurant gets really busy. Just come here for an awesome setting, great food and take your time and have a chillaxing meal. Love this place.",

I can not say one bad thing about it. It has been consistent every time. The servers are on point and attentive here. Authentic Mexican flavors and menu done just right. Yes! Yes! Yes!  THE BAD: It is a loud place and the waiters YELLING (not singing) Happy Birthday songs to guests every 5 minutes gets very annoying and very old, very fast. The yelling rips away the romance, the food and the great view of the strip the restaurant has,..Rips it right off your face.  THE UGLY: The casino games at the bar. Terrible idea. It cheapens the experience by a lot. I'd rip those ugly machines off that bar if i could. A nice and elegant bar with no machines in sight to sit at with a date would be heavenly at this location. I may be asking for too much in LV but gosh, it cheapens the place up. I will certainly come back until i find another Mexican restaurant i like that does not have servers yelling birthday songs and without casino games.   Because of the singing and the casino games I am currently in search of spending my money elsewhere, if any one has any suggestions for similar food quality and taste, message me.",

The staff was always available with more chips and salsa, drinks,  napkins--whatever we needed.   The food was well presented,  very hot and delicious. Everything tasted as if it was prepared in house. For sure the tortillas were, because they make them right in front of you at the entrance to the place.

My boyfriend ordered chicken fajitas, I was not impressed. Maybe we ordered wrong but from previous reviews I was under the impression that they served authentic Mexican and it was a bit Americanized to my taste.  The service was horrible. We probably only saw our waiter three times: 1.) to take our order 2.) dropped off our food 3.) for the bill. We saw other servers more than we did our own and had to order drinks from the bar because he took to long to check on our drinks.  I liked the ambiance, scenery and view but it was lacking service.

It's SO noisy in this place you cannot even have a conversation with the person across the table with you, no lie, I had to move and sit next to my friend in order to be able to hear what she was saying. As soon as we had a great conversation going the server (Antonio) comes barging into our conversation HELLO ARE YOU READY TO ORDER? I mean what ever happened to a server that approaches quietly and waits for a chance to speak? He just barges up and interrupts my friend who just so happens to be talking about her sick husband. Please send your servers to server school so they can learn how to be courteous, attentive and not rude. Same for food runner, comes up interrupting the discussion and starts the food auction \"who had the quesadilla?\" So tacky, so rude and intrusive. If the server put the order in correctly the runner would not have to auction the food they'd know who ordered what. I wish restaurants would put effort into training their \"wait\" staff, it makes/breaks the entire experience. It's the WORST being rudely interrupted by wait staff, hence the name WAIT. The food. meh -- I've had better in many places around town. This place, with all due respect I am sorry but I am just being honest, is a zoo that I will never go to again, even parking is a nightmare.",

    "text": "When you come to a place that's got so much hype, you think you're gonna be blown away. You think you're gonna leave satisfied with the meal you just ate (especially for the price). What did this Lindo Michoacan location deliver? Just good drinks and semi good service. Oh, and the guacamole was pretty good.  I am not sure any suburb of Las Vegas (hell not even in Las Vegas), can you find a True authentic Mexican food joint. Quality just isn't there. For me, who's got family rooted to Michoacan, this place did not deliver at all. Definitely more of a \"show\" spot.   Their alcoholic drinks? Very well done. It seems that they bank on getting you in on 2-3 drinks in before serving you their food. Good tactic, but I like to eat. Meaning I taste my food and value it's quality.  I ordered the Fajitas de Gallina (chicken fajitas). The plate was just a regular fajita skillet, it looked good. I was really hoping for steak fajitas, but was quickly discouraged due to the lack of them actually having their steak fajitas made with flank steak. Anyone one who knows Mexican food will know that's Mexican steak. Not their \"New York\" strip steak they decided to substitute.   Back to the Fajitas de Gallina. I was very tempted to ask what frozen bag these came out of. They were as dry as dry could be. Short on seasoning, very shot on quality. Just definitely not worth what the plate cost.  My wife ordered the Chile Verde (pork). Although the sauce had flavor, the pork? Felt like you were bitting into rubber cubes. Don't ask me how bland their steak burrito was, it was like chewing on grilled tofu.   One star. That's it, that's the lowest I could give. They weren't concerned about our concerns with our food, no manager came out to ask what was wrong after the server was advised of the displeasure with our plates. Therefore? I can only provide one star.   Fix your quality of food, and don't rush your customers. We are your paycheck, we are your livelihood. We deserve better.",

I must say that their chips and salsa or not that great the bean dip is very tasty though and for dinner, they give you a small soup that's tasty  They have really good lunch specials and that's probably the best time to come here  I've been with enough people who love it and didn't like it at all. One thing I tell everybody is avoid being a basic don't order a taco or a Burrito or tostada/enchilada, order their specialties, anyone I've been with an order of the basic shit has not enjoyed their meal but if they order a speciality dish (they probably have 30-40 or more options , that's where this place shines,   I usually go with the pollo de ajo y ojo. Basically chicken with garlic and olive oil and you make your own burrito or taco. The rice and beans are average   If it wasn't for the service and the ambience, probably be a three star, but it's enjoyable enough and the food if you get the right thing on the right day can be very tasty.   One tip,  if you get a steak dish it is a good value for a few extra bucks to upgrade your steak to a ribeye I strongly suggest doing that it's makes a difference",

I read some of the reviews and was skeptical about my dinner experience here.  Needless to say I was taken aback by the view of the city, it was spectacular!  The view itself brings two stars to the table.  On to the food.  The portions were large and filled with flavor, unlike many Mexican food establishments that have very bland and flavorless offerings.  I had the Kikirriki (pronounced kee-keerree-kee), A grilled chicken breast with a semi spicy sauce, full of flavor.  My daughter had the fajitas and while there were no surprises here with the entree, the real surprise was with the tortillas, they did not have the texture and flavor of store bought, these actually had the texture and flavor of freshly made.  Taking a step backward, the servers brought out the obligatory chips and salsa, the salsa was flavorful and spicy, overall it was good.  The surprise here was a small bowl of refried beans came out as well to dip chips in, a nice touch.  The service was very prompt, courteous and we never waited or had to ask for anything.  Now, to be fair, the restaurant was semi busy for a Tuesday night but not overwhelming.  Overall, I am planning on going back on my next trip to the city in April.",

    "text": "The two stars are just for service and ambiance, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the view of Las Vegas is beautiful, the food lacks in taste and quality though.  I had high hopes when we pulled in to meet another couple for dinner as the parking lot was full.  The food is on the mild side which cater to milder palettes.  My friend ordered the marinated pork chops, expecting 3 succulent chops only to find 3 thin slices of pork chops, which looked as if a pork chop was sliced into three.  Her fiance ordered the green chili burrito combo asking for just beans, cheese, rice, and sauce since he is a vegetarian, but they added pork into it.  My bf ordered a cobb salad and enchilada a la carte and did not enjoy his meal.  I ordered the Carnitas Fajitas and did not enjoy the taste.  It did not taste fresh and it lacked flavor...tasted like it was never marinated and came out of a slow cooker.  I actually took it back to the hotel room and doused it with the salsa I had leftover from the catering truck we purchased our breakfast from earlier, which was much cheaper and had more flavor.  Since some other reviewers raved about the \"delicious and different corn tortillas\", I ordered those with my meal to find stale corn tortillas that were most likely store bought, not homemade at all.  While I was packing my takeout container, they staff quickly took the tortillas...maybe to reuse since mine tasted old and stale?  As far as the salsa and beans served with chips prior to ordering the meal, the chips were cold, salsa was very bland, beans were nothing remarkable.  The fideo soup actually did have good flavor, but lacked substance.  The atmosphere was also very loud with music, so it is not a place to gather for people who are trying to catch up.  They were very busy so I am sure they will not miss our business.  I have had much better Mexican food in other restaurants and taco shops/stands.",

    "text": "This place really impressed us on our last visit about a week ago. We had been here a few times before but this most recent visit prompted a review write up.  My father in law, his wife, and my husband and were seated very promptly for our early dinner (about 5:30pm) on a Saturday night. We were seated at a window table with an incredible view of the town. We were immediately greeted and our drink orders were taken. Renee and his team were ON THE BALL! our orders were taken, our drinks were always filled and chip bowls never empy. I never even had to request anything being the guys were VERY aware and observant of what was going on and never missed a beat in making sure we had everything. It really depends on preference but i did not feel they intruded or interrupted our dinner and conversations.  The meals were great, and always is so I dont get why people comment the food is not very good. I have tried multiple dishes and it has always been as good as any other nicer Mexican restaurant. Yes, the prices are higher, almost all shrimp dishes were 18.99 but you can get the combo meals towards the end of the menu at reasonable prices of about 11.00. This is not Roberto's, Cafe Rio or anything similar, this is a nice restaurant to expect to pay the price.   After finishing our meals, we continued to order drinks and Renee and his guys basically left us alone and we did not feel rushed so we took our time to enjoy the view, drinks, and great conversations.   I will say the only minimal downsides were the parking as usual, if you dont get there early, parking is very limited so you have to park at the parking lot across or along the street.  Also, there was a larger party seated somewhat close to us that had crying babies so that is not the restaurants fault but was a little distracting.   The overall experience definitely made for an excellent night out.  Try and get seating on either corner end of the restaurants where it has great views, feels a little more intimate, and is also quieter than the main center seating area.",

My mother is handicapped and the wait staff actually helped her walk thru the restaurant and down the stair to her seat and helped her again as we left.  It was extremely sweet of them to do that.  Dad usually does that but they insisted on helping. The view is great as well.  I made sure to make a reservation (called that morning) to request a table with a view.  It was a weeknight so there were fewer diners than peak times and that probably helped.  I love the food and am always satisfied every visit.",

I hate onions so the option to order fresh is a really big deal for me. I switch up my food options here and I've never been disappointed. If you love to drink, and lets be honest- who doesn't (besides my mother- hi mom), order a bulldog. It's a margarita with a beer in it so basically my idea of heaven on earth. They also give you this soup before your meal and I'm obsessed with it. I have one more thing to add (while I have your attention) it's one of those restaurants where they give you a free shot on your birthday so it's literally someone's birthday there every 5 minutes which I think is pretty funny. They also have really great views if you request a seat by the window.",

We finally were able to do that, since we came at sort of an off-time, (4:30 pm) which I highly recommend if you want to get a window seat. The food is good, but the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that to me, the soup is way too salty, and the chili relleno was just OK. The chips and dip were outstanding, as were the enchiladas. The service was very good, and, the Cadillac margaritas are quite nice!",

I called once during this time and changed the number from 11 to 12 and again explained the occasion and wanting a view table. The day of the birthday, they called me to be sure we were still coming.  I explained we were and that it was a very special occasion. They understood and everything was set.  We get there and are told it's 30 minute wait for our reservation.  So we stand by the bathrooms for 30 minutes waiting. We were finally called and told we could have a table in the middle of the restaurant now or wait ANOTHER 30 minutes for our reservation with a view. So much for making a reservation. Granted, they were busy, but they should have the table reservation system figured out by now. I would have given 1 star but I added another because the waiters/servers did a good job.",

So will comment about my henderson experience. Again I ordered the Carne asada burrito and a pepsi. I like to try staples to guide the quality of the meat etc. To start they give you some tasty bean dip and salsa and chips. The burrito itself required an up sell for rice and beans. I mean come on dude just add it in automatic. A burrito that only comes with meat and Pico de gaillo...eh a bit stingy..anyways the cuts of meat were very good and the burrito was good..however the place itself is a 10 and the ambiance and views are a worth whatever they charge which was within reason. .bottomless pepsi and my tummy was a happy camper..customer service was excellent...deducted one star for the nickel and diming on the beans and rice..I think it would better to just say it's 11.95 including beans and rice..if it had been so I would have given 5 stars so let's call this 4.5 stars for a minor annoyance...will return for sure :)",

    "text": "Husband and I were craving Mexican food. We wanted to relax and chill on our date night so we came across Lindo. I love the area, especially because it's close to us. I've heard many people rave about this place so we decided to try it!   As soon as we walked in, you can smell the deliciousness of the Mexican food. Hostess greeted us and were very friendly. It was a little loud, but we don't really mind the loudness. The atmosphere was really nice and kid friendly and the hostess sat us at a table with the best view of Vegas. It felt really nice.   It took us a few mins to go over the menu, which has plenty of choices from combos to ala carte. I ended up getting the 2 burrito combo which had shredded beef and tender pork with green sauce, served with Mexican rice, beans and a small portion of salad. Hubby got the 3 enchilada combo with beef, chicken and pork with the same sides. Both for $15 each.   As we were waiting for our food, they brought us home made crispy tasty tortilla chips with with mild or spicy salsa and bean dip which was yummy.   Once our order came to the table, the plate was super hot, we had to wait a bit. The portions were really big, I mean for $15 I'd hope they were big. So I took a bite out of my beef burrito and this is where my 4 starts come in. My beef burrito was really really dry and I'm not sure if it was that day they had over cooked it or that's really how they cook their beef. My pork burrito was very tender and was really tasteful and I loved it. Same thing goes for hubby's chicken and beef enchiladas.   Ordered tres leches cheese cake which was yummy. Other than that. I still yet have to try the rest of the food.",

I can't wait to go back for a dinner service!   The staff and ambiance provide an upscale, authentic Mexican atmosphere. The table offerings are fresh tortilla chips with a medium salsa and creamy bean dip. Their menu is extensive, but the notable aspect is undoubtedly their 32 lunch specials- all under $13, and numerically ordered in Spanish- such a fun touch! Portion sizes were huge! even for lunch, and everything had the homemade quality you expect from a True Mexican restaurant. I was extra impressed with their giant beef taco; I expected ground beef but received a mound of shredded beef topped with lettuce and fine cheddar cheese- the perfect blend of the more American style crispy taco and traditional Mexican flavors with the slow cooked beef.   My boyfriend and I went while he was on his lunch break; he is usually really reluctant to go to a sit down restaurant for lunch because of the obvious time concerns. After being scarred by one too many places during lunch, it starts to feel like \"shame on me\" for trying a full service result for lunch. Not the case at Lindo! Our entrees were out less than 10 minutes after ordering- no feeling rushed to scarf down your food, or even worse- having it immediately boxed as you pay the bill at the counter because it took so long.   Thanks for the outstanding and unique lunch experience! We will be back VERY soon to enjoy a dinner service with your unmatched views!",

It was tasty but was a pretty small portion-likely because it came off the lunch menu. The service was great - until our actual server arrived at our table. Other staff brought out the complimentary chips and dips. They only have Mexican beers on draft, which was kind of a bummer.  Our server was sloooooooooooooooooowww to come around and refill our drinks. Had no idea where he was or what he was doing. They set plates out for me and my wife to use for our appetizer, and mine had dried crusty something on it still. I had to ask one of the other staff members passing by to please bring me another plate since our server was off taking a nap somewhere, but that plate clean plate never arrived.  The food is SUPER salty...I probably gained 10 pounds of bloat from the meal. It's definitely tasty, but I've honestly had better from the plethora of Mexican restaurants throughout the valley. You pay for the view at this restaurant, which is spectacular. Unfortunately, the rest of the experience is not.",

I am not a Mexican food fan, but I go when I am requested too, I have tried a few dishes to include basic tacos , and they can't even get those right.   Very bland tasting meat and rice.     I will say my counter part ordered oysters and she did say they were delicious, but how can you mess up raw oysters :)   They do not have reservations, which is a huge downfall on a weekend.",

The crowds tell the story ( though they are very efficient, so the wait is never more than a few minutes ime )- it's a great place to have a meal.   I'd rate it about a 4.5, but since we're only whole numbers, I went for a 5 just because the service and staff are always really outstanding. Great chips and salsa too.  There are a lot of vegetarian options, though it's pretty disappointing that the soup they bring isn't vegetarian (chicken broth)...I guess on their side, it is authentic.  Anyhow, definitely a great place to have a sit-down meal.",

This particular location sits on top of a hill with a spectacular view of the Las Vegas strip and well as other nearby casino/resorts. Expect a short wait to be seated, they do get rather busy. However the service is fast and friendly, we had three servers attending to us. There were no mix ups, a single one forgetting about us nor did anyone seem frustrated with the dinner rush. My steak was cooked perfectly and to my desire however the lobster tail was a bit over done. It was good just a little dryer than I would like. They had a mariachi band playing and would go up to tables to play if it was a persons birthday or other celebration which included staff singing along.",

    "text": "My partner and I tried the Bonito Michoacan on Decatur a few days before we had a family invite here and I wasn't so impressed, so I thought it would be interesting to try a different Michoacan & might lead to a better experience. Unfortunately I was wrong. Pros first - What I DID like about this place is that it was very open and bustling, but all the while not too noisy that you couldn't enjoy the company you were with. It's in a perfect location too so you can see the city with the strip in the distance, which was really gorgeous. That's where the 2 stars came from. Cons - The good thing about Bonitos for me was the drinks, but unfortunately we weren't offered a drinks menu or anything other than water the whole time we were there. Really disappointing. Then the food. We went for the enchiladas and the carne asada. I was really hoping for something less gloopy and saucy this time after the poor experience at Bonitos, but.. nope! Another school dinner for us! The enchiladas were covered and it was all a bit bland and heavy. The carne asada was totally dry and going cold when we got it. We had to douse it in salsa verde so it would go down, but of course that made the whole thing cold. No check backs, so as it was edible we made do. It was a great evening in all because of the company we were with, but that had nothing to do with Lindos. Will not be returning to any of the Michoacans, if you're looking for Mexican cuisine, there is a lot better around the valley in my opinion.",

The bar is quite big with a ton of liquors and beer selection and tvs to watch the games on.   When you are seated, they bring you chips, a side of beans, and salsa. The beans were amazing, probably the best re-fried beans I have ever had. I liked that they did a little  more than just the chips and salsa, it was a nice touch. The salsa was really good too, you could tell it was homemade and not the crap out of a jar.  The menu had plenty of options, and everything looked so good it was hard to decide what to order. I ordered a combo that came with a tostada, enchilada, taco, and chili rellano. It also came with beans and rice. It was way too much food, but everything was delicious. We had a few margaritas as well, and they were good and had just the right amount of tequila.  Our server was extremely friendly and the other staff were super nice and actually seemed like they liked their jobs and were happy to be waiting on us. The ambiance is casual and authentic.   Great authentic Mexican food, with great margaritas, and great service!!!!",

I have been here about 10 times and some of the servers/wait staff here seem to be working here with some bad attitudes. The younger wait staff is usually really nice, but the guys i am complaining about look seasoned and tired. These guys will not only talk back to you, but also give you the roll of the eyes. This has happened to me with different servers at different occasions while addressing even the most minor of concerns (for ex. \"can we get some extra napkins?\"). I finally had enough of this treatment and addressed the bad attitudes with a floor manager last time i was there. He took care of our immediate issue himself but with no apology. I am not saying all servers here have bad attitudes, but at least 5 out of 10 act like old, tired, disrespectful \"macho\" men. My family and I have moved on to other restaurants because of this.  This is unfortunate because we really liked the rest of the staff and their food.",

So don't eat too much before your actual entre arrives!  We went on a Saturday night, so it was pretty busy. The wait wasn't too bad (about 45 minutes), but the parking was a hassle. My brother had to keep circling the lot while we waited outside. The lot is very small, but the view from there of Las Vegas is beautiful.  Because it was busy, the place was loud. It also seemed like 30 people or parties were celebrating birthdays there because the waiters and waitresses kept singing happy birthday, like, every ten minutes. So this is not the best place to really talk, unless you don't mind yelling over the noise. Maybe it's not as loud on less busy days.  Despite the hectic atmosphere, the service was prompt and everyone was polite and welcoming. I recommend this place for large groups. You'll have a good time.",

On our most recent visit our waiter checked on us frequently. There was always a staff member in our section making sure that every need and want was met.   The view here is awesome. The restaurant is situated on a hill so certain dining rooms offer a great view of the valley. There is also an outdoor area that offers a nice view.   The food isn't just the standard burritos and enchiladas even though those are awesome as well. The menu is huge and offers many more authentic options as well as the standard Mexican restaurant offerings. The chips and salsa that start each meal don't disappoint. I also enjoy the soup that comes with most of the meals. The food isn't as cheap as most Mexican restaurants, but I figure you're also buying the view.  This is an awesome spot for good Mexican food that makes you want to come back.",

I had the adobada taco dinner and my boyfriend had a chimichanga dinner. Both were super delicious and came with rice/beans and there noodle soup. Portions are large, and evreything is home made. Including the tortillas! We will be back!",

We had the tableside guac also, which you customize to your taste, and that was very tasty & fresh! I was pleased when \"beer girls\" came around offering a sample and a $2.75 bottle special!  That is always a nice bonus.  I also tried the shrimp cocktail, which lacked flavor (needed something spicy, cocktail sauce, etc.) but the shrimp were plentiful and good.

I'm giving it 3 stars because the service, location and view was amazing.  It was a busy Saturday night and believed because so many people were going, that the food must be great. We accepted any seat for 5 and got put into a booth with an extra chair placed at the end. We all felt very cramped. But ok, we're expecting good food and were snacking on chips, dip and salsa that was good, while enjoying the view and waiting for our food to arrive.  Then the food came. The presentation looked like it would be good, until you took a bite. I had the combination plate of a chicken tostada, taco and enchilada. Because the same chicken was used for all of it, they all had no flavor and the chicken was dry. I was looking for some lettuce just to have some flavor. Everyone else in my party  experienced the same and couldn't even finish their dishes. When we were asked if we wanted to-go boxes, we wanted to say \"hell-no\".  So, if you want a good place to have a drink with great view, Lindo Michoacan is the place. All the waiters and hostesses were nice. But if you want a chicken taco, go to Taco Bell or Del Taco for some flavor.",

My wife ordered a simple bean burrito enchilada style  I ordered a relleno stuffed with shrimp for  and our usual guacamole as an appetizer to start. Our whole meal was $44.00  Needless to say her burrito sauce tasted from a can not the normal enchilada sauce. So I flagged a gentleman in a green shirt named Antonio which we assume was the manager as the waiters wore black shirts. He agreed it wasn't enchilada sauce no apology was given to us from him for that.  After over 20 minutes of waiting another waiter brought her a new plate but forgot the side of sour cream she ordered. So he quickly brought a side of sour cream over but was served to us with a knat from the kitchen. I quickly asked for Antonio and showed him the knat in our sour cream. We pointed out to him they were flying along the windows. He didn't apologize at all or at least comp her meal. We were very disappointed the way he handled the situation. Needless to say we will not be eating her no longer. You guys need to work on your customer service!!",

Loved the tortillas that came with my dish though - they were big, not the usual small ones. You only get 2 though, but since they're burrito-sized, that is ok. By the way, the free chips come with a nice salsa and bean dip - both were quite tasty. Seems like a fun place for a party or drinks - quite loud, and people seemed to be having a good time.",

They get cold so quickly.   I'd heard great things about this restaurant, but it is a disappointment.  The chips are thick and over-fried and the salsa is weird, not fresh. Skip the shrimp cocktail--the shrimp are swimming in cold juice, like a gazpacho, but not as good.  The Cadillac margaritas are tasty, but how hard it is to make a good margarita in this town?   The guacamole is bland.  I had to add hot sauce and squeeze lemon juice on it.  Chili's has better steak fajitas at a fraction of the cost.",

We sat at the bar which has a beautiful view of our city especially around sunset. My husband & I are accustomed to any bar that you sit at in our town & you gamble (BTW-there is a sign posted on their machines that those seats are for those who are gambling) your drinks are free, so this was our expectation...  However none of our drinks were comped.  We ordered food & my Ensalada Suprema was far from supreme!  It consisted of huge hunks of iceberg lettuce, unseasoned chicken (very sparsely scattered), possibly some cheese, a slice of unripened tomato & a few small slices of avocado inside a taco salad shell. The cilantro dressing didn't even add to this untasteful & bland salad. I sent it back & ordered a couple of chicken tacos thinking it would be a safe choice & the were also a disappointment.  They had a hard, dry, bland fried chicken tender at the bottom of the shell with lettuce, cheese & no sauce of any kind & once again no flavor nor seasonings. Needless  to say our happy hour was not very happy!",

The food is always fresh and delish! The table side quacamole is expensive, but so worth it. I love that this place offers free bean dip with the salsa too!  The only complaint I have is that it is always so freakin loud in here. The place is very open with high ceiling and it makes for the worst place to have any sort of dinner conversation. Good thing I am married and am more into the food at this point, because this would be a horrible date place :p",

    "text": "Went for dinner with friends and had a great time. It's definitely a fun environment. The food is good, I won't say great but for a fun night out close to home it was great. I did go again last night with family and had really poor customer service from the host staff. Being that it was a Sat. Night, and I new from previous experiences that it was a loud busy place, I made a reservation a day in advance. I made sure to request a quiet nice table. Now, I'm fully aware that i can just request a nice table, not reserve one, but upon arrival I let the hostess know we would be happy to wait past our reservation time for a nice table (it was a special occasion). The woman working said no problem and it would just be a few min. When we were sat at our table it was right in the middle of 2 birthday party tables, and a small table had been pushed up to ours and stuck out in the isle to accommodate our guest. (We were only a party of 5) it was extremely loud and uncomfortable because 1 of our guest was sitting in the middle of the isle not facing any of the rest of us. We couldn't even hear ourselves talk. I politely asked another hostess as she passed by a few min. After we were seated if we could be moved and she said it would be a very long wait. So we unhappily stayed at our table. My fiance decided to take one of our guest down to the other side of the restaurant to show them the view we were hoping for and there were 3 empty tables where we would like to be. A manager passed by and I asked again and he said \"no problem, right this way\". He was very nice and moved us and also brought all of our drinks down for us as well. Overall I just was dissatisfied with the attitude and the way the hostess handled the situation. We were happy to wait longer for a nicer table but instead they sat us early, before our reservation time at one of the worst tables in the place. It really did start the night off in a very uncomfortable way.",

Service is great!  They have lots of servers and people refilling waters and removing plates, etc...  Went on a Friday night and there was a full on mariachi band playing. So, if you are looking for a quiet meal... it's not going to be here. This place is fun and loud. Their menu offers LOTS of options.... Chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc... I always have a hard time deciding what I want. And I usually take home half of what I order because their portions are large and after the chips, salsa and bean dip, I'm mostly full when dinner arrives. All entrees are served with rice and beans. And if you get something that comes with flour or corn tortillas... oh man... hard to choose.  Their corn tortillas are not the usual dry corn tortillas.  Their corn tortillas are AWESOME.  But then so are their flour tortillas.  But because I don't get to enjoy corn tortillas like theirs... I usually get the corn.  I highly recommend the corn tortillas... Get Them and Taste the difference.  All corn tortillas should be like this.  :)",

I ordered the fajitas last visit and this time I tried the enchiladas, fajitas had no flavor and the enchiladas tasted like the microwave variety. Sorry to see this place go downhill. Hope they fix the problems. Also it's extremely noisy with the band playing. I figured the band was on the weekend but it seems every night. Maybe if they got rid of the band and concentrated back on the food I would go back! No offense nobody wants trumpets blowing off in their ears when you are trying to eat!",

    "text": "Meh.  It was okay.  As everyone agrees, the view is fantastic.  Do yourself a favor, go to the parking lot, check out the view, then drive to another Mexican restaurant.  We were seated right away.  Awesome.  It was a Monday night, but still wildly crowded with no parking, so I was impressed to be seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  It was crazy loud.  Couldn't hear what anyone was saying right next to you.  I always order water first and this water tasted pretty bad for tap water.  No filter for sure.  The chips were good but the bean dip and salsa were really bland.  Our food was okay, nothing particularly flavorful or special.  All the entrees were around $18+, which to me pretty pricey for Mexican food.  (especially bland, uneventful food).  My margarita was pretty tasty.  Best part of the meal, for sure.  Then the waiter refused to acknowledge our table.  He was busy, so he willfully did not make eye contact with us, despite the fact we were ready for the check for a very long time.  He did check on his other tables, bus tables, seat guests, take orders and bring others their bill.  Except for once right after our meals were served, he never came back to check on us.  So, to sum it up..... View is great, Margaritas are good, Food is meh, Service is lacking.  If this was a Monday night, i don't want to imagine what a Saturday is. I do not understand why the parking lot is always packed.",

Unlike most \"mexican\" joints in town, Lindo Michoacan offers a wide range of authentic meals, not just the typical meat and beans drowned in rubbery cheese and bland sauce.  They allow the flavors of the ingredients to be the feature of the meal.  Plus, it's very vegetarian friendly!  Table-side guacamole preparation is a treat for some (although if you often make your guacamole at home it's not as enchanting as it is for some patrons), and an attentive and friendly wait staff avoid being overbearing.

Authentic, flavorful, fresh, original and served by an extremely attentive wait staff. My daughter and her fiance never miss an opprotunity to eat here when in town they live in California (where I am from) and thought all the best mexican food could be found... but I was wrong it took me 3 1/2 years to find this place and I will always be a loyal patron, if only for the table side guacamole, (yes I know this isnt impressive) but it is always flawless...the Pork Chili Verde has so much flavor like it has been cooked with love for hours.  I have had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here it never disappoints, it can be very busy on Holidays and weekends but it is worth the wait and the view did I mention the view? It is worth seeing especiall at sunset or after dark. Try it you will like it if you enjoy authentic deep rich flavors and quality fare you will become addicted to this place.",

I have a severe shellfish allergy and she likes to stress it to the server multiple times because another Mexican restaurant messed one once and I had to be rushed to the hospital. Antonio made it a point when he delivered the food to ensure us that he spoke with the kitchen and my food was safe. We liked him so much that when we came back a couple of weeks later we asked for Antonio. He knew who we were right away and told us before we even ordered that he made a note of my allergy and asked us if we wanted to order a shot of cazadores (like we ordered on our previous visit). Again, phenomenal service. The weekend after I proposed to my fiance our family came with us to Lindo to celebrate and we asked for Antonio. When he found out we got engaged he sent us 2 shots of cazadores and brought us a cheesecake to celebrate. He is truly a genuine individual who we now love to come see.

    "text": "First time at this restaurant and I couldn''t believe how big this place is... The parking lot was packed and cars were parking on the street.... I thought it was going to be a long wait but to my surprise we were seated right away. The frozen margarita was perfect like my favorite restaurant in Cozumel except I wasn't looking at the sea but the beautiful Las Vegas strip. The guacamole was made tableside and the waiter Angel made it 1/2 spicy to please our friends and 1/2 not for us. It was delicious. Our meals were also good. A lot of food so next time I will order a smaller portion. It has a party atmosphere and is not the place for a quiet dinner. This may just be our new Mexican restaurant!",

The shrimp sometimes taste like it was frozen for to long and they in froze it to quickly it has that bitter taste to it. The cool thing about it is when you tell the manager what's going on they take it off the bill. The carne is really good and so are the carnitas. The service is sometimes good but sometimes not. The vie whoever is incredible for a nice romantic dinner. I give them restaurant 3 stars",

It actually felt nice going somewhere more mellow on a weekend night where you can indulge in good food, drinks and conversation. I ordered the burrito \"El Burro Bionico\" which turned out to be the size of an infant. For $11.95 I could have easily shared it with my boyfriend and both been stuffed. I also ordered one of their speciality margaritas with dinner which also turned out to be a hit. The service was attentive and to the point. As our dinner was winding down our waiter let us know about their happy hour that starts at 11pm. We decided to move over to the bar and get a blue margarita. The bartender was friendly and made good drinks. We stayed until about 1am just enjoying some drinks, conversation and amazing view. I will definitely be returning.",

To finish the celebration our server and staff all sang a birthday song, gave my wife a tequila shooter, fresh churro's and made her wear a sombrero. Fun, festive, and did I say, amazing food!",

    "text": "Three of us had dinner here Friday July 11, 2014.  We had a reservation and after having read several reviews mentioning the great view we asked for a table with the view.  It was spectacular.  We were seated immediately and chips, salsa and bean dip arrived immediately.  All were good.  I prefer a lighter a chip - but these were fine.  I prefer a less hot salsa but this was fine.  Truthfully, I love all chips and salsa so it's not possible to disappoint me here.  Normally I order a cheese dip / queso but didn't get around to it this time so I can't give an opinion.  We requested the quacamole be made table side as I had seen mentioned on other Yelp reviews.  It was delicious.  I would never not order it at this restaurant.  One comment I'll make is I've had other tableside guac before and they have fresh garlic which I really love.  I would love it if Lindo Michoacan added garlic as an option with their guac.  But again, it was awesome as served.  I had cheese chile rellenos with rice and beans and my companions shared a pork carnitos dish.  We were all pleased.  I had two margaritas with Grand Marnier.  While pricey they were excellent.  Their service is excellent and attentive.  There was no delay in any part of the dinner.  I noticed tables being seated, served and cleared with speed.  As for the comments about the noise - we had no problem carrying on our conversations.  Granted, we were seated behind the band.  It seems as though the band plays a couple of songs and breaks so it's not a constant thing.  I think they handle the balance of the sound of the large open room, with sporadic band playing and enjoying dinner and conversation very well.",

I had the camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp) nothin spicy about them in fact they where sweet, sucks cause thats my favorite dish but I can get a way better plate of this in North LV for half the price also almost 20 bucks for a shrimp cocktail with octupus, shoot I can pay 9 bucks at the robertos on green valley and horizon ridge for the same amount and taste way better. I'm sorry but I really wanted to like this place but the food just isn't that great put some flavor on it and give me a salsa with some kick to it I feel sorry for the people that think this is good mexican food cause they never experienced the real deal not to mention getting ripped off with these prices....",

However the lobster tasted too fishy and the manager came over and we explained. He proceeded to argue that he hasn't had a complaint before. I told him we know what lobster is supposed to taste like. We've had lobster at Del Frisco's and Benihana's it never tasted like that! He took it off our bill though. Won't dine there again, food is not authentic or tasty. Do not recommend it. Also the horchata was too sweet and the waiter failed to tell me that the chicken mole enchilada where actually cheese enchiladas with a dry large chicken breast on top. The chips tasted burnt and the salsa was too spicy to enjoy. The music too loud. The only reason why I rated it three stars is because the waiters were friendly. And the plate taken off the bill.",

The salsa and chips they serve you are prompt and authentico, mmm,  Margaritas, delicious and they dont skimp out on the alcohol! I recommend the table side made guacamole. There is nothing better than frech guac, and I am in looove.   My friends and I usually share plates because their portions are so huge. I have had the burrito bionico and a few other stuff that I dont recall, probably because I didnt order it..   All in all, great & authentic Mexican food that is full of flavor and size. Great staff.

A bit of shredded beef also somehow made its way into the enchilada, luckily I caught it before it went onto my fork. Overall I was let down by the taste. I've definitely had better. The Margarita was super good though. So next time I'll just order some guac & chips, and sip on the Margaritas.

The feel of the place when you walk in is super authentic and welcoming, and the staff was some of the most attentive and polite service I've had at any restaurant in Vegas.  The House Margarita was delicious and a pretty decent size for the price ($8). The complimentary chips, dip & salsa are very good as well, the salsa has a good kick to it. The combo specialty plates are HUGE. More than enough for one person. Each plate comes with rice & beans plus fideo soup to start the meal. The soup was very flavorful and one of the highlights of the meal. I ordered the chicken enchilada, chicken taco & chicken tostada plate (Combo #6) and only ate half of everything. The person I was with ordered the beef enchiladas (both plates came with rice and beans, so a LOT of food) and he loved his meal as well.   One thing that should be noted is how AMAZING the view is overlooking The Strip. Definitely a major bonus for dining at this location. Everything was reasonably priced, the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic, and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "There are two big reasons why I love Lindo's: the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the house made guacamole!  Every time we come here we are welcomed by friendly staff. You can look in to the kitchen where they're busy making the homemade tortillas, and your mouth is watering even before you've been seated.   The place is usually pretty busy, and when we've been visiting it's always very loud. I like it, it makes for a great atmosphere.   As I mentioned, the house made guacamole is my favorite. They make it fresh right by the table, and you get to pick how spicy you want it. Usually they also give you a complimentary tomato soup in addition to the fresh chips and salsa, so by the time you're ready for the entrees you're already pretty full.   The Margaritas are also very good, so Lindo's is a good place for a date night with perfect views accompanied by delicious Mexican food and a mariachi band.",

We were seated immediately and promptly brought chips/salsa/beans and water. The service was very fast and excellent. My daughter spilled her drink all over the table and the staff swept in and had it completely cleaned up in about a minute. Our food came out quickly and everything was delicious! I can't spell anything that we ordered, but we have eaten here numerous times and have never been disappointed by the food. Our favorites are the fideo soup and sopapillas (the two things on the menu I can properly pronounce lol). We also got a seat by the window so we could enjoy the lovely view of our city. We will most definitely be back. :)",

We've eaten here countless times & always had a great experience, service & food...but tonite was horrible..his chicken dish was bland & my shrimp taco was salty plus the normal cream sauce wasn't even on it.  I know there were just a couple of tables open & we sat at the bar, but it closes at 2am people!!!  The bartender was too busy tallying up her shift & finally asked us if we were ready to order...then after our food came it had to take me looking at this guy to tell her to come check on us!!! We had recommended this place to so many of our out of town guests...well forget it now...I don't know if they've changed the crew or what but it sucks Should've ate at GVR!",

They also offer margaritas and beers for $3-4. With a spectacular view of the Vegas strip and a freshly made margarita for $3.50, you'll be extremely happy with this happy hour. Much better late night Mexican fix than some sketchy take out...  Chips, salsa, and bean dip are complimentary.",

I ordered the chicken tostada shell and although there was a lot of chicken, it had zero flavor and was really dry.  My husband had the huevos ranchos (I will give them one star for that meal), my Mom ordered the nachos, which were okay, Dad ordered the Botana 'Papa Chencho' (an appetizer) that looked great, but again...the food had no flavor-as in, NO seasoning at all and the meat (chicken and beef) both were really dry.    I would guess anyone could swing a dead cat and hit a better Mexican restaurant than this place. Seriously though, with all the awards and five star reviews, this place is a huge disappointment and WAY overpriced.  The second star is for the excellent wait staff.  I feel bad that their tips may suffer for the awful food.  On a side note, the restaurant wasn't very clean.  Needless to say, I will not be returning.",

My friend lives in Salt Lake where good Mexican food is non-existent, so when she asked for some Mexican cuisine, I took her here.  The guacamole was unbelievably good!  It's prepared tableside and it had a nice amount of cilantro and jalapenos.  I had so much guac that I could not even touch the amazing chicken dish our server suggested I get.  It went home with my friend.  Service was great and the view is out of this world! You can see across all of Las Vegas.  Portions are huge.  You've been warned!",

Other than that the food is lame, the service is terrible, and the price is exorbitant.  Well,  the real estate justified the prices. So in a way we agreed on to pay top dollar for what ever we ate there. The chips and salsa were good. My order was all screwed up.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail that my server forgot about it. My fried fish wasn't cooked with the right sauce.  So my server apologized and decided to send it back to the kitchen. In retrospect I. Wish he would have been allowed me to participate in suchlike decision.  But not.  He just took the fish back. The kitchen slapped the fish with the aforementioned sauce and refried the same fish one more time. The ensuing outcome was logical: my fish was with crust harder than a rock. Now you could say: everyone can make a two mistakes in one order. But the table right behind send their order back because meat wasn't properly cooked. One more gripe.  The server  and busboy insisted on calling me Amigo.  Amigo is a term of endearment.  So I wanted to lecture them on the proper etiquette. I just left the cafeteria bland taste food with fantastic views behind with a Texas-size disappointment.",

Last time we went our server delivered our food then we never saw him again when we walked out he was sitting down I guess on a break. Tonight we went out for an early Valentines dinner. The server must of went on break.  I think it is rude. At least inform your guest that you are going on a break and so and so will take care of you... we were sitting there looking for our waiter then asking other employees and management for napkins boxes and even our bill.

The drink waiter came by and refilled my cup and brought us out another bowl of chips because we had wiped those out fast also. The chip/drink waiter (Fernando) was on point with his refills. He was awesome. We ordered our food and shortly after we got our soup. That little bowl of soup is so good. It wasn't long after we had finished our soup that our food came out. I ordered the chili Colorado. The meat was so tender and the meal was so delicious. It's definitely my go to meal when I don't know what to get. My wife got the enslada marinera. It was very good.

Chips, salsa and bean dip to start. Order the fresh made guacamole- they make it for you right at the table and it's AMAZING. Ask for all the toppings- they make it a little tiny, tiny bit spicy but it's not even noticeable. If you want no spice, just ask!  The a la carte items in the back are half the price, same full size portions just minus the rice beans and soup. The portions here are so big you won't finish it anyways, no need for all of the extras! The combo plates are a nice mix and if you're feeling like having leftovers for the next two meals, go for it.  Parking is tight so they'll always be people parking up and down Carnegie. They do some pretty fun stuff if it's your birthday so celebrate the Mexican restaurant way! ALCOHOL!",

My teenager ordered a steak quesadilla but did not like it at all. He only ate one piece. I ordered a side bean taco and an enchilada   I did not like the enchilada at all, but my teen was starving so he ate it, said it was ok. My taco was just beans and tomato, no cheese or lettuce so it was pretty bland. Husband got chiliquillas. He wasn't a fan but he's picky with chiliquillas.   We would not go back for the food but we would totally go back for drinks and guacamole if Erick was our server! We did not complain about the food.",

I honestly think people are just fooled by this place because of its location . I've come several times to be fair and gave it another chance .. NEVER AGAIN  for the prices they charge . no way! I'll go to Del taco before I go back there again! I will also mention server push the bar  way to much..  way to quick on asking if you'd like another drink.. but you'll wait for refills on your ice tea or water..",

If not just for the good food (and I'm not into spicy even though I still love Mexican) the fact that they cater to my level of spicy or lack there of is awesome! The atmosphere has been great every time (I've been here 3 times). I'm a Henderson local and they have a great view of the city, live music a great welcoming staff especially the waiters and even the bus boys are super pleasant. But it's a great place to watch the sunset and have some great drinks as well within a reasonable price range. Enjoy it, I did and will continue to.",

    "text": "When you are feeling home sick and was craving authentic Mexican food. Im originally from Cali and tried one other place, and it was not close to what we used to be able to eat. After looking up places nearby, we came across this gem. You cannot miss this spot as it is located in Anthem/Henderson, and it is bright orange on the outside.   Before getting to the inside, this is by far one of the best locations for a restaurant. Whether you are coming to lunch to meet up with friends or going on a date with that special someone, the views of the strip are breath taking from the parking lot. Now if you come during dinner time, you can catch the sunset or even enjoy the beatiful lights that fill the skies that vegas is known for.   The service: we arrived a little after 6pm and the place was packed. Luckily, as soon as we got inside, we were seated right away. While looking through the menu, a gentlemen dropped by our table and gave us complimentary  salsa, chips, and beans. Not long after did we place our orders. I ordered the taco de pescado with rice, beans, and soup. My fiance ordered the carne asada torta after looking through their extensive menu. Prices are around $10 to 30, but well worth it.   How everything tasted: ohhh my, the tacos de pescado was fresh and by far the most tender for being grilled. I also loved how the 3 were fully loaded accompanied by ginormous avocado and lemon. They are by for the most generous. It also came with a spicy chipotle style sauce, instead of the original tartar. If you do not like it, fish platter also came with pico de gallo. On the other hand, the carne asada torta, was also ginormous. Big enough that my fiance could not even finish the entire thing! That was a first. All in all, we left with happy tummys.   We were offered dessert, but had to pass. Definitely will have to come back next time to try the dessert.",

We come from California where so far nowhere in Las Vegas has that special touch. I ordered Camaromes a La Diabla & i swear not even spicy one bit , they were more sweet than anything and thats why I rate this place a 3. My boyfriend had a pork chop with salsa and it was okay but not the best . The place is indeed very nice , all the decorations  and detail & most of all the view its astonishing,  just the food was a big dissapointment for the both of us .

Something to see and provides a topic for conversation while enjoying your dinner.  The view is much more stunning at dusk!  If you can wait, you may want to arrive a little later in the evening   There is quite a large selection of menu items to choose from for dinner.  I've never seen the lunch menu.  I must include that I order the guacamole every time.  It's delicious!  It's also fun to watch the server actually make it table side.  If you pay attention, you can take the recipe at home with you and make it on your own!    The food here is great, although I would give it a 8.5 out of 10.  I'll admit I typically eat chicken or fish tacos, so my rating is limited to just a few items.  I've had one of the fish plates and will say that it was very good, but could be better.  Finally, the dining area is a little loud but comfortable.  I obviously like this place and would recommend it to others.",

Through the long window behind the bar you can see way out last the strip. This is a sit down restaurant and is a breath of fresh air from all the take out Mexican food we've seen.   The menu was very expansive and had a little bit of something for everyone. Very impressed with the wait staff and how attentive they were.  The chips were crispy and fluffy yet solid for scooping beans and salsa. The salsa was also good, nice flavor and definitely not bland. We ended getting 2 bowls of chips (famous last words)  I chose the chicken mole enchiladas. They were so savory and cheesy and the mole sauce was excellent. I thought they put a little chocolate in them (it is common but every mole is different) I was so full i couldn't finish my plate.  My husband got floutas and some sopes on the side. Both were delicious and cooked perfectly. Their meat and cheese was cooked perfectly and he finished the entire plate. The side of sopes came recommended by our server. We got 2 beef, 2 chicken, and one chorizo.   Each dish comes with a soup called fideo. My husband hasn't had fideo (fi-THEY-o) since he was a little boy and I thought he was going to cry when they put a bowl in front of him.  We ended our meal with a few shots of Don Julio (a suggestion from the waiter) and they definitely helped the food go down easily.   We will be back when my in laws are in town, I have. A-feeling they will enjoy this place.",

After casino hopping in the strip my cravings for mexican dishes is so intense.  Big restaurant on a hilly part of Henderson,parking is free and in it there is a view deck where you can enjoy the beauty of scenery and the lights from the strip. Mexican inspired decors,im loving everything,from the big wooden door,its like aztec temple.  All servers and receptionist are wearing traditional mexican clothes and they are looking fantastic. Small flatform can be found in the middle of the restaurant,live music is ongoing,mexican songs.  we seated  near a huge glass panel window,view is amazing what a night. Waiter service,excellent service,another place where you can find bilingual crew.our server bytheway is young handsome mexican guy that adds 1 star on my review.  Takes reservation,wifi free and they have big TV screens that plays sports when we came.noise level is morethan average...lots of patrons and there were few b days going on. Full bar,no outside seating,good for all ages,group,family and kids.Accept cash/card/debit.  Foodwise, all the dishes we ordered were all very good we had the carne asada \"don Francesco\"juice tender flank steak grilled with monterey jack cheese enchalada,we had the playa azul a white fish fillet sauted in a delicious spanish sauce made with tomatoes,onions,jalopenos,topped with cheese,i also got the taco a beef taco 1 piece very very good it comes with a holder so your taco will be serve standing on a plate what a brilliant idea.  Aside from from this we had the fresh salsa,freshly made beside your table so fresh so so good. Serving is generous its actually huge,excellent quality and taste is really superb. This is one of so many restaurants that i would visit again and again. i recommend to all locals and tourist like me to visit this place and discover for yourself what a good mexican restaurant is.....",

I also had their fast food version at the LV convention center and it was much more affordable and delicious for a quick lunch.  Parking was tough....dont go during the weekend. Wait can be an hr easy and there is no waiting areas making it more difficult to wait. The bar is inside and small and cant really grab a drink and stand around bc thr bar sits low. Awkward.  If you come for your bday they put on a sombrero and sing for you and THEN they give you a shot (or 2). They literally feed you the shot which is funny.  I had the whole fish....red snapper. And it was good. Didnt understand why it came with fries though.",

The staff was very accommodating to our party of 30, giving us a side room with an exquisite night view of the valley.  Several servers waited on us hand and foot, keeping drinks topped off and the salsa and chips full.  The restaurant was very busy, with a pleasant noisiness that complemented the fellow singing and playing the guitar.    For the appetizer, we had sopa de fideo, and fresh guacamole with a really nice kick... good, clean, fresh jalapeno spice on this one (perfect for El Gigante Picante Del Monte!)  For the main course, I enjoyed a New York strip, cooked rare... just how I like it.  Thick and juicy, with nice Mexican sides of rice and freshly prepared beans.  Washed it all down with a cold Pacifico, and I was doing great.  My bride enjoyed the chicken enchiladas, and I stole a bite-- very fresh and flavorful.  Everything seems to be prepared in the restaurant, not bought in a big can and warmed up in the back.  Parking on a busy night is a tough proposition in the parking lot-- best bet is to find a street spot and walk in.  Speaking of walking in, I would recommend making a reservation, as the place was packed, even when we left.  If you find yourself in Hendo or just want to take a bit of a drive away from the strip on your next Vegas adventure, this spot is worth a try.",

    "text": "Been coming here for almost 10 years now! It's my families favorite Mexican food in the Las Vegas area.   The restaurant is very large inside and has some seating that overlooks the strip. It's decorated in Mexican decor and they even have live entertainment sometimes.   It's hilarious when they come to the table for a birthday. They kinda sneak up on the birthday person and throw a sombrero on their head and sing to them with a lit candle inside a churro and a shot of tequila if it's an adult.    The chips, salsa and beans are tasty and always something to look forward to. The enchilada sauce can be somewhat bland sometimes but everything else on the menu is pretty good. The tortillas are homemade and they bring fideo soup when an entree is ordered but they always bring it for kids. Chile relleno is amazing and so are the vegetation tacos. There are so many options on the menu that it never gets old. There are terrific lunch specials on weekdays until 5. Love this place!",

We got here at around 11:30am to beat the lunch rush and glad we did. Figured it would be a hot spot for Father's Day. By 12:15pm and almost done with our lunch, the place was packed. We could barely hear ourselves think. Good for them!   The staff was really nice and attentive. Something that I appreciate. Where it missed the mark was the food. I have never left here or any other Lindo location raving about the meal, so I knew what I was getting walking into the door. I wanted my Mom to try it out to see if I were just being too picky in comparison to my other favorite Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were amazing and the highlight of the meal. I got the veggie burritos and Mom got the chicken chimichanga. While both were pretty good, we had both had better elsewhere.  At the end of the day, if you are looking for True, authentic Mexican food, I don't think this place will do it for you. At least it doesn't do it for me. I like the True, authentic feel other Mexican restaurants have given me with a more intimate setting. This place is built to accommodate the masses, which leads me to believe that something is bound to be off if there's a full house.",

Two weeks later someone in New York is trying to use a perfect replica of the card to make purchases at gas stations and food.  Our credit card company caught if quickly as we have zero connections to New York.  Beware. They hired a roach of a person.  The nachos are not worth it!

We arrived about 6:15p and was told the wait was about 15 min. 30 min later we were seated.   The service was not good. My table had ordered their drinks, but I couldn't remember the name of what I wanted and had to wait for the server to get me a cocktail menu. 15 min after I finally ordered my drink, I had to ask the server where it was.   The food has slowly gotten worse while the prices continue to rise. My favorite dish has always been the Camarones Sarandeados. It's my \"go to\" meal there. They used to serve 5-6 large shrimp but now you get 7-8 much smaller shrimp for $3 more. The sauce is very oily now and it lacks the flavor it used to.   Everyone who lives in the Henderson area knows that this restaurant is very popular with very limited parking and long waits. It would be nice if they would accept reservations. Over all, I hope the service and food improves or my family will need to find another Mexican restaurant to frequent.",

However, all of their refried beans, including the bean dip served with the chips, are made with lard.  Their rice uses chicken broth.  This is fine if you think to ask.  Unfortunately, you might think ordering off of their vegetarian menu safeguards you.  It does not.  The vegetarian items are served with larded beans and chicken broth rice.

The first time was at lunch and I had a taco and an enchilada that tasted like the sauce was out of a can and uncooked. The second time for dinner was better. I had a skirt steak, which was good, but nothing I'd rave over. I miss El Jeffe's (creativity and flavor).  On the upside, the view is incredible. The service was alright and yes, the restaurant is loud, but you have to blame that on the previous owners that built the horrible Italian restaurant that was there.",

We  made a reservation and Sat for damn near an hour! Seeing how it was a Friday night. We finally get to a table and waited and waited and waited some more, 45 minutes to be exact, Our waiter finally shows up, takes  our drink order and we wait another 15 minutes for that to come. IT  takes Another 45 to put in our food order. I asked  my waiter several times what was taking so long, he couldn't tell me a thing. I  happen to  look over to the bar area , it was a huge wedding party that all the wait staff was catering  to. 2 hours later our food came, half raw ,thrown on a plate and on top of that my son who is five fell asleep at the table and left hungry, we were charged full price for our meal when it should have been comped, they still charged us! Lindo you shit the bed in the worst way, your customers should come first, I and the other 250 people sitting there that night feel the same way, Put off ,highly Pissed and never coming back!",

The view of the strip is nice if you can get one of those tables but the food is just bad.  Tried something new (again) tonight to see if I'm picking the wrong things and it's just the food and the cooking (tonight tried vegetarian fajitas and it was all green peppers, unbelievable that there were no other veggies but a few onions).  3 of us went to dinner and they forgot our soup and we sat there getting ignored when we needed a bill so we could leave the place.

    "text": "Yesterday was the second time I have tried this restaurant (04-15-2012). The first time the food was ok, but the service was great. And the view of the valley is amazing! This time was anything but good! The food was again, just ok. But we were just going out for nachos, so it is hard to mess those up. We sat at the bar. They had 3 bartenders on, not a one of which had a clue what to do. It took forever to get our drinks, and we were never once checked on when we got our food. When we sat for 20 minutes with empty plates and empty drinks in front of us it was obvious we were not going to be offered anything else so once we finally got one of the bartenders attention and asked for our check we were told just a minute. Five minutes later we still had no check and she was just walking around behind the bar putting glasses up. We then asked another bartender for our check. Again nothing. By now it has been almost 40 minutes trying to get a check. I am still unclear as to the problem since there was only 2 other couples at the bar during this whole time, and the restaurant was not very busy either. So 3 bartenders would have been over kill in any other restaurant in town. But not a single one of them seemed to have any idea what they were supposed to be doing so I guess they needed all 3 idiots. We finally went to the hostess stand to ask someone to get our check. When asked how our dinner was I smiled and let them know the view is amazing, the food was ok, but the service was so bad that I would never be back, and to keep in mind I have a very big mouth and will probably be telling everyone I come across about what a bad experience this was. I am a local bartender as well. I come across quite a few guests in that  general area. I would think with so many choices for mexican food in this town and so many restaurants struggling to stay open in these tough times they would be able to find someone that actually wants to make sure the guest is happy. I guess the fact that their food is just ok, and they don't seem to have to strive for better there why bother with the service? The name on our check was Adriana. I have no idea which of the 3 she was, but it really doesn't matter. All three were equally as bad with their skills, or actually lack their of!  Save your time and money and go someplace that actually appreciates your business. This place obviously does not!",

    "text": "Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had, but far from the best.  I've eaten at this particular location several times, and the best food I've eaten has been no better than mediocre.  The chile verde sauce tastes too much like tomatillo and too little like chile verde. The enchiladas seem more like an overcooked casserole than flavorful, stuffed tortillas. The chile relleno may be their best \"traditional\" Mexican dish though it is very bland. Finally, on the food side, the tacos--at least those served at lunch--lack tomato and onion. They're stuffed with meat, lettuce, a smattering of tasteless orange cheese--and that's it: no tomato, no onion. I can get a more satisfying and better filled taco at a fast-food joint for less money,  Now, as to their \"famous Margeritas.\" The only reason these could be famous is for the poor quality at the astounding price: a base-price blended Margarita, which looks and tastes like little more than a lime slushy costs $8.00. Coyote Cantina on Sunset serves much better Margaritas for the same or less money, especially for the lunch special.  I give this place two stars mainly for the spectacular view., The Margaritas merit no stars, the food one star, and, maytbe, the service two stars, if the people would smile more often, though perhaps they've tasted the food",

I've dined at the one on Desert Inn and I think the one off Sunset is the same owners, but for some reason I am not a huge fan of Lindo Michoacon. The food just doesn't do it for me, and I try to keep an open mind. I guess it's just a different style or recipe? Where is the zip, and gusto? No taste of onions, cilantro, salsa is nearly non existant. I had a chicken chimicanga and the chicken inside was all red and diced up. No other flavors or fillers, kind of bland and no zip. Why? Porque????  Even the chips and salsa wasn't right to me. The red dipping sauce is just plain, the chips are different and the beans are a nice touch, but it had a off taste to it and I LOVE Mexican beans. We had regular margaritas on the rocks, but even that was just average. Put a good amount of salt on the rim, shake the ingredients to a froth! The sour mix was almost grocery store quality. The margarita is the flagship drink, why not make it with some flare?! To me I go for the nice view of the city that is offered in a surprising location in Henderson. The service is very good and that is a plus too. I like it, but the food isnt' my style.",

It is slightly elevated on a hill in Henderson, lending it to spectacular, panoramic,  views.

Luckily we made reservations as it was packed full at 5:30. We were given a prime table on the windows behind the bar with that incredible view of the valley and strip below. Our server Martin provided outstanding service to us even though every table was full.   Of course we started with margaritas and their fantastic guacamole which is made table side. 3 people ordered the Camarones abuelito timo which are large shrimp with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon and then fried. Hard to go wrong with that! They were great. Others had fajitas, enchiladas and the pescado Vallarta which is fish cooked in olive oil, wine, peppers, garlic and onions. She said it was \"fabulous\". Of course we ended with flan and fried ice cream.   I took some pictures but by then the Patron margaritas had kicked in and they didn't come out to well :)  It may not be the most authentic mexican food in town, but I think Lindo does a great job and with a perfect location up on Horizon Ridge. If you haven't been in a while, give them another try.",

He was great at customer service. The whole team was. If we were out of chips or water another waiter or bidder would come refill us. My boyfriend got tacos and he said they were great. I could tell because he ate it quick. He said only thing he had an issue with was the fact the taco shell was really hard. I had the chimichanga. I always get it and it always tastes the same. So delicious melts in your mouth. It's always a great experience at Lindo. I suggest you go at night so you can see the strip.",

They had multiple people walking around filling our drinks and asking if we needed anything. The food was also pretty great! We ordered the carne Asada and shrimp tacos they were filled with a lot of meat. Our daughter ate the pollito (fried chicken and fries) from the kids menu and surprisingly she ate it all! She's pretty picky when it comes to food so this was a pleasant surprise. My husband and I also ordered a michealada which was also delicious. Overall, we will definitely be coming back!",

The food was great the the view over the strip is amazing and the restaurant is loud so if your looking for that nice quiet dinner this isn't the place for you. They have live entertainment. I myself got the shrimp Enchiladas which were very good and my daughter for the breaded fried shrimp which came with a spicy sauce on the side (too spicy for kids) but the sauce was amazing! My advice would be to set a reservation and make it a little early. By the time we left around 7-730 there was a line out people waiting inside and outside (not a lot of waiting room inside).",

    "text": "Has anyone seen the South Park episode where Cartman goes to \"Casa Bonita?\" Well, this place is the same thing, just with no tall diving board or pool. That would be cool though.   Lindo Michoacan sits a top a hill that has a great view of the Las Vegas strip from Henderson. Seriously, fantastic view of the strip and even more awesome at night. I came here on a suggestion from a friend and decided to bring the entire family along. First off, this place is huge; tall ceilings, large dinning area, and a large bar with a window view. Lindo is also very loud with live music playing and giant bells ringing (reminding you there's a birthday happening with 50 feet), plus there are kids everywhere. Kids are usually a red flag for me to turn and run out, but I had about eight people with me so escape was not an option.  We sat down and immediately ordered table-side guacamole and margaritas. They have two versions; spicy and regular, we ordered two of each and we're amazed to watch two servers on each end of the tables churn out this green pile of goopy goodness. By the way, you automatically get chips, salsa, and bean dip at your table when you sit down. I lived in SoCal for quite awhile and was privy to a lot of guacamole and Lindo ranks at the top of my guac loving tastebuds. My favorite was the spicy version; great flavor, creamy with crunchy texture, and just enough spice. Highly recommended!   There were a lot of dishes going on at this table, but let's focus on me because...well just because. I ordered the Chili Verde Pork plate; it was both fantastic and huge! This plate is made up of pork that is slow cooked in a green chili sauce for hours until it pretty much melts in your mouth. The pork was super tender and also came with homemade flour tortillas.These were perfectly chewy and soft. I rarely can't finish my meal, but I was stuffed by the fourth bite. Yay, for midnight snacks!   The service here was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun. Great place for families and a possible low-key date night. I might be back for few a cocktails and sunset view of the Strip.",

The service was excellent - very attentive and friendly. The food was pretty amazing. I ordered the lengua tacos - and it was tender and flavorful. They give you fresh chips with beans and salsa too. My husband ordered the carne asada and it was really tender and had a great flavor. We also tried the nachos and that was good - very cheesy, the chicken that we added to it was juicy. We'll definitely check it out again to try other items on their menu (their menu is large - hundreds of options - even for vegetarians!).",

As soon as you sit down, they serve you warm, freshly made chips, warm bean dip, and salsa. As soon as the basket gets low (and it will because it's delicious), they refill it.   The menu is huge and has a lot of variety. They have a lot of unique dishes in addition to the standard dishes you find at most Mexican restaurants.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It came with guacamole and sour cream. The flour tortillas looked home made. The quesadilla was pretty good overall, but it was a bit on the bland side.   The restaurant is quite loud. They sing live music loudly, and people talk loudly. It is pretty hard to hear others at the table. We weren't even there when it was very busy, and I couldn't hear others at the table well.",

The morning after my ears are still ringing.  I liken it to Sitting on the tarmac when a 747 is taking off, or perhaps a Rock Concert where your right next to the speakers.  Get the picture? If you wanted to come here and enjoy a good meal and talk with friends....forget about it.  There's no way you can hear anything you're saying to each other.   Between the natural buzz of a restaurant of patrons, you have a noisy kitchen, someone that clangs a chime every few minutes, a live musician performing your greatest hits over top of of this and then the peace de resistance, Birthday mariachi singers that play literally every 5 minutes.

    "text": "I just can't get enough of Lindo's, also it's mom's favorite food & view.  The service is fantastic!  These wonderful people are like family to me, Manny, Gerardo, who make this restaurant, make the world go round in here even though they are always on the go.  That personal touch goes a long way and here years later we still love it every time.    Lovely nice to come w/ a colorful cloudy horizon which I had to post cause the view here is remarkable.  Bridget got the Mango Margarita, I got the Jalapeno Margarita, mom, the usual regular Margarita & dad a Pinot Noir.  I think I'll try the Mango w/ jalapeno next time lol.  Spicy and sweet.  Everyone loved their dish!  Mom got the grilled fish tacos, yum!  She could only finish two, after all the warm chips, bean dip & salsa.  So addicting!  I finished the third fish taco and may get that next time, but there's too many good menu items!    Dad got the dish I always get when I'm eating 'healthy' the Pollo Rebeka, which is served w/ pasilla strips & flour tortillas.  Totally yum!    Bridget also got what I love except w/ steak, I usually get it w/ chicken, but she loved it.  The Enchiladas de Mole are two cheese enchiladas w/ a side of either beef or chicken.  The sauce is a must-try!    I felt like the Toro de Coca Cola again!  A huge steak medium, smothered in a mole Coca Cola type of sauce.  Trust me under all that sauce is a huge piece of meat.  I wrap up slices in a flour tortilla w/ sour cream & whoa, talk about tasty amazing!  Similar feeling towards all of my favorite dishes though.  My second time this dish & it's definitely made for two!  Actually dad & I ended up taking half of our meals home cause the portions are so large and they also serve either a salad or fideo soup.   Tres Leches w/ coconut was how we finished the already filling & beautiful evening.  It was truly the cherry on top.  Mmm!  I highly recommend it!  Also I think that for the food lovers who don't like Lindo's they should order something outside of the box like one of the many dishes that I am addicted to!  I list them w/ pix.  It's not what you'd get at a regular Mexican restaurant & most dishes come w/ corn or flour tortillas, kind of like a fajita.  I haven't ever had fajitas here, my fav, cause I've fallen in love w/ so many other unique dishes.    Happy eating friends!",

We had reservations at 6 pm and we didn't end up getting seated til 6:35. The lady at the front desk was confused and she was a complete mess. We were not happy to say the least. When we got seated we were treated amazing and the service was extremely fast. The food was great and tasted fresh. The chili relleno was authentic, a bit spicy but very delicious. The cheese enchiladas were yummy as well. I would get the same thing again next time we come. Thank you  to Ari and the rest of our servers that made our experience very enjoyable.",

Our server greeted us and took our food and drink order and as soon as he dropped off our drinks we never saw him again. Never asked how our drinks tasted or our food, in fact he never came back again I had to get up and ask for a take out box and also for the check and the manager took my payment. Walking out we saw the server sitting down counting his money and probably doing his checkout. There for we maybe not ever come back to this location, it's sad to say specially that we recently just moved on that side of town.",

I waived him down to grab an appetizer while we waited for the rest of our party.  Then when my family finally arrived they advised us there was no room to fit 6, so we said thats fine you can move us. Well the waiter wouldn't even address the problem to us the hostess and the bus boy had to speak for him while he stood behind us with a distasteful look on his face.  When we were finally moved the new waiter was much nicer, Rene. He actually acknowledged we there.   Other than the waiter situation, food is amazing, atmosphere is great.

What a huge disappointment it was the other night when we took friends from out of town to dinner.  They wanted Mexican so naturally I thought of Lindo Michoacan in Henderson.  First of all, it took 27 minutes to get our food.  Secondly, the fajitas were cold. The skillet they brought the fajitas out on was not even warm. The beans and rice looked like they had been cooked the day before and the lettuce was wilted.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter and he offered to take it back.  He brought back another plate of beans and rice and they were just as cold.  I had to go find the manager to tell him what was going on.  He couldn't have cared less.  My husband had ordered a salad and it was awful...how do you screw up lettuce!  None of us ate our food.  Terrible dinner.  I won't go back nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.

Next we ordered the shrimp burrito appetizer... It was more of a chimichanga but so good regardless!!! I could have stopped there and been satisfied but I still had my steak fajita burrito on its way!!  My burrito was good but could have done with more seasoning. My aunt had a carne Asada burrito with was seasoned perfectly and my husband and cousin had the carne asada. Their steaks were delicious.  After 2 bites of burrito and sampling everyone else's I was stuffed! But the waiter came over and said if we voted for them for some contest we would get a free dessert or margarita.  I wanted to try their fried ice cream so I said why not!  Here is why I only gave 4 stars...I do what the waiter told me to do and he tells me oh you can only get churros and it can go for my husband's margarita because it wasn't the regular one. At no time did he say there were restrictions. He made it seem as if it was any dessert so they could get my vote. I still got the fried ice cream for $6 and it was so good!!!! The free churros were also good.",

Very good service and attention.  They place does get rather noisy during peak hours and especially when there is a birthday to celebrate and the entire staff comes to the table to sing.

I got the tamales my first time - and odd choice for me, because I rarely gravitate toward tamales - and they were very good, I'd highly recommend. Another time I got a burrito, and it was above average. The meat here is well cooked (not amazing, but reliable and tasty). The guac is made tableside and made from good ingredients.  Then of course, there is the view. Coming here for happy hour, sitting at the counter and having margaritas, is really the best part of coming here. Bartenders have always been friendly and the drinks are a good deal.  This place would be average at best in So Cal or even Nor Cal, but it's one of the best I've found in Vegas so far.",

I've tried the regular margaritas and they're pretty weak... Love the flavored ones as well but again weak. Great chips and salsa comes with a bean dip as well. As far as food I always order the green cheese enchiladas (#14) so yummy! One thing I don't like is that my fideo soup which comes with my food always gets to the table at the same time my dinner does. Big no no and honestly it's annoying. The last time I was there I had to remind the server about the soup after our meal was already brought to the table. Ugh... honestly I shouldn't have to do that. That's one reason for the 3 star instead of 5. Another big one is....I have noticed that the service there is not as good as it used to be back in the day at the desert inn location. Seems like the servers want you to order...eat and leave. They want to turn tables. I get it more money. As a customer's i do not want to get rushed or feel like I'm not wanted there. Please management change this. Customer service is everything!!!!!",

But you can't really get close to the view as it's behind the bar and there's no tables near the massive windows overlooking the Vegas valley. They don't comp drinks at the bar, even though they do have gaming. The food definitely left something to be desired. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't exactly good either. The service was friendly and mostly attentive. All in all, not a bad spot, but it wouldn't be my pick when craving Mexican-fare.",

It is pretty loud because there was a band playing and it was just crowded. We did get lucky though and sat in the area with a nice view, which was less noisy. I tried the jalapeno margarita. It was ok. It wasn't the best. If they used jalapeno-infused tequila and put some spicy salt on the rim, it would be heaven. Their table side guac is fresh and delish. We ordered a shrimp ranchero and shrimp with tequila sauce (or something like that). It wasn't that great. The fried ice cream was really good, though. We'll probably come back again and try something else.",

That said, I can appreciate new things,  but I agree that this is not the best Mexican food. Forget fresh veggies - there's a lot of brown on the plate.  I haven't eaten a real meal here, just went here for the bar food and drinks, which, by the way, has a KILLER view. This is a great place to come on holidays if you don't have a balcony (which I do) to see the Strip set off fireworks. You can check it out because they're open until 2.   The food prices at happy hour are good, the taste is fine and the chips and dip are good. The drinks are strong which, is why people order from bars, right? The staff is very friendly and the place always has a zillion cars around it.",

Good news for us is that they honored the reservation and sat us in the back room immediately. Our server and busboy did an excellent job considering the size of the group. I ordered the Camerones Purepecha, a shrimp casserole dish that came with rice and beans on the side. The shrimp dish was OK but not great. The rice and beans were typical chain Mexican restaurant fare. With good food and good service, the reason for only the 3 star rating is the ambiance. The noise level made it very hard to hear the person sitting across from you. About every 15 or 20 minutes, a mariachi band came by to play happy birthday to one of the nearby tables. The first 2 or 3 times it was cute. After that, it just added to the noise. I know some folks like that kind of vibe in a restaurant. But not for me. I won't be going back.",

I have tried many dishes here, but my absolute favorite are the grilled fish tacos. The guacamole is freshly made at your table so you can pretty much control how you want it to taste. The chorizo fundido or queso fundido is the best I've had (a lot of places will mix in fake tasting cheese, blegh). Cadillac margaritas are the way to go and definitely do their job of getting you tipsy. This is a perfect way to kick off your birthday celebrations. The views are amazing and so are the desserts. I also love their fideo soup (although I think I am the only one I know who eats it lol). I have been giving this place business for years now and I will continue to do so :)",

I'm not sure if there's new management or is going on, but unfortunately I need to be honest and downgrade my long standing 5star review to 1 Star. Last night's dinner (Fri 10/19/2018) was very disappointing. We've been to This Lindo countless times. Our past 2-3x have not been very good at all.   The \"Erica\" that I always get when I come to Lindo tasted and looked completely different from all the other times I've ordered it. Sauce has changed and chicken was dry. It wasn't just the downgrade in food quality, the service was extremely slow and I feel like there's no more attention to detail. Finished plates sitting on table for 15+min with no server in sight, no drink refills.  To top everything off...after we were sat, I got up to use the restroom and notify the manager that we were celebrating a birthday for my wife. He told me they would do a birthday presentation no problem. We finished our meal and sat there for a good 15min before getting a check dropped off and no birthday presentation. At that point it was no longer a surprise since I needed to get up and track down another manager and make a 2nd request.  Can't recommend Lindo as our \"go-to Mexican restaurant\" for special occasions anymore. Just too risky and disappointing lately. Not worth the money spent.  Posting a picture of 2 \"Erica\" dishes next to last night's dish so you can see the difference.",

Inside the place was equally impressive, and had a view from the bar of the Las Vegas Strip that was amazing. As an employee, I'm sure it doesn't get old.   Speaking of employees, the service was quick, friendly, and explained everything great. My family of four ordered a couple kids meals (bean burrito and enchilada), my wife got a chicken tostada, and I had a burrito which was originally a chile verde burrito, but I substituted the meat for lengua (beef tongue). The taste was awesome, and paired well with my ice cold Dos Equis. My wife also had a blended strawberry margarita which she enjoyed and I thought was very tasty.  Afterwards we all went outside to take pics with the strip in the background. Check this place out if you're in the Henderson area.",

It's closer to good TexMex with some authentic elements and a beautiful view of Las Vegas. That said, the service was fast and attentive as they accommodated some substitutes in their menus. Go here for the vibe and the view more than the food, though that's not bad either. If you're looking for more authentic Mexican places, I'd suggest a smaller hole in the wall type establishment.",

I was told that this place was GREAT for Mexican food and I took whomever's word for it.  The food is good but it is not that great although I do believe it comes down to what you order.  I usually steer away from the combination specials especially during lunchtime. They are a good value but you really get what you pay for. I have ordered a few lunch specials in the past that included the Chilie Relleno and it was so dry. The top of the Relleno had no sauce other than what was crusted on top. If you order the Relleno make sure you ask for extra sauce on top.  The more expensive specials are the way to go, remember you get what you pay for. I have ordered the Pollo con Rajas y Crema Estilo, the Mojarra and the Huchainango, all good but not enough for me to bring it to a four star. The Chile Relleno and my experiences with the lunch specials really make this place an average restaurant experience.  Now the views are great and the restaurant is clean and festive. As for the staff, sometimes they are wonderful and sometimes they seem to be going through the motions. Put those together and you have average again.  I really wished I liked this place better but like I said, MEH average!",

    "text": "08 MAR 2019 - Party of 7 celebrating a birthday that was not very enjoyable having chosen this restaurant to dine at. The food was very good but the service, the staff and the overall experience is what caused a 2-star rating.  We called ahead to make a reservation only to learn when we arrived that there was no reservation made. We were not the only party that had this same issue so it is clear that whoever was taking the phone calls just said whatever, hung up and moved on to the next task. The wait for a table once we arrived was supposed to be about 20 minutes but ended up being 42 minutes.  Once seated we ordered drinks but only the adult drinks were delivered (and I am talking about soda and iced tea). For some reason we had to ask again for the kids drinks (juices) before we finally got them.   We then placed our order which was the start to our extremely long wait. It was apparent they were grossly understaffed or under-equipped for the amount of tables they serve as we were served 4 rounds of chips, salsa and beans without asking and without charge. It was an just over an hour from the time we ordered until our meals were served. Two of the kids ordered their meals without beans and they were served with beans. I ordered my meal without cheese and it was serviced with cheese. Another 23 minutes later and the three meals were replaced while everyone else was nearly done eating.  At this point we had been in this restaurant more than 2.5 hours and we had collectively decided to go somewhere else for a celebratory piece of cake until my 6yo blurted out who's birthday it was (adult). The server disappears out of sight until the slow kitchen prepares a desert and a shot of tequila from the bar. Then several servers come to the table with a huge sombrero for the birthday to wear and they sing to him.  I am pretty sure it was right at 3 hours from the time we walked in the door that we finally walked out and while the food was really good it definitely does not make up for the overall poor experience.",

It is located on a hill with a beautiful view of the valley from the parking lot.  The restaurant itself is huge and nice looking on the inside. The servers seem nice, but unfortunately the food was nothing exciting. I ordered the carne asada medium rare (which was advertised on the menu as a NY steak). What was presented to me was a slab of dry, tough beef that was probably less than 1cm thick. It looked like it had been beat to death with a hammer 2 times. That was $20. Big disappointment. My wife got some kind of shrimp and avocado salad that was absolutely bland. I tried some myself and it was pretty disappointing.  For such a beautiful establishment, I feel like it's a better bar/drinking spot than a restaurant. I'm not likely to dine here again.",

I love the food and the environment especially at this location but idk if my server was new yesterday or what but he was terrible. I had to get a drink from the busser because the waiter wouldn't come around. I waited about 20 minutes for a preparada. Once it finally hit the table I ordered guacamole and a modelo. A guy comes out and drops the guacamole stuff by our table but doesn't make it. We watch sit there for about 20 minutes until finally someone comes and makes it. We ordered dinner and dinner came out at a decent time but my modelo is still nowhere in sight. How does an appetizer and a dinner beat a bottle beer to the table?? That's absolutely unacceptable. We get another friend to join us and the waiter didn't even ask her if she wanted a drink food or anything. just asked if water was ok. He never came back to get her order so we ask for the bill and left. Great food, great vibe, absolutely terrible service",

Walked in and the 360 views of Las Vegas and the mountains were breathtaking, along with the cute decor and waitresses in authentic outfits. Got seated in a corner with views of both sides and we were served warm tortilla chips with a nice spicy salsa and refried beans upon sitting down. Ordered a bunch of lunch specials and all of us were so pleased with our orders. I personally got fajitas because when you walk in, their open kitchen is to the left and there was someone there making fresh tortillas with a smile that looked SO GOOD! Food was 10/10. I was stuffed but someone recommended the dessert so we ordered a few of the fluffy cinnamon donuts, kinda like a soft churro pocket and they were delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone in this area and hope to visit again when I come back.",

    "text": "I love Lindo.  I do.  But after three or four visits, I've come to the realization that it's the atmosphere that I love, not the food.  Thus, I can only justify a three star rating.   I went here in December for a work Christmas party and got the surf and turf.  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out so incredibly rare that I could only eat the outside edges.  On top of that, I'm quite certain I could have gone to Albertson's for a better steak and I'm 110% certain that I could have cooked it better.  What really got me though was the lobster.  Never have I had a more overcooked, rubbery, dry lobster.  It was an incredible disappointment.  My more recent visits included ordering shrimp rellano that was pretty unremarkable and a pork chimichanga that was the last straw on my love/hate affair with Lindo Michoacan.  Maybe it's standard for a chimi but there was quite literally nothing inside the tortilla other than the meat.  No beans, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no guacamole.  Nada!  It was just dry and bland and not good at all.  I literally ate the rice and beans and called it a night.   Now for the good part.  The ambiance.  The atmosphere.  The entertainment.  The people.  The view!  All of those aspects are spot on here.  It's a fun spot especially for a group.  Loud, vibrant, decorated like a kitschy joint you might see across the border.  There's a one man mariachi band that's funny and entertaining as hell.  Take note that the wait is long.  Like really long.  Parking is almost nonexistent and usually the street next to the restaurant is lined with cars that couldn't find a spot in the main lot.  I've even seen people park at the closed business park across the street.   I wish so badly that the food was proportionate to the ambiance.  For me, it's just not.  Full disclosure: I'll probably be back just for the atmosphere...cross my fingers I find something on the menu that's muy bueno.",

First off, I want to say that our server Manny was the nicest and accommodating server I have ever had at this place, which was a nice breath of fresh air. I had questions on what the tamarindo and Jamaica juice were and he was kind enough to bring me a sample of each which I completely appreciated. I ended up satisfied with the tamarindo.   Second off I will suggest to get the guacamole for an appetizer. I love and appreciate that they make it fresh at the table. It is my favorite item on the menu for that exact reason.   Thirdly I will say that the reason I gave this place 3 stars is merely based on my personal preference in their food. I suppose I have yet to find an entree that I like. I have tried the tacos, Tortas and burritos and I haven't had a single entree I can say that I liked or enjoyed. also the menu can be vague and difficult to understand, especially if you don't know Spanish, but again that's were I commend Manny our server for answering all my questions and having patience with me!   So I appreciate that the service has moved up a notch or two since I've last been there! My time was very enjoyable I just wish there was something I could find that I could enjoy as well as my experience!! But I am happy that they have improved their staff and service and I guess I will be back to find something I love!! I am determined!!",

Soup was tasty, but everything else missed the mark. Enchiladas tasted burnt, tacos were cold and greasy, Chile Rellenos had congealed cheese. Prices were much higher than they needed to be for the dinner received.   As my sister-in-law stated, come for the service, not the food. Save yourself the money and order from Roberto's.",

Thankfully they give it to you with a sauce and some fresh lemon wedges, which you must drudge it in make it edible. So stinking elementary, I've had better fish tacos at Rubios. Sad.  My friend sent her chicken back, said it was rock hard and dry since it was so over cooked.   Service was barely there. And although the views are breathtaking, anyone at our table of 6 would jump a mile when they came out to celebrate a birthday. Bring your earplugs, but leave your tastebuds at home. They won't be used for anything here. Such a letdown.",

I got a combination plate of an enchilada, green chile burrito and a chicken taco and my boyfriend got the chicken fajitas. All of the accompanying spices and sauces were just too sweet. The soup was overly salted, the beans had no flavor. The tortilla chips were burnt and too thick.

Also the the chips, refried beans and red chili sauce they give you before your meal are so good! One more thing, the frozen mango margarita though...it's everything (I'm not even big on alcohol).",

    "text": "I absolutely love the food at this restaurant and my husband and I make it a point to eat here whenever we are in town. Delicious Mexican food with an awesome view of the strip. Fantastic!   My only complaint is that the portion sizes are really too large for one person. I don't like eating leftovers and so it just seems wasteful. They give you free chips served with bean dip and salsa as soon as you sit down and those are just to good to not eat. Plus, most meals come with a starter of fideo soup.  In addition, most of the entrees come with a heaping helping of rice and beans. The best remedy to the superfluous amount of food is to split an entree with someone or just order a la cart (though those items are limited).  My favorite meal here is the Shrimp Diablo. Tell them to make it extra spicy and you will be in for a real treat. I also love their Micheladas (that is my favorite drink to eat with Mexican food), though they call them something else here.  I love the upbeat atmosphere though sometimes when they have music it can get too loud.  We have always had excellent service from the waitstaff though I have noticed that the hostesses all seem to have some kind of chip on their shoulders.  As others have mentioned, try to avoid peak times or you will have trouble with parking and likely have to wait for a table.",

My favorite margarita is their mango margarita :) they have a late night happy hour that starts from 11pm-2am. (They also have an afternoon happy hour) Half off margaritas. It's a good time to go.

I stick to a couple things that are my fav: carne asada, enchiladas, fajitas. And definitely order the guacamole, they make it right at the table the way you like it, delish! This restaurant has a great view of the strip and they have a band playing traditional music. With that, it is very loud and very hard to talk. I don't recommend this place for large groups for that reason.   Helpful Tip: Take it easy on the chips. The waiters are on top of their shit so if you're getting low on chips, they will immediately spot it and refill your bowl... causing you to eat WAY too many chips and be completely full by the time your meal shows up. This situation never ends well since you feel obligated to eat a little of your meal even though there is absolutely no room for it.",

I thought onions and bell peppers were supposed to give flavor to the meat?  Whatever, I still ate it.  What's cool is they gave me two HUGE flour tortillas that were freshly made.

Good Mexican food is lacking in Henderson, NV.   The chips taste like they contain a sawdust filler as a binding ingredient.    Until this restaurant we have never experienced \"dry\" pico de gallo.  No lime or lemon!  Unbelievably they always use tomatoes that are near white as the tasteless onion they use.  Unsatisfying, tasteless and cheap ingredients.  There is a reason for the dim lighting in the restaurant and that is because if you could actually see the artificial color in the cheese, you might not eat the meal (sorry but I can't even call it food).  There is no pride in food at this establishment. It is over rated.  For excellent mexican food with flavor visit Leticia's, La Comida, Denudo or Mi Casa.  Taste the difference for yourself.",

I'm a huge fan of the Sahara and Eastern location and almost all others, but my entire party was disappointed with our experience here.  It has been said that the building they took over was formerly an Italian location with a fantastic view of the city and Lindo seems like they put up some cheap decor and painted the walls.  The location on Sahara and Eastern makes you feel like your in a traditional cantina with a bevy of fine tequila's and hispanic culture.    Onward to the food.... My girlfriend order the chimichangas which were a huge disappointment and had to be sent back.  We try to never send back food from both working in the restaurant industry.  Furthermore, my carne asada was tough and chewy.  I still ate my weight in bean and salsa dip along with everyone else.    I just would love to see the same consistency at the Henderson location that I'm used to from Lindo.  Not to worry..... I still plan on stopping in for fresh made tortillas often :)",

We told the waiter it was my friends birthday and they went around and sang happy birthday to 4 different tables and never acknowledge us!  My husband had a steak salad.  My cousin had tacos. She said they were 'Roberto's good'.  So for what we paid. We are NEVER coming back.  Overpriced. Dissapointing!",

    "text": "First off this place has an outstanding view of the valley at night which to me, was better than the food. Our party (5 of us) pulled in around 8:00 tonight, quickly seated and the staff and service is 5 stars, I cant say enough how well the service operates here it flows very efficiently we didn't have to ask for anything. The food was ok, I was hoping for more flavor . The bean dip was pretty good, the salsa wasn't super, it wasn't hot enough and was a little bland, we asked for some hotter and it came out and yes it was hotter but lacked some flavor behind the heat, the chips I thought were a little too cooked, I've had better chips and salsa elsewhere. Main course comes out and like I said it was ok, nothing special, nothing stood out, almost like the chef has no passion or is told to not spice anything up. It came out within 15 mins and was nice and hot. All in all, we would go back for drinks I suppose and for the view, but until their food matches the rest of the establishment I probably wont eat here again. It's a shame because its a beautiful location, well staffed, upscale authentic sort of vibe, but the food just falls short of expectations.  I have to say this again though, the staff, servers, waiters, are all superior. Excellent service here. Just please get a real chef with passion or do something to fix the bland issue  , that food might pass off as awesome to some of the less traveled/versed public, but I expected better.  Oh yes people in our party said the margaritas were muy bueno, and strong hehe.  On another note, I ordered the a supposed overnight marinated chicken dish in a red sauce. Ok, now its the only dish under chicken that says it is marinated overnight in special seasoning or what have you....Ok, if it was marinated overnight it was marinated in salt water and that's it. It definitely didn't taste like it had a good marinade soak it was tender and juicy but had minimal flavor. So, Lindo, fix that or rephrase that menu item because I'm fairly certain that wasn't marinated at all. About 97.5% sure that it wasn't.",

    "text": "We came here for an early father's day dinner. The first thing we encountered was a breathtaking view of the strip and downtown through the massive wall size windows. You can sit at the bar and have a fantastic view facing the strip or asked to be seated on the lower level for a birds eye view of the strip and the old Vegas strip.     Once you are seated prepare for some live music from a guitar picker playing to a track not far from your table. The songs were all in Spanish, but it wasn't hard to pick out an Elvis or Sinatra tune from the playlist, which made the whole experience fun and unique.      The service at Lindo's is excellent. They have the model correct. In addition to the table server, there is a food runner and separate drink runners. The result is someone returning to your table about every 5 minutes to bring appetizers, drink refills and the food/dessert order.       The menu is a little hard to understand if you don't know Spanish, but it's a small mis-step in the overall experience. One thing that I noticed that was a little odd is that all of the management, kitchen cooks and floor servers were male. There wasn't one female on the floor besides the two hostesses that were greeting guests at the front door. I assume that this is the format in a traditional restaurant in Mexico.      Everything was Perfecto from our first impression to the server Jorge shaking my hand at the end of our experience. For tasty Mexican food and excellent service, go to Lindo's in the heart of Henderson. We will be back many more times",

As a party of 8 without reservations, we were seated surprisingly fast! Our table was towards the back, behind the bar area, in a room with several large windows with a spectacular view --- The entire restaurant sits cozily on a high hill, overlooking the suburbs and cityscape.  Service was quick & friendly as well. They're super slick with the chip & drink refills, which can be dangerous. I've always said that my one superpower is filling up on chips & salsa before my actual food gets there...  Anyway, it was a great experience! The normal entrees are pretty pricey (I would say $20 being the average), but they do have a margarita happy hour & a lunch menu that lasts until 5:00 PM with well over 20 options to choose from - a lot of them simply being cheaper, downsized versions of their dinner dishes.",

If you let the staff know that a party member is celebrating a birthday, they get a surprise tequila shot! What's funny is that it seems like every table is celebrating a birthday because shots were being taken at literally every table! The view is the main event, however. Sitting on top of a hill, you get an amazing view of the entire strip if you're lucky enough to get a window seat. If you don't, you can always check out the view before or after your meal. Parking can get hairy sometimes, and it's not uncommon to have to park on the street. Moving on to the food, they have your typical Mexican cuisine, but they also have some special dishes, my favorite being the birria goat stew. Don't forget to order the table-side prep Guacamole!",

I had a mango margarita which I could not finish due to the amount of alcohol. I'm not a drinker so it hit be before my meal came out. I'm definitely not complaining, but be ready for it!   My husband had the traditional grilled chicken enchiladas and I ordered a chicken dinner off the specialty menu, which was amazing.   I give this place 2",

They forgot to make our fresh guacamole that we had ordered for an appetizer and brought out our main courses first.  All the dishes were barely warm.  When they did make the guacamole, it tasted terrible.  Way too much lime and jalapenos.  We couldn't finish it and asked for a refund.  Both plates of enchiladas were lacking in sauce and tasted very dry.  Definitely won't be going back.",

The size of the bowl did not match the quantity of actual menudo. There is no hominy in their menudo, which is fine, but the tripe-soup ratio was definitely off. Also, I was really craving an horchata and they said they were all out. Bummer.  The service was fine and the views were spectacular, which is why I gave two stars. I could have gotten a better Menudo at Fausto's down the street for about half the price. I've been here twice, but probably won't be coming back again.",

The waiter looked at me and said are you sure !?!? He asked me 2 times, again making a scene out of a very simple request. I pulled out my phone and showed him my previous YELP review showing that I was refused the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow. I told him to just please just place the order. I had to assure him that I would not return the item.  When he picked up my plate he made a rude and racial comment that I was the only \"gringo\" that he has seen finish the meal. He said that he had 3 \"gringos\" order it and not finish it before me.  Also we ordered 2 margaritas and 1 beer that were never delivered. We where not charged for them so we did not complain.   All I want to do is to place an order for an item on your menu without a hassle. What is the problem with your severs ? You lost $30 in liquor because they were too worried about the \"gringo\"'s order.  You should just take this item off the menu if you are unwilling to serve it.",

My best friend raved about this place ever since I told her I was moving to Vegas from California and needed to discover new Mexican restaurants to help curb my insatiable craving. She mentioned how much she loved Lindo so I gave it a shot -- but girl you are trippin'.  Lindo Michoacan is overpriced, bland, and flavors were just flat out weird. The salsas lacked that kick that I love and expect from freshly made salsa. The decor was a chain restaurant nightmare. However portions were big if you like that kind of thing and the view is quite beautiful.   The search for delicious Mexican food in Vegas continues! (Please, any suggestions are welcome!)",

Shortly after Iexcused myself from the table, leaving my cup at the table. Upon my return I noticed my cup was gone. Disappeared. Who our server was, was not immediately clear. The first person to approach our table I asked where my cup was. Clearly someone removed it. This person didn't speak english & shrugged his shoulders & left. Another man asked me what was wrong as I clearly was annoyed & looking for someone...I explained the cup I walked in with disappeared from the table & I wanted it back. His solution?  He brought me ice tea...what was in my cup. 3 more people later and NO ONE could tell me where my cup was let alone why it was removed from the table.   Cups of soup were served to our table of 7. Again, having already eaten I was in no hurry to eat this. A few minutes after receiving it someone comes by & removes the soup from in front of me. I tell him to leave it but he takes it anyway. Charged for soup yet never allowed to eat it. Not cool.   First my cup, now my soup. My friends were worried THEIR food would face the same fate. And they were right to worry. Not 5 minutes after receiving their entrees the same person comes by & starts clearing plates...WHILE THEY ARE EATING!!    Are you kidding me? How does anyone actually eat here?  You're not allowed to. This place was packed. Did I miss something?  Oh!  That would be my food.   This place sits atop a hill with a fantastic view of the valley. Car park is small. No Parking signs on the street yet people parked here anyway.  1 star for the view.   I never got my cup back.",

The problem is the host staff whereby they will tell you the wait is about 30 minutes. That is not the case. I believe they need to be forthright with their customers so the expectation is not ruined because of the long wait. I think they tell people the less time so people don't leave. This is definitely not a good management policy.  Other than that, we have enjoyed the food and the wait staff each time we have been here.",

The service is excellent and the people working here are quick, knowlegable, and friendly. Other than that, I wouldn't say the food is terrible but it's definitely not good. Not sure if they just use bad quality meat but it's just chewy and tasteless. I've tried here quite a few times and same results with almost all the meats on their menu. I basically come here now for drinks and the view. Also the parking is terrible but not.much they can do about that not really their fault, the place is usally pretty packed. Again, I'm not saying it's a bad place but food wise just not the best or neccesarly authetnic either.",

When I first got there I was impressed by the ambiance - there are huge windows with a great view of the valley below. There's also a band that does some live music. I had hopes for some good Mexican food as I don't really have a Mexican restaurant here in Vegas that I love. But this place was definitely a let-down. From the super spicy and not good salsa, to both the entree I ordered (bland steak fajitas) and the waiter-recommended entree that my husband ordered (ribeye with cilantro sauce - the steak was just not very quality, very fatty), this place was just a disappointment. I don't drink, but the people in our group that did were quite surprised when they got their hefty checks at the end of the meal.  I do have to say that the service was great. But other than the service and the ambiance, this place doesn't have much to offer.",

I believe all of their locations are family owned, and that shows in the quality of the food. Everything feels very homemade, especially the tortillas which you can watch them make through a window. The views from this location are breathtaking! It was a huge glass wall with incredible views of the strip. You will need to make a reservation if you want a table with a view, however, as I've been here countless times and only had a view the one time I made a reservation. The staff here is always curious and I like the music here, they always have musicians, but they aren't too loud or distracting like at some other Lindo locations I've been to. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant, and specifically this location to anyone who would listen!",

Nothing fresh and all terribly bland.  View was pretty good, but didn't compensate for the awful food.  Waitstaff did some corny Mariachi birthday thing for a table nearby.  I felt bad for both the staff and the birthday table.  Serving staff did try pretty hard though.  If it wasn't for the decent service (in spite of the corny Mariachi routine) we'd have given it one star.  It's not like we got sick or anything, but it was so bland and canned tasting that I can honestly say I've had better Mexican food from a TV dinner out of the frozen food section of the supermarket.

Bartender making awesome house margaritas and other specialty drinks. Waiters are knowledgable about the menu and always have great suggestions. Each waiter has helpers (Nacho is the best!) that refill drinks and help serve. This means I'm always taken care of.  The food is great, big portions, flavorful and lots to choose from. You start off with a bowl of refried  beans, salsa and chips as soon as you sit down. They are quick to refill these items! My house margarita on the rocks was perfect balance of tequila and sour. Most meals come with a side of refried beans, rice and salad. Best dishes are Camerones Abuelito (bacon wrapped shrimp) and my favorite Camerones Tia Esther , a blend of spices and cream.

    "text": "We used to love Lindo Michoacan! My go-to food is mexican.  It was Thursday night and we arrived around 11. Someone greeted us, and took us over to a table with a spectacular view.  We were starving so I ordered table side guac. It was fun to watch them prepare it. I am about to start to dig in the guac when I notice a HAIR in it. So grossed out I tell our bald waiter there's a hair in this guac. He grabs it to examine, and simply shrugs and says, \"oh that is just from the avocado peel.\"   REALLY? Since when do avocados have hair?  He hastily goes to make another. He really just seemed annoyed at the fact that I even asked. The rest of the dinner I sit there inspecting every bite.   I understand that sometimes small mistakes like this happen, but I felt the waiter (or manager, I couldn't tell who he was) could have handled this better. He seemed really annoyed that we asked them to re-make it.  Worst part of it all is that we had an $90 dollar meal, and they didn't even comp the guacamole.I'm not expecting a free meal but at least don't charge me for that hairy guacamole.   This dinner just left a bad taste in my mouth. I most likely will NOT return to that establishment.",

Unfortunately, this is the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten in my life. They bring out chips with salsa and beans at first. The salsa is like watery hot sauce, and the beans have this bizarre \"cafeteria\" taste. I ordered a dish with carne asada and the meat tasted like it was boiled. No flavor at all. I've eaten Mexican food in Mexico, California, Texas, etc, and I've never had anything like this. I don't know what their doing here, but the food just doesn't taste right. I wonder if it's because there's a lot of white people in the neighborhood and they think we like bland food??",

After we were seated someone came to our table to take a drink order, once we gave it to him he abruptly looked around then quickly walked away. He went up to another worker and they looked confused. A short time later we got our drinks from another server and never saw the first guy again. The second server was very attentive to the table.   Anyway, on to the food. Let's start by saying I'm very picky about Mexican food. I don't care for places that only serve Menudo on weekends...and guess when they serve it. That's right, only on weekends!! So I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos were very good. I had them leave off the pico de gallo because I like mine old school (meat, onion, cilantro, salsa and a squeeze of lime). The rice and beans were so-so. The chips and salsa that come before the meal were good. They also serve a small bowl of fideo (basically a noodle soup in tomato sauce and broth), it was alright, nothing like the fideo I ate growing up.   I gave LM a 3 because it's OK. Nothing about it blew me away or stands out. I will definitely go back but it's not a place I would say \"you have to try it!!\". But, go for the view and some decent food.",

They give you fresh salsa and beans with chips to start you off, then they give you a little bowl with sopa de fideo. Both were so good. The amount of food they give you is definitely worth the money. I had the camarones Stephanie and they were so tasty. The aguachiles are also a must try!",

The lighting was so low that my father had to request a flashlight to read the menu. The waiter actually REFUSED and said the owner liked it dark.  Then about 30 minutes later he came back with one (after I read the menu for my dad and we had ordered).  Who tells a 70 year old man \"no you can't have a flashlight to read the menu because the owner likes it dark in here?\"  2. My husband recieved the wrong order and tried to eat it thinking that all mexican food is good.  It wasn't so he didn't even eat a quarter of it.  3. My meal, the shrimps, were charred on the outside and raw on the inside.   I had two shrimp and of course couldn't eat anymore.  I actually got sick at home.  I asked to speak with the manager and he or she never came.    I paid my bill because I didn't want to be accused of dine and dash.     I went to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager.  The place was too busy, again, the manager never came.  So I went home  That night I went to their facebook and wrote them a message asking for a response or I would go to my bank for a claim.   They never got back to me.  I filed a claim with my bank and of course it was denied.   Lindo Michoacan LIED to my bank and said we completed our meals and that we NEVER asked for a manager.   They pointed out I left a tip.   Of course I left a tip, I am not going to punish the waiter for the Chefs poor cooking or the Managers refusal to deal with a customer complaint.  I am also not going to leave a bill unsettled and be acuse of a crime.   Lindo Michoacan LIED about me not writing them a message on their facebook.    This establishment has bad food, poor service and unethical management - this type of establishment is bad for our community and for our recovering economy.  Who wants to have a lying crapy restaruant in their town?",

They are just giving people raw chiles also the camarones chiles rellenos raw. It's disgusting for the third time trying to eat this food; but it's impossible.

The last time we were there we had the best assistant to the waiter. His name is Andres and he should definitely be considered for a promotion. Thanks to him and the chefs, we had another fabulous dinner.",

Right when we say we were brought chips, salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was amazing and quickly disappeared. I ordered the organic margarita which was delicious and my friend got the frozen coconut margarita which I tried and was also very good. I definitely suggest getting the table side guacamole, made right in front of you so you can choose which ingredients you'd like. We also shared the shrimp ceviche which surprisingly I liked even though I'm not a huge ceviche fan.  After a few rounds of drinks and so many chips we were too full to order anything else. Service was great, our server Angel was very attentive and so were the bussers and helpers. I highly recommend this place for a great night, view, food and drinks!",

Nice room, great view, nice surprise with the hot bean dip that came out with the chips and salsa, very good margarita, excellent tortillas and my camarones a la diabla was very nicely done.

I told a few people how they would ignore me and it seemed like they would go out of their way to not help me. Nobody believed me until I went with someone that was a regular there (that they always treated well). He witnessed first hand how I was intentionally ignored, particularly when there were only a few other people there. I never complain or act rude so it was very odd and something I've never experienced before.  I haven't been there in a long time now and don't plan on going back.",

    "text": "Seated up on a hill near Anthem, this location is breathtaking. If you can, avoid the main dining area and get a table near the windows. When I came here it was a beautiful, clear day, so you have an unobstructed view of the city.   When you sit down you are welcomed with a bowl of warm chips, a side of salsa, and refried beans. The chips are addicting and you might be surprised by how fast they go, but do not worry, the staff will refill it for you.  Our server was a little hard to find, but the hostess and busser came to take our drink orders and then refilled them frequently. Two baskets of chips in, our waiter came around to take our order. This normally would not be a problem, but one person was on a lunch break from work. After another twenty to thirty minutes we got our order. If you have the time to wait, this place is good, but avoid if you have a time restraint.  We got cheese enchiladas, carnitas, carnitas burrito, and the steak skewers. The friend who got the enchiladas liked her dish. The carnitas were seasoned well, but some pieces were really dry. I slathered my in salsa and guacamole. My friend who loves carnitas could not finish his. To give you an idea about how much he loves carnitas, he ate them three meals a day for three days straight while on a business trip.  He also said that he wanted to spit a bite out because it was more like chewing gum than meat. The skewers were the best. Moist and tender with gorgeous pieces of peppers and onion. The portion size is enormous, for $15, it is a great deal for two.   Overall, the view is what you are paying for.",

    "text": "Ok this was my first visit to an establishment OTHER than my doctors office as a handicapped person. So I am giving them 5 stars based on a few reasons. First the hostess saw me coming in on my knee scooter with my big boot/cast thing and she immediately grabbed the door for me, Then She sat my sister and I at the closest table with an easy access to get in and out of a chair. I was starving after my doctor's appointment and this was my first time getting to eat out since I have been out with my foot problem.   The bus boy helped me get situated and helped me get my scooter under the table. Then he took our drink order and brought my iced tea and chips and salsa.  I ordered a chimichanga and my sister ordered the tacos .   Bonus: they have like 32 lunch specials. So you have a ton of different combinations to like order from.   We ordered the fresh guacamole YUM. I could barely eat though .. But everything I had was delicious. I had it wrapped up because I KNEW that leftovers would be awesome.   My busboy .. kept my glass filled, and helped me get my food into cartons.   It was extremely exhausting to be out after being on bedrest for the last 5 weeks, so I did not do desert and it was good to go home.   But I definitely will be back it was a great time.",

The staff were all courteous and helpful; meals came out quick (despite the staff constantly checking the USA vs. Mexico Soccer game that was going on, it was apparently a big deal. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just impressive multitasking).   The food is excellent. Nothing bizarre, leans more authentic than most \"authentic\" Mexican places, but just quality versions of familiar food. I would trust the steak and seafood here. The guacamole being made in front of you is amazing, and it allows your to steal the recipe (it also appears to be a lot of work)   Our waiter, Rene, was on the ball and had quality suggestions. The Mango Mojitos ARE spectacular. The other busing staff executed excellently. My Cadillac Margarita was almost too strong. Which is how I like it.   SUPER MEGA BONUS: The first Mariachi Band that did not annoy me. Not only did they do a splendid job of traditional tunes, they had a delightful version of Charlie Daniel's Devil goes down to Georgia (I am not a hillbilly; it was just a good rendition.) and at no point did they beg for tips or get intrusive. Excellent stuff.",

Starting with their table-prepared guacamole is a must. The margaritas are strong and well made. One of my favorites entrees is their Gallo al Conac - chicken breast in a creamy cognac sauce - but you can hardly go wrong.   The wide open dining room has a lively energy to it, if sometimes a bit loud. The servers are fast and friendly. There's live music nearly every night, it seems.  The building is situated on a hill, and has enormous windows running the full length of the restaurant, giving it one of the nicest views of any Henderson restaurant.  If you've got the taste for Mexican, you really can't go wrong with Lindo Michoacan.",

It is terrible.  The people who had been there before in our party basically screamed a loud \"NO\" when the put that soup down in front of them . . . and told them to take it away.  The chicken burrito I had lacked flavor . . . it was not marinated or seasoned at all.  It was like they just threw chicken in a tortilla and called it a day.  Three of us in our party all had this and all agreed that it was the worst burrito EVER and that Del Taco makes batter food.  One person found chicken bones and grissle in her burrito . . . she currently has an upset stomach and will most likely throw up.  This place should be shut down it is that bad . . . yet there is a huge wait each night to get gross food . . . I just don't get it.  The only thing that is nice about the place is the view . . .but that is spoiled by how loud this place is . . . you can't hear the person next to you.  So come on people . . . ..take your business elsewhere . . .this place frankly offers some of the worst Mexican food I have ever experienced.",

    "text": "We visited this location on a very busy Sunday-Mother's Day 2013. It coincidentally was my son's 13th birthday, and he chose the restaurant (good choice, son).  We walked in, expecting a crowd because it was prime lunch time on the most sacred of days for Mothers.  Our wait was about 25 minutes. We lucked out were able to sit in the waiting area (some had to stand, as they were busy).  We were greeted to be seated, and each female that the staff assumed was a Mother, was given a pretty carnation flower, a nice Mother's Day touch. They were hesitant on giving me one (hopefully because I looked too young to birth the 3 monsters in tow), but once they read my tank top that says 'Best Mom Ever', I was gifted a carnation.  We were brought to our table, which had gorgeous views of the Vegas strip. The decor is pretty authentic, and the live Mariachi band made me feel like I was back in Cancun on vacation. Unlimited chips, beans and salsa. I had the most delicious Pina Colada that by the time we had ordered our food, I was feeling VERY good. My 3 kids were also enjoying the live band, who were walking around from table to table.  Service was a bit slow, the wait to receive our food was a little longer than desired, but all was alright because the band, the non stop chips, and my amazing pina coladas made our experience actually FUN. The kiddos were rockin' out and didn't ask me once when their food was going to arrive (thats a first!).  We finished our meal, and were suddenly bombarded (in a good way) by the whole Mariachi band at our table, armed with churros loaded with whipped cream, and a huge sombrero, for my birthday boy to wear. The whole restaurant joined in to sing Happy Birthday.   It was truly a perfect day, thanks to delicious food and drink, great service, great experience, and sharing my special day with my firstborn.",

    "text": "I have seen some pretty bad reviews about this place, but I am not going to be writing one of \"those\". This restaurant left me happy, well fed and highly impressed. I will however point out the few things that may turn certain types of eaters off. First off, it is very loud inside, not just because of the live music (which was upbeat and entertaining, although maybe a little corny at times) but also because this restaurant seems to be very popular, and for good reason! The parking is a little tight too, so I recommend going at a normal dinner time (5 or 6 o'clock), rather than the classic \"8 o'clock\" time that one might normally take a date to dinner. Insignificant gripes aside, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic restaurant! The servers were attentive, helpful in every way, were happy to help explain the dishes and also accommodating (had one person in my party who had specific needs) in an understanding and respectful manner. The menu is gargantuan, which some people may not like, but I personally appreciate having options. You can go to their website and review the menu in advance if you want to save time.  Now for the food... I was in a party of five, we all had different dishes, everything came fairly quickly and every member of my party made ZERO complaints (believe me, I was with people who would have complained had they had reason to)! Tortilla chips and an assortment of dips were provided very shortly after being seated. Upon request (do so immediately!) they will make guacamole right at your table, I think it was $6 for the guac dip but I tell you it was worth every penny. I cannot speak for my companions' dishes but my dish, the chipotle chicken was cooked perfectly, portioned well and hot damned delicious! But alas, my review has dragged on too long. If you are still reading, please ignore the whiners and nay-sayers. Give this place a try. It is highly unlikely that you will regret it, unless you are one of \"those\" ;)",

If  you are used to having tacos, nachos, burritos, quesadilla, taco salads, or items from Chipotle and Baja Fresh or Zabas, then don't expect more of the same.  If your idea of good Mexican food is El Jefe, or Chevy's, then just put on a different view point for this place.  2.  It is...- The food here is the real deal and it is very, very tasty.  How many places can to go to order  caldo de res (beef soup)?  Or even the Birria (Goat Stew)? This stuff is authentic.  3.  Parking??? Que Paso - How many restaurants are you aware of in Vegas, where you have to park on the street or across the street because the already large lot is so full of guests?  4. All this means...- This place is a great place. It is real food, so you have to critique it as real food. The salsa is wonderful, the tortilla hand made.    5.  Music and Decor - Be careful going on nights and weekends when they are playing music. It can be a bit loud.  6.  Reservations - The staff is a bit on the non efficient side. Be careful.  And, the place is busy....  Try it, Try real Mexican Food,  Ask the waiter for what is really authentic. You will find it here. By the way, yes it was an italian restaurant in the past, but the place back then was never full and never that good. This place ROCKS.",

    "text": "I love it here! I came for the first time last night and I thought it was awesome! After reading all the yelp reviews, I wanted to try it. The place was packed when we got here but we only waited for about ten minutes. When we got seated, they gave us the best seat in the house. We had a beautiful view of the strip, it was so nice.   I loved the authentic feel and mariachi music. All of the employees had nice Mexican uniforms on. The margaritas were fantastic! First we tried the mango margaritas, soooo delicious! Second time around, my husband had the peach and I tried the skinny margarita. Both were also fantastic! We had the table side guacamole. It was so cool to watch the waiter prepare the guacamole right at our table. I've never had that before. Let me tell you.....that was the BEST guacamole I've ever had! It was so delicious and fresh. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it, lol. For dinner, my husband had the beef tongue mole, it was also very delicious. I can't remember the name in Spanish of what I had but it consisted of large shrimp and a spicy sauce. It was delicious as well but very spicy for my taste. I was also surprised at the side of the shrimp. The menu called them \"giant\" and they weren't very giant. However, everything was delicious and the service was excellent! Will definitely be back!!",

Anyone who has been here knows how busy it gets so having the choice of where to sit made a very good impression on me. They made the evening extra special with the addition of churros and tequila (can't really go wrong there!). My only reason for taking away 1 star is because some of the items on the menu could be a little better. I've had better chili relleno at other places. I would definitely go back though...their margaritas are the best!",

Getting a table along the windows give you the scenic overview of the city with the strip in sight.  Service during the lunch hour is solid.  They were good about refills with several different people checking on our table.    We decided to split the Queso and Chicken Fajitas.  The Queso hardened up quickly. You pretty much had a lump of cheese after the first minute it's sitting on the table.  The chorizo mixed in gave it a good flavor but I wish it was a bit more creamy so it could be dip worthy for longer.    I wish I would have known their Fajitas had cilantro covering the entire plate.  Usually fajitas have a good seasoning without mixing in cilantro on top of it.  I can handle some but it was excessive.  The shells served with it weren't the regular fajita size but almost burrito size. For what I prefer this dish was just ok.    I can always find something else to try but Lindo wouldn't be my first choice for Mexican food.",

The servers are beyond kind and very personable! But it saddens me to take away a star; this is only because when the food came out, it was not hot - just warm. Granted - we did have a large group! So it can get difficult getting everything out at once I suppose. Regardless, everything tasted wonderful and the drinks were just as fantastic. You get chips and salsa as you wait for you're meal, and enjoy their delicious margaritas ;) If you request for a seat by the back windows, you can get a lovely view outside too.   Overall, very memorable evening.",

Even though it was an hour wait (totally worth it), the staff was attentive and fast! It was literally the best staff I have ever encountered. If I had hundreds of dollars to tip them, I would have!   The place was insanely busy and my water was STILL filled 5+ times. Since it was busy, it was noisy but it honestly didn't bother me. The atmosphere was incredibly fun because there was something happening in every corner. Music and \"Happy Birthday\" going off in every corner! We asked them to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to my aunt and a handful came over with a sombrero, put it on her head, started singing, and then gave her little tequila shots! It was the best ever.   I haven't even talked about the AMAZING food yet! It was hands down the best tacos I have ever had in my life. I have shrimp and carne asada tacos. I couldn't get over how delicious it was. The carne asada was perfectly flavored and just melted in my mouth. The shrimp was really to die for. It was also nice that they gave out beans with the chips and salsa.   If you want a relaxing day with amazing meal, I suggest coming on Sunday during lunch. I went again on Sunday after the crazy Friday night and it was more laid back. There was no wait and we had an amazing view of Las Vegas. The view would have been 10000x better at night with those lights but it was still great. The service was still A1. I also tried the ceviche was of course, great. I am weird with seafood but I trusted this place. I'm glad I did.  All in all, try this place out! You won't regret it.",

Hostess( don't remember her name, she's blonde ) asked if we had a reservation, I said \"no, sorry girl\" she rolled her eyes and said \"of course\" which I thought was a bit rude. I get it though, I work in the industry so sometimes we may come off rude unintentionally because we're busy. Our server was fantastic, food was excellent, vibe was great! Loved the mariachi! Oh and the delicious churros for dessert. All staff from manager, bussers, food runners and hostesses were on their total redbull and roller skates game! Good job y'all!

    "text": "I have waited 6 days to write a review as I wanted it to be objective and not emotional. I was invited to a party here.   The booking was for 25 people at 7pm. Those of us that arrived at 7pm were sat at a table with the Party Girl. As people arrived, it was clear there was no seating for them. The restaurant had sat us at a wrong table that wasn't large enough.   I offered to move as I am a work colleague and not family. I was squished in a small booth with 4 other people. We were given a plate of beans, some salsa and some chips and a few utensils. So now we are not on the main table, that's ok, the girls are fun.  I asked for water as soon as we sat down. It didn't come.   We were then moved to a table that was added on to the original table. I sat down, asked for water and they set the places. I had no mat and no fork. I asked for water again, it still didn't come.   Everyone was given a soup bowl apart from me. I ordered fajitas and when they came, had to find a fork to eat them with. I asked for water again and got a glass. I chose to eat the fajitas off of the skillet and leave the sides to take home to Larry.   I asked for another glass of water, it never came.   When the waiter came to clear my plate, I said to him I needed a box for the sides. He said 'are you finished?' And pointed to the skillet. I said yes but need a box for the sides. He picked up the sides and put them on a dirty plate. When I told him no, I want a box to take them home, he scolded me and said in a huff 'you said you was finished', I said yes I am but I made it clear from the off, I needed a box. I still didn't get a refill on the water.   So in summary, I sat at three different place settings, had two glasses of water in two hours, didn't have a place mat or fork, didn't get soup and got told off by the waiter at the end of the meal.   No, I would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I've been to Lindo Michoacan on desert inn so many times since it had been just a hole in the wall restaurant. So I give this place 5 stars based on the food and the ambiance on its own.   However, my mom called this place to ask for the wait time and asked in Spanish. The woman said hold on a minute and then left my mom on the phone for 7 minutes - we could hear the background noise of the restaurant the entire time. I decided to call again and the same lady answered me (based on the sound of her voice) and when I asked her what the wait time was she answered me right then and there.   I could understand if she didn't speak Spanish so was unable to answer my mom, BUT in a Mexican restaurant it would not have taken her 7 minutes to find someone who did speak Spanish. I just thought it was disrespectful.",

And they make they're own tortillas fresh by the entrance where you can watch while you wait, If there's even a wait. The view is amazing also ! After a year of living in Las Vegas this has stayed my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant and probably always will! Love you Lindo Michoacan !",

ALL of the employees here are always friendly & polite & working super hard to get u seated & fed asap. There is a talented gentleman who sings & plays guitar on weekends, idk if he's there all the time, but I love hearing him. They also have an awesome view of vegas from the bar & the balcony room w/ all the big windows. I usually get veggie fajitas, the only thing I would change is less veggies, MORE guacamole! It's just too many veggies for a meal, I always take home a box. They have salsa roja & salsa verde, both are delicious, my husband likes to mix them together. They also bring out fideo soup before your meal. You will never leave this place hungry that's for sure!",

The servers helpers are quick in getting you chips beans,salsa and drinks. I will continue to eat here because we love the food and atmosphere. The one small complement I have is sometimes the servers are not at the top of there game. That is the only reason I did not give a 5 star rating. But I recommend if your looking for great Mexican food good drinks this place is it.",

The only problem is that there's too much good food between the bean dip, fideo soup, and tableside guacamole, that I am stuffed when I'm only a third of the way through my main course. But that's what leftovers are for. I also love the live music, and the views are fabulous! Definitely a great, fun meal!",

A nail tech told us about this place and after reading reviews we thought \"okay\" we'll try it.   The view is unbelievable, the margaritas were amazing and food was perfect.   I strayed from normal lunch order which a tostada and tried the Carnitas which I'm super picky about. They did disappoint.  Crispy, tasty and served hot.  I normally would order corn tortillas but was told their flour ones were \"homemade\" so I tried them. OMG the best.  Perfect     They bring great chips and salsa and bean dip to start. So good and the view. This place is great and I will definitely be back",

I love that they serve bean dip with your chips and salsa. It had a great flavor and the salsa had a roasted taste which was a nice change.   I got the chipotle cessation salad which was really tasty. The best part of it was the cornbread they served with it. It was moist, sweet, and slightly charred from the pan they cook it in. Really pleased we went there!",

If you desire breakfast I can recommend the Huevos Divorciado with fried eggs with a green sauce on one and a red sauce on the other with beans, rice & tortillas. I always love their freshly made tortillas, corn or flour. Lunch for me is always a toss up between Pollo con rajas e crema (chicken with poblanos in a cream sauce) or the Chili Rellenos. My not giving a fifth star is largely attributable to the chicken dishes which are made with chicken breast having been very tough & chewy the last few visits. They have a full house here at lunch and dinner times so I've learned to come at off times to avoid the rush. Service is typically attentive and friendly, we come here often, especially for birthdays since they make it so fun with a shot of tequila and a sombrero!  We have on occasion found some of the waitstaff to be a bit surly but if I can, I always request our favorite server, Octavio. He's kind & always considerate of our special needs girl in a wheelchair. Yesterday we met a new busboy there that was very sweet, named Walfer (yea not a typo). It's noisy and has a high energy most of the time & has great views.  I don't think it will disappoint, especially if you begin with a Margherita & table side guacamo",

I used the lighting from the bright window to see the menu. It was funny because I noticed two others doing the same thing.  The lunch menu offerings were standard. Nothing spectacular. There were no stand out offerings that we had ordered. The chips and salsa were bland. The fresh guacamole we ordered was made so carelessly and quickly with this \"lets get this over with attitude.\" Our server over-salted it. Big time. It was inedible. It was a disappointing lunch experience as we brought our friend from Belgium here to sample the authentic food. We will never return to this location.",

Not a bad beer selection, and the margaritas are pretty good also. All around a great spot, and definitely a place in our standard rotation!",

Best place to go for a girls night, date night or special occasion especially if you call ahead for a table near a window for night or even day time views of the Vegas valley!  The menu has many delicious items, the fish tacos, the pollo azado burrito, the spicy pork carnitas(food network) and the table side guacamole.  The Cadillac margarita is delicious!!!! The dessert of the fried ice cream is amazing but when ordering make sure you ask for the flameado! That's the best dessert!",

Long list of different types of margaritas but no matter which one you order they're all exactly the same. Yet you pay a premium for the tequila in it.

The chips and bean dip are very good (hard not to fill up on them, in fact).  They have some atypical items on the menu, which is always nice. My daughter is a big fan of the unusual items (goat, tongue, etc.) whereas I stick with a more traditional line (Carnitas, Chile Rellenos).  While the food is good and plentiful, it could be a bit spicier and a bit more imaginative. The Rellenos need more cheese and less batter.  Does every dish have to come with beans and rice?  (Admittedly, their beans and rice are better than most.)  My biggest complaint with most Mexican food in Vegas (and this applies to Chinese food here most of the time, too) is that it's too bland.  Spice is life, people!!!  ;D",

The only few things we disliked here was that there is too much going on and our waiter didn't come once to see how things were, or we needed anything more (which we did), he came at the end of our meal to offer dessert and the check.   We were trying to get his attention but he was too strung out.  So this is what we didn't like, one who puts children near speakers? (children need to be placed away from the DJ and speakers)  The greeters need a little more training on that, a fail on management.  Another fail, from management is the singing of the Happy Birthday to guest. Great idea, but don't take the waiters / waitresses away from their tables.  Keep the help, the food runners, waiters & waitresses doing their job and create another job for other positions there that don't have that big of an impact to your operations.  Such as, your three overwhelming greeters, use two to sing and alternate them as needed. Use the manager walking around as the other singer and that singing DJ too.  Now, you have a team of singers who won't impact your operations as you did before.  The last thing that was just as annoying as everything else failing here was that darn cow .  Are we at the NFR? This is crazy, employees were even cringing when they had to hit it.  It was just too much.  Why at the restaurant? In the middle of the dinning room, what? Good food but the environment needs to be controlled.",

We were a party of 7 at a large table. My parents (late 70's) were at the far end and couldn't here him. He only moved closer when I asked him to do so. When poring coffee, the waiter reached across me to pour a cup for the person next to me. They also never came back to fill our drinks until we flagged them down. No one was friendly or ever smiled.

Spectacular views of the city, great bean dip and chips, amazing service (these guys work hard for the money), fun atmosphere and of course, really delicious entrees.  If you go on the weekend they'll have a single musician jamming out hard on guitar or some keys and singing/playing along with some pre-recorded tracks. These guys are INTO it, so just sit back and enjoy them enjoying themselves.  Food-wise, I've had a lot of different items and they have all been good. Probably not the absolute greatest food I've ever had, but it's quite tasty and the prices are very reasonable.  As a whole package, this is one of our go-to spots and we always bring our out of towners here and they rave about it. Being on top of seemingly the largest hill in Henderson makes it a cool experience, so try to get a window seat and make sure to hang over the railing for a bit before you head off for the evening.",

We were OK with it. So we waited and waited. Our party had to wait for 35-40 min before we got our table. It was really frustating. After getting our table, our experience with the food was not any better. It took us around 45 min to get our food from the time we ordered and we just nibbled on the chips and salsa. No one came to ask if we needed more salsa or bean dip (our bean dip was empty). The chips were not freshly fried (not warm). Anyway, the food was just OK. I would not pay the price to go and eat there again. The food was just OK. The rice and beans tasted like out of a can. The only good thing about this place is the view of the strip.

We love the wait staff and had the pleasure of meeting the owner Javier. It's been 5 years now and I can't say there's ever been one bad experience here at the Henderson location.

Getting in there was tough because I had a stroller with my 9 month and EVERY server kept walking in my way instead of letting me take a seat they kept doing their thing until the manager yelled and waved for them to move. Everything was fine until the servers kept bumping into me and my son without with saying I'm sorry excuse me NOTHING out of the 9 times I got bumped into to 2 were apologized. The food was OKAY the beans and rice were cold but my enchiladas were good! Most of our orders were wrong but I'm glad I got Emily to take my order she got it right! When they started picking up plates etc they just grabbed the stuff without even asking without saying excuse me are you done with that or excuse me let me clear that up for you nothing! Before I forget I ordered a drink from Emily I got the drink within the next 1-2 mins Luis brings it out he's standing between a co-worker and I and he's asking who order the drink I'm wave to him I did! I repeated my self 3 times and called his name 2 times and still didn't notice I said the soda was mine until a serve called his name and looked my way I was so fed up after that. Would I return NO!",

And if you're fine with sloshing hot sauce on the main dish then you're probably not very picky about whether the meat tastes gamey or the tortillas greasy. Maybe we got unlucky, or maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I ate at the DI location about a decade ago and remember it tasting equally disappointing.  Servers were friendly and helpful, even while comping half of our meal; chips and bean dip were above average, but so too were all the prices. Water was clean tasting if you care about that sort of thing. View is fantastic. And I really disliked the food.  We would love to find just one meal here that works for our cursed picky-eater super-taster palates, so we'd have an excuse to come by and enjoy the view and friendly service. Who knows what it'll take to come back, though.",

Fajitas are such a simple dish to make delicious with a little thought and care.  As well as my daughters enchilada was cold when it hit the table.  I think the kitchen needs to be retrained and management needs to slow everything down, so people can relax enjoy themselves and hopefully enjoy some good Mexican fair.

    "text": "Out of all of the Michoacan-themed restaurants around the valley, I go to the La Loma Lindo location the most often since I live in Henderson. It's a solid bet when I feel like having some super delicious chicken -- I've had every chicken dish on their menu and found you can't go wrong with any of them. My favorites are the gallo al mojo de ajo, pollo sarandeado, and pollo al tomate. I'm a sauce fanatic, and the sauce on all three of these dishes is to die for! The carnitas are also pretty super, and tender enough to fall apart at the touch of your fork. The portions are enormous on almost all of these dishes -- every time, I can pretty much get 3 meals out of whatever I order, making it a fantastic deal for a moderately-priced restaurant.  Other things I like about this Lindo are the ease of getting a table (I've never made reservations and have never had to wait more than 10-15 mins for a table, even when they're super packed); all of the choices of margaritas (their skinny margarita is actually the closest most places come to offering an actual \"real\"/classic margarita); and the view, which is especially awesome after sunset. Service is also pretty decent and super quick most of the times I've gone. Also, if you call in a to-go order, they'll actually also give you the cup of fideo soup AND the beans/salsa and chips they'd give you if you were actually dining there, which most places definitely wouldn't do if you were ordering take-out.   Drawbacks are the noise (this location gets really loud to begin with, acoustically, but then one of the dudes playing keyboard & singing comes on and you can't even hear yourself think, much less hear your dinner companion speaking) and the beef dishes (I've tried a couple, and both times the meat was tough & not very flavorful, in spite of the other flavorful ingredients).  If you're in Henderson and you're looking for flavorful Mexican food that deviates from the standard burrito/taco/quesadilla offerings, you shouldn't be disappointed with this place.",

The service is also very wonderful.  I had the carnitas on the bone and it was fall off the bone moist and succulent.  The burrito is also super huge and can be enjoyed by 2 people!   We also had the Queso Fundedo con Choritzo for the app.  It was not the best I've ever had.  I would pass the next time.  When My wife was sick, I came her to get the Pollo soup and it was fabulous, hit the spot.    The only downfall is that is quite expensive for Mexican food.  Our dinner bill was around $80 (1 drink).  I always feel like Asian food and Mexican food should not be that expensive.   My humble opinon.  Other than that, if you are looking for great Mexican food, I'd recommend.",

We got there moments before the dinner crowd swarmed through the front door.  Another plus is they don't water down their margaritas like most other places do.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 solely because of the off-key singer in the live entertainment.",

They make it right at the table with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the fish tacos but the beef ranchero wasn't bad. You can always find a 15% off coupon. Great people and great service.",

    "text": "Love the food, and they have the best strawberry margaritas in the valley! But, the last two times my husband and I have made reservations we still ended up waiting 20 plus minutes to be seated which is super annoying. The whole point of making a reservation ahead is to not have to wait. The front host staff and their customer service could use some work! I was pretty annoyed having to wait with a scheduled reservation and they were not apologetic at all, after 15 minutes I asked for an update and one of the girls (didn't catch her name but she had very long dark hair) rolled her eyes at me and seemed bothered I was asking. They seem super unorganized. Also, the parking is a pain. You almost always have to wait for a spot because there is maybe 20 spots max in their lot and the restaurant is huge.",

I've been here on days with an hour wait, but I came yesterday and was seated instantly.   Their service is stellar. Our waiter wasn't very friendly, however he was on top of his game. You're never out of chips / dip / drinks.   Decent selection of beer. Good selection of margaritas and house drinks. They're in the process of redoing their drink menu as well.  FYI their drinks are STRONG. It's not necessarily a bad thing since i'd rather have too strong of a drink than a watered down one.   Food is pretty good, kinda depends on what you order. Their speciality dishes are more expensive but taste better in my opinion; I don't really recommend their lunch specials.  Guacamole is made right in front of you and it's bomb.   I would come again for sure, however there are some competitors out there that give Lindo a run for their money",

I was worried were coming in half an hour before closing that the staff would be weary and that the kitchen was closed, but the hostess was enthusiastic and we were seated right away. The restaurant is quite big and decorated tastefully with rustic decor without being cheesy.   Complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip came out first. It was ok. I had the carne asada nachos, fajita steak burrito, and chicken quesadilla. The chips in the carne asada nacho was a little greasy, but the meat itself was good. The portions we're big, well seasoned, not salty, and the service was attentive. This is a good place to have dinner dates or get togethers with friends and family since the city view makes a nice backdrop. I would definetly come back to try out their drinks and try their other specialities.",

I thought the whole point to make reservations is so you didn't have to wait and the tables would already have been set for us. no one apologized for anything and not even a manager stopped by to ask how we were doing. every other time I go there with my family of 5, there's always a manager asking if everything was going well. pretty upsetting for me and unsure if I would return myself.",

Bean dip was missing something, Needed like a lil seasoning mixed otherwise it was just refried beans with added water to make it like a dip. I will give Lindo another chance to try and redeem all the good things I've heard about them. The Fideo soup is something special. Flavor was great, tastes great.

Really large spacious restaurant with Gorgeous Views everywhere you sit. Really large expansive menu with so many items to choose from. Almost half the items I've never heard of before, it was truly authentic. This would be great for couples and large groups because it was so spacious inside.   We ordered shrimp and fish tacos and chili verde. My mom loves Chili Verde and commented it was the best she's had, large portions and the sauce was really flavourful.  The fish and shrimp tacos came with (3) each and rice and beans. It was a generous portion and exactly what I was in the mood for. Service was efficient and friendly. I saw them making Guacamole fresh tableside I'd definitely try that next time.  Great Mexican restaurant I would go again;)",

She said we can seat you right now.  I was like OK!, let's do this...   we sat down and immediately had our drink order taken and had our food order soon after.  We got chips and salsa, followed by some amazing soups and then we all got different combo plates.  Mine was chili releno, chicken taco and a beef burrito w/beens and rice.  Everything was perfect and it came with a side of roasted jalapenos.   PERFECT",

    "text": "First off, the view is incredible here.  You can see the entire valley from the windows.  So pretty at night with lights.  Called to make a reservation but was told you needed to call at least two hours ahead for such (wasn't aware of this). So name was put on a waitlist. When we got there the place was packed, and I mean packed. Our wait time was a little less in 20 minutes for a table. Overall it was OK. They serve you chips, salsa, and a really good being dip when you sit down. The bean dip was so delicious. But come to find out I think it was actually the same refried beans that were on the dish with the meal. Almost every meal came with a cup of fideo, which is basically a tomato noodle soup. It was quite tasty. I would not order the flautas again, as they were so incredibly dry. I even tried peeling off the tortilla to just eat the chicken, and I absolutely could not eat my meal. I ended up returning my meal which they ended up comping on the bill. I would definitely try it again as the others in my party enjoyed their meals. I would just pick something different to eat. Our waiter was OK, he didn't come by to check on our meals, however, the manager checked towards the end of our meal and that's who I spoke to about my dish. We sat near the bar and near a bell that they kept ringing every five or so minutes. It was quite frustrating to hear the bell go off so often and so loudly. Also because of the noise in the restaurant and the music playing everyone was yelling at each other and birthday songs were quite loud as well",

We ordered the mango cake for dessert which was really tasty.  Thanks, we will of course return!",

What's good:  The view: especially at night  Drinks: a ton options with Mexican variations Price: given the amount of food/portion size Food: fish tacos, ceviche, table side guacamole  Birthday special: you get a free shot of tequila  What's ok:  Service: hit or miss. Of the few times that I've been here, it's been mostly good but there have been times where the server forgets to place our cocktail order. Really depends on how busy they are.  The not so good:  Parking: when its packed, parking can get a little tough. Wish they offered valet on the weekends.   Overall, it's a great meal and an enjoyable experience. Worth a try!",

My mother loved eating here and we would take her every year for her birthday and a few other times a year. Since she died 2 years ago, my brother, my sister and I have been coming for her birthday, setting up her picture, and ordering her a Chile relleno, and a tequila shot. Of course, she never is actually there to eat with us, it's just for us to celebrate her life (cue the Coco music, no tears, only tasty adult beverages and laughing please). Tonight Manny waited on us.   Now Manny has waited on myself and my husband and my family in the past and he always a good waiter, but tonight he was stellar. He looked at her picture and told us he thought he remembered our mom (maybe he did, maybe he didn't but he made us happy to think that someone else remembered her), and he brought us the tequila, her meal, told us all to enjoy, and checked on us frequently with a big smile on his face. He even asks us if we wanted any dessert. I'm pretty sure if we were crazy enough to ask he would've had the owner singing happy birthday to an empty chair.   Manny gets a 5 star review. We love Lindo, we have always come here, and we will continue to come here. Thank you Manny!",

Their service is decent and staff who've catered our table were friendly. The restaurant here is spacious but just crowded lol, so make your reservations early or call to find out when's a good time to come. You also can't miss the restaurant as it sits on top of a hill and it's bright orange lol-- good way to spot it.   I say try it once and if you like it, then return with your family and or friends!",

    "text": "Love visiting my dad in Vegas and having him take me on food adventures off the strip! This time around we had dinner at Lindo Michoacan. If you're from out of town and you have your own car and love Mexican food, this is the place to go. It's about a 20-30 min drive off the strip. The restaurant sits on top of hill so if you sit at the bar or behind the bar, you get an amazing view of Las Vegas and the strip! Food was great, service was great, and I look forward to returning with my friends to show them this spot!",

    "text": "I've been here more times than I can recall, since my fiance and I frequent this spot with his family for birthdays, Mother's Day, and Father's Day yearly, and with their large menu, I'm never bored.  I've also had the opportunity to sit in different areas of the restaurant, my favorite being near the windows and wonderful view of the valley. The service has also always been wonderful. Prompt refills of beverages and the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip! The food arrives quickly too. General manager, Gerardo is extremely kind and so accommodating. I've made reservations with him and he comes through with the best table in the house for our special occasions!  The food is where I'm a bit torn. I've had really good dishes and I've had \"shrug-worthy\" dishes. Like I said, I'm never bored - it's always an adventure to try another dish and not knowing how good it'll be with just the short menu description. Primarily, the dishes lack proper seasoning (a little salt can go a long way people!) and that takes away from the complex flavors. However, the dishes that I've enjoyed had developed the flavors completely and thus, were very memorable.  One dish I have really enjoyed was the POLLO en PIPIAN. A juicy chicken breast filet served with a delicious Aztec mole (sauce). The flavors in the sauce are deep and just create a different experience for your chicken. Lately, I've been gravitating toward the \"Especialidades del Mar\" (specifically the shrimp) section and I'm glad I made the leap! They use large Mexican Gulf shrimp and it is always prepared perfectly! Fresh, juicy, succulent, with a nice bite. I really enjoyed this preparation in the CHILES RELLENOS de CAMARON where the shrimp was sauteed in olive oil, white wine, onions, tomato, cilantro, and jalapeno. A big heap was then placed on top of two roasted pasilla chiles, then topped with cheese. Delicious!!   My fiance and I always order completely different dishes, which is wonderful since I get to try things I wouldn't think of ordering and it normally turns out that his selection is more tasty than mine! I like to think that this is because he's not as concerned about ordering healthy dishes as I am, not because he's a better \"orderer\" lol. Anyway, I can't remember his dishes (not does he), but there were several we have both really liked! Essentially, we don't order the typical Mexican-American fare of burritos, nachos, enchiladas, or fajitas. I did order their Chimichanga once and that was a mistake. Perhaps these items are not their strong points? Either way, I like the specialities with moles or diabla sauces, meats sauteed in olive oil, lemon, and white wine, rather than slathered in cheese.  Overall, I always have great dining experiences here. I never have to worry about long waits, lacking service, or really bad food. I am torn between three and four stars since my food experience is inconsistent, but my likelihood to return is very high, thus four stars.  BTW, they are extremely busy on holidays!! I suggest making a reservation, if possible, or expecting a little wait (it's never been long). Also, the parking lot across Carnegie has been opened for restaurant patrons, so you don't have to resort to parking on the hilly street (which we have had to do many times in the past).",

While waiting we ordered margaritas, muy Bueno! Once seated we were in the front of the dining room with a great view of Las Vegas. I think LM has one of the better views of town.  As usual I ordered the Ensalada Marinara which was spot on, ripe avocados, plenty of shrimp and pico de gallo! The rest of the group ordered fish tacos, a very large portion. A burrito and quesadilla for the girls. All very tasty and excellent service.  If you have a craving for Mexican food with a view, this is the place.",

I am finally writing a review after enjoying Lindo more than one occasion, because I really wanted to love their food, and tried at least 3 different things (Camarones a la diabla, pork carnitas, and tacos over my 3 occassions) and sadly, every time their food is bland and meh. My husband can't even finish a plate here which says something, LOL.... if we are going out to eat someplace like this, we will darn sure eat what we pay for. Finally we told the server, who was great and brought the manager over, who discounted our ticket (which we did not ask for, so that was unexpected). But overall, when you dine out and want to pay their prices, you expect much more.   I really hope that they step up their game! Drinks & a view, go here to just enjoy the ambiance but don't expect outstanding food. (sorry Lindo)",

    "text": "This regards the Henderson, Nevada location. Yes, as good as it gets. The glowing reviews are spot on. Make a reservation and plan a few extra minutes for parking- plenty up and down the street if the lot is full.  We had a group of 13 for a special occasion on a Sunday evening. We made our reservation weeks in advance, but finished at the graduation earlier than expected- I called and they said come on in- an hour earlier than we had arranged. They had a beautiful table setup next to a large window- wow. The service was impeccable, even though the restaurant was obviously full to capacity, though not so loud that we couldn't carry on good conversation. Enthusiastic, always present, cheerful, helped by others as needed. What a treat! Had our drinks out in no time, delicious soup for all, and helped patiently take 13 dinner orders, delivered surprisingly quickly, fresh, hot, delicious, just as ordered. The waiter (Erick) checked on us regularly, kept chips, salsa water and margarita glasses full throughout. They even festively serenaded the graduate! Everybody had a wonderful time, all at a fair price. So appreciative of this great spot, obviously well managed, with happy and efficient employees, nice \"small touches\" and spectacular views. Absolutely worth the drive, recommended!!",

Once the food hit the table I understood completely the wait with everything being fresh. The bussers never let my drink get empty and our server Jesus was extremly atentive. Ive been in the service industy for 10 years now and its been a while since a restaurant has left me talking about it hours after ive walked out the doors but this place was amazing.",

The first time I really liked it, but the second time I went on a Friday night and it was pretty loud. A really nice Mariachi band played during our whole dinner and it was quite loud. I was taking my teenage niece out to eat so that we could connect and catch up. It's already hard enough to compete with her phone and her being a teenager. I had a hard time hearing her or talking over the music. Not sure if this is a just a weekend thing or what. The music is good, but it's just a little loud for my preference. My niece thought the fajita burito was really good. I ordered the carna asada tacos (subbing one with beef shoulder) and it was ok. I've had better. Dinner for two was about $35. I will probably try this place again, but I'd avoid weekends.",

Only cons is that it's a pretty popular place for dinner and you might not be able to find parking at all, go early!",

    "text": "Came in late into LV and was craving Mexican food.   Lindo Michoacan has fairly authentic casual Mexican food, some of the better I have had in a long long time.   Having been all over Mexico several times and specifically the opportunity to eat my way through Mexico City, I am generally very picky when it comes to Mexican food.   We had the fresh guacamole, shrimp ceviche, tacos al pastor, and two tostadas chicken and chorizo.   The guacamole was outstanding. Great balance of lime juice, spice, and onions with a perfect consistency.   Tacos al pastor were also very good although not the most authentic I've had (close though). The pastor meat though was particularly delicious I was just not a fan of the way they used the pineapple (one big slice instead of shreds).   Tostadas were probably the least impressive but by no means bad.   All in all I highly recommend the place. Food is fresh and delicious with clearly high quality ingredients. To boot it's reasonably priced (for the quantity).",

Very attentive staff and amazing atmosphere. The view at this location is spectacular. If you are planning on a date night, you can call and make reservation. A great view of the valley. It is worth the drive from mountains edge. They had live music on Friday. Very good place. My husband did good by bringing me here. Real authentic cooks! Love this place!! P.S. The only bad thing is when you leave, the smokers congregate and smoke right in front of the restaurant entrance. So gross for someone who loathes the smell of cigarettes .",

    "text": "\" Massive Menu, Great Food, Awesome View ! \"\"  My wife and I were invited by some friends of ours to visit the Lindo Michocan Mexican Restaurant in Henderson, Nevada for dinner. What a place!. The Menu is massive. It will take you some time to read through it, and decide what you are going to have for dinner from their gourmet Mexican cuisine. I had one of the best Chili Relleno's and Cheese Enchiladas I have ever had. My wife had the Carnitas, which were also delicious. Our friends both had the Mojarra ( Tilapia ) which was huge, and look fantastic. The view the restaurant has especially at night over looking the entire city of Las Vegas, is Fantastic ! The restaurant hand makes their own fresh tortillas, and has live entertainment playing great Mexican music while you eat. We would difenitely go back to te Lindo Michocan again !

    "text": "Service was seriously lacking on my visit to Leave Lindo. I have been wanting to try since it opened and I was disappointed in the service and the food. I was excited because this place has one of the best views in town and because I love Mexican food. A friend's birthday is what brought us to this restaurant.   We had a reservation for 13 people. We showed up on time and we're still waiting to be seated. The waiting area was packed and most of my party had to stand directly in front of someone that was seated, butt to their face. I also had to keep moving so the servers could get by since the waiting area is blocking the exit for the kitchen. Staff seemed over whelmed with the amount of people. I was overwhelmed with the amount of people.  After being seated we received glasses of water, chips, salsa, & beans. The table was so small that it didn't really have enough room to put food in the middle. I know I am a large man but I also did not feel I had a comfortable amount of room to be seated for dinner.   Hot delicious beans made me happy. The chips were amazing. Continuously being refilled with fresh chips that were hot and fresh which in the end was confusing because this wasn't the same for my meal    It was about 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. Drinks came quickly. About another 20 minutes before the order was taken. I believe our chips were refilled 3 times before we had our order taken. Everyone was getting stuffed on chips. They were honestly perfect.   When the food came I was very excited. I loved the presentation of the nacho appetizer I order as an entire plus carne asada. The person seated next to me order the exact same thing. As she took a bite I commented on the presentation and how nice it was. She commented on how the chips were burned and the steak was flavorless.   I began to grab for a chip. These chips were not the same ones from the table. I don't think they were made from the same tortilla either. They were like fat uncrispy wedges. When I put it in my mouth I could taste what tasted like burnt oil. The first thought in my mind was OMG the bright me a plate of chips that were fried then refried to heat them up. The taste of extra oil was apparent.   I almost didn't believe that the steak could be flavorless. It was. I felt like I was being punished for ordering an appetizer as an entree. When the server came by I made my first food complaint of my life and it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I am upset I didn't complain more after my experience.   I told the server the issue with our plates. He quickly grabbed the food and said I'll get a manager. The manager asked us if we wanted anything else? The truth of the matter is that I wanted the nachos on the fresh hot chips they had kept bringing to the table, not the ones they had reheated for my entree. He said ok and that was that. They removed it from the bill with out saying anything.   I feel like the manager could have made some type of attempt of apologizing. I sat there for over an hour before food was brought to the table. Quickness wasn't the impression that was left by Lindos service so the real reason I didn't order anything else was because by the time the food comes in afraid everyone else would be finished.   We also had a friend at the table with cold fries. There was obviously a problem in the kitchen tonight. Just wish I could have had a great experience here. The prices weren't outrageous but they wee higher than going to a taco shop where you can get quality food and quick service.",

I have lived in 3 states and I can honestly say this may be the best Mexican food I have ever had!   First night we had 2 frozen margaritas, one regular, one Cadillac both amazing! Then I had the fried tilapia (HUGE! And delicious!) and he had the steak rancheros....I would NEVER expect their New York steak to be as tender and flavorful as it was..OMG! I ate half of his steak and we took half the fish home! Wow! Then we had the fried ice cream with bananas and fire rum...VERY alcohol flavored. Id probably go with something a bit less next time. But still great! Our server and backwaiter were both very attentive and amazing!   Tonight it was so busy so we sat at the bar while waiting. Had a mojito and pina Bonita which was sweet but STRONG! Tipsy before hitting the table! The bartenders were slammed but still so sweet and helpful! Then I had a skinny marg on the rocks (fresh lime juice instead of sweet and sour) and let's just say I couldn't drive home! Had the steak cognac with mushrooms for him with the NY steak again and I had the bone in ribeye with cilantro lime sauce. Omg both were so tender and amazing! Cooked perfectly to a med rare and SOOOO huge and delicious! Service was great again from the management to the server and backwaiter along with the bartenders.   We both work in very nice fine dining and steak houses in the Venetian on the strip and know good food, service and atmosphere....this place has it!   I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for its drinks, food, service and VIEW of this strip/city!! We live down the street and have found our regular spot!",

Our sodas never got lower than half empty before they were being filled back up, without us asking.  And the food. There were 6 of us, ordered 6 different types of dinner, and they were all delicious. Everyone said that their food was really good. If I had to find something to complain about, I guess it would be that it was pretty noisy in there....so don't go expecting a quiet dinner!

One friend's enchiladas showed up at the table plain with no sauce. She had to ask the waiter for the sauce.  Another friend's plate came without rice that was listed on the menu. The rice never came even after she asked the server.  I am done listing the negatives. The view from the restaurant is great if you don't mind bland food or pay for food you don't get.

Off to a bad start when one of our party got a glass of ice water spilled on him, soaking his shirt, pants and spilling into his wife's purse (which was sitting between them).  I suggested that deserved a free drink - but nothing was offered.  When the food arrived - all six meals, nothing was hot. Five of the means were only slightly warm.  My husband had a shrimp dish and the sauce on it was almost offensive as it didn't lend itself to seafood, so he just scraped it off.  Because it was so noisy we just wanted to finish our meals and leave, not wanting to wait for anything to be reheated.

    "text": "Menu items tried: Lobster & Steak, Carne asada salad, alma tequila flight  Pros: atmosphere, service, scenary (mountaintop view of the city), New York strip steak was perfectly cooked medium, I tried the cognac sauce on the side (mushroom, onion, sweet taste that reminded me of a Thai coconut sauce), tequila flight, garlic sauce on the side for the lobster (similar to shrimp scampi seasoning) Cons: carne asada salad was prepared better at the Desert Inn Lindo's location. The  carne asada was not seared on the outside at the Henderson location, the lobster was over cooked (very rubbery texture and required a knife to sample) I sent the lobster back to the kitchen with the message that it was over cooked and they cooked the replacement the exact same way.  The Desert Inn location is my preference.  I will definitely try the Henderson location again for the view and atmosphere, but avoid the lobster.",

This is an American version of Mexican food and not a very good one. I have no idea who voted this place best Mexican Restaurant but they must have a lack of taste buds. The server German was about the most uniformed and no caring server  on the face of the planet, I kept asking him if things were gluten free, he said he would ask then came back to me and first thought gluten was the same as cheese, then thought that it was avocado. I had to take my chances and order at my own risk. The carnitas was dry and void of flavor, and the fajitas were yucky too. Rice and bean were the worst I ever had, the salsa was bland as hell and the chips were flavorless.",

The view is great, especially as the sun starts to set and the strip lights can be seen in off in the distance.  The wait staff were all friendly and the service was wonderful!  The food was also good, there were so many things to choose from, and not enough room in my stomach to possibly try all of them.  I would definately come back here to try out other things on the menu.",

    "text": "I don't usually dig Mexican food so I wasn't too thrilled when my husband suggested we give this place a try. He was suckered in by the large glass windows and the restaurant's location, perched high atop a mountain overlooking the Vegas valley. (The view did NOT disappoint, by the way! It's a great place to take out of town visitors to impress them with a stunning view).   The restaurant is large and spacious. The hostess was super friendly, and you walk in right by the open kitchen. The menu is large with all sorts of interesting and creative dishes (I got a chicken breast cooked with sweet peppers and topped with cream and it was amazingly tasty). I also asked if I could have veggies instead of rice and beans and they said no problem and were very accommodating! All dinners come with freshly made flour tortillas (sooooo yummy), rice & beans (or a vegetable medly of mushrooms, onions, zucchini and peppers if you ask), and a pretty dang good cup of soup (tomato broth with noodles). Another big plus is that they serve Pepsi products. Nothing's better than a fizzy Diet Pepsi on a hot day!  The complimentary corn chips, salsa and bean dip were nothing to write home about, but we managed to gobble down almost the entire basket. The food really is \"Mexican gourmet\" as advertised. The ingredients tasted fresh and the options inspired. There are also standard items for picky eaters (tacos, quesadillas, fajitas).   The best thing about this place is the service! We had TOP NOTCH service, better service than we have had in some of the fancy places in town! I kid you not. We never had to ask for anything or needed anything. It was amazing. The service here is something that really surprised me but it will keep me going back!",

But look no further because you have arrived!  There's nothing bad to say about this establishment. I enjoyed the food which consisted of Enchiladas, rice and beans. A bit costly to have in a weekly base - bi-monthly is more feasible.  For a True Mexican experience, I recommend having the mariachi play a couple of traditional Mexican corridos (powerful narratives/ballads). For a Truer Mexican experience, I recommend 3+ shots of tequila. For a Truer-er Mexican experience, I recommend making friends with a Mexican and have his/her grandma cook for you.",

If you're going to call attention to something, at least make an attempt at adding flavor to the heat.

But the  Funny thing is i found is they are owned by the same family. The restaurant is very big with a great view of the city. That's the only reason i gave it 4 stars its too big and loud. But both are great choices. How can you go wrong with chips salsa and free fido soup!?!?!",

I went with my brother and my one year old niece, and the staff was incredibly attentive and made sure we were taken care of. We sat by the windows and had a beautiful view of the city, including the strip. I tend to make assumptions about how the food will be based on the salsa they start you off with and the salsa here was really good. The mango margarita was so close to heaven. I was happy with the variety of dishes they offered and ended up ordering the shrimp stuffed chiles rellenos. I really want to highlight how amazing the staff was though. They all worked as a team and made our visit very pleasant.",

    "text": "We were introduced to this awesome restaurant by family when we visited from out of town. Let me start by saying this place was mega crowded. Luckily my soon to be sis in law knew to call ahead and get our name on the list. We had to park on the Main Street as the whole lot was packed.  Loved the appetizer chips and salsa with warm bean dip too. Oh man! The salsa was spicy but amazing.  Entrees are served with rice and beans as well as a cup of soup. The cup of soup was tomato based with tiny noodles in it. Nothing special to me; but hubs liked it enough to finish his small bowl. But not interested in ours.  I ordered flautas (flour tortilla) and hubs got carne asada tacos. All the food was great. Pretty sure tortillas made on site. Kids liked their food too. Bro and sis got margaritas; they raved about them.  Service was AWESOME. Continually had water refills and Arnold palmer refills as needed. Chips and salsa refilled w/o us asking. Just very attentive and kind. The server was awesome as he chimed in on his recommendations of food w/o being pushy.  Live entertainment was decent too. Guy is the regular I hear. But he played his guitar and sang. They even sang my daughter HB and she got to wear the honorary sombrero. All good.  Prices were ok. $12-16 a plate on average. Not too bad. $95 for 6 people with a few adult drinks on the tab. I'd say this is pretty reasonable.  Last tip: sit by the window! The VIEW at night is fantastic. City lights twinkling with the strip lights from afar.",

    "text": "Man how I have wanted to try here SO bad. You see the brightly orange color building right off Horizon Ridge and then read wonderful reviews, my hopes were SO high!  It's a holiday, so I get it's busy. I get staff is tired and working hard. The gal setting our party of 3 was pleasant and suggested a great table. VIEW WAS BEAUTIFUL!  You could see the full strip and all its beauty!  Lunch is Mon- Friday till 5!! Sweet! How great is that! We all found plenty of food choices from the 3 lunch price tiers. It was a little difficult to figure out anything but the basics at every Mexican restaurant but help from google of a few words we could figure out everything just fine.  Waiter was horrid. It was over 20 mins before he greeted us then he took others orders before us and even coming back. People who came and were seated after we ordered got their food before us! Shrimp was cold, beans, rice, steak alllll cold. I had hair like things on my steak and my daughter had something non edible possibly plastic or some other material in her food. Before ordering I asked what was on the plate. He didn't say any vegetables and left out the fact of a extremely hot larger pepper that was all over the steak. This made it unable to eat for me for I can't do spicy like that. As I write this at home my lips are still numb and burning.  A positive is omg wonderful bus boy. Our chips were non stop filled and our drinks never empty. He didn't speak English well but he was able to get what we needed or asked someone to help him! I wish we could of just tipped him! I'm honestly sad I didn't get his name but I did post my receipt and in hopes staff will acknowledge him and his kind efforts. Bean dip was so good. Could of lived off just that!  If this was my only chance to visit I would of seen this as a fail to vegas eats! Maybe I'll see about a non holiday try but it's hard to look past the dirty wicker baskets they place on your bowl of chips that holds your tortillas (I couldn't even use them after seeing the grossness) then again the hair and plastic we ended up not eating most of the 3 meals ordered and what we did was carefully picked thu and still praying it will be ok.  Did stop and talk to a manager and all that was said was why didn't we ask for him? Well you see sir- your waiter wasn't around to do his job let alone for me to ask for you- I however tracked you down to inform you of his piss poor service.",

I made reservations for 8:30... got in early at 8 to wait for the table since we had family meeting with us. Everyone one was hangry so we thought we might get seated sooner. WRONG. It was just shy of 9:45 when they finally called us. So my experience wasn't as good as it could have been but I'm willing to give it another try.  Enjoy the live music!",

This review is for the \"far exceeded my expectations.\" I've eaten at Lindo's a dozen of times and while the food is excellent I've never had service this good. Our server was Angel and he was amazing. He struck the perfect balance of asking us if we wanted more drinks while not interrupting the conversation. This might seem insignificant to some but honestly it is a skill set I wish more servers could master. We were even the pain in the ass customers that asked to switch tables for a better view after being seated but this didn't bother him at all. Angel was so attentive that he realized we were celebrating a friends engagement. Our friends were surprisingly greeted with tequila shots, sombreros, and a delicious desert out of nowhere. Due to Angels ability of asking us if we wanted another round of drinks without interrupting the conversation, a bill that would've been $150 turned into $300. Well worth it. Overall it was a great night and Angel if you're reading this - thank you!",

Beyond salty!! I did not eat my food, my sis did because she's preggos and was starving. The service was horrible the only person that actually helped us was the drink runner (Maximo) who I tipped and the only one that offered to remove both dinner plates off of the bill. I said no just mine because my sis ate all of hers. He apologized and not once did I see the waiter. I went to pay and the hostess asked me how my food/ service was, I said the WORST EVER! She apologized and was going to call the manager but I said no, paid and left. I get that they have to get ppl in & out but seriously horrid!!! I will not be returning!!!",

It's even better than our beloved Frank & Fina's in Summerlin. The food is amazzinnggg. I have nothing else to say except to be sure to order the guacamole. The servers bring the ingredients to your table and make the guacamole right in front of you so it's fresh. You can also choose to have the flavor taste mild, medium, or hot. Also, try to come early or request a table with a Strip view. The far side of the restaurant behind the bar has a stunning view of the Strip. Definitely recommend to anyone in the mood for great, authentic Mexican food.",

I definitely have to broaden my experience in what delicious authentic Mexican dishes are supposed to taste like. However, it didn't stop me from enjoying my lunch here.  The staff was very friendly and patient. I asked our bartender what chicken dish she'd recommend for me. She named a few and I ordered the Trece (Pollo al Mojo de Ajo) and my boyfriend ordered Veintidos (Tacos de Camaron). Their lunch specials are definitely a good deal, ranging from $8.50 to $11.50, including a beverage, refill, rice beans, and tortillas. Our chips, salsa, and bean dip arrived immediately, and now I can see why people loved the salsa. I loved their flour tortillas, too.  We're wanting to come back for Cinco de Mayo, but wondering if we can brave the crowd, I'm sure it'll be packed. I almost forgot to say what an amazing view the restaurant had!   I'd definitely come back for their food and service, it was great. Next time, I'll order dessert...fried ice cream....yum.",

    "text": "Not sure where to eat, we looked online and did some culinary reconaissance.  Someone suggested Mexican, and not knowing anywhere off the top of our heads, we went to our apps and started our search.  We honed in on Lindo Michoacan, a place on top of a hill that has sweeping views of the Strip.  We pass by it all the time, (I actually have gone there before when it was an Italian place and remember the view) looked at the menu online and away we went!!  On a Friday night, the parking lot was packed like a tailgate party at a Mizzou game!  Unsure as to how this would pan out, I jumped out of the car and ran inside to scope the joint.  Inside was an unexpected mob scene; loud and crowded with a huge waiting area full of people, I squeezed my way over to the Hostess stand and asked the wait time.  She replied 25 minutes, (which means add at least 15 onto that) so I darted back out and gave them the news.  They agreed to wait and parked the car, (apparently the cut off time was 45min.). Let the journey begin!  Needless to say we were floored.....the large, festive and ethnic interior, the effervescent if not rowdy friday throng of families, it was a barnyard full of diners, workers and food!  Even with the long lines of people, the wait was actually bearable; guests were cycling in and out of the restaurant and this place worked like a machine-good going operations!!!  What was very surprising was how Lindo Michoacan was successful as a Mexican establishment - the interior and waitstaffs' uniforms were hard-core ethnic considering its located in a land of suburban national chain restaurants.  With a full Mariachi band off to side, (horns and guitars) it added to the festive ambiance.  You couldn't be in a bad mood here!  And within the wait time stated, the hostess seated us in a room off of the main barnyard next to the windows with panoramic views of the strip. The waitstaff immediately brought us chips with bean dip and salsa and took our drink order.  The table had Cadillac Margaritas (with Grand Marnier) and beers and we decided to order the fresh guacamole.   I will say, it is an incredibly smart move to bring the chips and salsa to the table; it immediately satiates the customer if they are hungry or irritated and it helps with flow of drinking.  Getting the guacamole was the best idea ever...really fresh and light, it complimented, not overpowered our appetites and the proportions were just right; just a small bowl so as not to fill us up before our meal.  Rick ordered the Carnitas: Pork marinated with Oranges and then slow cooked until tender.  Apparently Michoacan is known for its Carnitas and served with Chiles, Green sauce and Guacamole, it was an excellent dish! Rick ate both Chiles and didn't burn his mouth....  Quote:  \"I don't what the green sauce was, but I sure did dip my meat in it!\" - Rick  Marian ordered the Enchilda Terasca; filled with cheese, beef and chicken, it was on the smaller, lighter side out of all of our dishes.  I will say, in most restaurants, there are mounds and mounds of beans and rice which is not entirely my favorite combination.  But at Lindo, they have the proportions down well; they serve smaller portions of the carbs so you're not bloated and overstuffed.  The ingredients were fresh so the sides didn't have that, 'I've been sitting her in a pot all day taste' and she was very satisfied!  Rick Sr. ordered his all time favorite Mexican dish: Chile Verde Marrano,  chunks of Pork simmered in Green Salsa, with Tomatillos, Green Peppers, Onions, Cilantro and Fresh Garlic.   His overall comments were that it was very flavorful, but usually the dish he orders had the meat stewed for long periods of time so its broken down into the sauce where this dish was more chunky.  So Alan ordered ordered the Pollo con Rajas y Cremas Estilo Stephania, grilled Chicken Breasts sauteed in Olive Oil with Onions, Parsilla strips in a cream sauce.  Alan had a hard time trying to decide what to order, on the the one hand he wanted to try the more traditional Mexican dishes like the Mole, but he was allured by the other more contemporary entrees, like the Gallo al Cognac.  Ultimately, the Pollo Rajas y Crema was a great choice; the creaminess of the sauce with the chicken hit the spot!  During our dining experience, the Mariachi band and a handful of singers walked around the restaurant and ultimately to our table, and we were just elated and thoroughly entertained! And although some may say it is a little cheesy and pandering to our perception of Mexican culture,  all we can say is that we had a truly enjoyable time- and in the end of our culinary experience it came down to our dining company complimenting the ambience and cuisine; with memories of a fun time with family!!",

Here's why:  Although the beans & salsa served before the meal are awesome (could make a whole meal out of them!), I end up disappointed in my entree, no matter what I get. I couldn't put my finger on the reason for the disappointment until I read some other reviews: the food is just bland. It's not an under-salting issue; the sauces and meats, as well as the rice and beans (whyyyy can't they just put the appetizer beans with the entrees?). It's just blah. Also, considerably less spicy than I like, with no salsa at the table to heat things up. For the record, I can barely handle a jalepeno.   All I want from Lindo's is to have a flavor jump out at me. Currently, what I get is a mass of bland that needs to be washed down with a drink.   Also, if you find EXTREMELY LOUD mariachi music as obnoxious as I do (it has got to be more than just me!), skip this place or ask to be seated in the room with the view.",

All times I was fortunate enough to be seated by the windows to see the great view of the strip.  My most recent visit was only about an hour ago and the food as always was delicious.  Our server extremely busy with a large party but did a great job at making sure that we were well taken care of.    Not long of a wait. Excellent customer service Delicious food prices are a little higher than other Mexican restaurants, however I've never had this great of service at any of the others.  Well worth the price.  Overall 5 stars",

The waitstaff, with the exception of a couple waiters, is poor at best. They messed something up on our order the last 4 times we went. The manager is unapologetic, and always had some lame excuse. Also, not that he has to, but if I managed a restaurant and saw a couple come in week in and week out, I'd buy them a drink every so often. Never once happened. The other Place, Viva Michoacan near Sunset and Sunset is way better. Worth the drive when I could walk to Lindo.  update:  we we t back, and the food and service has been remarkably better. Good job, Lindo!!  4 stars.",

The sopitas were so filling, that I could only get through one flauta! I ate the rest the next day for lunch and they were still yummy. Make sure to come here hungry! I couldn't even imagine getting dessert, I was so full, but I did allow myself a glass of horchata, which didn't disappoint! Great food and great service!",

That says something about this place so we decided to go head and wait and praying the food is worth it. The view though is spectacular! The food is good. I don't usually eat beans but they served the chips with a side of salsa and beans and they were delicious. I ordered the shrimp fajitas and it was also delicious. My husband ordered a beef fajitas and the meat came out dry. Other than that, the rest of the food was good. The service was okay. I felt like we were being rushed maybe because the place was packed. Our waiter came occasionally to ask if everything was ok but everytime, before we answered he was already walking away. He didn't seem to care but at least we enjoyed our dinner. We might go back for lunch next time hoping it won't be too packed and get a better service and not so dry meat. Maybe then I'll give this place a 5 star.",

I've never had a bad experience here. Their table side guacamole is bomb! Love love love how fresh it is. I usually order combination dishes so I can try a couple items but I've had their traditional dishes, particularly their chicken mole enchiladas, and a chicken dish sauteed in oil, garlic, and white wine with peppers. It's always delicious!  Fried ice cream is also a favorite, but our server Angel heard my boyfriend say, get a dessert, it's your birthday! Shortly after, I was wearing a huge sombrero with 3 churros in front of me, and a shot of tequila was slammed on the table for me to drink! Love this place! Angel is a gem! Don't lose him!",

    "text": "I usually don't like to pay for fancy Mexican food when I'm perfectly content with a fix from Roberto's or Amigos Tacos. But my experience at Lindo Michoacan made it all worth it.  I went with a party of ten (including two babies) and was seated promptly since we had a reservation. We were hoping to get seated where they have an amazing view of the valley but that wasn't available.  They were quick to bring warm chips, salsa and bean dip. You can seriously get full just from the chips. The servers continuously refilled our chips to ensure they were warm for us.Try the fresh guacamole! It is made table side so you know it can't get any fresher.  I ordered their shrimp enchiladas (over $18) and although it was good, I felt it was overpriced. Good thing I filled up on chips and their complimentary fideo soup.  I give this place 4 stars because of their excellent service. Our water was never less than 3/4 full. We were checked on regularly. And even though some people in our party came late and we ended up being there for three hours, we never felt rushed.  They have a live band which adds to the fun ambiance. I prefer restaurants where I don't have to yell to talk to the person next to me, but just know that's what to expect here on a Friday night.  Kudos to the staff at Lindo Michoacan for your attentive service!",

Since we've moved out here we have been on the hunt for decent Mexican food in Las Vegas. My friend Lacey introduced me to Lindo Michoacan in Henderson location. I so impressed with the beautiful setting over looking the Las Vegas skyline. I've been to the Henderson location a few times and every time I have such a great experience. The food was amazing!!! I enjoyed the \"Gallo al Chipotle Estilo\" and the freshly made Guacamole. They have live music, freshly maid tortillas, the Henderson location has the best night view of Las Vegas and how can you beat fresh Guacamole!!!!!??!?!?? Great costumer service, great food, great ambiance, hands down my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This review is actually based on my second experience here at Lindo Michoacan.   If you are looking for a smashing view of the entire Las Vegas valley and you don't want to spend $$$$$ at the Stratosphere, this is your best bet! However, if you are looking for fantastic Mexican food on top of a smashing view, I'm sorry to disappoint you but this is not your place.   My first experience at Lindo was pretty good from what I recall but I had a seat right near the window and I was perhaps distracted by the scenery so much so I didn't pay much attention to the food..   The other night was \"Take II\" and we did NOT get the window seat. This fact led to more clarity on the entire dining experience. Service was nothing above standard and even slightly below if you want to get technical.   My True love in Mexican food life is a good guacamole..mmm..I was pumped about this $9 FRESH guacamole until I piled some on my chip (which wasn't fresh) and took a bite. It was filled with unripe tomatoes, overdosed in lime juice and I swear I was picking the cilantro out of my teeth the rest of the night and possibly the next day (overboard).   The food to follow was luke warm, massive and lacked flavor.. If you're wondering what I ordered, I think it was a #6? Chicken taco, enchilada, and something else that was \"soo good\" I can't remember, haha.   All in all if what you want is a great view of the city and you're not looking for fantastic service or authentic Mexican food, Lindo is the place to be!",

FULL of mexican decorations and not just the common maracas. Place was quiet, and the view fantastic. Tables were NOT back to back. Plenty of room to walk around if you wanted. Also, as you come in the front door, you can see the kitchen and watch them cook through the glass. They have a large bar which I plan on going back to try very soon. Service was great until after we got our check. Took server 10 minutes to come grab our card so we could pay. But other then that, he was there checking in on us every 5-10 minutes.

After waiting 10 minutes, we asked the young ladies at the desk and were told it would be a few more minutes. As more and more people came in and were added to the list, all being told 15-20 minutes wait, we asked again when we would be seated. Needless to say, the tables in the center of the restaurant stood empty. At that time we were told that they were waiting for a party of 44! Who takes a reservation for 44 people on Saturday at a popular neighborhood restaurant leaving 20 to 30 people on various size groups waiting for tables? After another 10 minutes, it is now after 6PM, the tables are still empty, the crowd getting bigger we were told it would be a few more minutes. With that, we made a reservation for another local restaurant and told them we were leaving. The manager and one of his staff chased us out to the parking lot telling us our table was ready now. Really? And, when we left, the 44 people still had not shown up. Very poor management! My friends and I will never return to this place.",

Nice looking place with a great million dollar view of the city through the expansive glass. I ordered the Carnitas which were cooked perfectly crispy and tender with enough fat to stay juicy. My friend had some type of enchilada platter that looked pretty typical. It was a good meal but we later lamented that we should have tried something more \"Authentic\" but played it safe with the tried and True. After dinner spent a few minutes in the parking lot trying to spot distant landmarks.",

    "text": "No More - gave it another try and bad experience again. The food is good but no better in quality as the nearby little Mexican take out diners. They display their food nicely in a beautiful environment. You should never have a bad experience at a restaurant, especially Mexican Restaurant, that has the high prices this place has. It's a special treat to go there for the ambiance and fabulous view of Las Vegas. But the last two times (Latest this week) it has been really bad from the management especially. First time we took a special out of town guest because she likes Mexican Food and is a vegetarian. There are vegetarian items on the menu but three times and long waits in between they put meat in all of her food. She never got her dinner-nor did the manager even stop by to help. The rest of the table ate as she waited. Second time - We received a promotion in the mail from the restaurant which advertised their happy hour and a 15% discount. We said \"Hey, we haven't been there in awhile, lets go.\" The promotion pulled us in. They would not accept the promotion we received saying that it was for the dinner hour only. (which the promotion did not say and we called their attention to) Still no deal. Now keep in mind, this made our experience so negative and for only a $2.25 promo. How cheap can they get for a classy place. And once again the manager did not come by to help. Our family knows this restaurant back in the day when it was just a little cart downtown Las Vegas. What a shame. I sure hope the downtown Vegas location is still good. We will never return to the Henderson NV location on Carniege.",

We walked in and it was so loud you had to yell to have a conversation. We always sit at the bar so we made our way over there and had perfect timing as a couple was getting up so we were able to sit down right away. We were there on a Sunday night and they had 4 bartenders and the place was packed, but the service was just flat out some of the worst I've ever come across. Every bartender had a scowl the whole time we were there. We ordered margaritas and for the second round we asked for it to be Cadillac and the bartender glared us even more and rolled her eyes. This is on the drink menu we weren't asking you do anything ridiculously hard or outside of your job description we were simply asking for you to add a floater to the top of the margarita. We order the carne Asada tacos which were very good and then the carnitas Coca Cola which was bar far one of the most unbalanced dishes I've ever had. And most of the pieces were super fatty and gross. Then all four bartenders were standing around talking to each other in a group while we the couples on both sides of us all had empty drinks and trying to get another round. The service was so terrible especially for the amount of staff they did have. The only reason I give this place 2 stars was for those tacos and the view other than that I would give this place 0 stars for the service, parking and the carnitas.",

    "text": "Service was spectacular!!! BUT........This is average Mexican food, nothing special. Even the \"atypical\" dishes aren't that outstanding. The chile rellenos with shrimp is bursting with good-sized shrimp but the peppers aren't cooked enough, too raw, and the sauce lacks flavor. Not worth the $20 price point. The mojo pollo, or Gallo al Mojo de Ajo, has a weird tang to its sauce. Either the wine is cooked too much in there or the garlic is off. Either way, not really impressive and not very mojo. I noticed no Guajillo pepper either. This is thinly sliced, grilled chicken with an average sauce. Typical gummy rice and refried beans on the side. The view is about the only thing worth revisiting at this location. Their prices are a bit high.",

I asked if it came with it because I thought I remembered seeing it in the photo on the menu. The server went and asked and came back and said the green sauce was a guacamole sauce.   The next morning I checked the menu online and saw that it was supposed to come with both a green sauce and guacamole.   It's a nice view though.",

    "text": "Visited for the first time today for a friend's birthday. The restaurant sits on the corner and is hard to miss. The parking lot was a little cramped.  Upon entry the atmosphere was very inviting and felt authentic with a warm and spacious ambiance.  There was seating on the patio, the main dining room and a room towards the back surrounded by windows. We were seated in the back room with a great view. I would suggest visiting as the sun sets the view of the strip,  and mountains would be amazing.  The service was great from some and lacking by others. The receptionist was not very friendly and pretty much ignored us until a manager asked if we had been helped. Our waiter didn't seem interested in answering any of our questions about items. We had to ask him several times about menu items. He actually told me to hurry up and order. Other staff though we're very nice and offered suggestions as most of us had never visited before. My water was frequently refilled as we're the chips, refried beans and salsa which are complimentary. In addition my friend appreciated the staff coming out and singing to her for her birthday as well as the shot and  churros she was served.  The margaritas were the highlight of our visit. They were very sweet but I like sweet drinks.I also enjoyed the Pina Rita it had just the right amount of everything. The food arrived quickly once we ordered. The portions were very generous. I ordered pork tacos with rice, beans and avocado. It was good, not spectacular. The birthday girl ordered and loved the steak fajita served on a sizzling skillet with lots of peppers and onions. Others in our group said the food could have used more seasoning. Taste is subjective though, some like it hot, others not. Overall though everyone enjoyed the meal with minor complaints .   Overall the experience was a good one. The view the ambiance and the margaritas and food made up for the lackluster service and average food..",

My cheese enchiladas were not skimped over on the cheese! Wow I was very impressed on the quality of the food.

The Chile Rellenos Camaron was good, however it was missing a bit of seasoning, but the Novillo Al Jerez was cooked perfectly.

The food is not bad nor is it great, its neither super authentic nor over the top tex-mex, some dishes works well and others are boring and uneventful.  The service today was underwhelming and not up to expectations, if you combine that with the robot like waiters who roams around and just removes stuff regardless of you are finished or just continuously drips of soups you don't want, and then getting the bill took way to long.  This is not my favorite place but again, the food is not bad i thinks the overall experience does affect that and i just think that there are better places right around.",

The vistas from this resto are fantastic -- you can see the entire Vegas skyline and the atmosphere inside the resto is very bright and cheerful.   Too bad the small parking lot cannot accommodate the number of diners here on a Sat. night. This is the second time I've had dinner here on a weekend and waited for more than 15 min for a spot!   But, onto the food.... the food at Lindo is surprisingly bland for a Mexican place. The table-side prep of the guac is a nice touch (as was the guac itself -- our server made it perfectly)... though the rest of the meal was so-so. My girl and I shared two shrimp entrees -- the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp a la diablo. Both were served SUPER SIZE style -- seriously. We should have gotten one entree to share between the two of us.... We would have packed the excess... had the food been better. SIGH.   Unfortunately, the Diablo in the shrimp dish must have gotten lost somewhere in the kitchen. Despite a couple of red chiles that I saw floating in the bright red sauce in which the shrimp were served, this dish was SUPER bland. Talk about a bait and switch!! As for the enchiladas, the tortilla to everything else ratio (cheese, sauce, shrimps) was off.... each time I took a bite, all I tasted was the mushy tortilla.   Oh well.... at least the place is pretty, and the servers are nice. Next time, I'll stick to liquids (their margaritas on the rocks are good), and guac.",

Takes a long time to get refills, your order taken, your food, etc..  Food portions are good and my BF and I have always enjoyed what we ordered.  Their food did make me sick once which is why food isn't 5 stars.  View of Vegas is great, however this place is a little on the noisy side for me",

This is outright outrages, even with assistance from the manager, we still have not been seated. I feel as if I'm an overseer of this restaurant rather than dining here. I've seen people come and go while I'm still waiting. After being seated, the food came in fast enough that we did not have to complain, we were also occupied with chips with salsa and frijoles. My enchiladas with mole and chicken was accompanied with the classic red rice and frijoles. Although nothing special, they were great. The chicken was on top of the smothered enchiladas. The mole was too potent to eat without the rice and beans. The chicken was rather bland but was needed to fully enjoy the enchiladas which only contained cheese. After finishing our meals, we were served a complimentary slice of cake and small serving of flan. They were both delicious and were enforced by the manager for out hour and a half wait. The mariachi band played in area of window side tables. Our party of seven were all full and satisfied and had multiple boxes of leftovers. The whole experience was long and felt like we spent our entire day there just for dinner. Overall the food was good but the staff was only helpful when one of the managers got involved.",

Every time we go I try something new but my husband loves the Camarones Abuelito Timo so much he always orders it. Our favorite waiter Renee doesn't even ask him what he wants, he just knows. I have loved everything I have tried at Lindo. The views are fabulous, the food is beyond your typical Americanized Mexican food. The drinks are great, superb service, the live music always awesome, and some nights there is a great Mariachi band. Expect to wait for a table but who cares, it's worth it.

Our waiter was great, watched him make guacamole at the tables, then our food came. I ordered the chilli colorado and she ordered a taco salad. The cook is amaizing as he figured out how to extract every bit of flavor from everything on my plate,  I could not even finish anything and I tried. This place has a great view,  but the food is horrible.  My co workers chicken on her taco salad tasted like they froze it, unthawed it, froze it again, un thawed it, scrubbed the toilet with it froze it and then cooked it untill it was as dry as he could get it, then he put it in one of the oiliest shells he could find. This was our first visit and on the way back to the office we stopoed at taco bell because we couldnt even finish our food.  At least the manager who didnt even come to the table gave our waiter permission to comp my meal. Needless to say I will never return to this establishment even if they are paying us to have a meal.",

Wasn't good service because of the lack of communication or asking \"How was everything.\" Ordered the burrito next.  Burrito tasted awful the chicken was incredibly dry. Oh ya, don't even bother trying their soup they give you it tasted very gross. Would recommend the fish tacos though as they were delicious. Overall, I think chipotle is better at a fraction of the cost",

The menu has a wide variety of favorites for those used to Tex/Mex food, but they offer so many of their own traditional Mexican family recipes that are delicious chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes. They have an open kitchen where you can see them not only cooking, but also making fresh flour and corn tortillas. Their oversized chips are served warm with a roasted pepper salsa that is incredible. They offer table side guacamole made to your specifications. Their meals are oversized, so you'll leave with leftovers. Their fresh fruit margaritas are authentic and delicious. They have an amazing birthday tradition involving their nightly performer who serenades with a guitar, plus lots of clapping and cheering by the wait staff, and a complimentary tequila shot. It's a bit pricey but well worth it! And they have the best view in Henderson.",

Our beef fajitas were not sizzling (not even hot)  and flavor just OK -- and our friend's ordered shrimp fajitas which hardly had any shrimp  Seriously, it was chintzy.  Flaming Fajitas on Tropicana really does it right. Our orders here were very ordinary.   We wanted to really love it -- but our food experience was very so-so.

There's still a little hope left that maybe they changed their hours and that's why they were closed... Anyhow, we decided to try the new Lindo Michoacan because it is near my house and I have eaten at the Green Valley location and thought it was o.k. so it's time for a second visit. It's nice in the inside-very spacious and of course the view is awsome!!! The whole strip is always in your view. Their chips , salsa and bean dip all needed seasoning. So right away I'm not happy. Not to mention the prices are too high-my chicken dish was $16.95. The kids meals were sad...3 mini quesadilla triangles are all they get on this huge plate coverded in beans and rice that the kids did not want to eat-what a waste!!! My chicken dish consisted of a pounded chicken breast covered in a chili and mayonaise mixture. That was very tasty but when everything else lacks taste it doesn't matter to me that one piece of a dish did have taste. We decided as a family that we didn't care to go back - there are so many other good Mexican restraunts in Las Vegas that I would save money on and not have to put salt in the salsa.",

While I was driving home I happened to check my account to be safe and sure enough within 20 minutes there was an online purchase. I called management at restaurant they never returned my call. This isn't the first time the waiter has done this because the phone number attached to the transaction my bank could not even trace, they seemed to use an online coupon store with over 20,000 vendors and nearly impossible to find the exact one. My advice: food isn't that great and if you want the view, pay cash!",

They were delicious. My only complaint would be that they use corn tortillas to make it more authentic. I hate ordering tacos and getting them in flour tortilla.   I also ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was delicious. Nothing special that \"wow\" me but I enjoyed it. The alcohol didn't overpower it. So if you like strong drinks then you probably wouldn't enjoy it because you hardly taste the alcohol.   My husband ordered goat meat and I tasted his food and I must say I didn't really enjoy it at all. The texture was very chewy and lack seasoning.   Overall our Experience was pleasant and will be going back to try a few more things off the menu.   The fidello soup was helpful to keep my toddler entertained while we ate. He seemed to like it but he likes pretty much everything. I'm not a fan of fidello soup... Don't like it's flavor.",

I'll start with positive highlights from today as I believe it's fair to point out the good. Today I decided to try a new item, the \"Milanesa con papas\" which is a lightly breaded steak with French fries on the side, this dish delivers in value, taste, portion size and presentation. Two thumbs up! One of our dinner companions today had not such a good experience which truly saddens me as I love this place and love it when people share my experience. Her dish seemed to take a little bit longer than expected, the restaurant was busy so we understand. However her steak came undercooked when she asked for it to be well done. Steak was taken back to the kitchen and came back burnt to the table. My humble suggestion to the manager would be for waiters to follow simple directions and relay them back to the kitchen. With that being said I will be back to give them another chance.",

    "text": "Conveniently located for me when I am in the mood for Mexican food, which is pretty much all the time.  My only hang up is that it can get pretty expensive depending on how many people are in your party.  Of all the locations in the Lindo empire, this one provides a most impressive view of valley.  I think that it might also be the loudest.  The acoustics make it very hard to hear.  Add the Mariachi band or the resident guitar player banging out a version of Marty Robinson's \"El Paso\" to the mix and you really have yourself incredibly LOUD fiesta.  I have never ordered anything bad from the menu.  I always leave fat, dumb and happy.  On my most recent outing I ordered Novillo Al Jerez.  This was a deliciously marinated (some kind of sweet Mexican wine) steak with crumbled bacon on it.  Yes...Bacon.  A staple appetizer is the Queso Fundido.  Unless you have a six pack or are lactose intolerant, who doesn't like gooey cheese with homemade tortillas?  I was also feeling like I wanted a margarita and so I ordered one.  The waiter suggested that I get a Cadillac margarita.  I took him up on his suggestion. It was fair and imagine when I got the bill and found out that it cost me $12 and I didn't even get a buzz!  Way to up sale Ivan!  As much as I would like to eat here more, I fear that I would end up fat, dumb and broke.",

    "text": "I have frequented this restaurant on several occasions and have always had a great experience. During this occasion however I was deeply disappointed with the service. The evening was off to a good start - our hostess was pleasant and promptly sat us at a great table with a view on the strip. We were greeted by the busser who brought us chips and salsa. Here is where things made a turn for the worse. We sat there waiting for some sort of acknowledgement from our server for more than 10 minutes. After 12 minutes the manager noticed my looks of confusion as I paned the room trying to decipher what the delay might be, as this was what seemed like a particularly slow night here (the slowest I've ever seen). The manager took our drink order and when the drinks were delivered our service decided to make an appearance with no mention of his absence. His opening words were \"are you ready to order?\" I was taken aback, I thought to myself am I at Taco Bell, or a sit down restaurant? After asking him if he would be our server, he responded \"I guess so.\" Every interaction with him we felt as if we were a bother to him, like he could care less about being at work. Our food was delivered by a runner, it wasn't until we were clearly done with our meals that our server asked how our meal was. The icing on the cake was the lack of a birthday celebration for my best friend, as this was my treat in honor of her. I went to the hostess stand at the beginning of the night to ask that they would do the whole desert and singing embarrassing moment for her. It appeared everyone was celebrating a birthday as no joke, we saw 5 other people get their celebratory moments, and the one for my best friend never came (she was probably happy to pass on the embarrassment) It was honestly one of the worst customer service experiences I've had in a long time,  with the plethora of restaurants to chose from, I will not be dining at this place again.",

I was impressed with how attentive our servers were.  My food was just OK. I ordered the \"Grandpa Timo's Shrimp.\" Translate into Spanish to order. It was gulf shrimp, stuffed with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon and then deep fried. Three of my favorite things in one dish. The shrimp was fantastic but the bacon was really really crunchy. The cheese and the Timo sauce were good.  My wife had the Orange Roughy and enjoyed it. Our meal, without drinks, came to about $42. Not too bad and truly worth it if the service is always going to be this great. We left a great tip.",

All of the food we ordered was flavorless and the chicken was so over cooked , the enchiladas I ordered barely had any cheese on it and again was flavorless and the chicken extremely dry.

Coming at non peak hours is your obvious option to increase your chances of getting better service.  As far as food, my suggestion is not to order the typical taco, burrito, enchilada, or fajita. You can find these items down the street in either direction, or hell, you can make them at home. I try and order a specialty dish which is usually a unique take that I haven't had or is not as common.  On the our most recent visit, our party of 7 had a reservation at 7 PM and were not seated at our corner window table until 7:20 with our order not being taken until 7:40. My cadillac margarita was served in a daiquiri glass which was interesting. Everything smoothed out after our order was placed.  The shrimp ceviche could have used a little more kick with more jalapeno. I think a bead of sweat is forming on my brow as I type that I had the camaron a la diabla. If you like spicy, this is the dish for you. We finished with some fried ice cream and that was OK. I've had about half of the beef dishes and have been pleased with all of them. Most of the specialty dishes range from $15-$20 and come with fideo soup, rice, beans, and tortillas.",

    "text": "This authentic restaurant feels like it could easily be in Los Angeles and not in the burbs of Henderson.  Its perch amongst the expanse of the desert gives diners the opportunity to enjoy a great view of the Las Vegas skyline; I recommend going to see the sunset colors.  Upon sitting down, you can readily enjoy a generous bowl of tortilla chips accompanied by refried beans and hot sauce. I'm not a fan of spicy, so I probably scooped a generous amount of beans alone. It's just ok; the chips aren't the freshest or the thinnest. Beans would be best served with some fresh queso fresco on top. Sadly, I think I may have scooped a part of the bowl that had a small hair! Forgivable but still eek.  Portions are large and hearty. All our dishes came with a starter of fideo soup (tomato-based broth with thin 1-inch Lipton-like noodles) and sides of Spanish rice and refried beans doused with melted cheese.  I got the chile relleno with shrimp, but I thought the pepper would be covered in the typical eggy batter. Sadly, it was not, and the pepper itself was more spicy than usual. As someone who can't handle spicy, it was a bit much. The shrimp was good though. I ended up getting a side of their 'regular' chile relleno which had the perfectly fried egg batter shell, and the pepper was softer (lighter green) and less spicy because it had been baked with the batter. My friend got the chile verde burrito with pork which came with generous pork chunks; sauce was delicious.  Another friend got the #10 combo which came with a beef tamale and a beef enchilada - also solid.  The ambiance is festive as they have a small band playing lively music. Acoustics yield a bit of a din, and many large parties are celebrating birthdays. The service crew will come around and sing a loud rendition of Happy Birthday while the celebrant wears a large sombrero. You can also play slots or electronic poker at the bar.  The parking lot can get crowded when they're busy, but you can easily find parking on the street.",

    "text": "I have been to this same location twice now and I intentionally waited to write a review to ensure it was honest.   First of all, this location is incredible. Sit at the bar or in the back room to get a fantastic view of strip and the mountain range (especially around sunset.) That alone is worth the price of the margaritas...which are FANTASTIC. Their margs are reasonably priced ($10-12) and absolutely delicious. You'll get a nice buzz and the fruit flavors taste real and fresh (even if they're aren't!)  Each meal comes with chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips are \"sturdy,\" the salsa is thick and has a real kick to it (maybe a bit too much kick) and the bean dip is hot and delicious.   Now, the last time I ate here, I had the cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped, deep fried shrimp at the suggestion of our waiter and it was memorable and tasty. This time, I went with something more traditional (the carnitas and bean burrito and beef taco with rice and beans) ...and the leftovers are still sitting in my fridge.  The meat in the burrito, despite appearing juicy, was so bland! There's really nothing else I can even say about it, to be honest. The same was True of the taco. The portions are large and the rice and beans are great, but there just wasn't any flavor coming through.   Conversely, my friend got the fish tacos with a side of their habanero sauce and raves about them constantly...but this second time around I just felt underwhelmed.   To their credit, the menu is gigantic, with something for everyone. The staff is friendly and service is prompt. They've even got a huge sombrero to celebrate (...humiliate?) people celebrating birthdays and everyone generally sings along in good spirit.   Expect to wait on the weekends. This Friday night our wait about about 30 minutes after arriving at 6pm, but they've got it done to a science and everything moves fairly quickly it seems. The main room can be very noisy (especially with live music) but the backroom is quieter...and colder.",

The menu is very extensive with much more than the typical Tex-Mex selections. Our table ordered Chile Verde de Marrano (pork in a Tomatillo sause), Camarones Abuelito Timo (bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cheese), Mole Poblano with chicken, and Pipian Verde (a green mole). They were each full of great flavor. The Margaritas, too, were excellent.  Lindo Michoacan has three locations in Los Vegas. The one in Henderson has a very large dinning room and part of it includes picture windows overlook the whole valley.",

    "text": "My last review of Lindo Michoacan (say that 5 times fast) was 7 years ago and it wasn't very good.  In the last few years I've changed my view on LM. Here's what I've learned. If you're looking for traditional Mexican food, enchiladas, tacos, rice, beans, then there are way better options in Vegas (Chapalas on Trop/Pecos). However, their specialty items are very good here. One item in particular keeps me coming back, the Pollo con Rajas y Crema. American for Chicken with sauteed peppers, onions, and topped with a really awesome cream sauce.  So that's what I've learned, their specialty items are actually really good. Their traditional stuff, schmeh.   The prices here are still out of sorts (for Mexican food) in my opinion. $15+ for most entrees. However, if you can make it for their lunch specials then you can cut your bill by a good 30-35% while getting the same exact food. Also, they make all of their tortillas in house, so no matter what you order make sure to get a few of these to accompany your meal.  Chips always come with salsa and beans. Not a fan of their salsa, but their beans are good for dipping purposes. Their table side guacamole is also pretty tasty as well.   The Pollo con Rajas y Crema is where it's at for me though. Thin chicken breast, it's almost always cooked to perfection, not tough. The onions and peppers are never too crunchy, which is a pet peeve of mine, cook those little flavor sensations up! You always get a dollop of guac to go with it. Honestly, I almost never eat the rice & beans that accompany the entree because I'm just not a fan of them. Plus, by the time the meal comes I've usually eaten 635 chips.  Service here is usually pretty reliable. Drink & chip refills usually don't have to be prompted, they are very proactive.  The view at this location makes the whole experience worthwhile. One of the best views in the valley if you get a table next to the window. Also, they usually have live music which is fun.",

The waiter was very attentive you wouldn't have noticed he was juggling as many tables as he did.   My food was really good I asked for medium rare and that is what I received. To top it off the server literally prepared the quacamole right in front of us.   Only downside would have to be the price. For my food and one drink my bill was $40.  The margarita could have been better as well. Definitely recommend and make sure to get a reservation.",

We came on a Saturday at around 5:45PM with a party of 12.  Since it was still sort of early, thankfully, we were seated right away.  The inside is festively decorated with typical Mexican decor.  The back side of the restaurant has a beautiful panoramic view of the city.   For a party of our size, service was prompt and efficient.  Our server was friendly and attentive,  keeping our drinks and chips filled before we had to ask.    Speaking of chips, theirs were fresh and crispy and came with delicious, homemade salsa AND a creamy bean dip. So good!  Everyone enjoyed their meals tremendously.  I ordered their flautas plate, which came with SIX flautas (with your choice of meat), guacamole, crema, and rice & beans.  Delicious!  Enough for 2 people to share!  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!",

A few of my favorite dishes include the avocado salad (shrimp ceviche served in two avocado halves), the camarones sarandiados (OMG THAT SAUCE), and the lengua en salsa verde (for you cow tongue lovers).

    "text": "I have been to the other locations and this location seems to be on par with the rest. I come from Los Angeles where Mexican restaurants are on every corner all ranging from one store to phenomenal five stars. Las Vegas seems to be lacking a True Mexican spirited restaurant but this comes as close to it as possible.  The one thing that stands out above and beyond this location from the other locations as well as many other Mexican restaurants is the incredible view. This alone makes it worth the drive and the trip. Perfect for a romantic getaway or a special occasion.  If you're fortunate enough to get seated along the window section then definitely try to get here after sunset. We were seated in the main dining room where they had \"an entertainer.\" Not sure exactly where they found this guy but I hope they're not paying him much.  We started off with the cheese fondue. I'm a traditionalist and I love their version. Just some plain melted jack cheese with some green chilies served with warm flour tortillas. I suggest splurging for the sour cream or guacamole which compliments this exceptionally. If you don't want to splurge then it goes perfectly with the complementary bean dip and salsa that they provide. We gave this a solid 5/5.  I proceeded to have the shrimp ceviche salad. It's served inside and avocado shell, skin. Nice big juicy chunks of shrimp marinade it perfectly with lime juice served with tomatoes and onions. The amount you get for the price you pat is fabulous. I give this one a 5/5 as well.  My friend went ahead and got the combination. A taco and a chili relleno. The chile was small, lacked flavor and had some salads on top that lacked any real merit. It was accompanied with a shredded beef taco. Meat was secretly under seasoned. The shell itself seemed to be old and quickly fried again to give it some crispy ness. Beans and rice were lacking. Taco Bell standard at its highest. 2/5 for the combo.  We finished with the fried ice cream. Not bad, not great. Caramel sauce they drizzle on top was decent.  Overall it was good. I got the feeling service would have been better if we had been drinking or the tab was higher. Had to ask for refills on drinks a few times. Other than that the highlight for this place is the view for sure.",

    "text": "5 stars for the amazing view of the city from the top of the hill. And another 5 stars to my tasty margarita that gave me a buzz after just one. Everything else was just blah.   Food: I've dined here a few times already and I've had my fair share of Mexican food. I can honestly say we make way better Mexican food at home. The food is so Americanized and doesn't feel authentic at all. The salsa and beans for the chips were bland and we had to add more salt. The fideo soup that was served with our meals was way too salty. The chicken in the tacos was dry and flavorless. I've had better tacos at Roberto's for way less $. The steak was low quality and chewy. The side of avocado that we ordered was brown and hard. How does that even happen?   Service:  The hostess that was at the stand was a complete b***h. She asked how many were in our party and I said 3. When I proceeded to ask her how long the wait was, she completed ignored me and started talking to the hostess next to her. Another hostess heard me saying how annoyed I was, so she compensated for her rude coworker and was extra nice to us. Our waiter (didn't get his name) was decent enough, but we hardly ever saw him. We only saw him when it was time to order and when it was time to drop off the check. The busser however, was awesome. He cleared our plates, refilled our water and checked on us multiple times. We ended up tipping him on the side and told him not to share with anyone because he did an amazing job.   Ambiance:  It's your typical Mexican restaurant with your regular decor. It's clean with plenty of seating. Get a table by the window. The restaurant sits on top of a hill, so like I said, you get an amazing view of the city.   The quality of the food drops my rating down to a 2. But with the awesome views and drinks, I can give this place a solid 3. Good first date spot, but I'd rather go somewhere else for my Mexican food cravings.",

    "text": "Always find ourselves coming in for their lunch specials. Wide range of dishes and proteins. Love the shredded beef salad. It comes with it seems a cup of marvelous beef in their taco shell with a sprinkling of lettuce and small splotch of guac.   Seems popular.  The chicken soup had also about a cup of chunks of white chix. Big pieces of carrots, squash and a corn cob piece. Comes with 2 tortillas ( corn or flour).  My 2 main draws are the Cadillac Margarita on the rocks and their chips, salsa and refried beans. Salsa is spiced with wonderful heat and flavor, for me.  The view and easy parking are plusses, too. I like the servers outfits, too. A comfortable place.",

Our youngest children have special needs and sometimes the music is a bit loud for them. Tonight our daughter was really struggling with the music. The musician recognized her struggle, paused the music and took a break. He didn't have to and we didn't ask but wow we appreciated it and so did our daughter. It gave her time to regain her composure. I appreciate the heart of this restaurant so much.  Customers for life",

I kid you not it was Jack cheese melted on top of a green Chile. You couldn't even dip a chip in there because it was a robbery hard piece of cheese. Nothing mixed in with the melted cheese just melted cheese on top of green Chile. It wasn't edible. Their guacamole is OK but how can you screw up guacamole. The enchilada sauce was flavorless. No spice at all.  This is a place for people to go have Mexican food who don't like Mexican food. This is a great place for atmosphere and a Mexican vibe with none of the spice or flavor of authentic Mexican cuisine.",

Their table made Guacamole was delicious along with bean dip and salsa for their never ending fresh chips. They also serve you a cup of Fideo soup that is delicious prior to your meal arriving. All 8 of us enjoyed our meals and the entertainment tonight. The menu is large and varied so be prepared to have a lot of options to choose from. The views from this restaurant in Henderson are incredible as you can see all the lights on the Strip and as far West as Red Rock Canyon. Plenty of parking and very busy, go early or make reservations.",

    "text": "I had the absolute pleasure of having dinner here tonight. First I have to talk about the view. It is spectacular. The restaurant overlooks the city, and the sunset was absolutely breathtaking.  We sat down, and shortly received chips, salsa, and a bean dip. The bean dip was delicious, and a pleasant little something extra. The salsa was a little spicy for our pallet, but it had good flavor. We ordered the shrimp ceviche to start. (It was recommended by our waiter) All I can tell you folks, is YES. Oh my goodness, yes. If you are looking at it, Order it. You will not be disappointed. It came accompanied with to tostada shells, and fresh fresh avocado. Fantastic first impression.   For my entree I was feeling a little adventures, so I ordered soapa de 7 mares. Actually to be completely honest, a woman at the table next to us raved over it- so naturally I had to try it. (Especially after hearing how tasty it was)  The seafood and vegetables in this soup was so fresh and flavorful its not even funny. Surprisingly, the zucchini was one of my favorite parts of the soup. It soaked up all of the flavors of the seafood, and was simply delectable.   My husband ordered the carnitas burrito. You guys. This burrito was enormous. Like the size of a 2 liter of soda huge. He could only eat half of what was on his plate, and still had a full sized meal to take home. I was lucky to score a taste of the pork, and it was so tender and flavorful. The burrito had a super yummy green sauce drizzled on top that pulled the dish together. He made a good choice with that one. We left super full, and very excited about our fun dining experience. Next time we plan to order the guacamole, it was a huge portion and they made it table side so you know it's nice and fresh. (We saw them make it for the table next to us)   Can't wait to come back, definitely worth trying!",

Servers are VERY nice, quick, and enjoyable!  Cons; 1. No flavor to the food have tried this place twice now hoping for better result but sadly disappointed. Far from authentic. Very very bland. I've honestly tasted better flavor at Roberto's. 2. Parking lot is very small, but obviously didn't have much land to work with so not entirely their fault.  If you are looking for good flavor Mexican food I'm sorry but you won't find it here. Good service yes, but zero flavor.",

I always sit next to the huge windows at the back of the building where I can see the entire Vegas valley. It's especially nice during a storm or sunset. The staff is always fantastic. Manny has been serving us for years and we love him. He always asks about our families who live out of town but visit Vegas yearly.  Since most of the dishes are authentic Mexican it can be hard to know what is actually in them. I suggest asking the waiters a lot of questions. Please for the love of God don't order a taco, burrito or taquito at a fine place like this. Experiment a little and try something new.  They have live music many evenings and they come sing at your table if it's your birthday. It can get really loud on Friday or Saturday nights.  The building is truly beautiful inside and outside.",

Very happy friendly and super efficient.  We had a house margarita and enjoyed the extremely spicy salsa with chips.  Just like we like it.  The food was very good although for we who love spicy the shredded beef was a bit flat which was easily remedied by the addition of the great salsa.  We would definitely return when in the area.",

    "text": "We love Lindo Michoacan! We, usually, go to the one right next to our house (on W. Flamingo), but we travel to this one whenever we have company in town because of the beautiful view of the strip. We've been lucky enough that each visit we've been seated next to the windows to enjoy the view.  The complimentary salsa, refried beans, and tortilla chips are quite filling... so, take it easy to ensure you have room for your actual meal. The beans are sometimes bland, but nothing a little salt can't fix. Besides, this isn't the main reason we come here.  With every meal, we've gotten a cup of their fideo soup (which kind of reminds us of those Lipton Cup a Soup packets). No matter, it's still yummy!  My go to dish is their Pollo con Rajas y Crema (pounded chicken breasts with onions and pasilla chilies in a cream sauce) served with rice and refried beans. So delicious! Every Lindo location I've visited, the dish has tasted the same... so, that makes me happy! My bf likes to have something different each time, so he's tasted everything from their Filet Relleno to the Chile Verde to their selection of Lengua.  We've not been disappointed by any of our selections and will continue to visit this and other Lindo Michoacan locations.",

I told them they forgot my meat which is a 3$ difference in price from regular nachos. They took the dish and just added meat and more more cheese and ran it under the broiler again thus burning the twice cooked chips to a rock hard delicacy. With all this said 20 minutes later I am brought out my food and my gf is all most done eating her food. Kind of beats the purpose of eating as a couple.

Unfortunately it is also the busiest location and they have a tiny parking lot, so expect to park in the office lot across the street.  Back to the view, they have large glass windows which look out onto the entire Vegas skyline.  The restaurant sits on top of a small hill within an already elevated part of Henderson, which provides the best view for a price in town!  Food wise I can't taste a big difference between all the locations, but I still prefer the original DI location for its classic feel.  You can easily fill up with a $15 combo plate here and the food will be very consistent!",

The view is a beautiful skyline of the Las Vegas Strip.    As for service, our busser Angel was a bit more active than our waiter in terms of ordering.  The Dessert Inn location seriously has it down when it comes to overall service.  As for the food, the salsa, beans, and chips are something you must watch out for if you plan to eat your main course!  The salsa combined with the beans has just the right amount of heat that you lose yourself in them, and the busser just keeps them coming.  The tomatoe based fideo soup served before the main course is also good.  It reminds me of my moms.  I normally stick with Camarones Abuelito Timo, I was happy to see that the flavor is consistent between the other restaurants.  bacon wrapped, cheese covered shrimp, with a delicious mayo/Tabasco aioli....can't go wrong with bacon!

I was excited when I found out a couple months ago that they opened a location in Henderson so everyone is the area could enjoy such awesome Mexican food, but when it was my turn to try this one out I wasn't so happy.  First off the building use to be a Italian restaurant so it doesn't have the same feeling as the other locations. I like to feel like I'm in Mexico while eating good Mexican food, there is like no atmosphere here. Yes there are great views but it's kinda hard to enjoy when you're back to back with everyone around you. The tables are so jammed in this place I was so uncomfortable.   Next up the orders were so butchered and the service was not the usual standard I am use to at the other Lindo locations. The table side guac never came, there was like no tequila in the margaritas even when we order a double, and the changes to the orders weren't there.  The server was cocky and didn't really help us out when we weren't happy.  I know it was a busy Saturday night but there are some things I don't think are going to change because of the layout of the restaurant. Just not the same. I will stick to the West Flamingo and Desert Inn locations.",

The decor is very tastefully arranged with Mexican culture and the waiters where very nice.  You pay for what you get. It's not pricey, but it's not cheap either.

It's an upside down corona extra in a Cadillac margarita. Overall great restaurant, and my number one choice for such in Vegas.",

We had to wait a long time to be seated despite having a reservation in advance. The parking situation isn't the best if you come at prime dinnertime. You'll end up having to park across the street (there are No Parking signs on the same side as Lindo that no one seemed to observe). Really nice view of town though!",

I am not a huge Mexican food fan, which is surprising since I am from Texas but the place was nice and the view was pretty good.  Too bad we had a sand storm so you really couldn't see the strip.    When you first walked in, the smell of the restaurant is sooo yummy!  I ordered the whole fish, Mojarra Frit o Al Mojo de Ajo...which was deep fried Tilapia.  It was so good!  And it freaked my colleagues out because it was a whole fish and came with it's head...hahaha!  The only thing I didn't get or like was it came with lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole and stead cut french fries which seems to be out of place for such a pretty dish.  I would have rather had more rice.  If I am to go back again, that is what I will ask for.  The soup they serve, Fideo Soup was just perfect!  We also ordered fresh  guacamole, which they come by the table and you watch them make it in front of you, which is awesome!  And very tasty and fresh.  I wasn't too impress with the bean dip and hot sauce dip that came with the chips.  But hey I think that's a marketing way for you to order the guacamole.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience but I think I will go again with peeps I don't work with and probably come back with even better review!",

This was an amazing Mexican restaurant from the decor to the ambiance to the food the only reason it's not a 5 star is because of some mediocre service. It was slow to start but ended up good at the end. I had the fajitas de Reyes which were amazing really good seasoned meat followed with the perfect amount of peppers onions and tomatoes. The rest of my party really enjoyed the food as well. The evenin was topped off with a mariachi band that was playing live music. This is not on the strip in fact no where near it and we wouldnt have know about it except for family that lives in lv. The fried ice cream was delicious and we all shared because the portions are very generous! Be ready to eat when you get there cuz from beginning to end it's all food!",

    "text": "We visited on a Sunday night over President's Day weekend and it was PACKED - even at 7pm, we had to wait 30 min for a table. The server was decently attentive but kept forgetting the kids' drinks and had to be reminded repeatedly.  The chips are house made, hot, and greasy - beware of filling up on them before the meal comes, especially on a long wait like we had!  And the accompanying dip came in two varieties:  uber spicy salsa (high bar for uber spicy here) and bland bean dip.  I found myself wishing for something moderate. The kids liked the bean dip, however. Thumbs up for the frozen margarita that helped wash it all down (for us -- lemonade for the kiddos :))  .  Do the skinny option for a more authentic experience, if you don't want that nasty sweet and sour mix.  OK - onto the entree.  Everyone seemed  happy with their choice -- my wife got a goat soup that was unusual and tasty, from the bite I had. I got an orange roughy dish that was stuffed with shrimp, octopus, and cilantro/tomato mix, then lightly fried and coated in a creamy sauce that was --  yes, uber spicy!  And delicious.  I found myself wishing for two stomachs and regretting all of those chips, as there was no way I could finish it. All in all, considering that we live in Seattle and yearn for authentic Mexican, this fit the bill with some unique dishes we'd never tried before.",

Aside from having a fantastic date with my special someone, Lindo Michoacan did not satisfy my expectations.   My date enjoyed his margaritaS. He got two of them. So all you drinkers out there, drink up. This stuff is good. (So he said.)   Besides the complimentary chips and salsa + bean dip....we also ordered guacamole for an additional charge. The guac.... +1 star. They prepare it fresh right in front of you....with all the mixings of cilantro, onions, tomatoes and your choice of the level of spiciness.  Our entrees, both of us ordered the combination dishes; a beef tamale and one enchilada (choice of beef or cheese.) Combination dishes includes rice and beans. I opted for all rice please. My beef tamale was pretty bland....and my beef enchilada wasn't very good. Also, pet peeve of mine: I love my food pippin hot. They brought out my entree warm. Ehh.... =/ I just settled with it and ate my food. Although filling, it just left something to be desired.  To sum it up: +1 for the guacamole dip +1 for the great view of the city of Las Vegas that my date reserved for us. +1 for the waiter service.  Sadly...that's pretty much it. Just like how Olive Garden can be considered \"fake\" Italian and PF Changs is glorified Asian food. Well....Lindo Michoacan can be added to the \"fake\" Mexican food. Give me some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant instead.",

They do take reservations for large parties and smaller parties if you plan ahead. Once you get seated the service is top notch. Right away you get chips, salsa and beans be careful the salsa does pack some heat. I always order the jumbo frozen margarita and my husband gets jumbo margarita on the rocks both are around $9-$12. We usually start with table side guacamole and fundido with no chorizo. I highly recommend the fundido if you like CHEESE! Every entree comes with a cup of fideo soup to start. My husband and I usually get Shrimp Diabla or Chicken Tia Esther. Both are must try dishes and both come with warm homemade tortillas, beans, rice and guacamole scoop. This place isn't the cheapest but you certainly get your money's worth.",

Lindo needs to step up their game. Food is more bland every time, service a little slower. Oh, and their table side guacamole. Can we talk about the amount of onions?!

It did not appear that any particular server was assigned to a dedicated set of tables.  One waiter took the orders, another brought drinks, yet another brought food and then another brought the bill.  After serving, not one stopped by to question if everything was satisfactory.  The salsa was simply too spicy.  Our menu choices appeared bland and more like commissary fare.  The tacos were on the greasy side.  Parking is a challenge to say the least.  The noise level is very loud and it is difficult to maintain a normal level of conversation.  Their restaurant has plenty of potential, but sadly was not found.  There seemed to be the attitude of maintaining a high turnover, but not emphasis on a quality experience in either food or service.  A return visit is quite doubtful.",

AND they have free parking.    I have tried different things EVERYTIME and BLEH!! Tonight we ordered guacamole (which is prepared table side, nice touch!) our server who I said not to much of jalapenos or cilantro. He looked at me nodded his head, then Proceeded to ask me about jalapenos & cilantro..... This server whom we had b4, has a concentration issue. Maybe he's been a server so long he's bored...really don't know but I do know he doesn't pay attention!     I wish I could say something more pleasant, just can't find anything complimentary to say. They're are busy so I guess they're just NOT my kind of Mexican fare~",

I like to order the guacamole- they make it in front of you. Their margaritas and pina coladas are spot on. Love the atmosphere, and how large the restaurant is. Its a beautiful restaurant and its place in a beautiful spot. Restaurant is clean, the servings are big, the servers always check in on you, and refill your drinks before they become empty.  I think some of the negative reviews on here are of especially picky people or perhaps they had encountered a newbie- or also perhaps they meant to review the Lindo Michocan on Desert Inn rd. I'd like to think myself as a picky person, and I've never had an issue with this restaurant.",

    "text": "We have friends who come into town irregularly, but we always go here for lunch. Even with the pouring-down rain, the view was impressive. Their lunch menu is extensive and cost-saving.  The food is NOT the typical Mexican food; they specialize in food from other areas, rather than just the Tex-Cali-Mex dishes. Two of us had tongue with peppers and onions (Lengua a Michoacan)), a default meal for both, a third had a creamy chicken (Pollo con Rajas Y Crema) entree, and I had shrimp in a spicy sauce (Camarones Serandeados). The good was excellent, as usual. Even with the downsized lunch portions, we took some good home.  The service was mostly good, with our drinks being refilled repeatedly.  When it came time for dessert, we asked about a flaming dish we'd seen at another table; they said it was fried ice cream. We ordered one to share. At this point, the service slacked off a bit, with us having to ask for spoons and plates.  Behind the bar (which as also has the view) there are a multitude of empty bottles of tequila/mezcal, artfully arranged.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the southeastern part of the valley. The views are wonderful, especially at sunset, the lunch specials are good until 5pm, and the food is deliciously unexpected.",

The time before that, it was slightly less than forever. Today, never once were our water glasses refilled. We left 2 EMPTY water glasses on top of the bill. Seems to be that the B Team works the area near the windows. If our waiter sucks (Maybe new? Overwhelmed? Incompetent?) and your other waiters know and have been staring at customers (us) waiting f o r e v e r for the check, maybe those waiters standing around trying not to make eye contact, should simply do the right thing and just get our check? Don't you think that's a better look? We only asked 2 of you who were completely not busy to help us get our check when our waiter went MIA f o r e v e r. Good luck, you'll find us at another Mexican restaurant from now on.",

We literally only saw our waiter once the entire night, and once we were ready to go, it took him 20 minutes to grab the card to pay the check. I understand it's busy, but it was a Tuesday night, and not that many customers were there. Also, management did see us waiting, and made eye contact with my boyfriend, but still nothing was done.

We sat at the bar, which along with a portion of the dining room, overlooks the valley and the strip. Views are beautiful, and I bet at night, it is really amazing. Being gambling degenerates, we threw a couple of $20s in and the machines are very tight! We asked the bartender if they are always this tight, and she said \"Someone hit a royal a couple of weeks ago\", well, that is pretty tight if you ask me! So gambling there = no. Now for the service, very good. Attentive and very friendly bartender, and since we were foolishly gambling, the drinks were on the house. And the food... my husband ordered the Sopa 7 Mares, which is a seafood soup. It was loaded with beautiful seafood and was really good. I ordered the Menudo, which is a tripe and hominy soup. The interesting thing is that they don't put hominy in the soup unless you ask for it added, which I found very odd. But it was good after they brought me a bowl of hominy to add.   We went here again with some tourist friends, and sat in the dining room overlooking the strip. Pretty good food, but I have to be honest, not the best. I am from San Diego, where there are no shortage of excellent Mexican restaurants. This place doesn't compare to any of them. And the prices are quite high for what you get. We haven't been there since, and probably won't return.",

The chips, salsa and beans which are completely free and unlimited are delicious. We have tried almost everything on the menu. They are batting 90% on the great/good side. Not crazy about their red enchilada sauce but everything else is the bomb. This place is second to none in Henderson/ Las Vegas metro. Possible THE best tacos I've ever had. Their salsa is 80% pure blended chili with garlic and onions added. It has a perfect balance and is hot. If you don't like hot food maybe stick to your regular bland diet but Mexican food is traditionally hot. 5 stars on their table side guacamole and their margaritas rock. You can NOT beat the view of the city. Ask your hostess to seat you in the glass view room and try to catch the city lights after dark.",

They are always packed, but the waits are never too long, and the overall experience is worth the wait.  Their chips, salsa and bean dip are perfect. Their servers and wait staff are attentive and great at their jobs.  The food, to die for. They have an extensive menu that leaves nothing out. The shrimp cocktail is delightful, the guacamole, which they prepare table side, is impeccable, and their entrees on point.

Now, for the meal.   I purchased the beef tamale and beef enchilada. They were both red sauced. I think it was the only tamale on the menu,  no green sauce. Booooo.  It wasn't  amazing, but I did enjoy the beans and rice.   I took leftovers and consumed the next day. I felt like the hulabaloo missed me. I'll go and try something else with green sauce, if they have any. Oh,  I did get some carne asada chunks in my enchilada. That was tastier than the shredded beef that occupied the majority of my meal.",

    "text": "I really, really, want to give Lindo a better rating but each time there is something that lets me down.   The food: Awesome. The flavor is great and the menu is vast. You are sure to find something you like here. The chips and salsa are great too. I usually order the chicken or veggie fajitas which are fantastic or the carne asada tostada - love it. They also serve this awesome tomato/garlic soup before dinner. I love it.   The service: Sub-par. The waiters are always friendly, but they always mess up at least one of the orders. It's frustrating. Not sure if it is the language barrier or what, but without fail, something usually goes wrong.   The atmosphere: Great views of the strip and Henderson. The downside is they keep it hella loud. On top of the talking, they have live music. Instead of being entertaining, it is mildly annoying if you are sitting around it.   The parking: On a Friday or Saturday night, there is never enough parking. You either end up walking a bit or parking across the street which is \"not allowed\"  My recommendation is, if you are going to eat here, go for lunch. The food is worth it, but the noise and service on a weekend is not.",

The food looked good but was very bland, I added the salsa from the chips to my meal.  The sauce for the green pork burrito was odd tasting too....very lime/citrusy tasting.",

Our last time here was ehh, but we decided to give it another chance especially because we were craving good mexican. This however was far from good mexican. My husband ordered the filet relleno and said it tasted like mayo and was disgusted by the chile relleno. I had the fajitas and they only came with two tortillas and were quite bland and over cooked and just tasted like cheap beef. At Viva these dishes were delicious but here they're far from. The ambiance was terrible as well. Viva would always have these great musicians singing and playing guitar but you could still have a conversation. This place was loud the musician was singing to a synthesizer that was terrible and so loud.  It was just painful.On top of the acoustics are so terrible in this location, even without the horrible music its still super loud. We won't be back and we're sad to lose one of our favorite mexican restaurants.",

    "text": "OK, I just have to say something: NEVER go to Lindo Michoacan when you are hungry (or think you are hungry).  The food is not only tasty but you can't help but eat everything they have.  We had a very good experience (other than the horrible service).  The waiter was just standing around and we waited for our checks, for him to take our dessert order, and he was very stingy on the refills.  My partner ordered the Vegetarian Fajitas and I ordered the Fish Tacos.  The Veggie Fajitas were great but they don't give enough tortillas in my opinion.  He got 2 when it is possible to make at least 3 for the meal.  He enjoyed it for sure.  My Fish Tacos were scrumptious!  Instead of a whole, fried fish fillet, they use pieces of fish then fry them.  It also came with this spicy ranch dressing that was very tasty.  Now, I am not a fan of spicy foods (since it makes me sweat), but the ranch dressing was so good I let go of my aversion to spicy foods.  As if the meal wasn't enough, we ordered dessert!  My partner had his favorite, the Sopapillas.   I ordered the Flan.  OMG!  The flan was awesome.  It was almost as good as my mom's.  Now, that is a very good compliment since my mom makes the best flan.  It is on the pricey side, but with the gourmet preparations of the food, it is very much worth it.",

Yes the food is OK, what is memorable are the chips, salsa and the favorable bean dip served quickly when you are seated. The menu is overwhelming and takes a while to absorb. The wait staff is professional and attentive. The food portions are good, but the food is average at best. My son had the Fried Garlic Snapper and said it was very bland and had no garlic taste. My wife had Carnitas and said she had better. I came out on top with the Pork Chop dish (Can't even give the Mexican name) which had an excellent sauce. However, the rice and bean sides were bland and ordinary, the bean dip was better tasting. I have had better refried beans at places like Fausto's. The Spanish rice was dry and flavorless. Deserts were wonderful, the flan was tasty and very creamy, everyone liked the  cake. Go here for the ambiance and view and don't have great expectations for the food.",

    "text": "Went here last night... Usually every time I've gone it's been great!  Not this time, we walked In around 9 pm after I got off work. We were seated promptly and in a nice booth, while we waited for maybe 8 min I noticed the time because I had been watching my phone.... Then the manager walks by noticed we were still waiting thanks to him, Nestor came to our table. Let me say this server had no personality we were greeted with \"do you want a drink?\" We order two Cadillac margaritas ($10 each) he brought out the drinks... \"Do you want to order?\"  Sure can we start out with the guacamole!  Now I assume that table side guac would include some sort if conversation other then just \"how spicy do you want?\"   Nope not for us that night... After he finishes mixing our guac he places it on the table next to our chips and salsa that were brought to the table while we waited on a server to come to the table... So by now we have less then half of our chips. One would think that when you order a app of guacamole you would get more chips? Next Nestor wants us to order  with his over the top \"do you want to order now?\" Sure I say because by now I'm over him and his lack of service skills lets just order... We both order and my boyfriends food comes correct but looks like a microwaved set of chips and cheese with dry (ill guess had been sitting in a third pan in a steam table all night) chicken with canned jalapeno that they call nachos! Great I ordered 2 chicken tacos that came with soup rice and beans... I received    2 chicken tacos on a plate.... Nothing else lucky for me the food runner brought out out food and I quickly let him know I was missing half of my order... He was really nice about it and said he would fix it (I wish he was my server at least he cared about what was going on at the table!).  The only time we got to see our server again was 1 while he stood in the middle if the dinning room watching the game highlights on the tvs or 2 when he came by to say \"want another drink?\" Never to ask how was our meal was or would you like dessert?? Nothing it had to be the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant!!!  My boyfriend always has a sweet tooth so I really wanted to order him a dessert... But when the bill was just dropped off at the table I was over it! All in all my bill was 75 dollars I have never left a server less then 20% EVER but this was the worst night ever I left him $10 and that was being nice... i wanted to write on the bill what i thought about the service but really thought would he even care???  I was so mad with the evening we left to go to smiths to buy wine and dessert since we both had a horrible experience I assumed I would have a better time at home! Should have picked up Roberto's and made my own guac and drinks at home! At least I would have had a great dinner and would have saved money....",

    "text": "Like many other reviewers, had been to other locations and lived nearby so this was a natural place to try out. The first  major difference though is the seating - not like the others it is very much a more open floor plan but the view...just WOW. A giant wall of window overlooking the entire city of Las Vegas. Go at sundown for an impressive show. It is not quiet though, between the open floor plan noise and the mariachi singing its not a place for a quiet date. Wish they had seating outside for the cooler evenings like the night I went but with all the windows it kinda felt almost like you are.  I ended up behind the bar and got my favorite at other locations - a Cadillac margarita. This one didn't have quite the kick like the ones I have gotten in other locations however. I watched the girl pour it and they put a good amount of tequila in but it just didn't seem as potent. Beyond that though everything was great. I love the carnitas! Make sure you come in hungry though as they make sure to fill you up! The servers at this location were great and friendly and one even shared a knowing smile and nod with me when a woman walked by wearing a tube top that barely held them in (if you know what i mean ;)). Its a little pricey for the types of dishes they serve but well worth it for the ambiance of mariachis and the view. I think those things make up for the price that the other locations don't really have.",

    "text": "This was my second time here. My first experience was great but this time around, not so much.I asked the waiter what is the difference between Al Ajillo and Al Mojo de Ajo, he answered that it is the same thing, that it was just a misprint on the menu. He said its just garlic salt, pepper and a little spice. So I ordered a steak with shrimp al mojo de Ajo but when i received the plate it was covered in a wine sauce. A wine sauce that was supposed to be reduced but instead was watery.The waiter never even mentioned it had wine and there was so much it ruined the meat, rice, etc. My husband let the waiter know of our disappointment but we never received an apology from him. We did receive great service from other staff members but that isn't enough to make me go back to this restaurant. People do seem to enjoy the atmosphere here but I prefer to enjoy my food and this place couldn't do that for me.",

Fortunately we arrived before the rush and were promptly seated by a very friendly staff.  We immediately received chips and salsa along with requested water. The menu is nothing short of overwhelming, but in a positive way.  Talk about selection and variety.  Everything sounded good but ultimately we made our selections (one steak entree, one chicken entree) which arrived in a timely manner, despite how busy it was.  Our server was friendly and attentive and they always kept my glass full of water.  Both of us completely finished our plates and the taste of the food was totally wonderful.  Even their tortillas were full of flavor.  Overall we had a truly wonderful dinner with top notch service and the view of the city from inside is spectacular.  Upon our departure, the line for seating was out the door - obviously this is a very popular establishment.  I cannot wait to return.",

Pricey as far as Mexican food goes, but the food, service, and atmosphere were excellent, and the portions are huge. Get a table by the windows for a gorgeous view. It is a little chilly there if it's a cool evening, so dress accordingly, but worth it. Even had a great kids menu. Service got a little slower as the evening got later and they got very busy, so if you bring kids, I recommend getting there earlier in the evening. Definitely recommend this place.",
