Right next to the bistro their is a gift shop that sells signed cookbooks and other Giada merchandise.

My husband and I went to Vegas for un'corked and I guess Giada was in town as well since she was part of the event. When we walked in the restaurant to get a gelato...she was there...behind the counter and my husband started fangirling over how happy he was and.....I said to him \"who is Giada? who is he?\" *facepalm* I was at her restaurant and had no idea who she was.   So next day I returned to her restaurant for a breakfast sandwich. I ordered the Antipasti breakfast sandwich and her kale smoothie. The minute I took a bite of her sandwich, I instantly became her fan. I never in my life had such a fluffy egg!! Everything about the sandwich was PERFECT! Every bite I took, I got more and more lost in the fluffiness of the egg and it had the perfect portion of the meat as well! I went back the day after to get the Spinach and Egg sandwich and it was equally as good.   12 dollars for a sandwich is little pricey BUT it is worth every penny. I cannot wait to try allll her restaurants!",

There's a retail area with everything a fan of Giada could desire to purchase, a full bar with hightop seating, and a to-go counter where you can order an espresso, pastries, and a few other light bites. It's a 3-fer!   I ordered an almond milk latte, ham and cheese croissant, and grabbed a banana. Last minute add-on was the lemon ricotta cookies. The almond milk latte was creamy and rich but I wasn't a fan of the croissant. Although it was flaky and buttery, the cheese was goat #notafan and the fillings were small in comparison to the size of the pastry. The real winners were those cookies. As an LV local, I would make a trip back for those pronto!   See what I did there?",

I got the $15 Lobster Roll that's already prepped in their refrigerated section. And it's literally one of the most delicious lobster rolls I've had. I seriously couldn't believe how fresh the flavors were.  They have hot and cold sandwiches and salads made to order. Also displayed is a great selection of pastries.  Folks also stop in here for a more Giada-styled coffees and lattes.  If you're attending a conference at the convention center and need a quick bite. Stop by here. Service is highly efficient as well.",

In my opinion, the food, service, location, and vibe is hands-down the best at Giada.  I love this place.  Their meat and cheese appetizer is a great variety, and decently well priced.  They have a changing menu, that always has a great pasta dish (the Cheese wheel is unique and worth the 64$ cost.. it's for two, and is awesome.  Add some crushed red pepper tho!). The Cavatelli is also amazing, and has a light pesto sauce.  Small portion, but so tasty.   And for lunch I recommend the lemon and pesto panini.  The chef really cares, and even came to our table last trip to make sure our order was correct (I miscommunicated a special order...) and was incredibly sincere.  The staff is friendly, not pretentious, and the location is unbeatable.  Get there early for a table with a view of the fountains.   Keep up the great job, Giadas.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch while at a work conference.  Note:  this is not Giada's full-service restaurant - it's the fast food spot.  I'm pretty sure that place will be a much different experience than mine in terms of food.    Summary:  For the money, you can have a better meal.  My guess is Giada would tell you to try the full-service restaurant.  Ambience:  pretty cool - modern and bright with a splash of color - it's a nice departure from the rest of the Caesar's aesthetic.  Having the wine bar next door is a nice touch.  Service:  it's more fast-foody (go through a line), but the food looks pretty great.  The service was friendly but fast-foody, nothing bad, but nothing to really write home about.    I had the steak with roasted vegetables.  Here's what threw me off: -They heat up the meat in fancy microwaves, and it came out well-done.  If that was a possibility, I wish I had a chance to specify medium rare.  The roasted veggies were cold...but they're roasted, shouldn't they be hot?  And the food was served in plastic containers (even though it wasn't to-go).  None of this is a problem if I'm spending $10-15...but this was a $45 meal.  For dessert, I had the cheesecake cannoli (they have a gelato cannoli option).  This was well executed for my taste - not too cream-cheesy, the shell was not too thick...nicely balanced.  I also bought some cookies for later...which weren't bad either (the cannoli is the better buy).  This is a restaurant where you walk away feeling like you spent more money than you should have.  Your head will appreciate that it's fresh ingredients, but your taste buds may walk away confused.  It may be just my dish - try the salmon or chicken.  I'd probably save the steak meat for actual steak joints.",

Being the Food Network Chef stalker I am, I wasn't going to pass up a snack here so hopped in line to grab a sandwich and a side of veggies haha.  I ordered a ham, gruyere and apple panini with a side grilled vegetables. The staff was nice and prepared the food no less than five minutes. There were lots of tables up for grabs so my friends and I quickly picked one and began munching.   I really enjoyed the apple and ham combination. The gruyere was present but didn't stand out as much as other ingredients. It's also worth noting the panini has a delicious mustard sauce that also works well with the ham and apples. The grilled veggies had a nice charred flavor and tasted fresh. So fresh that the onion brings tears when eating them. Throw those bad boys back on the grill! LOL...I wouldn't recommend eating the onions alone unless you enjoy the strong flavor and burn but cutting small pieces to eat with the rest of the veggies works just fine.   If you're looking for a hefty meal then I recommend looking elsewhere but if you're looking for a small decent lunch in Caesars, Pronto is the spot. The flavors of what I ordered is enough to prompt another visit if I'm passing through. Eyeing the lobster roll and curried chicken panini for next time.   Lunch 2/11/2018",

    "text": "You may have some sticker shock when you first walk up to Pronto.   But, when you remember that this is a quick joint in a large hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, the prices are not that crazy.  They are akin to airport prices.  So, not cheap (for example, a small cup of berries is $10), but given that you are a captive audience and are either hungry or thirsty, this joint gets the job done fairly quickly and painlessly.  I would say overall it is a 3 star joint.  I am bumping it up a star to 4 because the employees went above and beyond to make me something specific.  I like my fruit smoothies a certain way, and when I travel it is never easy for places to get it right.  I know that I am being a bit unreasonable requesting things be done so precisely, but I am nice about it and a good tipper, so I think that makes up for the annoyance.  Also, if a place can't get it done, I understand.  Pronto's employees were awesome, instead of simply refusing my request and instructing me to order one of the smoothies off the menu or order nothing, they worked with me and put together a smoothie that is pretty close to what I make for myself at home.  One of the women even went to check if they had more blueberries in the kitchen.    This level of service is not always found at quick places like Pronto, and it was appreciated.  Next time I am at Caesars I will definitely be back.",

Then when shown a picture of the board she claims they raised the price and the manager called to have the board changed but they haven't changed it yet...so wrong! watch for your receipts, otherwise you're being cheated everywhere! :(",

I loved how there was a display of the items in front of you so you could actually see what you're getting! Super helpful for those who are trying to decide between items!   The cashier was very helpful in guiding us towards a yummy smoothie. Pineapple kale, I believe it was, was surprisingly very refreshing and not overly \"green\". Next visit, I'll try her other recommendation - Almond Date. I also got a small cup of pesto pasta salad - super fresh and tasty. Loved the chunks of mozzarella! And when in Vegas, a coffee at any hour is acceptable. The iced latte was nothing over the top, but it was definitely enjoyable after I added a little agave to it.   It's definitely a nice place to grab a snack while you wait for the buffet. You can see the TVs from the bar and people watch! As with everything on the Vegas Strip, keep in mind that a small snack can still be pretty pricey.",

I had low expectations but was pleased to discover that Pronto delivers on more than just convenience.  The Tuscan Steak entree with potatoes as the side over-delivered on both quality and quantity for the price. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the potatoes were juicy without being greasy. The complimentary cookies with Yelp check-in were light and moist, with just enough lemon to be zesty but not overpowering.   It's so rare that an in-casino quick service restaurant provides sitdown quality food at fair prices, so Giada, I salute you.",

I didn't try any of the food options there but I did get a table in the seating area.  This cafe is a super casual cafe in the Caesars Palace. There are slot machines located right across from it. It was a nice spot just to hang out in between activities. This is not a sit down restaurant, so as long as you are aware of that, I think this place is great! Super cute and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Giada also has products that you can buy as a souvineer as well. As a Vegas native, I would not go out of my way to come to this cafe. BUT if I was visiting and located on the strip, I would come out of my way to check it out for the ambiance and well of course, Giada.",

If you can get past paying $50 for two sandwiches, hash browns, and 2 large coffees (or, as the case may be, 2 glasses of wine), it's actually really good. Both times there was a line to order breakfast but it moved fairly quickly and the people at the counter and registers were polite and patient. The bartender was also cordial and took the time to explain to my husband and I the region of Italy that our wine was from.   The entire restaurant opens to one of the main drags inside Caesars, which makes for good people watching. Portion sizes for the food were decent.  I would knock off 1/2 a star for being overpriced, but then you could say the same thing for just about any other place on the Strip. So 5 stars it is.",

Whilst I know its new the process from ordering to food delivery is awful resulting in missed orders, inaccurate orders, missing items and angry customer after angry customer. I ordered 4 times from here over 3 days and EVERY time they got the orders wrong or missed items. Whilst waiting (too long) I also witnessed dozens of other customers getting the wrong orders or their orders being completely forgotten.   The process needs to change completely....  - They need more people making Paninis  - The order station needs to be closer to the start (so the non english speaking chinese can point to what they want) - They need someone collating orders (as if you order salad it comes from a different section than sandwiches).  - The same person should be collating and checking orders (at least temporarily until they sort themselves out)  The issue is everyone has their station, but NO ONE is pulling it all together.  The issues I witnessed existed whether there was 1 person waiting or 20. Its a fundamental process issue.",

I loved her ricotta lemon cookies and I also bought her nougant. I didn't open the nougant until I came to my room. I looked at it and relized it was old and expired. I purchased two packs. Please people employee check the dates before you sell me something old to eat. I had to throw them away. It also tasted old. It expired on 2/28/2018 and I purchased it on  3/3/2018.

Well to start I am not going to hold back. The service sucked I was informed by the sandwich maker that due to my order being keyed into the register wrong I had to eat the sandwich and not the fratta we ordered. I informed him we want we ordered and replied take it up with cashier. After waiting 20 minutes to clear up the mess out comes the fratta.  I order a lobster roll which was to have chunks of lobster meat. Well again disappointed the lobster meat was shredded and was a tiny portion as you can see in the photo. The lobster roll was $15 way over priced even for Las Vegas standards. The photo indicates that the plastic knife was larger than the $15 shredded lobster disaster Giada is serving. We couldn't find a fork and when I asked for one I was told when they get a chance someone would fill the empty fork bins. I was told are their spoons and if so use those for now. The restaurant was not busy and now I can see why.  Do not try this establishment unless every other restaurant is closed and the food was free. So disappointed tell your friends to not waste their money or their time.",

I found myself utterly dissatisfied much like a wife of a man with no libido. Reservations for 11:30 am. Seated at 1 PM. I arrived to a bar filled with fruit flies and shrimp flies. Room temperature shrimp and 65 degree medium rare beef. I had to stare into the eyes of very sad friends who felt I had let them down with my selection. Bottomless mimosas were in fact bottomful. Manager did not know what to do with his hands. Hostess was also bus boy. I wish I had more hands, so i give this establishment 4 thumbs down. The milk has indeed gone bad. Reluctantly yours... just a guy in vegas",

I went for the weekend brunch and it couldn't have been any worse. I had a reservation and arrived 10 minutes early. I checked in and didn't end up getting seated until about 10 minutes after my reservation time. They advertise online that they have a variety of fresh squeezed juices and this was one of the main reasons why I went here with my father. I asked what fresh squeezed juices they have and she told me that they have none. I inquired about it and she said they haven't had fresh squeezed juices for awhile and the only juice they have is orange juice but they don't squeeze the oranges and it's bottled. I order an orange juice and an espresso. After 10 minutes the drinks never arrived and another waitress ended up bringing me orange juice. The espresso arrived eventually and was fine. I then try an omelet and some of the meats and other hot food. Everything was cold except for the made to order omelet. Other tables around me were complaining and I heard one lady tell the waitress that this was the worst experience she's ever had in Vegas. She said she ordered a water 2 times and never got it. My waitress was no where to be seen most of the time and a waitress from another section had to step in and get drinks for us and the table next to us. She was more helpful than our actual waitress. After being lured in by their Falsely advertised fresh squeezed juices, being served cold food, and receiving awful service I can honestly say this was the worst dining experience I've had in Las Vegas by far. People all around me were complaining about how awful things were. Very disappointing experience. Avoid this place and dine elsewhere!",

Today was the first day they opened after an expansion apparently ... they didn't bring enough staff ... so drinks came out much later than you came back to the table with your food. The Saturday Sunday brunch is basically self serve so .. 90% of the food is cold or room temperature ...  the only thing hot was omelet ...  all the meat is room temp ..  also bc it's self serve you get a new plate every time you come up .. they didn't clear our plates ... so imagine a small 2 top with 4-5 plates on it ...  it wasn't great ... I don't know even if they improved these things if I would come back ...",

I bought it because I planned to take here May 4. After purchasing the Groupon it prompts to call and make reservations. The number is the direct number to Cesar's palace and then someone directs you to the restaurant. After a few rings it goes back to the directory. I am then told that they are closed for remodeling and won't reopen until May 4. At this point I am upset and decide well I'll just reschedule her bday brunch to Sunday May 5. Easy fix. But now the problem is how do I make a reservation? I decided to call today, may 4 when they are supposedly reopening according to their website and also the Cesar's directory person. Come to find out after they looked up more info that they will not be open until May 11! I can't get a hold of the restaurant and the information given isn't consistent. I am beyond upset because now I have spent $60 on a Groupon is can't even use for my friends bday which I have rescheduled twice. To top it off the coupon expires on May 31 but since they are closed this week I am limited to only one weekend to use it because you can't use it Mother's Day. It's really bs. Don't sell a Groupon if your establishment isn't even open!!!",

I don't think I've ever been asked to pay for tap water with a food purchase.  Edit: in response to the manager's comment, I was told that all tap water had a charge.  If that's not your policy, maybe a refresher training for the staff is in order.",

And we're huge fans of yours. The glow is tarnished. Maybe less time on TV and a bit more in your restaurants would be a good thing?   Those free cookies had better be good.  Good news: the line moves quickly, efficiently, and the clerks are very nice.  But, gee whiz, I miss Payard.  PRO TIP: EATERS OF RAINBOW CAKE, DO NOT BE ALARMED THE NEXT DAY.

Sadly, the best compliment I can give this place is that it's conveniently located next to Caesars' conference center.  None of the food was bad, but none of the food was particularly good either. And considering how expensive this \"upscale cafeteria\" is, and considering it now carries Giada's name, I expected better. The frittata tasted like the kind of egg dish I could find at just about any other 24 hour cafe on The Strip, and the orange juice tasted like a mid-range grocery store brand.  At least the coffee was good, but even that tasted close to what I could have found at a Coffee Bean or Peet's. I really wanted to like this place, I truly did. And while I don't hate it by any stretch, I'm just left lukewarm (kind of like my food there).",

    "text": "I am seriously hoping that Giada was just paid to use her name and isn't involved in any aspect of this restaurant. We got the pesto grilled cheese sandwich and the free lemon ricotta cookies . The cookies look amazing in the package but after one bite from two different people we ended up throwing them away. The lemon flavor doesn't taste like fresh lemon but an artificial flavoring. On to the sandwich . Surely you can't mess up grilled cheese right? Wrong! This sandwich had bland pesto and the same weird Leon taste.     This restaurant has ample seating and a cheerful atmosphere . We were there during a convention and I never saw but a few people sitting . I think it was a huge mistake to close Payard (which was always packed) for this restaurant.     I feel like I must say that I love the Giada restaurant at the Cromwell and can't believe that two restaurants owned by the same person are at such opposite ends of the food spectrum in regards to taste.",

Whether it's a healthy salad or a scoop of gelato, it's a great place to take a break. The staff is very friendly and let us sample all of the gelato before settling on a favorite. The store has some cute items as well for Giada fans and the home chef.",

The sandwich was very bland and a breakfast sandwich from McDonalds would have been more tasteful and appealing. It's a convenient stop and very cute, but I don't think I'll order there again. A small coffee was $5...I'd rather go to Starbucks (go to Starbucks and order a venti iced cinnamon macchiato with coconut milk mmmmmm or go to a 7 Eleven for just as good of a coffee).   Pronto: please add salsa or hot sauce to your condiment section. Your sammies need a little extra flavor. Maybe some Taco Bell fire sauce?",

Didn't get seated till 11:45. Had to wait while your maitre 'd had to clean the table by herself!! I watched while your servers were \"washing and drying the dishes and glasses by hand. Seems pretty unsanitary to me after they have been picking up dirty dishes off tables   Surely you can afford a dishwasher! Service was sooooo slow. Hated that we sat so close to other patrons. Also, did not like that the restaurant was so open. All the people walking through the casino we're going by the food areas smoking, coughing and breathing on the buffet items. Ugh, all I thought of was germs spreading on my food. Not appetizing at all. The lady making omelettes also  was the carver. Really spread thin and frazzled. I was seated on the bench side of the table and almost needed a booster seat, because the table was so high. Did not like the fact that the breads were sitting out and dried out. Overpriced for the selections. I'm so disappointed, Giada. I think this about covers it!! Truly a BIG disappointment and we can't recommend your restaurant to anyone. The worst part of this is that our daughter purchased this for my husband as a Father's Day gift through Travelzoo. She was so excited because we all love watching your shows. I was sad to tell her it was not worth the money she works hard for  I hope you can make some necessary changes. We won't be back. PS the signs by the food were written so small that I had no idea what they were!! Additionally, some of the items had NO signage. You can do better than this!!!",

I got myself the chocolate chip cookies (which taste ok - really can't mess up cookies) and a cappuccino. Mind you, the cappuccino is $6 for a VERY small cup. I've been to Italy so I know that it's not supposed to be in a big cup anyways but it was atrocious! It tasted horrible!! Literally tasted like dirt and water. I normally don't send things back but I stood back in line as the cashiers slowly rang other customers up. I told her that the cappuccino was not what I expected so I replaced it with a Latte instead. The cashier gave me attitude and reluctantly made me a latte (which by the way, was not any better). Their attitude is more bitter than their coffee! Next time, I'll go to Starbucks, thanks!",

Our server was very friendly, but took a long time to bring us drinks, think she had way too many tables, but she always kept a smile on her face.  The food was delicious, not an extensive selection as at other buffets, but the foods offered were very high quality.  Our server came by only twice, to take our drink order and to bring it, didn't come to offer refills (we would have liked water or different drinks) and we had to go to the bar to ask her for our bill.  Will definitely come back, because the food and the ambiance were amazing, but mgmt needs to hire more staff to service guests.",

The problem here is that while the quality is above average, it is not off the charts and the price is crazy high.  $16.95 for what is essentially half a sandwich at any normal restaurant is just too much.  Also, we got our food to go and the soup lid was only half on, resulting in a bag with about 1/4 of the soup in it.  Thus, while food was reasonably good, I cannot in any way recommend this from a value context.",

Food was all cold except for the made to order omelettes. We were eating it before we even had our drink order in.  One server tending to tables, no manager present. Chef at carving station continued to leave the station causing the chef making the omelettes to pop over and carve meat. Many guests were very upset.  Food was mediocre. waitress came up and served us our drinks apologizing for the wait. The only plus were the lemon ricotta cookies!  Sorry this is not recommended:(",

They do run out of items, so go earlier in the day.  We got a slice of the chocolate cake and the rainbow cake in the colors of the Italian flag. Giada herself is Italian. We also got the lemon ricotta cookies. They come three in a bag.  The chocolate cake was dry and not too much flavor. The cookies were much too sweet. And I love sweet stuff! The rainbow cake was the best. So light and airy and tasted like almond cake. Just amazing. I would return just for that cake!",

We were both starving, and nothing in the hotel except Pronto was open. We each ordered a panini (which ones, I can't recall) and were pretty satisfied. They were pretty large portions, so we definitely could have just split one. What I remember most vividly, however, is how delicious the hash browns were when we stopped for a quick breakfast the next morning. I could have eaten them all day--they were crispy and so full of flavor! I also appreciated that my favorite candy just happened to be at the cash register (raspberry and blackberry gummies). Overall, this is a great little place to hit before you head out on The Strip!",

You first stand in line with one register where you order food. Then you go to a second set of registers where you pay. Not sure I understand this system where you order at one register and pay at a secondary of registers. The food was good, but not exceptional. May be I had higher expectations before going in.",

My friend and I arrived at a busy time with a crazy hacker convention going on at one of the hotel's meeting rooms. So the crowd made for a busy crowded rushed experience. I didn't like being crowded, but the food here looks delicious! There's pizza, pasta, salads, sandwiches/paninis, custom order small meal plate w/chicken, fish, or veggie. There's also a coffee/espresso bar, gelato, and shave ice menu. I ordered a small hot plate w/roasted broccolini, and cheesy potatoes. It was delicious! I also grabbed a bag of plain kettle chips, and a bottle of acqua panna water. I also made room for dessert. The staff was kind enough to let me sit down and finish my meal, then order my gelato afterwards. All I had to do was show my receipt of purchase and pick out my gelato flavors. I got the nutella stracciatella & pistachio flavored gelatos!! The flavors did not disappoint!! I recommend them both! I would return again. And I definitely recommend going here. The food was fresh, tasty, and healthy sized portions. The main thing that bummed me out was that they didn't have the lobster roll sandwich available! I really wanted to visit here for the lobster roll & gelato. Oh well next time. I'll be back Pronto!!",

Pronto is located at the Caesars Hotel.  Came to check out the famous lemon ricotta cookies and coffee.  Which by the way you can check in on Yelp and get you the ricotta cookies for free!  The cookies were moist so moist and went well with the beautiful cup of coffee.    Staff was friendly and courteous.  Especially the lady that helped me at the gift shop.  She saw I was buying a lot of paraphernalia and was kind enough to bubble wrap my breakables for the plane ride home.      Didn't get to buy the whole store so I will be back...until next time Pronto!  Hahahahaha!",

Did I mention it was like $20 for what is essentially gas station food? What a joke. I would be embarrassed to put my name on this.",

Giada is one of my favorite Food Network stars so when I found out they offer a brunch on the weekends I knew I had to give it a whirl.    So much to say but the first word that comes to mind is AMAZING!!!  Bottomless mimosas,cappuccino,lattes, juices and much more.  Then you add the food there is no going wrong here at all, the staff is super nice ( a little slow on the drinks but really not an issue)   After you finish you can do a little shopping, she has so many cute thing that I couldn't resist picking up a few things before I left!  Must try the kale omelet, lemon ricotta cookies, and of course all the pastas she had..  We will be back!!!",

Female bartender reply \"I don't do table service\".. flatly I might add. Hmmm... okay, strike one.  2. Female bartender gave me a taste of wine which was opposite of what I told her I like. Then I asked \"what about this one? May I try it?\" Female bartender reply \"No\" flatly again. Nothing else, just \"No\"  3. I ordered Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppers & Grilled Long Stemmed Artichokes. Female bartender reply \"We are out\"... as I'm going to open my mouth to say my next options, Female bartender says \"Let me tell you what we do have\". List was short.. maybe 7 items out of 14 (so half of the menu was NOT available).   UPDATE... I'm writing this as I sit here. My muffuletta is taking a while so Female bartender comes over and brings a choice of 3 bags of chips... apologizes it's taking so long and offered one of the 3 bags to me. That was nice of her.. so 1/2 a star more.    My muffuletta is now here... going to enjoy this I hope!",

CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE If you like cookie dough and dark chocolate without being overly sweet you may just have found what you are looking for. While it is not to my personal taste the use of bread flour adds a doughy flavor and texture thus making the cookie more of a soft baked cookie. The  dark chocolate flavor bitterness and richness comes through without a contrasting sweetness which may be liked by those looking for that in their flavor profile. If you are not into cookie dough or would like a bit more sweetness to mellow out or contrast the sharp flavor of the chocolate this one may not be for you.   LEMON RICOTTA WITH LEMON GLAZE COOKIES. This cookie is on the more sweeter side and could go well with a nice tea with milk. The sweetness mainly comes from the glaze which also has a lemon flavor accenting it. The soft cookie may have some lemon rind in it however the sweet and lemony glaze overwhelms the cookie altogether. By itself the cookie lacks balance between the cookie and the glaze. This can be overly sweet for some thus the recommendation of a warm drink should help round out the sweetness. Perhaps even the selection of a gelato to make your personal mini ice cream sandwich would be something to try.  OVERALL  It was a pleasant to taste the treats and meet the kind staff at this location. The atmosphere and location gives you a chance to talk and people watch.   For both cookies a warm mocha or tea may help contribute the flavors and  enhance the dining experience.",

The chicken was dry, the broccolini was so hard I couldn't even cut it in half to eat with my plastic knife and the pasta seemed gummy. That saying, the pasta was all I was able to eat. After seeing how picky Giada can be with other chefs cooking, I must say I was surprised at the food I received.  On a plus side, there was plenty of food served for the price. The gelato was delicious.  Would not order another meal there and I'm returning to Caesars next year.",

When I'm paying $45 per person plus beverages and tip, I expect exceptional service.

My wife and I decided to have a quick dinner in the room while watching the VGKs' play the Capitals in the opening game of the Stanley Cup playoffs.  Pronto it was as we were able to walk down from the Augustus Tower at Caesars, order, get our meals and be back in the room without missing any of the game during the break between the 2nd and 3rd period.    Wife had the frittata and I had the mixed grill with steak, grilled vegetables and caprese.  We were both pleasantly surprised with the quality and generous portions.  My sliced flank steak was quite flavorful and the mixed veggies (asparagus, onion, red and yellow peppers portabella mushroom exceeded my expectations.  Might have just been my lucky day but the cherry tomato halves in the caprese may have been the sweetest I have had in many years.  The steak had great flavor and was relatively tender and given that it was reheated wasn't much past medium rare.  Contrary to other reviews we found the counter staff to be exceptionally pleasant and efficient.  We've eaten several times at Giada's at the Cromwell and actually feel that Pronto offers a better value.  Granted, you are eating out of a plastic to-go container with plastic cutlery but put my order on a white plate and have it served to me and I would be glad to pay more than double the $16 it cost at Pronto.  We'll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings.  Recommended!",

Got half way through the salad and knew something was off. No dressing. Went back and was told the cashier knows to hand that out at purchase. It's 1:00 pm, really wouldn't mind having a glass of wine with lunch. Oh, but the wine bar is not open. Asked several employees and none seem to know when it opens. 11:00, 3:00, not sure, haven't seen the bartender, we were told. Sorry, won't come back.",

The paninis are excellent - recommend the ham, gruyere & apple (yes Apple!) or the turkey, bacon and avocado. I don't even like bacon and I really enjoyed this sandwich. The coffee is fantastic. I don't know what it is about it but I don't need to add creamer or sugar or anything! The desserts are worth every calorie, especially the cookies!

It was a ridiculous amount of $ to purchase the Keurig kit for our hotel room ($15) so Giada's Pronto was our solution. It was simple enough to order. I went to the express coffee line. I ordered my mom the house coffee ($5), and iced mocha ($7) and a chocolate croissant (that had some fancy name) ($6), making our grand total $19. The bonus was checking into Yelp, which in return got me 3 of Giada's famous lemon ricotta cookies for free. The coffee/mocha were very strong and appreciated. The warmed croissant had a fair amount of chocolate. The cookies were a tad bit too sweet (even for this sweet tooth) and halfsies were shared between my mom and I. The reason for 3 stars versus 4 was the price. However, I guess it's expected, with the celebrity chef name and location on The Strip. I would go here again and would try something different next time around.",

The cashier didn't seem to care that I paid $8 for an americano that I couldn't even drink. The egg sandwich with pancetta was pretty much inedible and all the cheese and pancetta were at the bottom of the packaging and not on the actual sandwich. I would think she would have more control over her product since her name is on it .  The one saving grace were the lemon ricotta cookies - those were delicious.",

We were on a short trip to Vegas from Los Angeles. We discussed stopping to get a bite to eat during our 3 and a half hour drive. It was my idea to try Pronto because the Instagram posts and I had missed it on my last visit to Vegas. We got into Vegas and drove straight to Caesar's. We parked in the wrong valet and did the long trek to the spot where the much awaited experience of one of Giada's creations was. Once we arrived our excitement quickly diminished as we saw the foods offered. We tried to stay positive as our eyes were disappointed with what we saw. Oh and did I mention, two people in our 5 person group are from Naples, Italy We ordered, and paid $95.00 for 2-sandwiches, 1-bag of chips, 1-lemon cake, 1- roasted potatoes, 1-cup of pesto pasta, 1-small side of olives and 2 sodas and a cappuccino. The pricing was absurdly disappointing but not even close to the disappointment of the food! The only good food choices were the kettle chips and the lemon cake. The pasta had no flavor, the sandwiches were just ok. The potatoes were just okay. Wasn't worth the money but more importantly this place isn't a good representation of Giada and that's what was most discouraging. Will never return to this food place. And I'm sad.",

You cant beat a giant bowl of soup and in house made rustic bread. And its only $6. What a deal. As for dessert... mascarpone cheesecake are huge for6.

Literally, it smells so good as you walk by and the natural lighting transports you to a lovely place.  We stopped for a snack of gelato and we can't ever pass up trying a tomato soup.  We got their signature Pomodoro Meatball soup, and the Coconut mint chocolate chip Gelato.  We didn't expect the wham of goodness that was coming!!    First of all, the soup.  They had fresh Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil atop straight, fresh pomodoro soup.  No cream, no fuss, just a perfect acidic balance of tomatoes.  Then there were these mini meatballs the size of grapes that were little surprises.  This soup was succulent.  So delicious!  But paired with gelato, oh boy.  The Gelato was the biggest surprise for us.  This was THE best gelato we've had and let me tell you why.  The flavor profile of mint and coconut with a light vanilla based cream was divine.  But the Star was the abundance of very thin, small, dark chocolate flakes that added a crunch that was so easy to bite into.  We went back later because the temptation was too strong!  So good!   But here's the kick.  These two items together were perfectly harmonious and for sure made us say Mmmmmmm way too many times!  I'd trample through a dozen people to get to this experience again!  Okay, maybe I'm being dramatic but it was that good!",

Since the property is so big, just follow the signs for the buffet and it's right next door.  We had a hard time deciding, but ultimate ended up getting a few items to experience a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed the turkey, avocado and bacon panini - there was a nice sauce on it that really nailed it for me. It's a little on the pricier side, but it will leave you feeling satisfied, but not overly stuffed. The pastas were great, the Antipasto Pasta Salad was the favorite because we're big fans of the pesto and we really enjoyed the margarita pizza, too!  Make sure you check-in on the Yelp app as you'll get some of the best Lemon Ricotta Cookies you've ever had. I was about to buy some before noticing the sign, but I'd happily pay money for these again. Not only are they tangy from the citrus, they're light, airy and make you want to lick your fingers when you're done.  We'll definitely be back, especially for one of their cocktails and other sandwiches!",

    "text": "I had purchased a couple of the brunch with unlimited mimosas Groupon's for Pronto by Giada knowing that my mom, sister, and I would be spending the majority of our time in Caesar's Palace during our family girls trip last month. The reviews are fairly average so I wasn't totally sure what to expect other than it not being one of the big, fancy Vegas buffet's.   I was thrilled to find that it was located right at the bottom of the elevators to our room, so we were not rushed to make it to our 10:00am reservation on Saturday morning. Speaking of, I'd definitely recommend a reservation. It's very small and it was quite full on a Saturday. They were very accommodating with my mom's scooter as I had put that on our reservation notes, so they had the perfect table set up for us that she was able to park it in a niche right next to our table.   As aforementioned, this is by no means a huge buffet, but I am surprised by the poorer reviews on here. We actually all thought it was a nice break from the craziness that is Vegas. It was quiet, relaxing, and honestly just the perfect mellow morning breakfast. There isn't an enormous amount of options, but there is an omelet station with plenty of ingredients to choose from, a meat station in which you can get slices of turkey, ham, and/or roast beef, breakfast potatoes, bacon, quiche, a pastry bar, a fruit bar, and a dessert bar. The chef cooking our omelets was great. They only have bacon and ham as meat options for the omelets, but I do not eat pork so he suggested taking a small slice of the roasted turkey from the other bar and chopped it up to cook in my omelet. It was delicious! The three of us left stuffed, despite the \"lack of options\" as people have said. Our mimosa's were always full and my mom's coffee always hot.   In fact, we liked Pronto by Giada so much, we ended up going back for the breakfast buffet again on Sunday. They did not have any reservations available when I looked Saturday night, but they were able to squeeze us in a smaller table. The waitress and the omelet chef remembered us and made us feel very welcomed back!   Next time I stay in Caesar's Palace, I will absolutely be keeping an eye out for the Pronto by Giada Travelocity or Groupon deals!",

    "text": "Genuine love and warmth are words that I would use to describe this beautiful food concept. When I think of really good food Italian cuisine comes to for thought. The idea of delivering delicious \"real\" food was the fruition of the chef who made this happen.  Italian cuisine evokes a place that is comforting it wraps one up in that favorite blanket and holds them close. It is a feeling of closeness and tenderness that I feel as we got close to this cafe.   Located in Caesars Palace as you come through the main entrance where check in is located for hotel guests; take the first hallway all the way around (not towards Omni, the other way) it's on the right. It's set up cafe style as I said earlier, while many patrons were stopping by for real good food to go, some opt to stay as we did!   As I approached Pronto I was blown away by all of the precious detail that was included in the dining room decor, plus the wonderful selection of delicious choices and flavors of beverages just to start with. Let's start in the lobby, while it's not the biggest place to sit, it's size is comparable to a Starbucks lobby is anywhere USA. The chairs and tables are decorated in a beautiful pattern with bright orange. It screams luxury and then we must sit and see if the seat is just as comfortable as it should be. Coziness achieved the seats are ready for one to enjoy your favorite app or instagram posting, game with a cappuccino or glass of wine.   Peace even if just for a minute or too is hard to find in Las Vegas, especially inside one of the busiest hotels in the world. Pronto is tucked in the back of Caesars with very little if not any gambling casino games to destroy your zen while sipping cappuccino trying to achieve Nirvana! The chairs and booth seats are all comfy just waiting for you to stop by! As I sat here I enjoyed the satisfaction of silence here. The ambiance of the place that is was created is utter repose and a fantastic escape from the casino and noise.   While I was browsing the food, the many choices it's way too hard to choose from. If you enjoy sparkling water and upscale luxury dining with having not to make a reservation this is the place to visit. They are over stocked with some of my favorites such as Fentimans Rose Lemonade or Pellegrino Sparkling Water. The food selection is as abundant as their beverage selection. The line is set up where you start at one end and grab and go what you need as you move in line. The selection of food behind the counter is such items as simple sandwiches, pasta, Italian favorites to make one feel good and happy with delicious flavors filling them up. As one nears the register the gelato is the last delicious item and oh so tempting!   As I paid for my sandwich, cheesecake, and sparkling water I am elated with the speed and quality of the front counter service. The cashiers are speedy and very professional. They smile and are so very warm. It's nice to have a cashier that's happy while they are working and interacting with their fellow employees! The crew of Pronto are amazing! Thumbs up to some of the best team work that I have seen in some time . While I was paying for my purchases the manager was restocking the water, she wished me a blessed day without me even speaking to her. This is the kind of presence of team work that should be the blueprint for every company. When the crew and customers are happy then it's smooth sailing. Cruise in and come see how a proper ship is run!  Desert is always first or at least a bite! Wanting to try the cheesecake so much I opened the container and inserted the fork. Here we go real Italian cheesecake. The bite of the cheesecake was not good enough to make a decision if it was good; it took three bites. Yes, the cheesecake here is a wonderful winner! The cheese is so smooth and delectable. I'm not much for crust, but the graham crackers were delicious with perfect balance to the cheesecake pairing together. The sandwich that I had was a fantastic wonder of salami, pepperoni, and provolone cheese served warmed. The sensation from the cheesecake was still filling me with warm fuzzy joy! The sandwich was awesome but compared to the cheesecake it does not hold up. Eventually, I will try everything on the menu.   Now with my visit coming to a close I want to thank Pronto for the free Yelp check in they provide to us. The check in was a fantastic lemon cookie with three in a package. These lemon cookies are no joke, really they are amazing; especially with sparking wine! When you need just a minute to yourself this is the bliss you are seeking! Come and enjoy yourself with real food that is delicious and delivered in a really ready way; Pronto!!",

We had sat at the bar and I had ordered the Bellissimo cocktail and it was to die for! I highly recommend this drink if you like fruity cocktails. The Bellissimo cocktail is listed on the menu under Giada's favorites.   The cocktail was made with the following ingredients: Cruzan, aperol, simple syrup, freshly squeezed lemon juice, and muddled strawberries and basil. The value of the cocktail was $14. I found the price decent for being in a high end Las Vegas hotel.   Our server was very sweet and gave some wonderful tips of what to do and sight see in Las Vegas! I was pleased with the service, friendly staff, and the yummy cocktail. Thank you for a great experience! We will be definitely coming back soon!",

Check in on Yelp will give you a small package of 3 lemon ricotta cookies.  We shared a cheese danish, $6. It was really good, light and not overly sweet. Even Hubby likes it.  I love her shows but she makes tiny bites of food and if I were her guest, I'd starve. Lemon, ricotta cheese, tomatoes, veggies are some of the mainstays used in her cooking.  The menu here offer sandwiches, coffees, sides and desserts. It's a very casual place.  I do miss the former choc/pastry chef that used to occupy this space. But Pronto offers a bigger variety of food.",

Super disappointing for the price. Guess they figure a celebrity chef can warrant 2x an expected price?",

The amount of food and quality of food does not match anything that I've had yet so far in Las Vegas.  I live in Las Vegas, and I want to make sure any Saturday or Sunday that I am vailable from 9 AM to 1 PM that I make this a routine brunch.  The egg white oneket that the Chef madexto order for me was absolutely divine! Do not miss the cranberry turkey as it is moist and delicious and the sauce provided is out of this world.  The desserts to say the least are scrumptious.  In particular, I'm a big fan of the lemon cake as well as the cheesecake and multicolored Neapolitan cake.",

The only good hot food was the omelet bar. We had to summoned a waitress to get drinks.

One type was graced with chocolate chips, another with pistachio and the last with what appeared to be cherry flavored. It took serious restraint not to leave with the pistachio one! In addition to redeeming the free cookie offer, I purchased a small coffee. $6.48, YIKES! When in Vegas.... The coffee condiment bar was neat and well organized. I was pleased to see cinnamon was an option. The coffee was good and paired well with the cookies. The venue itself was very clean and the desserts and pastries were well organized in pristine cases. Finally, our cashier was very personable. I would definitely return. I encourage fellow Yelpers to take advantage of the check-in offer. I almost forgot! The gelato bar features gelato cannolis!

I wonder how often she stops by to check the quality of the food being served at her namesake spots. I wrote another review for Giada's at the Cromwell. But this is for the little spot inside Caesar's.   I must say that I didn't try the wine bar section. I stopped by where they had food already prepared. It's called Pronto, and I just wanted something fast for breakfast. I chose the Pancetta and Egg sandwich, added hashbrowns, and also got an orange juice. Plus tax it came out to almost $24. I know it's Vegas casino pricing. But $7 for a cup of orange juice?! The sandwich was very bland and dry. It needed some sauce or a cheese that would add some flavor. I couldn't eat it or the hash brown. I did drink the oj, but because I was thirsty. It was supposedly freshly squeezed, but didn't take particularly great to me.   I would never eat here again. Caesar's has many other options, like the food court that is reasonably priced and much tastier.",

While the Pronto at Wynn Palace is the same name as Pronto by Giada, is it really the same restaurant? Both serve exactly the same stuff with the same furniture. Who knows...  The food here is slightly elevated fast food. If you are in a pinch of something fast, then like the name of the restaurant hints, this is where you want to be. However remember that you're paying ridiculous pricing already here at Caesars. $17 for a sandwich that's pre made and didn't taste that good isn't really good at all. Everything here is expensive, as expected.  Even if you need a coffee, do yourself a favor, go over to Brioche by Guy Savoy. Just a few steps over and much better and cheaper.  Actually, if you want fast food, skip this and walk over to the food court. For the price, Halal Guys or Earl of Sandwich are much better.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon Pronto while wandering through Caesars Palace.  Giada's photos are displayed in the cafe, which was what caught my eye. For those not into celebrity chefs, Giada de Laruentiis is on the Food Network, makes appearances on the Today Show, and is known for Italian cooking.  I had been to Giada's restaurant at the Cromwell several times, which is an absolutely beautiful restaurant, with stunning views of the Strip.  Pronto is more like a cafe, with no views except the inside of the casino, and where you order at the counter and seat yourself.     The lemon ricotta cookies are an Italian classic, and came with a Yelp check-in.  They were delicious! They were topped with a lemon glaze, and the ricotta clearly gave it a nice pillowy cake-like texture.  Ricotta always works wonders in Italian cooking!! Think manicotti, mascarpone, and zeppole.  I'd easily purchase these next time.  However, did you know that the recipe for this is on the Food Network? Yup, you can even make these at home!  I personally prefer the orange flavored version of these Italian cookies, but Giada's were darn good!  I contemplated grabbing a pizza since I've had enjoyable meals at Giada's at the Cromwell, but they didn't look aesthetically appealing to me.    Pronto is super casual.  It's a self-serve spot where you'd grab a sandwich or pizza for lunch there, or get it to go.  However, they just started their buffet brunch ($45.00) this weekend.    As an aside, I've always wondered how or why \"pronto\" got translated into meaning fast or quick in the U.S.  In Italy, it means ready.  For example, Italians answer the phone by saying \"pronto\" instead of \"hello\", which loosely means \"I'm ready\".  Well, I guess Giada is sticking with the well-known American meaning of pronto here, so I will too.  More lemon ricotta cookies please, pronto!",

By the end of the week I bought another two pieces of cake so I could share the experience with my family and friends.  My event ended, so that meant no more easy access to Pronto during lunch.   Buuuut  I was still thinking about chocolate cake . Sooo, yes I drive about 15 miles to buy a piece of chocolate cake when I'm craving it.    5/13/19 Was craving this deliciousness.

I was not impressed with their presentation and portion size for the price. $8 & some change. Ahh what?     I should have at least gotten two scoops of vanilla gelato.   Overall- The espresso with vanilla gelato was good. But when you get to the bottom of the cup with just the espresso, it was strong and bitter tasting. I didn't finish it.  Would I order this again? Probably, hoping I'd get a bit more gelato.",

A genteel chef manned a prime rib station. The prime rib melted off the bone. I went back to that particular station for thirds. The charcuterie board contained all the finest meats and cheeses. I will never forget the prosciutto.  As for the lemon ricotta cookies, I will always savor their memory. Each morsel elevated me to the empyrean heights of everlasting lemon flavor. Giada's recipe for these cookies is a study in culinary perfection. I would eat these cookies by the baker's dozen. Pretty much every reviewer thus far praised the lemon ricotta cookies. These cookies can bring strangers to a meaningful consensus better than some modern political systems. I look forward to more sweet and sour flavors harmonizing on my plate in the not too distant future. At Pronto Giada's, you'll get a lemon...ricotta.  Although I was not paying much attention because of the lemon ricotta cookies, I did notice that Lisa Vanderpump walked by Giada's en route to her Vanderpump Cocktail Garden. The whole event could have been staged, but she has reduced a lot of her reality to reality TV, so what is the difference?  The majority of the women at Giada's switched into fangirl mode, which freed up more space by the table with the lemon ricotta cookies. OMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM. (Lisa looked famous. Good for her.)",

I checked in on Yelp and they delivered the best tasting lemon cookies! Absolutely delicious. Very soft and moist and not super sweet! House Coffee wasn't very strong like Starbucks. But I like it that way. I hate leaving all shaky like I need to run back to my room and do some exercise! Lol  Pastries were heated to the touch and I loved the berry and cheese pastry. 1 Star taken off for the slow service. They forgot my son's bagel and passed it on to the adult standing next to him. I had to go up and demand my son's bagel because the cashier said \"she didn't see him.\" Hence the delay on getting our bagel right away. That's ok but I don't like how they get your bagel from the wall shelf that's been sitting their since 5am or whatever time they open. I'd prefer my bagel from a sealed bag or a glass case.",

My friend went back and told the girl who took my order that I asked for it iced and the girl said \"yeah I know\". She knew the guy made it incorrectly and gave it to us anyway. What the heck? It's one thing if you got it wrong but it's another thing if you purposely gave me the wrong order.  4) I looked at the cups displayed and realized they charged me for a large but they gave me a medium.

For sit down breakfast/brunch/lunch it is a perfect complement to the buffet across the hall.  Here you can get a quick (relatively) meal at a reasonable (Las Vegas reasonable) price.  Fair warning; they manage this by heating premade food for some dishes.  The paninis are cooked to order in normal presses.  They have a reasonable selection but I do not believe you can customize... again they have them assembled prior and just cook them when ordered.  The frittatas are pleasantly surprising! I couldn't see if they were frozen and reheated, premade that morning and reheated, or pre-assembled into wedge shaped containers and flash cooked in an oven; but certainly they weren't made from scratch at the time of my order... it was simply too fast for that.  Same discussion applies to the hash browns.  Which brings up the above comment regarding the coffee... despite not being busy my cappuccino wasn't ready until LONG after my meal was.  Clearly either an issue with understaffing or their process.   Regardless this place is worth a stop for a quick bite to eat if you can't imagine eating a full buffet across the hall!",

I realize there are different places to grab quick bites, but the quality of food is usually lacking. In comes Pronto! I was so excited to hear about Giada's new grab and go restaurant. After trying a few items during different visits (lobster roll, turkey provolone sandwich, and artichoke and tuna sandwich), I was not disappointed! One other time, I decided to splurge at the wine bar (After work, of course, ha) and ordered the Cabernet Sauvignon Blend Quintessa Rutherford. Delicious to say the least! The wine bar is nice for a quick after-work drink with colleagues without all the lounge/bar noise of a traditional bar. Overall, great for people who love quality food on the go!",

    "text": "I made it my mission to make it to Pronto on the day of the Grand Opening. To be honest, I didn't have the highest expectations. Celebrity Chef restaurants can be overrated now. Pronto blew my expectations out of the water.   The design of the restaurant is beautiful. It's comfortable but still classy. There are three sections: quick service cafe, wine bar, and more of a retail store. The retail store was sectioned off for the grand opening, but that's okay. I came for the food.   I had scoured the internet for a menu beforehand, but there wasn't one to be found. I read about the restaurant offering a grilled cheese, so I sought to try that. When I arrived, I was disappointed to see that the grilled cheese had lemon pesto. I am not a fan of lemon, so I passed. I wish it was just pesto. This city is sorely lacking a great chicken pesto sandwich.  All the sandwiches are pre-made, so don't expect to try to subtract any ingredients. I tried. The kind cashier offered to scrape avocado off a sandwich, but I spared her. I ordered the caprese panini.   The panini was the biggest letdown for me here. They add parmesan to the outside of the sandwiches before pressing (which I usually love), but here it seems to only add crunchiness instead of flavor. I would rather they leave this off. I was also surprised to find that the sandwich had arugula instead of basil. I love basil, so this was a big disappointment. The panini also does not have balsamic (which is totally fine with me - I am not a balsamic fan), but this strays from the traditional caprese.   Aside from the panini, I ordered a slew of the baked goods to take home with me. Here are my assessments:  Rosemary pancetta scone - This is a must order. I should have made this my lunch. It's the perfect balance of savory with a slight sweetness.   Chocolate chip cookies - Really solid. They're a touch grainy, but I definitely would still eat them.  Black & White cookies - Pass. These have very little flavor. They're even lacking vanilla.   Blueberry muffin - Easily one of the softest muffins I have ever had. It was like eating a cloud. The blueberry flavor could be a bit stronger, but I still recommend it.   Chocolate Mascarpone Cake - This is a super solid, moist cake packed with chocolate flavor. For me, it was just missing chocolate chips for a bit of texture change.   The prices on the baked goods are more than fair. The sandwich pricing, however, needs a bit of work. They're not worth the high price tag.  Check this place out. The baked goods are definitely worth it. Skip on the sandwiches.",

You get two sides, of which I chose the grilled vegetables and anti pasta pasta salad. The grilled vegetables were cooked perfectly and so scrumptious!!! I wished I had ordered it twice for my sides. The pasta salad seemed to be of average taste. But delicious nonetheless. I finished it off with a grapefruit sorbet, contained 5% alcohol. Sooo refreshing! Highly recommend. The establishment itself was very nice. Clean, open. Lots of seating. Will definitely be coming back here. Thank you, Giada!!",

As an anytime breakfast fiend, I was happy to see an all-day eggs sandwich menu. I ordered the spinach and sausage sandwich. At about 3/4\" thick, the egg was a healthy, satisfying portion, with the bits of sausage cooked into the egg, and the sauteed spinach embedded into the toasted bun. The sandwich also comes with mozzarella cheese--yum! The sandwich satisfied my appetite, and you could feel and taste the quality.  I didn't have any beverages here, but there's coffee, tea and bottled water and juice available, too. I want to come back for some gelato or sorbetto!",

Took it back and exchanged for the ham and cheese ( cashier assured me it didn't have spicy mustard)  Long story short, it did have it, i just tried scraping it off.

The wine bar is a completely different section and was expensive with small pours and not connected to the restaurant so you stand in two lines.

Not only did I see her through the window she waved came out and took a picture with me!!! The food here is fast and accommodating. The venue is absolutely gorgeous and with its bright and bold colors. It's stands out in the palace. Let's not forget to mention that they have a bar around the corner from the lunch and dessert side where they have wine on tap and a full bar. The bartender explained to me that's its on a nitrous system where every time they pull the handle regardless of how long the bottles been there it's like opening a brand new bottle. Awesome!! I'll defiantly be back for some gelato in the summer.",

They fry their stuff in one fryer.  It's pricey and on the strip.  For tourists. You can find better off the strip for less money.  Won't be going back anytime soon. The others in my party did like it to be fair but I can't deal with people who don't understand what a vegan menu item is.  At least they didn't try to offer me a chicken salad.  Guess this review isn't long enough to post so I'll go on.  The restaurant was clean and spacious for the strip. If I go back I'll stick with a salad and balsamic/oil.  Don't think I'll be going back though.  The strip is overpriced and overrated for the most part. I'd gladly eat off strip and get a better deal and the same quality of food. I'd say that this place is good for business lunches and dinners or when you have family in town and they want to see the strip.",

We also ordered gelato (the pistachio flavor to be exact) which was also excellent. We did not try any of the food, so I can't comment on that.  I'm giving four stars though for the prices on their wines at the wine bar area.  SUPER high end and expensive.  For a walk up and 'order yourself type' of place this seemed out of place.  I mean, if I'm gonna buy a $150 bottle I'd want a a bit more ambiance than what is basically a step above fast food place.",

I will say to have such a celebrity's name on it I would have expected better.  We ate lunch there on our first day while we waited for our room at Ceasars to be ready.  My wife and I split the baked pasta and the Caprese sandwich.  The pasta was good but no better than stouffers.  The sandwich needed more of everything.  More tomato, cheese, basil, and balsamic and less bread.  I left pretty disappointedly, but since it was close to the meeting area I returned for breakfast.  Breakfast was really good.  I had the antipasto breakfast sandwich.  It was amazing.  TheItaliann meats and the redpepper sauce went perfectly with the egg.  Something you rarely hear me bitch about is cost.  The breakfast sandwich was fourteen dollars.  It was 1 dollar worth of deli meat and how much does an egg cost.  Coffee was expensive as well. Having said that if you check in on yelp you get three delicious lemon cookies.  They were great.",

The line moves quickly as the ladies behind the counter work like a team of busy bees.  The coffee here is delicious!    The one thing I still think about is the delicious Lemon Panini $14.  It's perfectly prepared with cheese and lemon.  One of the those things that you can't wait to eat again.   Panna Cotta was smooth and delicious.   We loved that it wasn't very sweet.   Italian flag cake.   If you like almonds, you'll love this cake.  Just let it sit out of the fridge (where they keep it) before you eat it.  Great place to eat fast food that isn't fried or unhealthy.   There's something for everyone!  Can't wait to come back.",

If you have a sweet tooth, there are many types of gelato and ice creams to choose from, as well as pastries and those lemon basil cookies that are free with a Yelp check-in and purchase.  Being Italian, Giada seems to fit right into Ceasars Palace and enjoys a wonderful history of food and glamour.",

I was over charged and some of the items are way over priced but I think that's a Caesars Palace price point.  I got : lemon ricotta cookies - tasty and pretty fresh for a bag item. $5 and worth it.  Chocolate chip cookies - very yummy and you can taste the quality ingredients. I was charged $5 even though the bag said $3.  Italian Rainbow cake - very moist, almond flavor and pretty to look at. $6  All in all I hope they sort out their kinks and talk to their employees so when I go back in May I can have some of the hot items and salads.",

Cold and rubbery hash browns, enidible bread, the tiniest pieces of sauage, and luke warm eggs, is not my idea for a nice warm breakfast sandwich. Horrible food quality.  Do yourself a favor, save your money and head over to McDonald's or Einstein Bagels for a better breakfast experience.",

The appearance may be off-putting to some as you can see the pieces of basil... it honestly looks like it was dropped in some grass, however it tastes way better than grass, promise!  The vegetable frittata is a tiny portion for the price, although with this place being located in a casino, that's not surprising. It was also forgettable as there wasn't anything special or unique about the flavour. It's nice if you need something quick for breakfast.  The everything bagel was surprisingly good. It had a strong toasted garlic flavour, which is awesome because I absolutely loooove garlic! The portion of cream cheese is small as you only get a tiny container of Philadelphia cream cheese. It was not enough for the entire bagel... definitely could have used two of those containers!  The free lemon ricotta cookies with yelp check-in are a nice touch. Nothing to blow your socks off but they are pretty tasty! Overall, a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.",

I decided to try one of their sandwiches, a delicious looking hazelnut/Nutella eclair and an iced americano. To tell you the truth, everything was decent, probably slightly above average (hence the 4 stars), but for the price you pay, none of my ordered items were anything impressive. It's a regular sandwich cafe with some desserts and drinks. I walked there from Paris hotel and it wasn't worth it :D I actually don't get the hype about this place.   There is another Giada dinner place at Cromwell hotel (opened recently). I am going to give it a try soon and hoping it will be better :)",

I heard that Giada opened an express type of place so hubby and I were excited to check it out.  They have a great variety of foods to choose from.  Pastries, sandwiches, yogurt, fruit, salads, cakes, smoothies.  OMG, the breakfast sandwiches are delish!  Hubby ordered the Antipasti Breakfast Sandwich which had egg, bacon, prosciutto, mortadella, piquillo pepper mascarpone, and provolone.  It was a pretty big sandwich served warmed on a brioche bun.  He also ordered a side of hashbrowns that were crispy and seasoned with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  I had a bagel w/cream cheese.  It was decent, not as good as NY LOL, but still good. We also shared a strawberry & cream cheese danish.  It was good, really flaky, but the strawberry filling tasted more like jam than fresh strawberries.  Which is still good, just not what I expected.    Don't forget to check in on Yelp.  You get a free package of lemon ricotta cookies that are seriously to die for.",

Vegas has been going through a cold spell lately and this is exactly what I needed to keep me toasty. Top it off, again, ridiculously good.  Besides soup, they have big sandwiches (like really good looking sandwiches), various salads, snacks, coffee, ICE CREAM.... ANNNNNND the size of their sliced cheesecake, oh my goodness. It is not no one bite slice! [Just sayin']  I will be making this AT THE LEAST a once a week stop! Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Visited Pronto on my first trip to Vegas. Since Giada is a favorite celebrity chef of mine I couldn't pass it up. Upon entering I was surprised to see the cannolis prefilled, I hate soft cannoli shells. So I opted for the dark chocolate marscapone cake. My server was happy to assist me, she grabbed my wife's Sin City cookie first while I was still at the register. A supervisor approached and asked me where I seen the cake so I pointed to the menu. Apparently the menu is just for show, and the showcase is available items. So I complete my order of 1 cookie, 1 dark chocolate cream puff, and 1 small chocolate gelato. I unhappily paid the near $20 price to a very confused cashier and took a seat to enjoy our celebrity chef selection. My wife loved her cookie. After her first bite my daughter complained that the chocolate gelato was mint chocolate. My wife's takes a bite and confirms, then I second it with a bite. So I go back to the counter and ask the supervisor if the chocolate gelato should be marked Mint Chocolate. He goes over and looks at the name card and says that it's chocolate and the only mint they carry is a dark chocolate mint which they don't currently have and wishes me a good day. I finished the mint chocolate gelato and gave my daughter the cream puff. I'm very disappointed in the quality of service and taste  of the desserts. So glad that I don't get treated this way back home!",

I ordered Americano coffee (medium 12 oz ), sausage frittata, panini caprese and a small cup of water (free, but for a larger cup you get charged a dollar).  The Coffee needs cream or milk or sugar  to balance the bitterness and the acidity. The sausage frittata was dry and very salty. The panini caprese was dry  and over cooked . The bread was hard , needs tomato ( there was only one thin slice of tomato that covered barely half of the sandwich).  Cheese was ok. It was just a panini with cheese (can't see or taste the basil) & a tiny bit of tomato.  Guiada's reataurant is highly rated and receives raving reviews. For her name to be associated with food that I will rate as below MacDonald's breakfast, is not what I expected. I am assuming that a lot of the breakfast selections are pre made. But I will not settle for food that sacrifices taste even if the price is reasonable. Now, there are other selections- salads, cupcakes, cookies, gelato and sorbet. They look wonderful and appetizing and according to the menu, one can order wine and  other alcoholic beverage.  I will leave that for  others  to review.",

Insanely expensive and not the freshest. Save your coins!",

I ordered the artichoke tuna and it was too salty for my taste. So I ended up eating some of his lobster roll. I also ordered the iced mocha latte and that was fine.

Ultimately, our food was handed to us in five minutes. We were offered a refund but we used players points and told them nevermind.    Very tasty sandwich and salad.",
