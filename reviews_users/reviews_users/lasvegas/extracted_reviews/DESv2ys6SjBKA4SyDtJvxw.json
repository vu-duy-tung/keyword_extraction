I am sure it was because she was working on Christmas day but if you are in a customer driven field, expect to work on holidays and be nice about it.  My Grey Goose and cranberry cocktail was good but my mom's Bombay .Sapphire and topic was not very good.  She said the tonic was flat.  I started with the insalata mimmo - good flavor and I love avocado and mozzarella cheese.  It was very tasty.  For the entrees, I had the veal pic",

He explained the whole menu and answered all our questions.  The service is primo!!  The only thing better than all this was the food.  The bread and oil dip along with wine was a meal in itself, then came the killer salad, barbabietole salad with roasted beets and smoked salmon.  My veal piccata was the best I ever had.  My partner's pasta dish was perfectly cooked and exactly what she expected.  After the meal Michael gave us an opportunity to join the dining club which we were thrilled to do and as a bonus we had 10% taken off the bill.  Why don't we have this restaurant in SoCal?

All of the Italian classics and typical favorites are well represented and very well prepared here. The wine list is truly extensive, and the staff's recommendations at least at my table during my visit was perfect.  It should be noted that the decor of the place (which tries to upscale it's location at the end of a strip mall  and almost pulls it off) could use some attention to detail. One should not have torn artwork hanging on the walls as I found in the side room I was in. And while the wine recommendations were spot on, there were times our table felt ignored...drinks were not tended to, plates were not cleared in a timely manner...in short Ferraro's is a good experience when you're enjoying what's on your plate, but when I'm sitting there with 2 empty glasses for over 15 minutes...at this price point that's not acceptable.   3 Stars. (1 Star docked due to inattentive service).",

    "text": "I love Italian food, and had been craving pasta for several days.  When I checked into my hotel I searched for Italian restaurants close by. Ferraro's immediately popped up.  I noticed that they had happy hour until 7 PM.  Perfect.  I was greeted by both the hostess and server.  I looked over the menu and asked for the wine list.  None of the pasta dishes on Happy hour were served without meat, so I ordered off of the regular menu ($25-$70). The wine I had planned to order was not recommended, so I went with one several dollars more per glass.    The salad and bread arrived quickly, and were very good.  I sat without the pasta dish I had ordered for 40 minutes after the salad was cleared.  I wasn't looking for something super fast, but the wait was excessive. I ordered another glass of wine while waiting. I probably wouldn't have ordered a second had my meal arrived in less time.  When the server passed by half way through the second glass she noticed the pasta hadn't arrived.  She admitted she had forgotten to put in the order. Things happen.  It arrived a few minutes after she noticed.    Having been in the service industry for close to 30 years there would normally be a comped glass of wine or something for the wait.  No.  Full price.  While the service (except for the forgotten order) and food were good, it would seem that they would try to make things right at a family owned restaurant.  I don't have an issue with dropping over $50 or more on dinner. However, this was not what I expected to spend for happy hour. Especially since the restaurant is in a strip mall. Overall I spent an hour and a 45 minutes as a solo diner in the bar waiting for a two course meal.  Even if I had planned on having a regular priced dinner, the entree prices were at least 25% higher than they needed to be, though the food was good. I would most likely take a cab elsewhere next time, or grab a sandwich or slice by the hotel.  Las Vegas has many great restaurants, and I'm here on a regular basis.  Had I felt they were interested in having me as a repeat customer I would gladly try them again.",

    "text": "Ferraro's is getting a solid 3 stars from me.  The restaurant is decked out in nice rustic Italian fashion with dim lighting and white table cloths. My party and I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation slot, but we were seated immediately anyway.  As per the norm of most Italian restaurants, warm bread was brought to the table in a basket covered with a napkin. Brought along with the fresh bread was a ramekin filled with a delicious concoction of what I believed to be olive oil, a bit of roasted garlic, and perhaps a hint of pesto. For appetizers we went with the calamari fritti (fried calamari) which was adorned with a lemon and marinara topped with red pepper flakes. Overall the calamari was mediocre, in my opinion.  For my entree I went for the Bucatini Corti all'Amatriciana. A $24 plate of thick, but hollow bucatini noodles topped with Italian bacon, onions, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I've had variations of this dish in the past but this particular one did not rank up near the top with the others. Don't get me wrong, I knew exactly what I was getting into with my order however for the price I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately, I was not. I am making a general assumption in that the dish prices are predicated upon the restaurant's proximity to the strip, and I am certain the cost of the bacon is something to take note of.  The waitstaff certainly deserved 5 stars. Friendliness, knowledge of the menu, and attentiveness were definitely their strong suits that evening. I did feel bad for the bussers who had to constantly refill the tiny water glasses in front of us, but I suppose I could've just asked for a larger glass.",

First of all, before moving to Vegas, I had never heard of reverse Happy Hours.  Are you kidding me?  HH at 2 am?  Good lord, I LOVE VEGAS!  Also, a bonus is that everything on the late night menu is 50% off!  Whaaaat?!  Their Italian dishes are the real deal.  Authentic, large servings and 100% pure delizioso!  My favorite being their Caprese di Bufala..  The Mozzarella is incredible!  Onto the pastas and Risotto.. Oy Vey!  So good!  Growing up in an Italian household, I know my Risotto.  I'm never fully happy with ordering risotto in a restaurant, but I always make an exception for Ferraro's.  The consistency is perfect, the rice is always al dente and they have a plethora of risotto dishes to choose from. As far as pasta goes, I love to keep it real and stick with Spaghetti but their stuffed ravioli Agnolotti dish would have to be my favorite.  So good!   Lastly, the service is great!   The servers know Italian food and have personally tasted every item on the menu..  About 90% of the servers are from Italy, so the accents are always a plus to the dining experience.  They know it all and you have to respect that.  All in all, great environment, fun crowds, perfect service and delicious food!    Ferraro's is right off the strip, so it's just a short cab ride away..  And, if you're a local trying to show your out-of-town friends a nice late night meal, go here!",

I started with a lovely glass of prosecco. The complimentary house bread is available in white or black olive. My main course was a delicious pollo milanese with arugula salad. The only small hitch was that it was served with a pasta that contained an ingredient to which I am allergic. We had mentioned this to the waiter several times, but it wasn't a serious matter since the pasta was on the side. Actually, we were surprised when we saw the pasta on the plate because it was a lot of food for only $10. My companion quite enjoyed the penne bolognese which was also $10.  The next night we returned with friends, but found the restaurant quite crowded, so we ate at the bar where a full menu is served. The bartender checked twice to make sure that I could have the shrimp and bean appetizer. It might have been the best thing that I ate during our stay in Vegas. Other members of our party split a pizza with beans on it.   The restaurant is on the darker side. When we returned on the second night, there was an attendant in the bathroom which I have always found to be a bafflingly unnecessary amenity. The bar was lively but not overwhelmingly noisy. Good service on both visits. It was a nice break to get off the strip for a change.",

We first discovered Ferraro's, at their old location, when I asked our concierge to recommend a good Italian restaurant off the strip. I'm glad I tipped that guy well as Ferraro's has been our go to place since then. I'm really happy that the food quality and service has not suffered with their move.   We arrived earlier than expected for our dinner reservations but were seated promptly. Service was perfect from water to dessert. Our server took her time explaining the specials, how they were prepared, she checked on us regularly and basically made us feel like we were her only customers, which we were not. We started with the fried calamari which was perfect. For my entree I chose the homemade gnocchi with pesto. My wife opted for the lobster ravioli. You sometimes forget how delicious and lite homemade pasta is... The pasta at Ferraro's is just that.  Ferraro's provided desert as we were celebrating a special occasion, which was very gracious of them. I capped off the dinner with an espresso and Sambuca, nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention their wine book, it's not a list. I'm kinda clueless when it comes to Italian wine but others have told me that their wine list is A++.  Ferraro's is fantastico!",

Two of us had veal and the other two sea bass. Starters were well-presented salads - try the Mimmo - you won't be disappointed. Modest, yet careful selection can get you out the door for about $60 per diner, with tip. Living in the Las Vegas Valley affords us the opportunity to enjoy countless restaurants.

First the waiter went through the menu and pointed out the most expensive items available.  I was fairly turned off that he did that as it was fairly noticeable.  We had some appetizers followed by a salad.  On the last bite of my salad I bit into something sharp / hard, I proceeded to pull it out of my mouth and it was a STAPLE.  I immediately lost my appetite and asked for the waiter.  He came over and seemed fairly pissed off.  He came back and said he spoke to the chef and has no idea how the staple could have gotten in my salad.  He said he would take the salad off the bill and bring us dessert.  I told him we didn't want the dessert and he said he would then comp a glass of wine.  While I didn't complain to get more taken off the bill I did expect more than a salad and a glass of wine ($31 value).  What was most shocking to me is that a manager never came to our table to apologize.  On the way out I saw the manager and told him what happened , his response, \"yes I heard that, not sure how that happened\".  Not the best service and I would be cautious eating here in the future.... watch out for the staple!",

So, on the way back to the Hotel we decided to get some dinner off the strip and not in a Casino. Seeing Ferraro's as we pass a CVS and Tattoo parlor my kid looks at me and say's \"Spaghetti\".          As soon as we walked in to Ferraro's we relied that this was a VERY nice restaurant and that we where very under dressed ( T-shirts and shorts after walking the strip for hours).  None the less a lovely young lady welcomed us, reassured us we would be OK and politely seated us without a reservation.           Our Waiter Eric was nothing less than fantastic! His professionalism, personality and presentation was perfection. His attention to detail in everything from explaining the history of this Family own restaurant to the care and love that go's into everything served was impressive. He helped us navigate and explained the Menu in fine detail and even made me feel good when I could not pronounce the dishes correctly. Never once paying any attention to how we appeared or to our ignorance. Everyone one else in the restaurant was dressed very ,very nice.            The Food. Heaven! They even custom made my daughters favorite Spaghetti and meat balls. I had a Shrimp and spinach pasta dish that I never would have chosen without the help of Eric. Ferraro's homemade paste and fresh ingredients exploded in ever bit.  Being the Day after my kids 17th B-Day, Eric even surprised use with the most Delectable Tiramisu Desert we have ever tasted. And keep in mind I don't have the time to tell you about the Wine. Also decided with the help of Eric.             Thank you Eric and the whole Ferraro's staff/family for such a great experience. I would also like to give a shout out to Angelo, who was on his first day of training to becoming a Master craftsman waiter.",

A lot of times nicer restaurants make you feel bad when bringing in a kid. They did not.   The wine menu is HUGE! It can probably be a bit overwhelming if you are not a wine enthusiast. But the wait staff seemed very knowledgable about their menu.   Overall, we would definitely go back, but only if someone was visiting and staying on the strip. The location is not the best for a local Summerlin family. But we are glad we tried it out!",

    "text": "We went to Ferraros with friends this past Friday, thanksgiving weekend. Our friends stop here every time they are in Vegas so it says a lot about this place.  This place is amazing to say the least! Gianni was our server and he made our experience even better! He had good recommendations for dinner options and when some of us wanted the gnocchi as an appetizer instead of the meal portion he easily made it happen. Gianni knows the menu very well and the way he describes each dish is amazing. You can tell he loves to eat too!   On to the food!  Gnocchi- one of the best gnocchis I have ever had. This is a must order whether you get an appetizer portion or as your dinner entree. It just melts in your mouth. The sauce is a light tomato sauce with basil which was perfectly seasoned. Get it!! (One person at our table got it with the bologna sauce instead. Fabulous in its own way!)  Octopus appetizer- This was one of their special appetizers of the night. It came prepared like a salad with really good olive oil, olives, fried capers and some herbs. Amazing dish, perfectly tender octopus. Simple to bring out the flavors of the dish.   Branzino-yummmm, this Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and seasoned lightly. Underneath was a sweet potato puree and on the sides were mushrooms cooked alongside figs. First time having it that way and it was a delicious combo. This was a very well prepared Branzino!  Seafood tagliatelle-again the seafood was cooked perfectly. You could taste it's freshness in the dish. You see a pattern here at this place, it's all good!   Veal parmigiano- This dish came out prepared slightly different because Gianni said the octopus and following with this dish could crash the palate. So he had it prepared fried then a fresh tomato, arugula and truffle on top. Amazing!! So glad they love their food so much they recommend different ways to get it.  So for dessert, we wanted the crepes and a pistachio cream dessert, but couldn't decide. But guess what, no problem because Gianni will make it happen. He had them make a dessert sampler for us with those two options. Everything came plated separately for each of us like a sampler. You learn quickly that at Ferraros they make it happen. Or should I say Gianni can make it happen. Please ask for him to be your server, he will make your experience even better.  Here's a cool tidbit, Gianni also plays the drums in the band. So he take care of you and in between he plays drums. This place is so cool. We have now also decided we are going to stop here every time we are in Vegas. They really make you feel special here.   Thank you Ferraros and thank you Gianni Montreal!",

My boyfriend liked the food as did I but not enough to come back, my fresh pasta got cold really fast and the sauce was too thick for my taste. Our server was a joke on the other hand, he asked us what we wanted to drink and he never ended up giving it to us.   The busser noticed we had been sitting there for awhile so he took it upon himself to fill our waters. The server came by and noticed and yelled at the busser in the middle of dinner for doing such. Then when the server offered fresh Parmesan cheese for my mans salad, he said coming right up and once again never gave it to us. My man had to flag him down and then he tells us it's the bussers job to give us cheese when he offered and yells at him again. After dinner he brings dessert which was okay, we sat there for about twenty minutes with no sign of our server we ended up walked to the host desk and asked for the check there.  The stars are for the busser who was doing his job and more, it's unfortunate because that place had potential for future date nights but our server couldn't take any responsibility and liked to push blame on coworkers for his short comings. Very unprofessional.",

Food was fair/good: ...salmom-excellent, duck-fairly lackluster (needed a starch added), scallops-good, blue cheese butter salad-good....no kids menu, but offered chicken tenders & half order of spaghetti.   So.....four regular meals & two kid meals with no alcohol close to $300. Based on the dishes we had...I'd say very over priced.",

    "text": "Thank you Eric with a C for a memorabel night in Las Vegas. You definitely made it to our shortlist of places to visit everytime we're in town. European hospitality combined with a passion for food.  Just off Strip, opposite to the Hardrock Hotel we found this place. Of course through Yelp ;). After burgers, pub food and more of that kind during our three weeks of travelling through the USA I craved for real Italian. Not Americanised (don't no if that's a correct word), but real European. And besides the size of the portions (real American) it came very close. And if one thing stood out is was our waiter Eric.  Eric surprised us with his charme, his knowledge and suggestions on the food but most of all with his timing. In all the years in the USA it was the first time we didn't feel rushed and met someone who almost filled in all our needs. Even realizing that we probably needed a cab to get back he arranged one. And detail that probably wasn t influenced by Eric, whe never had such a nice cab driver =).  We we're welcomed with an Yelp appetizer (for checking in) that consisted of Angnolotti and spaghetti. Nice, but so much that we almost regreted ordering an appetizer. Which of course was also big. Glad we shared the charcuterie & cheeses. My love had the rabbit as a main course and I the Angnolotti. Both nice, but with the peperonata and side order of spaghetti way, way to much. Drank lovely wine with it, enjoyed the espresso. All together a beatifull night. And I believe we paid somewhere in the range of $150.  Oh, and don't forget to check-out the bathrooms. And bring some tipping money. They deserve it.  Note: I'm no native speaker so excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes.",

    "text": "I've been going to different restaurants near the Strip for over 20 years now.  I'm not sure that I've been more disappointed than I was here.  It's not that anything in particular stands out as been awful but, rather that nothing at all was good.  We started with happy hour drinks at the bar...not bad, a little pricey but, then there was some kind of mixup with the receipts I was overcharged and then they brought a bill to the table which is pretty disruptive and confusing during my dinner.  Now, I gotta check credit card records to make sure everything is copasetic. Also, there are some tables near the bar area that look much nicer than the tables in the dining room. I requested to be seated at one of them but we were told that it was reserved.  From the start to finish when we left I noticed nobody had been seated at the table we asked for.  As for our table, it seemed small and the chairs uncomfortable.  At one point when the bread came to the table they had to remove the red rose that was placed there in order to accommodate the bread basket :-(  I just thought that was little bit strange too.  The Food: The menu is a little shady & it appears that the pasta is the way to go (Italian place,) but they don't push & prefer the higher ticket items.  Unfortunately, what looked to be the feature pasta ($43,) was the tagliatelle with lobster and scallops.  The seafood in the dish was noticeably fishy (probably a day or two behind what it should have been.)  Did read the famous article that Anthony Bourdain wrote, so We probably should have known better.  I ordered the pomodoro, which looked nothin like pomodoro & more like marinara with a hint of chilli flakes... boo.  When they brought our wine we noticed that it wasn't the same vintage as on the wine list...another miss.  Most of the items including the pasta, salmon,  stuffed pepper and even the desert (with the exception of the cookies,) were pretty underwhelming.  Our server was good though.  For $300 plus there are far better options if you ask me.",

If you want the huge plate of cooked dried pasta that would feed an army vs an authentic homemade Italian dish then this place is not for you... this food is so delicious and authentic!!! Our waiter Tait was amazing !!! I love this place and will for sure be back the next time we are in Vegas!!!",

I didnt think it was possible to get Paris quality food in America, but you can get it here. The wine list is amazing, over 900 different high quality wines available. Cassandra was our bartender and she was so kind, helpful and wonderful! Incredible, service, food quality and atmosphere. This place has it all. You are missing out if you don't eat here! We can't wait to go back!",

Pros: - Perfect for a date, no matter what age - Fancy pants enough to have a bathroom attendant?! - Clean!  Cons: - Erm, like none?   Service - 5/5. Staff was beyond wonderful. Just genuine, warm vibes through and through. People here to treat you with kindness because they're just good people, not ONLY because they're here to make some money. (Which is a great way to earn even more of my money, too.)  Happy Hour Food-  - Wine is 25% off!  - House bread- 5/5 Ohhhhhhh you need this. One of the best I've ever had. - Beet salad- 5/5 Fabulous flavors!  - Calamari- 3/5 pretty generic. Comes with a sweeter sauce. - Caesar salad- 4/5 pretty plating. Whole leaf served - Pizza with prosciutto (forgot the name!)- 5/5 super delicious. - Meatballs with polenta- 4/5  So in summary... I don't have much to say about the HH except that all of the bites were wonderful. Come here with some friends, and look forward to a good night.",

I was visiting from out of town on Memorial Day weekend with my best friend and I'm a huge fan of Italian food but wasn't expecting much since it was almost 2am and I was just flat out hungry. Man oh man was i impressed!! This place was AMAZING I loved everything about it. The service was awesome, the atmosphere was so relaxing and stunning. The furniture, decor, music and lighting was spot on perfection. Then finally we received the food, one word WOW! I couldn't have asked for a better place to go to and I was truly impressed and taken back at how truly amazing this place was. I can't wait to go back! It was truly amazing!",

I was used to seeing this place on Flamingo and Jones for years, and was sad we never made it in before it closed.  But I get this memo with an invite for dinner and was surprised to learn they had just moved locations.  I have to admit, it's smart, now closer to the strip and more business!  Since it was  business dinner, I didn't get the entire menu to choose from but did get to choose from a smaller version.  They started off with an antipasta tray, it had Italian cold cuts, cheeses, marinated vegetables, it was great.    Then they gave use a house salad, mixed greens,with house vinaigrette.  And finally we had our choice of three entrees, 8 oz Prime filet mignon topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms, onions served with starch & vegetable of the day, Grilled organic raised salmon with fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh garlic & Kalamata olives served with starch & vegetable of the day, or Half free-range boneless chicken, extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, served with starch & vegetable of the day.  I chose the filet, it was perfect.  Tender, cooked just right, very good meal.  Our desert was a creamy cheesecake topped with fresh raspberries in a raspberry coulis.  It was a perfect meal, cooked perfectly, service was excellent and it was free, oh, I did have to listen to the presentation but it was worth it!",

We had such a fantastic experience several years ago when we were in Vegas that I asked to return to Ferraro's on this trip.  Since our last visit they've moved (better location, nicer interiors).  The setting is lovely, the food is fantastic.  Our server, John, was disappointing.  He was inattentive, did not listen, and seemed uninterested right up until he announced that he gave us the \"local discount\" (good for us).  However, conditions of the local discount added an automatic 18% gratuity.  Clever.   The busser was very attentive and would have made a far better waiter than our waiter.",

    "text": "I left Ferraro's disappointed. Good service could not make up for lackluster, overpriced food.   I had the Caesar Salad and the Risotto Aragosta e Tartufo Nero (Italian vialone nano rice, lobster meat, seasonal black truffles, mascarpone, truffle oil).   The Caesar salad was good. Two hearts of romaine topped with a decent Caesar dressing and shaved Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.   The Risotto was a total disappointment. If there was any lobster meat in it, I couldn't tell. I could neither see any or taste it. To make matters worse, I could not pick out any truffle taste in the Risotto.  So, essentially I had what amounted to a $38.00 bowl of rice. Even though someone else paid for my dinner, I felt cheated!  On a brighter note, the three people in our party that had the Seafood Pasta absolutely raved about their dishes. The four others in the party neither complained  nor expressed anything positive about their meals.   Finally, Ferraro's does not allow any outside wine. So, if you have a special bottle for a special occasion, plan on going somewhere else!  The best way to sum up Ferraro's is: Michelin-rated prices with Yelp 3 star food.",

(It's the little things) That's why I am both pleased and proud to give Ferrarro's a 5-Star review. You sure as hell wouldn't expect it when seeing their location, a strip center on the corner of Harmon and Paradise. But once you walk insie, you immediately forget you are in a strip mall. Someone clearly put some time, effort, and money into the place, right down to the beautiful Italian Murano-glass lighting fixtures. Long story short, everything about the menu is the real deal. Killer wine selection, classic menu, and almost overly attentive waitstaff. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that the fare is a bit pricey. Worth every penny though. I recommend the Pappardelle Mimmo, and the Caprese.",

Wine went down well too which was recommended by the server. He was quite candid about to go for and what may not be as suitable which was much appreciated. Ambiance was perfect for being able to talk in peace with just the right amount of background noise. Sometimes the dead silence can be as bad as a Metallica cover band.  Also was not tacky, as many of the semi off strip outlets can be. It is a bit pricy, albeit worth it, but would refrain me from making it a usual haunt. However, I'll be back.",

    "text": "I reserved to have my girlfriends birthday dinner here on April 25th , 2015 . it was her 30th bday so I wanted something special for her and to have  a good time , good food and good memories . Well we got 1 of the 3 . The food was very good and depending on what you got the portions were perfect . However our server ( tony)  ended our night on a bad note and we will definitely never be going here again.   At first when we arrived we loved the look of the place and the welcoming atmosphere from our waiter and servers. We had a large party ( 16 ppl) and spent  $700  in this restaurant. As we finished dinner Tony brought the check out as 1 bill, as a courtesy  to him I said that was fine and we would just try and see who had what and let him know what to charge on which card. Well the amounts on the check were not adding up to what people purchased and it was becoming very difficult to distinguish , after about 30 minutes myself and a friend  asked Tony if he could please just separate the check so we could see why the amounts weren't adding up and also to make it easier on us to be able to pay separate checks for each party , I explained to him that it had already been 30 minutes after we had finished dinner and we just wanted to be able to pay and leave and continue our night , as we had plans and places to be . He just straight out told me no he could not and would not do that because it was not possible . I asked him then \" Can you ask a manager to see if they can help us out , since the customer is priority and this trying to figure out the bill is becoming a huge inconvenience  for myself and my party \", he then responds with  \" No I cannot because then I must run 7 different cards and do separate transactions and that would be you inconveniencing me as a server and take up time and before I could get another word out he simply walked away from myself and my friend. I was completely taken back that he would even speak to me in that way , me being a customer who just had a party who spent a good amount of money  in the restaurant. We did find a manager on duty and explained to her what just happened and she apologized on his behalf but said that there was nothing she could do as the max cards they could run were 6 cards . We had 7 and they would not even make an exception and find a way to help us.   What really irritated me was that he had made that comment that it would inconvenience him and take up time  and the attitude he had that went with it  and he did not even try to get a manager to help or assist .   Funny thing is...I didn't just look up the restaurant  on Google or yelp, a local in Vegas ( a  good friend ) recommended it and when I told him about my experience he was so embarrassed.  Also when Tony took our cards to pay the bill, it took him 15 -20 minutes to come back . Therefore , it still took him a while to run the cards we did give him, so why not just separate the checks like I had asked and let us pay that way , as it would've taken the same amount of time to just accommodate my party.   Luckily this did  not ruin the whole night , but I believe it was  an unacceptable and embarrassing situation for this restaurant owner, The  staff should be better trained than to argue and be rude with customers. we would have  loved to try the wine bar or happy hour next time , since we are in Vegas a few times a year.. but we will not be going back here again.

The most popular dish is the osso bucco and they are known for it! BEST IN TOWN! I also had the boars meat pappadelle and it was magnificent!   They also have a great lounge menu if you're looking for a more casual experience! This place isn't too pricey, but it's definitely more upscale which I like. GREAT wine list too, just know they don't allow you to bring your own wine for a corkage fee.   The service is always great, and definitely a more slower dining expericence to really enjoy yourself, your company, and the food. This would also be a great place for a business dinner since you can actually hear the person next to you :)   I'm sure i will be coming back for many more years to come.",

So let's just say I love bellinis, and that was yummy!  There were various passed appetizers but my absolutely favorite were the arancini (risotto balls) with truffle essence!!! MMMM I knew right away there were truffles in them!  I had 3, but as everyone around me said they could not have a fried item out of guilt, I started to slow it down :)    So four stars for bellinis, truffled arancini, hosting a charity event, and not kicking us out of our special area by the bar long after the event.  Usually places do that, and the happy hour was 7-9, but I left close to 11.  I am not the biggest fan of Italian food in general, but I would probably go back for more arancini and maybe to try something else.  The location is convenient!",

    "text": "My Partner was so excited to take me to this place for our engagement anniversary and I have never been more disappointed and aggravated with a service before in anywhere in the world as I was with this place.   Service started ok with our server but it went down hill completely after our dinner was served, we were completely ignored by every single server and busboy in the section we were seated. We were not asked once if we needed anymore drinks, neither we were offered the dessert menu. The restaurant was not busy at that point and I noticed severs either just standing around or attending a conversation to the table next to us, who obviously was someone they new or a regular customer.   When my partner finally got the attention of our waiter and expressed our aggravation, neither we received an apology or to do anything to aliviate the situation; all he said it was that the place was busy when it was not. When we ask for the bill the waiter brought back and tossed at the table and didn't even say thank you or good night.   I called the restaurant and spoke with the office manager to expressed my frustration. She was very attentive and assured me that she would ask the general manager or the owner to call me back to listen to my frustration and try redeem their service and somehow to aliviate the situation, but no one ever called back.   I have never been treated in such poorly manner or been ignored anywhere before and clearly this place do not care about new clientele or their reputation.   Bottom line If you are a same sex couple I do not recommend to visit this place, clearly we are not welcome or appreciated in this establishment.",

We got there a little early and decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited, $22 for a glass of Chardonnay, the only one they offered by the glass!  With an extra hour and a half wait to get a table with a view, we yelped and found Ferraro's.  So glad we did.  Very classy, old school style Italian restaurant.  Best chicken piccata we've ever had.  Hubby and I split a salad, small plate and entree and were happy as clams!  Definitely would  Update...went back to Ferraro's and brought friends.  So glad we went back.  Francesco our waiter was amazing!  Sincerely the best service you could imagine. Had the stuffed pepper appetizer special, shared the Caesar salad and had the piccata again.  Everything was simply delicious.  Friends loved their special appetizer tasting, Osso Buco, and pasta with crab.  The atmosphere was lovely, but once again the service sealed the deal.  Will definitely come here whenever we are in town!",

First impression, it's a very nice restaurant. We were seated right away, and service was great throughout our meal. We decided to split an appetizer and a meal since we didn't want to get too full, we've split meals at other Italian restaurants in Las Vegas (Maggiano's) and left totally stuffed. We ordered the artichoke appetizer and the Veal Piccata. Both were absolutely delicious, however very small portions and a hefty price. If you want more bang for your buck I would recommend Maggiano's, but if you're by Ferraro's and are looking for more of a fine dining (small portion, larger bill) place, Ferraro's is great.",

I called and after a frustrating experience booking with Bootlegger was super pleasantly surprised by how seamless the process was!  The food was also excellent.  Everyone raved about the bread and the lunch specials are fantastic value.  Their pasta is made in house and I ate ever last bite of my dish.   We were seated in a private area which was really nice and the waiter was overall attentive.  The only reason they don't get a full 5 stars is that they are a bit pushy.  They kept trying to get us to order extra appetizers or drinks or coffee or dessert and you really got the sense that they were disappointed that we didn't.  I'm happy to order extra when I have the room for it but none of us were that terribly full because we had a late breakfast.  I wish they didn't make us feel bad to just order exactly what we felt like.  But overall a good experience and I would return!  (Maybe just hungrier, ha!!)",

It was pure perfection we ordered a Caesar salad and we loved it. We started out with a fried artichoke heart with cheese and a few other little things sprinkled in.

I originally had reservations for an Italian restaurant at the Blasio hotel and casino but after quite a few reviews on yelp I noticed that their customer service was not so good so I decided to continue my research and found this amazing Gem!!!  My wife I were celebrating our 26 th anniversary and I wanted to take her somewhere with great food atmosphere and service and boy did we find it. Upon our arrival we were greeted with a very friendly and warm host quickly set us at our table. Our waiter was very friendly very patient with us because if you look at their menu it's not the easiest thing to read it's authentic Italian food. My wife and I were on decisive on what to order again because we share almost everything. Our waiter noticed we were struggling with the menu and made some suggestions we went ahead and ordered based on his suggestions.   My wife ordered some chicken dish which was out of this world I've never had anything like that and I ordered some spaghetti with garlic and chili's again out of this world so so good.   It was relaxed the service was great the food you can tell is home made with love. For dessert we ordered a tiramisu and a coffee. Overall, this place is Amazing!!!!!   As much as I dislike Vegas now, I would fly there just to eat at this fine establishment!!!!   Out of all the places we made reservations to eat while in Vegas, this was the only one that gave us the WOW FACTOR!!!!! So, thank you!!!!!",

Now I have to stop saying that Las Vegas is lacking in good Italian food.  I don't know if I should start with food or service because both were beyond excellent. We had a reservation and we were promptly seated upon arrival. Our waiter greeted us quickly and he gave a nice overview of the menu options. He informed us that the restaurant actually makes all of their pasta.  We started with the pesto gnocchi and risotto caprese. I've never been so impressed with pasta. The gnocchi was so delicate and the pesto so creamy and flavorful. I didn't think I liked risotto, but now I realize I'd just never had it prepared well. The next course was salad. I had the Ferraro salad which had an Earthy flavor. My husband loved his caesar salad. For the entrees, I had the ossobucco and my husband had the chicken parmesan. The ossobuco was so tender and flavorful. I loved the sauce that surrounded it as well. As good as my occobuco was, I think my husband's chicken parmesan was even better. Lastly, we had a sampler of a cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was really good with a slightly sweet taste and the shell was something I could eat alone it was so good. The tiramisu was have a moment good. Yum!  The service is deserving of its own note. It's obvious that the restaurant has made great service a priority and dedicated time to training to achieve this. The staff is very attentive. Our water glasses never went below half a glass, with each course a gentlemen with parmesan and black pepper appeared and the way plates were placed in front of us was very deliberate and polite. They didn't skip a beat and the service definitely made us feel well taken care of while dining here. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I'm a Vegas local that enjoys trying all the wonderful restaurants Vegas has to offer. This is my honest review after eating here for the first time.  The entrees just weren't that good. My date and I ordered different veal dishes. The plating on my meal looked sad. The potatoes looked like a small leftovers portion. The veal was edible but the sauce was very overpowering. My date's veal was cooked excellently but the sauce and everything else on the plate was just bland. Not at all what we were expecting for a restaurant with such great reviews and higher prices. We expected multiple flavors in our dish but everything just took on the flavor of the sauce it was served with, and the sauces were bland. Our prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer was good. So was the table bread and pesto. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and the waiter was friendly. Maybe we just went on a bad night because it was Valentine's Day and we didn't order from the preset Valentine's menu? Either way, we left disappointed in the quality of our entrees after spending over $150 on our dinner. We decided to get dessert at another restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are far better restaurants in Vegas that have entrees worth spending that much money.",

I ordered Agnolotti which was cooked in a delicious tomato sauce that i can't describe until you try . The pizza and the crispness of the dough were amazing . The only reason I wouldn't give 5 because I was not too impressed with their appetizer that we tried  ( octopus and mozzarella cheese ) . I give excellent for the service provided by Apollo . Very impressive knowledge of the menu and the description of the plates .",

    "text": "Came in for HH with friends when other plans fell through: called the Ora Sociale, from 4-7pm daily, there is a food menu and 25% off drinks in the bar and lounge area. I've heard great things about this place, and their HH in general, and was surprised to see that they weren't busy.  DRINKS: The Chianti by the glass ($13) is tasty, as was the Ciao Bella ($14) cocktail that I sampled from a friend. The drink discount is helpful, because HH food prices are only valid with a drink purchase. ARANCINI ($6): Portion of four rice balls served with a truffle-tinged dipping sauce. These were a solid carb-o-licious option.  POLPETTINI ($5): Portion of two meatballs, really tasty. Save the red sauce for dipping for your bread basket, it's good. CALAMARI FRITTI ($8): Nicely crisp, mix of rings and baby squid, tasty marinara dipping sauce. Hard to go wrong iwth this dish. CAPRESE SALAD ($5): Tiny and somewhat boring portion, two pieces of buffalo mozzarella and a wedge each of red and yellow tomatoes. Maybe their classic Ferraro salad is a better option. SALSICCIA PIZZA ($10): San Marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage with rapini and Calabrian oil. The sausage is not spicy, don't let that turn you off. Pizza is a decent size for sharing, crust is thin and crispy. Overpriced though IMO. AGNOLOTTI ($7): Got this after seeing it recommended in a recent article, portion is two large ravioli stuffed with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, and mortadella with a light tear-drop tomato sauce. Not sure I'd get it again necessarily but it was good to try and the pasta itself was fresh. CREPES ($12): From the dessert menu. Two rich Nutella crepes served with vanilla ice cream. I'm not  a dessert person, so this wasn't my pick but it was good. I'd see if they have a lighter fruit-based option instead.  Service was attentive, especially when it came to drink refills. Food came out fast, most prices were fairly reasonable (exceptions being the salad and pizza). They weren't busy for HH but definitely picked up around 6:30 as the dinner crowd started coming in. Note that there are several small dining rooms/nooks for a special occasion or family dinner. There's also a bathroom attendant, which I found odd. Undecided on whether I'd come back for dinner.",

We came in dressed very casually, but were welcomed immediately with a kind word and a smile. The good-The pinot grigio we had was delicious. The olive oil/pesto dipping sauce was divine. The lasagna was well done,the pasta tasted very fresh, and the size was hearty. The tiramisu was amazing. It was the best thing I ate. The not so good-The prices were really high. I was not expecting to pay 26 dollars for lasagna and 12 dollars for a dessert. Yikes! The bread was 50/50. It was a mix of a dinner roll and what seemed to be fococcia. The roll was good, but the fococcia was so dry, that the oil mixture didn't even soften it. Our service was slow once we were seated, I think they may have forgotten about us, but they were busy, so I'm willing to let that go.  Overall a nice place for a romantic date, but nothing some place I would go regularly.",

Came as a birthday celebration for my friend and it was a great choice (on her part). There's a nice lounge and bar area that we attempted to sit until the band started playing. It's is uncomfortably loud inside when the saxophone and trumpet are playing alongside the cello and piano. We opted to move to the patio. There are musters outside, but at 11pm we weren't in need of them. We could still hear the music outside but also our own thoughts and each other. A perfect solution to my hearing problem.   The late night menu is 25% off and you get a free glass of wine with the purchase of an entree when checking in with Yelp!   Fritto Misto- calamari. Delicious and great serving  Arancini- rice balls! This was the nights winner. Comes fried with a white Alfredo truffle sauce!  Pappardella Mimmo- a seafood pasta with a great amount of lobster and large scallops!!!!!  I can't wait to come back!!!!",

We got a free calamari appetizer by checking in on Yelp. My friend and I wanted to split a dish and I was craving pasta in red sauce so we asked for the server's recommendation and went with it. It was the Bucatini Corti All'Amatriciana which was this delicious pasta with bits of Italian bacon in it.  Since the server knew we were splitting our dishes, our plates came out pre-portioned which is always nice. He grated fresh parmesan on top and the dish was filling and very flavorful.   There was a small mix up with our bill at the end and we ended up paying the check for the table next to us. Our server apologized and quickly fixed this as soon as he realized it. He was super nice and everything else was so fantastic that this didn't impact my overall experience.  A little on the pricier side but well worth it for the service and taste!",

The room was lovely and welcoming. The food was some of the best I've ever eaten. There was 15 of us, and everything was hot, ready and mouthwatering delicious. The calamari and meatballs, everyone had some and wanted more! Crisp green Caesar salads followed. We picked out a menu with four selections(Pasta, Chicken, Steak and Salmon) I picked the Filetto di Manzo, I've been to many 5 star steak restaurants in Las Vegas. I've never had anything so tender, and melt in your mouth wonderful as Ferraro's Filetto di Manzo. Everything came together like a perfect harmony to my taste buds. I cannot wait to go back and have it again! Thank you so much everyone at Ferraro's for making it a wonderful memory for my family and friends on such a happy day!

Since we were meeting some local friends who had not yet eaten at Ferraro's either we all went for happy hour.  What a treat! The restaurant is in a strip mall so we were not expecting how nice it was inside. We started with meeting Gino the owner -- fun and friendly. Then his staff. We were laughing and having a good time even before ordering wine (very extensive list) and appetizers. We started with the meatballs, arancini, salad, and rigatoni Bolognese. We could not believe how wonderful every item was. We scarfed everything down and ordered more plus a pizza appetizer. I guess we should have just had dinner but this sure was fun. My husband and I go to Italy every year and this is the best Italian food we've had in the USA. We can't wait to have a reason to return to Las Vegas -- well, maybe Ferraro's will be the reason!",

Steered here by a taxi driver, my friend and I could not have lucked out any better.  To start, the team was gracious and professional, helping me by holding my bags (seems like this happens a lot in town, especially because it is 5 minutes from McCarron.)  With no reservations we were prepared to sit at the bar, but were lucky to get a great table on the well designed patio.  Tony, our server and friend of the family, was great as well.  He guided us to an unbelievable Barbera, and then helped with a 5-course meal of:  - Nonna's Stuffed pepper, a special that night, but something that reminded both of us of our own grandmothers' cooking.  Solid and a nice portion to share for two.  - Caesar - split - served as a Romaine Wedge, with dressing perfectly and attractively applied by squeeze bottle, a huge, think peel of the Parmigiano Reggiano and a dusting of crisp bread crumbs rather than croutons.  Also a masterful and creative take on a traditional Caesar.  - Now it gets interesting:  the Spaghetti Scoglio was OUTSTANDING.  With shrimp, clams, scallops and calamari, this take on a friutti de mare was balanced nicely with just enough of Chef Mimmo's homemade spaghetti, so it was a dish of seafood, rather than a dish of pasta with some seafood.  Truly one of the best fruitti's I have ever had.  The red sauce balanced with just enough roasted garlic, cheese, and what felt and tasted like a tiny hit of cream at the end for added richness.  - Finally, we shared the Veal Chop Milanese, which was not only huge and beautifully prepared, but the arugula, cherry tomato and ricotta salata salad balanced everything perfectly.  - Dessert was likewise a standout, sharing the Pistachio Passion, a layering of mascarpone, pistachio pudding and whipped cream.  Just light enough but very well executed.  As literally my very first review, I hope this helps folks find this amazing restaurant in Sin City!",

    "text": "Upscale Italian with live music (think Sinatra and soft pop) in the bar! The decor is really modern, but still warm and inviting. Clean lines with archways and wood and glass. Everything was spotlessly clean. We were in Las Vegas for a softball tournament and wanted to have a quiet date night not on the strip. The drinks were perfectly made at the bar, where we ate from the happy hour 'small plates' menu. We had the gnocci, the meat lovers pizza and the spinach ricotta ravioli. The pizza was a 6 slice 9 inch personal pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mearballs - the crust was thin enough to be crispy and thick enough to be pizza crust and not a cracker. The ravioli were delicious, but there were only 2 - the light sauce and thin pasta were excellent, and I could have eaten 10 or 20 of them. The gnocci were light and airy with a gutsy sauce. All of the sauces were delicious, and all were different savory delights. All of the food was served hot. We both were delighted to share the pistachio creme dessert. It was light and creamy and served cold (one of my pet peeves is when you order a cold dessert and it is lukewarm or frozen when it's served) - not too sweet, and really delicious. The service was excellent, and the piano player/singer  music a real treat. Definitely try this gem for a night out that is classy.",

    "text": "Best Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas, hands down! This place is just amazing. Their food is so delicious, everyone is very friendly, and they have a wine list second to none. If you come when it's not 100F in Vegas, I highly recommend getting a table in the patio, especially if you're on a date ;) Your date will be impressed.  This is a family owned place, real Italians. Chef Mimmo is a great cook, and he always comes out to the dining room to check on everyone. His brother Walter is the best PR in town, he practically knows everyone and he's always happy to make your Vegas stay more enjoyable and memorable. Joaquin is our favorite server, he knows the menu top to bottom and he always has a couple recommendations off the menu that will knock your socks off.   As far as the food goes, I don't know where to start... My all time favorite is the ribeye, which is actually not on the menu, and is not always available... That piece of meat is better than any steak you will have at any of the top steakhouses, word. The pappardelle Mimmo are also to die for if you are a seafood lover.   My fiance and I go to Vegas 3-4 times a year and we always have at least one meal at Ferraro's. We feel right at home and we eat like royalty. Thank you Ferraro family!!",

It was tender, to be sure, but the dish itself wasn't anything special, nor was the beef carpaccio appetizer we had.  The service was also severely lacking.  Our server didn't come by the table any more often than it took to take our  drink and food orders.  He never offered drink refillls, and just seemed generally disinterested in providing a good dining experience at all.  It's not crazy expensive, but they're trying to be upscale, and it doesn't quite work.  Give it a pass.",

We dropped into Ferraro's (a little under dressed) but they were able to seat us right away.  We were seated in the bar area, where they have high top tables cozied up around the bar.    If you are looking for an extensive wine list, almost an encyclopedia of wine, this is your place.  They appear to have it all!  The food was fresh, but was very heavy.  We probably should have shared a salad and an entree between the two of us.  We finished the meal with a raspberry cheesecake that was divine.  The atmosphere was very busy.  There were a lot of staff and patrons coming and going around our table.  There was a lounge singer warbling out Christmas tunes, backed up by a piano player, but due to the volume of the chatter in the bar you could hardly hear them.  I gave Ferraro's 3 stars because our service , the atmosphere, and food were only so-so compared to the prices you pay.  We went in well over $100 for our meal and it was something I could have gotten at a chain Italian restaurant.    Next time, I would come back here for desserts and drinks, but not for a full meal.",

Having grown up in an Italian family, this is the only restaurant in Las Vegas that serves the kind of homemade dishes that my parents and grandparents made for dinner, especially on Sundays. The pasta is homemade and all the sauces are made from scratch. The vibe you get from the entire staff makes it obvious that Ferraro's is a family run business from the minute you walk through the door to the end of dinner. It is not like in the casinos where everything is so corporate and robotic. My opinion comes from 25 years working in the restaurant business (most of which I spent in the kitchen) and from my 100% Italian ancestry.",

We split an antipasto and the carbonara, then we had the osso bucco.  It was really quite memorable.  To top it all off, they had live music and the service was great.

My boyfriend had asked me where I wanted to go and I had told him to surprise me. Well, he sure did and he did a great job by picking Ferraro's. We had reservations but arrived about 30 minutes early. Regardless, they seated us right away. Within a couple of minutes, our amazing waiter grabbed us some drinks, bread + olive oil and left menus for us to review.   We ordered the cheese platter (Formaggi) as an appetizer & pasta (Fettuccine Pomodor con Ricotta Fresca) for dinner. The pasta itself was more than enough and the ingredients were fresh.   I think what topped it all off for me was the fact that they seated us in an area that was away from the more \"casual\" dining. We didn't have to ask, they just did this. Our waiter created a short lived relationship and shared some stories about his hometown in Italy.   I might add that the Wine Bar has such a large selection. I've seen some reviews on here that complain about how much wine they get but, really? If you're looking to get shit faced off wine with a full \"glass\" of it (lol), you probably don't belong here.   I can't wait to return for round 2!",

Me, our son and husband called ahead several weeks from out of town for my husband's SPECIAL birthday dinner. Then we called to confirm when we got in town. When we got to the restaurant they said they said they didn't have our reservation!! Whatever, let's eat. They finally sat us. We ordered a 250.00 bottle of wine. The risotto Nero is nothing but rubbery old lobster Zatarain's rice from a box!! YUCK!!! My husband got the osso buco. It was bland in a generic sauce with no vege's or tecture. Slimmy meat. Our son's pasta was also bland and very undercooked and I know what al dente means. When I sent back my HORRIBLE RISOTTO NERO that acted rather pissy to me and the waiter just walked AWAY without even asking me if I would like something else. I guess in a very vain attempt to try salvage a tip they sent out 3 little sloppy desserts with very melted sloppy ice cream never even asking us what we might have wanted for dessert! But the creme de la creme insult (excuse the pun) was they actually had the nerve to put a 3/4 burned USED CANDLE on my husband's dessert!! How RUDE. I think when you spend 250.00 on a bottle of wine you should be treated with some respect and hospitality not like the people whom you are trying to insult. I think Michael would have treated Fredo better than this in the Godfather!!  I have learned NEVER order the wine until you taste the food!!",

A short walk across the street allows options galore!  Based on Yelp reviews, my SO and I went out for our first Italian restaurant dinner that wasn't wood-fired pizza in YEARS.  Sure, I order italian style food at French restaurants, but a honest-to-goodness Italian resto hasn't been of interest. I can make pasta at home any day.  The service was 10 star worthy, making sure every detail was perfect, despite our \"wine by the glass\" type of night vs the huge table of big-tipping Italian men.  For starters, I got a half portion of gnocci in gargonzola sauce and the toothiness was perfect. There is not a doubt that it was made within the day.   The specials of the evening were a whole fish, deboned table-side or a poached fish. So as not to offend the non-fish eater, I got the poached whitefish.  My French is good enough to know that Beurre Blanc sauce and what the fish was poached in means butter!  Between that and the amazing bread basket with butter I probably ate a whole stick.  But, what is eaten in Vegas, stays in Vegas, non?",

It wasn't too much of a risk since the avg. review was 4 stars.  The restaurant is right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.  Parking is in the strip mall.  So we didn't have to spend extra on the valet.  Always a plus in my book.   The restaurant was modern with a classy flare.  Service was fantastic and our server was very helpful in aiding us on our wine selection.  He was very knowledgeable.  They have an extensive wine selection by the glass, half bottle or even sample tastings 1oz, 3oz and 5oz.   We decided to start with the fritto misto (calamari, zucchini & fennel).  The batter was light and well seasoned.  Not greasy at all.  The marinara sauce that accompanied it was a great compliment.   I got the 18oz. rib eye medium and the gf got the risotto with truffle and lobster in a cream sauce.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  It had a nice crust and the balsamic glaze made it easier to eat the steak to the finish.  It had a nice burnt crust just like what you get from the grill.  The risotto was al dente and the truffle added a great aroma to the dish.  The recommended wine pairing cut through the creaminess and made it easier to consume.   I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's better than most of the restaurants on the strip and the service is not stuffy.",

We started with the Calamari, which was fine if you enjoy eating or rather chewing on Lego tires and the pan sauted shrimp was overcooked and rubbery. My brother had the \"Signature\" Osso Buco and had to spit it in his napkin because it tasted so bad.  As for the rest of our meals .. well they were not much better As a matter of fact we ended up going to Subway afterwards because no one really wanted to make a scene in the restaurant but it became a joke while we were in the car.... not that my dad appreciated that much, since he had paid a pretty penny to feed the eight of us.  Anyway, the wait staff sucked. Never got any drinks other than water although we asked several times and they were always \"coming\". and to top it off it then took about 45min to just get our check.",

I've been a regular since I moved to Vegas three years ago and my girlfriend even gets frustrated because it's the only place I ever want to eat.  For a great lunch join Nina at the bar.  The \"love your lunch\" specials include soup or salad and a delicious entree!  Free for happy hour?   The small plates happy hour menu is the best deal in town.  Ask for Anna, she's the sweetest waitress in the lounge.   If you are a Vegas local, Ferraros has AMAZING local deals every night....just ask your server.  If you sit in the dining room you need to ask for Kimberly. Not only is she knowledgeable about the menu, but so funny and makes for a most enjoyable evening. My favorite dishes include  all the homemade pastas, the osso buco,  carpaccio,  the dover sole.....and I always save room for the pistachio passion!  For a romantic date night,  dinner with the parents,  or boys night out.....Ferraros is the best restaurant in Las Vegas!",

Gorgeous restaurant with nice outdoor dining area and fire pit- some nights they have live music. Killer 1/2 off deal for locals fri/sat nights. My favorite is the Spaghettini Scoglio which has tons of shrimp, scallops, clams, calamari & lobster in a light tangy tomato sauce and the insalta Mimmo which has heirloom tomatoes, avocado, red onion & fresh mozzarella-- but, everything i've had on the menu (especially the steaks) are AMAZING.",

We were seated immediately by our waiter Guiseppe on the patio and had wine and appetizers (house-made sausages and very delicate calamari) while the staff catered to our every need.  Once we finished we move into one of the beautiful dinning rooms and began the main part of our meal.  I had the Colorado Rack of Lamb, which was exquisitely prepared although I can also say they have one of the best Osso Bucos you will ever expirence!  This was followed by a delicious dessert of baby cannoli and tiramisu that was out of this world.  I also wish to give the sommelier credit for picking out a great bottle of wine for our table.  This is a must try while in Las Vegas!",

My dispute with Ferraro's restaurant in Las Vegas was on a charge of $400 for cancelling a reservation less than 48 hours before the time we were to be there. After lodging 3 disputes with my credit card company and finally having to have American Express' Advocacy Department call Ferraro's twice they issued an initial credit for $25 and later a credit for $125 (after the second call) for a total of $150. I have to give kudos to American Express for pursuing the issue, but mostly for making up the difference and crediting my account for the additional $250. That is why I have used American Express as my main card for over 30 years.",

We really enjoyed the ambiance of the West Flamingo location and lamented its relocation. We've been to the new Paradise Road location twice and are still trying to warm up to it. Two things that have never changed, and in some ways have gotten better and better, are the food and owner Gino's hospitality. There are new menu items, a wider range of appetizers and side dishes and more nightly specials. My wife absolutely loves the melt in your mouth gnocchi, but last time it came with a gorgonzola cream sauce. She's not a big fan of gorgonzola so ordered something else, but this time it had a saffron cream sauce that was beautiful. I had the pappardelle mimmo, which was heavenly. Fork tender scallops, lobster, asparagus with butter, sage and truffle. If it wasn't a nice restaurant I'd lick the plate. We started with the mozzarella with parma prosciutto over arugula salad. The salad was a bit overdressed but otherwise was absolutely delicious. We ended the meal with a cannoli, a perfect topper to the meal. With three glasses of wine our bill came to $150, including tax and tip.",

Went here on the recommendation of the Concierge in the hotel, and got a GLOWING seal of approval by the bit boss Maria who is 100% Italian and said if she and her husband go for Italian they go here or she cooks it at home!  We met some very nice folks at the bar while waiting a very short time for our table.  They spend a quite a bit of time in Vegas and are regulars.  We had one of the BEST waiters we have ever experienced, Gianni!  It was like eating dinner with family and friends.  We had a meatball/sausage appetizer - awesome!  My husband had the Osso Bucco and if he could have licked the plate he would have.  I had chicken piccata and it was outstanding.  The sommelier (sorry can't remember his name) helped us pick out a great bottle of Borolo that rounded out our meal very well.  I had to use the restroom during dinner and this very nice man escorted me through the restaurant and it turned out to be Gino the owner.   We also had the opportunity to meet another waiter Joaquin who was also extremely helpful and gave us some great tips for things to do.  Definitely a team approach to making sure the customers are served with expertise!!  We topped off the night with a dessert sampler that was again, awesome!  As Boston folks we we accustomed to excellent Italian desserts, the canoli and tirami su were excellent!  We won't take a trip to Vegas without going back!  I also took a look around the restaurant - and they have many private rooms for groups as well.",

Gino offered us a tour of his kitchen (cleanest kitchen I have ever been in) and wine cellar. During the tour, we got to observe some of his pasta being hand made (daily activity).   Dinner then started. Our server was Mr. Ferraro's nephew. We were told at the table to not bother with reading the menu, as Mr. Ferraro was preparing everything for us (food and wine selection). After being carefully quizzed about any possible allergies and how we like meat typically prepared, the meal started!   We enjoyed (4) courses and (2) bottles of wine. The food was absolutely amazing and the wine paired perfectly. As good as the food was, the service exceeded. Each dish was explained to us in detail and there was much follow up asking how we liked the evening.   I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area. It is convenient and easy to get to, and the overall experience is something we will not soon forget.",

    "text": "I came here on my company's dime for a dinner with the execs and sales people during a weekend at a tradeshow.  When I heard Ferraro's was off the Strip, I rejoiced because it was nice getting out of that scene; at the same time, I thought wtf are we going???  When we pulled into the strip mall and spied the \"massage parlor\" again I thought wtf are we going?  However as soon as we walked in my concerns were put to rest.  The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, darkly lit with a small trio playing music.  Not too small and not too large, like Goldilocks said just right.  The staff at Ferraro's was great, being that we were a party of 25 at 8PM on a Friday which is a nightmare for a restaurant you're not expecting much but everyone was quite gracious. The servers took their time to tailor their suggestions for what everyone was looking for, whether it was more information about a particular wine or suggestions for appetizers.    Food and wine were delicious, well from what I saw and heard from my fellow diners.  I didn't taste what was on everyone else's plates (cuz um yea I'm not going to ask the CEO if I can try his osso bucco), but my food was delicious.  I took a different direction from my co-workers and went with the ribeye, cooked medium with rapini.  When my plate came to the table everyone else got a lil bug eyed because it really was quite large.  My hunger got the best of me though and after being up for 12 hours at the tradeshow I inhaled my steak which was perfectly cooked with a warm reddish pink center and charred on the outside just like I like it.  Rapini was a bit bitter and could have used more garlic but hey who cares about that with a delicious steak.  I have no idea how much dinner would have been, but if I was to come to Vegas again and wanted a change of pace from what you can find on the strip I'd definitely come here again.",

When dining at Ruth's Chris, on Paradise, we asked our New Yorker Italian-American waiter for a suggestion for GOOD italian food in Las Vegas.  This was one of the places he recommended.  Located directly across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, on Paradise, we found Ferraro's to be a FABULOUS find.  We shared TWO appetizers... absolutely heavenly.  They make their own fresh mozzarella (soft and creamy with the savory prosciutto)... and the balsamic glaze was sheer perfection!     Burrata, Prosciutto, Rucola     Fresh mozzarella with a creamy center wrapped    with Parma prosciutto over arugula salad     Caprese di Bufala 14    Imported buffalo mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil,    extra virgin olive oil, balsamic glaze, pine nuts  Dinner... we went in two different directions:     Pappardelle Mimmo for me    Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter,    sage, truffle     Filetto di Manzo for my husband    Prime filet mignon topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms,    onions over arugula  My pappardelle was delicious.  A lovely balance between the seafood, the light sauce, asparagus, and the truffles.  After having split two appetizers, I took home half of my main course.  My husband said his filet was perfect!  He is quite picky and is not afraid to express any disappointment or hesitation.  Our waiter, Edward, was grand.  He spent time with each of us, explained the specials, the locals favorites, and asked about our preferences.  The additional table staff kept our glasses topped off, the bread replenished, oil and balsamic (and herbs) refreshed.  Excellent, all the way around.  I recommend Ferraro's without hesitation and greatly look forward to a return visit!",

Sampled the other entrees from dining campanions and was impressed with theirs as well. The service was outstanding - everyone was gracious and warm. Pricey? Not for the level of cuisine and service!",

This was our 2nd time to visit Vegas and the first time to visit Ferraro's.  We all had a wonder time and an excellent meal!  I chose Ferror's as I wanted to try out a local place and get away from the big hotels and casinos.  Ferraro's is about a 10 min cab ride from the Paris hotel.  If you go and you really should, be sure and ask for Walter.  The ladies in your party will appreciate it!",

The antipasto was decent, next time I am going to order the salsiccia calabrese (grilled calabrese sausage with polenta and red peppers). The wine menu is definitely a major attraction, there is so much to choose from and their cave is extensive - was overwhelemed so ended up ordering a few bottles with my group. I would definitely recommend getting a couple of plates and having courses as this is what the style is formatted for - traditional italian food - so order your antipastos, then maybe a salad, then get a couple of pasta dishes as well as a couple of main courses. I ordered the vitello piemontese and would rate it a 4,5 - exquisite, the truffle sauce was perfect, although not as tender as would have preferred a great main course. Other plates that I ordered were osso bucco and the pollo al limone.",

As much as I love Italian restaurants - it is not very often that I actually order pasta for dinner.  All I can say is thank goodness Ferraro's is not in my home town - I'd be as big as house.  Their ravioli's were simply amazing.  Hands down - the best I've had.  We split their ravioli special as an appetizer (which I'd highly recommend doing) and then had their veal chop which was also great - but the ravioli's were the star.

He took my friends still filled wine glass away without asking if she was done. He seemed sarcastic in the way he answered our questions.

The bar maid was not the best and the bartender made some mistakes while we were there, and he just poured it in another glass and added soda water to it.  The waiter reminded the bartender that alcohol should be added as well.  The bartender had been complaining that he had been working lots of hours and he came in early to eat.

Pizzas, sandwiches, salads... it is all what I expect from a higher end Italian place. I thought the calamari was a little too chewy though. But nothing that really struck me as 5 star worthy, especially with the prices charged.  Additionally, the ambiance is OK, basic wines and little green shrub things and some wood stuff.... nice decor. It seems very generic Italian high end though. Where is the True character? Also a few times they were playing some poppy italian music very loud, the VIP we had in town for business commented and had to have them turn it down. Not a good look.   I've just never had that \"wow\" moment here, culinary or service wise.  Maybe I need to come for dinner to get the full shabang. I will update this review if I do.",

I have always appreciate freshly made pasta, but the Pappardelle Mimmo was more than just the freshly made pasta.  I could tell the chef run the pasta over the pasta machine few extra times in order to get that perfect texture and thickness.  The sauce was amazing, I asked to be light on the butter and it came out perfect.  The scallops were not over done and finally there is someone who isn't stingy on the truffle.

    "text": "We often visit Vegas & like to eat off strip.  During our visit in January we decided to try an Italian restaurant & made reservations at Ferraro's on Paradise (shopping center with a CVS).   We made reservations for 8:00PM but our travels brought us back to Paradise closer to 7PM so we went in & asked if we might be seated - the hostess looked a little doubtful though the restaurant was still quiet ; she asked us to go to the bar until she could talk to a manager.  Lucky we did.  We met our nice waitress, Alyssa, who was so precious we decided to tell the hostess \"never mind\" to dine in the bar.  Our meal was excellent - we shared the Cappuccina con Gorgonzola salad which the kitchen nicely split.  The description said it had a \"ranch, balsamic dressing\" which sounded odd but Alyssa assured us it was good and sure enough, it was delicious.  We ordered a special that evening, lobster & asparagus ravioli which was light yet filling and so wonderful tasting.  I wanted to try the house made pasta & opted for the decadent spaghetti Carbonara, Piselli e Tartufi.  It was sooo good.  Their was accompanying bread & olive oil to complete our meal.  We were too full for desserts.  I could stop there but there were a couple more things that made Ferraro's special.  There was an underappreciated pianist providing background music in the bar.  After the happy hour ended, a Sinatra-esc vocalist joined the pianist.  Sitting by the stage we exchanged pleasantries throughout their night.  Gary Anthony, who we learned has a Frank Sinatra tribute show, came into the bar to join a group of apparent regulars. When two small boys walked through (one of whom ended up being the owner's son), I asked one to put some money in the jar for the entertainment.  A manager walking with the boys stopped at our table to provide a private magic show with disappearing & multiplying balls he would put into the boys' hands.  It was very cute & a pleasant addition to an already enjoyable evening.   Ferraro's is an old school type of restaurant with attendants in the restroom.  We had a wonderful meal, fun entertainment and a sweet, courteous & very efficient waitress.  We hope to see Alyssa on our next visit!  For those late night diners, their late (11PM-2AM) happy hour has half price dining & 25% off drinks!  Maybe we'll see you there!",

Like other secret gifts ... they come hidden away in surprising places ...  this one looks like an unassuming strip mall but once you enter it is an amazing and fantastic establishment.  Our waiter Alin was wonderful at helping us find something from the ridiculously comprehensive wine list ... it seems they have around 20,000 bottles on site so finding something needs a knowledgeable guide.  I fancy myself a bit addicted to pasta and meatballs ... one of my guilty pleasures and trying a new place it is one of my go to items simply because I feel safe trying a basic dish. The inhouse \"made from scratch pasta\" and sauce were simply the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD ! That says a lot as I have eaten in probably every state and have become a little bit of a snob regarding pasta. It was perfectly 'el dente' and the sauce had just the right amount zestiness. My girlfriend Stacey has a lactose limitation and they were happy to accommodate her and she was thrilled with her papparelli and meat sauce as well.  At the end of our meal Stacey asked if perhaps we could peak at the wine cellar and surprisingly despite being a very busy night the owner 'Gino' decided to personally tour us through the cellar and his kitchen!  Simply put ... a FANTASTIC dining experience ! Thank you Gino and Alin for such a memorable night!!   YOU OWE YOURSELF A TREAT ... make a reservation !!",

I prefer light breaded calamari's Italian-style, so they had the exact breading I was hoping for. However, it started to fall off the calamari so quickly. :/  Meatballs and polenta cake- 5/5. These meatballs were amazing, and the sauce was very good.   Bianca pizza- 3/5. Not too shabby, but crust was decent.   Bucatini bolognese- 3/5 stars. The portion is tiny. I wasn't really digging' the pasta that reminded me of worms.   Arancini (fried rice balls with truffle oil) - 3/5 stars. It was alright.   Nice ambiance, and great place for a date night. I may come back and try their pasta dishes on their regular menu, but that may not e for a while.",

If you're looking for authentic, real Italian food, you've come to the right place!   First off, its family owned with their own family recipes. The owners still run it and were there when we came.   All of the staff is very seasoned and knowledgable. I'm talking grown ass men who serve here as a career and know how to wine and dine.   Our server made us our own specialty appitizer course that was perfect and just what we expressed we would like.   They have the top list of wines in the US and 10th top Globally! Crazy, right? They even have a wine specialist (Real Italian man that has to be in his late 60's) who came to our table to see what we were looking for a made suggestions on wine's we would like. He recommended one that he personally knew the family of that was beyond amazing.   The food was so authentic and rich it was like anything i've ever had.   Definitely a great atmosphere and perfect for wining and dining customers or friends and family.   This will be my new go-to when i'm in town!",

We were greeted with so unhappy hostess, asked if we wanted to be inside or patio, we then decided to go to the patio because it's a nice and quiet ambiance. We were sat and was offered a book of their wines and drinks. We asked our server (I forgot his name because he was never around) to give us a minute to decide what to order. He came back and we were struggling what to order because I was unfamiliar of authentic Italian food. We then decided to get their appetizer combo, which are: shaved carrots with mozzarella, grilled octopus and beef tartar. After ordering, we were given pieces of bread, no utensils or napkins, I even had to get the attention of one of their bussers.. don't understand why are they not being attentive to their guests and needs.. anyway, we also ordered two drinks which are the Mediterranean mule and blood orange martini, (ALSO TOOK 15 mins to come) our food came and we were surprised that we got one of each of the appetizers because our server didn't bother explaining that it is not shareable and both guests are getting the same thing. Mozzarella with carrots was so bland, grilled octopus was just too oily and the beef tartar is just a slice of meat and some leaf... VERY DISAPPOINTED! We were so unhappy and frustrated that we couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant!! We were supposed to order an entree and dessert but we both totally lost our appetite. We asked for our check and our server asked if there was anything wrong because he can see that our food was barely touched and eaten. I then, explained to him that we did not like the food at all and all he did was shake his head and say awww... IM SORRY ABOUT THAT.... we spent 75$ for 2 combo appetizers and 2 drinks and our server didn't even try to make us feel better, because if this happened in other restaurant, the food would've been comped or we were asked if there is anything else we would like... thanks to the amazing employees for making our 4th anniversary the MOST MEMORABLE ANNIVERSARY yet!!! NEVER EVER GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE.. DONT EVEN BOTHER. I don't ever leave such bad reviews but our time spent here was a waste, money down the drain SO we are never coming back.   Our dinner was at 7:30 today (MAY 22,2017) in the patio. I don't know the server's name, I hope next time you can make your guests happy and have a memorable night with great food and experience.",

    "text": "My wife and I had reservations for 5:15 p.m. on a Thursday. We probably didn't need them, though, as we walked in and were immediately seated by the hostess. Gino Ferraro and his wife Rosealba greeted us at the door and remained there at least until we left, welcoming every customer that walked in.  Immediately after we were seated, our server Eric came over and began taking care of us. He described the daily specials, got our drink orders, and even helped my wife make up her mind as to what to order (she's really indecisive when it comes to getting dinner at a new place).  I got the Filleto di Manzo with the Pasta e Fagioli appetizer, my wife got the Risotto Arogosta with a side order of Insalata Mimmo. The food took a little while to get out to our table but the staff kept us busy with our appetizers, bread, and their delicious garlic oil. The Fagioli was a True Italian fagioli, with chicken stock and short pasta. It was delicious and flavorful. The Insalata was caprese-style with chunks of mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, and avocado. The wife raved.  The food, once it arrived, was well worth the wait. The Filetto (a 10-ounce tenderloin) was deftly seasoned and seared to a  perfect medium rare. It came on a bed of winter greens (with rapini, Brussels sprouts, green onions, and asparagus) and a delicious beef reduction sauce. The wife's Risotto was cooked perfectly al dente. The lobster was fresh and her only complaint was that the marscapone-based sauce was very rich and she was too full from the salad to finish the whole thing.   After dinner, we were too full to even contemplate dessert, but Eric insisted in bringing out a sampler plate of two of their desserts: tiramisu and cannoli. Both were wonderful. Had I the room, a full order would have happened.  Bottom line, Ferraro's is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. From the family atmosphere to the friendly and attentive service to the superb food, Ferraro's did not miss a note all night. We will certainly be going back.",

He had no idea it was my birthday, but went above and beyond to make our general experience there memorable. He was always there to answer questions, our drinks were never empty, and his upbeat personality was contagious. He brought us a few things to sample, just because. I also couldn't decide between two entrees and he mentioned he would try to get me half of one and half of the other. And to my surprise, he followed through.   The food was amazing. We started with the Burrata salad and my taste buds were doing tiny little dances. I'm a Burrata freak (one of the reasons I went to this restaurant was because it was on the menu). My boyfriend had the lasagna, which is unlike any lasagna I've ever tasted, but in the best way possible. I can't remember the names of the pastas I had, but based on what I ate, I think one would be hard-pressed to find one they didn't like.   The night ended with some live Jazz music (which may have been our favorite part). I'm not really a Yelper, I don't really write many reviews, but I was so blown away by our experience there I had to make sure this restaurant gets the great review and Apollo is recognized for his amazing service. Whenever I'm back in Vegas, I'm 100% making another stop here.",

    "text": "A firm believer that eating in the right place can be one of life's great catharses it was after a particularly difficult week that three guests sat down to dinner at Ferraro's Italian Restaurant and Wine Bar, Gino and son Mimmo greeting each patron at the door of a place that has survived the test of time by doing things the right way and making each guest feel as though they are family.  Serving Las Vegas for thirty-three years when many would-be Restaurateurs cannot survive six months, this alone a testament to what Ferraro's offers even before taking a look at the Menu or Wine list, it was in a rounded booth bridging Restaurant and Bar that the party was sat before a familiar server appeared tableside, deference to Chef Francesco Di Caudo the only way to order for those to whom only the best will suffice.  Busy for an August night Off-Strip, a time when even the best see books bleed Red, it was in traditional fashion that dinner began with a brisk glass of Bubbles plus housemade Bread and Olive Oil, an opening trio offering three familiar dishes to each guest in individual portions while a shared plate from the seasonal menu celebrating Veneto was a marvelous one not frequently featured in Vegas featuring tender Salt Cod in creamy Potatoes.  Always impressed by Ferraro's Burrata and Octopus, the rolled Carpaccio surprisingly also gathering praise from one diner who is not fond of Arugula, it was while Primi were being prepared that a bonus dish of chilled Noodles topped in Lemon and Caviar refreshed the palate, bold flavors all in harmonious balance and absolutely dazzling when paired to Prosecco.  Next pouring 2010 San Lorenzo Montepulciano d'Abruzzo to drink with four Pastas and a Risotto, the Oak at times a little overwhelming but pleasant with Tomato-topped Potato Dumplings and hollow Spaghetti lent a lot of heat by Red Pepper, suffice it to say that Di Caudo's skills are best displayed by subtle dishes including Ravioli matching Beet to Sesame or an impeccable off-menu Risotto featuring Rice with just a bit of bite amidst Cheese, Black Pepper and nearly raw King Crab Meat.  Diving deep with Spaghetti al Nero from the Veneto Menu, every diner left with blackened teeth but bright smiles thanks to the impressive balance achieved by way of Tomato Fondue mixed with tender rings of Squid and beautifully cooked Shrimp, it was after a brief but welcomed pause that three entrees joined bright 2009 Arcanum Il Fauno, a bowl of \"Moscardini in Umido\" also featuring Cephalopod offering a lot of brine that finds its foil in fresh Peas and Polenta.  Unable to let two first-timers leave Ferraro's without tasting the Ossobuco, one of those rare dishes that earns a title of \"World Famous\" thanks to spoon-tender Veal melting from the bone into Farro bathed in Red Wine and rendered Juices, it was already well sated that additional space was found for medium-rare Lamb Chops served alongside a stack of tender Eggplant, though admittedly one was left over in order to save room for Dolci.   Taking Espresso alongside Dessert and following with Ferraro's Limoncello, as traditional an Italian end as any, it was again with a trio of classics that the finale got underway, an off-menu Cannoli particularly impressive thanks to subtle notes of Citrus though for those with limited capacity after such a meal the best choice remains a sampling of Rosalba's Italian Cookies or the almost impossibly light Pistachio Passion.  Relaxing for a bit after settling the tab, the crowd now died down and music lightly playing overhead, it was with a final gift from Chef Di Caudo that slices of funky Sheep's Milk Cheese played off housemade Gelato and Streusel, another off-menu inspiration that further attests to why Ferraro's remains relevant after three decades and shows no signs of slowing.",

Exceptional service, too. We started with grilled octopus as an appetizer, which was lemony and grilled to perfection. The Burrata salad was delicious; the spicy carrots and almond pesto gave it such a unique flavor combination. I got the Pappardelle Mimmo as my entree and it was very good. The Ossobuco is their specialty, and others at my table got it. I was told it was so tender that it could be cut with a fork. While we were dining, the owners sat at a nearby table, doing a wine tasting. They sent over complimentary desserts at the end of our dinner. Such a nice touch! I hope to return sometime.",

We parked in a back alley type deal and took a short walk up.   Our server was great! He was full of suggestions and had a great attitude and smile, but not too in your face. Very professional.   I ordered the Osso Buco. I was so happy to hold my baby marrow fork! It was delicious, inside and out. My friend had the bucatini, which was exploding with fresh flavours. The pasta was freshly made in-house, and you can definitely tell. Bravo. We finished off with tiramisu, even though the entrees were so filling. Glad we did because it was divine.   The bill was about $110 for the two dishes and dessert. We were extremely pleased.",

They make the pasta and all the sausages right there in the restaurant every day. All the food is homemade.   I am so glad we just popped in this place. Our waiter Eric was absolutely superb. We didn't even need a sommelier (they have one though) because he picked out a wonderful red wine for me. All the assistant guys standing around...if you just look up they are there and anticipating what you need like they're psychic. A sign of fine dining is not having to hunt someone down to get what you want.   You must go here when in Vegas if you want an AUTHENTIC, romantic and elegant meal. Please open a restaurant in Chicago. My husband is kind of in big trouble because I was spoiled that night and he's just going to have to take me back....I do have a girl's trip in June so I'll see you then!!!",

I haven't had such a thoughtful and attentive server in a long time, especially since for the most part I genuinely am happy as long as they have an alcohol menu and good food quality. Service alone deserved 5 stars.   I ordered the pappardelle mimmo & it was pretty good. I honestly love that all our pastas turned out al dente with perfect texture & the complementing sauces were delicious and subtle in flavor and aromatics. We shared everything so we could try multiple plates and honestly, it was all quite good. the dessert that we got to finish off the meal was \"Josh-recommended,\" and was a great way to end the meal. Great combination of textures & beautiful subtle flavors of pistachio and rich contrast of cheesecake & graham cracker crust finished with crisp walnuts on top. this was a great dinner-after-work experience and I'm definitely thankful we came. Great job Ferraro team.",

Actually the wait staff gets five stars too - very busy night, but they were on time with every phase of the meal; the desert & coffee and the delivery of the check.

But Zorans disrespect of me tonight overshadows the food, a and ruined my culinary experience tonight, (after a 6 hour drive to get to Vegas for my 2nd conference here in 10 days).  He didn't let me speak 3 words without interrupting me over Nd over. He refused to listen to me about an allergy, and denied again and again that it was in my food.  When I asked to speak to chef, Zoran huffed away that I was inconveniencing him. Chef verified what Zoran denied 6-7 times: that my allergen was in the food.  I left hungry and in tears. I called you from out front and asked the manager to please come out and talk to me. He said he was busy with other customers and did not come out.  Tomorrow, I speak at a conference at a resort across the street, ironically, on how to provide excellent customer service.  I will be using my experience as a case study how not to treat customers.  And I will never refer my 3,800 students to Ferarros again.  What really stinks is that as a foodie, I've got a list of your menu items I WAS dying to experience. My dinner at the bar last week was wonderful, and my waiter incredible.  I highly suggest you encourage Zoran to learn how to communicate with customers by LISTENING first, and NOT loudly berate them. Other diners were watching him BULLY ME.  It was humiliating. :-(",

Brought my girl here for her first time. She had the risotto with lobster. I had the peppardell (sp?) with lobster, scallops, etc.  it was amazing.    Started with the carpaccio which was off the hook as well.  Had a couple great glasses of wine and finished with the tiramasou. Holy hell! Talk about legit.  Best part of the night was our server, Tom.  Great guy, professional, cool, knowledgeable, and just a great, all around experience.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be there and I'll be in his section!",

    "text": "Wawaweewa!  I had lunch at Ferraro's today, and I must say, this place is a True gem in Vegas.  I'd been here once before for an Elite event, and remember the good times, and great food, but I wrote a review for the event. Now, I am proud to write this review and share this lovely restaurant with you.  The lunch menu is fairly simple ($10 per dish). Each item comes with house salad or soup. Get the salad with their house dressing. It's a fantastic balsamic vinaigrette. The plate is glazed with a balsamic reduction for show. And it's sexy.  My Dad and I ordered the Chicken Parm. It came with a side of rigatoni. It was so nice, The chicken was nicely breaded and crispy. Not oily, but had a baked in taste.  My angel of a mother had the Salmon which was topped with a lemon caper sauce, and also had a side of rigatoni. It was a fantastic combo.  The dinner menu is a bit more upscale ($25-$50), but I recommend this place for any special meal. The restaurant has been in business for over 25 years, and they know what they are doing.  Come here for the following:  A special date. Don't bring an ONS here.  An announcement dinner: \"We're getting married: A business lunch or dinner with clients. Bachelor party looking for a classy dinner before a night of debauchery.  They have several wines available (and even wine lockers for the ballers). The beer selection is pretty good too.  Make it happen. This is your spot.",

    "text": "Took my Mom and Dad here during a quick stop to Las Vegas. Early celebration of my Mom's birthday. Got their for an early 6PM reservation on Thursday. Place was hopping by the time we were on dessert. Food was great.  Had lots of food and everything was good.  Hightlights included the grilled shrimp with beans as an appetizer, the papperdele with shellfish entree and the veal chop.  Portions were large. Everything cooked perfect. Service was very good, along with recommendations that were spot on.  I mentioned pre-dinner that we were celebrating my Mom's birthday and they brought all of us some tiramisu and a mini cannoli for dessert, along with a candle for my Mom. Nice touch. This place is a bit expensive but well worth it.  See you again during my next visit to Las Vegas. Great to get out of casino restaurants. This place has been around a long time. They used to be in another location and called Mimmo Ferraro's. You don't last in this town (or many places) if you are not consistent. Check it out. You won't be disappointed if you want to great old world Italian food.",

For happy hour we ordered about $50 worth of food for two (4 happy items) which would be fine for a nicer place.

Same with the other three items. Happy hour is just supposed to be discounted food, not less food for less money. Never go here for happy hour!!

They featured a 4 course meal for $30.30 in celebration of their 30th anniversary but the menu was a big disappointment. Appetizers were good. The mini baguette was very good. The intermediate course, a house salad was the most rustic and an item that should not be in a fine dining restaurant, mixed greens tossed in an over acidic balsamic vinaigrette. The Lasagna was mediocre, you can even see the comparison with other pictures on Yelp, they hold the garnish to save some pennies. The dessert was nothing special, a small piece of tiramisu and a hard to eat cannoli.  The wine list is super over priced. I was looking for a good value Barbera or Langhe Nebbiolo for about $50 dollars but it was a mission impossible. They have the most expensive Italian wine list I've ever seen. If you can afford Gaja and Masseto this might be your place. I am sure there are a lot of great Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas Strip to try.  The owner is famous for his hospitality, however we sat in the waiting area for 50 minutes waiting for our table with our baby and he never came by even to say hi.  I guess he only shows his hospitality to the rich regular guest who patronize his establishment.",

My waitstaff of choice since my very first visit at the new location has been Walter. Ferraro's has excellent servers and bartenders throughout the house, but Walter has been my choice from day one one Paradise. Mimo, the owner is without a doubt the penultimate hands-on owner whose one focus is for his customers to be treated like family, and served a meal they cannot wait to tell their friends about.  All of my guests that have enjoyed the Ferraro experience ask during the year if we are going to  go back again when we are in Vegas. I love this, bcause it has been my calling card. While my competition spends way too much at one of the Strip Hotels for a meal not even close to Ferraro's, I am creating memories of a first class dinner with a perfect wine for every meal.  Due to many circumstances it has been three years since I have seen my friends at Ferraro's. But, I am back this year and cannot wait to see the entire crew. My biggest problem is deciding between the Osso Bucco, the Pasta with Caviar, and which Brunello to complete the deal.  Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy this masterpiece in a city that offers lots of pricey alternatives, but, few that creates memories of a lovely evening out.",

A good friend was hosting a party there to celebrate the launch of his new company.  For hors d'oeuvre we were served slices of Cheese Pizza, Sausage Pizza, Risotto Balls, and Sausage w/Marinara Sauce.....all of them were awesome.  Once we were seated, we were served Gnocchi w/Marinara Sauce & Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce for Appetizers.  For a Salad we were served a salad w/Heirloom Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, Avocado, and Red Onion.....this was soooo good too!  For an Entree, I chose the Filet w/Wild Mushrooms in a Veal demi-glaze reduction while the Better Half chose the Fresh Seabass.....a couple of friends ordered Ferraro's World Famous Oso Buco......we loved them all!  And to finish the dinner, we had Tiramisu & Cannolis....what!!!  I think I died and went to heaven!  Plus the wine was free flowing all night long.....I can't remember how many glasses I put away.....ha!  I hate to sound like such a Homer, but this was a really really good experience from beginning to end.  Will I return?  F-U-H-G-E-T-T-A 'B-O-U-T I-T!",

I was the most disappointed in the steak. For $16, I literally received three thin slices not even large enough to make a sandwich out of. Similar to the thinly sliced lunch meat sold in stores. The smell was horrible, full of vinegar, I threw it in the trash can. I'm not sure if I was skimped by the restaurant or the delivery driver ate the most of it. The salad was mere lettuce with one large white onion chopped on top. I hate onions!! It was also a waste. I will never order from this restaurant again. When reading the ingredients, it noted that red onion were used. I didn't expect a whole onion chopped on top of it. Very disappointing.",

We found out that Ferraro's had moved to a new location very close to the strip. The restaurant is easy to get to and beautifully decorated. We sat in a booth that overlooked the room and were impressed with the attentive service and gourmet food. The caesar salad was to die for and I had the veal and my husband the osso bucco. Everything was 5 star and the staff could not do enough for you. They did not rush you, making the evening memorable. We would definitely recommend this restaurant highly!!!!",

If you go during happy hour during the week they have an extremely price-conscious venue however they do not skimp on quality. They also have an extensive collection of Italian wines. Should I ever make it back to Las Vegas I will visit this establishment again. it's nice because it's away from the casinos and that means you don't have a bunch of crazy drunk people running around generally. The wait staff is extremely attentive and is eager to please. My food compares to some of the best Italian cuisine I've had in other places in the United States",

There are so many great restaurants all within a half-mile radius of Ferraro's and and  the restaurant definitely stood out exuding its over 25 years of charming, old-world elegant presence.   The interior decor is classical Italian. A bar is located to the left upon entering the restaurant. People can order drinks while waiting. Plenty of great seating on the outer patio offering nice ambiance and the area is particularly wonderful on a cool evening under the heated lamps and round fire pits.  All of the dishes served were very well-prepared with great depth of flavor. The caprese and the osso buco were espcially excellent. Dessert was most decadent and delightful.  - Appetizer trio:  ravioli, crab cake and seared scallop - Caprese di Bufala - heirloom tamatoes, buffalo mozzarella, pine nuts - Osso buco - Braised veal shank with farro grain - Filetto di Manzo - 8oz prime filet mignon topped with mushrooms - Dessert - cannoli and tiramisu  Service was excellent. Valet parking available. Will definitely return to sample other dishes on their menu.",

Walter has a fantastic personality. He is very vivacious and funny. He came to the table in a very timely manner and it was a very busy Friday night. He greeted us with a great big smile and welcomed us to Ferraro's. He had great knowledge of the menu, thoroughly explained the specials of the evening and offered wonderful suggestions. I had the Pappardelle Mimmo and it was the best pasta I've ever had. My family loved their dishes as well. Walter brought to the table a piece of tiramisu with a candle in it and a cannoli for my mom and all of us at the table and it was creamy and delicious. We all thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Ferraro's. Everyone made us feel so welcomed, we had fantastic service from Walter, the food was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. It is really a restaurant for all occasions and Ferraro's comes highly highly recommended to family and friends!",

    "text": "We were recommended Ferraro's by our Uber driver, who touted it as a local favorite.  It was 11:30 pm on a Saturday and we were trying to find something to eat other than fast food or bar bites.  Ferraro's had the best late-night menu I've ever encountered. I was expecting some Italian comfort food (spaghetti, lasagna, you know the type) and instead they offered first-class, authentic mediterranean cuisine.  I had the sea bass (branzino) and my friend had the calebresi.  The food was absolutely delicious and of completely unexpected quality again because of the late hour.    The environment was perfect for either a romantic date in the dining area, a group dinner, or just grabbing a glass of wine at their bar.  I had the house white, which was a more than generous portion.  Toward the end of our evening, the manager, who appeared to be on a first-name basis with several of the other customers, brought us out a complimentary plate with cannoli and tiramisu.  Our total price for the night, including salads, 2 entrees, and wine was only $70- half of what I would expect for such an excellent meal for dinner.    4 stars instead of 5 since service was a bit slow, but it was also extremely busy and there were only 2 bartenders, so that's understandable.   Definitely visiting again!  Next time for a regular dinner for the full experience.",

    "text": "This review is late but definitely needed.  Let me start be saying I adore Ferraros- the food and staff have always been awesome. Until this visit for the 30th anniversary...  Super deal on a 4 course meal- $30 and change! Awesome!  Called to make a reservation ahead of time letting them know we wanted to do the happy hour and the anniversary special and would like to be seated accordingly- the gal who took the reservation said no problem.  Checked in for the res the night of and they put our table on the dining side where you can't order from the happy hour menu. Talked to the hostess about the reservation and she said it'd be a 20 min wait. At this point, fine. We'll just wait at the bar until they figure this out.  A friend had a $100 gift card and bought our first round of drinks! Awesome! Well by the time she was able to order, they had the table ready for us. So half of us never got our drinks. Bartender did acknowledge that he owed us our drinks. Problem is, the drinks never came.  Well, neither did a server. The bussers were quick to bring water and bread which was nice. But we waited 20 minutes and no one came to give us menus or help us. I went to the hostess letting her know that no one has helped us, she said she would get someone. 10 more minutes passed and I had to stop someone to help us. He gave us menus & took our app orders and never came back. 15 more minutes passed and we had to wave another person down because we had no food & no drinks and were ready to order our entrees and beverages....and the guy who initially helped us was nowhere to be found. Add insult to injury, from the moment we were sat, there were a number of servers who just passed us by without checking on us. Even the table next to us was being helped. That's unacceptable.  Finally we got a female server to be our \"regular\" server. Explained about the drink situation and she said she'd get those for us. She was nice but still didn't really check on our table. One of my friends had to search for her for the check as we were just sitting around waiting for quite some time, long after all the plates were cleared and the glasses were dry (including water).  When we got the bill, they charged us full price for everything AND charged us for drinks that we had already paid for at the bar. One of the staff was trying to explain to my friend that they can't honor the anniversary price since she was using a coupon. But she wasn't using a coupon, it was a gift card. They came back with a somewhat corrected bill and told my friend that they took off certain drinks since she used her \"discount\" on it at the bar. DISCOUNT?! Since when is full tender in which you use to pay for services a DISCOUNT?! It's not.  Not to mention our reservation was for 5:45pm and we didn't walk out until 9:40pm.   As much as I loved this place, this experience created such a foul taste that I don't think I'll be able to give it another chance for quite some time.  Additionally, they have a \"rewards\" program that doesn't work. The average I've spent on visits here has been $150+ and I'd come several times a month, sometimes several times a week and not once has a reward come through. So if you see the paper in your bill to sign up, there's no point in wasting your time with it.",

I chose Lobster ravioli as my main course.  It had a very strong fish taste and limited lobster meat on top.  I expected more for a $60 meal.   I feel as though I wasted a meal in Vegas.

Had a nice bite, but was smooth at the same time - The octopus appetizer was perfectly garlicky.  The octopus was firm, yet tender.  Very good - My main, a pasta dish with spicy sausage and uni, sounded unique and inspired.  It wasn't very good.  A B for trying, but it just didn't meld.  At all  I could bump this place up a star with a subsequent visit and by selecting my entree a little more wisely.  Stay tuned.",

I ordered the lobster risotto and it was slightly salty but flavorful and creamy. It was portioned just right. Gf loved the cappacino at the end, especially since it came with a rock sugar candy stick that elevated the cappacino experience from a \"meh normal Capp\" to a \"whoa amazing.\"",

The wine list is incredible and the sommelier is very knowledgeable.  I order the branzino fish which was outstanding. It was fresh and tasty.  The pasta dish we ordered as an appetizer was one of the best simple pastas that I have ever eaten.  I do not know how they made simple pasta taste so good. It has to be the seasoning.  I would return to this restaurant whenever I am in Las Vegas. It is not cheap but it is reasonably priced. Far better value and quality of food than what is offered on the \"strip.\" Bravo",

    "text": "We came here on Valentine's day with another couple. Yes, it was our fault for not making reservation earlier so it was nice of them to still accommodate us. We sat at a table without white table cloth but that shouldn't mean terrible service right?   Firstly, our server didn't look too happy and was totally out of it. We asked for a drink menu so he got it for us alright. He plopped a THICK drink menu and just left. No recommendations, no nothing. When we finally got his attention and asked for recommendations, his response was \"There's a table of contents here.\" When we gave up, we ordered a bottle of house red cabernet sauvignon (which was still 60usd, so not cheap). As for the meal, we made it easy for the server, we each got the valentine menu (90USD, so not cheap again) even though the restaurant still offered their regular menu (which probably cost less too).  When the first plate arrived, presentation looked nice. So I was excited because at this point we were so hungry. However, I got excited too early. The food was cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile. First course, we ordered was the bone marrow. It  was tasteless; not seasoned well. Second course, the best course of all, was the lobster ravioli. This dish was salty but it had fresh chunks of lobster and at least it wasn't soggy. Third course was the medium rare steak. I'm a huge fan of steaks but this steak was so tough and chewy that I lost interest in it. Lastly, is the dessert. It is a trio but only one out of the three was yummy.   Because the server was so out of it and our friends were in a rush to a show, we didn't say or complain about it. Since it was on Valentine's day, it was even more disappointing. I'm just glad the busser for our table that day was friendly. I do not understand how this restaurant has such a high rating. I recommend you to add a few bucks and eat at a celebrity chef or Michelin star/ Forbes rating restaurant. Sadly, in my opinion, this place is not worth wasting your calories on. There are definitely many better Italian restaurants out there... Just saying.",

Arrived 5:55 no parking spots tried to valet waited 15 minutes still no valet looked around found a parking spot my the CVS drug store. Fought are way through the homeless people to get to the restaurant and we were told due to our being late our reserved table with the waiter who recommended this place was gone. When I explained we were late because your valet service was non existent it didn't matter and the gentlemen never did investigate what was going on with his valet as it was chaos when we left an hours later.  The food was incredibly disappointing my fiance had Lasagna which was small portion and flavorless honestly a frozen grocery store bought lasagna has more flavor. I had veal scaloppine which was again a small portion and again had no flavor from the sauce. The veggie that came with it was awful. Service was outstanding as was the atmosphere.   This place is an enigma as to why it has such a large following with average store bought Italian food level quality??? As hilarious as it sounds Olive Garden has better food? We were hoping for a great meal from a well known local family owned restaurant and instead we got a meal you might find in an average casino or amusement park. Wouldn't try it again as there weren't any mistakes made with the food that was how it comes on a daily basis.",

I been to tons of fancy restaurants in California and all over America.   The evenings specials were all unique to the original menu. I went with the 20 ounce rib eye and the gf went with the Chilean Sea Bass. The steak was cooked to perfection and the side of rustic potatoes were crispy thru the end.   I tried her sea bass, and I can honestly say that it was the best fish dish I've had in my life. The fish had salty roasted peppers on the side and it perfectly complimented the delicate fish. It was literally melting in my mouth. My steak was perfect, but I could not stop eating her Chilean Sea bass.   The service was one of the best I have ever experienced. I am not just saying this because the food so good it blinded me. The service was really top notch.  Our waiter, the older bald gentleman, sorry I can't remember his name. Was really attentive and genuine with his speech. He wasn't over bearing or overly friendly to the point where it annoying. Straight to the point and very prompt with everything.   I been to  masteros and it is one of the most pretentious places on the planet. I am pretty sure masteros gave my gf a usda choice cut of steak and charged us for prime because they thought we are young and wouldn't notice the difference. I have a feeling a lot of high end restaurants do this. They have cheaper cuts on the side for suckers that they think won't notice the difference.    Anyway, forget all other restaurants, I will recommend all my friends to Ferraaro's. Don't be fooled by the plaza. Go in and try the sea bass",

    "text": "This is a traditional Italian restaurant with Maui flare. Even though it is at the four seasons and beachside, the service and menu are unpretentious, just good. The homemade chibatta bread has a perfectly crunchy crust with a chewy middle, and is a nice compliment to the homemade pasta dishes. I had the spaghetti with shrimp, but opted for a red sauce instead of the Alfredo. My husband order the lamb tagliatelle and he said it was cooked perfectly. The service (Gerry was our server) is spot on, as is their wine list. But overall you go to Ferraro's for its view. Ask for an outside table at sunset and you won't be disappointed. Hands down, one of the most romantic spots on the island!",

    "text": "First off, I would like to say that the negative reviews on here are absolutely absurd. I am a frequent flier to Las Vegas and my father-in-law suggested this lovely Italian restaurant that he's been frequenting for over thirty years.   The food is exquisite! Hands down one of the top meals I have had in my life. My husband always orders the Osso Buco which doesn't require the knife they provide, as it falls right off the bone. The best part is the tiny fork that given so the marrow can be eaten. It's cooked perfectly and is heavenly on the palate.  Any of the Risotto dishes are classically prepared, rich and creamy and full of flavor. The lobster ravioli is heavenly and light. Like little pockets of clouds bursts with bold flavor.  Most importantly, I cannot forget to mention Mr. Geno, the owner of this fine establishment. He is truly passionate about his restaurant and his customers. He is a genuinely nice guy and actually sits with his customers just to see how they are doing and to ask if your meals were to your liking. At our last visit in May 2015, We had an amazing waiter Joquain, who was always there for any of our needs and provided unparalleled service. This place really makes you feel like an extended part of the family and being married into an Italian family, I recognize the importance of that.",

    "text": "We made a reservation for Valentine's day and even showed up 30 minutes early to ensure we got a table. The place was practically empty around 6 p.m. so we tarried by the bar. I ordered a vodka martini and my boyfriend got a scotch neat so we can't say much about the quality of the cocktails. The bartender didn't offer us recommendations or selections, much less talk, so this might not be one of those places to strike up a conversation.  Food: Excellent. We started with a charcuterie plate of cheeses and cured meats. Nothing fancy or worth stating. It was pretty plain: a plate of meats and cheeses. For dinner, I had a lobster ravioli and my boyfriend got steak. The pasta was al dente and lobster was just right. The sauce wasn't heavy or too light either. Finished up with some creme brulee which wasn't stellar, but good for flamed custard.   Service: Up to par. Since it was Valentine's day, the restaurant got busier later in the evening. However, this did not diminish our server's presence nor her service. She gave us a wine menu and suggested pairings which I appreciate because sommeliers can be nerve-racking if you don't know your wines.   Overall: It might've been the wine talking, but I enjoyed myself. The food was lovely and my mouth waters thinking about the lobster ravioli.   Less one star because booths and tables are really close. Upscale Italian? Meh. It felt like an Olive Garden on steroids. Less kitschy Italian homeware replicas, but still that sort of faux interior facade. Good to wow a date and special occasions, but that's about it.",

Our waitress was rude and unfriendly, she only came by when she had too and  the meal was overpriced for what we received. I would suggest you save your money and go to Olive Garden.

    "text": "What a bad experience! We booked this place weeks ago for a business and entrepreneurs meeting early in the afternoon (4.30 to 5.30PM). We are a group of about 10 people, potentially interested into bringing business to this restaurant, with our professional network and on a private plan. Well, this is NOT going to happen! They offered us a nice table to sit at. We placed our food and drinks order. Then the waiter came back to us saying we had to leave because this was kind of a high-end table, and each of us would have to spend at least $200 if we wanted to stay there. Let's have a quick maths lesson here: 10 people, $200 each. That makes $2,000 during a supposed happy hour time. Plus the place was empty, nobody was waiting for this table. Anyway, $2,000. Now, let's have the ten of us coming back... Let's say at least 5 times a year, to be fair. With at least 2 other people each time. With an average ticket of about $75 per person. $11,250. Dear manager, you just lost at least $9,250 within 15 minutes. Plus a very bad opinion from the 10 of us, and we are going to spread the word, I swear. This is a perfect example of bad marketing and management. Congratulations!",

After ordering appetizers and our main course, my son and I split a salad. It was good until my son found a staple in his salad. The waiter was apologetic and took the plate to the chef.  He came back and said there would be no charge for the salad and he would get us dessert. Because we were on the way to the airport, we said we would have to pass on the dessert so he took off a glass of wine that my son had ordered.  The waiter mentioned they could not understand the origin of the staple, almost suggesting it was not their responsibility.  That attitude on the way our was also displayed by the manager and it sounded as if it was a \"special favor\" not to charge for the salad and a glass of wine.  Seems to me that the danger of that item in the food was not considered that serious by the restaurant.  Shame on them",

You can't go wrong with the wine list (which is literally a book). The flavors are rich and vibrant, just like you'd except from your Italian grandma-ma. Even the dinner bread they give every table had Italian herbs baked into them and they were freshly baked.  It's an institution off of the strip to be sure, and the cabaret music act was your classic middle-aged man who has tanned everyday of his life and gets his hear done daily. And wears sunglasses inside. I mean, it's amazing. The music was not too loud to talk over and the singers were very talented.  They have a bar area, a formal dining room, a back room for private parties and events, and a beautiful patio. I will be back again!

    "text": "We went looking for a local Italian restaurant to avoid the rip-off prices of the hotels on the Las Vegas Strip our concierge at the hotel who lives in Las Vegas knew  exactly what this ex-new Yorker was looking for. She recommended Ferraro's saying that it was as close to the real New York Italian food I was looking for and she was spot-on. From the manager's recommendation of a good Italian wine from an enormous selection to Michael our waiter, our experience couldn't have been better. The food was excellent for the four of us, even preparing an excellent saltimbocca I wanted that wasn't on the menu. We were \"ALL\" very impressed and satisfied and would recommend Ferraro's to anyone looking for an authentic Italian meal in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Every experience I have had prior to tonight's Thanksgiving dinner at Ferraro's has been wonderful. I brought my parents for the anniversary tasting menu during their visit this past summer, and they loved it so much they brought a group of friends from Illinois out to try it a few months later. So when I saw the ad for the Thanksgiving dinner offering, and my parents were visiting again, it seemed like a homerun.   Sadly, we were all very disappointed. The menu was set and you were not able to order anything but the special menu--no substitutions. We all decided to try the Thanksgiving menu: 4 courses including soup/salad, pasta, turkey dinner, and dessert. The salads were great, and the pasta dish (sweet potato gnocchi) was bland but ok. The turkey dinner was horrible. The turkey was a turkey roll. No doubt about it, clearly heavily processed and more than likely frozen. The mashed potatoes had zero flavor (which was strange given that there was garlic chunks in them) and it was hard to tell what was saltier: the gravy or the turkey roll.   When I spoke to the manager he stated that the turkey was fresh--the cook deboned the turkeys and rolled them--but it was obviously processed. When I expressed my disappointment, the manager stated they had sold 300 dinners and had no complaints. This was odd as we could clearly see those who ordered the turkey were not sending back empty plates. More than anything it's just a huge disappointment as we decided not to make a traditional home cooked Thanksgiving dinner based on our previous experiences at Ferraro's; none of us finished our meals this time and it's unlikely we will return.   For Italian food, they are great. But they need the stick to what they know.",

Food tastes good.  Wasn't a fan of the red peppers in the calamari.  Giving an unbiased opinion about the place because I'm not a fan of Italian food. Came here because we had a gift card.

The interior has a very nice ambiance but I elected to be seated on the patio since it was a nice night.  The wine list is by far the most extensive one I have ever seen.  Being by myself, I opted for the house red (free with my Yelp check-in) which was still a very nice wine.  For starters I ordered the pasta e fagioli soup, a great choice.  Not being that hungry, I had the Paglia e Fieno bolognese which is comparable to anything I have tasted in my travels thru Italy.",

    "text": "This is the best meal I've ever had. I don't say that lightly either because I typically am underwhelmed with that state of Italian food here in the states. We were not only greeted by the owner Gino, but son Mimmo came out with each course and talked us through each dish. Even his nephew came by for a visit. It was that same hospitality and attention to detail that left me in complete awe in what I just experience. Gino came by as we sat and asked if he could do a prepared menu special for us with a different wine pairing for each dish. Without hesitation we both agreed and began our culinary journey through Italy. He left us by saying \"you know this is the best Italian restaurant in the world right?\" Now, as you may already know, I'm not a foodie...and I'm the furthest thing from a Sommelier. I know enough about wine to know reds go with beef and whites go with pork and seafood. Gino knew everything. He has a cellar filled with the best and top wines from the old country. Nothing comes into his restaurant without his approval. He's visited all the vineyards so who am I to question this. He's also certified to do so and has the sophisticated palate to provide these choice selections with the dishes his son pairs to go with. I would also like to add that all the seafood and meats in Mimmo's kitchen are 100% non-steroid/hormone, grass fed and Safe Harbor Certified Seafood guaranteed to be on you plate in less than 36 hours from being pulled from the ocean. It doesn't stop there because even the pasta, breads and dessert are all made in house, your choice, gluten free, and whole wheat. Impressive right? Incredible. The fact that I hadn't heard of this place until today left me feeling a little disappointed in myself. I left here with a new appreciation for Italian food. I've been to Italy; I've dined at the high-end Italian strip restaurants and Ferraro's made them all look stupid. This place gave me one of the best meals of my life (and I've had way to many good meals to count). It is truly a family affair. In fact, Olive Garden should be sued because when you're at ferraro's, you really are family and they will never steer you wrong.",

So since Ferraro's is off the strip we found it on yelp and decided to give it a try. We made reservations for 7pm. We arrived right on time and they did not have a table ready unless we wanted to sit outside, it was February and still quite chilly so we said we would wait. We finally got seated about fifteen minutes later.  They have a huge wine list, over hundreds of wines to choose from. The food menu is quite large as well. The service was just so, so. I don't know if we received poor service because we were younger compared to the crowed or because we were seated towards the back of the room but it wasn't good. We ordered an appetizer and it came out within minutes. Our entrees came out about three minutes later. We were then trying to juggle about five plates on a small table for two. I hate when restaurants rush the service. At the end of our meals were not even asked if we wanted dessert so we skipped out.   Overall, the food was good. The service was bad and we were rushed. Not the great experience we were looking for.",

We were a social 6 top who was there to eat and drink and have fun, which apparently fits right into their motto.  Our waiter Virgilio, was personable, attentive and had fun with us.  Just the right amount of making you feel special!  Drinks came right away (one minor complaint, the martini's were just a little ...eh...watery).  Carpaccio was perfection.  Frutti Misti as well.  We ordered (their last) 2 bottles of the 2004 Boroli Barolo, which the Sommelier delivered and decanted beautifully.  When it came time for a 3rd bottle, we wanted something similar - and he brought us the stunning Marziano Abbona - Pressenda (also 2004 Barolo).  Better than the first!  The meals were chosen based on our waiters recommendation.  I really hate it when you as a specific question and get a \"everything is delicious.\"  I want your real opinion and why!  The suggestions (Traditional Lasagna & Papparelle Mimmo) - shared by 3 of us, was perfect.  Only downfall was there was so much food, we didn't get to try more. Gino, the owner came by and chatted, shared some funny stories and made us feel like special guests.  Great meal, great atmosphere and most of all exceptional staff which without, makes even the most amazing food, diminish the experience.  We will be back.  Bravo Ferraro's!",

    "text": "When it comes to Italian, there's plenty of good options here in town! But for me personally, when I want Italian I go for the \"big three\", as I call it: Nora's Italian Cuisine on the west side of town, Ventano Italian Grill in Henderson, and this place if you want good Italian close to the Strip. A Las Vegas mainstay for 30+ years, Ferraro's is well known for being a truly classical Italian restaurant -- and it'a a favorite for many Vegas locals, myself included, for a reason! If you come here, ask for Zoran as your server -- he's attentive, funny and warm, all the attributes of an amazing server!  Whenever I come in, it's to take advantage of Ora Sociale, which is their version of happy hour. Unlike most places, where the food is hit or miss, their specials are among the most delicious items I've had for happy hour anywhere. Molto bene, as they say!  Typically I usually order a main menu item along with some various small plates from Ora Sociale as appetizers, but today there were so many intriguing items for Ora Sociale that I simply ordered from that menu only! Even before you order, you're given fresh bread with olive oil, balsamic and herbs that's always quick to go because it's that good.  To start, I got the arancini, burrata, the tonno, and the vitello tonnato. The arancini are light, crispy and cheesy, and come with an addicting truffle and Parmesan dipping sauce that I willingly eat by itself. The burrata is a light salad with pesto, almonds, carrots and creamy burrata cheese that melts in your mouth, so light and refreshing!  The tonno and the vitello tonnato were both surprising in a good way -- the tonno is a dish of yellowtail tuna tartare and eggplant scapece that both work wonderfully well together, and the vitello tonnato is a dish of roast veal with caper-tuna mousse, pepper toast and a light salad that is to die for. So good!  To round out my multi-course Italian experience, I got the margherita pizza and the rigatoni alla Norma. The margherita pizza was crisp, light and very cheesy, and the rigatoni was cooked perfectly al dente, the eggplant adding a richness to the dish that made it delectable ( and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't eat eggplant! ).  Of course, no meal is complete without dessert, and Ferraro's has a wide range of desserts to satisfy any sweet craving you might have! While Ferraro's has classic desserts like gelato and tiramisu, my personal favorite is the Cioccolatissimo, a chocolate and hazelnut cake served with hazelnut gelato and berries. Not too sweet, but still rich and indulgent, it's the perfect way to end a meal here.  Of course, this is just the Ora Sociale -- they have a wide variety of pasta, main dishes, and other appetizers that are just as mouthwatering, if not more so, than what they have on offer during happy hour! And with how late they're open -- until 3 AM -- you can come here and be guaranteed a delicious meal at any time of the night! But don't take my word for it -- why not come out here and experience Ferraro's for yourself?",

Well Jason most people won't take the time to write a review. They just won't come back. I use to love the food there and that is what we expected when we came back because we were in town. I have been eating Italian food for probably longer than u have been alive and as I explained, my dish was tough and tasteless. It's not about \"traditional Italian\" it's about lousy food at a high price. I also had your meatballs and they were nothing special. Again bland and tasteless. So if your \"okay\" with that then enjoy. I won't be back",

We chose Ferraro's after checking its reviews on Yelp and elsewhere, and because of its proximity to the Hard Rock Hotel, where we were staying for a Blues Festival. We were seated on time and our waiter was there immediately to ask if we wanted drinks. There was no rush at any time and we felt well taken care of. All of our questions regarding the extensive menu were handled with care and precision, recommendations were offered(but not pushed) and wine pairings suggested. We shared the most excellent burrata as an appetizer, the chopped salad(perfect) and we ordered the salmon, ravioli special and the lobster and scallop pappardelle. All three entrees were wonderful! The salmon was cooked medium rare and served with beans. The ravioli was in a butter/truffle sauce that was sublime, and the pappardelle was plentiful with what seemed like an entire lobster, three very large scallops and asparagus in a delicious broth. I am a hearty eater and I only got through half of the pappardelle. Desert consisted of an incredible tiramisu and a plate of cookies. We couldn't have asked for a better meal from the beginning to the end. In a city of lots of dining choices, Ferraro's is a great choice.",

The service was beyond phenomenal as well. Our server was attentive and able to answer any questions we had, and no ones drink glass was ever empty. They also had a full vegan MENU, not just like one or two options. I had the vegan ravioli and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice restaurant with incredible food and a cozy but sophisticated atmosphere.",

Pastas were al dente, just like in Italy...none of that mush or soggy American pastas. Taste on the palette was phenomenal. This place is legit and would DEFINITELY return.

Its family owned and you can honestly tell. its my second time going which i decided on after reading a newspaper article about the Mezzenote menu. 4 course tasting menu $25, speciality drinks are 25 percent off as well. This menu only takes place 11pm-2am in the bar only.   The tasting menu was just enough food for this time of night,  even though we were in the bar service was top notch and the food was really really exceptional. id go just for the garlic spaghetti. i went to Nove Italiano two nights before and Ferraros is so much better: easy to find parking, no casino to run through and no outrageous prices. went to Zuma earlier in the night and bar had seats open and hostess told us 15 min wait to be seated.  none of that silliness here. just seat yourself and enjoy the experience",

    "text": "It was over twenty years ago when I happened to mention to my tailor in New York that I was excited about an upcoming trip to Las Vegas. He immediately stopped the measurement process, ran behind the counter and emerged with a business card in hand. He handed it to me and said you have to go to my friends restaurant while you are there, It's the best Italian food in all of Las Vegas. So for twenty years, I've always meant to go to Ferraro's but just never made it. Maybe because it was off strip, maybe because their house specialty is Osso Buco, which I don't like, or maybe I just forgot. I probably wouldn't have made it this trip except for the fact that Ferraro's serves great food and drinks until 2:00 AM. After a long night at Bellagio's tables we realized we hadn't had dinner and we were sick of Cafe Bellagio's menu. After checking my VegasMate app, I realized that Ferraro's was open and the whole gang was more than willing to make the short trek over. Located across from the Hard Rock, it was a fast ride and I was sad I hadn't done this before. We were quickly greeted in a very friendly manner and seated. Service was fast and efficient. It was hard to believe you could get this high a quality of food at 1:00 AM. The Mimmo Salad named after owner Gino Ferraro's son, was simple and delicious. I could have had two of these salads with some tasty Italian bread alone. The stuffed tomato appetizer was a meal in itself, packed with a ton of spicy ground veal and drowned in fresh mozzarella. The pasta selection was recommended by the waiter as the best pasta in Las Vegas. He may be right. Outside of the spicy Rigatoni Vodka at Carbone this may be the tops. Ferraro's has a fantastic Italian wine list that's half the price of strip restaurants and the buttery Chardonnay that was suggested was a home run. This has now become our favorite late night option and we all agreed that a return visit is in order. Highly recommended.",

It's across the street from the Hard Rock (soon to be Virgin), plenty of free parking, and it is easy to get to without having to go down the Strip.

If you too want Italian food, and care more about the quality of the food than the celebrity name on the restaurant, this is absolutely the place for you. We had an amazing time, and the food was incredible.   We left most of our ordering up to our waiter, Zoltan, who is every bit as excellent as others mentioned. He was hilarious, and had no trouble giving us an unvarnished opinion. He never steered us wrong, from the wine, to our appetizers, to our entrees.  We started by sharing the Insalata Mimmo salad, with amazingly fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, red onion, and avocado in balsamic vinegar and oil. Added to that was the gnocco fritto, a puff of fried dough we stuffed with cheese, meat, arugula, and incredible onion jam and ate like a tiny sandwich. They were heaven.   For dinner my friend had the spaghetti aglio e olio and added sausage. She said it was incredible, and she ate all of it, so I'm sure she was telling the truth. I had the bucatini and nearly licked my plate clean. Actually, I almost did that all night, but we do have SOME class.  The entire night was enjoyable from beginning to end, and we couldn't believe two hours had passed when we finally checked the time. The portion sizes were excellent, and I left stuffed. I will definitely plan to go back the next time I'm in town.",

Its a deceivingly big and upscale spot, nestled between a gentleman's club and a tattoo shop in a strip mall. Don't be put off by the neighbors.... This place is the real deal.  We were whisked to our table in seconds, quickly honoring our reservation, even with a full house.  Our waiter, Eric, was fantastic. Charming, knowledgeable, friendly and as excited about telling us about the food as we were about eating it. It adds so much to the meal to have great service..... Kudos to Eric.  After picking some wine from the 2\" thick wine list (with Eric's guidance), warm bread is brought to the table, with a bowl of olive oil and spices for dipping.  A great start!  Next we shared a carpaccio appetizer. A full plate sized sliver of perfect lean raw beef, garnished with a mound of lightly oiled and seasoned greens is rolled tableside with freshly squeezed lemon juice. With Eric's commentary as he rolled the beef with flair and an experienced hand, the prep was as much fun as the food. This was an outstanding app - meat tender and fresh and the balance of acidity from the lemon with the crisp greens highlighting each bite.  I asked for and was easily accommodated an off menu entree. One of my favorite preparations is spaghetti aglio olio (garlic and oil), with shrimp. The prep here was spot-on.  The house made spaghetti was thin and cooked perfectly al dente, bathed lightly in olive oil with slivers of sauteed garlic. This, topped with 4 tail-on shrimp, broiled to pink perfection - crunchy but not rubbery. To say that I cleaned the plate is an understatement - I even mopped up the remaining garlic and oil with the last piece of bread!  My companion tried the veal piccata. This was 2 nice sized medallions of thinly pounded veal, lightly breaded and sauteed in a light, flavorful stock, butter and lemon sauce and garnished with capers. Another excellent rendition.  The tab for 2 with 3 glasses of wine was $135, very reasonable for an outstanding meal in a town filled with hi profile restaurants. I highly recommend Ferraros, you won't be disappointed.",

It happened 2.14.19 we celebrated Valentines Day we ordered  small menu with salmon and ceaser salad,  and   PASTA (PAPPARDELLE MIMMO - 43$) Salmon was really good But something was wrong with pasta it had a  little bit strange smell(but I didn't pay attention) we ate half and took home the rest of it, when we came back home me and my girl was vomiting whole night with this pasta, you have to agree it's not a best way to finish our romantic evening.  I hope you will respond on it because beside that it's a good place with amazing staff <a href=\"mailto:andreiwizard@icloud.com\">andreiwizard@icloud.com</a>",

I went with the pasta with short rib and mushroom and the house salad.  The mealbegan with some fresh bread, which was solid Italian bread with great accompanied oil.  The starter salad had fresh ingredients and flavorful dressing.  Very good portioned for a lunch as well.  The pasta dish was fantastic.  3 separate types of mushrooms were included and the rib had a ncie spice to it.  The pasta was outstanding and prepared perfectly.    No wonder Ferraro's has been a staple in Las Vegas for so long.  There's a nice outdoor seating area if the weather is nice, the wait staff is great.  The restaurant seems like an ideal choice for an affordable yet delicious business meal as well.  And they have nice lunch and Happy Hour deals until 7pm.  My only qualm at Ferraro's is that I wasn't able to do half and half for the lunch special (I had a tough time choosing between salmon and pasta).  I guess I'll just have to come back and try another special.  Great job Ferraro's.",

Besides that, the manager made me wear an ugly restaurant oversized shirt because I was wearing a shirt that had \"no sleeves\" like what the hell, it was a $400 designer shirt and I looked better than anyone in that place. I almost didn't eat there but I read this place had some good reviews and Believe me when I say that this restaurant will never be 5 stars on google or any resource for that matter, 2 fat thumbs down.

The food was pretty expensive and only average. Imagine Olive Garden at the double the price.  My spaghetti and meatballs were $28 I think and I didn't even want to finish it all.  The worst part was the VERY overpriced wine list.  I am an experienced wine drinker as I travel and collect wines.  The list was not very creative and most bottles I recognized had a 3x markup.  After carefully reviewing the wine list, I decided to order a beer as I have a hard time paying such marked up prices.  My buddy commented he will also not return.  I will say our server was very good though.",

Being italian and raised around good food, here and in Italy, I am very particular with my Italian food and for myself to recommend an Italian restaurant is extremely rare. A+",

Absolutely the BEST Italian food I have ever had, anywhere, including Milan, Venice, and Rome.....go figure.  My suggestion to you is a simple one.  Save a little extra money to have a really great meal here.  When you arrive at the restaurant, give the menus back and ask them to take care of you.  Gino and Walter were absolutely fantastic.  I'm already planning my next trip back to Vegas just to take my wife to Ferraros.  Yes, it was that good.  For those who are interested, our party had the Buca Amatrician, the home homemade sausage, Meatballs, rabbit, Ossobuco, truffles, a couple other things and two bottles of wine:  Batasiolo Barolo and an Arcanum.....Yes, I just read all that stuff directly off the receipt:)",

I do feel that the staff was pretty snooby and not at all welcoming. The server was American and didn't speak any Italian. (I think nice Italian places should have Italian staff that can pronounce the menu if they write it in Italian)  The food was good and authentic, but way over priced. I have ate at many places that have better and more authentic food in Vegas. You do pay for the \"wine bar\"atmosphere. Very nice place, elegant, but a little too snooty for my liking. Italians are some if the most welcoming people and I like to get an Italian atmosphere when I pay as much as I did. The food you can get better for less elsewhere! If it were not for the high bill it would have got a better review, but when you charge me much higher prices, I expect better taste and better service... neither was found here.",

Well, all I can say is Ferraro's was dynamite! Totally exceeded all of our expectations.  We wanted to sit outside next to the fire pit, so we had to wait a while in the bar - the bartenter was so helpful, and they had some very nice wines on tap, including a lovely Montepulciano.  Then we moved outside for dinner, and they continued to exceed our expectations!  We couldn't decide on a dish, so we went with a variety of the Italian \"tapas\" (probably 40 choices in all).  Had a wonderful arrancini with truffle cream sauce (so rich!), wonderful polpetti di nona, some very nice grilled vegetables with goat cheese, fritto misto (excellent and not at all greasy), and a grilled sausage (probably the low point in the meal).  Everything was wonderfully prepared and plated - not at all your typical American/Italian generic slop, and not what you expect from Vegas or a strip mall, but who'se complaining?  We'll defnitely go back, and so should you if you're in Vegas, baby!",

This was our 3rd visit and we plan on going back the next time we are in Vegas.  It is family owned and operated and it's obvious that they take great pride in the the food and customer service.  Our waiter was a handsome nephew from Calabria, who made sure our wine glasses were always full and was never away from the table too long.    My friend and I both started with the Insalata Mimmo...Heirloom Tomatoes, Avocado, Red Onions, Fresh Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Aged Balsamic Vinegar in a Radicchio leaf.  Absolutely delicious.  The guys had Cesar salads and said they were great.  I had the Gnocchi di Patate with Pomodoro sauce and freshly grated Parmesan and it was perfect!   Our friends had Lasagna and Pappardelle Mimmo...which consists of Lobster, Scallops, Asparagus, Butter, Sage and Seasonal Truffles.  They both said their entrees were outstanding.  But the real star of the table was my husband's Osso Bucco, the specialty of the house.  O.M.G.  My Gnocchi was delicious but I kind of kicked myself for not ordering the Osso Bucco.   I kept sneaking pieces from his plate, which I normally don't do but yes, it was that good.  Their wine prices are a bit inflated so we stuck to something inexpensive but with food that good, it really didn't matter.   And darn it, we were too full for desert :(  And I can't forget the live music a few feet away from our table.  We joked that their band consisted of guitar, saxophone, piano and defibrillator, LOL!  But they were quite good in a loungey sort of way and it only added to the dining experience.",

    "text": "First of all, Ferraro's is located in a strip mall next door to a smoke shop. Because it's so close to the strip, there isn't a strict dress code. I saw customers walk in dressed in everything from Mickey Mouse sweatshirts and denim shorts to cocktail party attire.  Ferraro's is almost dead around 5:30PM on a Saturday but that doesn't mean the service is any faster. In fact, the service was outrageously slow.  I'm not one of those people who walks into a restaurant like Ferraro's and expects to be in and out in 30 minutes, but I would've liked for my visit to be under 2 hours considering it was just my husband and me and 75% of our time here was spent searching and waiting for our server.  It took at least 15 minutes just to get menus even though when we first arrived there were only two tables seated (including us). Our server was extremely friendly but we spent most of our meal sitting around and waiting for him to come back. It seemed as though the busser did all the work! I'm pretty sure the server forgot to bring our entrees when they were ready because the busser ended up bringing it out and it was almost room-temperature with cold, slimy and thick sauce as if it had been sitting out for a while. (We both ordered pasta.)  Our server never came and checked on us to see how the food was or if we needed anything else. Completely not even exaggerating-- he didn't even glance at us from the time he took our order to the time he came and dropped off a dessert menu (literally 20-25 minutes AFTER we had clearly finished eating).  THE FOOD: The portions are very small compared to many other Italian restaurants in the area. The temperature of the food was completely unacceptable and I would've said something except (as I've already indicated) we couldn't get our server's attention unless we wanted to cause a scene.  I got the Gnocchi Zafferano and I usually love gnocchi but whatever I got tasted like the little dumplings in Campbell's Chicken & Dumplings soup. I asked my husband how his food was and he just shrugged and said, \"It's okay.\" I tried a bite of his pasta and had the same kind of shoulder-shrug feeling. The food wasn't bad, it was just boring.  All in all-- I hope our server was just a bad apple or having a rough night because he was awful. The food was less than decent-- not even worth half its price. I definitely wouldn't recommend going to Ferraro's.",

Our waiter even had an Italian accent and the wait staff in general was always prompt in serving us, clearing plates, refreshing beverages, etc. For the main course, I had the veal saltimbocca and my friend had the salmon. Both were wonderful. Even the bread was good (and I am not usually a bread person!). This is a place I would definitely visit again and will recommend to anyone in the mood for a great Italian meal. It is not cheap, but if it is a special night, or you have the budget for it, it is worth it. They also have a large, private room for parties and groups. We went on a Thursday night and it was packed. A reservation would be recommended.",

He was at our beck and call.  He was attentive to our needs, very knowledgeable of the Italian food lingo and he wheeled n' dealed us on the most prestigious dishes on the menu.  Not to mention his team of bus persons who hawked us for any breadcrumbs to be immediately scraped off the table.   Honest to say, I've been tired of the Italian food fare.  If it wasn't for a deal breaker I found on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaraunts.com&s=dab54d4b2dd9750db7515184b888303ab01b17aa93fcdbf12a8479df6a04a04f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaraunts.com</a>, I would have never considered dining at this stallion of a venue.  Needless to say, The menu items were more on the Bucket O' Gold side, but because of the quality and taste of the food, it was money well spent.  We ordered a number of items on the menu, but the one most memorable dish, out of all things, was the calamari!  The squid was fresh and fried to perfection!  If ya gotta PYT, take her here to start things off.. the ambiance is very dramatic.  If you're coming with a sizeable party, I suggest you order numerous items and have the chef portion the food to the number of people in your party.  The waiter will bring it in individual plates so that everyone gets a taste of  the Fanciness!  ..Fancy!",

    "text": "I have been going to Ferraro's for over 15 years. I love their central location across from the Hard Rock. It says a lot about the quality and service of a restaurant when it lasts that long, especially in Vegas, with all the competition. While dozens of other great local restaurants have folded in the past few years, Ferraro's continues to thrive and thrill because it consistently delivers.  Of course, this place isn't for everyone. If you prefer a mediocre menu, bland environment, and slashed prices, you won't be happy. On the other hand, if you appreciate high quality for a fair price, you will love it.   I always see the owner personally welcoming diners and making sure everyone enjoys the experience, because that's what Ferraro's is about: an experience made up of fabulous food (and I'm Italian, so I know good Italian food), a sexy interior,  huge wine selection, optional valet parking, and a beautiful patio that all contribute to a memorable time.  Enjoy the complimentary savory bread with olive oil, balsamic, and herbs, but save room - I highly recommend the house salad and the lobster risotto, which has huge pieces of lobster in it. Don't miss the tiramisu and cappuccino. And for heaven's sake, please plan to spend time to enjoy your meal; everyone who loves fine dining knows it shouldn't be rushed. The servers are prompt, courteous, and respectful. They know better than to pressure you, unlike the restaurants that keep it moving in order to make more money. If you're in a hurry, let your server know so you can be accommodated, but you will probably be happier if you plan your time accordingly.  I have been bringing friends and family there since 1997, and I can't remember any who didn't love it. Oh, and it's always a fun bonus to see the celebrities who dine there; they can go anywhere in town, but they keep going back to Ferraro's because it's the best.",

The food is still amazing.  My dad is a big fan of osso buco and he said this is one of the best.  I would definitely recommend the pasta I got, the Pappardelle Mimmo which is a seafood and truffle pappardelle.  We ordered a different ravioli this time and it was also delicious.  I would recommend the pasta here, even though the meat dishes are very good, the pasta is really where this place shines.  Oh and also there was a really beautiful soft mozzarella and prosciutto salad, but the menu changes seasonally so it may not be there when you go.  Also as a heads up, the building is in a strip mall and doesn't look like much from the outside.  But I promise it is so great you won't even notice that the next time you go.",

    "text": "I travel to Las Vegas frequently for business and always stay off the strip, preferably at the Embassy Siites just behind Ferraro's on Swenson.  I was in the mood for a light dinner and headed to the strip mall where Ferraro's is located.  I entered and was immediately floored by the prices.  They do realize they are in a filthy strip mall, sharing space with a Piercing Emporium and a shady looking massage parlor? I was by myself and, although there were tables in the dining room, the hostess clearly wanted me to sit in the bar, so I followed her there.  She asked me if I needed the wine list, but I did not; I then sat for SIX minutes, no menu, no drink, no food, no bread, nothing.  Doesn't sound like such a long time but when you are hungry, it seems like FOREVER.  Maybe they were hoping I would leave?? I eventually placed my order and a bread basket came.  My server was courteous but semed a little distracted, subtly implying that she had bigger and better tables to get to.  She was helpful with menu choices and I placed my order.  The bread basket arrived and fairly quickly my salad arrived.  I had a chopped salad which was a delicious blend of iceberg lettuce, black olives, Italian meats and a light oil and vinegar based dressing - very good!  Unfortunately, I stumbled on my next order, you see, several of the items (pasta, pizzetes, etc) had both Italian sausage and BEANS on them. My server explained that this was due to the chef's Tuscan influence. When I ordered the pizzete, she recommended the white pizza ( blend of garlic and cheeses) but I went with the Pizzete Toscani with the aforementioned sausage and beans.  Bad choice.  It was neither tasty nor appetizing.  Food 2/5, service 4/5, 3/5 stars overall.",

The Maitre D'  and staff at the door were very polite. We sat in their outdoor seating area which has shrubs on the fencing blocking passerbys from bothering you. Our waiter was, Apollo, who was very attentive and answered any questions we had about the menu. We had the Calamari appetizer, lightly breaded, and Pasta with Seafood. The pasta is made fresh there and the seafood is flown in everyday. They also have a wonderful wine cellar and extensive wine menu! They have live music (great vocalist/musician) which can also be heard outside via speaker system. The prices are moderate to expensive but worth the visit, especially for any special occasion. **One word of caution if sitting outside! The restaurant is just north of the airport and if their using the North/South runway it can get noisy. This isn't their fault so I'm still giving Ferraro's a much deserved excellent rating!**",

    "text": "I was in Vegas with my favorite Aunties and they had received a recommendation to \"absolutely try\" this restaurant. Let me back up for a moment so we can put this review into context: I JUST arrived home after a fun very \"Vegas-y\" trip to Vegas and despite how tired I am, I just HAD to write about my experience at Ferraro's. Yes. It was that good.  First, the restaurant is beautiful. It is large and open with dining rooms branching off from a gorgeous and inviting bar area (which is framed by their impressive wine vault!)  We started by having a cocktail in the bar where both the drinks and the service were fantastic.   We sat and started the somewhat painful process of narrowing down our menu selections to a handful of items. Everything both on the regular menu and the specials sounded great (they even managed to make tripe sound appetizing) but we settled on a burrata with proscuitto for a started and the buccatini and mushroom risotto for our \"secondi.\" The buratta some of the best I've ever had and all three of us finished our risotto and pasta as they were both so flavorful with layers upon layers of depth of flavor.   Main course was a seabass on the special menu and I fear I've run out of adjectives (be nice- I did just return from Vegas!) to describe how fantastic it was. Ethereal and perfectly cooked in texture with a light and flavorful white wine reduction.   I could wax poetic about their vast wine selection for hours. Some of the bottles they have- and reasonably priced, I might add - you'd be challenged to find anywhere else in Vegas or even the western U.S. ENORMOUS Italian wine collection and the owner and staff are available and well-versed in their offerings and can guide you to the perfect selection. The only thing I'd change, and this is such a small little gripe, I'd love to see more Argentine wines on the menu as I think they could fit with the food so nicely!  Yes, it's off the strip- TAKE A CAB! You will want to drink enough wine to challenge the legal limit without a doubt. It's worth the journey and I doubt there will ever be another trip to Vegas, no matter how short, where I won't make a point to eat here. The place is magical in a way so few restaurants can achieve.",

Ferraro's has been a fine Italian restaurant in Las Vegas since 1985 and it is obvious how and why they're still here 30 years later. The food was amazing!! We were a party of 4 and used 2 Yelp deals to get sampler appetizers. The chef whipped up a \"sampler\" of ravioli and a stroganoff. What?!? Appetizer?? Yes, for an appetizer and both were delicious. The risotto with black truffle was unbelievable. They also offered \"white\" truffle on any dish for an additional $50. Not cheap, I know. We did not indulge, but the fact that they offer it tells you how much this restaurant and its owner loves Italian food and loves making really good Italian food.   I will definitely come back to Ferraro's and try anything else on the menu.",

If we have listened to the one or two bad reviews we might have missed this truly wonderful dining experience. We walked in dressed very casually, with no reservation, and were seated within five minutes on a Saturday night. Waiter came to our table within one minute of us being seated his name was Michael and he was a wonderful waiter. The five of us each tried a different dish and everybody was extremely satisfied. From the spaghetti Bolognese to the meatballs to the rack of lamb to the Nonna's stuffed peppers everything was wonderful. Never had to look for the busboy to get my water refilled he was attentive without being obtrusive. I highly recommend this wonderful dining experience to anyone who truly loves excellent Italian food. I think maybe the bad reviews were people who work at competing restaurants and obviously their food does not compare. Also my husband said the  tiramisu was the best he's ever had.",

I had been here for happy hour before and had no complaints, so we thought we'd try dinner.  The service was very very bad. We were greeted by a grump and it all went downhill from there. We had to go to the bar to get our water glasses refilled - more than once. The waiter took our order, our desert order and brought the tab. Other than that, we never saw him. For our party of six, we were brought two spoons for the creme brulee desert, which we had informed our waiter we would be sharing. There was no inquiry as to whether any after dinner drinks were desired. We got up to find additional spoons on other tables.  Fine dining, this is not.  Now to the food. It was absolutely flavorless. And we had to get up to find salt and pepper in an attempt to make it edible.  The tomatoes in the Caprese salad were not even ripe. The \"Cesar\" salad dressing was blah. We actually all left food on our plates and that is a rarity for this group.  The two highlights were the grilled octopus appetizer and the pesto dipping oil for the bread. (We drizzled that stuff all over everything so we could eat it.)  On top of it all, tip was automatically entered and we were planning to leave only 5% for the bus help and servers benefit.  Avoid this place and go to Pasta Ristorante in Henderson instead.",

I was pretty upset to find that the menu on the website is not even a representation of the menu provided in the restaurant. The website says copyright 2012, but Ferraro's does NOT serve Eggplant Parmigiana as stated on their website, nor is their Chicken Parmigiana $20. It was $24.  Also, I've NEVER been to an ITALIAN restaurant that serves broccoli, carrots and POTATOES (potatoes!? seriously?!) with ANYTHING in marinara sauce. Especially since the menu both on the website and IN THE RESTAURANT says \"served with pasta.\"  NOT IMPRESSED. Still searching for a REAL ITALIAN restaurant outside of NY.",

The restaurant has a great wine selection, and absolutely everything on the menu looked amazing. My husband and I ordered and shared the seafood spaghetti plate and braised rabbit (farm raised). Of the two we enjoyed the spaghetti more. The rabbit is very mild, not at all gamey. It was a good dish, but I'd be more interested in trying something different next time. If you are looking for Italian food in Vegas, and are willing to pay about $50+ per person, I definitely recommend this place. (P.S. you might even see a celebrity or two having dinner here!)",

    "text": "This is MUST DINE spot in VEGAS. Off the strip (Across from the side of Hard Rock Hotel and Casino). Absolutely delicious Italian (REAL ITALIAN) and this positive endorsement comes from a New Yorker who knows of great Italian Food.   Yes the place is in a strip mall but DO NOT let that deter you. We didn't dine off the menu instead we had the chef prepare us a 4 course meal based on our discussion of food when he came to say hi at the table. I immediately said that I was in the mood for pasta, love risotto, love arugula, proscuitto, cheese and that I am an eater... little girl with a love for food.   First course was a sampler of risotto (best in my life ever) agnolotti pasta AMAZING, and a pesto risotto OMG incredible.   Second Course: arugula salad with sliced proscuitto and buffalla mozzerella that was a ball of heaven. Perfectly dressed with a hint of lemon. Incredible!!   Third Course: Oso Bucco which is what the restaurant is famous for. Literally falls off the bone and I'm not a huge fan of Osso Bucco but if you are don't leave this place without having some. It's cooked superbly. Chef also brought us linguini di mare with mussels, scallops, shrimp, octopus. Delicious. I was so full from the other courses that we had much to take home.   Over all the meal and service was outstanding!! Next time I want Italian in Vegas this is the spot of choice.",

Everyone was happy with the quality/taste of the food and the drinks, but unfortunately, the service was sub-par.  Our server seemed like he would rather be anywhere else than in that restaurant.  That is such a shame, when there are quite a few unemployed people who would be happy to take over for him.  AND, to top it off, we were there for HAPPY HOUR, where they advertise 25% off of all drinks during that time.  NOT ONE of us received our tabs with the discount on it, and we all had to give the checks back to the server so he could correct them.  PLEASE, he didn't seem like he was new at the job, so the only conclusion I could come to was that he was trying to rip us off intentionally.  The difference was a few dollars, but it's the principal. It's a shame a bad server will probably prevent me from ever going back.  He must have been the same server Staci G. had on 6/14.  Sorry I didn't get his name.",

So on the way back out, a sweet craving took over!! So ferraros was on the way and we decided to stop! The restaurant itself is stylish and old world in one, white linen table cloths candles on the table etc! We were greeted promptly by a very cordial hostess, and she offered to seat us in the bar area, and hand us the drink & dessert menu, there we sat for about 10 mins till someone finally greeted us, when he did he was super nice and apologized for the delay in service , I asked for help in my dessert choice and he said hands down the pastachio passion, my friends ordered the canoli and the cheesecake., each dessert was about 10$ a little pricey but definetly not the most expensive I have ever had, the canoli was rich and flavorful with crispy outer shell and a slightly sweet filling! Yummy! The cheesecake was stellar , rich and velvety and topped with fresh raspberries , now for mine! The pastachio passion was amazing !! A pastachio creme over a sweet cream cheese filling in a nutty/ buttery crust!! Each bite was heaven! I definetly will be back to try dinner!! Although not cheap! I'm sure of it is any way as great as their  homemade desserts I will be sure to enjoy !!",

They highlighted the wines of Santa Margherita and Chef Francesco exhibited his remarkable food paring skills.  The first course was fish, Chef prepared Salmerino Alphino--a wonderful Arctic char (a cross between salmon and trout, fresh cold water fish) in two methods. A sashimi style and a chopped with green apple bits. The dish was very fresh, light and very delicious.  Wine pared was a clean, dry Pinot Grigio 2015, which was excellent.    The next course was Insalata Di Granchio--a lemon and olive oil marinated lump crab salad, with a selection of delicate vegetables and flowers.  This was pared with a crisp and refreshing Fattoria Sardi Rosato 2015. The pasta course Parppardelle al Cinghiali--was a very hearty homemade wide noodles with a fabulous wild boar and vegetable ragu with pecorino cheese.  Very enjoyable and this was pared with Blue Label Chianti Classico DOCG 2012, almost a pinot style wine, this had the black cherries and spiciness but a great mildness to it.  The last course was Cervo in Crosta--hazelnut encrusted venison loin--done to perfection and very tender--with porcini mushrooms and a hearty rainbow chard.  This course was great and the wine pared was a hearty, complex Chianti Classico Riserva 2012.  The food was excellent and the wines were very enjoyable, another great time of learning about the Italian wines and food.  Thank you Ferrero's had a fabulous time. Look forward to the next Taste and Learn series in September.",

This was my first time going to this place, as I live in LA and was in town for a few hours for a business dinner.  My clients suggested this place as they have been frequenting the business for over a decade.  As you walk in, you will see the many awards and accolades that this place has received on the wall to your right.  (The stretch from basically the floor to the ceiling lol) and the place is just warm.  on the opposite side is a family portrait (as this is a family owed restaurant.)    As you walk to the host stand I was greeted by everyone from the host to the servers which was very inviting.  My clients had not shown up yet so i sat in the lobby and waited till they showed.    Once we were seated the waiter was amazing.  Had an accent but explained everything very well and suggested one of the 3 specials for the night.  I cannot pronounce or even remember the name for that matter of the dish however it was 8oz of lobster, w mushrooms, homemade fettucini with a white wine butter/garlic sauce..BEYOND WORDS.  Was heaven in my mouth.  During dinner Mimmo Ferraro came to the table (the son of Mr. Gino Ferraro) who was the Exec Chef? to check on everything.  Was a very nice touch of class. And then about 20 mins later Gino came to the table as well.  I love the personal touch of the service from the owners.  Tells alot about a business.  I did not order desert, however next time i probably will.  This place is definitely on the higher end price wise but worth every single penny.  Gentlemen if you are looking for a place to take your date, this would be a great place.  We had a pretty great dinner meeting, not to loud, great ambiance just overall this place gets a 10!!!  This is my new spot in Vegas for dinner.  Cannot wait to come back.    Thank you Ferraro's for a delightful dinner experience.",

REAL classy! The food was average, with the pasta being overcooked. There is a \"local\" discount on some entrees, but they added a service charge (even though it was only a party of 5) that didn't make the discount worthwhile. The wine list is extensive and expensive. A great place to go if you want to impress a date with your arcane knowledge of overpriced wines.

When our bill was presented she took the cert and when it was returned to us their was a 3.00 difference same with the locals promotion. She also had charged us for the most expensive glass of wine when we had the less expensive wine. We purchased two glasses at the bar at one price and were charged more at the table for the second glasses. This is the third time we have been treated this way by the same server. If they are going to offer specials they should honor them. We have dined and spent a lot there without discounts there was no reason to do this. We will not be back. Also the 18% gratuity that she added on the second bill was not necessary my daughter works in the industry so we always tip 20 to 25% so she lost out, wrong person to do this to. Never again",

Started out with an Italian app plate of cheeses and paper thin sliced meats. Delicious. The salads were unique and fantastic... from the arugula, fennel and fresh orange salad in balsamic to the more expected wedge. Half our party has steaks and half pasta and all were ecstatic about their selection. My homemade pasta dish (buccatini, pancetta, in a garlic tomato sauce) was outstanding. Steaks were prepared as expected. And the tiaramasui and gelatto were exceptional and authentic. A delicious meal... and with the half-off locals special, well priced too!",

We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night but were welcomed in to sit at the bar, where they serve the full menu. I can't really comment on the regular wait staff but our bartender/waiter, Christian, was good and attentive, even though I know he was busy. I loved the ambiance of the place and there was a good, live singer/piano player that was nice and not too loud. I had a delicious glass of wine from Montepulciano, after getting an honest opinion from the bartender to help me choose. We ordered a caesar salad (decent) and the caprese, which was incredible! Fresh, juicy tomatoes with a high quality mozzarella, olive oil, pine nuts and basil. But what I really have to rave about was the rigatoni with sausage and cannellini beans! Ingredients tasted so fresh and the dish was truly done to perfection. I normally wouldn't have ordered this but the bartender recommended it and I was so glad he did. We also had the spaghettini with shellfish and calamari in a tomato based sauce, which was also very delicious and LOADED with seafood! We topped all this off with the cannoli, which is not typically my favorite dessert but came recommended by a fellow regular patron at the bar and it was also amazing! I will seriously be salivating until the next time I get to eat here!",

    "text": "The whole experience at Ferraro's made me feel like a time traveler -- I felt like I was in the Vegas of the 1960's. Somewhat gaudy room, live band doing mediocre covers of pop hits, a magician (!) going table to table doing tricks, and a slightly hyper waiter who wildly exaggerated how wonderful everything was going to taste. I expected to see Dean Martin and Joey Bishop at the next table.  The food was . . . fine, but no better than that.. Fried calamari were an unremarkable rendition of the traditional appetizer, but a bright spot was the marinara sauce for dipping, which tasted fresh and with a good balance of fruit and acid. A buccatini with meat sauce was less interesting -- seemed a bit under-seasoned to me. Veal piccata was a pretty good rendition of that classic, but could have used a little less butter and little more lemon and caper flavor -- it lacked a certain zing. The pricing was very reasonable. Far from the worst Italian food you can find in L.V., but I've got to believe its far from the best as well.",

Inviting ambiance with live music playing at the bar with a fabulous Happy Hour. On my last visit, we ordered their Margherita pizza & it was simply delicious!! Tasty thin crust with a savory sauce & sweet basil. We accompanied our pizza with a Caesar salad & it was presented nicely and had a flavorful dressing. The Ferraro house salad is simply delicious which consists of arugula, fennel, grape tomatoes tossed in an olive oil balsamic vinaigrette topped with roasted pine nuts. We also had the calamari, but it could of used a couple more minutes in the frier to give it it's golden brown color hue to the breading. The calamari we received were a slightly on the pale golden color. The bartender was a bit rude in the beginning, but as the night progressed she ended up being nice. She did not like the fact that I found her Sangria a bit too sweet for me. Nothing personal but I am just not a fan of sweet alcoholic drinks. I will return. I do like this place.",

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The quality of the food was above average, seems they make there pasta in house. the tomato sauce was very tasty and fresh and the meatball was light and flavorful. Now the bad : in my opinion. First the portion size for the Happy Hour menu is very small. $8 for a burrata and tomato salad. Two small wedges probably 2 ounces served with 4 tomato slices. Next up spaghetti  and meats ballS on the menu it states the plural with the S in meatballs in reality you are serve a small portion of pasta which was undercooked ( being a foodie I know the texture of al dente and this was crunchy pasta with on golfball size meatball. The menu also states bread with a pesto type oil is $4 however is complimentary if you order other items with it. They charged us anyway and stated you must order off  the dinner menu to receive comp bread even though it is listed on the happy hour menu. The drinks for happy hour are 25% off however they are overpriced to start with. So my final note there is better value and quality for my hard earned cash, don't appreciate the bait and switch tactics.",

As soon as you walk in, you're welcomed back as if you were family.  This is True, too, even if it's your first time.  I don't speak Italian.  Nor do I try to pretend I know how to pick the best food or wine from the menu.  That's where Apollo came in handy.  One of the best servers I've had the honor to dine with, he made it his personal mission to help us find our favorite Italian cuisine and aged wine, direct from the motherland.

The menu selection was vast, the wine selection amazing.  Our waiter was Eric.  To start off ordered a bottle of wine.  Always a good way to begin a dinner.  Next was a Classic Caesar Salad for each of us.   My wife and I are retired, and have had many Caesar Salads over the years, and we both agreed this was the best salad we have ever had anywhere!!   Amazingly fresh and tasteful, and the presentation was superb!    For the main dish my wife had LASAGNA ALLA GINO...with house made pasta, Bolognese sauce, Bechamel sauce with ricota cheese and tomato sauce.   I had the RIGATONI CALABRESI....with house made rigatoni pasta, rapini, house made Calabrese sausage, Calabrese peppers, cannellini beans, olive oil, garlic  Both dishes were amazingly good.  Excellent from the first bite to the last!!  Eric was our waiter and we could not have been more pleased...for sure!   He did an OUTSTANDING from beginning to end.  He shared with us a lot about the history of the restaurant, and its owner, the menu items, and chatted a bit about our trip.  Excellent service though out our dining experience.  I learned that he is a golfer and lived in Portland, OR.  Which was a surprise since my wife and I worked in Portland for many many years (lived in Vancouver, WA)  He shared that he played gold at Camas Meadows GC  which is where I have played many times.  He was the best!!!  If you like great Italian food, good wine, and superb service, then this is a must place to visit.  Oh yeah, it is not in one of the casinos ....which is a plus for sure!",

The gnocchi at Ferraro's is easily the best I have ever had that was not homemade, simply because it tasted homemade.  The sorbet?  To die for.  Truly, every single meal was spectacular, from pasta to steak to sea food.  The salads were delicious and not too large of portions, the wine was exquisite, and service was great.  From the moment we walked in we were well taken care of, the servers were friendly and helpful, and good at their jobs.  The head guy even stopped by to say hey, which was pretty awesome.    The atmosphere of this place was equally amazing.  So much wine, a performer singing covers that were well done and popular (it could be a little quieter) and a good lighting.

The ambiance was perfect - the staff was seriously impressive with their service and knowledge. But the food, oh but the food. Keeping with Italian the dishes were simple yet so full of flavor. I started with the pasta fagioli soup - it was made with more of a chicken broth than tomato and the beans were cooked al dente with just the perfect amount of Parmesan to top it off. Although different sauce base than I was used to this light soup will become something I try at home. I couldn't decide between the Chicken Parmesan  or a specialty item a friend was ordering off menu so I lucked out and got my sister to split both with me so I could sample each. Let me tell you the off the menu dish was a pasta carbonara with Italian sausage and was probably one of my favorite dishes I have ever had. I love Italian sausage for all its flavor especially the fennel and spice. This dish enhanced the flavors in the sausage and allowed them to dance beautifully with the light sauce. I paired it with the Martin Ulisse Montepulciano Rose and the fruit of that wine paired beautifully with the spice. The Chicken Parmesan was very good as well and we paired that with the Martin Ulisse Montepulciano Signature Collection which was a nice bit of tannin to compliment the tomato sauce.  My only regret is that no one at the table got the salmon risotto that was a special of the day, I'm sure it would have been rich but based on their skill level I'm sure it would have been fantastic. We finished the meal with some shots of espresso and of course the Pistachio Ice Cream - OMG if you've ever had pistachio ice cream you know it doesn't always have a ton of flavors but this blew away anything I had sampled before. How they managed to get the pistachio to be the soft but sensational star of the show yet not over power the delicate ice cream is beyond me. It was delicious. I can't wait to go back again.",

The pasta was delectable, the braised rabbit was succulent though the polenta that accompanied it was more watery than it should have been.  The only reason we knocked a few stars off was the property did not honor their offer of a complimentary glass of wine that the server agreed to take off, and then when the bill was presented, I had to call the waiter back when I discovered we were being double charged for the glass of red wine that my girlfriend had ordered in addition to the Chardonay that was supposedly complementary with the entree.",

    "text": "Decided to check out this place last night since it was open late and I was dressed quite nicely so I wanted a dressier ambiance. Came in a little after 11p and it was their late night menu which was the full menu minus 5 items. Everything was full priced but you receive 25% off your entire check if you dine between 11p-2am. I came as a party of 2 and we sat at the bar. At that time there's only bar and lounge self seating available. The bartender was friendly and attentive but maybe that's because there were only 7 people at the bar and 2 in the lounge area at the time.   Fritto misto: I really enjoyed the breaded calamari and there were 2 pieces of shrimp along with 4 pieces of smelt fish. Being Asian, I liked the smelt fish thrown in there. It was different.   Spicy sausages: 2 small-medium sized sausages served on a bed of greens. Good flavor but a little on the pricey side just for 2 sausages.   Branzino: highly recommend this dish! Served over garbanzo beans I believe it was? And the skin on the small sea bass was crispy on one side and the meat was juicy and tender. It was easy to eat too. Bones were only found in the tail so I think they deboned most of it before cooking.   Seafood pappardelle: very seafoody.. The sauce had a tangy flavor that blended well with the lobster and scallop in there. The thinly sliced asparagus provided a good crunch to balance out the soft scallop and the noodles were al dente! Only downside was that the lobster was rather tough and not tender, probably because it's not fresh.   Overall, I'd recommend this place for an off the strip, local date night eatery.",

After 15 minutes of watching everyone walk by and never having anyone come up to the table to offer us anything. We were totally ignored, so we got up and told the manager about it and left. We went to Kaizen Sushi across the parking lot.  Very disappointed with Ferraro's.",

A couple  years ago my husband  and I  tried Ferraros and now we are hooked. It is my favorite  Italian restaurant  in Las Vegas. I just love that they make homemade pasta!!  I think the service is very good, the ambiance is romantic , great wine list, the price is reasonable for the whole experience  and the food is always excellent. I really like pesto  and their complimentary  pesto oil with bread is so good. I always get the caprese with pine nut appetizer and the stuffed veal pepper. They both are wonderful.  For the main course my husband  and  I  both get our own Pappardelle  Mimmo entree. It is incredible! Homemade Pappardelle pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus  in a butter truffle sage sauce. This dish melts in your mouth. Pure perfection! My husband doesn't like truffle so he gets it with the butter sage sauce without  truffle. I've tried other items before and they are amazing too.   We end this feast with tiramisu and cappuccino. I'm not usually a big fan of tiramisu but I like theirs. Overall I highly recommend this lovely restaurant!",

Our table was ready before we could order a drink but she was so sweet and had a great big smile on her face.  The Caprese is to DIE for, I highly recommend it. The bread is soft and delicious.  Being vegetarian, I was a little intimidated by the note at the bottom of the menu, asking customers to \"Please Not Alter Our Menu\"  However, when I told the waiter I was vegetarian, he offered up a modification of their Risotto, with mushrooms and artichoke and snow peas included. It was delicious, and the perfect match to the Riesling wine I had just ordered.  He was very polite, helpful and attentive.  Cute too ; )  The meal was a good price for a high-end Italian restaurant. I've had MUCH more expensive dinners here in Orange County, with comparable food but nowhere near as good of service as here at Mimmo's.  Very lovely.  Made for a very nice and romantic 21st birthday dinner.",

    "text": "I like Ferraro's. It's a classy joint that isn't pretentious, and serves upscale, but not ridiculous, italian food. To me, it's a hard combination to get right. When you go to a nice italian restaurant, you could very easily pay a lot of money for very basic plates, or, on the flip side, a *ton* of money for fancy bullshit California-italian-nouveau food. At Ferraro's, you can get a nice experience, atmosphere, and food that you'll never confuse for the Olive Garden or some chic LA pan-italian-fusion place.  Ambiance-wise, the place has low lighting, and can be very romantic, but can also work well enough for business or more casual meals. Service is usually excellent, and on most nights I've been there, Mimmo or Gino has been around saying \"Hi\" to people.  It's not particularly cheap, but it's not outlandishly expensive. If you avoid falling into a classical multi-course italian meal, your check will end up very reasonable. There are a lot of italian restaurants in Las Vegas where you can impress a girl, or overpay for a decent (at best) meal, but Ferraro's makes it possible to go to a nice place and get food on par with what you're paying.",

    "text": "I normally don't do this, but I was very excited about eating here based on all the wonderful reviews and people telling me how great it was. My opinion... HORRIBLE. We arrived at about 9:30 PM on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty. We got seated right away and drink order and menus were brought soon after. I must say for being a wine bar, there were no wine menus or suggestions or even asking if we wanted anything other than water from the person who took our order. We waited for over 15 minutes for a server to come take our order. Meanwhile we were filling ourselves with bread. Finally our server, on his way somewhere else said I'll be with you in 2 minutes. For the restaurant to be as empty as it was, this guy was running around as if he was slammed. He comes up, no introduction, no offerings, no welcome... NOTHING, all he said was you ready? My boyfriend said hello to him, and he just stood there as if we were taking his precious time away... gave him our order and he took off... running around like a chicken with no head. We felt very rushed by him. Finally our food came, which was ok not worth the price in my opinion. We made a comment to one of the bussers and he was apologetic but he just said that that's how the server was. For it being our valentine's day dinner it was very lackluster. Kinda ruined our night. The place is beautiful but just based on the service provided to us I would not recommend this place to anyone, and definitely not coming back.",

The first time I ordered the Gorgonzola salad (the exact name escapes me at the moment) which was like a dance of different favors in mouth -soft, buttery, sweet butter lettuce; Gorgonzola crumbles; balsamic and ranch; almond slices. The tangy-ness of the vinegar provided the perfect balance to the almonds. Great salad (got it again for lunch today )! Think of it as a wedge salad with butter lettuce. My dinner entree during first visit was the pappardelle mimmo. Pasta cooked well, large chunks of lobster meat throughout and big hunks of scallops. The truffles added a nice smoky richness. Awesome! I had the gnocchi bolognese for lunch today. Melt in your mouth goodness! Literally!  I liked the way the gnocchi stuck to the roof of my mouth. Meat sauce not too red and tomato-y, just the right balance of meat. Subtle, rich flavors! Everything was great! I have to knock a star because bread was not warm. Hard on the outside, moist on the inside but not warm at all! Service on point. Will return!",

So this time when one of my colleagues suggested we go there for their Osso Bucco, \"it's the best\" he claims, what kind of Italian would I be to turn that down? We were at the Hard Rock Hotel for a meeting and made our way across the street to a strip mall where this gem is located. It was lunchtime, late lunch, and we were hungry!  First I will say, the service was excellent. Courteous, efficient, and always with a smile. The atmosphere was just right, matched the quality of the entire experience. The menu and wine selections were well varied, not too much, not to little.  I had ordered the same glass of wine my friend did, and he came back with the wine he informed me that there was one glass left in the bottle they had on hand. He said it would be 10 minutes before they would have another bottle on hand and would l like another glass complimentary of something else while I wait? But of course! And it was more like 5 minutes until the other bottle arrived. You could not wipe the smile off my face. Similar thing for my friend who ordered a Martini, they poured him whatever extra was left in the shaker into a second glass and brought it to him. THAT is service!  Ok, now for the food... It was literally the best Osso Bucco I have ever tasted. It melts in your mouth, in fact I don't think words can describe it. We had commented that it had to take longer than 4 or 5 hours to prepare and cook this masterpiece (not while we were waiting of course, it's an ordeal to prepare this dish). Just as we were talking, the chef & owner Mimmo came out to check on us and he told us it was an 8 hour process. Thank god someone knows how to take their time and care for food as much as Mimmo! We showered him with compliments, our other 2 friends with us had the veal ravioli special and raved about it as well. Not a single person at our table had a complaint. We all swore it was the best.  How can this experience get any better you might ask? Well, when Mimmo sent out a complimentary dessert plate for each of us we about died! A small piece of the tastiest Tiramisu and a mini Cannoli took em back to memories of my Italian grandmother's skills. They were perfection.  If you are in Vegas, do yourself a favor and dine here. You will not regret it. It can be pricey, but it's well worth it. I think the places outside of the hotels & off the strip work harder to provide better food and service than the swanky places in the big hotels, and this place proves my theory right.   I will be back to work my way through their entire menu.  If you visit, tell Mimmo hi for me! Ciao!",

    "text": "I'm torn between giving Ferraro's a 3 or a 4... from a purely vegan value perspective, it's a little disappointing, considering that Italian food has many ways to be vegan without much modification.  Let me set the scene - nice ambiance, attentive service, zero vegan options.  Lots of vegetarian, but nothing vegan (with the possible exception of a salad.)  However, our server was on the ball and they rustled up some egg-free pasta in the back of the kitchen and left the ricotta off the linguine pomodoro.    I had the pasta ($19) and a glass of Sangiovese ($14), which made for about a $40 dinner with tax, tip, etc.  The pasta was pretty delicious I will say.  Definitely high quality tomatoes, olive oil.  Very simple but well executed.  But I felt like I didn't have $40 worth of dinner.    Bottom line - not worth it to me to pay that much for that little, but I would gladly go again if someone else were footing the bill or if I got in on the 1/2 off locals deal that Adina mentions below.    Everyone else in my party raved about their food, so if you eat eggs and cheese, you'll probably enjoy the food and feel like you're getting your money's worth.",

Our waiter is super friendly, yet very charming and knowledgeable. The water is always filled, the wine is excellently poured.  The food came pretty quick after we ordered, Osso bucco is yummy, the pollo parmigiana is amazing! The lasagna is good, and the tiramisu is quite a pleasure. The price is also not bad... . plus we have the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, which makes the pricing even better. (But talking the truth, we would be willing to dine here without the coupon). Oh... and I forget to mention the lovely live entertainment, am I? ... =) To sum up.. a VERY NICE treat to the happy stomach.",

    "text": "Ferraro's delivered $10 lunch coupon's to our office and so we decided to use them!  Anything on their menu will then be $10!  Wow!  We started with:  Fritto Misto $9 Fried calamari, shrimp, fennel, zucchini  - The calamari was delicious and the red sauce that comes with it is so yummy!  It was a huge plate... enough for 3 people to have a great appetizer!  For the main courses: I had:  Salmone Checca $14 Grilled salmon, fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh garlic and kalamata olives  - I feel like there should have been more kalamata olives for more flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing, but it didn't have alot of flavor.  I think if they added maybe some more salt & pepper it would have tasted even better.  I would order it again, because it was light and I think could have more flavor next time.  My friend had: Pollo Parmigiana $14 Chicken breast, mozzarella and tomato sauce served with a side of pasta  - He said it was good... but wasn't sold on it.  It looked really good!  We sat outside on a beautiful day and had excellent service!  They let us each use a $10 coupon for our main courses!  I can't believe it!  I would like to come back for dinner and wine next time!",

    "text": "I've never had the amazing opportunity to have a Valentine's date on February 14th.  Never, so you can imagine my excitement when I found out I had not 1, but FOUR other beautiful dates joining me this year on that special day.  Tonight, we decided to do it big, not only because it was Valentine's, but because this was my 200th Yelp review!!!  We wanted to check out a fine dining restaurant close to the strip so we stumbled upon Ferraro's.    The minute you pull up, you can tell you're going to be treated to a dramatic evening.  The outside is accented with stone and the low lighting shows a sneak peak of this intimate restaurant.  Red and white awnings add a little color and pizazz.  When you walk in, the first thing you'll notice is the very dramatic chandelier. The restaurant's red and yellow combinations offered a very passionate dining experience which made me realize this was an excellent choice for couples on Valentine's Day. The hostess stand included granite counter tops and etched glass.  I knew this wasn't my typical restaurant visit and that I needed to be prepared to throw some cash down that night!  One thing that did turn me off was the fact that we had reservations for 5:30pm and still had to wait for 15 minutes.  A party even got sat before us.  I didn't want to say anything because I didn't know the complete story, however, my perception made me a little irritated.  After the wait, we were sat in our own little room, close to the bathroom.  Our reservations were for 5 people, we got sat at a table for 8.  Kind of big, but I still appreciated having our own room.  Our server assistants were super nice.  My water glass was never empty and our table was constantly kept in an organized state.  Another thing that bothered me was the fact that our actual server didn't have much patience with our party.  It almost seemed as if he didn't think we belonged there.  I mean, he's probably right.  We love humble places, but let us enjoy it!  It's a special occasion!  One very impressive thing was their extensive wine list.  67 pages long!!  They also have an option to tour their wine cellar which I thought was super amazing.  Our party ordered two bottles that evening:  A Sauvignon Blanc and a Pinot Noir.  I don't exactly know what kind of Pinot we ordered, although I know it was from California and about $50 a bottle.  As for the Sauvignon Blanc, we ordered the Ferrari-Carano, Sonoma County '10 for $45 a bottle.  It was light and crisp.  Not sweet like a Riesling, which I LOVED!  Great choice.    Now onto dinner.  I decided to get the Risotto Funghi, Prosciutto e Porcini for $32.  As described on the menu, Italian vialone nano rice, porcini mushrooms, proscuitto.  No joke, THE BEST risotto I've had to date!  I love a great risotto and this dish did not disappoint.  Probably the most creamiest rice, huge pieces of porcini mushrooms and stems.  Add in the smokey flavor of crispy proscuitto and I was seriously in heaven.  I had to eat this slow, just to savor every bite.  That's how amazing it was. A good friend of mine had the chef's special, a Chilean Seabass with champagne sauce and black truffles for about $50.  There were other dishes ordered, however, those are the two that really stood out to me.  The food made me take a step back and realize how good life was.  Nothing better than food that makes you sit back and think of life's many wonderful things.  Super cheesy but it really made me feel that way!  Now I'm not a person who can afford this type of dining every night.  Every person on the table paid $75 each that night. Definitely somewhere you can visit on special occasions like Valentine's Day.  If you want to try an amazing Italian restaurant on a special night, please come by and check out Ferraro's.  The food alone makes you kiss your fingers and yell, \"delizioso!\"",

This would have been a 5-star rating, had it not been for the worst tiramisu I have ever had.  Dry, crunchy lady fingers covered in whip cream is NOT tiramisu.  I've had tiramisu all over the world, but this is the first time without so much as a hint of coffee or espresso.   Pitiful imitation!!  Ruined an otherwise excellent meal.",

It came as a recommendation from a fellow Denverite who knows his Italian food.  My wife, two children, and two business partners attended dinner here over the weekend.  I had the Agnolotti which I thought was pretty good.  My wife had the Spaghetti Polpette and kids had the white pizza.  Later I found out my wife found a strand of hair in her spaghetti but short of that everything was amazing.  The ambiance is that of an upscale Italian restaurant which was a surprise given the rough exterior.  Overall, I'm pleased and I'd recommend others try it out.",

We introduced ourselves and mentioned our anniversary to Gino and he immediately showed us to our table. This was our first visit and he proceeded to share their history & success of 32 years. Spend a couple minutes with Gino & you'll see why they are packed every night. He never sits, visiting every table, and engages the customers in conversation. He asked if we would be ok with him picking the dinner selections and we gladly agreed. After 4 courses of the most amazing food we have ever experienced he asked if we would like a tour of the kitchen. Before we walked into the kitchen he said we won't find a spec of food on the floor, \"you can eat off the floor.\" He was right. The wine cellar ranks in the top 3 in the U.S. for Italian wines, and has all the usual California wines as well. We left Ferraro's happy to have shared our anniversary experience with Gino and his amazing staff. Thanks Gino for a night we will never forget.",

    "text": "I give three stars not because it's bad food.  The food was excellent but not in the style of restaurant it used to be before they acquired this chef from Bellagio.  Gino Ferraro had a good family restaurant but now he has one for high rollers...more suited for the other side of Vegas and not expected in a mini mall that had smoke shops and nail salon.  Also too...it was suggested to get the appetizers for two and the price stated $22 which seemed reasonable but when the bill came out it was $44 and the dishes came out at $22 each which does not make sense even if it was organic.  It was an appetizer...not a meal.  We could have easily got just the burrata which was excellent...I would rather have gotten that then individual dishes that cost more than a meal!  Dinner was priced at each dish $22 and up.  Price wise for dinner cost more than alcohol...a complete no no in my book.  If you wish to make money by people who love Italian...you need to watch your price  list.  The owner Gino is a nice man from a nice family...he just doesn't want to cater to families anymore it seems...it's for high rollers and high clientele.  Too bad...we are not going back and not because we can't afford it...it's because there is better here in Vegas.",

After getting in & sitting at the bar the tender explains they \"canceled their happy hour\" for the week because of CES (an electronics convention). You're kidding me?!?! THAT IS UNHEARD OF & SUCH BAD BUSINESS... We got menus but were so irritated with their choice to \"cancel happy hour\", charging everyone (including locals) more money, we left.  We eat out A LOT & spend A LOT of money doing it, it's just our thing & I'm super disappointed by Ferraro's; just not sure I can forgive & go back to give it a try.  Btw- the place was dead too...sad.  P.S. Someone wrote me a nasty comment regarding this Yelp review..I could go on & on in regards to it but all I'll simply state is this: Yelp is for freedom to review one's personal experience and/or opinions of a business..This is exactly that- MY experience and I've worked in food/beverage writing and advertisement for years (hence 100+ great reviews); Vegas is a tough place to live, work, eat, and breath...my experience at this business on this particular evening let me down and I wished it didn't, simple as that.",

The staff is mainly Italian so they aren't overly friendly but that's nothing against them. Highly recommend the lobster risotto, and the ravioli.

We order wine and procceco off their amazing wine list. When that came we ordered the meat, cheese, and marinated mushrooms artichokes and olives. That was also amazing! We ordered the gnocchi for my wife and I ordered the sole. Bother were delicious. For dessert they brought a piece of tiramisu with a candle. And that was delicious too! Only issue I had was the price for the sole dish. 54$ !!!! For a the fish, 4  spears of asparagus and 5 small Luke warm potato chunks. I used the yelp offer but Virgilio said it is for the house wine not what we ordered. He was very nice and asked if we wanted Limoncello and of course we said yes! Overall was a good experience!",

    "text": "Bruh. How have I lived here for 5+ years and am JUST NOW trying this place? I have been driving by it for YEARS and thinking - we should really check this place out...but did I? No. I kept it on my list of \"places I need to go,\" but kept forgetting about it... Big. Mistake.  The b/f and I came here after a Knights game because we needed a post-win cocktail and something to eat other than T-Mobile Arena food. Here's how it went:  Show up, grab a seat in the bar. Meet Juan the bartender (spoiler alert - by the end of the night, I'm referring to Juan as our Spirit Guide and wishing I could take him to every restaurant in the future).   Juan suggests a wine for the b/f and a cocktail for me. I try both and for once in my life, close the drink menu because it's clear I'm not going to do a better job at picking things out than Juan will.  After some light chit chat (you know when the bartender engages JUST enough - but not so much that you need your space?), I ask for some recommendations on the menu because seriously people - EVERYTHING sounded incredible.   He started us out with the Bufala e Prosciutto. (Seriously, how does this man know my love affair with thinly sliced meats?) Guys - if you don't read anything else, read this - ORDER THAT DISH.   ...Actually - scratch that, if you don't read anything else, read THIS - let Juan do the ordering.  Everything we had was *muah* (I'm kissing my fingers and throwing them in the air, obviously). And keto people... grass fed, free range, no antibiotics animals, they don't mind substituting in veg for the carbs. I need an extra star for this.  Okay, there was ONE thing that wasn't great...The fact that I haven't been to Ferraro's sooner has caused me Great Depression and now I need to try and make it up by coming as often as possible.  Side notes: they have a private party room, a solid happy hour, and a ridiculous late night menu with half priced wine. Okurrrr!!!",

It is located in a strip mall across from the Hard Rock, but inside you feel like you are in any of the fine casinos.  Think more fine wine and scotch than Fireball and margaritas. The place is nicely decorated and is very calm for Vegas.  Staff was super attentive and served our large group very efficiently.  Our waiter and bus staff were all dressed in tuxes and quite formal, yet welcoming.  Food here is classic Italian so there may be some new dishes to you. There was a ton of tasty sounding pasta dishes that I have never heard of.  The house specialty is the Osso Bucco which was quite good.  It is a huge shank cooked so that it is fall apart tender.  The meat was a little fatty, but the taste was great.  The bone marrow was also a very nice treat.  The pasta was really good - they make it a point to tell you it is cooked al dente on the menu and when you order.  Appetizers were all very good especially the burrata.  This place gets a little pricey, but the portions are large and the quality is pretty good.  Check this place out if you want to get off the strip for some solid Italian cuisine.",

    "text": "Looking for AUTHENTIC Italian cuisine in Las Vegas?  Then you must go to Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar located in the Paradise Esplanade.  As for the authentic Southern Italian fare that can be found here, you won't find any mention of marinara sauce or garlic bread here as those are American-Italian classics.  Instead, look for pomodoro sauce and bruschetta.   Don't let its off-Strip location fool you into thinking it's a hole-in-the-wall establishment, either.  This classy family-run restaurant has been in business since 1985 and has won numerous culinary and dining awards.    I called earlier to confirm their dress code as we knew we'd be gambling before dining and was told that most residents and/or visitors show up in business casual or resort wear.   In fact, we were rather relieved to see more diners in resort wear.    We took a ride share from the last resort we played at and noticed a large parking lot shared by other businesses in the esplanade.  Ferraro's has designated parking stalls at its front entrance and valet service on the weekends.  We were met by a gregarious hostess and seated at our reserved table with dinner menus and an extensive wine list that was thick as an encyclopedia.  Our server, Juan G, was cordial and professional as he provided us with great descriptions of the specials and dishes.  His knowledge of ingredients of each dish that we inquired about was excellent.  He asked us if we had questions about the wine list and even offered to send over the sommelier, who hails from Torino.  I overheard him fluently speaking Italian to a neighboring table and swooned over the sounds of the Romance language.     We started with cocktails, a Negroni Up for me and Maker's Mark Old Fashioned for my dining pals.    APPETIZERS & PASTAS: -Special Cold Combination Appetizer Plates:   Minimum order 2 per table.  $22 pp.     =Burrata:  Apulia cheese, roasted spicy shaved carrots, almond-sorrel pesto.  The fresh soft and creamy burrata was accented with the roasted carrot strips and pesto.  I spread the cheese on the crusty bread that was served then added the carrots and pesto to create my own bruschetta.      =Octopus (Polipo):  marinated Mediterranean grilled octopus, potato, Kalamata olives, fried capers.  You can't go wrong with Ferraro's tender well-seasoned octopus.  The saltiness and contrasting textures of the olives  and fried capers were delightful.     =Carpaccio:  rolled thinly sliced sirloin, arugula, shaved Parmesan Reggiano, truffle oil.  Only the freshest raw beef sirloin was used to make these beef rolls.  The crisp arugula added a light crunch and spiciness that balanced the saltiness from the shaved Parmesan.    -Special Pasta Combination Plates:  Minimum order 2 per table.  $22pp     =Spaghetti Aglio Olio:  roasted garlic, extra virgin olive oil, Calabrian chili and Parmesan.   Simple and classic with only a slightly creamy 3-ingredient sauce (garlic, olive oil & chili) clinging onto al dente pasta.        =Gnocchi Pomodoro:  potato dumplings, Campari tomato sauce, basil, extra virgin olive oil.  The house made gnocchi were light, rich, tender and tasty dumplings.  IMHO, this was one of the Best gnocchi that I've tasted in the States and was most similar to those from the coast of Sorrento or northern Italy like Piedmont.  -Spaghetti Aglio Olio, full order for my husband. $22  DESSERT: -Pistachio Passion:  layered pistachio cream, cream cheese custard and whipped cream atop a walnut crust.  Get this!  The pistachio flavor was natural and this dessert was light as a cloud and not overly sweet.  Probably would have been enhanced with a glass of vin santo or espresso or maybe not. $12  The combination plates give us a taste of some of Ferraro's signature appetizers and pastas.  The portions were just right and no, we weren't going into a food coma nor leaving like we still needed to eat elsewhere.    Ferraro's Italian Restaurant is reasonably priced, authentic, tasty and classy.  We'll be back!",

Very convenient to find it from any direction. Plenty of parking to park your car or valet service is also available.  As a long time local, I dined in Ferraro's many, many times. I remember Gino and his family from their original location (Flamingo & Jones), and ever since, he is still such a sincere, loving, caring person. Truly loves his restaurant and the customers!   I am a type of person who looks at the menu and still ordering the same items all the time! My absolute favorite is the Osso Buco (Veal shank braised in red wine).It is the best in Las Vegas! Juicy, tender, very flavorful. Beautifully arranged on the plate with the side dish, farro. And the bone marrow! Oh my god, it's so delicious! I always ask for extra bread, so I can smear it them. Make sure you try it! The extra thin and long fork is provided, sticked in the middle of the bone, next to the rosemary garnish. Don't just send the bone back with a busboy! Enjoy it! My other favorite dinner item is the Pappardelle Mimmo (Long wide pasta with lobster, scallops, asparagus, butter, sage and truffle) Yummy!  Pastas are house made on premise. Whole-wheat and gluten free is available upon request for a $3 additional fee. Paleo pasta (almond flour, arrowroot, tapioca and eggs) is available for a$7 additional fee.  When I order salad, my favorite one is the Insalata Mimmo (Heirloom tomatoes, avocado, red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil with balsamic vinegar) ... So flavorful!  For dessert, I always order Tiramisu. The best you can have in Las Vegas.   For drinks, of course, it's your choice!  My favorite is red wine from Italy.  Paolo or Gino always happy to assist you with any questions about choosing the right wine with your dinner, either by glass or bottle.  I love this restaurant so much! I happily return with my family and friends any time!",

    "text": "This was my second time at Ferraro's and I came to try one of their four course menus they're offering this summer that feature cuisine from different areas of Italy.  I came for the Flavors of Sicily dinner.  The dinner consisted of four courses.  I chose:  Course 1--seared tuna with citrus fennel salad Course 2--twisted hollow pistachio flavored pasta with swordfish Course 3--korobuta pork chop with fava beans Course 4--soft sweet roll and lemon granita  The meal was very good but I made an error in choosing my pasta course.  I was interested in the pistachio flavored pasta that I didn't take into account the swordfish with it.  The pasta was very good with a very light pistachio flavor but the swordfish cubes just didn't work in the dish for me.  I should have ordered the other pasta dish.  The busiate alla trapanese was well done but I should have been less quick to jump at the pistachio pasta and avoided the swordfish.  The three other courses were very good and the $49 charge for the meal is quite reasonable.  My server was Virgilio and he was excellent!  He made sure that my iced tea was refilled and that everything was running smoothly with the dinner.  Ferraro's has been an institution in Las Vegas for many years and has an excellent, well deserved, reputation for serving fine Italian food.  I would have enjoyed the meal more if I had been more careful in ordering.",

I also had a salad of mozzarella, avocado, and tomatoes drizzles with a balsamic drizzle. The pasta is fresh and the ingredients perfect! They also have a seasonal four course menu highlighting a country. So creative! I can't wait to come back!",

If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask because I dined here 2 times and it was still great. I will definitely be coming back when in Vegas. It's great Italian food that I can't ever find anywhere else.   Food:  So I tried the rabbit and omg it was sooo good. The sauce that came with it was amazing. Tasted very rich after every bite. If you're hungry I would recommend this dish.   Also they have happy hour from 11pm to close and I chose the 4 course meal and that really fills you up as well.   The mussels were full of flavor, don't skip out on that delicious broth.  The spaghetti pasta with garlic was very new to me because the garlic tasted like actual meat. Very filling. The entree I chose was the salmon, and OMGsh that was some good fish!  By the time dessert came I couldn't even help myself to take another bite.   The venue is so pretty here. They have REAL roses at the tables so if you ever want to go on a date here, this would be the place. Sooo intimate & food just goes with the atmosphere around here.",

Fabulous staff.  During the previous summer, Ruben and I dined with one of our best friends, Randy. We were delighted to discover that they were offering locals 50% off the bill! Whoa right? So we took full advantage of it and did a full Italian dinner! ANTIPASTI: Calamari Fritti and Salsiccia Calabrese e Rapini (housemade spicy sausage grilled with polenta triangles). PASTA sampler course: Gnocchi with Boar Ragu, Lobster Truffle Ravioli, and Agnolotti (ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce). I SECONDI: Osso Bucco, Fettuccine Pomodoro Con Ricotta Fresca, and Agnolotti (Ruben liked it so much, he ordered it for his entree!). DESSERT: Pistachio Passion (layered pistachio cream, cream cheese custard & whipped cream atop a rich walnut crust) and Tiramisu. Everything was phenomenal. We all ordered drinks as well and the bill was around $150. Amazing.  Today, we visited for lunch and had to get the Calamari Fritti again. Very nice. Light breading, large, fresh prices of calamari, and delicious, spicy marinara. It definitely outshined the Calamari we had just two days ago! I opted for the Spaghetti Vongole e Pomodorini (housemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic & cherry tomatoes) and Ruben had the Penne Pesto e Pollo (penne with a light basil sauce topped with chicken breast). Both were really wonderful and the pasta was seriously good (also, cooked perfectly al dente)! I also don't remember the bread tasting so good last time! They were little baguettes with an oil dipping sauce and I couldn't get enough.  Great Italian food, decent prices, and wonderful experiences. Yes!",

Their food was a little pricey in my opinion and they have a smaller menu when you come in late night with 25% off your bill.   I ordered the pollo parmigiana. The pasta was cooked just right. Others at the table ordered fish. They enjoyed the fish but was disappointed there were only a couple pieces of vegetables alongside it. The presentation was nice but overall it was decent. I would probably go back to just have a glass of wine because of their massive selection, but probably not to eat. With their prices I think I would prefer to go to a steakhouse.

    "text": "Given the glowing reviews of other diners I was looking forward to trying this place but I found the food to be grossly overpriced and underwhelming in flavor and presentation.  I used the Yelp Check In coupon for a free appetizer.  Instead of being allowed to chose an appetizer from the menu the waiter brought us a small serve of spaghetti bolognese and one ravioli to share.  The food tasted bland.  I ordered the scallop dish which comprised of only 4 scallops for $29.00 with some crunchy bits of tiny chopped veges underneath.  The highlight of the meal was the salad, insalata mimmo, which was very flavorful but I didn't come here for salad!  Because the restaurant was less than half full on a holiday weekend the wait staff circled the table relentlessly like flies looking for crumbs.  They totally lacked a sense of acuity and were intrusive which took away from the dining experience.  By the way, the small parking lot was full but I was able to find a parking spot without too much trouble.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant when there are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from.",

They treated us as family as if they've known us for years and all of them were very pleasant!!  The staff is on top of any need you can think of before you can think of it.  Fresh grinder pepper and freshly grated Parmesan brought out and done by the staff.  The food - BEST gnocchi (all in-house made pasta) BEST cranberry sauce (I never had a cranberry sauce I've enjoyed before) and BEST Turkey I've ever had!!!! The recommended wine was also very well matched, and affordable, with our dinner thanks to the very knowledgeable staff!  We all thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and will definitely be back to visit on a regular night.",

    "text": "Just learned of \"yelp\" and have enjoyed reading reviews of my favorite businesses. We've been Las Vegas residents for decades...and Ferraro's is one of our very favorite restaurants in town.  The environment is both very elegant and welcoming...you can absolutely let your hair down and have a great time, while being certain that everyone who works there is a professional. I read with great interest the comment posted by \"Mike N\" on 11/22....it stands out as such an anomoly among the reviews of this restaurant....and it always makes my ears perks up when someone says he never writes a review, then proceeds  to write a really negative one!  Some people only speak up when they have something negative to say...and for people like that, almost everything they say IS negative.    I am very glad to see that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are commenting on both the outstanding service and food -- beause that's what Ferraro's has.  We've been enjoying this restaurant since its former location on the West side...it is one of our highlights in the city.  My husband and I eat at Ferraro's at least once a week...and I can assure you that Walter and Piero, as well as the GM, Adam, Mimmo, Gino, Jeff, Rick, Ali, and everyone else are 100% professionals. We have truly never had an experience there that wasn't amazing...and we've had lots of experiences!!!  The osso bucco, halibut, sea bass, filet, raviolo (just to name a few) are on our frequent flyer list...as well as many appetizers that I won't mention because I don't know the proper Italian spelling.  The osso bucco really is the very best I've ever had. Lobster diablo is another top 5....the list goes on and on. jThe extensive and reasonably priced wine list is also a plus.   For anyone looking for Italian in Las Vegas, give Ferraro's a try...you won't be sorry!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I were invited here for a birth day party on February 4th. When we went to wash our hands before eating, there was no hot water in the restrooms. The attendant informed me that he was instructed to run it for a half hour, as an attempt to get the water hot. After asking a server for a manager, I was pointed in the direction of the owner. When i leaned into his ear to whisper that it was pretty disgusting that he had no hot water (I whispered because I am in the industry I know how embarrassing that this can be)  he responded by yelling \"There is nothing fu***** disgusting about my restaurant\" so loud, I was stunned by his volume and tone as I was just trying to help. I responded by saying I just wanted to let you know I cant properly wash my hands. He then asked me if I wanted to re-wash my hands and i said yes that would be great. As he stormed past me I followed, thinking he was leading me to a different area where the water was hot. Unfortunately he goes into the same bathroom, and while two customers are using the facility and another washing his hands , he screams  at the bathroom attendant! Saying \"I WANT THIS FU***** WATER RAN, RUN THE FU***** WATER!\" and then stormed out of the restroom never to be seen again. Unfortunately  this did not heat up the water as he intended. We had hand sanitizer so we decided to go ahead with our meal because it smelled amazing in the establishment. When my wife's gnocchi and my fettuccine came out I was surprised to find mushrooms were a major component to my dish. The menu did not say,or maybe I could not understand the Italian, but I am allergic to mushrooms. My loving wife offered to switch entrees with me. The gnocchi was good, and she loved the fettuccine. Unfortunately later that night my wife became violently ill. I am awfully curious as to if any foul play involved, but I am honestly more curious as to if the kitchen had hot water for dishes... were we eating off of clean plates? Do the servers and back of house have a sink designated with hot water to wash their hands?",

Tired of getting ripped off we decided to try Ferraro's again ( we were at there location once before years ago and enjoyed it). As it was the first time the food was excellent & the service was impeccable. Our waiter Virgil was so professional and very personable, as him and I share the Love for the NY Yankees! My Husband had the Lobster Risotto which he said was amazing and I had the Shrimp dish which was amazing as well.   The whole experience was wonderful and we really enjoyed our night there.  We asked the hostess to call us a cab and with a few minutes one was there to pick us up.  The entire staff was wonderful and professional.  Just a shout out to the bathroom attendant she was a sweet lady and does a wonderful job at keeping the ladies room clean (don't forget to tip them)!! We will be back for another wonderful experience!!",

Joaquin was a consummate host - asking if we had any food allergies or food we didn't like - and then brought out an excellent sampling of 4 dishes to choose from. So difficult, as everything was prepared so well.  Reminds me of the fancier italian places we used to go to in NYC that had creative menus. The owner came out and thanked us for coming - asking if there was anything he could do. Other than make by stomach larger so that I could eat even more, there wasn't. A little pricey - but the service and quality of food highly justifies it. Looking forward to returning during my next Vegas trip.",

Every time friends are in town, we take them here and order that dish as an appetizer we share.  Without fail, some of our friends order it again for their meal because it is SO fabulous.

We got there a little early, and it wasnt too busy. A lot of big parties were gathering here that night. We were sitted at Piero's table. Piero is absolutely the man when it comes to service. There are some restaurants that should take note. He is what made the dinner so fabulous in addtion to the great food. He came out with some 'special' appetizers, recommended a fantastic wine, and even had a little something extra for my wife. It was a great evening. I still compare service, and qualitity of the italian food at Mimo's to italian restaurants here in Arizona. We were taken care of from start to finish. Unfortunatley my wife and I have yet to find a restaurant that compares here in Arizona for fine italian dining and service. I recommended this to my boss who was there on business recently, and also agreed this place is top notch.",

I'm so glad we did! We were seated in a round booth, perfectly situated for side-by-side people watching. Oh Vegas, you never cease to amaze slash repulse slash delight.  Our waiter was helpful and perfectly timed, not pushing, not making us wait. I had the Ruby Slipper (or a pair of them) to drink and let me tell you: that thing goes down smooth. I didn't even realize I was boozing until I was drunk. WOOPS. The bread and oil opener was delicious, though I would have liked a little more of the herb to balance the oil. We had a house salad to share as a starter and that was fabulous too, but small.  My date ordered the Half-chicken and said it was delicious; I had the filet because I am an asshole and a very expensive date. The filet was very nicely done; perfectly cooked and juicy with some of the balsamic glaze on the plate with mushrooms and peppers. I could eat that steak over and over. The vegetables were also delicious, but the potatoes were a little underwhelming. A different starch could be better.  I would definitely come back.",

Their red wine selection is more daring than the whites and the happy hour is great because the wines by the glass are half price.  I had the calamari appetizer which was awesome and I don't say that very often. Their cappuccino is also very good. I would definitely recommend this place for a date or date night. It sure beats the place that use to be there before it was Ferraros.",

I think my expectations were set high, as it was mostly forgettable in my mind. I only remember the Caprese to be very excellent, though. Through a variety dishes from risotto, steak, osso buco, etc it was not as flavorful and tender as I was expecting.  The experience on the whole was nice though, as I came here for a friend's birthday. I merely asked for dessert and the waiter gave a whole schpeal about how he's risking getting fired to give us a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday girl -- I'm not sure he was telling the truth or not, but I found it more annoying than flattering.  He also called out a roaming magician to perform tricks for our table. I guess is night, but I felt a little invasive.  Um, I guess it was alright.",

    "text": "If I could give Ferraro's 10 stars, I would. Everything from service to food to ambiance is excellent.  Came here for dinner two nights ago and got seated immediately in the bar area. Considering it was a Friday night, I didn't expect to get seated so quickly. The waiter quickly let us know that if we were locals, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on the menu was 50% off.   Carpaccio Torcello: Amazing! All the flavors melded so well together. The argula added a nice peppery bite, while the parmigiano added just enough saltiness to accentuate the beef...and the truffle oil....well, truffle oil just makes everything better!  Carpaccio di Tonno: Again, this was amazing! None of the ingredients in this dish over powered the other. They seem to only bring out the beautiful flavors in each other. A must try if you love ahi tuna.  Funghi Misti al Forno: Delicious! I'm not sure how the pizzas are cooked, but by the looks and taste of it, I would think it was brick oven baked. The edges were crispy, the mozzarella was perfectly melted and the mushrooms (not sure what kind of mushrooms they were) but they still had a nice bite to them (kind of like enoki mushrooms). PERFECTION!  Fettuccine Pomodoro: Fettucine with Fresh Tomato, Basil, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil topped with Fresh Ricotta. The noodles tastes as if they were made fresh. This dish has no meat whatsoever, but you definitely do not miss the meat with all the great ingredients and flavors going on in this dish. The ricotta was a great addition as it added a silky creaminess to the dish without being too heavy. Again, to me, this was PERFECTION!  Pinot Grigio - Veneto, Italy, '09 - Slightly sweet and the perfect pairing to the pizza and pasta  Pinot Noir - (not sure of the location or year) - delicious, warm aromatics and was a perfect pairing to the carpaccios.  Ruby Slipper Martini - delicious! There's definitely alcohol in this! Even though it tastes like fruit punch, it definitely creeped up on us a little later.  The service was great! The wait staff was very professional and were very attentive. I will definitely be returning!",

When we arrived, the manager gives the ladies a rose, really nice touch.  At the end of dinner they gave us a complimentary desert to share, and it was fabulous.  Every dish tastes individually made, with a sauce to die for.  The spaghetti sogleti (sko leo) is chuck full of calamari, lobster, clams, and shrimp.     But the best thing about this restaurant is the service.  Hands down the best service I've had in Las Vegas.    You can reserve a table online.  An extensive wine list!  Ambiance is fabulous.",

The service here was absolutely top-notch. We never had to ask for anything whatsoever. This place is class class class all the way. The ambiance was very soothing and romantic.   But the food was the True star of the show, and man did we go nuts. We got two appetizers - risotto balls and the caprese mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Both were absolutely delicious beyond all comprehension. The caprese - my god. The amount of cheese you get with this appetizer is mind-blowing. The only problem I had with the risotto balls was there wasn't enough, and it's not ideal for sharing because there are 5 of them - make it even! Six would have been ideal, especially for the regular price ($14 - ouch, but sooo worth it!). But I was a very good girlfriend and split the 5th one up evenly instead of devouring it myself ;D  We also split a house salad, which wow - this thing would have been enormous if I would have had it on my own. Heirloom tomatoes and the right amount of dressing made this dish delicious, and I'm glad I got my greens for the day!   Our entrees were also ridiculously huge and I'm amazed that I finished every last bite. I got the gnocci with vegetables, and there was an excellent ratio in my dish, about one veggie per gnocci. Very tasty but once I got toward the end of the dish I realized it was just a teensy bit on the salty side, but still very delicious. Matt ordered a ravioli dish that he enjoyed very much.   Even with all this food and being full beyond all reason, we couldn't pass up dessert - white chocolate raspberry creme brulee. The presentation was amazing and it was beyond delectable.   I am very happy we decided to change up our Dad's Grilled Cheese anniversary ritual for Ferraro's. From the setting, to the service, to the food, everything was absolute perfection. I will definitely be coming back again!",

He stopped and talked to us for a minute and said the food is always great at Ferraro's. He was right.  I got the salmon livornese and a cup of lobster bisque. Both were quite good. The price was reasonable for the quality. I definitely plan on returning!",

    "text": "I discovered Ferraro's by attending a Las Vegas Woman's Magazine networking event held there. They were serving these appetizers called Arancini Tartufo also known as a mouthful of heaven! Basically, they are risotto and cheese formed into balls, fried and served with a cheese dipping sauce.  Each person dining should have their own serving. That same night I ordered their Italian meas and cheese tray with olives and pepperoncinis. To die for! I wanted to go back but the opportunity never presented itself until months later when I received an email that Ferraro's was offering summer deals for locals. So I took them up on their $9.95 lunch special which included a salad and entree. I chose the house salad that was sprinkled with their house balsamic vinaigrette which was sweet and tangy at the same time and the Pollo Vesuvio with Rosemary Sauce. If I wasn't in a high class restaurant, I would have licked my plate. I instead opted for the olive rolls that were served with olive oil and herb dipping sauce to capture the remaining rosemary sauce on my plate. I was too full to partake of dessert. But I have a plan- upon my return, I will the skip lunch special and just do the same appetizer and then dessert. This place is so fantastic! You can tell it is run by a family who puts their heart and soul into every dish!. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting on? I'm pretty sure even in this economy you can afford $9.95 lunch special from 11a-4p until Sept 30 and they also have other specials for locals. Just ask your server.",

Our preference for a glass of wine rather than a bottle was what set her off into the foul waitress land of no return.  I have never seen anything like it!   After all we are indeed the customer.   You would think she would understand that her job is provide the best of service.   The customer is not there to make her night, and indulge her in what she wants.  I noticed her chatting with other tables and even smiling.  Not for us...Our food came out warm after a long wait.  She never came by to see how we were doing, or even offer another glass of wine.

The atmosphere is very classy and elegant without being stuffy. The food is delicious! I had the sweet potato gnocchi off of the vegan menu (love that they have vegan options). I also had a glass of Merlot after the bartender made a couple recommendations and had me taste a couple of their reds.   Definitely a great spot to escape the hustle of the casinos and have a more intimate, upscale experience. Prices are fairly high but not exorbitant, they fit with the overall atmosphere.",

    "text": "One of the few restaurants in Vegas that lived up to its hype. My boyfriend and I wanted to find a nice italian restaurant and came here for lunch. The interior decor is romantic and has a modern rustic italian vibe. We were immediately seated by the hostess and our server came to explain the menu to us. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.   CARPACCIO DI MANZO- thinly sliced prime sirloin, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano cheese, and truffle oil Our server recommended this appetizer and it was amazing! The meat was sliced so thinly and it was so fresh and I loved the earthiness of the arugula and the creaminess of the cheese. The truffle oil added a nice creamy and savory touch to the dish. The lemon was a nice addition to the meat as well because it provided a nice tangy acidity.   SPAGHETTI VONGOLE E POMODORINI- homemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic and cherry tomatoes This dish was very fresh. There were plenty of clams and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly. I only wished that there was more flavor. The olive oil didn't provide much flavor and I tasted a hint of garlic. The cherry tomatoes added a nice sweetness to the dish, but it wasn't enough to coat the whole dish.   SALMONE GRIGLIATO ALLA CHECCA Salmon grilled with Fresh Tomatoes, Basil, Fresh Garlic and Kalamata Olives This dish was very flavorful and saucy. I especially liked the home made sauce and the cherry tomatoes because it added an extra layer of acidity. The salmon was cooked nicely and tasted very buttery and tender. The rigatoni pasta was soft and flavorful.  TIRAMISU- classic italian dessert made with lady fingers, mascarpone cheese & espresso This dish came out beautifully and it tasted as great as it looked. It was creamy and moist and I especially liked the strong espresso flavor. The lady fingers were soft and soaked up all the flavor and the mascarpone cheese was so creamy.  i definitely want to come back here when I'm in town. They have such great service, the food is fantastic, and it's such a cute place to go to on a date.",

My husband ordered lasagna which he said was average and that he had much better many times. I can't even begin to describe my dinner. I ordered a pasta with a clam sauce. It had a green pasta that I think was a spinach pasta and very little clams. It was loaded with Lima beans. Imagine green pasta and green Lima beans!! The base sauce tasted like it was a chicken base which was totally odd for anything with clams. It was very expensive for a dish that seemed to be thought up by a child. I wish I had read some reviews on here first before we went there so I would have ordered something different. I also wish I took a picture of my dish to share on here!",

The meat was cooked to fall-off-the-bone tenderness and the shank bone had a nice heaping spoonful of creamy rich marrow. The bread-dipping rich tomato sauce that came with the entree was so good and I had to stop from eating the entire complimentary basket of bread.  Our waiter was from the south of Italy and I appreciated his patience as I was trying to practice my Italian speaking skills on him. He didn't try to rush us, and gave good suggestions.  Yelpers get a free glass of wine with their entree. I had the house Merlot and it was quite decent.",

As a side note Yelp check in allows a free glass of wine with entree, of course u can't combine HR discount so choose wisely lol. Cheers this review was 2 years ago.   We stopped again with Chicago friends March 2018 again a perfect score 5 stars we celebrated a birthday explored gluten free options.   March of 2019 we just stopped again with more Chicago friends celebrating 2 birthdays and did they put out again! 6 stars!  It was amazing as we dined out on the patio pretty much privately still within the bar area for the Happy hour deals. 3 amazing appetizers and 4 awesome entrees. Wine was flowing freely, the desserts were amazing.  Thank you Ferraro's for not letting us down!",

Since I was on a tight work budget and knowing I wanted the Osso Bucco, I skipped any appetizer or salad to allow enough room for one drink.

I did take a bite from two different breads with the olive/olive oil spread.  They were both excellent.  The Osso Bucco was a huge piece of lamb shank and it was cooked perfectly.  It was tender and loaded with flavor.  I savored each bite of it until it was gone and so was my drink and complimentary Merlot that I got from checking in on Yelp.  I have had Osso Bucco at other restaurants, but this was the largest piece of lamb ever.",

Didn't say no problem or you're welcome any time we said thank you.   2. Food was incredibly mediocre. I'm confused how this place got so many positive reviews. We had the:  tomato, avocado and mozzarella salad (3/5) - okay, I guess. How can you F this up?  gnocchi (2/5) -Trader Joe's sells a better version. Over cooked potato pillows with an odd tasting sauce.  garlic spaghetti (2/5) - pasta was very, very undercooked!! It was so hard. Definitely NOT al dente nor pleasant.  chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach (2.5/5) - the chicken was good but the spinach and mashed potatoes were awful. My husband left it on his plate.  veal picatta (3.5/5) - best option of the night and still, I've had much better in virtually every other Italian restaurant I've ever been to.  3. Their credit card machine wasn't working and they were handing people old-school carbon copy slips of your credit card # that they'd keep and run your card at a later time with. We did NOT feel comfortable doing this. So odd.   4. They didn't want to take my OpenTable Rewards in the amount of $10. I fought them and they eventually gave me $10 off but this got me mad. I earned my dining points fair and square and when I made my reservation, it specifically stated that I was using my Dining Poi. When I handed them my phone too (which had the rewards card info on it), the server took it and walked around with my phone for 10mins! He admitted he had no idea what to do with the thing.  If you're looking for good Italian food, and I mean GOOOOOD, go to Casa Di Amore. I just came back from Italy a few weeks ago and I can tell you Ferraro's is like Chef Boyarde compared to what we consumed in Rome. Sad experience!   06/23/19 - UPDATE after owner's response to my original review: I hope everyone has had the opportunity to read the response to a Yelp review that wasn't in his favor so you understand what kind of ownership runs this place.",

The restaurant was not very busy at all at this time so we were told to sit at any table we liked.   Starving at this point we started right away with the arancini (not pictured). They do bring bread with a pesto balsamic and oil dip, which I could eat all day it was so tasty. I also redeemed my free glass of wine with my yelp check in offer.   For our entrees we had tortellini filled with shredded beef. And the lobster risotto with black truffle shavings. Both dishes were very tasty and had amazing flavors. The risotto had too much bite, definitely had some bites that were crunchier than others but over all the flavors were good.   Stuffed at this point we opted to share a dessert, tiramisu. It was very light and moist. We were not disappointed.  Service was very good as well considering we were only one of very few tables seated.",

Water glass never empty and wine glass always full. They have a wonderful selections of wines.   The bread and the oil with seasoning is addicting. I love their lunch specials (salmon specifically). I have had the veal, lasagna, prime tenderloin, their house salad, surprised with different pastas from Walter, and of course tiramisu and cannoli. This family run place is still running authentically with family.   I will return and will recommend.",

And that's just why made this restaurant worth the visit, especially because of the Amazing Service their Bartender MANU offers. I know dessert and wine sounds weird for a midnight treat but not only did he recommend a Delicacy of a dessert but provided me with the perfect pairing of Wine. I'll be honest, I'll make sure to ask of MANU is working before I sneak another visit.   I had the Cheesecake with glazed Blackberries and Raspberries with a touch of Powdered sugar. Tiramisu and Pistachio Passion with a sweet and sparkling glass Pineto Brachetto D'Acqui, which pairs great with Desserts and has an Elegant aroma of Roses and Raspberries!!!",

Ferraro's is across the way from Hard Rock, peculiarly situated in a plaza consisting of a chain drugstore, hot dog joint, pizza stand, and a tattoo shop, to name a few. It's like playing a game of \"one of these things is not like the other. The answer is obvious... And no, it's not Shaq's chicken venture either.  Service was attentive, even for a holiday notoriously known for limited availability when lovers scramble to book their fancy reservations while looking wistfully into each other's eyes. That was us! Glad my bf picked this place.   Each lady was handed a single rose upon arrival. There was a special menu just for V-Day, but we opted to order from the regular offerings. I had the Yelp check-in free wine to start. Our waiter had to check if it was valid on a holiday first. My bf and I both picked white, but he only brought out one. We didn't want to hassle, but just saying.  Complimentary bread was soft. White tablecloths, with lighting to suit the mood. I had the RISOTTO ARAGOSTA, which is creamy rice with lobster, black truffle, and mascarpone cheese. Not gonna lie, it was probably the best thing I've eaten in awhile. My bf had the LASAGNA ALLA GINO, but he said my plate was better.  For dessert, I got the TIRAMISU. Honestly it tasted like every other tiramisu. He opted for the hazelnut gelato, which is made in-house. One of his scoops looked a little melted, but it was still good. Overall, we enjoyed our first dining experience here. Saluti!",

The wine list was truly something to behold. There were at least 50-75 full pages! We were a bit overwhelmed, so we asked our waiter to recommend/choose our wine for us! His selection was exactly what we described to him and they were spectacular choices.   I had an amazing pasta dish with lobster, calamari, huge buttery scallops and shrimp in a slightly spicy red sauce. The seafood was exceptional and the pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente!! Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish my meal, so they wrapped it up and I was able to enjoy it the next day!   The meal was finished off with a complimentary birthday dessert, for both of us, which was mouth watering. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone who will listen!!  Don't miss this jewel in Vegas.",

Our table was in the dining room which has 8 tables which is adjacent to the large dining room. This room is quiet and cozy. This is our favorite room for dinner. If you prefer to people watch, request one of the banquettes in the large dining room.  As in he past the food does not disappoint. Starting with the garden in a cup, Pasta E Fagioli. A wonderful starter with an abundance of vegetables and full of flavor. The Branzino, 2 large fillets grilled to perfection skin on. A tender flaky fish that melts in your mouth. It's served over artichokes and marinated tomato sopressata sauce.  Chicken Piccata, thin slices of juicy breast meat in a tasty sauce of lemon, butter and wine with capers along with grilled asparagus and potatoes.  Overall a delicious dinner for two that left no room for dessert.",

    "text": "I am sure our experience would have been extraordinary if we did not purchase the Groupon package involving this dinner. Even if we were not 10-15 minutes late (due to our limo driver), we were only given a little over one hour to try to relax and enjoy a 4-course pre-fixed meal.  Upon arrival, we were greeted with smiles and immediately taken to our table. Wine glasses were very well polished, table beautifully set. Our waiter, Eric, was phenomenal at menu knowledge, both food and wine. Thoroughly described the events of the pre-fixe \"Vegas Rockstar\" menu. Soon, our table was welcomed with bread baskets and a unique balsamic/olive oil house mix. Not long after, our first course of appetizers arrived (in which around this time we had told Eric our selection for entrees--since you pick of the options). Flavors were incredible; very bold herb notes in the potato dumplings. Mind you waters were constantly filled, even having our own bottle on the table at our disposal. The second course of apps was an arugula salad, and a very large one! My boyfriend and I did not want to indulge too much and be full for our entrees. However, when it came to receiving our entrees, it felt as though our order has just been placed rather than firing them from expo.  Already freaking out because we were on a limited time frame, my boyfriend and I watched the clock and finally came to the conclusion that we would not have time to eat entrees, as the package had us timed to return to the limo for our next event of the evening. My biggest complaint, would be how long it took for entrees to hit the table, especially when management/server are aware these packages 'give guests very little time to eat', as what one manager told my boyfriend as he went up to tell them we needed our food to-go. If we had to miss dessert, I wouldn't have minded as much since our bellies would be most likely full by then, but the main course?! It would have been thoughtful if at least the manager gave us a card, apologized, and invited us to dine again in the future or even a recovery service. Since we are local and have heard Ferraro's name associated countless times with the phrase, \"best value Italian fine dining restaurant in Vegas\", we would love to come back and actually be able to appreciate a complete, fine dining service.   When we finally arrived home, my boyfriend loved his filet. Tiramisu cake was delicious, holy cow! Only wish we could have enjoyed our meals fresh.",

I stumbled across this swanky Italian joint as there was a huge, yellow banner advertising their $9.95 lunch specials. I made a sharp right and decided to give it a shot.  I had heard about this place and had basically wrote it off because I have heard how expensive their dinner menu is (that holds True and I still wouldn't ever be able to come for dinner) but that's why I was delighted when I saw a lunch banner. You can choose from 3 different pasta selections that rotate daily as well as your choice of a cup of soup or salad for $9.95. I'm in!  Now did the food hold up to this Italian girl's high standards?  The answer is yes, yes, yes. I was given a bread basket to start with rolls nestled warmly in a blanket accompanied by a stained glass-like painting of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. These scrumptious little pillows held my anxious stomach at bay until my main dish arrived. Fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken....ahhh. There were ribbons of scratch-made noodles arranged perfectly on the plate with creamy, silky smooth alfredo sauce that would make even my Nona blush, all topped off with a fresh grilled rosemary chicken breast...it was Italy...home away from home, and within that moment, they had a customer for life.",

My husband and I were in town for a relaxing weekend after a week-long business trip that I had, and we wanted to eat at a non-casino place. So we googled \"best Italian food, Las Vegas\" and Ferraro's came up as #1 on a Best Of list. So we made reservations and gave it a try.  We have visited Italy several times and can honestly say that this is the best Italian food we've eaten outside of Italy. My mouth still waters just thinking about it!  The hostess was so friendly and nice when we arrived. We thought we might want to eat outside since they had misters, so she took us out there to get a feel for it and even with the misters it was way too hot. She didn't mind letting us decide, and happily brought us to an inside table.  Our sever was fun and hilarious. Friendly and attentive. I wish I could remember his name. We asked him to choose the wine for us to pair with our entrees (Fettucine Alfredo and lasagna) and the choices he made were perfect. We chose Fettucine Alfredo because their menu stated that they make their pasta fresh in-house and that is the best way to have Fettucine. It was PERFECT. Also, we love a homemade lasagne that is made fresh with a bolognese and bechamel sauce and again - SO GOOD. We also had the caprese salad (amazingly fresh and delicious) and even just the olive oil and balsamic they prepared with the bread at the table was over the top - with a scoop of fresh pesto in the center - OMG.   We just cannot say enough about this place. We will ALWAYS return when our travels take us to Las Vegas. The owner came to our table and asked how things were - and I don't know if we just gushed about our experience, or told him it was our anniversary recently, or just he is a very smart restauranteur, but he brought us a complimentary dessert sampler too! Do yourselves a favor and go here. Best taxi ride you will ever take.",

I'm glad that we did!  We first had a drink at the bar (25% off everything during happy hour from 4-7p), and then were seated in the beautiful, traditional dining room.  Our waiter was from Italy (I can't remember which part), and had a lovely accent and was attentive and charming the entire night.  We also found out that locals get 50% off the entire regular menu (specials not included), but we couldn't combine the coupon with the special.  Our waiter was gracious enough to calculate which would be the better value for us.  The food was delicious as well.  We started with the beef carpaccio and calamari. I LOVED the calamari- seasoned nicely, the breading wasn't too heavy, and I could have eaten it all night.  I ordered the lobster risotto for my entree and was very, very pleased. There was tons of lobster meat, and the risotto was creamy and well seasoned.  The creme brulee was a delicious ending to our meal, but the canolli was a bit disappointing. Nonetheless, it was a lovely dining experience and we will return.",

Staff was able to keep up with drinks and bringing food out in timely manner and to the right person. Everyone was eating at the same time which at most places doesn't happen.  I had the porcini rubbed ribeye 20oz and honestly I enjoyed it more than the steak I had at N9NE steak house at the palms. Amazing flavor great marbling!  Calamari was fresh and tender and well seasoned. Marinara was fresh with chunks of tomato. Also had a buffalo capresi salad and a small tasting app which was not on menu but had special ravioli lobster risotto and homemade sausage. All delish! Be prepared for high pricing even on pasta dishes. That's would be my only negative is the overall cost.  Def worth a trip off the strip and after dinner you can walk across the street to hard rock!",

    "text": "I've been coming to Ferraro's for years, well before we moved to Las Vegas.  We used to get into town and have dinner that first night at the old location on West Flamingo.  The veal osso bucco is the best version of this dish I've ever had, my favorite Italian dish in town, and my 2nd favorite dish overall in the Valley (narrowly losing to a mighty competitor, the reserve ribeye at Carnevino).  But, Ferraro's is so much more than its most famous dish.  They have had, on occasion, a lobster risotto that will make you forget your spouse's name.  We've ordered it more than once and it's worth twice what they charge.    The ambiance is very fancy, but the servers are fantastic and make you feel at home.  Wine list is long and can be high, but you can find some good Italian selections that won't force you to eat off the value menu for the rest of your trip.  It's well worth the short cab ride from whatever strip hotel you are staying at, and if you are a local, you MUST come during restaurant week.  The full portion osso bucco is offered for only $50, and it includes a starter and dessert.  It's been one of, if not the best bargain I have found during RW.",

    "text": "(Unpublished magazine piece I wrote.)  After a long day of sightseeing, sometimes, the last thing you want is another club sandwich or late night pancake special. There's those times when the only thing that can satisfy you is the taste of a home-cooked meal. When that craving hits, head to Ferraro's Italian Restaurant and Wine Bar, conveniently located across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.   A family-owned Las Vegas institution since 1985, Ferraro's features elegant yet hearty Italian fare. Owned by native Calabrian, Gino Ferraro, and run by his family and Tuscan-trained son, Mimmo, Ferraro's has a taste of Italy you can't get find anywhere else in Las Vegas.  Along with an extensive wine cellar, and Safe Harbor Certified seafood, Ferraro's boasts of house-made, fresh pasta, along with house-made bread and desserts. Also available are whole-wheat and gluten-free pasta.  With a lunch menu that features Salmon Pesto and Chicken Marinara for less than $10, as well as an assortment of salads, pizzas and Panini for less than $15 - their lunch specials are some of the best you can get for the money.  Ferraro's features two distinct happy hours - one at 4-7 p.m. which features a special menu and 25% off drinks. Ferraro's Late Night features 50% off the regular dinner menu from 11 p.m. - 2 a.m. For less than a show ticket, a late night feast for two, featuring an appetizer, entree and drinks awaits. The deal is incredible.   Highly suggested are the incredible Nonna's Stuffed Peppers, which are easily a meal in themselves, and the house-made Gnocchi Bolognese. If you're looking for something light, split the Affettati e Formaggi appetizer - a plate of selected imported Italian cold-cuts and cheeses. It goes great with champagne and the complementary house bread.",

Lets just say that not only was the service impeccable ( My server was Apolinar ) but every other employee there was on top of their game. From the bartender to the buss girl, every walk past the table we got a nice welcoming smile.  As for the food, I can probably say that the Calamari was one of the best, if not the best I've ever had, not a drop of oil on the dish after it was devoured. My entree was the amazing Pappardello Mimmo, a seafood pasta, it was outstanding.   Ill certainly be back.",

We were greeted by the owner who had a nicely tailored Italian suit on who was please the we decided to dine there on a whim and not having a reservations was not a problem. Very nice introduction and our waiter seemed right off the boat from Italy in a most charming way. Service was top notch and I had the olive oil butter pasta (which they are quite proud of) which is one of the best pastas I have ever had. I started with and excellent grilled Italian sausage. My friend had a nice looking 'deconstructed' Caesar that looked great complete with white anchovy (THANK YOU!), his gnocci was the best he had ever had. This was hands down the best meal I had in Las Vegas in the week I was there. I found this to be an excellent well run establishment that you would be hard pressed not to have an enjoyable meal. Turns out the place has a reputation of being the oldest Italian place in Vegas. This did not influence us going there but the service and food were worthy of praise.",

Wanted to be in Vegas for only an hour and stay out of the fray of the strip without losing the fun and a quick drive down the strip! This was the perfect stop!  First of all, the food is so good and very distinctive with unique ingredients like cucamelons. It's real Italian with hand made pasta and very fresh ingredients. I will not fully review the food, as it's already known for its stellar food, but the caprese salad, lasagna, butter lettuce salad and ravioli were some of the best we've had.  Posting this just in case there are people looking for that Vegas road trip stop without drama, just a little bit off strip (It's across the street from Hard Rock Hotel). At 4pm it was nearly empty and the staff was so attentive and friendly. There's a ton of easy parking. The waitress explained that they get busy in peak season (Jan., convention season) but off-season and before 7:30pm it's easy seating and quick service, without losing the fine dining quality you expect from a night out.  The prices are appropriate to the fresh handmade pasta, location, quality service and atmosphere: $100 for two people with tip.",

I had a tough time choosing between the Salmon and the Chicken and after talking with Nina, settled on the Salmon.  Definitely made the right choice.  Perfect portion, cooked perfect.

    "text": "So, my wife found out that they were going to be serving vitello tonnato for Mother's Day weekend. Since I've been searching for a place which offers it for the entire time I've lived in Vegas, I was happy to try it. I was so excited to go there last night.  First of all, our waiter, Virgilio, makes you feel like you're an old friend who came over to visit rather than a guest at a restaurant. You're instantly comfortable around him, and he's fun, he's engaging, and he's just a delight. He introduced us to Chef Mimmo, who is the one who decided to add my favorite food to their menu.   And OH MY GOD it was good. It was just like being back in Italy. Absolutely delicious. If you've never had vitello tonnato, it sounds disgusting - veal with tuna, mayo, capers, and lemon? Why would you eat that? But, if you HAVE had it, you know that, when done right, it's quite possibly the nicest thing you could do to your mouth. Chef Mimmo hit it spot on.   We also got the beef carpaccio as an appetizer. Delicious, heavy on the greens to give it a nice bitter taste. No disappointment there.   My wife got the ossobuco. I got to sample a tiny taste of it, and it was fantastic. I would have sampled more of it, but the expression on her face led me to believe that would not be good for my health. An angrily placed fork in the eye tends to sour an experience.   I had the fettuccine mare manzo. The mushrooms were amazing, the crab was cooked PERFECTLY. I would argue that the truffle oil was unnecessary in the dish, as there was already enough earthiness from the mushrooms. Other than that, though...  Lastly, we finished with the pistachio cream. Oh. My. God. It's just like my mother used to make. I didn't WANT to finish dessert, because I'm already fat enough, but a gun to my head wouldn't have gotten me to stop before I finished.   Absolutely, go here. Yes, it's spendy. But worth it.",

I love going out to fancy dinners and splurging every so often so I was super excited. Basically, the ambiance and food were awesome, but the service was so blah that I just couldn't enjoy the restaurant much.  We arrived right on time and were seated right away. Our server came over and my bf showed him the certificate, but he told us they had stopped taking them. We said we didn't know because <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> usually informs you if that happens with a certificate you've purchased. We were not rude or upset with the server at all and in fact were totally nice about it. After that little exchange, he basically treated us like we didn't exist. We had checked in on Yelp and saw that there was an appetizer offer for checking in and didn't even feel comfortable bringing it up as he had seemed so annoyed about the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate.  I think this sums up everything he said to us that night: \"Wine? (takes our order) Great.\" And then later, \"Ready to order? (takes order) Great.\" And once we were done with our meals, \"Dessert or are you done?\" To which we replied, \"we are super full, so ready for the check whenever.\" And that's it. When he dropped off the check after running our card, he didn't even say thank you for coming in or have a nice night or anything. Just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table.   Needless to say, I don't even need to go into details about the food, but I will say that one of my fave places is Gaetano's in Henderson, which has a swanky romantic ambiance and the food is even better AND the service is TOP NOTCH. You always feel welcome and greeted warmly by the owners, unlike Ferraro's.",

Arrive 25 minutes early for our reservation and are immediately seated. Place is very modern upscale Italian eatery with various rooms, nooks, crannies, side rooms etc that gives each type of patron from an intimate 2 top to a larger party options.    Quickly presented with the bottled water option, the wine list etc and two wonderful valued Sicilian wines are offered and IN VINTAGE.  Some garlic bread and rolls are presented with an Olive Oil garlic dipping sauce but the bread is Not hot and garlic bread simply cold.    Various specials are given and many lean hard on White Truffles which are an additional $80.00 to any entree BE CAREFUL HERE on this part. If you stick to the basic menu you will be very satisfied.   Appetizers in no particular order:  Shrimp Lemon butter Garlic two large shrimp in a delicate sauce were very fresh and extremely tasty.   Stuffed pepper \"nonna's\" with beef, veal, mozerella, and eggplant topped with an unassuming marinara sauce was very much top shelf.   Ceasar salad was very authentic with hearts of unbroken romaine lettuce with large slices of cheese covered with dressing heavy on anchovies and a hard boiled egg for esthetics.   The Real winner was the Meatballs which were absolutely outstanding.   Entrees:  No particular order  Veal marsala was two pieces of nice tender scalopini with a delicate sauce roasted potatoes and brocollini.  Thought the amount of veal was a little light for the price point but a 7 out of 10 taste wise.   Two Special Veal Osso Bucco one with \"Faro\" not quite sure what that is were absolutely fresh and outstanding, quality and taste wise. $45.00  The best thing on the table was the Grilled Veal chop hanging off the bone it was by far one of the best Chops I've ever tasted.  With some nice mushrooms it was clearly one of the finest dishes presented.   LOSER: My entree  Pasta Carbonara was almost cold as you can see the cream sauce congealing as it sat.  The peas were almost not cooked as the were hard like rocks and the overall taste of the dish was lacking in every facet on a 1-10 this one gets a 1 Really NOT AT ALL what was expected as they rave about home made pastas.  Skipping desert and coffee - it took some time to get the check and the appetizers came quickly while there was a significant delay in delivery of dinner entrees. Place was packed but still a little slow on delivery.   Also was told our Taxi was waiting outside and we go out and nobody has any idea what we are talking about.   All and all a definite repeat they need to tighten up a few things to get my 5 star rating.   NOTE LOCALS with Nevada ID can get on their local club which gives 25% off the ENTIRE CHECK... That alone with mostly wonderful food will get us back there.",

We supplemented the RW menu with Calamari Fritti ($15 / $7.50 for locals): Fried calamari and Spicy Tomato Sauce. This was good, very tender pieces of squid. Lightly breaded with not much flavor/seasoning...almost plain!  Wish these was a bit more zing/kick in the flavor dept.  The Complimentary bread...nothing crazy here, but the pesto/olive oil combo was nice.  I dipped the calamari in it to add flavor lol.  Tasting of Agnolotti : Ravioli Filled with Spinach, Mascarpone, Ricotta, Mortadella, and Tear-Drop Tomato Sauce. Good, but wish there was more to the tasting lol.  They gave up one ravioli, so it was a pretty light portion.  Tasting of Gnocchi Bolognese : House Made Potato Dumplings with Bologna Meat Sauce. This was perfect! The dumplings were super soft, tender and meat sauce was flavorful! This was the highlight of the night for me actually, and I would come back for this dish alone!  Gnocchi doesn't usually do too much for me, but this actually wow'd me!  Mista del Casa: Mixed Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was actually pretty good, coming from someone that doesn't enjoy eating salad lol. Simple but flavorful salad.  Caprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil. I only tasted the Mozzarella, which was good. Not my kind of dish.  For main entrees, Osso Buco ($45 or $22.50 for locals): The House Specialty, Veal Shank Braised in Red Wine Reduction and Faro. This was super tender, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth! Sauce was a good consistency, but a bit rich...couldn't finish it!  Tried the bone marrow...ok, but I guess I am not a huge marrow fan.  Pollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, a bit heavy on the capers with a strong mustard taste, but good overall.  And for dessert, a Tasting of Tiramisu and Cannoli. Tiramisu wasn't overly strong tasting, but good overall. Cannoli had a crisp shell and light filling...good!   Service was very friendly, and our waiter even entertained Little Foodie Dude while he ate :P  Prices would be great if you are local, and fair if you aren't...just not as much bang for your buck on certain dishes.  Go with the pasta since everything is made in house!  Give em a try :P  Pics :",

His service was perfect; never rushed, with a complete command of the menu and the wine list. We started out with the calamari, which I'm pretty sure wasn't on the dinner menu, but they made it up for us anyway, no questions asked. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir, and then came the food...  My wife ordered the lasagna, after much deliberation. She said that it was the best lasagna she'd ever had. I managed to get one fork-full away from her before it was gone and she was right--it was outstanding. I ordered the SPAGHETTINI SCOGLIO, which Gianni D said was his \"Friday night plate.\" I don't care if he lied to me or not, because it was amazing--filled with lobster, scallops, shrimp, with a sauce that had a little bit of a kick to it but wasn't too spicy.   There were two gentlemen singing/playing music next to the bar. I appreciate live music, so this was a welcome touch. The restaurant was hopping and a little noisy, but not to the point that I couldn't enjoy a conversation with my wife. You could tell that this is a place where the locals come to have an authentic Italian meal.   My wife and I left full and happy. We'll recommend Ferraro's (and Gianni D!) to anyone. Cheers!",

Once you walk in, you see all the accomplishments this restaurant has received throughout the years, and they have every right to boast it.   Paulo did a remarkable job explaining the menu. My girlfriend and I absolutely fell in love with his voice; sounded very authentic Italian with his accent and constant \"bene\" and so forth.  I had the osso bucco and my girlfriend had the gnocchi. I decided to try something ew with this and was delighted at what I chose. The veal shank was cooked to perfection and the gnocchi was excellent. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the crepe. All the food was spectacular. Couldn't help but wait for Paulo to come and grab our check and thank us for the remarkable dinner. I would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Excellent!  Love this place. My former \"go-to\" place was La Scala.  However if you want a special meal, try Ferraro's.  a. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.  b.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.  c.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.  d.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.  e.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu.   I love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great.",

This was actually a last minute reservation since our original reservation (Lawrys prime rib) had misbooked us and moved us to 9:30pm, which was too late so we opted for here instead. Even though we were seated quickly, the menus took a while to roll out. The server who helped us was super nice & friendly and helped us out greatly with the menu. I ordered a medium filet but it came out rare the first time so they re-cooked it. Food wasn't bad, but not to my liking (the sauce is heavy) but if you're the type to be able to enjoy heavy foods, give this place a try!",

As soon as the waiter realized we were looking for wine he immediately sent the sommelier. Well... Actually he was Mr. Ferraro. He denies he is the owner and gave credit to his wife. How cute is that? We told him what we were ordering for our meal as well as our price range and he brought the perfect wine for our meal. We shared everything so we could try more items and they were awesome and split everything for us. First course we had insalata mimmo. Endive with heirloom tomatoes,  luxurious mozzarella and avocado. Next we had the paparedelle mimmo which was house made pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter and sage. For real??? We also shared filetto di manzo... Beef tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. So tender!!! Sad to say we were too stuffed for dessert. Shh... Don't tell anyone!!!! However, so super impressed they brought us Ferraro wrapped chocolate to take home. Also have an amazing patio. Will definitely check that out when the heat simmers down!!!!",

It's only 50% off food and only certain items, not the specials.  No splitting checks.  They add a mandatory 18% gratuity.  No <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificates.  And no happy hour when opting for the 50% off deal.  The food is overpriced to begin with so 50% off just gets it down to a normal price.    I've been here a few times for events and it takes them forever to set up and seat us.  And the last time I came for lunch on a Friday, it was almost completely dead and they seemed kind of perturbed that I was even there.  It has been more crowded when I've been there for dinner.  Occasionally, I've seen a live piano player there, which is a nice touch.  But it did make the place very loud.  The Insalata Mimmo was quite good.  Not sure if it is $14 good, but still tasty.

    "text": "I entertained about 8 of my clients for drinks out on the patio last week and could not have been more disappointed. I find it completely offensive when one is paying $20+ for a cocktail specifically a Martini, and they give you a 5 cent pour. This was so bad that the liquid didn't even cover the second small olive at the base of the cocktail stick. This has nothing to do with ABC regulations. It's all about the greedy basters that run this hack of restaurant. I talked to the waiter and he could careless. So, I figured it would reflect in his tip. This bozo beats me to the punch and gives himself an 18% tip on top of the bill. Every drink including the club soda were all above $15+. This pizza hut actually thinks their history, food and drinks are the bomb. Before you walk in the door, please know that these clowns are there to shake you down for no less than $150.00 a plate. Do not, I repeat, do not, buy into their group appetizers. It's $24.00 a head, just for a pretty plate of nothing. Afterwards, I went to SW Steakhouse to get a man size martini. It was remarkable. They out poured Ferraro's 10 to 1 and was about $17.00 Lesson learned.",

It sounds like a great deal (and is for the quality you get) but after alcohol, tax and tip my credit card still took a beating.  Our party of four adults (and two kids) ate family-style, which was a great way to sample several dishes. The carpaccio ($14) was well seasoned and topped with arugula and shaved parmigiano. The star of the scallop dish ($16) was a delicious chiffonade of brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts. The two scallops lacked a good sear.  Following the two apps was a hearty gnocchi dish ($28) topped with plenty of slices of grilled chicken and heavily doused with pesto. The risotto aragosta e tartufo nero ($36) was rich and creamy, but the lobster was slightly overcooked.  The filet ($42) was as tender as expected and topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms, and onions and accompanied by potatoes, broccoli and carrots. The rib eye ($48) had a bold, beefy taste and was nicely charred.  They don't have a kid's menu, but willingly prepared grilled chicken breasts and buttered penne pasta for the two kids ($10 each)  The six dishes provided plenty of food for the adults, but we still managed to down two desserts. The tiramisu ($12) was beautifully presented -- a large square of creamy goodness that didn't have an overpowering taste of espresso. Finally, we had the white chocolate Montenegro creme brulee ($12). The best part of a creme brulee is cracking the caramelized sugar coating and this one didn't disappoint as the exterior yielded a delicious custard underneath. Although the white chocolate flavor was too subtle for my liking.  For a Sunday night the place was busy. The interior is upscale with it's white linens, dark wood accents and classic vibe. It's fit for a date night, power lunch, or just a fun night out with friends if you're looking for something that isn't too casual. It might be cheaper than other Italian restaurants on the Strip, but don't expect chain restaurant pricing. Quality food isn't cheap but this place is worth it, especially if you're a local dining on a Sunday.",

    "text": "We go to Las Vegas a couple of times a year and typically have our regular haunts we go to for dinner while in town but decided to try Ferraro's this time.  Our thoughts... Ambiance - Ferraro's is not in one of the casinos which is typically our preference and the overall ambiance was nice. A bit noisy but comparable to many other places. Food - A bit on the expensive side compared to the Italian restaurant we frequent.  Lasagna was good but not great.  My wife and step son had the \"half chicken\" and both had to be the smallest chickens we have ever seen.  We actually joked they were game hens.  They said the flavor was good but the portion size for the chicken and sides was very small.  Service - service was okay but a bit slow plus when we asked the waiter about items on the menu he said it was new and couldn't really impart much knowledge.  I had also said something to him about the chicken after it was served and he just chuckled and opted to do nothing about it.  Wine corkage - we had brought our own wine and hadn't thought to ask ahead of time about the corkage fee since they are typically around $20 or so.  Here it was $50 which is ridiculous plus their wine list was overpriced.  For some of the wines we knew it was 3x to 4x mark-up.  Once again, I expect 2x to 3x but this seems excessive.  Bottom line we won't be back.",

It's a nice, upscale restaurant. Nice and dim ambiance, great service. Unfortunately, we weren't impressed with the food. Some of us thought the food lacked flavor. Some commented, \"It's okay.\" Based on others' great reviews, our expectations were high. We were a bit disappointed.   I have to say great customer service from phone communications when I made the reservation and the restaurant following up with me. We also brought a bday cake, which they refrigerated for us during dinner. They brought it out with the candles I provided, had my son blow the candles, then brought the cake back and came out with plated slices for everyone. This was all done without an added fee. We've been to other restaurants where they charge you a high cake fee, which I think is quite ridiculous. Our servers were all very friendly and attentive. Most restaurants have you select from a very limited menu made for large groups. We didn't have to. They only do that for private events. I really appreciate that.   All in all, I'd say we had a good experience. I'd probably come back and try out other entrees.",

She was very professional and helpful. I was a little nervous since I had never actually been there but Natasha and Yelp came through. Everything went exactly as planned. The service was attentive but not disruptive. The food was awesome. All our guests had a great time and commented positively on the whole experience.   We were in a separate room but still open to the restaurant which was much better than being shut up in a private room.   It was a lovely and memorable evening!",

Eric, our waiter, was not only understanding of my dietary needs, he went above and beyond to recommend a paleo pasta bolognese that he thought I'd enjoy. He was right!  It was TERRIFIC!  It was not just great for paleo, but I'd put it up against any pasta dish, paleo or not. My daughter had the lasagna and she said it was the best restaurant lasagna she'd ever had.  Eric's attentiveness was most appreciated and the staff made sure our water glasses were never empty.  While this restaurant is on the spendy side, I would definitely say that it's worth EVERY penny and when we'll definitely be visiting again the next time we're in Vegas.",

That makes its so Convenient to just walk . It must have been around 1:00am by the time we sat down in the restaurant . Our waiter was amazing . He was very knowledgable about the history of the restaurant . He helped us pick a wine from the \"wine bible \" which was pages long. The food was incredible! And the best part of it all was their special late night discount of 50% off the entire menu. It's a must visit while in Vegas",

My Jack & Coke was mostly Jack with a splash of Coke. My wife's Snickerdoodle (pinky drink) tasted like the real thing. It should've been a dessert drink.  The bread basket was warm and we began with an appitizer sampler: 1) lobster ravioli with asparagus was my favorite thing I ate here. Luckily, the Mrs. doesn't eat seafood so I got hers, too. 2) Mushroom risoto was cooked al dente. Very good. 3) Sausage had spice. Very good. Then I got the scallop appetizer. It was perfectly seared and seasoned. I could've ended the meal there, but my main dish was brought out: Osso Bucco (The house specialty) $43.  I was a bit disappointed here. The meat was fall off the bone tender and beefy. It was the tomato based sauce that just didn't seem to go well with the meat. I like my braised meats with garlic & rosemary, so I ate the rosemary garnish with it. I did eat the bone marrow on the bread. That was extremely rich. The barley side was kinda bland, but a plenty. I tried my wife's filet. It was kinda tough and dry. Nothing special.  The tiramisu was perfection, but it was way too small. I make mine from scratch, so I'm used to giving myself bigger slices. This was about half the size of a deck of cards. I recently read that the owner comes in everyday and personally makes the Tiramisu though.   Limoncello was STRONG. I could only take a few sips and gave it to others who could handle it.  Overall, I did enjoy it because it was FREE!",

Las Vegas has an over abundance of tourist trap restaurants along the strip that cater to the unsophisticated masses. Why not venture out to a quiet off the strip restaurant that is worth every penny!  Key Reasons to go -  Romantic and cozy ambience Out of the hustle and bustle Private lot to park in Nice bar area Welcoming hosts and waitstaff Decent wine selection Friendly and attentive service Modern & clean restrooms Delicious food  The highlight of the night and the reason to return, is Ferraro's fall of the bone and melt in your mouth Osso Buco. They compliment it with the creamiest most delish risotto on the side. To die for!!!!!!! After a yummy salad there is hardly any room for desert unless you take it to go.    My husband tried the house lasagna. Now let me preface this by telling you that ALL lasagna dishes at restaurants have stiff competition to overcome. My mother-in-law's amazing sauce takes 2 days to make. When you combine that with real fall off the bone meat and layers of various cheeses and fresh pasta you have the most incredible flavor sensations in every bite.  Honestly, it's hard for restaurants to even compete.  Having said all that it was decent lasagna, but I think he was jealous of my Osso Buco and it was just too good to share more than a bite or two! he he he  We most def will be back the next time we are in Vegas and craving some authentic Italian food.",

And we were looking for a great Italian experience in Vegas, and after checking out pricing, menus and reviews, we went for Ferraro's even though we'd been to the same area for nearly every other meal.....but the Strip restaurants were either chains or way overpriced and not much authenticity in the menu.  Restaurant is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  Host staff were extremely friendly, and made us feel special from the moment we walked in.  Our waiter, Eric, was super nice, very knowledgeable and creative with menu recommendations.  He helped us with great wine choices, and even offered to give me samplers of two dishes I couldn't decide between.  Really was an enjoyable evening, and we enjoyed knowing that we were supporting a local Vegas family-owned operation.  It was definitely worth a special occasion meal, but also friendly enough for two friends to just enjoy an evening together and not feel out of place.",

The calamari was in line with the best I've had at other places, couple that with good bread, salad and amazing ossu bucco and you have to give this place a try.   Yes, it is not on the strip, but is is located across from the Hard Rock Hotel. This has it's advantages as you are not paying for location as you are on the strip. The prices were very fair for the quality of food, especially in Las Vegas, NV. The service was top notch as we never had to wait for a refill or have dirty plates in front of you.   This place gets busy, so make a reservation. We had one on a Saturday night and still had to wait about 15 minutes, but we got a drink in the bar and had no complaints.

The service was crap, the \"fresh made pasta\" was way under cooked (hows that possible?) and I am familiar with \"al dente\"....but crunchy spaghetti??? C'mon.  We ordered the \"exotic\" cheeseplate to start....LOL, the ding dong waitress had no idea what the cheeses were so we were left guessing.....although it was a fun game, not even 3 star service.  She suggested provolone was an exotic cheese. Precious.  Ordered sparking water and the waiter kept filling my glass with tap;( and then bringing me a new glass each time. The lobster ravioli wasnt bad, but nothing special. My friend had spaghetti and meatballs and it was BAD. How does an Italian restaurant screw up spaghetti and meatballs???? The noodles were crunchy and the sauce was like canned tomato sauce heated in the micro and the meatballs smelled like canned dogfood. As we left, an older gentleman( owner? Manager?)  asked if everything was \"ok\" and I said \" it was ok\" and he was offended and questioned in his hammed up Italian accent \"where we'd had better food?\"  I told him \" I make better spaghetti and I'm Irish\" he didnt think it was funny and asked no more questions;) Do not eat at Ferraros....go to Olive Garden or Mac. Grill and save yourself $100 or pick any other Italian place in Vegas, great odds that its better.",

I was a little bummed because I made a note online that we were celebrating my husbands birthday and I guess they didn't see that either so nothing was done. The restaurant itself is pretty, and the live music is a nice touch. The service was also pretty good, but the food was only so-so. My husband had the filet and he said it didn't have much flavor. He said the same about the roasted potatoes it was served with. I had the seafood pappardelle. There was a good amount of lobster and scallops but my lobster was over cooked and the pasta was a bit chewy. The sauce and scallops were good but again, nothing spectacular. We also had 2 cocktails that were very sweet. It wasn't a horrible experience but it also wasn't memorable. I'd much rather go to Del Frisco's for steak or Giada's for Italian.",

    "text": "The new location is swanky but in a kind of \"I have to order a glass of red wine\" way. Do you know what I mean? It is just a little stuffy, but this environment definitely serves a purpose. For example, this is a perfect restaurant for your parents from out of town or for a first date, especially a blind date, or for some men in suits. There is nothing offensive, edgy or loud about the experience.   They actually have happy hour specials on drinks, but we arrived past 7pm--too late for deals. The cheapest glass by the wine is around $12, but they also serve wines in \"tasting\" volumes, i.e. one ounce and five ounces.    My buddy and I sat in the bar area, which I like. The high-top tables are comfortable, and there is entertainment. They actually have a stage, and when we were there, there was a pianist singing some standard piano songs. I am not a fan of this live music genre, but it does enliven the atmosphere. I think on Friday and Saturday nights they are going to start having a DJ, which could be worth catching. They even have a special late night \"tapas\" menu from 10pm-2am.   I must say given the current state of breadbaskets, the goods here were above average. The bread was warm, fresh and served with some lovely oil, vinegar and pesto. I had the fettuccine pomodoro with ricotta. The pasta is fresh, and I really enjoyed the texture and thickness. The noodles themselves were well executed, and the flavors were unfussy, but delicious.   I am probably in a minority, but I have a hard time spending $19 on a pasta dish, especially when there is no meat. Thus, I am torn. I think the food is tasty. The atmosphere is acceptable, but the prices are a tad high. I am going to go ahead and give it four stars because I think it definitely serves a purpose well, but the next time I want noodles, I will more than likely head to Spring Mountain Road (aka Chinatown)!",

On Friday and Saturday from 5pm-2am they have local appreciation night with 50% off all food!  I usually get the grilled veggie platter with goat cheese and the Mimo's Salad which has mozzarella, tomatoes and TONS of avocado all chopped up with a balsamic glaze. The pizza there is outstanding. Thin crust and good sauce. I love Grimaldi's pizza but this is definitely on par and much closer to central Vegas. Other yummy orders: cheese plate (lots of variety!), eggplant parmigiana (little single portion), veggie caponata (like a ratatouille), fried rice balls with truffle and ALL the salads are awesome!  Ive been here many times and the chef Mimo is always out greeting the customers which shows that this place really cares about locals and customer service. Head on out there, you'll love it!",

I heard about it from some clients, and my hon of hons husband and I decided to check it out.  The place is definitely old school Italian, with comfy leather booths, a guy playing piano, accompanied by a guy singing Frank Sinatra, and a little dance floor.  Our server was super nice and took great care of us all night. He made wine suggestions, all of which were right on point.  I should make a special point about the wine - the list is enormous and is about 98% Italian wines.  I had a wonderful Pinot Grigio that was almost honey colored, and was freaking incredible.  My HOHH tried a couple of different Barolo's, each of which was better than the prior one.  We ate a LOT - grilled asparagus wrapped with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, a delicious Caesar salad, veal piccata and sea bass with a saffron/lobster sauce.  The sea bass was so good I almost wanted another portion, but managed to control myself.  I don't know how they did it, but the broccoli rabe served with the entrees was almost mellow flavored, rather than the usual bitter taste (which I happen to love).    Five stars, and I will definitely be back.  It reminded me a little bit of the Italian restaurants I used to frequent when I lived in NY, complete with the goombatas at the bar.",

    "text": "Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar is a unique get-a-away, to a land of wonderful, fresh, Authentic Italian Cuisine.  There are very few places where you may have an \"all - around\" experience. With each of your senses tantalized, you cannot help but enjoy Ferraro's Italian Restaurant.  This family owned establishment has boasted over 25 years in Las Vegas, Nevada.  As one of the most influential, top quality, \"Zagat Rated\", Fine Italian Restaurants in the State of Nevada (and in my opinion the U.S.A.), Ferraro's stands out from the rest.  Ferraro's has won many \"Best Of..\" Awards, and I am proud to say that I give them a Five Star Rating as well. To name a few of their \"Awards\", Ferraro's has been named \"Best Recommended By Michelin 2009\", as well as, \"Wine Spectators\" \"Best of Award of Excellence\" From \"Distinguished Restaurants of North America\" in 2008, and \"DiRoNa\" \"Award of Excellence\" 11 consecutive years in a row.\" Just to name a few.  The staff is professional and knowledgeable about all of the menu items. The Family always makes sure that each guest is well taken care of and happy. When you walk into Ferraro's, you get the feeling of \"home\". It's a family atmosphere, with a flair of excellence. Just by looking at the decor in this establishment you know you are in for a treat. I sometimes forget that I am in Las Vegas, Nevada and feel as though I could be right in the heart of Calabria. That is where Gino Ferraro is from. Since 1985, Gino and his Family have taken Italian Cuisine to new heights. In 2003 Gino's Son, Mimmo, took over the kitchen operations and helped transform his families recipes into the very dishes that are served to each guest. This family is not new to the restaurant business, they are just re-inventing it. Having been involved with other family restaurants, they know what to do and how to do it FIRST CLASS!  Have you ever had a server come up to your table and eloquently tell you the specials of the day? Or, when your server remembers all of the menus items verbatim? It is a gift when each server has been trained so professionally. Most of the staff have been with Ferraro's since they opened, and they are considered part of the family. These are some of the small touches that make Ferraro's my favorite Fine Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas. This is a place to see and be seen. If you know good food and you're in Vegas, don't be surprised if you sit near someone famous.  While sitting at the beautiful table in the \"Main Dining Room\" with Walter Ferraro (another important asset to the Family & Ferraro's Restaurant), overlooking the casual ambiance of the rest of the restaurant, my food was ordered and arrived. It was picture perfect. I almost didn't even want to eat it. The dishes were bold and bright with color. The portions are not too big, and can also be family style for sharing. As if I were sitting in Italy the vegetables were so brilliant. The appetizer I ordered was the, \"Carpaccio Manzo\", Thinly Sliced beef, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano, truffle oil. It was so delicious.  My second simply scrumptious dish was the, \"Salsiccia Calabrese\", Ferraro's Homemade spicy sausage grilled, served with crispy polenta, and roasted peppers. As well as, the Imported FRESH Mozzarella.  Did I mention that Ferraro's has the best Homemade Pasta and Pizza to order? It's the real deal! This is what you would order if you were someplace in the middle of Italy.  As I took a bite of my, \"Agnolotti\", Ravioli filled spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce, I was enjoying every minute.  On to my last course (before dessert). \"The Ferraro's House Speciality\", Osso Buco and Baby Lamb Chops. One word for both, OUTSTANDING!  The \"Osso Buco\" fell off of the bone and it was so perfectly cooked I was in heaven. If you love \"Osso Buco\", you should not be reading my review right now. You should be on a plane or in your car on your way to \"Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar\".  If you're a \"Wine Enthusiast\", the selection of wine at Ferraro's is one of the most notorious around. Ask, Joe Pike, the Sommelier to accommodate you. He is happy to help you find the best selection. Ask to see the wine cellar, if you're into that. It is phenomenal.  For those VIP guests, Ferraro's also offers private wine lockers for your special selections.  For dessert, my two favorites are the, \"Authentic Homemade Cannoli\", Trio tower of cannoli filled with smooth ricotta, sugar & cinnamon, with chocolate & raspberry sauces, and the, \"Tiramisu\", a Ferraro's favorite...classic Italian dessert made with lady fingers, Mascarpone cheese & espresso, also homemade.  Ferraro's Wine Bar is absolutely gorgeous. The bar area wraps around from the inside of the dining room to the \"one of a kind\" outside patio. The Patio is well decorated, simply classic, like a summer Italian Garden. Probably one of my favorite spots to sip on a glass of vino and relax.  As a \"Food Critic\" I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ferraro's.",

No buttery aftertaste, like many restaurants have. Oh, at the end they brought a delicious tiramisu with the candle for my birthday. the waiter was very knowledgable, friendly and professional.

Our waiter was extremely attentive, and the food was spectacular. I ordered a dish, ate the entire thing, and had the waiter come up to me to tell me he had given me the wrong meal. I usually don't make a fuss about things of that nature, so I told him to not worry about it because I hadn't even noticed. He was not having it! He proceeded to comp our entire meal, gave us free dessert, and made me my original order to go. Now if that's not good customer service, I don't know what is. I will definitely be returning when I get the opportunity. Thank you Ferraro's for the memorable experience!",

    "text": "Had some friends visiting Las Vegas and they made a reservation here on a Tuesday night at 6:45 pm. We showed up about 20 minutes early and got a table immediately in the back room of the restaurant next to a table that was set up for a large party. Our server, Kimberly, greeted us and went though the water preference, specials and \"things we needed to know\" spiel. My boyfriend was currently doing a water cleanse and was not dining. She was very accommodating and VERY nonjudgemental, engaging him in questions about the cleanse and alerting the bus boys to not fill his water glass throughout our visit. Our friends ordered a nice bottle of wine and I ordered a glass of white (told her I liked sweet and she immediately suggested Moscato which I could not drink fast enough!). I had a caesar salad before my meal  and it was delicious. We shared a beef carpaccio which Kimberly cut and served to us. Again, delicious. Then, on to the main courses. I had lobster ravioli topped with a nice cream sauce and shaved asparagus. TO DIE FOR!!!!! My friends had the rabbit and veal both of which did not disappoint. Dessert was also amazing, we had cannoli, tiramisu, crepes with nutella (!!!!!!!!!!!!) and poached pears. I loved that my cappuccino came with a rock candy sugar stick to sweeten, I have never sent that before. Although Kimberly's large party arrived while we were mid-meal, she remained attentive as did the server assistants. I was more than pleased with my experience and cannot wait to dine here again. Everything was perfect from the first impression, Kimberly's service and to the maitre d' sending us waddling into the night with a handshake. Not going to dinner here is doing yourself a HUGE disservice. Do not miss out on Ferraro's! *** Also they LOVE locals!!!!",

We were a party of 9 and everyone enjoyed their meals.  A few ordered veal piccata or veal marsala and thought the dishes were excellent.

The vino we had felt like satin on my tongue as I let sit.  My dinner, lobster ravioli was out of this world in regards to tenderness of the ravioli, the creaminess and the multiple flavors coming from the cream sauce, and then the texture of the lobster within.    Ferraro's is not on the strip, but just a short cab ride.  When you are ready to pay your tab, the maitre D will arrange a cab to pick you up and take you to wherever your next destination may be.

The restaurant is cozy, they have an extensive wine list, and despite the \"dressed up\" atmosphere, the vibe is relaxed.  The food was great!  Simple Italian preparation with tons of flavor.  I had the Veal - the meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was deliciously tangy.  I ordered the Grilled Asparagus as a side, which was perfectly cooked.  Everyone in our table enjoyed their meals as I heard a lot of yum-yum noises throughout dinner.  Paolo took care of us and was very helpful with wine suggestions (the Chianti he recommended went beautifully with my dish).  At the end of our meal, Paolo surprised us with complimentary dessert!  We each had a tiramisu and canoli - light yet luscious and tasty!    This next part of my review is all about customer service.  Aside from being charming and attentive, Paolo went above and beyond his job description.  He called us two cabs (there were 10 of us) to take us to the Luxor after dinner.  One came and turns out, the second one never arrived.  When our friends finally met us later, they told us that Paolo ended up driving them to the Luxor!  Ferraro's is definitely a must-visit every time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "On behalf of my company credit card and taking a job candidate to dinner, I was able to enjoy an AMAZING MEAL.  I can't afford most high-end restaurants in this town often, but when it's not my money I will certainly go all out!!  It was a bustling Thursday night and the service was excellent - exactly what you expect the service to be when you are paying those kinds of prices.    Our party of 3 started with two appetizers - the calamari and the anitpasta meat/cheese platter.  Both were very good.  I've had better calamari elsewhere and would love to try something else next time.  We enjoyed the house wine, which is a bit cheaper than the others but still tastes very good!    For my main dish, I ordered the Papperdelle Mimmo - served with lobster, scallops, and truffles.  It was by far the best Italian dish I have ever had.  BEST DISH EVER!  Okay, so I'm not Italian, have never lived in an Italian city, and have never had an Italian friend.  So to me, this was straight-up delish Italian food.  I would have licked the bowl if not for the fact that a.) I was interviewing a job candidate who I want to take the job and b.) I didn't want said candidate to know it was such a rare occasion to eat at a place like that on our salaries, which was not yet disclosed to her!    WORD TO THE WISE (and budget friendly diners) - this place is EXPENSIVE.  For my party of three with one person not drinking alcohol, our bill was $222 before tip.  Do I think it was worth the money?  YES.    I am looking forward to trying some lunch specials - which are less expensive - in the near future.  And according to some Yelp reviews here, they offer a LOCALS 50% off - but I wasn't aware of that until now, which is too late.  I also find that hard to believe, but will look into it.",

    "text": "What a great off the strip Italian restaurant!!! Such a refresher from all the cookie cutter really over priced restaurants located inside the hotels! The service was impeccable from the minute you walk in. The staff look like they stepped out of a Al Pacino move.. I mean that in a good way by the way...  The ambiance and the vibe were so up beat that just looking at their menu mad my mouth water. They make all their own pasta fresh, wow no Chef Ragu/Prego working there..  We ordered the antipasti appetizer. It was filled with different kinds of cheese, olives, pickled artichokes, prosciutto, spicy ham. I'm not a fan of olives but the red ones weren't all that bad. It was really good and pair that up with the bread they bring you at the table and you practically have your meal right there. But better save some room for your dinner because you have to try their pasta dishes. I ended up ordering the seafood spaghetti meal that had scallops, huge pieces of shrimp and calamari. I admit it was good but a little too much on the seafood. My BF had the Sea Bass and it was really melt in your mouth type of meal. The fish was cooked to perfection!   I would have given them five stars but I wasn't that crazy about my meal but I am more than willing to go back for more and possibly change it.  Highly suggest this restaurant when in Vegas. It's located behind the Hard Rock Hotel off of Paradise in shopping center that has CVS in it.   Oh and for the ladies.. in that shopping center is a nail salon that is open 24/7.. oh yeah.. I can see it now drunk mani/pedi's...good stuff.. Have to try that one when I go back to Vegas...",

We loved it so much, we ate there twice during our trip, and had wine on the patio a third night.  The service was AMAZING.  Ana took such great care of us, and remembered us the next night we came in.  We dined on the patio one night, as it was a beautiful night in Vegas.  The food is fresh and uncomplicated, pure delciousness.  The first night I had a filet and mushrooms, the sauce was DIVINE.  We had a superb lentil soup, as well. My husband had the buccatini with tomato and pancetta, and it was so good, he ordered it the next time, as did I.  The staff was respectful of my no-cheese request.  The wine list is stellar, as well.    We had two perfect nights of dining here, completely turned me around from thinking Vegas restaurants are over-priced and under-whelming.",

    "text": "I struggled with whether I want to write a review about Ferraro's or not. It's like talking about a broken relationship which started with beautiful moments and ended on a really sour note. It's almost painful to talk about it. But for the sake of yelpers, here goes...  I've been a customer of Ferraro's for more than 10 years. Since it's days on Flamingo. I'd held business lunches, family dinners, business dinners, happy hour gatherings, etc. at Ferraro's. The food was good and the service was impeccable. That all ended one fateful March evening in 2014.  I was hosting a party for 18 business associates. Of course, I had hit up my trusted Ferraro's and made a reservation with them 3 weeks ahead of time, requesting a private dining area. They said OK, it's available. When I got there, I was informed that they at a problem with the reservation and the area was being used by another party. So they sat us at a long table right by the bar. Hmm, I didn't quite like that, but brushed it off. Well, that was the start of the end...  Service was incredibly slow. We couldn't get the attention of our server to get our drinks refilled or orders placed. Then, surprise, surprise, appetizers arrived at our table. Chef's choice. Who ordered those? No one from our table. Ooooh...must be compliments of the chef? But no, I was charged a hefty sum for that, I found out later.  Our server finally came around to taking dinner orders at 8:30pm. I ordered a filet mignon, medium rare. When my steak came, it was so overcooked, there was only a slight hint of pink. At best, a medium well. Definitely not medium rare. I spoke to the server and she said flippantly said \"oh, that's how we do medium rare at Ferraro's.\" What?? Excuse me, even culinary school dropouts know that that ain't medium rare. So I sent it back.  The next time it came out, it was blue. It was seared 2mm on both sides, the rest of the meat inside was as rare as sashimi. Everyone at the table was appalled. I think one of them heard my steak moo. As for me, I was beyond words. Surprised, appalled, angry, disappointed. I try to see it in every positive light possible (steak and eggs breakfast!) but it comes back to one cold hard fact: this was a loud f-you from the chef, to a loyal and very nice customer of 10 years who had spent a lot of money at this joint.   At this point, I realized that our relationship is over. Time to move on. Plenty of fish in Las Vegas...",

Food is excellent, well prepared from fresh ingredients.  I noticed that the quality of waiter service depends on how expensive a wine ordered or # of cocktails.  Otherwise you sit & wait and hard to get waiters attention.  Food runners auction the food delivery like Olive Garden instead of the waiter telling them what each person ordered.  I would suggest avoiding on weekends and try it during a week day.",

The Osso Buco is awesome.  I finally ate outside on the patio and it was great.  All the servers are amazing - if you are looking for a place to take a date, she (or he) will be impressed!  I've been here about 10 times, I come to Las Vegas often (poker tables!) and I almost always come to Ferraro's once each time.  A few months ago I had Thanksgiving dinner here. First time in 50 years that I didn't have turkey!  I had the Dover Sole and it was amazing.  But what makes this place really shine are the wait staff.  Friendly and wonderful without being overly solicitous they make the meal!  Our server for that meal made it my top four dining experiences of all time.  Joe the Sommelier is warm, friendly and very knowledgeable.  Make a reservation (but they usually can squeeze you in anyway!) it gets packed, but I can't think of a better meal in a town known for amazing culinary experiences.  My four best meals NOT in order (perfect food, and even more perfect wait staff): 1) Joe's Stone Crab in Chicago 2) Micheal Mina's in San Francisco (not fair though - they thought I was from corporate and tried to comp my meal (I didn't let them) 3) Ferraro's Las Vegas 4) The Four Seasons NYC",

The last time I had been to Ferraro's it was at the old location and Steve and Edie were at their seats at the bar, so many moons ago. We were seated in the bar area so we could watch the games. It was not an overly busy night in the restaurant and service was good. We ordered the stuffed peppers, tripe, osso buco, spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, rabbit, veal milanese, a special pasta that was supposedly excellent (friend liked it so much he was unwilling to share).  I'm sure I left something out but all in all the meal was fine. The standout for me was the tripe. It was absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly with tremendous flavor (maybe a littler hotter and spicier would have made it best ever), so much so we ordered another with dinner. The specialties were where they fell a bit flat. The osso buco was fairly bland and the meat a bit stringy, almost as if they did not have the best quality meat and not braised long enough. Not bad, just not great and far from a specialty. The same could be said of the rabbit. Fairly bland and unremarkable. All in all it was a very enjoyable evening with friends.  Just not sure I will be rushing back on my next trip.",

    "text": "At first glance this looked like a wonderful restaurant to have a great evening meal. We were greeted by a wonderful hostess, and then it went down hill once we sat down at our table. The waitress unfortunately started on the wrong foot when asked about if they had a Malbec in house, the reply was: Yes, It's $200 and I don't think you can't afford that, and we don't sell it by the glass.  I was stunned!  (My husband had returned to the table) to see me, and the others in a shocked state. I would like  to take the higher road and say that I don't believe she realized what she had said to me.  So in short we settle for the over priced $98 bottle of Ruffino Chianti Classico. The water was great but it lacked the lemon we asked the waitress to bring and received none until we asked the server to bring us some. (With a smile still).   The menu's came and my husband who never complains about anything was taken back by the prices. Thus adding insult to an already injured evening we ordered our perspective appetizers, and meals and carried on conversations to pass the time.  From the ordering of an over priced bottle of wine, ($98) to a menu of food that was good but not off the charts, we could have gotten the same quality and better serve elsewhere. My friend order the Risotto the price was $30.   Risotto!!! Not only was this one the most expensive restaurants, for the quality of food but the service unfortunately didn't add up.  Speaking of service: This evening was so slow that they had a table with a party of 7 who ordered their drinks and their meals up and leave.  Anyway the highlight of the evening:  We found out that if you are a Las Vegas resident you could get 50% off your meals (Alcohol not included of course). Oh! but the waitress forgot to tell my son that...who is a new resident and had left early because of the time. Thank goodness for great friends we met their for dinner. They told us! So that whopping over $400 and then some bill was reduced by the great friends.  So all in all the evening blessing was we got to spend it with our son and our friends who met us their for dinner. No we didn't get dessert!  Being thankful for good and bad experiences teaches us much about life.",

My birthday dinner here was wonderful that we've been looking to come back.   Got Arancini Tartufo for appetizers because those are ultra noms.  Mom and Gma had the same thing as last time- the porcini rubbed ribeye, mac n cheese and green bean sides. It was a little too red for mom in law so they had to refire it. We are barely convincing her that at a minimum to get it medium (pink) and not well done so a bit of red gets her bothered still. After the refire she was fine. Grandma didn't care if hers was a bit more red and enjoyed it.  I grabbed Pappardelle Mimmo (Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, truffle) $39 this time around. It was pretty good, a bit rich. The scallops and lobster was cooked perfectly and pretty generous. What I liked is that they had slice truffle on it and not truffle oil.   BF got Costolette d'Agnello (Double cut premium, Colorado lamb chops served with Sicilian caponata) $39. The lamb was quality but the BF felt it was under seasoned. There are like 5 items the BF has been dedicated to learn to cook perfectly and one is pan seared lamb (chops and racks) so he isn't a kind judge on no seasoning. It was the first thing he ever learned about cooking was how to season. If you put the caponata with a bite of lamb then it does give it flavor but the BF did not like the caponata so he ate some of mom and grandmas green beans and mac with it.   I got a beer this time since last I saw they had some rare and interesting beers that are not distributed to stores. I grabbed Biere Du Boucanier Red ($8 for a bottle) which was a lovely Belgian Pale Ale that was a bit hops from the red pale ale style, a bit the familiar Belgian taste, and was a dry champagne like finish with a bit of sweet. I know there are a bunch of lovely wines, but you know what? I'm in a beer phase and don't fucking care. Craft beer can be high end and refined and it perfectly paired with my dish.   We got some desserts this time around.  White Chocolate Navan Creme Brulee w/raspberries ($7.50). I love creme brulee and this was cooked perfectly. Most places just do vanilla bean brulee so the slight change of flavor was nice.   Poached Pears w/ grapes and vin santo wine sauce and ice cream ($7.50). Nice, light dessert. I wouldnt think cooked grapes would be good, but I like them.   Our server was decent. Nice and kinda funny in a cheesy way.   I loved my birthday dinner, but this one had a few hitches with the food so I can only give this experience 4 stars. I still think it's a good spot though so a future late night Happy Hour will be the next visit.",

It needs to be in all caps because up until this meal I'd been forgoing all gluten....but when they sat the basket of warm focaccia and rolls in front of us with the tangy balsamic/oil dipping sauce I knew I was in trouble. There was no way I wasn't going to eat it and can I just say that I don't regret not one bite! The focaccia is buttery and crispy and chewy...all of my favorite things. The rolls were crunchy on the outside and perfectly airy and chewy on the inside. The oil & vinegar didn't last long. I almost licked the dish. I also ordered a side of their marinara since our main dish wasn't marinara based. So delicious....I can imagine the pasta dishes where that is used are out of this world.  We started with the Beef Carpaccio. It is served with a bed of arugula and fresh Parmesan cheese atop and then Eric squeezed half of a lemon on top of the whole thing and rolled it up for us. I just don't even know how to explain to you how delicious this dish is. Simple, flavorful, and I didn't want it to end.   While I was in the ladies' room, my mom ordered the grilled octopus salad. I can only imagine that Eric recommended the dish as my mom would never, ever order octopus on her own! I was a little worried until it was brought out and I got my first bite. It is served cold, diced up with other amazing things that I am blanking out on at the moment, but it was all perfect together. Interesting texture to get used to, but oh so very tasty.   We shared the Pappardelle Mimmo which is long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, and truffle. So decadent but they also do such a great job of not overwhelming the dishes with any one flavor.   This was a celebratory dinner and it couldn't have been more of a success. Eric took such good care of us along with the rest of the army of servers who made sure we never had an empty glass.",

    "text": "So many glowing reviews and I was just disappointed.   I took my husband here for his birthday dinner. It was between this and his favorite Italian restaurant,  Rao's. I figured I'd take him for something new and exciting. First, I was upset that I had made a reservation specifying that it was a special occasion,  my husband's birthday, and the greeters did not pick up on this or mention it. I was also disappointed to see that they stopped offering the locals' discount as of the New Year.   Next, we were seated without menus and sat for 5 minutes without them. The waiter was not cheerful or pleasant.   I was hoping for a cheese ravioli but the only options included lobster or meat.  I wound up with the gnocchi, which was actually very good. It tasted authentic and homemade.   Dessert rolled around. I had hopes that there would be some nice birthday presentation but, no, they missed the mark completely.    The bathroom was beautiful and spotless but I'll just say this: I hate bathroom attendants. That is all.   The off the strip location was nice. I liked not having to walk through a casino. But this is one instance where I would rather have gone to the strip. No more locals discount and couldn't even go slightly out of the way to make my husband's birthday a little special? You had potential, Ferraro's, but I'm not a happy customer.",

Gino and his staff provide excellent service whether it be a quiet dinner for two or a Retirement party for 60.  Ferraro's is off the strip but definitely a must, from the Calamari appetizers to their famous Osso Bucco everything here is homemade, fresh and five star.  I highly recommend a visit to Ferraro's next time your travels bring you to Las Vegas.  If you're looking for a warm friendly, family owned Italian atmosphere Ferraro's is the place.

We were walking to a concert at Hard Rock; weren't dressed for the lame/empty Lawry's, 15-20 min wait at Fogo Da Cho even though they were totally dead.   Walked past Ferraro's, figured we'd give them a shot. Typically not a fan of Italian food, because, like Mexican food, it's basterdized and dumbed-down considerably in the interest of ignorance and economics. Very rarely do you find a place that actually makes authentic, no holds barred cuisine.  This is one of those places. It's a real old-school genuine Italian restaurant. Lot's of dark wood, low lighting, a menu with names I can't read and some very apropos live music in the bar area. If you're into wine, the list is phone book thick. We flipped through it just for fun, but seemed like lots of depth.  Absolutely outstanding service. Our waiter, Mike (who looked like a close cousin of Vin Diesel), was a True pro. He, along with his support staff in the dining room, were great. Drinks never ran dry, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and everyone seemed happy to be there. We do not have service this attentive and friendly very often.  Pretty big menu, much more than what I initially perused on their website. Daily specials sounded solid, and Mike was able to make some suggestions for me. Girlfriend had an outstanding ribeye, perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. I had some really great tortellini; very rich, great flavor and texture, perfect size portion. You can really tell that the pasta is made everyday in house. Best pasta dish I've had in years.  This place is a True gem, and was certainly the highlight of our quick weekend trip. Highly recommended, and certainly worth the quick drive off-strip to get to it.",

We came in a Friday evening and from the moment we entered the door we were greeted warmly and seated right away. We hadn't even been seated for a moment and our server Eric was there to welcome us. He gave us the wine list which is best described as a \"wine bible\" cause it was so extensive. He asked if we had any preferences on types of wine and guided us to a fantastic moscato sweet white. After taking the drink order he promptly went to the bar with our order. He returned with some wonderful warm bread and excellent oil for dipping. He then returned to the bar to retrieve our drinks.  The wine was great, even better than he described. We finally decided what we wanted to eat with the guidance of Eric who was wonderful at helping us narrow down with his recommendations. My wife had the lobster risotto and I had the fillet with pasta e fagioli. Both dishes were the best we have ever had.  Every bite of the risotto had lobster in it. My fagioli was excellent and the fillet was so tender it melted in my mouth. Since we were visiting for my wife's birthday they brought out a pistachio cream pie. That was wonderful too. All in all this was the best dining experience we had ever had from the moment we walked in till the time we left we felt like we were in Italy.  Eric was funny, engaging and thoughtful in all of his recommendations.",

(Their Spaghettini Scolio (seafood pasta) is fabulous..... so good, in fact, that even though I packed half of it, I decided to eat more when I got home because I was craving it after the drive back home! OINK!) Are your menu choices ridiculously expensive? YES (if you consider said Spaghettini was $36!! Admittedly, the portion could easily have served 2 -- but $36 for pasta is still pricey... even if it does come with a couple of jumbo prawns.) Is anyone surprised at your loyal following? NO! At the end of the day, you are in a class by yourself. You are a family-owned institution in Vegas with fabulous fare served by smiling waiters and there should be more like you for locals to support.",

The service is some of the best we've ever had and the owner is very friendly.",

We were walking into the Restaurant and heard very loud voice from inside.Upon opening the door, an elderly couple were being screamed out by the Owner. Who was yelling at them at the top of his lungs to get the f out of his Restaurant. The older gentleman was very upset and his wife(whose birthday it was 71st) was shaking. They told us that they were locals and had a special offer, and didn't tip correctly and the mgr/owner blew up at them and told them to leave his restaurant. Needless to say, we did not keep our reservation and were just appalled by this situation. His behavior was so vile, that even though I have never written a review on yelp, I felt compelled to document this horrible outburst. The elderly couple were not able to post so in their defense here it is. Do not go to this restaurant, there are so many other great spots in town!!!! Horrible, unprofessional and disgusting behavior for the owner. Unbelievable to say the least!",

The bread came with an excellent oil/pesto/vinegar mix. The carpaccio appetizers were wonderful. I got the house specialty Osso Buco, and the waitress was not kidding when she said no knife is required. It melted and was outstanding. I tried some of my friends' food (boar+pasta and a spinach ravioli something or other), and they were great too.... Excellent beer selection, and a wall full of wines. The wait staff were extremely attentive, knowledgable, and a lot of fun. Even if you're not staying at HRH, you should catch a quick cab from the strip and come try this place out. You wont be disappointed.",

I, being a size two, fit almost anywhere but it was a struggle to get into my seat. Every employe that passed by smiled and welcomed us, but we were not greeted by our waitress until maybe 10 minutes later. When she finally came, she handed us our menus and took our drink order, which took another 20 minutes to finally receive them. I got the special they have for $50 which included your choice of pasta,  excellent, your choice of salad, I got the Cesar salad which was equally tasty, and the medium-well filet mignon, which was.....okay. The special also came with a dessert sampler of a cannoli and tiramisu which were delicious! Overall, the service was alright and did not have the best timing, I mean really, 20 minutes for our drinks? Most servers make conversation with guests but she did not conversate with us. Ferraros was good, but I would not dine here again, us being locals.",

    "text": "Unlike most folks that roll into the glamorous side of Vegas, my wife and I don't have excess money to burn for the sake of the conflagration.  So when we saw Ferraro's proudly proclaiming a 9.95 lunch we were in.    I'm so glad we did it, too.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off of the lunch menu along with a side salad.  I'm not crazy about vinaigrettes to begin with, so when it was only sparsely on the mixed greens, I wasn't thrilled, but I was hungry after an afternoon of libations at the pool, so I ate up.    The entree on the other hand, that's another story.  De-lic-ious.  The meatballs tasted like the ones I remember from my Italian, great-grandmother's kitchen; the sauce wasn't over powering or under-seasoned--simply perfect; and the noodles were cooked just right.  The portion was satisfactory as well.  Our waitress was delightful.  Polite and attentive, but not pandering for tips.  Just a doll (I wish I could remember her name, but I do know she work's the bar and has a tattoo on each inside wrist, so look for her next time you're there).  It's not often that I'm in the middle of Sin City (typically due to the aforementioned monetary setbacks and I just don't much care for Vegas to begin with), but the next time I'm in town and I have the opportunity, Ferraro's is a stop I'll make.",

The atmosphere was perfect, romantic and nostalgic of our first time there which was our first Valentine's Day together. The food was out of this world incredible. I love Italian food, and this place has the most delectable authentic Italian food. However, the most enjoyable part of the experience other than a wonderful night with my fiance was the service. We were waited on by Apollo who made sure we felt like more than just another set of customers, he made us feel like friends, and took excellent care of us throughout the entire night. He answered any and all questions, made personal suggestions on the food, which I trusted and tried something new, and was blown away by the choice. Incredible! I had the CASERECCE, and my fiance had the SPAGHETTINI AGLIO E OLIO, both of which were delicious. The bread was so savory with the olive oil, vinegar and what tasted like a garlic pesto. I had an unforgettable experience and want to thank Apollo again for taking such great care of us, he is a rarity in the service industry and this place is very fortunate to have such a warm, kind man on their staff. Well done all around. We will definitely be back soon.",

    "text": "I've got a bone to pick.  I had always heard rave reviews about Ferraro's, but just never made it.  I guess it's that everyone says that Ferraro's Osso Buco is THE best.  For me, when I see Osso Buco on the menu, that is what I get.  I love the stuff and would eat it every day if I could.  But, I also don't want to be disappointed, as I've had waaay to many  bad instances.  Let's start with the wines.  After much discussion with our waiter, who either was very knowledgeable or was pushing stuff the restaurant hasn't been able to get rid of (I do give him the benefit of the doubt and think he was quite educated), he recommended the 2003 Palari Faro.  I hadn't even heard of the grape, let alone the region it comes from.  It was enlightening and tasted pretty good, too.  For a second bottle, I ordered the 2001 Pio Cesare Barbaresco.  This was a relative bargain on the wine list.  Over all, I have to rate our server pretty high for his expertise and ability to navigate the list.  Where I have to subtract is from the wine service itself.  While our glasses were never empty (definitely a good thing), our server continuously poured wine to top us off.  It felt rushed.  I would have liked to see the bottom of my glass at least once.  Anyway, I'll skip to the food...that IS why you're reading this, right?  We order three appetizers:  (1) Carpaccio Torcello, which is basically beef carpaccio - the color and texture exude freshness, like it definitely wasn't sitting pre-sliced in the cooler for days (like at some other places).  It was good; however, it just didn't have enough beef flavor for my taste.  (2)  Carpaccio di Tonno (tuna carpaccio) - this was really fresh and the accompanying salsa-looking mixture was refreshing.  The tuna itself had a nice crust that gave the tuna an earthy aroma and flavor.  (3) Burrato, Proscuitto, Rucola - this was like a salad with melted mozzarella and proscuitto.  Interesting mix of crunchy, creamy and chewy.  Good stuff and my favorite of the three.  For dinner we had the...Osso Buco.  All three of us.  The shank was nicely tender, which is where too many places fail miserably.  IMHO, it could have been a little more moist, but soaking the bites in the sauce definitely made up for that.  The sauce was really nicely done and very balanced: it was rich but not overwhelming, it wasn't salty but had good flavor and, most importantly, it did not counteract with the wines.  Impressively done.  The grains on the side (I can't remember what it was called) were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle and was a nice complement in texture to the rest of the dish.    Ah, but how can I end the review without mentioning the bone marrow?  I picked that bone dry.  It was buttery and fatty and just was astounding with the flavor of the sauce.  My companion never ate marrow before, but convinced him to give it a try.  While I don't think he's completely hooked, I did see him picking a lot of marrow out of that bone.",

    "text": "Feeling a little peckish late at night, but not wanting to hit a casino, we checked Yelp, it came up with Ferraro's, it also showed that there was a late night menu that was 50 % off, worth the risk.  The food was ok, it could have been great, but the small things were off. My wife had the Carbonara, I had the Gamberoni pizza.  The carbonara was ok, there was just a little something missing, I couldn't place my finger on it, but it lacked something, I still can't place my finger on it, if I do figure it out I will edit this review. I will say, the pasta was cooked perfectly.  The pizza intrigued me, I had something similar at this place :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pizza-bistro-scottsdale-2\">yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pi...</a>  It is a pizza, with potato,  pancetta, shrimp, mozzarella. Oreganos makes it without the shrimp.  To be 100% frank I was worried about the combination, I couldn't get my head around shrimp being on this pizza, but I was happily surprised, the shrimp turned out to be the best part. This could of been a great pizza, except the potato was cut to think. If cut thin like Oregano's makes it the potato gets a little crispy adding a great texture to the pizza.  We really did like the setting, we sat outside by the fire pit, it was a nice way to have a late night dinner. The service was very good, attentive without being intrusive.  The 50% deal meant a check of just under $50, not a bargain for sure (including a glass of wine) but an ok price for what we got, if it had been at full price I don't think I would have been happy, so take advantage of the specials.",

The chopped salad was the best I've ever had.    Main entrees;  had to get the osso bucco and it didn't disappoint.

We started our meals with wonderful warm bread served with balsamic vinegar, olive oil  and caper mixed.  One of our party had the special of the day Sea Bass which Virgilio highly recommend and turned out to be the best Sea Bass he had ever tasted and coming from the NW that says a great deal. I had veal with a caper sauce which had a balance of flavors paired with broccoli rabe. The bitterness of the broccoli  really balances with the creaminess of the sauce and the brine taste of the capers. The others in our party also spoke extremely high of their meals and stated it was the best meal the have had in Las Vegas.  Our server Virgilio was not only a very gracious waiter but was informative with suggestions, recommendations, knowledge of the food and preparations but also was easy to get along with in a teasing manner and would ask for him next time we dine there.  I must mention that we did receive a very special treat from a gentleman who does a fantastic private magic show randomly at tables, if he offers to do one at your table make sure to watch closely it is excellent.   Five days later back at the office we are still talking about how great Ferraros was and look forward to next years trip to Las Vegas so we can visit again.",

Thanks to Susan R for hooking me up w/ the link for $50 off cuz I probably wouldn't have tried this place out if I didn't have it.    You could easily spend $100 by yourself.  The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....  How can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.  My wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???  The waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.  I guess the only thing that would hold me back from coming back here would be the price.  I'd be interested to see how it is for lunch.  I know we'll go back again before the coupon expires.  This is definitely the best Italian I've had in Vegas.",

I'd say it's more like a nice neighborhood restaurant. If you're looking for traditional family owned an operated Italian cuisine this is the place! Gino and his family will ensure you'll have an AMAZING experience. Recently dined and just can't say enough about this place - from the delicious food to the impeccable service - you can't go wrong! They are known for their Osso Buco but the filet is one of the most tender I've had, I also recommend the Pappardelle Mimmo with scallops and lobster - simply incredible! We had a nice gentleman named Josh that had some excellent recommendations and paced the evening at a very nice pace and made sure the evening was memorable. We also noted they have a really nice Happy Hour. Thank you to Josh, Gino and his family and staff for such a wonderful meal and evening. Grazie!",

Gianni took such good care of us and turned us on to a new favorite wine with his excellent recommendation.   We loved the food so much we came back again our second night in Vegas! Prosciutto was so fresh on our appetizer. The homemade sausage and Rappini app was perfect with our Amarone Valpolicella wine (thanks Gianni). The lobster risotto is perfection. Lasagna is delicious  Cappuccino to finish it off  Thank you Ferraro's We will be back to Vegas just for your!",

The bar and dining room have an upscale, informal vibe, with lots of little private and semi-private dining areas (and probably the cleanest washrooms I've ever seen.)   But what brought it all full circle was great service and confident recommendations by the owner and server.  Our party of five covered most of the menu and enjoyed the osso buco, ribeye (oh, the ribeye!), fish, and several different pasta dishes - all fresh and delicious. The young sommelier was quick with a spot on recommendation - a Tuscan blend that complemented the food perfectly.   Vegas is a town built on sizzle, but the real color and value is off the strip. At places like Ferraro's. Highly recommended!",

Tom, our waiter was very friendly and greeted us on our special occasion.",

    "text": "We have been fans of Ferraro's for almost 30 years, when the restaurant was on Flamingo. Along the way, we attended a retirement dinner for an Italian Catholic minister there. One of my all-time favorite dishes is Ferraro's osso buco, though I would prefer it to be accompanied by risotto rather than faro.   My sister was here on an airport layover on Monday (May 13) evening. We went to Ferraro's.   The menu states that pasta is served al dente, though customers can request that it be \"over-cooked.\"  I ordered the bucatini, and my sister ordered the ravioli. Both were al dente to the extreme--imagine biting into year-old chewing gum. Definitely the least satisfying dining experience there in three decades....and, if I might add, the dishes were not inexpensive. I don't remember their pasta dishes ever being that tough.   I don't want to dissuade diners from going to Ferraro's--it always had been great. But I think I'd advise getting the \"over-cooked\" pasta, with the disclaimer that I don't know what the server's or chef's reaction would be.",

    "text": "Where's the button for the 6th star?  As we walked in, I noticed an exquisite Mercedes S Class parked in front with the license plate \"NEBBIOLO\". I assumed it must be the owner's car. Only a True Italian wine aficionado would think to personalize his license plate with one of the finest Piedmontese red wine grape varieties. If this was in fact the case, I figured we would be in for a real treat.  And what a wonderful, wonderful dining experience we had. From the second we were warmly greeted by the lovely hostess, and promptly seated, things only kept getting better and better.  Our waiter Eric was not only warm, attentive, knowledgable, and professional, but he displayed a True enthusiasm for his work. I have seldom seen a waiter exude such a genuine pride in the food that he serves. He described each dish and ingredient with impeccable detail and knowledge. When the dishes were served, his positive energy was so palpable that we could barely wait to dig in. Without a doubt, one of the finest waiters I have ever had the pleasure to dine with.  Sommelier was a delightful gentleman from Torino, who went over the wine list, in perfect Italian (obviously - yet quite intimidating for me), in great detail. We opted for an excellent value San Felice that was very well received by all of our guests.  We opted for a trio appetizer of beef carpaccio, seared Mediterranean octopus, and burrata salad. The carpaccio was made with thin slices of beef, arugula, and shaved Parmigiano - delicious. The octopus was very tasty and tender; served with kalamata olives, potatoes (very nice touch) and fried capers (flavor explosion - wow!). Lastly, the burrata salad was excellent, surrounded with thinly shaved spicy carrot salad and pesto. The pesto tasted more like almonds than pine nuts. Very nice.  Primo was homemade gnocchi. Just like my nonna used to make - simple tomato basil sauce was perfect. Gnocchi were tender and tasty.  For secondo, we went for the ossobuco. (might as well since we heard so much about it). It did not disappoint. Perfectly braised, delectable sauce and served with faro, which was a nice old-school touch and a pleasant change from the standard risotto. They even had a special spoon for the bone marrow...ahhhhhh! :)  Chocolatissimo for dessert was outstanding and hazelnut gelato was perfect. We even got a tour of their stunning wine cellar. I was drooling at the selection of Gajas....  We can't wait to be back. Grazie mille!",

Servers are very attentive without being in your face even during the rush of happy hour.  We ordered a few food items including two ginormous charcuterie boards. Arancini, meatballs, Margherita pizza,    and calamari.  The olives, mushrooms etc. on the charcuterie were drenched in oil. Not a fan.  The pizza was very tasty and I would order it again.  Those meatballs were very bland and tasted like some frozen Trader Joe's.  Big bummer because I love a good meatball.  It had been a few years since I've been here but I remember the food being delicious. Maybe we got the kitchen on an off night.  Although some of the food was lacking, would still return for happy hour and to give the dinner menu a chance.",

It was a party of 6; my family of 5, with 3 college sons, one of whom rendezvoused with a college friend at the restaurant.  Ferraro's was accommodating, changing our table to 6 from the 5 reserved.  And service was beyond adequate, good to very good I'd say.  The food on the other hand was beyond disappointing!  The filet and ribeye, both ordered med rare, were med well.  Neither tasted good enough to compensate.  I'd have been embarrassed if either came off my grill.  The pasta was not al dente, but over cooked as well; pasty ... my wife didn't eat it.  Now back to the prices ... the ribeye was split, the college friend ordered a salad and appetizer only, there were 3 GLASSES of wine consumed, and the bill with tip (the servers shouldn't suffer for the kitchen) was over $400!!!  Needless to say, we do not recommend Ferraro's.",

We ordered the prosciutto with buffalo mozzarella, boar ragu with bucatini instead of gnocchetti and the tortellini. The pastas just seemed to be lacking flavor and somewhat bland. I really wanted to like the food but couldn't. Sadly, my favorite part of the meal was probably their bread with their dipping sauce. After the dinner, we said we would've been better off going to Maggiano's instead, even though it's Americanized Italian, but at least we would've left satisfied with our meal.   The service was okay and the staff seemed like they were rushing and not once did our server check up on us after we received the entrees to see if everything was okay. We probably saw him only a few times throughout the meal and that's including when we first arrived and when we asked for the check.",

The bartender has a very strong pour which was even better.! I went during the week so it wasn't as busy which made the ambience even better as the restaurant was quiet.

Furious ! I love pasta & am an Italian women. I could've went anywhere else to set reservations tonight & now everywhere is booked thanks to me relying on FERRARO'S to be reliable. There was more things he said but that last remark just topped it off. Don't go to this location unless you want to be treated like crap & spend 100-200$ while receiving horrible customer service. & Now to top it off the person that responded to this is so unprofessional & still can't even take accountability, the food wasn't the problem THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS THE ISSUE. The food I was asking about was on YOUR MENU. How is that American food when it's on YOUR ITALIAN menu lmfao so rude & still unprofessional!!! \"Doomed from the beginning\" is that because me & my fiancee are part of the LGBTQ  family? DISCRIMINATION at its finest how sad. We were so excited to eat here I'm not sure how you got any \"doomed\" feelings towards any of your customers.

The pine nuts complement the fennel and Arugula perfectly.   For my entree, at the waiters recommendation I took a chance and ordered a special. It Was So Good!   It is made with Homemade 30 yolks Taglierini pasta  with sea urchin and a ginger carrot sauce. It was perfect! Highly recommend. I was super nervous as I've only had sea urchin in sushi, but I wanted to be a little adventurous... It was totally worth it! So good.   The waiter also chose a selection of deserts for us. The Amaretto Pistachio cookie was my favorite. This is definitely a great place for a nice meal but also perfect if you want to impress someone. They also have a very extensive and impressive wine list. Don't be intimidated!  I love when a dinner is amazing from top to bottom. The review writes itself.",

    "text": "We had an excellent dinner at Ferrarro's while recently in Vegas.  We had reservations for 8pm, but got there a little early and decided to have a drink or two at the bar.  When we were ready, we were quickly taken to a table and told about that night's specials.  My husband and I both got the Chicken Scalloppini.  It was excellent.  It came with potatoes & asparagus.  We wanted to substitute pasta for the potatoes, but that was an upcharge which was a little annoying.  We elected to split a side-dish of pasta with butter & garlic and were so glad we did. Neither of us were crazy about the potatoes, and it was nice to top the pasta with our chicken.  The asparagus was perfectly cooked, and we really enjoyed our dinner.  We especially enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant.  It was a nice break from the Strip.  I can see this being a great place to bring clients for dinner, as well as for families.  Very intimate feeling and welcoming.",

    "text": "I originally choose Piero's for our last dinner in Las Vegas.  A local bartender at the Venetian convinced me otherwise.  Overall, we had a positive experience here.  Here's some of the good things and not so good things.   Our waiter was nice enough but a little rough around the edges for a fine dinning restaurant.   Caesar salad and fried calamari were brought out all at once.  Dinner started out rushed.  We were in no hurry to celebrate our 28th anniversary dinner.  The pace slowed down as dinner went on.   I went to wash my hands before dinner.  Maybe it's just me, but I absolutely hate it when I enter a rest room to find I have a new friend in there waiting for me.  Yes, the dreaded bathroom attendant!  No!  I haven't come across one of these guys for over ten years.    Of course he wants to chat me up, offer a second paper towel to dry my hands.  I can't wait to get out of there.  I just find a bathroom attendant unnecessary and uncomfortable.  Thank God I just needed to wash my hands.  I'm a big boy now, I can do it all by myself.  Thank you.  I really wanted veal parmigiana for dinner.  It's not listed on the menu.  No chicken parmigiana either.  We called and they said yes, we have the veal, bone in as a special.  Great I thought.   When I went to order our waiter said it's not on special but we can make it anyway.  I guess you can always get it but you have to ask for it.  Why not just list it on the menu along with the chicken parmigiana which I'm sure they can make all the time as well?  I found that to be a bit confusing.  That being said, that veal parmigiana was one of the best I've ever had, ever.  Phenomenal! When it was brought to the table the first thing I thought was where's the pasta?    No pasta with this I was told.  Only broccoli rabe which was fine but not what I would serve with a parmigiana.  Our waiter should have asked me what I wanted as a side I think.  He did not.  I've never been to a restaurant that did not include a side of pasta with a veal parm dish.  I asked the waiter and he said a side of pasta was going to be an additional $12.00.  A little 2 oz. portion of pasta would have been perfect.  $12.00?  No thanks.  My GF had the lobster risotto.  She said it was good, but the rice was a little under done but good none the less.    Our waiter brought out some Tiramisu that had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it.  Thank you for a nice evening Ferraro's!  Nice restaurant. Good food. Good drinks and wine. Okay waiter. Should add more available options as to what's available on the menu. Unnecessary bathroom attendant.",

He is the sommelier and would be happy to answer any questions.  Another great sign!  Based upon our meal, his recommendation for a red wine from Alba was incredible.  Full bodied, smooth, and paired well with both a beefy bolognese as well as some seafood.  Ask for Paolo!  Our server Michael was friendly and provided fantastic service as well.  Fritto Misto:  just like what we had in Northern Italy.  Fried calamari, shrimp, sardines, endives and some red pepper was served with a creamy tangy dipping sauce.  Simple but delicious.  Caesar salad:  Whole leaves tossed with parmesan and a creamy light anchovy dressing.  The side order of anchovies was plentiful.  Bolognese:  Ground beef in tomato base with al dente green & white taglatelle.  Delicious!  Tarajin with Crab and corn in a creamy uni sauce:  The only time I've had tarajin was in Alba during tartufo season last year.  The pasta is exactly the same (made with 30 egg yolks)!  It was delicious.  I loved it paired with the house pinot grigio.  Only negative?  I wanted fresh truffles!  Trippa:  just like we had in Rome.  It was the most tender and simmered in a rich tomato stew.  If you like offal then you will love this!  The restaurant is massive and can cater to large and private parties.  It's pricey but definitely worth it!",

Based on the 43 dollar price tag, they should have been as great as the scallops.

The waiter suggested a delicious pinot and a wonderful seafood pasta. The pasta noodles were made in house,  had asparagus, scallops and lobster with a light sauce on a generous sized portion for about $40 (which I felt was reasonable given the amount of seafood in the entree).   I've never had food served so quickly!  My water was never more than half empty and the wait staff were highly attentive.  I would definitely return to this restaurant next time I'm in Vegas.  Amazing wine menu and scrumptious cannolis. Highly recommended.",

Because it was late, we were not interested in eating a lot. In response to my wife's question, the waiter recommended a salad to which she added grilled shrimp; it was both delicious and beautifully presented.  I was in the mood for a light pasta and also accepted a recommendation for a pesto sauce; again, delicious.    Service was perfect, friendly but not overly so, knowledgeable, and timely. Decor is upscale and tastefully done.    While we each enjoyed a cocktail and did not order wine and did not talk with the sommelier (again, it was  Late), this appears to be a spot for serious wine lovers, particularly Italian wines.  The wine list was in a two-inch leather-bound notebook and nearly all of the offerings seemed high end. I am not knowledgeable on Italians, but the two domestics that I knew and checked were highly rated and fairly priced.",

I wanted to take my parents here while they were in town for a convention, so along with them accompanied 15 other colleagues, so we had a very large party that Ferraro's accommodated so very well. The entire evening was such a pleasure. From the service, to the food, to the ambience...it was all a real treat once again. Every food item, drink, etc. is simply to die for. I had the Vitella Piccata this time for my entree, definitely the best piccata I've ever had. Everyone at the table enjoyed their dinner, at least 5 of the guests had the Ferraro's famous Osso Bucco dish and were more than impressed. Our appetizers, drinks, etc. were made to perfection as well. As a token of the restaurant's appreciation for us coming in, they literally brought each guest at our table a complimentary dessert sampler plate with three mini desserts. I generally do not like cannolis or crepes, but their renditions along with their house tiramisu, I was in heaven...as was everyone else at the table. A job well done as always, Ferraro family & staff! I cannot wait for the next time.",

    "text": "After driving around aimlessly deciding where to grab a weeknight dinner, we settled on Ferraro's. We were seated immediately, and both the sommelier and our server greeted us instantly.   We ordered the burrata appetizer, my husband got a salad, I had the bucatini, he had the rabbit, and we split a side of rapini. I had the pistachio dessert and he had death by chocolate.  I got a glass of prosecco after seeing there was a free glass of wine with yelp check in, and our server said great, I redeemed the offer, and she brought it out. (I was surprised later when it was on the bill, and she said it was her second day and she would need to ask. Then returned to tell me the offer didn't apply to anything but house red or white...okay, well that would have been good to know. Whatever...too late at that point.)   The burrata was good, as was the sopressa, but there were only two very small slices of meat, 4 would have been more appropriate for the $18 price point, imo.   The bucatini was very good, and I brought half home with me because I overheard the next table discussing the pistachio dessert, and decided that was happening.  The sauce was perfect, and the fresh pasta had an excellent texture. I noticed they had paleo pasta on the menu that I thought was interesting.   My husband enjoyed his rabbit, though he thought the portion was a little small.   Loved the rapini, it needed chopped or something because it was awkward to eat.   We agreed I made the better dessert choice with the pistachio dessert. His death by chocolate was good but we both loved the pistachio. He ended up conning me out of over half of mine.   Overall I would probably come back for happy hour, or dessert, but for the price (around $175) I think we could  have had an equal or more impressive dinner for much less $$, at another local place like Chef Marc's or Nora's, or on the strip at Giada.  The staff were really attentive, almost to the point though that it was uncomfortable - at any given time I felt like someone was watching us eat. Maybe it was just our table placement in the middle of the room, but it felt awkward. (I didn't want to break out my light in the middle of the dark dining room, so no pics.)",

Rest of the food came in tiny portions as well and way overpriced for the taste and quality especially for a happy hour menu.

    "text": "I have eaten at this restaurant about a dozen times and always been impressed by their food (but sadly, neglected to review it during the good times).  Fortunately, at the time, my companions made it a point to post positive reviews of the restaurant.  So, when I had relatives visiting from out of town, looking for a late night meal, I proudly recommended Ferraro's.   The restaurant could not possibly have made me look worse than with the sad events earlier tonight.  The back patio - normally quiet and sane - was booked for a private party and it was loud and rocking.  No problem by itself, but I wonder if it left the dining room understaffed.  Not to belabor the details, but the meals we were served would have been terrible by Olive Garden standards.  Each of our three entrees were served cold (you'd have to heat them a few degrees to get to lukewarm) and were mostly inedible.  The fact that all three of us left 80% of our meals untouched was clearly lost on the busboy who was surprised that none of us requested a doggy bag.  After waiting 45 minutes for our food to arrive, none of us was in the mood to even consider a re-order even if it had been offered - which (it's important to note) it was NOT.  Our waitress simply dropped off our check and rushed off to the next table.  I don't know if any of this was because the kitchen was overwhelmed, or if the one lone waitress in the dining room didn't bring them out quickly enough - and quite frankly I don't care.  It may have been just another day on their schedule and - oops - they messed up during a pre-booked party, but it was a very important event in my life and that meal was simply unacceptable.    Certainly by my previous experiences, and by the reviews of others on this page, your odds favor a good experience.  But I like to leave my gambling at the tables and - now that this restaurant is clearly not a sure thing - take my business elsewhere.  Oh, yes... shame on you, Ferraro's.  When you stop caring about one customer, how long before you stop caring about them all?  Keep offering 1/2 off deals for locals and then treating us like crap. It's a guaranteed long-term recipe for failure.",

    "text": "Again - another place in town that I don't understand the hype.    This was my first meal after doing the Buffet of Buffets Yelp event - and I was really hating food, so this review might be a little biased somewhat.  I am unsure however if I would go back and try it again.  My husband and I had a friend in town, and choose this place to take him to because we were armed with a $50 off certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>.  We figured for that much, we'd get a lot of food and wine between three people.  Instead, I felt that he prices were really inflated for what we ate and even with the discount, it was one of the most expensive meals I've had in town.  I don't mind paying a ton if the quality is there (see my gushing review for Carnevino), this wasn't really worth it.  This was a few months ago so I don't remember everything we ordered, admittedly.  My husband ordered a simple spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the Dover Sole, and we had one more entree that escapes me.  But between the three entrees, two salads, and a glass of wine, and with our discount the bill was about $250 dollars which I felt was not real reasonable when I remember all of the meals where I have paid that much.  The quality, while certainly somewhat tasty, it was not remarkable enough to warrant those prices.    I can think of many other Italian restaurants in town that are equal or surpasses the quality here and is priced much more reasonably.  Don Vito's in South Point, Pasta Shop Ristorante, is another.  And I hate to say it - but Bucca de Beppo and Olive Garden was more preferential to me than eating here.  This might be a good place if you are a tourist, but for the money I would stay on the strip and try some of the high-end Italian places like Bartolotta, Sinatra's, Rao's, or Nove.  You'll pay in the same range as Ferraro's but have a much more satisfying experience.",

    "text": "After my meal at Ferraro's, I found that it could be viewed in one of two ways...as a local or as a visitor/tourist.  As a local I could go as high as a 4/5, but as a tourist it could be as low as a 2/5, so I split the difference.  The main reason is price.  Before going to Ferraro's I checked out the menu online and thought, \"man this places must be fancy, maybe this is an off-strip gem\" (since it was suggested by a long-time Vegas resisdent, myself being new to the area).  The decor was nice, staff friendly, the bar wasn't bad either.  For me there is always that bit of hesitation when all the starters, salads, soups on the menu are $10-$20 because it tends to cause expectations to go up.  I will say the apps were pretty good.  My brother-in-law got a pizza which looked like nothing special but he did clean his plate.  I went with the sausage and peppers which was definitely good, but not a $14 app.  I mean sausage and peppers should be about as cheap as it comes.  My wife went with the Chef Mimmo salad which was also good.  The avocado was very fresh as is common in this parts and the balsamic and mozzarella was good as well.  It was a different take on the salad because all the ingredients were served as cubes or chunks and tossed together.  For my entree I went with the Filet.  It was probably below average.  Cooked right but very plain, not a lot of flavor at all, not a $41 filet. The veggies were standard, nothing special there.  However, the mashed potatoes were clearly of the instant variety.  The only reason I took a second bite was to confirm the first was actually that bad.  My wife went with the porcini rubbed rib-eye.  This was much better than the filet but still not a $48 entree.  Now for the savings grace...locals get 50% OFF with a local ID.  I didn't scour the bill in detail since the wife took care of it, but I'm not sure if the discount applied to all food or just entrees.  Either way, this made the meal much more tolerable.  I went from thinking her meal at $48 was wildy over priced and thinking I'd much rather pay an extra $10-$20 at a high end place on the strip, to thinking, this isn't a bad meal for $24.  If I were to go back, I would probably try out some seafood or pasta options versus the beef, but at 50% I can say that I could see myself going back.  However, if you are a tourist staying across the street at the Hard Rock and looking for other options, I might try to look elsewhere for some better value.",

    "text": "On our last trip to Las Vegas we wanted to join a friend who lives there for dinner but I was ready to get off the Strip. He is a server at one of the Casinos so he hit up his other friends for a great restaurant since he knows we much we eat out. Funny enough he said he was nervous because when he comes to Denver I take him to super good places.   We got there on a Thursday afternoon after the lunch rush. The server seemed very excited to have people who were ready to dine and drink wine. I can only imagine he was use to people rushing to get back to work.   We had such a great experience and the food was amazing. We were there for several hours and just didn't want to leave. The ambiance was beautiful and we were able to enjoy the shaded patio. I love going in ethnic places and the staff still have their accents. It made me feel like there might have actually been Italians in the back cooking.   In the end we were all debating over dessert. We finally decided on the creme brulee, but the server was so great he brought a second plate with samples of all the other desserts. That was the cherry on top of an amazing sunday.   Would I go back? Definitely! Would I recommend it to others? I already have. I never knew that place was there when I lived in Las Vegas and now I'm sad I missed out.",

It really ruined my night because of the server and stuff. My main dish that i ordered took long time to come to my table. I saw her came to my desk again and agian but never asked me nothing. I waited my main dish for long time. When i asked her if my main dish is coming she rolled her eyes and told me because i had my food on my table she did not bring the main meal. She never asked me \" would u like me to bring ur main meal while u have still working on salad?\" Or anything like that. She seems really upset that i asked her to bring my main dish asap. From her attitude I really can tell she was not happy serving us so I told her \"please do not mad at me\" After that and until I left the restaurant she was giving me fake smile with no talking. She seems like having a lots of conversation and spending a lot time with next table customers but when she was at my table she was being very short with us. I was just very disappointed the services that I got. Seems like they don't like me at all so  I am sure they won't see me ever again.",

At 9PM at night this large restaurant was filled with diners, and we were a party of four, two of which have been here previously.  The food is outstanding, prices are competitive.   I ordered a Cesare salad that was excellent, and Osso Buco, a favorite of mine. My wife ordered  a spinach, arugula, mixed berries, roasted walnuts, percorino cheese salad and braised short ribs.

Waiters I talked to were all 3 Italian, or mastered a fake italian accent, o e or the other, which was nice. I got a free appetizer sampler by checking on on Yelp which had a bologna ravioli and a mushroom pasta dish that was all right.   I ordered the Bufala mozzarella and  prosciutto  appetizer, which I have provided a photo of, and it was amazing. I wish it had more cheese but it's real and expensive ($21). The prosciutto was very good as well.  For the main course I had the Lobster Asparagus ravioli (also supplied a photo) in a light wine cream sauce which was also good but I could tell the lobster had been frozen. However, that did not stop me from eating every bite.  For dessert i had the white chocolate Montenegro creme brulee, which tasted fine however I couldn't taste the white chocolate, just tasted like normal creme brulee to me.  Overall a nice restaurant a little on the pricy side, although this is Vegas, and good service. I will be back to try their more exotic items on their menu, which includes a rabbit dish they say is their best dish, and a grilled octopus dish, and recommend you give them a try.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week Meal #8 (Dinner for $50.13): Appetizer (Choice of 2): Risotto Funghi OR Agnolotti OR Gnocchi Bolognese OR Penne Pomodoro  Salad: Mista del Casa OR Caprese di Bufala OR Cesare  Entree: Osso Buco OR Pollo Piccata OR Vitello Saltimboca OR Salmon Marecchiaro  Dessert Sampler  The appetizer option was a bit confusing because it says \"choice of 2\" - so we were thinking each person gets to pick 2 appetizers - nope! It's choice of 2 appetizers per table. So, what if you were eating  by yourself? So, we ordered calamari on top of the RW items. Appetizers and certain menu items are 50% off for locals.  The service was great. Very kid-friendly. They have high chairs and our server, Paolo was entertaining kids.   Calamari (regular menu): Tender pieces of squid lightly breaded and seasoned with a side of marinara. This was not chewy at all. 4/5  Agnolotti: Ravioli filled with mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella and spinach, topped with cherry tomatoes. 4/5  Gnocchi Bolognese: Potato dumplings with Bolognese meat sauce. I love gnocchi and theirs is freshly homemade. Tender potato pillows with tender pieces of meat. Although I prefer alfredo sauce, the Bolognese meat sauce was yummy. 5/5  Mista del Casa: Mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette. Nothing that tickles anyone's pickle...it's salad. 3/5  Caprese di Bufala: Bufala mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil and pine nuts drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The usual caprese. 4/5  Osso Buco: Braised veal shank with farro. Very tender meat and good marrow. The sauce was perfect and not thick. 4/5  Pollo Piccata: Chicken breast, capers, lemon, butter and white wine. The 2 pieces of chicken breast weren't that tender but the sauce was great. 3.5/5  Dessert Sampler: Tiramisu and cannoli. The tiramisu wasn't super soaked in alcohol - I didn't taste alcohol at all. The cannoli was one of the best I've had.  Crisp shell and the filling was just divine. 5/5",

We are a flight crew and travel all over the world, this was a last minute stop. We walked in and were given a table we told the waiter (Daniel) we had a coupon from Yelp for a free glass of wine with an entree. Daniel told us no one per table, I told him we were a flight crew and this was going to be three separate tickets. His exact words were were...\"good for you, the menu says Ferraro's not Daniel's.... extremely rude.  We come to Las Vegas and generally stay close to this location. I will never be back. Don't waist your time with a over priced spaghetti house and rude servers! Unfortunately I can't give zero stars!",

    "text": "The food is good, but I personally think it's a bit overpriced for my liking. I'm not big on paying a ton of money for food when I can get the same quality, quantity and service somewhere else.   It is good and it is a nice restaurant. If you're looking to take out some on a fancier date...then yes. Splurge to impress.   They have a very large wine selection, and that's always a plus.   We had the cesar salad - you can definitely tell they make their own dressing. It had a fresh garlic taste and it made for tasty breath.   For dinner -  Osso Bucco - Of course, very tender. I wasn't a fan of the sauce and I'm also not a fan of veal. My boyfriend did like it though and he did order it. If you love veal, I'm sure you'd enjoy this dish.   Pappardelle Mimmo - I liked this dish a lot. It wasn't overpowered by butter or oil like a lot of places do for their butter sauces. It had a very distinct smell of truffles and they also serve a large portion of lobster in the dish. They served it with two large scallops which I would have preferred it to be pan seared. They were steamed very well to where they were not chewy though. Overall - very tasty dish.   The service was good - it wasn't extraordinary. They were very good at making sure we had water/wine at all times. The server was nice a polite. I kind of noticed that this place has a lot of older people and they seem to cater more towards that crowd. The reason I say this is - there were two tables with older couples in nicer attire and they were served much quicker than we were. There was a table of four (same size party as us) that was sat about 10 minutes after us. Within 2 minutes, they were served water, bread and the drinks they ordered. We didn't even get asked about drinks other than wine until after them.   The other odd thing is, the waiter gave us our tab and we told him how we wanted it split up. He took the two cards (our tab was over $300) and then he brought it back with his 18% gratuity on there. It was not listed on there before. Not that we wouldn't have tipped him. My bf and I typically tip 20% in most cases, but that was definitely a turn off. I didn't remember seeing this anywhere, but in a nicer place like this - I think it's a bit tacky.   So I'm half and half on this place. Maybe I'll go back....maybe I won't. :)",
