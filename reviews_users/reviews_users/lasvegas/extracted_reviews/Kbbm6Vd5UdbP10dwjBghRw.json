I don't usually get fast food often but when I do it is at in-n-out. Animal style is amazing and if you want to be healthier you can get it protein style (lettuce instead of buns). If you are visiting from the east coast or mid-west you have to try in-n-out at least once! This location is great for me because its close to my house.   The service here was also good. There was a young man there who made sure we were enjoying our meal and took our garbage away when we were done. I thought this was really nice because I usually take the trash out myself and it was nice of him to do it for us.",

(I was number 16 and there was only one other couple who ordered ahead of me) families with larger parties received their food faster and it was only me and one other person. I'm still giving them 3 stars because the quality is still great but they might need to figure out how to stay in order of the orders or at least relatively close to it.",

I really enjoy In N Out but I'll go to this location rather than Trop just because of his guest service and the other people making the food and presenting it.   If I ever ever ran a business of my own I would follow in the founder of In N Out's foot steps because every since time I visit any location all the staff are smiling, happy, with perfectly clean and tailored uniforms and most important the food is always on point consistent ....Hands down AMAZING!

Good because it's so convenient; bad because it's so convenient! My week isn't complete without an in-n-out burger. Eeek!   I always go thru the drive-thru. One, because I am lazy. Two, because I can't stand the smell of onions! The entire restaurant reeks of onions as soon as you walk in and the smell stays on ya. No thanks. It's just so much easier to be lazy. Another reason I love the drive thru is because they're so friendly and fast. They ALWAYS greet with something along the lines of \"welcome to in-n-out, how are you doing today?\" Yeah lots of people ask that question but they actually care enough to follow through and give you a real answer and thank you if you ask how they are as well. It's great!",

I actually love Dairy Queen but every time I go there the order is wrong and the employees are not trained well. So I stopped going. But I have never had an issue with in-n-out. The employees repeat their order to you at least 3 times so they haven't made a mistake with my order yet. They seem more positive and upbeat at their jobs. I hear that the pay is decent or at least higher than at other fast food joints, I think that helps employees have pride in their jobs when they feel they are being taken care of. When you feel like you're not compensated properly it reflects in your overall view of your workplace and, unfortunately, that will be passed onto the customers.   People will come back when they have a positive experience and you might lose them for good if they have one bad experience. In-n-out, at least this location, is doing a wonderful job and I will continue to be a loyal customer.",

The gentleman talking our order did not seem to understand our order, givilen that they are specific, but I won't say difficult in the slightest. After been given 3 burgers not a single specifications was correct. On top of that, they have my grandma stale buns. Extremely surprised for In-N-Out, to do that.   To be fair, after taking the food up and speaking to \"the manager\" he did refund my money for the extra Burger and the burger with the stale bread.  But even with that, and explaining the specification to the manager once more. They again got the order wrong and gave us what tasted like old and overcooked fries. Some fries where hard as rocks, not kidding. After frustrations, and waiting for food again, by the time we got all the food, everything was cold and not worth the time or effort we put in to get it, and get it corrected and I don't recall a single apologizes being thrown my way. I felt that the manager was reluctantly accommodating my request rather than believing me.   My gf and I where extremely disappointed, we left without finishing our half decent burgers at best. Unfortunately, for us and In-N-Out, we will not be returning to this specific location.",

This place is always busy no matter what time of day. Crack burgers are good business. Number 1(double double) is my go to when I am extra hungry. Number 2(regular cheeseburger) will do the trick though. Always ask for grilled onions and ketchup. They have great shakes too, vanilla, strawberry or chocolate. I'm not too down for the animal style.. Don't judge..   I am just so glad they have In-N-Out in NV and i don't have to drive to CA to eat it. I may have just not moved here! It's that good!",

People seem to get overly excited about the secret menu, and that's nice and all, but it's nothing new, far from secret, and definitely not a game changer...funny how people love to be in the know of anything that's supposedly \"secret\"..it's not illuminati folks!...lol ..(extra crispy fries, animal style, protein style, etc, etc) yes its good stuff but lets face it, the bragging rights component is far more important (to most people) than anything you'll consume, cause again, it's not overwhelmingly great...it's good though. I just laugh when I witness first hand the smugness and self satisfaction people experience as they share this \"life altering news\" as if they know some secret MI6 agent behind the counter that can \"hook them up, cause they are special\"... like disney dust to a 5 year old..all because they know the secret \"language\" lol..(out of towners that might have In N Out twice a year become cool kids all of a sudden)......Jheer ahsum dewd!  Ok so now that we have that out of the way, I would have given the review 5 stars, since In N Out is one of my top 3 burgers (along with Dicks in Seattle and 5 Guys), however the service at this specific location is so poor I had to average the score.  I've been to this location since they first opened years ago, and this place has really suffered a major decline..  Service here, especially at night, really sucks. They take waaaaaaaaaaay longer than  usual to fulfill your order, the place is never clean, homeless constantly pan handle at this location (they stand right next to the entrance and pan handle) and mgmt does nothing about it. The funny thing is, by comparison, they aren't THAT busy!  Is it because they are under staffed?  Whatever it is, it's VERY noticeable if you've ever eaten at In n Out before.   The pedestrian drive thru order taker is rarely there, and when they are, they can't get  to the entire line since the signal range on their device only goes up to 5 ft from the normal drive through speaker box (so what the F is the point?!?!?) Several times I'll provide my order to this drive thru walker, only to have them say, \"I'm sorry sir but something is wrong with our mobile system, just pull forward and provide them your order\"..an absolute waste of time further delaying the experience.....Other things that have happened here on several occasions: incorrect change given, incorrect order (who the hell messes up a plain cheeseburger?), overcharged, cold and stale fries, rude service, always forgetting items, salt, ketchup, napkins (drive thru), and massive delays...to name a few.  If I were to sum up THIS SPECIFIC In N Out location, it would be to compare it to that of a McDonald's....IN A WALMART!  And If you don't know what I'm talking about, go to any Walmart in Las Vegas, and dine in at the built in McDonalds, they all have them. It's what it sounds like, and what you would expect. Shitty on many levels. Sub Par even for Fast Food Standards...  Bottom Line: Save yourself some trouble and skip this location, head to Five Guys which is just up the road less than 2 mins north on LVB, or if you are set on In N Out, head to the Ft Apache or Tropicana location.",

We have experienced the drive-thru and dine-in options at this location and the service has always been phenomenal. You absolutely feel the enthusiasm everyone has for the place and the product. Everyone is very nice and you always feel welcome! Oh, the food? SO, SO good. I usually order a Double, Single (two patties, one slice of cheese) Protein-Style Burger with onions and fries. It's the perfect burger. The one slice of cheese adds the right balance of flavor without being overwhelming. It also doesn't hurt that this burger is simply $3! The fries are not at the top of my list and I don't care for it separately, but when you eat it with your burger, it's the perfect combination. So when I'm in the mood for a burger without the fuss and wallet-raping, I'm here!",

Probably one of the tasty burgers especially when you add grilled onions. For the bigger order you can order a 3x3 or 4x4 patty. I usually order with no salt on the patty, lettuce tomato, cheese and grill onions only and they do a great job. I also get fries well done not salt and sometimes with cheese and grill onions. Anytime I have a craving its a cheap eat to satisfy the palate. BTW: If you're going to eat bad mine as well go all the way and wash it down with a soda. I can always trust In-n-out to do a great job of filling my order. If you are from the east coast or Midwest, you have to try one of these burgers.",

I do think that INO fries taste like cardboard unless I ask for them cooked light. But that's the beauty of INO, they will undercook your fries if you want. They will overcook your fries if you want. Hell, they'll probably serve them to you in a hair net if you ask nicely.  Great staff, 100% order accuracy on every visit in 3 years. I sometimes whine about the lack of decent restaurant options in the Dead Hooker Burial Ground part of SW Vegas, but really I should just shut up and come here.",

The employees were exceptional for a fast food restaurant but the food came out a little on the slow side considering there weren't many people here yet.  The dining room was clean as was the visible portion of the kitchen.  The bathroom was also very clean and sterile similar to any McDonald's restaurant you visit.  No paper towels for drying hands.  Hand blowers.  The food is good but we're not a fan of the fries.  Five Guys fries are better in our opinion.  The burgers are half the price of Five Guys and almost as good.  Our family of four ate lunch here for half the price of Five Guys.... $15.",

However, last night my brother asked me to pick up some food for him, so I went here. Usually when I pass by, I see a pretty long line of cars in the drive-thru, but last night there were only a few cars in front of me and the line went by VERY quickly. I ordered a number 1: double double animal style, fries, and a Dr. Pepper for my brother and an animal style cheeseburger for myself. The person that gave me my food was pretty funny. I asked him for some ketchup and when I already had the bag in my hand he said, \"Oh, here's some ketchup..SLAM DUNK!\" and he put the ketchup in the bag as if he were really doing a slam dunk. The service itself deserves 4 stars. I was probably In-N-Out within five minutes.  Once I got home, I dug into my cheeseburger. It was mighty orgasmic. Imagine not eating chocolate (if you love chocolate) for a few months, then finally having a delicious chocolate truffle. That's how it was when I bit into the burger.. I've been going around town having all these \"gourmet\" burgers that I almost completely forgot how delicious In-N-Out burgers were. And the fries...oh the fries! So thin and crisp, so perfectly cooked, and soo tasty!  Hands down, 5 stars!",

From walking in and being welcomed, to being served at the counter and seating ourselves to eat, this company definitely has their priorities straight with regards to service and it makes all the difference! The food is also so tasty, although it's important to bare in mind that this is fast food and the food does fall in line with that in terms of quality. I always go for a cheeseburger (protein style). The lettuce is always fresh and crunchy which I love but the way it's put together (condiments etc) is sometimes better than other times. Also, if you are not aware of animal fries (fries with thousand island style dressing, cheese, onion and pickle), where have you been?! Seriously, every time! Come to think of it, I don't think I know that I've ever had the regular fries. I didn't realise until my visit yesterday that you can change how well done the fries are cooked and with the animal fries sauce, I always wanted the fries a little more crunchy so they wouldn't go soggy. In a word.. AMAZING!!! INO is always my go to fast food treat and I doubt that will ever change!",

I have visited In-N-Out a countless number of times, and from that, I cannot think of a single time where I was less than satisfied.   The food is incredible, yet simple. The staff is super friendly. And for how crowded it usually is, In-N-Out delivers their product consistently, and at lightning speed.   A few tips for the newbies:   ~ In-N-Out has a secret menu. Be sure to ask for things like grilled onions, chopped peppers, protein style (no bun, wrapped in lettuce), the 4x4 (4 patties and 4 pieces of cheese), animal fries (fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions), or even a grilled cheese!  ~ In-N-Out's fries usually run on the chewy side. Ask for them well done if you want them nice and crispy; they make them fresh to order!   Overall, you need In-N-Out in your life. This is not a topic for debate. If you read this review, start driving and do yourself the best thing you could do all day.",

    "text": "In-N-Out is notably one of the most famous burger joints on the West coast!   Burgers - They are well-known for a reason! In-N-Out burgers are freshly prepared with 100% pure beef patties that are cooked to order. The patties are well-seasoned and juicy. Toppings include tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and onions. Their special sauce (mayo, mustard-like) is delicious and adds great flavor to the burger. The freshness and quality of their ingredients come across with every bite!  Animal-Style Fries - Another distinguisher of In-N-Out are their \"animal-style\" fries. Their fries include freshly-cut potatoes topped with their secret spread and grilled onions. Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the fries. The spread and grilled onions end up leaving the fries pretty soggy and I personally prefer fries with a super crisp texture.  The employees here are friendly and the restaurant is well-kept and clean. With their fresh ingredients, In-N-Out is definitely one of my favorite burger joints. My only wish would be for them to migrate to the East coast!",

They have tons of workers which is why I feel thier wait really isn't that long. They are all friendly too, so thats a plus especially for a fast food joint. Good service is rare.",

I had the single hamburger and fries. Buttery bun, just greasy enough burger and fries. Great portions. I wish I would have ordered a milkshake to go! Clean, friendly, classic.",

I'm trying to figure out where they get the young ppl that work for these stores from bc they are always super accommodating and polite which I find isn't very common for a fast food joint. We don't make a habit out of Eating here, 2-3 times max a year but when we do it is a treat. Vanilla shakes are amazing, pink lemonade is awesome(pretty tart though) and the classic simpleness of the burger and fries can't be beat!",

And just to prove how good this location is, there is almost always a packed lobby and a drive thru backed up several cars deep through the parking lot.  But the service is prompt, top notch and of course personable.  They have never gotten my order wrong here nor have they ever not greeted me with a friendly smile and hello.  Simply put, they are awesome!!  Keep it up guys!!  Food is excellent.  OG In-N-Out good as I stated above.  And I know OG In-N-Out, I have been getting double-double's from the So Cal restaurants since the early 1980's as a kid.  The founding family would be proud....",

The food is a hit or miss at this location and that's not a good thing. It so isn't that bad. I mean some times it's like OH MY GOD this is why I love In-n-Out and sometimes it's like ummmm, it's just not all that great.   Tonight never the less was a good night. The Resturant is pretty much always busy by the way but food always seem to come out at a decent time. Tonight the buns were toasted perfectly where the edge is buttery and crunchy and the burger is juicy. The fries are the fries but this time it was not too hard and not too soft and with just the right amount of salting.  There was a good size line in the drive thru lane (not too big to where there had to be a live person outside taking curb side orders) but a size. With that said food was fresh and line moved quick. It is also nice that the drive thru is all glass and you can see them cooking inside which is entertaining and makes you forget that you are waiting when you are killing time in line.   Anyhow I haven't yet had a bad experience with service every time have been extremely pleasant but food needs to be consistence.   I give them  2 thumbs up!",

    "text": "You gotta love my early yelp reviews which says nothing but a few words just like my original review for this In-N-Out location which only said \"Its OK.\"  Though I would've loved to kept the review as only \"Its OK\" and possibly seeing my face on sites that diss yelpers I had update my review for F.U.C. sake.  If you 're craving some In-N-Out and don't wanna wait too long at the always crowded Tropicana location definitely hit up this locations.  It is only a few miles south and you're basically In-N-Out as you should.  No 50 or so taxis, limos, or drunks pedestrians in your way. The main reason for the review.  Because this is located in a shopping center there are lots of parking spots to dine in your car, which the Tropicana location lacks when busy.  I'm not a huge fan of In-N-Out but I do occasionally enjoy their burgers which are pretty good for fast food burgers, then again so is Carl's Jr.  I do not eat their fries and think they're terrible.  I am not a fan of \"secret\" menu I'd like to know what my choices are especially from a fast food joint.  People do enjoy ordering from their secret menu so that's cool but because I don't really know what's on secret menu so I can't really increase my rating. Maybe next time I'm there I'll ask the employee to order me a meal of only items from the secret menu.  One of my few words reviews updated now on to the next.",

    "text": "When I yelp, I bark animal style. When I dine in In N Out I pass over animal style and enjoy a mouth watering cheeseburger & fries.    Speaking of animal style, in the fast food jungle, In N Out is an animal with the style of simplicity and efficiency. It is delicious fast food made simple. With the exception of a secret menu, there are only three meals to choose from. A hamburger meal, a cheeseburger meal, or double cheeseburger meal. It is simplicity made fresh. Forget about ordinary burgers being left under warm lights or frozen patties warming up in a microwave style device. At In N Out, they cook the burger right there and in front of the customer.    Delicious fast food made simple is brings me inside the Blue Diamond Road In N Out Burger oftentimes when I am in the vicinity of the Target in the parking lot. Lol. Sometimes I go out of my way to do an errand in this Target just for an excuse to patronize In N Out. The thing is, it seems that on any given visit hundreds of people are also patronizing In N Out. The upshot us that I am rarely in n out. But then again I always dine inside. Regardless that I might be number 240 and they are serving customer 186; efficiency speeds up the wait. Due to supply and demand, In N Out is so popular that finding a table is as difficult as finding a cold day on a June in Las Vegas. Just like at any In N Out; I consider myself satisfied sitting at a bar chair.     On the subject of crowded, I observed that at In N Out; customers rarely seem agitated or annoyed. Ditto for the employees. The employees here are even friendlier than at casual dining restaurants that I have experienced. An example is last Saturday when I dined here, a friendly employee went up to all the customers asking how the food was and making small talk.     In a City where there are countless restaurants to dine in, In N Out is the ultimate option. It is upbeat, inexpensive,  and delicious. When it comes to yelping this In N Out, I give it a 4 star bark :-)",

I always get a 2x1 (two patties with one cheese) animal style with raw onions instead of grilled. It never fails that the cashier always looks at me with a confused expression. When I explain myself, he or she ALWAYS says \"so you want a double double.\" No, I don't want 2 pieces of cheese! That's why I ordered a 2x1.

I've lived all over SoCal, from north of, to the beach cities, to la, and to Vegas- so to say this was the fastest one I've ever been to is saying a lot.   My boyfriend gave me his order (which is relatable to a Starbucks order if you know what I mean) and I gave my complicated order as well and when I got home everything came out perfect! All together I would say it took 5 minutes in the line with the nice gentleman walking to cars to speed up the orders. My only complaint is the fries were a little cold, but they can't get it all right for everyone. I don't eat red meat often, but I do enjoy an in n out burger a couple times a year.

Shake Shack is okay, but it tries to be more of a fancier joint - plus it's pricey! I'm glad In-N-Out embraces its menu, and knows who it is: simple, fast food. Now I know why people speak of its lore, it's so good! It's really a shame that we don't have In-N-Out in FL, it would be my favorite place to get burgers. I loved that all of the ingredients in the burger were fresh, but still easy to hold in my hand. I also enjoyed the the fries tasted like they were cut that day, and didn't have gallons of salt like other fast food fries. Perhaps it's better for my waistline that we don't have an In-N-Out where I live.",

The cleaners and order callers are also happy and smiling. The kitchen is clean and makes me wish my kitchen was that clean. The drinks are all self service with free refills. The ketchup and condiments are self service and the area around there are clean. It's sometimes hard to find a place to eat your meal but they have inside and outside dining area.

It's conveniently located by one of my offices.  It's so close that I could smell the Animal Fries from across the parking lot.  I think that I would be here a lot more, but it's so damn busy.  The drive thru lines are long.  The lines inside is even longer.  A typical order for me is a Double Double (spread only & extra toast), with fries, and an extra Cheeseburger (also with spread only & extra toast).  Lately, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 cheese).  Overall, I can't complain.  The lines may be long, but always worth it.

I didn't really care for the animal style fries because they just put a square piece of American cheese over the fries which didn't really melt all that well, but the animal style burger was yum.

And finding out later all burgers have onions.  I have my colleague call right after to customer care and notified what's wrong and the customer care specialist named (Destiny) tried within her power to accommodate the problem.  But the sad thing is that we had to throw the burgers away and not being reimbursed, it's really alright on our end. But the problem has been recurring and really need to be handled.  The only solution is to call customer care and place the order.   We really love the burgers from in n out and if you are planning to order a big catering, call customer care and ask for (Destiny).

Yup, this place.   Honestly, my order came out fine and in True In-N-Out style the employees were friendly and efficient but this place was packed at 2PM, and seeing all the employees working so hard when I know they should have been past lunch hour was simply impressive.

Originally a CA girl then moved to Chicago..IN-N-OUT is what is missing in my life now!!! :'(   It had been over a year since I had indulged in this glorious burger..but still knew exactly what I wanted w/o even glancing at the menu.   Cheeseburger animal style..no pickles. A side of fries w/ THREE sides of spread. NOM NOM NOM. & yes I used all three sides of spread, initially I thought I only needed 2 and the other one was for the bf, but when I realized he wasn't going to use it I proceeded to slab more spread on my already animal style burger and dipped my fries into it's yummy goodness.  Oh IN-N-OUT...you are truly what a hamburger is all about!",

We rolled up to the window realizing we forgot our debit card at home. The staff member turned and told us to wait. He comes back in notifies us that we cannot get the drinks however they could give the food to us free of charge. I was absolutely stunned and could not believe what I was hearing.  We were given the food as long as we will promise to try to return within the week and pay our bill.  I returned not only paying the bill but wanting to tip out both the manager and staff member that we're so grateful for giving us the food for the night. In and out has always been the best, but this goes over the top and beyond what great service is all about!   Oh you guys are absolutely amazing, we will be back even more and from here on out always with cash in hand lol you're forever loyal customer!",

When I got to the first window the girl said there was no drink ordered and I was like doesn't a drink come with the meal and she said yes but the person who took our order forgot to add the drink. So she proceeded to charge me extra for the drink now since it wasn't the meal deal so it made the price go up but she didn't want to try an understand that so instead of arguing with her I just let it go. Then when I got to the second window they forgot to give us the drink that we were having trouble with at the first window. Smh. I left really irritated.

Because we stopped here for lunch the other day and I was having so many opinions about it.  Positives: Drive thru didn't look like it was miles long, workers we talked to we incredibly courteous and our window gal even counted out 10 ketchups when we told her \"around 10\", also my fries and burger were PERFECT!! The fries were perfectly crispy yet soft on the inside and super fresh with the perfect amount of salt. The burger buns were toasted to perfection. Win!  Negative: the drive thru here is total chaos as there isn't nearly enough space for the line and no signage out for when it gets crazy long like we notice at our CA locations. Also nobody was taking orders outside so the line was moving terribly slow for the most part.  I will be back based on convenience, service, and food being perfect.",

I've eaten inside and went through the drive thru and the staff is always friendly!   Is this your first time? Omg you have to order my favorite, it's a double double, animal style onions and tell them proteins style (no hamburger bun, it's wrapped with lettuce) its to die for! So freakin delicious. If your daring, you can also get your fries animal style. Very tasty!   If you're like me and love the sauce, be sure to ask for more. They have it in packets (no charge) and make sure to order the pink lemonade.   The other great thing about In-N-Out is their prices. It's so freakin cheap compare to other fast food restaurants and the quality of food is on point.   Enjoy!!!! It's worth the visit!",

If you're new to this chain, make sure you try the animal fries. It'll be worth the calories!  I got a to regular cheese burger with grilled onions and chopped pepers (peppers are not that spicy). This chain always toasts the bread to perfection. I took this burger home and was about a 15 minute drive and it was still hot and crunchy!   In and out is not like other fast food burger joints. The taste and recipe have always stayed consistent since I was kid. They also make the burger right when you order it, so if you're dining in, be prepared to wait.   The drive thru line is very efficient and fast.  Don't let the multiple cars fool you! There's always a staff member taking orders from you car that way it makes the lineore faster. There was probably about 8 cars in front of me and we waited about 10 min only. Super quick!  I have yet to try the hot chocolate but I heard it's delicious. YES, HOT CHOCOLATE is supposedly out of this world. BUT I have tried their bomb shakes. Warning:  If you are lactose like me, it's very milky! BUT so worth the restroom trips after. LOL",

He might not be compelling me to eat a 3x3 animal style, but the biblical references on the wrappers and cups are conclusive evidence that he (or she) approves my fast food consumption. When it comes to Vegas locations, the Blue Diamond offers a fantastic experience that is worth whatever time out of the way it might be.   The menu is simple. Its a burger that you come here for and the object of ordering at INO is to order off the \"secret\" menu or to try and stump or surprise the staff with a new concoction. If you think you are up to the challenge, try the 3x3 or the 4x4 which is exactly as it sounds three patties and three slices of cheese or four patties and four slices. Getting anything (except the shakes and your soda) \"animal style\" is clearly a must. Animal style throws on a slice of cheese, a thousand island style spread and onions.  The shakes are creamy and flavorful, don't even hesitate if the thought pops in your head to mix flavors. I personally enjoy the neapolitan. If shakes aren't your thing, be sure to get a icy cold coke, it goes beautifully with the burger and fries and just soothes your soul.  Service is good and the staff are incredibly spot on. The orders came out perfectly despite the complexity and the lines moved at a nice pace while still offering attentive service. It clearly puts its other fast-food counterparts to shame.  I mentioned that it is worth the time out of the way. If you happen to be visiting sin city, the Dean Martin drive location near the strip might be the easiest to get to, but the wait might be a little long for your liking, especially when the pangs of hunger should strike. Head south for about ten minutes and it will be well worth the effort.",

My family and flew to Vegas for my 21st birthday and were excited to see an In N Out, as we dont have one in Seattle. We sat outside and there are pigeons which is totally fine we love animals but what really disgusted me was the teenagers sitting adjacent to us throwing their used sauce packets at the birds, when we spoke up about it to them IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS they ignored us but figured they got the message. After about 10 minutes the parents left the kids and drove off. 5 minutes pass and they do the same thing as last time, this time hitting the bird. We spoke up AGAIN and they started arguing with us about it. So my mom got management to come out and do whatever they had to do, if that meant kicking them out or telling them to stop. Well that didnt go so well. They brought out what looked like their best friend as when he came out they greeted him by first name and gave him pats on the back as he told them quietly to \"chill out\" as soon as he left the kids laughed at us. Right after that they threw ANOTHER sauce packet and after that we didnt say anything, we just went inside and asked for the General Manager or a phone number we can talk to and were told that \"these are just how Las Vegas kids are\" we got outside and another older lady speaking to them telling them about respect for elders and soon after they left. The point is Management did absolutely nothing if the kid that was sent out even was management.  Food was good though.",

Now telling you about it is easier said than if you experienced it yourself. My favorite is the four by four burger. Very simple but delicious to your palate. This place reminds me of growing up in Hawaii with 50's type of flair and the quality of Great food and Shakes will not kill your budget. For easy and quick eats, got to go here.

    "text": "\"Best of the best, sir! With honors!\"  Who's up for some fabulous In N Out? This is a rhetorical question of course! When you seek a burger that does not joke around, we look no further than here.   This morning started out like any other Saturday morning here in fabulous Las Vegas. It is the desert, so even in January the sun shines bright most of the month. After taking my puppies for their morning run it was some special time on the couch relaxing after a long week. Having been craving In N Out for the last two weeks the clouds that rolled in around lunch time inspired me to enjoy something different for lunch. Yes, it's an In N Out Saturday, not like one needs a special occasion to visit here. When we have these celebratory days it's not just for the humans, the puppies get rewarded too with a great mouth watering burger.  Off we go all loaded up with our seat belts on the puppies and I are off to the procure burgers, fries, and shakes for championship Football Saturday. The parking lot is easy to access the In and Out. The drive thru is always a no-no on Saturday since the wait in line is shorter inside the store I have noticed. After a few laps around the parking lot I even get a spot sorta close enough to the door. Look I can even see where I parked. Hello over there puppies Cheyenne will be your car guardian while I go get the goods. The parking lots here at In and Outs are always so clean too. I especially love the red garbage cans and they care about our health here. When you push that garbage can lid open their is nothing sticky on the lid. No one needs the flu, thanks fabulous employees for keeping us healthy.  The line as I pull the second door only has about seven or eight people ahead of me. Both registers are open too! As I stand in line glancing at the menu it's so simplistic and after being a customer for more than a decade here at In and Out it has not changed much. If you seek items off secret menu, either Google it or get close to an employee. Lol, of course! Almost my turn, the smells from the burgers being cooked are intoxicating. Those delicious aromas. Oh my, yes my pretties you are going home with me! Muah!!  Back from my tangent, it's my turn to order. The employee that is taking my order is so amazing and that smile is so genuine. I was thanked for being a guest and now that the social jargon is done let's go. A few double doubles here, cheeseburgers with extra pickle, no onion ever, and some Neapolitan shakes. The employee was so kind to read the order back with that same smile. When I asked for the Neapolitan shake it needs to be the largest since the puppies will have to have some, of course! Are you asking Neapolitan shake? How? It's from the secret menu, yes! Here is a secret revealed from that menu, your welcome!  As I sit and wait for my food, number after number are called for those that got here before me. My delicious time will come, plus it's a big order of at least six burgers deep! The smells from the grill masters tease my sense of sanity as I sit here and wait oh so patiently. Inside I'm screaming hurry, please I'm so hungry and needz my In and Out. Wow, in less than eight minutes I am fed. I made the food for here since the dogs will not wait to eat until we get home. Pulling out their burgers and one for me and Cheyenne to share the rest are bagged up to enjoy couch side. Walking out to the car the dogs can smell their burgers probably as I was walking up. Two beautiful dogs sitting down and wagging those tails get a cheeseburger each. It's time to go home now.   Having enjoyed my trip to the In and Out I close the door of the car and were off. The tunes are filling our ears with Freddie from Queen. The staff is so friendly here. My visit to this store is always delicious and full of adventure. The amazing employee at the register even convinced me to express my love for In and Out with a t-shirt it's the perfect addition to my wardrobe. Another first that In and Out is tackling is a charity of supporting human trafficking. It's not a joke so many victims are trafficked into this country and we would probably never even know. These nameless victims now have a huge problem. In and Out is taking up the fight to save these nameless victims and let the criminals know that we will never let this be swept under the rug. Do your part by donating to the victims that are nameless.",

Fortunately, it moves very quickly. Since there were quite a lot of people there, it took a while to stake some seats.  I ordered the classic double double animal style. Once my order came, it was time to dig in! First bite, the burger was extremely juicy. My parents complimented how they add decent amount of lettuce compared to places like Burger King. While the burger was delicious, the animal style sauce was a bit salty for my taste.  Another thing that my parents noticed was the price. For the freshness of the beef and fries as well as the taste, you can't beat In-N-Out's price on their food. We have Five Guys where I live and one of their burgers costs about double the price. Please come to the east coast In-N-Out!",

We stopped on Blue Diamond and saw about 15+ cars in the drive thru line so parked and ventured inside. Pretty busy as usual but still a few seats left and actually no one in line. We ordered a couple burgers and fries and made one animal style to fill her craving. The burgers came up within 10 minutes (made to order of course) and definitely hit the spot.

Sat down in front of the pickup counter, patiently waited for our number 21 to be called.   So we can see them making all the food and packaging food. They called two other numbers 19 and 20. Then we happily waited, because our number should be next.   Then they put out another order on the counter and call 22, and wow he looks to have ordered the same thing we ordered, hmm. Then they put out 2 more sets of food and call 23. At this point I'm irritated, so I stand up since I'm sitting right in front and let the girl giving out orders that happened to be our cashier know they skipped our number, and she tells me \"oh we call out the orders when it's ready.\" She literally took my order 15 minutes ago, and it was literally a single cheeseburger, fries and a shake, all of which she just gave to the two groups after us.   Disappointed in this bad service, usually they are amazing and I that's one of the reasons I like coming here. Hope this isn't the start of them going downhill. There's nothing worse than feeling discriminated against. Better luck next time I hope.",

I like how the menu is short and straight to the point. Even better that they have a, \"protein style\" that is wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. The burgers are simple/standard unless you get them, \"animal style\". There are only one size of fries but it's a very generous amount.   You have to try In-N-Out at least once!   Tip: If you're not a fan of animal style, get the animal style sauce packs instead. Who doesn't love thousand island dressing on their burgers?",

I don't know if they are under new management and the manager doesn't care about who he is hiring but I am completely turned off. They are rude, they can't take simple order down, and if the succeed at taking it down right then their food prep staff messes it up every single time. I called to complain directly but was transferred to a call center who addressed their horrible service with a \"Dine with Us\"  We used the dine with us and again had a horrible experience. They can't get their orders correct ever. Worst In and Out and I have been to many many of them in this state and every where in California.   I highly recommend yelping and then calling their call center. Let's get the people who shouldn't be employed out of this place.   Don't even get me started on their drive they times 20mins with 3 cars. They should see how stores in Cali handle crowds of people and what seems like on most days never ending line of cars. 20mins is absolutely ridiculous for this location especially when there's only a handful of people inside and about 3-4 cars in the drive-thru.

Also, they are known for their dressing and they're so sweet about giving them to you. It's really just thousand island, but it makes all the difference in your burger and fries.",

Even if ur trying to be healthy I would get protein style which has no buns and is just wrapped in lettuce but still tastes amazing.

I suppose they would have redone the fries for us had we known to ask, but obviously that can't happen at a drive through & who knew until we got home The fries were so salty, it made the hamburger saltier than usual, too Their quality control needs to be improved, I don't want to even contemplate that that's their new standard!",

( no need to visit The heart attack grill)   The animal style: A mustard cooked beef patty with pickles, cheese, spread, and grilled onions mixed on the grill and placed on top of your burger or fries.   The flying  Dutchman: Two beef patties and two slices of cheese  and nothing more.   The veggie burger: you go with your friends and eat waterer they don't want, onions tomatoes pickles or lettuce and is all free.",

Few places can boast that they are able to survive and truly thrive on one core item, but In N Out has really done it. Delicious burgers, amazing fresh-cut fries, and quite honestly the friendliest fast-food staff you'll ever encounter. Highly recommend for a diner on the go.",

First I didn't even know what it was, now I eat here every chance I get. And for good reason. The consistency of the burgers are always spot on, they've really got this assembly line thing down!!! Almost always I order my burger with grilled onions, and I always get animal style on the fries. The fries are cut fresh from huge potatoes, you can watch them smash and string the potatoes right before they throw them in the fryer and serve them to you. The burger always has a little crispiness to the bun and the cheese drips out of the burger as you eat it. MY KIND OF BURGER!!!! Luckily I've always had a fast metabolism and can eat about whatever I want and stay pretty lean and it's a good thing! There's plenty of calories in this meal! Quality of service, friendliness of the cashier, deliciousness consistency of the meal, and reasonableness (is that a word?) of the price will give it a remarkable 5 STARS! Thanks In-N-Out.

This location gets excellent marks for allowing us to walk in 5 minutes prior to close and actually seem happy that we were there.  We had the Double Double and an order of fries. The double double was flavorful without being greasy. The fries were good, obviously very fresh. This place rates pretty high for me among fast food joints, a close second to Wendy's in the flavorful burger department. It actually gets a bump above Wendy's for their fries, since In-N-Out Burger has much better fries.  All in all, a solid choice for fast food with great employees that care.",

You must keep in mind this is a tourist location so it gets extremely busy because this is a very popular stop for people on the East Coast visiting Las Vegas as there is not any In-N-Outs on the East Coast.  There is a drive thru here and you will see many cabs, Uber's, Lyft's and limos here!    The wait is never more then 15 minutes which is very fast considering the lines here!  They also have many workers constantly cleaning up to make this a clean environment to work which is simply amazing since it is so busy knocking out orders non-stop.  I actually heard this is the most profitable and busy locations in the Country!  In the end, everyone does an amazing job here so keep up the great work!",

I got onion on mine which was a little thick and overpowering. The animal fries were stale with slices of cheese on top with grilled onions and thousand island sauce. I didn't feel like they were anything special. But i guess for the price you do get a lot.",

No big deal, it's cold outside and standing on your feet all day can be tough, I get that. However, the cashier named Esmeralda (young white girl), had the worst attitude and far more atrocious customer service skills. I ordered both my burgers and fries animal style, and when Esmeralda gave me my fries they were plain. Again no big deal, mistakes happen. As soon as she handed them to me I said excuse me miss I ordered animal style fries. She ignored me, so again I tried \"excuse me miss.\" Second time she ignores me again, finally on the third try I get a response and she says \"no they were regular fries.\" And I said that's a mistake, I ordered animal style, she then rudely asked for my receipt and looked over it while sniveling like some kind of bridge troll. She said \"yeah they were regular.\" Well okay... that's on you guys for messing up. Then she takes my fries back all heated like I just stepped on her new shoes, and throws them away in a fit of what I imagine to be is sheer teenage angst. She then goes and clearly talks crap with her fellow angst ridden teenage peers, and comes back and says that'll be $6.50. So let me get this straight, you guys mess up, then you have an attitude, and then charge me?! I pay so that I can drive far and fast away from the misery that is your staff, and when she gives me my fries she whispers to another staff member and laughs maniacally indicating that she had clearly messed with my food. Because of this, I threw away the fries I had just wasted an extra $6.50 on and 20 minutes of my life I'll never gain back. While I understand that fast food restaurants are starter jobs, Inn N Out pays their staff highly. This is to encourage a solid talent acquisition which clearly has eluded this location. Work is hard, every job is like that, but that's no excuse to be rude and conniving -- even when you're an immature little girl. Disappointed in my experience, Inn N Out is supposed to hold higher standards for itself. Management needs to do better.",

There isn't too many Burger chains that can live up to the In and Out Standard.  Fresh ingredients and the quality meat make for a great burger.  One my friends on the East Coast envy and wish they had an In and Out in their town.      A Double Double and Animal Style fries are my standard order.  The burger is everything I expect and the fries and unique and tasty.  The Animal Style adding onions, cheese sauce and special sauce make the fries an even tastier treat.  Didn't get a shake this time but they are also made with good ice cream and remind me of the Soda Shops from my early childhood.  Great location and always busy but they move folks through fast.  The service is always good and friendly which is another In and Out motto.",

I ordered the double-double, which is their top of the line burger (why wouldn't I try their best as a first timer?) and I wasn't disappointed.    The wait was a bit longer than your average fast food restaurant but that's because they make each burger fresh.  It arrived neatly wrapped and ready to eat with a side of freshly cut fries.  The bun wasn't soggy at all and every bite was as fresh as the last.  Could've been one of the best burgers I'd ever had.  I also ordered a vanilla milkshake which was SUPER thick and tasty.  I love milkshakes but hate how they can melt before you're done.  Not this one.  They're practically serving you soft-serve in a cup and straw.    The customer service was unusually excellent for a fast food place.  Sure, they are trying to resemble a 50's burger joint.  Hence, the limited menu (i.e. no swiss mushroom angus burger with jalapenos etc, no kids meals and toys, etc) and something that most fast food places have neglected.....something called customer service.  Both of the gentlemen working the floor were very kind and came over to our table multiple times to see how things were.  Very unusual for a fast food place but very welcomed!  My only gripe is that they are not open late night.  We returned from the casinos around 1:30am and they were already closed and I was really craving a good burger!",

Good thing the quality of their burgers hasn't changed much. By my past reviews you know I don't scrimp on calories (if you are going to eat out...eat out) and In-N-Out is NO exception.   For those of you coming in from anywhere but CA, AZ and NV (maybe they are in Utah and Oregon now...I don't know)...you are in for a real treat. The menu is simple and ordering is as easy as 1, 2, 3 (i'm not just saying that #1 combo is a double double, fries and a drink, #2 is a cheeseburger, fries and a drink and #3 is a hamburger, fries and a drink). However...there are ways to keep your burgers not boring...you guessed it...i'm talking about ANIMAL STYLE (roughly translated...extra sauce, extra cheese and extra grilled onions). My favorite meal (and probably one I would pick before I go and meet the Lord someday many moons from now) is a #1 animal style, well done fries (takes a bit longer but well worth the wait), rootbeer and if i'm feeling saucy (which is pretty common) I go for the vanilla milkshake.   This is a great place for your anklebiters too! They give the kids free stickers at the cashier and they will slice up a burger so they can share (just say you want a kids hamburger or cheeseburger cut up). Will always come to In-N-Out because its tasty, cheap and its just what I do.",

I don't know what's happened at this chain in last few stores, but they cannot seem to get fries right with any consistency. I like golden brown crunchy fries.",
