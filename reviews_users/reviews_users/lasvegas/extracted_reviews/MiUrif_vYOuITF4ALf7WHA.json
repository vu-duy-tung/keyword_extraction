    "text": "Sorry, super late on this review as I am as newer yelper.    My wedding reception was held here in Sept 2011 following my wedding ceremony at the Flamingo.   Upon initial booking, there were several locations in the restaurant to hold our venue depending on party size.   My party was about 30 people so we were going to be held in the semi-private room, which I was ok with.    I wasnt too picky.   I saw in the pictures this one room that had a zebra print floor which I thought was so cool, considering our colors were black and white with red flowers.     When we arrived, we were instantly walked upstairs to the fully private room WITH THE ZEBRA FLOOR.   That totally made my night.    The food was delish, no complaints there.    The two girls who were our servers were THE BOMB.   My mother even made a comment to them about how great they were.    We had at a fast pace gotten through our open bar amount so they were kind as to inform me and see if I wanted to end it there or expand it a little bit.     Now, onto their \"gourmet wedding cake.\"   No joke, simply amazing.    My uncle (whom owns 2 candy shops in Joliet, IL) to THIS DAY still talks about this cake everytime he sees me.    We will be at other family weddings and he still brings up this cake, HA!     The only hiccup throughout the night (which I really wouldnt even call it that much of a hiccup) was that the DJ had put a nice message on the big screen for the whole restaurant to see that said \"Congratulations Stephanie and Michael\" but my hubbys name is Peter.   We, along with our guests, actually were just cracking up about it and of course was the joke of the rest of the weekend.    The DJ immediatly came upstairs to apologize but we didnt care.   It was funny :)",

    "text": "After reading some of the reviews before dining at Planet Hollywood, I was incredibly skeptical. To my utter surprise, the customer service was EXCELLENT. Archie, our server, was genuine and helpful and overall gave us a lasting positive impression of the restaurant.   Now, being from Hawaii, food prices are already ridiculous. We expected high tourist prices...mediocre size and taste. Were we WRONG. The food was amazing. We ordered and shared four appetizers between three adults and three children- the calamari was excellent as were the crispy chicken fingers which were very moist. The chicken lettuce wraps were ok, but I think PF Chang's tastes better.  The rib eye entree was $24 and the steak was very, very large and cooked well. The chicken and broccoli pasta and friend lasagna was excellent. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the entrees we received in the slightest. We even had to take half of our entrees to go because the appetizers filled our bellies.  We didn't mind paying the 17% gratuity and we were so happy with our service that we just had to give Archie additional tip. Excellent dining experience which I recommend to anyone in Las Vegas.",

My friend and I were both wearing skirts and were trying to sit in these chairs comfortably when the table wasn't even over our lap. It was awkward and uncomfortable so we asked if we could move.  In our somewhat better chairs we ordered the nachos and the chicken mac and cheese to share. The nacho were really good and it was a good amount. The chicken on the mac and cheese was meh. Most of the cheese sauce was in the bottom of the bowl and the noodles weren't as cheesy as I hoped. We ended up looking around the rest of the restaurant which was pretty cool, but I probably wouldn't go back as it wasn't noteworthy.",

The only reason we went to this place was because of the $10 coupon, that seems to have suckered lots of people in.  1. Sat down, ordered water with lemons, Didnt get the lemons until after we had started eating and drank all the water  2. Waited nearly an hour to get our food ( you dont do that to hung-over people in Vegas) 3. Three out of 5 orders were wrong (I was the only on brave enough to send mine back) 4. Everything was over cooked (Dont order well done here) 5.  Had to flag down someone elses waitier because ours dissappeared 6. Well done = Burnt 7.  Food was just bad, our table alone went through a whole bottle of ketchup just to be able to digest it.  When the manager came over hear our complaints he knocks the water all over the table (lol).  But then never brought more.  When your putting that much ketchup on your food you need plenty of water.  The only positive was that they bring you the check in 2mins flat at least, and to their credit they did give us a discount, but   Most ppl can forgive bad service with great food, or tolerate bad food with good service but certainly not both.",

Our room in Caesar's Palace was not available for check in at the time, so we decided to venture into the Forum Shops for breakfast.  It turned out that Planet Hollywood was really our only option, so we surrendered our stomachs to the touristy chain.  The restaurant was decked out in all of its traditional Hollywood paraphernalia, but was spacious and well-maintained.  The breakfast menu was surprisingly well-stocked with the basics, so it was just what we needed.  My Vegetable Omelet was delicious, as was the hearty toast that accompanied it.  The side of potatoes were also flavorful, but rather greasy.  The coffee and service were both decent, but nothing memorable.  All in all, our breakfast experience at Planet Hollywood was perfectly fine, though that was much more than I had initially expected!",

I ordered the Blackened Chicken Pasta and it was creamy, it was spicy, it was delicious. The boyfriend ordered the LA Lasagne, it was huge! I don't know how they fill those noodles then deep fry it, but the lasagne was good. Our hostess ended up being out waitress, and she was friendly, made good conversation. The decor and place settings had Hollywood celebrity photos and quizzes to keep your minds busy over dinner, it was fun. I would recommend this place to anyone who has never been to Hollywood and wants to escape to the cheesy touristy glamour of celebrities.",

The movie stuff was the highlight of the restaurant before. There is very lute and it is not very exciting at all. They tried to class the place up too much. Looks like a longe now. As far as the food goes, they still have the signature chicken crunch and it is still as tasty as ever. A little pricey for 4 strips but I guess that's to be expected in a strip restaurant. The service left very little to be desired. Our server Anton had a pleasant attitude but asked if we needed a drink refill. It took ten minutes to get the refill. It wasn't very busy at all. Will I come back? Yes but only because I love the chicken crunch.  Side Note: they played house music the whole time. I like when they played movie soundtracks. It fit the whole idea of Hollywood.",

I asked to pay for an upgrade at which point they have a free upgrade. The upgrade was better size wise but I felt the same way about the cleanliness of room..,I didn't even want to get into shower without shower shoes because the tile looked very \"public\". Again I'm use to a different class of rooms but it's Vegas....nothing should feel short of luxury. I the brighter side planet Hollywood has amazing bars and lounges for the young and older crowd.",

I planned my luncheon for my wedding here and the guest list changed several times and they were so amazing the last minute extra people were coming and instead of charging me upfront for the extras they set extra places and waited to see how many people actually came.  The food was really good and because I had 30 plus coming to my luncheon they allowed my guests to choose from am entire menu instead of just a couple choices. Also another added touch, the menu was personalized to my husband and I.   The service was amazing they made sure that the luncheon went exactly how it was planned. They made sure when our best man wanted to make a speech that the quieted the sound, they let us decide when the toast would be made and when we wanted to cut the cake they had a photographer take pictures and they were so cute!",

This is a fun little place you stop when you just want something simple and easy.  It has all its movie and music memorabilia on the walls and TVs blasting teen pop and Hollywood interviews.  The inside is all pink and purple and sort of is a feast or assault on your eyes depending on how you see it.    We came here because it was close to where we were shopping and it worked!  We had wings, beers, a burger and some pasta.  All were pretty good.  Although my Cajun pasta was really greasy (and I am not sure why).    I thought our server was friendly and attentive and the prices were Vegas resort prices (so they sucked).  I thought it was perfectly a-ok!",

The server acted like he was doing us a favor by taking our orders. 40 minutes to get a check and then it wasn't divided like we asked before he started taking any orders. My soda was empty more than it was full. 3 times in a row the server told me he was bringing me a drink and showed back up at the table with out it.   Just to be clear the restaurant was less than 1/2 full so they were not busy the staff just didn't seem to care.",

We got got there at 10:30 am and there was barely anyone there, yet our food took 45 minutes to arrive. We saw a ton of employees working here, standing around, talking, etc. the entire time.  Seriously, what are you people doing? When the food arrived, oatmeal was cold and I couldn't get 1 refill of coffee because apparently my waitress forgot. We waited another 20 min for her to come back so we could ask for the check. Then she was rude and gave me an attitude because the Vegas pass we picked up there less than 24 hours before was programmed incorrectly by their staff and had to issue us brand new cards. By this time, the rest of my party was already waiting outside. I haven't experienced service this bad in a long time, will not be back.",

It was so long ago that i did not remember if i like it or not. So with that and the free voucher and plus as hungry as we were he hit this place up.  I'm glad we didn't have to pay. Don't get me wrong our food was actually good but damn the prices just kill you. I don't understand with food being so cheap in LV how could this place charge what they do. And to my surprise the place is packed.  My hamburger was huge and left me well satisfied, so much i headed back to the hotel room for a nap after my meal due to how full i felt. The GF had some chicken pasta which was really flavorful and a well sized portion. For deseart we split a strawberry shortcake which was great way to finish the meal.  The service was very good. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive. Looking at the all the Hollywood memorabilia and trying to remember which movie/show it belonged to was fun.  Overall the experience with this place was good. But it does not justify the prices they charge. The food is comparable to any other other good chain restaurant, but $13 for a cheeseburger and fries is just to much. therefore the -1 star is for pricing vs quality.",

Going there for breakfast was a bad idea b/c the Planet Hollywood cafe was the only thing open.   #1 Annoying thing about eating here for breakfast was there was only 6 tables open. Okay, you are the only place open for breakfast and you only have 6 tables open??? I really shouldn't complain b/c we only waited about 20 min.  Anyways onto the food....   I ordered the French toast. I don't know if its b/c I've been on a diet that limits the amount of carbs I eat or it was just really good french toast but I finished it all. It was really good, light and YUM DELICIOUS... I tried everything else and it was just so-so. The food here isn't the most exciting but not bad. If your in the Caesar mall during breakfast try it out....oh yeah, its your only option. haha",

It was cool to admire some of the props that were here and to guess what movies they came from. The bar had some tv so we could watch sports or whatever was playing. I could come back and just chill here.  Great place to meet others as we did and have a small chit chat session.",

    "text": "This place gets 3 stars solely for their bread pudding.  You should know better than to go here for the food.  I was never a fan of traditional bread pudding, the kind with raisins, but a long time ago when they had a location in downtown San Francisco I tried their white chocolate take on the dessert and fell in love.  That location closed in 2001 and I thought it was the last time I would have bread pudding that good.  Then a few years later at the Nordstrom Cafe in SF, I noticed the menu had a \"white chocolate bread pudding.\"  Could it be?  The same as Planet Hollywood's?  I had to order it and, to my satisfaction, it was almost an exact replication of PH's, sans the bourbon sauce.  And I've been eating there regularly ever since.    So on a recent business trip to LV, I passed a PH at the Forum Shops inside Ceasar's while looking for an ATM.  I was hungry from an 8-hour day at a convention and was curious how the bread pudding would compare to Nordstrom's after all these years.  The salmon with mango salsa was nasty - they even fucked up the rice (how is that possible).  But the main attraction was the bread pudding.  They brought it out, it looked the same as before, white chocolate drizzled on top, bourbon sauce on the side as I requested (I remember it tasting way strong).  I bit in and said \"holy shit.\"  It tasted the same as before and better than Nordstrom's - more moist as opposed to a drier, lightly crispy crust.  Bourbon sauce was still strong.  For drinking purposes it's fine but in food I like the alcohol fully cooked away.    These days most Planet Hollywood's have closed so it's a shame that it takes a Vegas trip to feed my BP fix.  But with our conventions every Feb and August, I'm guaranteed to eat it at least twice a year.",

    "text": "In Planet Hollywood Restaurant's defense, I did not get to actually experience the restaurant.  It was more of my experience at the bar.  I stopped in trying to kill some time.  The atmosphere was definitely different in comparison to any bar I've been to.  Tons of celebrity memorabilia throughout.  From where I was sitting, I could see a statue or Stallone as Rocky next to a framed pair of boxing shorts that was actually worn by Stallone in the movie.  Behind me, I'm not sure but it looked like an Alien from the movie Alien.  I ordered a Blue Moon, which was served with 2 slices of orange (I think this is the only time I've gotten it with 2 slices... I'm just saying).  I was watching the NFL game, but from where I was sitting the Philips Flatscreens were both faced at an angle and I was sitting dead-center.  At least there was no glare on the TV so I could actually watch the game.  Behind me was a tremendous projector screen with the same game on.  That tv was epic in size, but suffering in quality.  I also noticed another TV playing in the corner (much smaller) and it was the video that corresponded to the songs playing throughout the restaurant.  Based on just sitting in the bar, I can tell you that the prices are a bit on the expensive side: nearly $15 for a burger named after a celebrity or movie.  I was very close to ordering  their famous Captain Crunch Chicken Strips (I think that was the name) for $10, but decided I wouldn't have enough time to enjoy it.  Anyhow, Blue Moon was on point and the service was decent.  I definitely gotta come back one of these days to actually review the restaurant all-together.  Stay tuned for a full review.  Pros:  * service was decent.  I was acknowledged immediately.  * bartender remembered the faces of people that frequent.  total plus!  *  They had Blue Moon and Fat Tire on tap.  2 of my favs!  Cons:  * a bit pricey  * took awhile to get the bill   Overall:   I didn't have the opportunity to review this place in its entirety.  I definitely will have to come back and try the restaurant.  As for the bar.. 3 stars.  It was A-Ok.",

The restaurant is located inside the Forum shops in Caesar's Palace hotel.  The food is your average American food with average prices. The service we received was pretty good though. She was really friendly, outgoing, and funny at times. The only thing we had to complain about was the fact it was quite dim and the dim lighting kind of made us sleepy or hurt our eyes trying to see our foods.  I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and it was a good size. I almost finished it. It was also pretty tasty. Everyone else ordered burgers and other sandwhiches that looked decent too. Again, there's nothing super special about their foods. But it isn't that bad and there is a lot to choose from.",

Ok so we got everything 50% off because we purchased show tickets at a discount place and they offered 50% off the entrees for like an extra $3. So we figure why not. Boyfriend ordered the salmon with rice and green beans. Too much garlic on the green beans according to him. I got the pomodoro which is just spaghetti with sauce from a can, not so fresh basil, and parmasean cheese. Good thing I chose that because you can't mess that up too much. The boyfriend got violently ill because he got food poisoning. Really not super cool to be violently ill while in the hot land of Vegas. I also got a drink that was ok. I can make it for like $2 rather than pay $12. Don't come here. Go somewhere cheaper and better!",

As someone in the service industry, I might try a little harder (or at all?) to make a person's special day special.  Or at least to not ruin it.  This apparently completely missed the PH staff, who delivered the same lackluster (at best) service that they provide every other paying customer (who needs them, right?).  The wait was atrocious (seriously- for a tip, I almost felt like writing \"You owe me 2 hours of my 30th birthday back), the drinks stayed empty (after they finally showed up, that is), and most of the food, once it did arrive, was wrong.  1/4 got his food correct, 2/4 got her vegetarian dish with meat, 3/4 (that would be me) got my salad with the wrong dressing, even though the waitress wrote down my request, and when I got the new salad, it wasn't tossed.  When I pointed this out, the waitress told me with quite a bit of attitude, \"You asked for it dry.\"  Um, no I didn't, I just asked for bleu cheese instead of shitty thousand island on a COBB salad (oh wait, it's not a cobb because even though it was like $15, there was no avocado!).  Anyway, 4/4 didn't even receive his burrito until like 7 minutes later.  Really.  The food was actually pretty tasty, which was the only redeeming point of the entire experience.  Paying was another hour of my life lost, as the waitress didn't ring our payment correctly and then had to find a manager to reverse the charge on my credit card.  I seriously considered just leaving the card and deactivating it (I have another).  She came out just before we completely left in anger.  It really did take over 2 hours to have lunch for 4 people.  It really wasn't worth the time it stole from my life.  The next day, we forfeited the $10 PH credit on our passes.  No tip was left by anyone in our party.  As far as I'm concerned, they're lucky we paid at all.  Don't waste your precious vacation time.  On a side note: the bathroom also sucks.  Two stalls?  Really??",

We wanted some cheap appetizers and when we were all set to order our goodies, our manlywoman waitress informed us that the half-price deal was for 2 of the most un-appetizing items. So, whatever, we ended up ordering what we originally wanted (knowing full well the bill would suck at the end of it all).  Luckily I had a decent $2.50 pint of Summer Ale and my friend had a good cocktail. On the other hand, our 2 appetizers and burger sucked ass. Oh and my friend also repeatedly asked for lemons in her water, only to never gotten a single one the entire time.  The only time we saw our waitress was when she served us our drinks (she didn't actually deliver the food). She never came by to see how we were doing nor came by to ask if we were done (we'd been sitting there doing nothing for awhile after we finished eating).  So, as tempted as I was to leave no tip at all, I begrudingly gave her a \"f**k you\" dollar (which I would've much rather have used on a cocktail waitress!)  Planet Hollywood...I always knew it sucked, I'd been to others. But damnit, fell prey to them again. Shame on me! ========== Update: If I could remove a star, I would. When I got back from my vacay, I noticed that they'd charged me for a cocktail that we most definitely did not order. Luckily, Amex rocks and did a small charge back in no time flat.",

Nice girl, then waitress disappeared. Told the hostess to find her too adjust the bill and wife still gave her a $3 tip which I felt was too much for no service.  Food was oily and soggy.  This place doesn't deserve even one star.  Guess with only tourist as customers they don't need to have good service, since we will never go back anyway.   I highly don't recommend this tourist trap.

We got the Texmex roll ups and found they were tasteless and had the consistency of cat food. The macaroni and cheese was more like macaroni soup.

We ordered appetizers, which came out with our main meals... ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, that came out COLD... we couldn't even half way eat it because it was COLD... sadly we are afraid of people spitting in our food, so rather not complain and wait another 50 mins to get a dish that we won't eat.  The potato skins were dry, old, over cooked, and too firm...   Kids pizza tasted or smelt like it was sitting by a Clorox rag...   Chicken fingers... \"the fries are good\" frozen fries are always good.  Overall service was 0 food was 1... since the other food was alright...  Even drinks took 20 mins to come out...

My son had to wait at least 40 minutes for food in an empty restaurant.    When we finally got our food, it was all very good. Cooked well, good flavor, generous portions.

Plus most of the (young) staff is usually more interested in talking to each other about what they are going to do that night than checking on their customers. With that being said I came here to pick up our Vegas Power Passes and decided reluctantly to stay and take advantage of the $10 per person credit. I got the asian chicken salad which to my surprise I really liked. The kids got burgers & fries. One got the steak burger and the other a cheese burger. They both weren't too thrilled with their meals. Wifey had a salad too which she was content with. When all was said and done I had to pay about $30 more (in addition to the $40 credit) for our meal which just reminded me why I don't like eating and places like this. 3 Stars for the Asian Chicken Salad.",

He told us that \"oh i thought you were done with them. My bad.\"  We could have asked for the manager, but we thought today is Labor Day so we didn't want him to get in trouble.

So, we ended up here because the place was not crowded. It's located in the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops in the area where the more upscale, designer stores are located.  I had the Kobe beef sliders, $16.  The meat was good but the bread was not good, 3 small squares, like those Hawaiian sweet rolls.   Hubby's steak was great 'tho.  I was pretty surprised that his ribeye steak, $22.99 had a nice charcoal flavor to it.  We found a $10 off coupon if you spend $30 in one of the tourist books you can get at your hotel, which helped offset the cost. I really do not like the chairs at the front of the hotel.  We've been to his restaurant 2-3 times over the years and those large lounge chairs are better suited at a nightclub. You can't move them out of the way and you feel as if you're sitting really low which makes for uncomfortable dining.",

Where THAT PH was a wonderful, immersive experience with thousands of amazing Hollywood memorabilia and movie props on display, this one was a sad, faint copy. I'll estimate less than 1/100th of the props are here, compared to the old one at MOA. And oddly, there is a PH Hotel and Casino but this restaurant is in Caesar's at the end of the Forum Shops.   We arrived during Happy Hour and just wanted appetizers, so we sat at the bar. The barstools are really uncomfortable but the overworked bartender was really nice. The small restaurant was busy with a 20-30 minute wait, so a lot of people decided to sit in the bar, creating a logjam for the poor bartender. She kept up as well as she could, but a ten-minute wait for drinks and twenty minutes for food was pretty standard that day.  We shared the Pot Stickers, which were meaty and crisp; the Buffalo Wings which are described as spicy and are not; and the Chicken Crunch, chicken strips that were fried to death leaving the meat dry and the coating hard. Overall an uneven food experience for $90 at happy hour prices.",

The bartender was extremely helpful in taking our order and making sure our drinks and ice-cream were securely packaged for take out. Another PH team member got us a box to carry our food. Everyone was polite and helpful. It was just a really positive experience. ....and the burgers were excellent!!",

The real problem I had is this... during dinner the cheese from the nachos got on my watch so I took it off and cleaned it and placed it on the seat next to my bag, the watch must have fallen on the floor and I left without it! We called the restaraunt and the person who answered argued with us that she couldn't go check for the watch because another guest is sitting at the table. After some convincing the woman put us on hold stating she will look, she said she couldn't find it so I asked her to please check once more, she again said she doesnt see it. I took and Uber back and was greeting by the lady from the phone who stated I can sit at the bar and wait for the guest to finish. When they got up I walked over and before even reaching the booth I could see my watch on the floor right next to the table. She didn't even look! The thing that upset me most was that she didn't even offer to take my phone number and return my call if the watch was found.",

I am disappointed and believe me a meal at one of those inexpensive fast food restaurants taste much better.  The customer service had no experience and were to slow. I couldn't enjoy my fajita because it didn't taste and they brought me only 3 small tortilla breads and when I asked for more it took them 30min.

    "text": "*sigh* Considering its a wedding party, you would expect the OVERALL service be up to par- sadly, it wasn't. My girlfriend had her reception here which is inside Caesar's Palace Hotel. We were a little late from our 8:30pm reservations (due to the wedding starting late & the limo arriving late to pick us up) but I didn't think that was a big issue. On our way to be seated, the lady must've been new because instead of walking us to our table, she walked us to the women's bathroom LOL who does that?? We ended up figuring out where our table was and sat ourselves. About 15min later someone came and took our drink orders. Majority of the table ordered water, lemonade or tea. 30 minutes later they finally brought the drinks and someone took our food orders. By this time, its almost 10pm and our stomachs are literally about to fall out from starvation. They bring a few baskets of bread as an appetizer. There was a menu designated by the bride and groom so we each chose one of the menu items: steak and shrimp, grilled chicken or salmon. Each came with potatoes and veggies. Once they finally started bringing plates, we noticed everyone at the table wasn't served. It was starting to get frustrating. We informed the manager and he offered the one's who hadn't received meals a complimentary alcoholic beverage which was very nice.   The food was good but lacked a significant amount of flavor in each meat. The place wasn't overly packed so I'm unsure why the service was so slow and the servers should learn time management. While waiting for over 45 minutes for food, that would be a good time to bring out condiments, refill drinks and ensure everyone has what they need. This wasn't done. We got the condiments ourselves and had to ask for refills. We had cake but the server also should be taught on how to cut a wedding cake. You cut the bottom first and let the bride/groom take the top portion home.. It was all backwards. Nonetheless, it was a good taste just odd considering this isn't their first time accommodating a wedding party. If considering coming here for a reception, please ensure all your ducks are in a row prior to arrival.",

Don't expect more than bar food and fun drinks and you'll be fine, don't expect more than \"tourist service\" when they know you won't come back and you'll enjoy it.

    "text": "NEVER HAVE ANY SPECIAL EVENT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My husband and I had our wedding reception here and it was the biggest mistake ever. Seriously 3 days before the wedding I relieved a call by Melodee (their special events coordinator) and she told me that since I had a guest list of 50 people they wanted to move me out of their private room. She said that even tho the room has the capacity to fit that many people they still dont like to do it because it gets too crowded for the servers. She assured me I was going to be in a really nice area of the restaurant that is semi private. She said even tho its not completely private that it would feel that way because its in the back of the restaurant out of the way and they'd would even have the balconies open for us. Complete LIE! Out of the restaurant my ass. The restrooms were located back there! And we were just mixed in with other tables that had random people eating. Nothing about it was private or separate. The whole time I had strangers walking in and out of my reception. Oh and the balconies weren't even open for us, instead they were filled with people out there smoking cigarettes and eating dinner!  My husband had to ask 3 times just to get his glass of champagne. He finally went and stood up by the bar just to finally get served. For the groom to have to do that to get a drink at his own reception is just preposterous! Oh and then they served me the wrong meal. Then they lost our special toasting glasses we provided. Then our cake topper fell over in our cake and got all ruined. I also paid so I could have salad options for my guests but then they just brought everyone out the same salad. There was no option. Some of our guests ordered separate alcoholic beverages and they never even brought out the tabs. My mother in law asked for her drink tab and sat there and waited for 15 min even after everyone had left and nobody ever brought her tab or anyone else there tab.  We were told at the restaurant that they were going to refund us $788 for the disappointing experience and for the guests that didn't show up. When we got back home I called to check up on everything and to get a receipt for all the charges. They then tried telling us that they were only going to refund us $300 for the champagne toast and that we also owed $90 for the guests that didn't pay for their alcohol.  I expressed to them that we were told $788 and that no one ever brought any tabs out so we weren't paying that. They finally said ok and agreed to do what they originally promised. I asked Melodee to send me a copy of all the charges so I could confirm it was all correct. She never responded. I emailed a second time asking again for the break down of charges. Again, she never responds. My husband calls and asks for a call back to discuss, they never call back. Finally I email them and say that if they dont respond that I'm disputing all charges made by planet hollywood to my credit card. FINALLY they email me back. She said it was taking so long because she wanted to make sure the accountant had everything correct. How does it take 10 days to figure all that out? And you cant even email me back and say that the first two times??!! We also left our cake topper there and some other items which they said was fine and they would mail them to us. Almost 3 weeks later and nothing. I again have to call them to check on our items. They say \"oh ya its sitting right here on my desk I just didn't have your address\" I ask, \"why dont you just call and ask then? How do I know you dont have our address??\"  I strongly advise that no one ever has their wedding reception here or even eat dinner here. These people are liars.",

Husband and I were not too hungry so we decided to share a burger. Usually don't say too negative of things about a restaurant, but I could have gone to Carl's Jr. or Wendy's and gotten the same thing. It was a pretty plain cheeseburger that definitely was not worth the $13.99 we had to pay for it. The fries tasted like Burger King's. Husband's ice tea was $3.99!!!! I understand it's Las Vegas but other restaurant charged $2.99, $2.59....$3.99 seems a little steep! I would have gotten a soda but didn't want to pay $4 for it.  Didn't try anything else on the menu but if their quality of cheeseburger is the quality of their other items, not worth it!   We will not be going back there on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

First, there were three different parties waiting around noon on a not very busy Thursday.  It was almost ten minutes before the hostess showed up.  I only wanted an appetizer and ordered potato skins.  After waiting almost 30 minutes, what I got was half done potato wedges, with about a tablespoon of sour cream, almost no bacon or chives, and very little cheese.  I asked the waitress for ketchup, and she promptly took an order for customers across the waiting room.  After almost ten  minutes, I finally got the ketchup, about a tablespoon.  After I had almost finished my \"meal\", she finally asked if I wanted a drink refill which I got it over 5 min later.  Interestingly she said there was \"something going on in the kitchen\".  Everyone has a bad day, but managers need to realize that one experience like this can translate into many lost customers.  Again, I would return again at some point, but there is never any excuse for food or service like this no matter how bad a day the kitchen is having.  Obviously the manager was asleep at the wheel this lunch hour.",

    "text": "First of all, I think people are making a mistake and reviewing the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino on this page. This page is for the RESTAURANT, which is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's. Read the damn address if you don't believe me.  I first ate in Planet Hollywood when I was either 12 or 13 years old. The Forum Shops had just opened (this is back when they had some GOOD stores/attractions!) and we stopped in here for lunch. Getting to this place is not easy (having to park in a garage, walk through a casino and hallways, etc.) but is worth it.   For the unfamiliar, Planet Hollywood is to the entertainment industry what the Hard Rock Cafe is to music. The restaurant has a ton of movie props and the like on display. Some highlights featured on display here include a miniature used in Top Gun, a Space Shuttle model used in Moonraker, a rifle from Starship Troopers, and even a chariot wheel from Ben-Hur. Any fan of the movie industry will get a kick out of this place.  But the biggest surprise - there is MORE to this place than just the movie stuff! The food here is surprisingly good. My choice item is the Spaghetti Pomodoro, which amazingly, is actually one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. The rest of the menu has a good assortment of items, as well. Quite honestly, I don't think I have ever come in here and been disappointed food-wise. Guess some of the disappointed reviewers came on a bad day.   My big complaint is that this place NEVER updates their props. It's the same stuff every time. This is cool stuff, but how hard would it be to put up a few new props every few months? Also, the memorabilia for sale in the gift shop tends to be a bit overpriced. I wish they would movie this place to the Planet Hollywood hotel/casino; that place is a lot more convenient and easy to get around in.  Still, with food this good, it's hard to fault the place. Be you a tourist or local, this is one place worth checking out.",

I'm sad to say that the decor doesn't appear to have changed at all since my initial visit... which is downright pathetic since the restaurant was butt-ugly back in 2001 and looks even worse now.  The entire back wall of the restaurant looks like... like... The 80's.  I know that's a very vague description but there's no other accurate way to say it.  It's as if the Planet Hollywood designers took every tacky design principal from the 80's and applied it to a Hollywood mural of famous faces and classic movie moments.  Trust me, you'll understand if you ever see it.  But hopefully you won't.  And not to go off on a tangent, but if you're creating a mural with pictures of Hollywood megastars, why the hell is there a picture of Tom Arnold?!?  I had a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a few chicken tenders that were apparently coated with Captain Crunch.  The food okay but in no way memorable.  If you've ever wondered whether a meal would taste better if you were sitting ten feet away from a rifle used in \"Starship Troopers,\" the answer is no.",

We would have said something, but our waitress didn't come back until after we were finished eating. It took another 10 minutes to get our change back after getting the bill, making our sitting at this sorry excuse for a dining establishment about 1.5hours.

The hostess told us they were getting our table ready so we waited patiently. 30 minutes later she came to get us and lead us to our table. We walked by several large tables that would have been fine to sit at. We walked past all of those, and into the patio. Went all the way to the end of the patio and to the left where there was nothing around us. We asked why we couldn't sit at one of the tables inside and the hostess response was \"those tables aren't ready yet\" we said we would wait and she gave the same exact response. She walked away and we all looked at each other in disbelief. We have never been so blatantly discriminated against. My husband is black and I am white. We have 4 children, my mother in law, brother in law and my daughter's friend made up our party. We walked out angered that this happened to our family. We will never go back there! We took ourselves and our family to the cheesecake factory and enjoyed a wonderful, delicious meal without being discriminated against.",

I just wrote a review for Delmonico, which is a fine establishment. And now, I will write about the most horrendous establishment that is Planet Hollywood Las Vegas.   First of all, it's located in the Forum Shops at Caear's Palace, home of my favorite stores - Louis, Gucci & Tiffany. But now I find that it's home of the WORST and overpriced \"restaurant\" I've ever eaten at!  Perhaps I, like other Yelpers, can be gracious and give this place 2 stars, only because the service wasn't horrible. The food, atmosphere and presentation are another story!  I ordered a Strawberry Margarita. It took something like forever and a day for it to come to the table. It was surprising, since I don't remember taking Margarita mix and ice, putting it in a blender and pouring it in a glass could take so long!!! Perhaps it was my lapse in judgment to think that I could get anything close to a decent margarita at this joint.   For lunch, I ordered some kind of chicken sandwich with avocado and a side of fries. All that was on my plate was the chicken sandwich and a little cup of fries. That's it. Not even a little bit of garnish. Even Dave & Buster's puts your crappy food on a jazzy plate.   The worst part was the TVs must've been in control of a 13-year-old. Nothing but Disney kids (High School Musical) music videos on screen.   One bet is for sure - I'll never come back here again.",

To begin, we eat early, the restaurant was not crowded and most of the tables in the section we were seated at were empty.  We were given a menu to peruse and I noticed a few other tables being seated after us.  When our waiter finally showed up to the section, he basically got to EVERYBODY else before making his way to our table.  Other people got their drinks before we were even greeted by him.  I don't know if he was new, or the hostess didn't tell him who should have been seen to first, but I find this to be absolutely ridiculous.",

Otherwise, I would give the food here a 1 star rating for lower-than Denny's quality food for Cheesecake Factory prices. Now, you should stop reading this and decide to not eat here or to just step in and take a look around if you're into the whole movie prop/setting appreciation thing.  We ordered: Spaghetti Pomodoro: Pretty much just pasta with marinara from the jar, and the portion was about a kid's meal size. Chicken broccoli pasta: They used a white creamy sauce that had no flavor, my gf had to add in pepper flakes and mix it with marinara sauce from my dish. The chicken breast was dry, cooked almost as bad as how I would cook it myself. Bacon cheeseburger: the 2 other friends each ordered this. Neither finished theirs, making a comment saying that the pictures on the menu are deceiving.  I guess the most frustrating part of all this is the fact that the place was about half-full, and our food seriously took about 45 minutes or so to come out. And as you can see from what we ordered, there's no way it should've taken that long  Cliff Notes: Avoid.",

I came with a couple of my co-workers a few days ago after a conference and it was just so mediocre to be the \"Planet Hollywood\" and especially on the Las Vegas Strip! When you add that part in there one would think that they would be on their game that much more due to the location. In fact, it's almost like the exact opposite.  When we arrived the hostess was preoccupied flirting with another worker and seemed more interested in him that really getting us seated but I shall digress. Once we were seated we had to ask another worker who was walking by to borrow a rag or move us to a different table since ours was dirty... After moving to another table that was just a tad bit cleaner our server finally decided to come over and greet us.  Our order was as followed :  Appetizers: Five Cheese Dip ($11.99), Potato Skins ($11.99)  Entrees : Mushroom, Onion & Swiss Burger, Margherita Pizza, L.A. Lasagna,  In summary the food was just OK nothing to write home about and then to have the service not really be up to par really put a complete damper on the entire experience. Nobody should have to keep asking for refills on the simple things like water. What made matters even worse was they weren't even that busy.. The jury is still out on the decision of whether I'll be returning or not...",

We then waited in line for over 45 minutes to check in.   I requested to speak with a manager to express my dismay and encountered a rude exchange with your Asst manager, Francisco Escalante. Francisco informed us that when you arrive at the property at the property late this is expected. Hmm, I would think quality service would be provided consistently to all your customers.   Please contact me immediately so that I may discuss this matter. This is our first experience at your hotel and your manager did NOT leave us with a good impression. I hope Francisco's lack of professionalism is not indicative to what we will encounter during the remainder of my birthday celebration.   So, that you are aware lines are coming at the registration desk because, you are understaffed. However, you have front desk managers on site who are in the office hanging out not assisting their team members.   This is our first and last time staying at your property.   Such a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!  Dr. Natakie Chestnut",

We rented out the patio, which had a beautiful view of The Strip. We were hosting a surprise birthday party and the staff we're very helpful and accommodating to our needs. They allowed us to show up early and decorate. We had a bar tab limit, and the staff were willing to hold off on starting the bar tab until we were ready. They checked on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. The drinks were delicious; we also had an array of appetizers, which tasted okay, but nothing special. There was a variety of food for people with different dietary needs. All in all, we had a great time and I would definitely come back.",

Check in through the kiosk system was quick and easy and I was up to my room within 5 minutes.  I was assigned an 8th floor room overlooking the parking structure.  The room its self was well appointed with comfy beds, wall mounted flat screen TV, a counter and a wardrobe in the main room that had enough room to hang clothes and also held an electronic safe.  Everything was modern, clean and in good shape.  The bathroom was nice.  Toilet in a separate room, large soaking tub, a separate stand up shower and large vanity with plenty of space.  It took me some time to get used to the layout of the hotel as the elevators are a little hidden from the main casino floor so I ended up wandering around the first day to find the elevator to my room.  The location of Planet Hollywood is good center strip, right across of the Cosmopolitan.  I was able to walk to all the Hotels from the Venitian all the way down to New York New York.  Staff at the Planet Hollywood were great.  Always friendly and helpful.  This first visit was great and has put Planet Hollywood on my list along with Rio, Venitian and Ballys",

There was very few people there. When we first came up to the reception desk, the lady immediately asked if we had any coupons or discount cards. Obviously, a lot of people come for the GO card. With it, we were given a one page menu as there's only three options, hamburger, cheeseburger, or veggie burger with fried, a drink (soda or ice tea), and ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, or chocolate). It would've been nice if they also gave us the regular menu as some people may want to order extras like an appetizer.   I decided to try the veggie burger which was made of various veggies (mushroom, water chestnuts, bell peppers, green onions, etc) but no black bean. The party itself was flavorful but I couldn't tell any of the veggie flavoring. Fried were the thin kind and had crispy flavoring on the outside and they were nice and hot which was very good. We did receive very good service as our server was attentive, brought out another drink when ours were half empty, and introduced us to the night shift server taking over. Overall, food was mediocre but service was good. Bathroom could've used some attention (it was also a little hard to tell where the bathroom was as one side had M and another had W and the entrance was a frosted glass door)",

We were tired and hungry, and I was looking forward to grabbing a bite, as I had dined at the former Myrtle Beach location several times.  I even knew what I wanted before we arrived.  After being seated by the hostess, we were completely ignored by every employee in the restaurant.  We saw many servers and even a manager in our area of the dining room several times, yet no employee could be bothered to acknowledge us.  The dining room wasn't even close to being full and there were many empty tables.  We waited about 15 minutes before we finally gave up and left.  We ended up at Spago, which has infinitely better food and service, so I guess I should thank Planet Hollywood for doing us a favor.",

    "text": "I'm just going to put it out there, why is the Planet Hollywood restaurant not at the Planet Hollywood hotel?  Anyways, based on other reviews I feel that maybe the reason I've rated it a little higher than most is because of the memories I have of this location from when I was younger. I remember thinking how exotic sounding Captain Crunch breaded chicken tenders from the kids menu sounded. Supposedly it was one of the founders favorite ways to eat chicken tenders and did it taste awesome! I remember coming here and waiting over an hour for a table and them using both levels of the restaurant. I also remember there being employees in the womens restroom that offered you towels, lotion, mints and other small toiletries.   However, that being the past, lets get into my visit last weekend. My boyfriend and I always come here whenever we are in Vegas. Do I think it's a shadow of it's former self? Yes. Do I still enjoy the kitschy decorations? Yes. Would I come back again? Yes.  We were seated on the lower level in the room that's supposed to look like a set from a sci-fi show/movie. We were sitting next to a large group celebrating a birthday. We were using a coupon which was 20% off $30. You can find a lot of coupons for this place. However, the best one is one you get at the concierge of The Forum Shops which is a free appetizer.   After we were seated the waiter came up and took our drink orders. Since we had been drinking liquor all day we decided to go with soda. Since this is a Pepsi establishment I ordered Sierra Mist and my boyfriend went with Pepsi. \"I'm sorry, we don't have anymore Pepsi.\" Okay, they the boyfriend decided to go with root beer. \"I'm sorry, I think we're out of root beer as well.\" The waiter left to go check and was able to bring back the root beer. What kinda place runs out of soda on a Saturday night?   We ordered the \"World Famous Chicken Crunch\" appetizer, two side salads with ranch and a fettuccine alfredo with chicken and vegetables to split. The chicken crunch is actually the Captain Crunch chicken tenders I remember from when I was younger. It's usually my favorite part of the meal. The salads came out after the chicken tenders and it's your typical salad. Nothing special about it.  Then the main course came out with two plates to split. It was good but we couldn't finish it because it was too much food! They offered to box it to go but we are in Vegas, we weren't going back to the room and would probably leave it somewhere. Needless to say, no dessert. Paid and left.  This past year I've noticed that they have a live DJ in the little window where they used to have a souvenir stand. I've only noticed him in the evening though and not at lunchtime. I don't know if it's a seasonal or regular thing though. I come to Vegas in the summer and sometime in Spring and he was there both times.",

The waitress was very kind, so was the hostess. This place is quite at 1230 in the afternoon. So if you want to come to a quiet place to get away from people for a bit this is it.

There's a Planet Hollywood hotel. The restaurant is NOT in that. It's at the Caesar's Palace forum shops. By the time we found it, we were famished. Luckily, it appeared that we were the only patrons in the entire restaurant, so we were immediately seated. That was the last of the fast service, however.   We waited several minutes for someone to take our drink order and then quite awhile for said drinks to be delivered. Our food also took a long time. We played a few phone games to pass the time and try to distract ourselves, but we grew hungrier by the minute.   Our food eventually came and was very good. I had a salad and my wife had a cheeseburger while our son ate a club sandwich. Everything tasted great. We had to flag someone down to refill our drinks and remind them of the lemons we had requested when we ordered the drinks.   The prices were fair and food was delicious. But the wait time was far longer than it should have been much shorter-especially since we were pretty much the only ones there.",

We asked for well done, we got medium well. We asked for no cheese, we got cheese and when asked if we can get it off, they just scraped it off lol. We asked how many ribs came with the meal; we were told an amount, when the food came out there were less ribs, when we asked about it haha they said sorry that's how it used to be, no apology for the wrong amount told which was the deciding factor for this persons meal.  Sorry guys, planet Hollywood usually rocks, but this one here in Vegas at Caesar's Palace was rough.",

They put us in a room backing a elevator and it sounds as though a freight train is running through the room every few minutes. I am paying $160 a night and $42 resort fee for phone calls and the gym which I won't be using on this trip. I called down to ask for a room change as it is impossible to sleep through the room shaking and was told there is nothing they can do I must go downstairs and talk to a manager. I go downstairs and speak to manager \"Frank\" who informed me there is nothing he can do but give me EARPLUGS!!! I won't be getting any sleep tonight due to noise and will never stay at another Cesar resort ever again!!!",

The last time I was in a Planet Hollywood they were still serving Captain Crunch coated deep fried chicken fingers. Ih those were the days. This modern relic still feels like 1990 something and the menu is limited and simple, but my partner and I split the traditional cheese burger with cheddar and damm if that burger wasnt great and cooked as ordered. I was expecting it to be over done and dry.  It was anything but.  Served warm and juicey.  It was pleasantly delicious.  The fries that came with it were also great and a good compliment to the overall meal.  The gentleman at the table next to us both ordered the NY Strip steak and also commented how good it was.  Our server was nice, adequate and unremarkable. Nothing outstanding but nothing to complain about. Planet Hollywood scores high on food quality even if the selection is limited.  The service is fine and the decor is so dated its almost kitchy that it feels retro and comfortable.  I am giving Planet Hollywood a generous 4 stars because wuite frankly I  was expecting something in line with a Friday's and what we got was so much more...",

We never would have chosen to eat here, but it was the dinner portion of our Dinner & Show package at the Flamingo.   Turned out it was a great deal since the package included the show and the meal including tax and tip for just over $100 per person.  My wife ordered the 10oz. Mushroom Swiss Burger & I had the Cajun Chicken Pasta.  She asked for \"medium\" and it was cooked appropriately, juicy and fresh-tasting. The bun was also fresh and home-baked tasting.  French fries were served hot and fresh.  The pasta dish was outstanding!  It was just spicy enough and loaded with chicken.  There were many choices on the special menu which we were offered as part of our package. We would definitely return here to check out other menu items on our next trip to Las Vegas.  If this place is your destination, I would suggest that you walk in from the Forum Shops entrance to Caesar's off LV Blvd.  We came in the main casino entrance and it seemed we walked 3 miles through crowds of people to find the Planet Hollywood Restaurant.  By the way, the service was very good too.  And our waitress made it very clear that the tip had been prepaid.",

My friend and I ordered the L.A. Lasagna, one of their signature dishes. The picture on the menu looked delicious, unfortunately the food was not. They were little lasagna rolls and the outside layer was fried. It just tasted really cheap, especially for a $17 dish. My other friend ordered chicken (i dont remember the specifics) with mashed potatoes and spinach. Now that was good. If I ever did come back I definitely wont be getting the LA Lasagna again.",

First off I would like to thank Where Magazine and Planet Hollywood inside the Forum Shops for inviting all concierges to check out their new location. WAY BETTER than the old one. LOVE THE PATIO VIEW!!  We were offered a breakfast buffet that included pancakes with blueberry compote, eggs benedict, bacon, sausage, omelettes, fresh fruit and a couple items I am missing. All were delish but the Denver omelette was my fav. We were also promised mimosas on the invitation. When we arrived we were offered juice or coffee. Luckily I stayed til the end when the champagne arrived and indulged in a couple early morning cocktails. The management and staff were all super nice and made sure they worked the room and introduced themselves to all of us.  If I was a tourist or had company, I would not hesitate to bring them here. Awesome decor and one wall dedicated strictly to Vegas with all Vegas based movies. Hopefully I will be in the Forum Shops soon so I can stop by for a drink or bite.",

I was disappointed at what I got for my dollar for being a supposedly upscaled restaurant. I had gone here last I'd say in the last 90s so it was in the other location, so finding it on the top was a surprised for me since it was a little harder to find in the isolated area of the Forum Shops. I thought the decor could have been much better since they had a larger selection at the one they had prior so moving the decor should not have been an issue. Then the prices had risen so much more than the past that shrinking the portions and selection didn't make things better. The steak I had for the price was probably on par with that of Black Angus and even maybe Outback which both have fallen so far from previous years and lacked flavor. The shakes and beer portions were a total rip off and honestly took us forever to find our server since I believe they were the only one aside from another server working. For the price you'd think they add more help and I do miss the original planet Hollywood chain since this one was so far off what once was. Oh and some of the appetizers were burnt",

The ribeye was cooked properly, but thickness wasn't consistent and it needed salt ... still it was a good value for the price.  The veggies were a bit too raw.  We also had Long Island Iced Teas which were good, and the dessert special (layered brownie/cheesecake/raspberry/whipped cream goodness).  I see a lot of Yelps about service being a problem, but it may be that they are listening and working on the problem since we had excellent service.",

That being said the food is another story, I ordered the caesar side salad and linguini primavera. The salad was so saturated and limp I couldn't eat it. They also used the cheap Parmesan powder cheese, which for a $6 side salad I would expect better. Then the pasta, well the veggies were undercooked to the point of almost raw and the sauce was more of a runny soup. I would not recommend either of these dishes. We went with 25 people and not one person said their meal was actually good! On top of that when we booked the party we were never told about an admin fee that is tacked on top of your bill which is calculated as a percentage of your total bill.  It wasn't a large amount, but they charged everyone I'm the party which adds up!",

So what did we do the next day?  You guessed, it came back again 16 deep.  Same shit maybe even worse.  Anyway we left w/ even a lower bill and even more drinks.

Got a few cocktails which were delicious and on the stronger side (Hey its better then a bartender jipping you of alcohol). Ordered food and for the FIRST time ever when we asked the waiter about a certain dish he gave us his honest opinion. We asked about a few and he said to definitely not go with those as they were not very well liked by other customers or himself. He finally gave us great recommendations and those views were upheld when the fork or burger met my mouth. Overall, great place to go to without spending a mound of money like other Vegas restaurants and the service was great!",

    "text": "In my opinion, Planet Hollywood (\"PH\"), at least in Las Vegas, gives off all the signs of a dying restaurant.     My wife and I visited Planet Hollywood in Caesar's Palace several times in the 90's.   The food was fair, but the atmosphere was cool enough to make up for it.  They had really cool move artifacts, like Darth Vador's costume.  The vibe was also energetic.  It actually felt like stepping into something from Hollywood.  The food wasn't too expensive, maybe $8-10 a plate, and the portions were generous enough that you left satisfied - if not blown away.  On our recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give it a try again.  Now with two young children, we thought this might be a fun experience for them.  We learned that the location had changed and made our way to the new restaurant.  When I saw it, I should have turned the other way.  The new decor was an attempt to be cool, without pulling it off.  Kind of like a geeky school kid wearing what he thinks is the latest fashion.  PH no longer had the dark vibe, but instead looked like it was designed by IKEA with red chairs and a modern look.  In addition, the movie artifacts were meager and not interesting.  For example, they have a dress form some movie that no one cares about.  The only cool thing that I recall was a model of the Starship Enterprise.    Well, maybe the food would make up for it.  My wife and I ordered expensive entree salads.  My children ordered something off of the children's menu.  The children's menu was overpriced and about the quality of McDonald's food.  Both of my children left hungry.  The salads tasted fairly good, but the portions were ridiculously small.  Sorry PH, you can't make yourself a top quality restaurant by simply reducing your portion sizes.  That is the first sign of a crappy restaurant in my opinion.  They think they can give you practically nothing to eat and pretend that they are upscale.  I don't mind that at the right restaurant, with best-in-the-country chefs, but PH is far from that.  Instead, PH serves food about the quality of Chilies' and can't pull of the small portion sizes.  At least somewhere like Chilies' makes up for food quality by giving you enough food to leave full.  So, in the end, I had a fairly good tasting salad, which was too small to satisfy, and too expensive to ever motivate me to come back.  We spent over $60 for two adult meals, two children's meals, and no drinks or appetizers.    The worst part, and the reason I think the place shows signs of eminent closure was the stupid post card fraud.  They show up at your table, when you just want to be left alone and ask if they can take the families picture for a \"complamentry postcard.\"  Then, after you have finished and want to get out of the place, they show up with the postcard.  The postcard is the size of a postcard, but the photograph has been reduced to the size of a postage stamp.  Then, they pull out some fancier versions and try to sell them to you for ridiculous prices.  Oh yah, I want to spend $25 to commemorate my lousy dinner at your restaurant.  No thanks.  And of course, they don't take the first no as a no and keep pushing.  I almost lost my cool with them at that point.   I gathered the family and got out of there.  A good restaurant could survive on selling good food, not photographs  I wouldn't recommend PH to anyone.",

The bun it was on was that overly processed white bread that you buy at the store for 99 cents a loaf. My friend ordered the chicken tenders and I thought mine was bad! It tasted like they pulled them out of the back of the freezer after sitting there for about a year. I have no idea what the seasoning was on them but that was awful too. We dined with 2 other people and their food wasn't any better. For all 4 of us, with one drink each and a meal, we walked out of there $110 poorer. I would have been happier to have lost that in one bet at the roulette table. And to top it off we all felt sick to our stomachs about an hour later. Long story short, I would never eat here again even if somebody paid me to.",

    "text": "Jose was a great waiter. The hostess had no crayons for the kids menus. Jose worked hard and was able to find some by the time the food showed up. So trying to keep the kids entertained until then was a handful. The food was mediocre. The chips in the nachos tasted stale and did not look appealing. The Cajun chicken and pasta was watery, no spice or other flavor. The chicken looked and tasted like they came out of a frozen bag or can. My kid's cheese pizza looked like the 99 cent pizzas you heat up in the microwave. There was no firmness to the crust at all. My daughter's macaroni and cheese did have a great taste and creaminess to it, but because they sprinkled diced parsley on top of it, she would not eat it. The chicken tenders looked okay. Overall the food was very poor quality. The only good thing were the drinks. I have never been to a restaurant that had kids menus to draw on and not have crayons readily available. This just shows the place is going downhill when it cant  afford to restock itself with cheap crayons. At least we had a very attentive waiter that did his best to take care of us and find us a few crayons, unlike the hostess who totally forgot about us.",

They changed their location and they changed their menu but this place continues to be a staple in my Vegas trips.  We were served by Anthony, a transplant that has been living in Vegas for 14 years.  He was nice, upbeat, smiley and very quick.  He checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed/wanted to have an amazing dinner experience.  We had fun hearing his Poltergeist story of the clown on site and his laugh made my night.  I ordered the Blackened Cajun pasta and it has mushrooms with chicken and it was very flavorful.  Yes, I will be back and yes I love Las Vegas!",

The hotel casino is close by, but this restaurant is in the mall.  I do have to mention that it's a bit pricey.   I ordered a Pretty in Pink smoothie that was absolutely delish!!!  I should not have though, because I filled up on it and barely touched my lunch. LOL!   I knew I wouldn't have room, but I got the Chicken Crunch, since it was their claim to fame, and shared it.  It comes with 4 thin, but long pieces. It was very good, because it was hot and crunchy. It has a slightly sweet flavor that set it apart from other chicken strips.   Then I got the LA Lasagna that was also very good. It was pasta stuffed with meat and cheese, rolled up, breaded and fried. Then it's topped with a cream sauce and set on top of a bolognese sauce.  I really liked it, but couldn't even finish one of the four pieces it was cut into. So I took it home!    There's plenty to look at while your eating with all the movie memorabilia on the walls, and it's in a great location in the mall if you want to shop afterwards.   Lastly, stop by the mall concergie on the way in and they give you a coupon for a free appetizer with your meal!!",

The patio outside offers a fantastic view of the Vegas Strip and has a few tables. The restaurant seems pretty quiet, not a lot of customers, but great service. My husband ordered one of their burgers which was honestly one of the best he's ever had. The meat was more akin to ground steak! Just delicious!

The burger was just ok, lacking a bit of juicy flavor that I would have expected.  The fries were just average.  The service was very friendly though.  Some others in my party ordered the blackened chicken pasta and the grilled chicken sandwich.  They thought their food was good.  I don't know if I would make it a point to return here on my next trip.",

At these prices, they just don't make the cut. I have not been impressed with the food at other Planet Hollywood outlets in the past, but since this was part of a Theater-dinner package, the choice was not ours and we elected to give it a try.  If you only care about the atmosphere, go for it. But even the casino buffets have better quality food than this. In my book, PASS!  We did not try the bar, so perhaps it is better.",

It was very slow, many tables available and they still wouldn't give us the happy hour deal at the table.

They said,  \"sorry, we have some private parties scheduled.\" The tables were empty and we  only had about an hour to eat. We asked to see the manager, but the hostess belatedly offered us seats in the bar. The tables were less than knee height. Very awkward for eating dinner. We never saw the manager.

    "text": "Sadly not good, having been to PH in Orlando and loving the LA Lasagna I was craving it so I headed to PH at Caesars Palace. First off I made a reservation just in case it was busy and being a party of 1 and a non drinker I truly despise always being told if I want to be at the bar, as if I'm wasting a table or un worthy of having a table to myself. Any ways I arrived to a restaurant and mentioned I had a reservation and of course first thing I'm asked is do you want to sit at the bar. Now I admit this is no reason to gripe so I just laughed at the irony as I was sat at a table that I requested. No big deal I was hungry and the LA lasagna was calling. I sat down and first thing I was was a picture of delicious buffalo wings twice cooked it claimed, when they arrived they were plump and juicy looking, as I bit into them they were rubbery and had a bad after taste, and I couldn't quite put my fingers on it but they were just odd, not crispy on the out side and and rubbery on the inside and water seeping out of them, that's when I noticed the yellowish rubber skin that only wings that are boiled get, yes these wings were boiled, who boils wings, this explained the nasty water after taste when I asked the waiter how they were cooked he said I believe they are boiled, with out me even saying a word, the chef later came out and claimed they were baked then deep fried but yet they were out in a jiffy and if they were deep fried why no crisp outside that even a few seconds in the fryer makes, the oven does not make they watery, yes not juicy, not fryer grease water! I ate them as I was starving and then the waiter asked if I wanted him to remove it off the bill and I said no I ate it and I'll pay for it but why would you do this to guest, no wonder the restaurants empty. If you are a noble restaurant don't ask guest if you want the item taken off just comp it and save your reputation. Also I will point out both the waiter and chef talked to me at the table and the restaurant manager just walked by with out once wanting to know what was going on, take pride in your restaurant and try to solve the issue if you see a guest is upset but she chose to not even acknowledge anyone in the restaurant even though there were only four tables with guest. Sadly my LA lasagna was a disaster in itself, the shells were 1/4 full with little to no meat and sauce and the shell was tough, far cry from the crisp full shells of Orlando PH, where everything was spot on, that location was truly busy in Disney Springs but both the servers, chefs, and hotel managers took pride in their job, the food was great and the manager which greeted us and server were very attentive.",

    "text": "I went here, to PH at the Ceasar's Forum shops, to pick up my Las Vegas Power Pass in their gift shop. That transaction went fine, and IMHO the Power Pass is worth it if you're planning on sight seeing and not gambling. It gives you free entry to some of LV's most popular touristy attractions, plus discounts at certain places. One of those discounts was a $10/day credit right here at  the Planet Hollywood restaurant in the Forum shops.  The first time I visited, I got a huge omelette & coffee. The waiter was nice, and after the credit, I owed about $2.50 - not bad. Gave the guy $5 and was on my way.  The second time, the hostess was very strained in asking me how I was. She didn't seem to be having fun at all. What a downer. Okay, brushed it off. I ordered a hamburger w/bacon & cheese, side of veggies, and it tastes decent. But then the bad part: my waiter with the blond curly hair (didn't catch his name). He acted a little weird, but whatever. I was at PH, didn't expect exceptional service or food (it's just slightly above that of an IHOP really). When my bill came, he automatically had added his 15% tip, without having asked me first. What a douche. I overlooked it, because I WAS going to give him 20%, so he saved me some change. Okay. I paid with a credit card. After I signed the receipt, he started addressing me as \"Miss [Last Name]\". Alriiight. hum.  Third time I go, I get the same guy, he has little bursts of weird conversation with me, then ignores me the rest of the time. Then the bill comes, and he's added his 15% again. Okay. This time I pay with cash, and I should get $10 back, only I get a $5 bill and four $1s. He's stiffed me a dollar. After already giving himself a 15% tip. WTF? Probably, he gets paid shit, and it is just a dollar - BUT STILL. He shouldn't have done that. I should've asked for a manager at that point, but I didn't. I never really plan on going back again, but hell - I would recommend staying AWAY from here to anyone considering visiting. Just pick up the Power Pass and leave - for good. Leave the klepto-robber-hobbit-hair-waiter to some other victim tourists. (I know, it was just a dollar, but it still really bugs)",

The first day we got lunch (I got the crispy chicken tender things which were great) and we only paid $4 (which is amazing for vegas). The next day we got drinks and an appetizer. The appetizer was super slow to come out, and the bartender accidentally rimmed James' margarita in sugar, and didn't remake it. It was also a bad margarita...just didn't taste good, and we're pretty sure it was because of the well alcohol. I got the castaway, which was fantastic. It was like a cross between a margarita and a mojito, but with a berry-ish flavour. I don't really know how to describe it, but I'm picky about alcohol and it was great. However, it was STRONG. Admittedly, I'm a bit of a light weight, but it was a LOT of alcohol.  All in all, I would definitely go back. The bar was a fun ambiance and what I got was pretty good and decently priced (a little on the high end, but not bad). It was also fast service, which let us get back to our trip faster.",

For the price we paid, I would have paid an additional 20 dollars per person and still been happy.  The food was abosoluty delicious.  I had the ribs and will stop by next time and vegas, just to eat the ribs again.  Veronica and her staff was amazing.

    "text": "I wasn't terribly excited about going here for dinner, but we had half price coupons, and it was close to the show we had tickets for.   Turns out I was totally impressed.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  Service was quick.  Food was brought to the table hot off the grill.  My steak was cooked perfectly, and the ribs that my husband ordered were tender and flavorful.  As we were leaving, we realized that we had lingered a little too long, and had to move fast to make the beginning of our show.  The manager took the time to escort us on a shortcut, and even ran back to get my jacket that I realized I had left!  Amazing friendly service and great food, too.",

    "text": "I agree with the majority here.... in general, Planet Hollywood Sucks!! We weren't expecting great food, but the food is sooooo bad, and the place just stinks of smoke, and if that wasn't bad enough, the rooms are total skank!! Filthy carpets, chunks of wood out of the furniture, and had that awful smell from when maids try and mask the smell of tobacco from the previous jerk who stayed in that non smoking room!! Total SKANK !",

    "text": "This is located on the upper level of Cesar's Palace.  We went on a Friday afternoon and were seated almost right away at a comfortable seating area directly in front of the restaurant.  Even with people walking by, it was quiet and comfortable.  The server was friendly and the food was excellent.  It is pricey like most strip restaurants.  There is an employee who walks around talking photos of your group.  You get a complimentary photo and additional photos are aorund $20.  Cute photos, but expensive.  We had a great time and would return again.",
