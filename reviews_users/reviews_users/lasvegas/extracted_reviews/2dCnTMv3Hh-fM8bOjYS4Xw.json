Tonight, I finally decided to drop in -- this is one of those reviews for me that is hard to write. I know a person's review is their own opinion but I try to always be fair about the things that I write.  When I walked in I was surprised to see a fast food like environment. I wanted to try both the chicken and the ribs, so she sold me a \"combination plate\" this consisted of one small piece of chicken. I requested White meat, three small ribs a childlike side dish -- I chose the chicken pasta a very small salad and a small beverage.  I would rate the food as \"good\" but not worth the cost; especially for the portion size provided. I initially ordered my meal to be consumed in a restaurant. Within five minutes of my food being delivered, they got a rush of people in. The place is too small to have any kind of comfort while eating. I then asked for a to go box.  Will I go back? MAYBE... I know that at those prices, it can't be a regular place to dine. Three or four times a year perhaps. It will definitely be take out though.",

Admittably the signage is hard to spot and you have to access it by spinning around on Sahara but the aroma alone will draw you from blocks away! They smoke/grill their meats inside and out in front and the flavor is magical. It does beat places in town that charge TWICE as much. The inside is comfortably humble so you feel fine \"digging into your meal\". They have a great array of sides. Dine there once and you may never throw a backyard BBQ again! No need; you'll come here instead! Cheaper and easier... BETTER.",

The grilled corn was juicy, the fruit was sweet, the cole slaw I didn't care for, the sweet potatoes were good, sauteed veggies was crispy, & the mac & cheese is a pass. The grill outside will pull you in with the smoke billing from the outside charcoal grill. The rotating grills inside holds some ribs & chicken. We ate there 2 days in a row lol.

I go through cravings, and when it's for chicken I really like their grilled chicken (they also got rotisserie style). I really like it's flavoring, I believe it's mediterainian type seasoning.  Also, recently, I started trying their grilled pork ribs, and I really like them and have been on a steady crave for those the last few times I've been there. They serve them dry with the sauce on the side. And I like this. If your dry rub is good, then you shouldn't have to smother your ribs in bbq sauce.  I've seen a bunch of bad reviews here on Yelp, and I will say they have their bad days (or orders). In my experience, every 6th order is fudged a bit. They need to clean this up and become more consistent. But the place is always crowded...I guess by people who don't post on Yelp!  But I want more places like this. Where else can you get freshly grilled or rotisserie chickens other than the supermarket? And the quality and taste is much better than the market - although almost double the price ($5 market, $9 at NCC).  I wish there was a place like this in Henderson, near my work, as it would be perfect for my lunch needs (fresh meat, no carbs - unless you splurge on sides).",

When I picked up the sandwich it fell apart... but the parts that I did eat were decent. The Chicken Pasta was Pink! I love that color and I'm not picky so I tried it. It was sweet and sour and I maybe found one tiny piece of chicken in it. I couldn't eat a third bite and my husband couldn't stomach a second bite. I left it alone and sipped on my sugar free Watermelon Juice. I liked that they have sugar free options but I didn't like that they didn't put ice in my drink especially when it's so hot outside! My husband had the Chicken Caesar Wrap and a side of salad. I tried the wrap and that tasted fresh and the salad was also good. The salad was big for being a side item. The food was okay but it's nothing I would  crave for.",

The cashier (girl with glasses and braces who I believe is Andrea) quickly said yeah when I asked for the dressing on the side. What I got was a salad drenched in dressing. It was late and so I didn't have time to return it. The second time I also ordered with her and the same thing but this time I sent it back. Third time I went to the Arroyo location and the guy got my order right! Well I decided to return to the arroyo location even if it is out of my way just to not have the mixup happen again. I went in and almost walked right back out when I saw Andrea was the cashier. I ordered and said \"please make sure the dressing is on the side\" she said yup and of course I did not get dressing on the side. The food is great and everyone else is wonderful but I will walk out if she is the cashier next time.",

When I had gone to the new location I thought the chicken was decent, however, now coming to the Sahara location I'm not sure if I would return Nevada Chicken Cafe.  The wait time alone is a turn off! After placing my take out order I waited another 25 or so min before getting my order. Why did it take so long? There were no other orders for them to kick out because there was barely anyone there when I arrived and everyone seated at booths were already eating.  When I finally got my food and took it home, I realized that they hadn't given me any utensils...luckily I wasn't trying to eat in the car or something otherwise I would've been screwed. I had ordered a half chicken w/ mashed potatoes and a chicken cobb salad w/ blue cheese. The half chicken were tiny pieces and there were only 3 of them instead of 4. Is the wing not considered part of one half of a chicken? Because I didn't get one. The mashed potatoes were garbage and had no taste to it even though it was smothered in gravy. The cobb salad ironically looked much larger than the half chicken, but I had gotten it for the gf. Maybe I should've gotten 2 salads since both meals were about the same price at $9-10 each.  If the half chicken meals are this small I could eat 2 chickens then. Crazy! If they were going to half ass my meal then they should've gotten the order out sooner! Any other chicken restaurant out there would probably be better than this place!",

Now the sandwich was a surprise of a mountain on the roll with slaw... Myself, I do not care for a soggy sandwich so pass,, But the combo made up with the Rotisserie style ribs... NO SAUCE NEEDED,salad FRESH, beans had a zing to them that I liked.... all in all in my opinion and observation, the quality of the cooking far outreached other bbq establishments that charge  a while lot more and yet the flavor and enjoyment did not match.... cant wait to go again.....",

    "text": "I bookmarked this place months ago, drive by frequently- rolling down my windows and sucking in big lungfuls of their tasty barbecue chicken smell as I pass. I finally caved and got the $20 for $10 Yelp deal and redeemed it today for lunch with the BF.  After extensively checking reviews here and browsing their online menu, I settled on the 1/4 rack rib combo with leg+thigh for my guy, with a side of saffron rice, and a chicken mozzarella wrap for myself with the mac and cheese. Opted for a taste of home with a Dr. Pepper for our drink, and hit up the salsa bar for a cucumber-based pico de gallo, an orange-looking \"salsa verde\", and a crave-inducing garlic ranch sauce.  Service was quick and friendly, and despite a lackluster exterior, the interior of the place is clean and organized with windowed views to the kitchen where you can watch the guys cutting up the hot grilled meats as you wait for your food. Plenty of booths, and I was downright surprised to see tables of families with eerily silent kids- kids entirely focused on devouring their food. That's downright unusual, and I knew I was in for something special.  The ribs we ordered saucy, at the cashier's suggestion, despite his mention that the dry-rub style sell better. I love a good sauce, and theirs was spot on! Not to spicy, not too sweet, but good balance and robust flavor that complemented the char of the chicken as well as the meaty ribs. BF and I picked off of one another's plates but the obvious was that I should have gone for a second meat plate rather than a wrap.  The mozzarella wrap was large and tasty, and served as an excellent vehicle for that amazing garlic ranch sauce they have, but the taste of the cold chicken was more subdued and the grill-fresh char flavor was rendered almost absent. It's a good healthy-ish option though, but I might opt for a salad instead next time.  As for the sides? The saffron rice was moist and flavorful, and the mac was solid- not dry, not overly cheesy and saucy, but a good version worth having on the menu that doesn't feel too heavy or contrast too sharply with the other major menu offerings.   Attentive and helpful service, damn good chicken and ribs, AND a Yelp deal to offset the price? Done.   Final notes: Use your Yelp app to check in, and get 30% off (not not in combination with the Yelp deal) or sign up for their mailing list online and get coupons and specials to your inbox on a regular basis.",

Unfortunately I messed up and while ordering online I somehow ended up with vegan wrap super disappointing since their chicken is so delicious. I ruined my dinner plans thinking that while ordering from a \"chicken\" place that their wraps would include chicken.   Under the make your own wrap category there is no option to \"add chicken\" so I thought that would mean it's already included. Little did I know that I needed to write add chicken is the special options box which is usually used for items like no onion or whatever.   I called and explained my issue to the store and although the person on the phone was nice she was unhelpful by just telling me I needed to know that chicken is always extra.   It's a f@$king chicken restaurant, why would chicken be extra!   I'll give you guys another try but I probably won't ever attempt to order a wrap again. What a waste of my time. And now I'm hungry and have a stupid veggie wrap I spent 24$ on",

I first went there because I thought that a chicken wearing sun glasses in their logo was too bad ass for me not to try that place. Surprisingly, their chicken was hands down the best chicken I've ever tried! Hey, I been in Hawaii and their chicken wasn't as good as Nevada Chicken Cafe, so yeah here we go.  Nevada Chicken Cafe also offers you a healthy and fresh selection of vegetables, salads, druids and drinks! Of course their main dish is their Chicken, but you can also enjoy amazing pork and cow ribs! Particularly, I like to order their weekly selected combination combos that allows you to try both Chicken and ribs at a discounted price.   My favorite dis as Nevada Chicken Cafe is their 1/2 chicken & 1/4 pork ribs with a cucumber salad on the side, you shall also order their house sauce! Please let me know if you liked this dish because I'm just in love with it!!! If you like my review hit that like button and go get your bad ass Chicken! (This is currently my favorite Chicken in town, for you guys that follow me, remember to stay connected so that I can keep you informed;)",

    "text": "Kind of hard not to check this place out when you can smell the wonderful aroma of ribs and chicken cooking especially on a empty stomach. So at this point, I said what the hell, it smells good so I went in.  I ordered the 1/4 Ribs n Chicken Combo (St Louis Style Ribs, 1 Wing and Thigh, a choice of 1 side, and a drink), which came out to 12 and some change. The ribs were pretty good. Had a dry rub and good smoke flavor to it. The chicken had good flavor but was a bit dry. I chose sauteed vegetables as my one side which was a mixture of broccoli, green beans, carrots, cauliflower, and green peppers.  There is a \"Salsa\" bar towards the back where you can get garlic ranch sauce, hot sauce, salsa verde, and pico de gallo. Now the pico degallo was a bit weird. They put little pieces of cut up cucumber. Never seen that in a pico de gallo  before.  As far as service goes, when you order for dine in they give you a number to put on your table and then they bring it out to you. That is pretty much all the service that you are gonna get.  Overall, everything was decent except for their dry chicken. Come on man! Anytime you have the word \"Chicken\" in the name of your restaurant, that should be the best item that you serve. Imo the ribs were actually better. I think if they pull the chicken out just a tad bit sooner then it should be good.",

    "text": "This is a great lunch spot- order in, take out, or delivery. They also sell whole chickens, which i think you can get for a discount towards the end of the day.   When you order inside the restaurant, you can see the side options and they all look yummy, it's almost hard to choose!  There are two chicken options for the chicken: I prefer the rotisserie chicken over the mesquite, but they are both very good- you should specify which you prefer when ordering. Consider ordering a family meal w/ sides over individual orders to save $$. All of the sides were tasty, including the chicken pasta (cold), mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, salad, etc.   They also serve wraps, salads, and sandwiches, again very delicious. My favorite is the chicken avocado wrap. Mmmm...   Added bonus for NCC is that they let you create your own wrap or salad from scratch and you can order all white meat. Let them know what ingredients you want from the list and they'll whip it up for you.   NCC has an online ordering option on their website, but you have to pay with a credit card (not a fan of this forced payment option). But if you order by phone you can pay cash or card at the counter.",

    "text": "HANGRY!!! That's the word I'm looking for. I'm hangry ... Like a snickers commercial.   When I ordered the family size chicken and ribs that is supposed to come with a rack of ribs the girls told me they only had half a rack left for the night. I said ok if they could throw in some extra chicken.   Then I sat and waited over 30 minutes. While waiting I watched a female employee carry a wet shelf across the kitchen dripping the whole way. She saw it dripping and did nothing about it. She stood it up between a counter and cabinet just behind the register. Then slammed it into place with her butt. She must have seen the look on my face because she then sauntered back and forth swinging her hips like she was pretty proud of herself.   Another girl without gloves tossed a knife into the pile of meat a man was cutting and packaging.   And then there was the woman with the long pony tail flipping around without a net.   My personal favorite was the young lady who filled herself a side container of watermelon with her hand and then grabbed her purse and left. After watching her ungloved hand dig in the watermelon I wrote off one of my side dishes. My watermelon came out of the same container after her hands were in it.   Finally got my food and raced home starving. 3 ribs does not make half a rack. And I got the same amount of chicken I always get with this meal. There was no extra to compensate for the lack of ribs.   The Mac and cheese was good. The mashed potatoes were ok. But we threw the dirty watermelon away in the empty rib container ... Kinda like they threw away a regular customer tonight!!  The service has gotten worse each time I've been in over the past 6 months or so. There is a definite who cares attitude among the staff that there didn't used to be. I am horribly disappointed ... And still hungry ... $50 for dinner didn't fill 3 people with the missing ribs and now I have to cook after waiting half an hour for take out.",

Frankly, I was annoyed and I hope they make the adjustment soon. Not going back, no matter how good the food is! Keep the sports TV, 88 the Hip Hop music!!!",

Had one of the family meals with my wife & three young kids. I would have given a full five stars but the music was too loud and it seemed a little dirty. The food on the other hand was awesome. The chicken was great and the ribs were even better. When it comes to meat, I feel it is good when I DON'T have to add any sauce. Such was the case with the ribs.  Their mashed potatoes were buttery and flavorful. Their mac & cheese had a nice little kick to them & I liked having some little tortillas on the side. I would definitely recommend this place to others, especially because of the ribs!!",

Every time I drove by the area I could see the smoke coming from the restaurant but it wasn't until my friend, an expert on smoke signals, convinced me to try it and the rest is history.... I inhaled, now I'm hooked. They have more than chicken, they also serve BBQ ribs and a great variety of sides, sandwiches and salads. We ordered a whole chicken to go and ate it at home with some homemade sides from previous meals that we already had, the chicken was moist and very flavorful it went great with just anything.  I have a feeling I will be stopping here for chicken every time there's a potluck, family, or friends gathering... nothing wrong for taking credit for good chicken! Totally recommended, so next time you find yourself on Sahara and Jones make sure to follow the smoke, you'll find no gold at the end but you'll find some of the most friendly people, wonderful service and some great food!  You'll  be also supporting a local independent business and that's one ingredient that makes everything more satisfying!",

The experience was nothing special. I spent about 10 minutes in line at the lunch rush and was never greeted until I got to the register to briefly order for 60 seconds and sit down to wait for my food. I brought my \"3 piece meal\" back to my office to discover they only gave me 2 pieces of chicken. Thanks Nevada Chicken Cafe - I am sure it is a great way to reduce cost by shorting orders. How do you literally F that one up. There is nothing in the box but chicken!? The reciept shows 3 and there isnt even an option for 2 pieces on the menu. What idiots are working there? My advice? If you don't care about poor general service for food you could just make at home - go ahead and try it - but check your order.  and for the chicken? well, nothing your average 8 year old couldnt overcook on your backyard grill.",

The music that was playing was so loud I thought I was in a club. I couldn't even hear the cashier & talking to my friend was almost impossible. There was a couple of minutes between the albums & that was a nice rest. Then it started again.   The food wasn't as good as the Sahara location. We both got a combo rib & 1/4 chicken dinner. This time the ribs didn't fall off the bone & it was kind of dry. I had to slather the bbq sauce to make it \"wetter\". The chicken was good but, you could tell that it wasn't as fresh as the first time I ate at NCC. I got a corn on the cobb again but, it was hard as a rock. I had to slather the butter on it to eat the cobb. The last time I didn't even need butter it was so good.   The bus person cleaned all of the dirty tables but didn't even touch our dishes tbat were clearly done. I guess I'm being picky, being in the f & b industry but I hate a dirty table & always try to clear dishes to make room for my guests. I don't get why she didn't do that.   I left a 20% tip with the cashier & absolutely no thank you from the cashier who saw me leave a good tip. It's pretty sad that employees have no personality & have no grace to say thank you. After all Tips aren't guaranteed.  I will be going to the Sahara location instead of the Rainbow location from now on.",

It tasted like plain buttered white rice to me. The cucumber salad was delicious as well. Fresh and had the right amount of tang and sweetness to it. I would definitely recommend this anyone visiting or not.",

NCC offers online ordering for pick up or delivery, but I like the lunchtime energy of the place, so I did my ordering the old fashioned way--in line.  My boss liked his chicken caesar salad, said the greens were fresh, the chicken breast very tasty.  We girls had the half slab each of baby back ribs, seasoned with a great rub which made the ribs deliciously tender.  Finger licking goodness. There was no need for a sauce, even though a tub was included. The sweet potatoes were steamed in natural juices, not sugary stuff, and made a perfect side dish.  We BBQ rib fans have travelled across the Vegas valley for some good ribs and on this day, we all agreed these were the best of the rest!",

On top of all of this the juveniles working behind the counter were more interested in yelling at each other than cooking.  This place is not worth the money and time it takes to get a meal.",

    "text": "I hate this place, yet I constantly go here because its the restaurant that sucks the least out of all venues in this neighborhood.   The first and most flagrant violation that this restaurant makes is that it is a blatant knock off of California Chicken Cafe. CCC is a very respectable chicken chain in southern california that does EXACTLY what Nevada Chicken Cafe tries to do, only 100x better, cleaner, cheaper, and more efficiently. The owner of Nevada Chicken must have gone into CCC, enjoyed his meal, and unintelligently figured he could replicate the same concept in Nevada. I would imagine that if one were to conduct their due diligence, the owner of Nevada Chicken has some personal ties to Southern California and i would imagine his credit card statements would show multiple purchases at California Chicken Cafe restaurants while he was conducting field research / concept theft.    Setting aside the fact that this concept is a ripoff of another restaurant, this place really sucks. When you walk through the doors you are greeted by the smell of stale chicken rotting into the cracks and crevices of banquettes and refrigerator vents. This place is incessantly filthy and you feel like you might get ringworm just by resting your elbows on the tables. How a restaurant manages to stay so filthy, so frequently is beyond me. God forbid you have to go to the 'salsa bar', you will see the remnants of weeks old chicken and tomatoes, salsa stained floors and sneeze guards, and rotting cucumbers. The tables always have old food on them and if you ask someone to clean the tables they'll look at you like you farted in their mouth.   This leads me to the main problem with this restaurant. The staff. Everyone that works at this restaurant seems to have been bludgeoned in the head with a pipe, bat, or brick at some point during their childhood developmental years. I dont typically venture to quick concept restaurants expecting rhode scholar employees to be serving me bbq chicken, but i do expect to pay for what i ordered, and I expect consistency when ordering the same thing twice. I guess the only thing consistent about this restaurant, is that they are consistently inconsistent. If you order an avocado wrap with a side caesar salad, and an additional side of roasted potatoes, you should anticipate receiving something like an avocado-less wrap with a side of corn and and extra side of macaroni. So if you go to this restaurant, make sure you proof read the food once it is handed over. If you do happen to get avocado on your avocado wrap, it will probably come from a premature avocado and your avocado will have the consistency of a frozen stick of butter. Nevada Chicken Cafe is REALLY good at serving un-ripe avocados. I've actually watched the desperate employee in the glasses grab a premature avocado and mash the poor thing on the counter top to try and soften it up so his knife could cut through the skin.   The food here is shit. All of it is bland.   The thing that is so disappointing about this place is that it would take SO LITTLE to make this restaurant good. The concept is so easy... its just chicken. Grill it, cut it, serve it, and dont screw it up. I think thats why I constantly go back. I figure, 'how can they mess this up? It must have been a fluke the last 100 times.' Screw this place. I'm finally done letting you ruin my meals. Fuck Nevada Chicken Cafe.",

The ribs were tender and flavorful, the chicken had an incredible smokey flavor, and the sides were amazing. The chicken chili was on point. First time was free and it made me a believe.

Especially since they serve chicken wraps with sides of spinach feta pasta or chicken pasta, hmmmm... Have seen those somewhere else..   The wrap was good! Tender chicken, loaded with crisp vegetables. The portion size was great, not too big or small. I got the chicken pasta as a side. It had a sweet flavor to it, not too appetizing. My friend got the spinach feta pasta which was a bit salty.   My lunch with a drink was $12, a little pricey for a sandwich and 1 side and no table service.   Not a bad place, but didn't taste anything that I would crave later to make me go back.",

The staff wasn't very friendly, I think I heard a greeting from one or two of them and that was to a different customer.   Now what makes the four star rating is the food. I had the chicken and ribs combo with the sweet potato side. It was awesome. Perfectly seasoned to the point where you don't need to ad any sauce. Meat was very tender. Overall pretty good. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in town. Hopefully the customer service will be a little better.",

It also had some greens so it was quite easy for me to build my own burrito and get some garlic ranch from the salsa bar :-)   You can see how they make the ribs and chicken in the back. Check out my video on that. Pretty cool place with legit food.  Will definitively come back. Yum yum!",

This includes their BBQ sauce that is to die for! Don't be fooled though, their sides are also one of my favorites. In fact, their mashed potatoes are by far the best I've ever tasted! Their Mac and cheese is always fresh and super creamy. Their veggies and fruits are always super fresh.  I've been coming to this place for years now and it's always been the same faces. The employees are ALL working and because they're all so quick, efficient, and friendly, it's hard to tell who their manager is because you can see that much passion in the work that hey do. Let's not forget their owners. They are always present and always going above and beyond to make sure that not only their customers get the best service, but that their employees also also happy and have their support.   My top 10 places for food service of all time!",

The employees seemed less than thrilled to be working, soda machine had no ice, condiments were in 2\" of ice water, and the temperature inside was not tolerable just so many things that were weird.  Took the combo selection of ribs and chicken with bbq beans. The ribs were a that of a boiled mess with some seasoning spattered on it, not tender and tasteless. The chicken had the same seasoning on it and was as dry as the desert heat outside. All served with a mini salad on the side.  Wanted to come here for quite sometime but left me less than thrilled.

I wish I would have taken the move on advice in this case.   I suggested we order lunch from this place for work and we passed the menu around in amazement at all of the option that we had and the ordering began. Once lunch was picked up and brought back we all quickly dug in and then we all quickly stopped digging in. There was a mix of things ordered, Chicken Wraps, 3 piece plates, and sides like mac and cheese and ceaser salads.  I am not overly picky but I will say the chicken in my wrap was EXTREMELY dry and there was absolutely no flavor to the entire wrap. The coworker to my right stopped eating his plain chicken and cheese wrap after he pulled 4 bones out of it and to top it off, one of my other co workers could not stand to eat his mac and cheese because it was so runny..   I apologize now to all of you Nevada Chicken lovers that may be reading this but this place was absolutely horrible and I think we will be going back to ordering El Pollo Loco as sad as that is.",

They smoke their meats right outside the store in the parking lot and the smoky flavor wafts into your car as you drive in! Been hard to find a real bbq in Vegas but look no more! Let me get to the details. My husband and I split the sides we ordered: coleslaw and beans. The beans were outstanding and instead of serving a slice of bread with the meal, they served a fresh, warm tortilla to mop up your bbq beans! The chicken and ribs were moist and smoky and were seasoned so well you didn't need alot of sauce, which by the way is homemade and they took it right out of the pot to give us. Staff super friendly and made sure we were happy. Very reasonable prices as well. Just awesome.",

The menu is large, something for everyone and they also serve a variety of beer which was a big plus for me. I would recommend everyone try this place out for lunch or dinner, I think they deliver as well.",

    "text": "This is an update to my review and response to the owner.  Nico:  Hi Jasson: My name is Nico and I am the owner of Nevada chicken Cafe. First I would like to thank you for your review and honesty. I would like to invite you back to my place to make sure you will get the quality and service you deserve. Please ask for Nico and I make sure you will be taking care from my employees. Again sorry for your bad experience and looking forward to see you soon.... Jason G.  A moment ago  Me: The only way you could improve is as I suggested.   1. Service 2. Seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ). 3. Try a light brine with your chickens, \"dryness\". 4. Just make your sides buffet style, because they won't improve.  P.S. I won't be back... you're lucky you don't have a lawsuit!, My little boy received a decent sized bump on his head and I am sure a nice headache to sleep off that night.  You can improve such as I have stated,  and by spelling my name right, and using better English grammar or that may be why your seats break in the first place... low attention to detail.  I sir have a very HIGH tolerance to many things but, when my siblings get hurt EVERY poor details comes to light. Just let old dogs lay, take your licks, and count your blessings.  Old review:  First time there chicken for both me and my wife was dry... Sides were fruit salad and limp cucumber salad could have made it better at home for less.  Second time back we gave it a second chance this did not happen however, we waited behind some happy people trying to figure out what to order for over 10 minutes while the line behind us backed up.  We finally had our chance to order after noticing 2  people coming up asking where there lunches were.  We took our table it was me, my wife and my 2 year old son...my son feel through the seat down to the floor while I in shock I quickly pulled him out while he began to cry turned to the front counter girl and demanded a full refund ($28 ) and left, I will never be back. They let people sit in broken seats? I doubt there chicken has improved they could improve there service by making the sides ALL buffet style as they are CHEAPLY MADE anyway.",

This place is perfect for a relatively healthy and quick lunch.  The prices are good, and it is a nice change of pace from many other lunch options.  Go with the half chicken, and a side of the cucumber salad.  The chicken is generally moist and well cooked.  The cucumber salad consists of tomatos, red onions, and a delcious grecian vinaigrette.    I've had the salads and wraps a few times, and yes I'll agree with other reviewers that the chicken can be dry, which is why I just stick to the basics.    It's located down the street from LVAC on Sahara, so if you're looking for a quick protein fix after a tough workout, stop by Nevada Chicken Cafe, and say thank you to you wallet, body, and taste buds.",

    "text": "Another \"Yelpalicious Dishes\" weekly lunch with Elnino F.  He's the chicken man so we went to a place that specializes in the cluckins.   Got a breast and wing with a side of saffron rice....they gave me an extra chicken piece so thats always nice! It wasn't that the chicken was bad, but it wasn't even warm which makes me think it's been sitting a while and they didn't bother to throw it into the heat even a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flittle.It&s=24ba0f6ac91b8c9ca12c0273d1a1456b576159e4984450c7667a17ec0d9eaa5c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">little.It</a> wasn't dry, but it wasn't juicy either. It made me sad specially since theres a guy in the front grilling these things....why didn't I get a hot one? That was what made me excited to try this place was the smoke I saw coming from it....my chicken did hit the smoke- but hours ago. Saffron rice has buttery and good. Got a watermelon drink and it wasn't very cold and it needed more sugar to contrast how sometimes watermelon gets that \"green\" taste to it.   They have a sauce station with ketchup, bbq sauce, Red Hot sauce and then a garlic sauce, green salsa, a cucumber salad/salsa, jalapenos and baby peppers.  The garlic sauce was more garlic ranch like dressing, but it worked with the meat...I still prefer the real deal garlic sauce a la Zankou chicken. Cucumber salad was a good cooldown since I was eating the peppers and it got a bit hot.  The chicken was the star and without hot and juicy chicken, it can only be an OK lunch at best. I'll try again to see if I can make sure I get one piping hot, but if I can't then I'll have to bawk bawk away and find me some hot cluckin lovin' elsewhere.",

All that I can say for my first time visit here earlier today I was really impressed with the food.   I ordered the Rib and Chicken Combo. Both the Ribs and Chicken were hot and fresh tasting. The Ribs melted off of the bone and was overall better than a few of the barbecue places I have eaten at. The Chicken was moist and tasted great even before trying their homemade barbecue sauce which was delicious as well.  I plan on eating there again tomorrow and will post an update if I experience an issue with consistency. I truly hope it is as good tomorrow as it was today.   For now... Thumbs up for me...",

Either way I was okay about it because I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon that let me spend $50 for $25. Another reason I was concerned was because I was taking my two picky eating boys with us for lunch. Well I can say that we were happy and enjoyed our meal. We had full rack of ribs, whole chicken, mac n cheese, garlic roasted potatoes, and mashed potatoes and gravy. The kids loved the sides. Me and hubby not so much...but the chicken and ribs were great. They seasoning on the meat was great. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I wanted to try the wings but they were out and wouldn't have them made for one hour. Even after that hour he told us the wings they made were for other people. So one good thing you would have to do is come early or order ahead of time. But I loved the place. We will definitely be back.",

There are so many choices in this city that it's very easy for customers to just move along to new and different places with better service, I'm sure it's a hard place to run a restaurant.  That being said I'll take your advice and start writing some five star reviews for the places I enjoy.(haven't really been much into writing reviews). This experience was such a downer that I could not leave it alone, thanks for your thoughts and I hope you've worked out some of the kinks in the service side of your place.",

Even when the chicken runs out the friendly staff make sure they keep me a happy customer in this case it was Darla at the front who very happily gave me other options to choose from and made sure I still had a pleasant dinner. As for the rest of the crew, Silvia, Jenny, Beatriz, Marielo, and basically everyone who works there always seems to be very positive and smiling. The staff is always very happy to see customers come in and sometimes I even show up at 10 minutes prior to them closing and they always help me with the amazing customer service and delicious food.

In comparison to a more well known establishment, a quick snack to me would be El Pollo Loco's 2 item (breast/wing) combo with rice and sweet corncake with two tacos el carbon.  So naturally when I came I got the 3 piece dark which came with 2 legs, a thigh piece, and two sides (rice, and mixed veggies).    For some reason the chicken tasted dehyrdated.  Like they were made with the intent of it being completely well done and then sat around while you prepared another dish.  The rice was plain and good, and the salad was about the size that Las Vegas Grille serves, good to-go box size full.    I should have tried the 1/4 rib combo that came with a breast and wing, 1 side, and drink but I'll save that for next time.",

    "text": "Anerexic chicken!  So we've been wanting to come here for ages because of the smoke and the awesome smell it produced. Located on Sahara next to the Chevron gas station, the Plaza has plenty of parking. Interior is a cute cafe style setup with booths and 7 individual tables that seat 2 people. There is a subway style counter top where you pick your sides. Buy it's not about the sides here, it's called Nevada chicken cafe, so it's all about the pollo, right?!  NOPE!!!  It's all about the sauces.   1. Dry chicken. 2. SKINNY Chicken 3. Dry chicken. 4. Very skinny chicken.   Lololol..  For years and years we thought this would be the spot to beat. So so so disappointed. El pollo Loco has juicier fatter, in fact Popeys  (next door) has healthier chicken than here.  Like I did mention though, the sauces are good. Garlic ranch and the salsa flavors to be exact. Mama Belle and my wife agreed, without them it would be a total loss.   WHY AM I STILL HUNGRY!!!??   As for customer service, the staff seems friendly. Saying seems because the only person who spoke to us was the cashier. 2 employees were eating at customer designated tables, which they shouldnt. SMILE PEOPLE!!!! Shoots, at least pretend your happy you have a job! But that is not my business. Pretty clean inside the cafe. The smell is amazing but very VERY deceiving.   Overall, the smell was a lure. It's up to you to make this call. We tried and failed. We're off to get something else to fulfill our snack appetite.",

They have a really good family pack that feeds 6,  it is two full chickens, three large hot or cold sides, a large salad, and 6 tortillas for $42.75. The chicken is really flavorful and juicy, the pieces are cut nicely, I love that they cut the breast piece in half so that it is a better size for serving. The side dishes are really really good. I love the mashed potatoes and gravy! The black beans are also another one of my favorites. My kids love their mac and cheese, and the Caesar Salad is pretty good too. They have delivery and are on Uber Eats which is great for me for a busy weeknight, and a little healthier dinner for the kids than the typical take out.",

They offer a variety of  sides, which are a little pricey, but how can one truly complain when you are able to get just about any sides item from healthy to just down right delicious in one stop.  They also offer, salads, wraps, chicken and ribs.  In addition to offering various meats, they have combo meals, daily specials, and family deals.   In regards to the taste of the food, it  is a hits or miss in regards to their seasoning.  Sometimes their food seasoning and quality is spot on, while other times it can be very salty and burnt.  Last night was my first time receiving overall salty ribs, chicken and the chicken was burnt.  Even with this being said, I would still go back to this restaurant.",

I was just driving by and seen some people eating outside. So we stopped by, i asked if we can eat outside with our little dog. No Problem they replied!  Now to the food, They had a pretty good size menu with many options. I had the quarter mesquite chicken white meat with black beans. It was really good, it was a perfect portion. Chicken had great flavor and the beans were great. I also had a salad with it, that was also good.  My mom had some Waldorf chicken wrap. She loved it. This was really big, she also had the mac and cheese for her side dish which she also enjoyed. But the wrap she could not stop talking about. Going off my memory, this wrap had chicken, apples, walnuts, blue cheese, and many other things.  Over all we had a very good visit, service was great, food was great.",

It was a nice day to eat outside anyway.  After 10 or 15 minutes, our food was delivered to us. I took a bite out of my chicken mozzarella wrap and there was more lettuce and dressing in my wrap. There were only a couple slices of mozzarella and some chicken. It was descent but I would rather have less lettuce and tomato than chicken or the mozzarella. The potato salad was delicious. The best item out of my meal. Potato salad was filled with flavor such celery, onions, and potatoes were cooked well.   There is no table service but they clear your table for you after you finish eating. There is a tip jar in front so be sure to tip. Parking is limited but there is parking in the back.",

We ordered a 1/4 rack ribs (which is only 3 bones) for $6.99 with a side, 1/2 chicken for $7.75 with a side, a chicken avocado wrap with garlic dressing for $9.95 with a side, and BBQ chicken sandwich for $8.50 which also comes with a side.    Last time we ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich the coleslaw came on the side, so we were expecting the same this time but sadly it was put on the sandwich, which the person who it was for was not too happy about.   I had asked for extra dressing on the side for my wrap only to find out when we got the food back to work it was not included. Which was a bummer because the wrap itself was actually quite dry and the avocado was not ripe enough. The side of macaroni and cheese was just mediocre at best.   The ribs are really tasty, but a little bit on the pricey side, and honestly the only thing I thing that really shined were their mashed potatoes, they were delicious!    If we visit a third time, I'll stick to their sandwiches with extra meat because they don't have a lot on their giant buns.",

I usually do the chic-n-ribs combo which includes 1/4 rack of ribs, leg & thigh, one regular side and a fountain drink.  They recently raised the price which I'm not happy about but still frequent their three locations in town since the food is freshly cooked and consistent.  The original location has been around since I was a kid growing up in Las Vegas and I remember passing it everyday in high school.  Nevada Chicken Cafe has stood the test of time in a competitive industry and I recommend checking them out for the chicken, ribs and wraps.  The sandwich combos look very delicious as well and I hope to try them in future visits.  The selection of hot and cold side dishes also makes Nevada Chicken Cafe stand out with favorites that include the mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, sauteed veggies and mini salads.",

The amount you get in the combo meals is legit and I haven't had many of their sides but the corn, coleslaw and mashed potatoes were bomb. Now let me tell you why this place has my heart forever now. One night last week we placed an order for a slab and half of ribs and when we got home we realized it was one slab of ribs and what I believe was a half chicken. I called up to the restaurant to let them know, not even upset, more to let them know in case it was going to affect another persons order and this is where they stand behind their product and morals/ values. The manager let me know that they would be providing me with a half slab of ribs and two sides on the house because they made an error. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? Quality customer service hasn't died folks, it just lives at Nevada Chicken Cafe now. I will be a lifelong customer and will be telling every single person I know to give this place a try.",

We ordered a dinner for 4 (which DIDN'T include ribs- we found out when it got to the table, so we ended up getting an extra slab. My opinion: overall---about a 4. I wouldn't go back. Again, not terrible....but not worth a 2nd trip.",

I am not sure if they were using it as a garnish or an ingredient - either way, it ruined the salad (which would have been good without it).",

Well much to my dismay the romaine was wilting, some leaves were turning orange, the croutons chewy, chicken dry, even tried to dip in BBQ sauce and hot sauce, no help.  In their defense, it was to go order but still, if salad isn't right now I wonder about the chicken? Ribs?  I noticed on the walls they had some celebrity photos, maybe if they concentrated on the food more it may be better?  Well I can't say I been missin anything driving by all the time.... I will still try the grilled chicken, let's see how it goes......  C",

Food came out fairly quickly, and the first thing I noticed was the chili was spicy, but served barely warm. My girlfriend asked the woman taking her order if the meal came with a salad and she said it didn't, so she ordered side salads for her and her daughter; the meal came out with salads on the plate AND two more salads that she asked for (basically charged for 2 unnecessary salads). No complaints about their food whatsoever, I even tried a little of the ribs and chicken. The one thing I noticed was the customer area was sparkling, they had someone (sometimes 2 people) cleaning the dining area (you could smell the cleaning supplies a little too much), but I'd rather the restaurant be too clean than not enough.  Even though my meal wasn't hot, it is worth another shot sometime. I will be back again.",

I was pleasantly surprised that the yelp check in was giving a 30 percent off entire purchase discount so that was great.  I ordered 2 full racks w/ a side of mashed potatoes and gravy w/ each rack.  I also ordered a chicken breast for my dog.  When I placed the order I told them one full rack of ribs and mashed potatoes was being dropped of to a friend for lunch so I needed it bagged separate with utensils.  When the order came out I checked to make sure and it was not bagged correctly.  They fixed it for me and I was on my way to deliver it.  Ribs get 5/5 for the great flavor and taste.  I am assuming the chicken rates a 5/5 as well.  I divided it into small portions for my dog and she always wants more.  Recommend to anyone and we will return again soon.  Service is friendly and it smells great when the grill is on.",

I quite like their sauteed vegetables and fresh fruit...they put more than just cantaloupe in the bowl, so I opt for this all the time. I didn't care for the spinach pasta with feta, it lacked flavor which surprised me.   All in all you can't go wrong with the chicken here, I can't wait for the one near my work to open.

Today I stopped to get some items for my son who is sick.  One item was chicken Caesar salad white meat only.  I got iceberg lettuce and croutons.  That's it.  The chicken soup I ordered also has no chicken in it.  This is not unusual sadly - but every other time I think \"they are just off\".  Well I'm done thinking that.  I'm not sure I will go back.",

This may have been understandable if there was a line but there was no one behind me and my friend and this was my first visit. I feel like this was such a missed opportunity for the cashier to give suggestion and guide me through the menu but he was to busy watching the football game on the tv to care about my experience.   I ended up ordering one piece of roasted chicken and one piece smoked. The smoked chicken was better than the roasted but both were nothing special to me. I also had a side of Mac and cheese and a side of fruit. The mixed fruit was well fruit so I can't complain. The Mac and cheese was not good to me at all. It lacked flavor and was just not appealing to me. Overall, not my cup of tea and I won't be back.",

The salad was large and fresh and wrap was good. My wife had a quarter chicken and the mashed potatoes and gravy which she really enjoyed. My mother in law had the six wings and coleslaw. She enjoyed the wings and gave me one. I would say the wings are the worst thing I have had there. The sauce on the wings was a mediocre and the wings didn't have that nice crispy feel to them. The place is definitely worth a stop in but be aware that the place is small and gets very full especially during the lunch rush so make sure you try to get there a little early or a little later.",

That bbq smoke really adds flavor to the meat.  The chicken is cooked well and the portions are fair.  The downside is the service.  Since it's no longer hidden, the crowds have increased but the service hasn't kept up.  The line along the counter to order backs up quickly and that leaves only the 6-7 booths along the window as good dine in tables.  Speaking of tables, they don't seem to get wiped down often and most customers have to clean their own before they sit.  That's really too bad and seems like an easy fix. And unfortunately, the prices have gone up.  As a lunch location, it's pricey, $10-$15+ in most cases. Long story short, 5 stars for food, 2 stars for service = a 3 star rating.",

One of those times it was later in the evening, maybe around 6 or so. I could understand them being out since it was so late in the day. But my most recent visit was at 1:30 and they were out. I don't know if they only make x per day or what, but this is becoming a trend I don't like!   Besides not having my favorite item available, the customer service is pretty bad. On our last visit, there was a decent rush, about 10 people in line, and only one cashier. Not only that, but she would stop in the middle of taking orders, and answer the phone and take their order. Totally unprofessional and rude! They do this every time they are busy too. One weird thing to mention is there are no trash cans so people can't throw away their garbage, so dishes and trash are left on the tables for a ridiculously long time. Also, they need to pay more attention to detail. We ordered a bunch of food and told them we were dining in, yet our food was packaged to go. Also when we specified tortillas with our food, we got dinner rolls. These are all minor things, but they add up to one big annoyance!  In summary, get your shit together NCC! I am not going to boycott this place because I love the food, but I will probably only order to-go from now on.",

You'll often find a staff member outside at the grill roasting chicken and filling the block with its wonderful smells. It's quick service, so you order & pay for your food, and you can dine in or get your food to go.   They offer chicken platters ranging from whole toasted chicken to single pieces of legs thighs and more, they have wraps, salads and more. Almost all dishes come with at least one side dish which are all very yummy with a large variety from healthy fruit to heavy Mac and cheese or potato's.   Most menu items cost between $9-13  I find myself constantly craving Nevada chicken cafe when I need a quick, well balanced meal on the go!",

I was expecting a normal \"club sandwich\" but didn't see it came w/ a roll, chunks of chicken in a Nevada type sauce I wasn't sure what it was a/red peppers and avocado. Just took off the bun and tried to eat a few pieces of chicken but some had veins and cartilage so I didn't eat much. The potatoes were edible but some were very salty so I had to pick through those as well. My guest paid @$17+ for chicken beans and corn on cob w/drink he wasn't happy @ the high price for the amount but he ate it lol. Oh well it wasn't as great as I had anticipated but it had customers so they'll be fine without us lol. (Just FYI-Being forced to \"tip\" on fast food before you receive your food is the worst thing.

One of the men literally screamed at me, telling me that they weren't open.  He was clearly annoyed with the concept that I walked through an unlocked door, at a restaurant where the lights were on and people were working behind the counter.  I was amazed.  I asked if I could simply order something for delivery later; he said I would have to wait 15 min until they were done setting up and the register was open.  I asked if I could order online, and he said yes.  So that is what I did, but honestly, had I not promised NV Chicken Cafe to my team for lunch, I would never have ordered online, nor would I ever return.  I used to eat in your restaurant frequently, and have never experienced anything like it.    Moral to this story, if you don't want people to walk into your apparently open for business establishment, please lock the door! #nevadachickencafe #gladtheyaren'tmyemployees #foodisgreatcustomerserviceisnt",

    "text": "WARNING: if you have any allergies, do your research in advance. The staff is not reliable as they will lie just to make a sale. I have an allergy to red peppers and informed the cashier of this. He replied that the chicken only had salt and black pepper. When I received my chicken, there was red seasoning on it. Turns out the cashier had been told there was paprika on it and decided to lie to my face! On top of that, he was extremely rude and even got upset with me when I pointed this out to him. The manager saw this happen and did nothing by the way. I received no refund and no apology despite the fact that if I would have taken a bite, I would have ended up in the Emergency Room. I will not be returning to this establishment again and I would like to caution those with allergies as the staff does not care about anyone's well being. I would give this negative stars if I could",

Was pretty much stuffed when I left. Had iced tea to drink. Thankfully they have Sweet & Low as I don't like the other sweeteners most places are using now. Will definitely be back again for some more chicken.",

Here are my ratings for their service:  Customer Service - 5 Stars Chicken Pasta - 1 Star (only because the chicken wasn't burnt) Mashed Potatoes - 1/2 Star (only for the effort)  I ordered the family 4 meal and it was terrible.  I was hoping to write a good review, but the chicken pasta was soaked in thousand island dressing.  Not a huge fan of thousand island sauce unless i can use it on my \"In & Out\" burger.    Mashed Potatoes? Sooooooo disappointed, they covered my mashed potatoes with gravy for me so when i got home it had all blended in together.  Husband was not happy.    Chicken was very bland in seasoning, but thanks to the charred areas, there was a burnt taste at least.    I wish I could say more about the place, but unfortunately \"this is all she wrote\".",

I've had the chicken, ribs, salads, and slaw, though, and their cole-slaw is my favorite in the city. (It's what keeps me coming back, along with the service, honesty).   The chicken and ribs are both tender, juicy and flavorful, even without sauce, which is great in keto and low carb diet world. Add as much or as little as you like? Yes please. The chicken is similar to a \"step above\" something like el Pollo Loco, but the price reflects that as well. Ribs are nibbly and porky and make it feel like not just another low carb chicken meal.  The staff have always been incredibly polite and friendly to me when I visit, and the food comes out fast, making it ideal for takeout or lunch in a hurry.  It's nothing over the moon spectacular, but when you just don't want to cook, or seem like a prick for ordering weird shit, you can totally got keto at NCC.",

The place was slamming packed at noon on a Saturday so I figured that's a good sign.  I Had the whole cut chicken with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese to go.  ...Chicken was on the dry side which has been mentioned in a lot of reviews...so I almost kind of expected it. It did have a nice flavor though...maybe they intentionally overcook the chicken due to fear from a salmonella outbreak and don't want to end up closed like Fire Fly.   ***The fact that you can get an equally delicious full roasted chicken hot and fresh from Walmart, Smith's, Sam's Club, etc...for like $6...take it home and have it hot and MOIST is where I really struggle to find the value in the meal I ate had I not had the discount. $21.50 for dry chicken...I would have been pissed without the $10 off.  The macaroni and cheese was average but the mashed potatoes were really good. They still had bits of the red peel from the potato and it was flavored well with a delicious gravy...that was probably the highlight of the meal.   They included 2 tortilla skins and I couldn't figure out what I was to do with them. I know Pollo Tropical has the salsa bar to go with the tortilla but when I waited for my order I sat in front of the TV and watched some NBA playoffs...perhaps it was in the back and I didn't notice.   I ended up making one mashed potato and chicken breast burrito which I don't think I'll ever repeat again...didn't seem to work.",

I know the hour was late but if your business advertises that it's open until a specific hour, then it should still serve you or have some options available to customers.

And I also have to mention they have hand wipes to clean your face and hands after your meal. These are not HUGE portions , but they are normal portions .  There is plenty of parking , they have outdoor seating , the bathroom was clean .  The interior of the restaurant was clean but looks extremely dated . It needs a serious style update.

I put an order with a UberEats. In the course of my order, there were three different drivers assigned to pick it up, none of whom did ever pick up the order, and my order was canceled after the third one did not pick it up. At this point, an hour after I ordered and long after the \"no later than\" time provided by the app, the restaurant had closed. I spent over an hour waiting for food never came. No communication, no explanation, no dinner.   There are plenty of other roast chicken restaurants in this town, I would suggest using any one of them.",

The 3 stars is for the customer service very mediocre but that's not what bothered me, what did bother me is they were pushing raw chicken through the dining area to another prep area didn't that was allowed by health codes!   Also the price is a little steep 11.50 for chicken avocado wrap!   I probably still come because of the great chicken though!",

It can be busy during lunch time but it's worth waiting in line. You can smell the chicken cooking on the grill from outside the restaurant. It great bbq chicken! They have tasty sides like Mac and cheese,wedges,salads and fries! My bf and I never change what we order here! The avocado chicken wrap with a side of Mac n cheese for me and a pulled pork sandwich for him. The hot sauce they have by the salad counter  is the best salsa ever. They have a lot of sauces on the table and you will want to try all of them. Everything here is great and I always think of that wrap from time to time. They have outside seating as well as booths and tables inside! Definitely get down here!",

We selected, cinnamon sweet potatoes, saffron rice, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes w/gravy as our sides. They all were absolutely delicious!  We also loaded up on sauces from their self serve bar and they are tasty!!! That blueberry bbq sauce is yummy!  The chicken was juicy and hot!

As I entered an employee was on break in one of the booths enjoying some fine Ribs.  (They are the best!).  I said hello, he acted as if I was not there. Another employee was a few feet away as I walked in, getting a soda from the soda fountain. I said hello to him as well and was ignored by your staff for the second time in 15 seconds.I walked up to order and Mr. Beverage walked past without a word of recognition as I stood at the counter waiting to order some of those great ribs.  Finally a young lady in the back saw me waiting to order some of the best BBQ in town and started walking to the counter and...walked right by the register and then right by me without even a smile or a hint of recognition that a paying guest was in the building.  I had a fairly large order I wanted to place, around $200. I waited 3 more minutes and walked out. It was clear that I was an inconvenience to them.  Stay away if you want to feel they value you as much as your money....since they didn't seem to want to serve me it's likely they don't value your money either. I bet the owner does though.",

She said what did you order, I told her and she couldn't find my ticket. She said it's going to 15 min. No ma'am I told her I can't wait another 15 min , I'm on my lunch break. I asked her to cancel my order. She said oh well I will just make it. She threw it together (literally) and handed me my plate... the order was wrong.

So pulled pork wrap minus coleslaw it was cooked great great flavor to the pork. I also had mashed potatoes & gravy mac & cheese & baked beans the worst probably the mashed potatoes & gravy just didn't have it & wasn't warm or hot. The mac & cheese however was creamy & delicious. Baked beans were hot & nice flavor... Drink was pepsi . i will be back.overall it was good.",

If a place really brings it when it makes chicken, it counts as a veritable \"chicken joint.\" You will know immediately that this is a bona fide chicken joint because when you arrive you will smell the delicious smells wafting through the air from the cookers/smokers outside on the patio.  If you get close, you will see fine thighs, legs, and breasts (and not from a strip joint--badda bing) splayed out on the grill.  It's a little unorthodox and unsanitary looking to be honest, because they are practically on the street, and in the parking lot.  But whatever.  It's cooked well, and you are in Las Vegas, so you are not afraid to live on the edge.  Chicken comes in quarters, roasted, and/or barbecued.  You can get beans (smoky and rich), or other sides that I don't remember because the beans erase other sides from memory! The chicken is tender and simply flavored.  You really get the point that chicken is the star.  Not artificial seasonings or doodads.   Parking is really dicey.  And the experience of eating here leaves a lot to be desired.  The tables are wobbly, not always clean, too small, and too close together.  There is no table service.  And the service and hospitality are wildly inconsistent.  Take your chicken to go.",

The consistency is the key because you know the quality is always there and you don't have to think twice. Too many places have different cooks and its hit or miss. The chicken is amazing the pulled pork sandwich is very nice as well. Go in grab a half chicken with honey mustard sauce and let me know what you think.",

Chicken Cafe chicken specifically, duh. I'm a vegetarian, I mean like depending on the day and how melodramatic I feel like being. So if a sometimes vegetarian loves this chicken enough to not call in sick to work then, my friends, you will love it too. The wraps are the best I've ever had. I feel like this place has a cult following because it's always so packed. Such a strange mix of people from business men in suits to call girls in call girl glitter attire. Chicken Cafe brings everyone together. They're just, ya know, saving the world , one rotisserie chicken at a time. I give them props and I give them my lunch money three days a week.

I was served by the owner Nico he was very nice and very articulate when it came to making sure that the way the items were served was artistically set in a certain way. I was starving I have no problem eating the entire meal down... they definitely have a different better product to offer than other chicken places did I mention they had ribs too? the ribs were awesome.. I will be back for more I would definitely love to fit them into a weekly meal if I passed by the one of the locations you can guarantee it thanks for the quick awesome service and the fabulous food Trish Kerr ATI",

The other half feels like I'm missing pieces.

Total bill with tax was $17.59 what a BIG difference.  Everything I received was just OK, nothing specIal.  I did ask the cashier about the difference was told that the menu pricing as posted online was incorrect.  Do not believe I will return, can buy a whole chicken at Costco for half the price.",

I've seen the BBQ going many times before while driving by but I just never stopped before. I arrived at probably the worst time, lunch. They handle the crowd really well but unfortunately they were out of ribs at the moment. No complaints from me however, they said it would be a 15-20 minute wait for more which was not a problem since I wasn't on a set time limit and the manager was very nice and gave us free salads for waiting. The salads are very fresh and I like the open kitchen. The atmosphere was very quaint and I really enjyed hte outdoor seating. I wish the outdoor seating would have been a little cleaner but I'll give them this one since this time of year is pretty unpredictable. When we got our ribs, they were perfect, a nice chew not overdone but not falling apart. I liked how they had a self-serve condiment stand which everything was made fresh; garlic ranch, hot sauce, bbq sauce. The mac and cheese was awesome, I love gooey mac and cheese and the combination of cheese they use was great. I don't advise the Spinach Feta Pasta though, it was pretty bland but anything can be great with ranch or hot sauce. I'll definitely be going back and recommending to my friends as a nice alternative, something different to try. Oh yeah, and they deliver, do carry-out and catering. Don't forget to grab a punch card.",

My problem, however, is the sides.  Oh sweet chicken cafe...mac & cheese should not be fluorescent orange...and corn grows from the ground...not out of cans.   Seriously...if I dined in, I would've traded them in as a previous yelper mentioned they did.  I was not that lucky.  I imagine this would be what it would feel like to have pork rinds with sushi.

I ordered  the 3 dark chicken plate with one side and  an additional 2 sides, he than gave me my cups. When I went to fill my drinks there was no ice and the Coke was out. So I kindly asked him if he could fill/replace my request and  with an attitude said \"ill be right over there okay!\" Blown away by the response and tone he directed towards me I patiently waited. Customers waiting in line behind us have already  got there food and I ask another employee if she could kindly change the Coke and said says \" okay\". 20 minutes later for 3 pieces of chicken and 3 sides the woman brings us our food outside and I ask her if we could have another set of silverware. With a very nasty attitude she said \" uh huh\". I still do not have my Coke. So I look down at my plate and I only see 2 pieces of chicken. I go to the counter and ask for another set of silverware and let him know my order is incomplete and he finally tells me the Coke is out to just grab one from the  fridge. He  follows me to our table to point out that the chicken was not cut, making it still a 3 piece meal. Portion wise to me there was only 2 but I guess he's the chicken expert. Fed up I take my plate to the counter and ask for a refund of my meal. He hands me my money for just the 3 piece and I walk back to our table and notice my sister no longer wants to eat there if only she was going to eat. We than walk up to the counter again and finally ask for a full refund. He grabs her sided lunges them in the garbage can. Pretty much I didn't want to eat there from the beginning and now I really have a reason to never go there again. What really got me was that an employee could be soo rude to a customer. I am in the hospitality industry and behavior like that left me speechless and left with a terrible experience. I left hungry, didn't get refunded my full amount and most importantly wasted my time at that establishment.",

So to be handed a plate of juicy, meaty, DRY-RUBBED ribs roasted right outside in (or very near) the parking lot and Sahara Avenue, well that blew me away. The chicken was alright too, but I will say not as good as EPL. But to be fair, EPL, corporate machine or not, has the best chicken around. The meal, which was over 12 bucks for a few ribs and a piece of chicken, came with a salad and a side. I got the beans. Yum.  I would come here again, but I'd have a coupon to offset the price, and I'd stick to the ribs. I love that It's a little local shop, and hope they can take into consideration the fact that not everybody can drop $12 bucks on lunch. You'd think with the Sahara and Decatur El Pollo Loco just minutes away, they'd at least try to be a little more price-competitive.  If I had to choose, I'd go to EPL every time and have money left over to go across the street to the other corporate giant for a Orange Mocha Frappaccino for desert.",

We got mixed fruits, corn, mac n cheese, and caesar salad. The corn was straight from the can, they only added step was to warm it up. The mac n cheese was ok - tasted like it was made from the box. Two good things about this place, good serving size and garlic ranch. Thank goodness I bought the yelp deal, I would have totally regretted it if I paid for the food full price.

    "text": "Let me start this out with the fact that I almost NEVER write reviews..... but this has compelled me to begin. Since opening I have been going to the Nevada chicken cafe about 2-3 times a month. The food is always fresh and the ingredients are proudly displayed. The staff is friendly, food delicious and service is usually reasonable and within expectations even during busy times. Unfortunately this is where my review of the establishment ends and my candid review of a specific individual begins. This business appears to be family owned. The owner or possibly general manager a gentleman in his late 40's early 50's short hair greying in color is easily spotted. He and he alone is the cause of myself never spending another dollar at the establishment again. This individual has zero professionalism managing employees. On many occasions he can be seen degrading his kitchen staff with extremely rude remarks. He yells, slams things on the counter and pretty much acts like Gordon Ramsey on steroids. Let me tell you something you are not on TV. Intimidation and humiliation are NOT how employees should be treated. If someone (or most staff in this persons eyes) is underperforming one  should stop and look at the quality of leadership first. Have you empowered your staff with the adequate knowledge to excel in there duties? Try some positive reinforcement for a change. The final straw for me was on 4/2/15. I want to have a very late lunch with my boss at around 5:15pm. As usual service was excellent and the food was wonderful. Mr. Owner walks in and immediately starts reprimanding his staff  over what seems to be petty items. Using choice phrases as \"are you stupid\" and \"you must be an idiot\". Upon completion of my meal as I'm walking outside. What to I see (not to my surprise) Mr. Owner sitting on the patio booth, ice cold beer in hand sitting across one of his staff members loudly shouting at him regarding some sort of matter. This was just unprofessional and a disgraceful display of character. For this reason and this reason only I cannot support someone who feels THIS is how to run a business. May I suggest a future more fitting career change, prison guard.",

The side broccoli and pasta was spoiled. I had to throw it out. I don't recommend this place for a family last minute gathering. Next time we'll just BBQ ourselves.",

I ordered online for delivery, however after I hit order, it doesn't give you a confirmation or anything just takes you back to the home screen. So I thought it didn't go through. Same thing. So I let it be and assumed I wasn't eating there today. Sure enough the delivery guy, who was completely monotone and I'm pretty sure high out of his mind, walks in with not one.. But the two orders that I never got a confirmation for. So now I have 40 dollars worth of 2 of the exact same meals delivered to me, when there should only be one.   I really enjoyed the food even though half of it will be tossed and was a complete waste due to a crappy online system. I'll eat here again but will go pick it up myself so I'm not screwed out of 25 dollars.",

    "text": "Got a $5 coupon & decided to check it out. Could smell the meat cooking from outside and the aromas made my mouth water.   I wasn't in the mood for ribs even though that's what everyone told me to get. I saw a lot of people on yelp say chicken was dry...they offer grilled or rotisserie. I asked the girl at the counter what was best for juicy. She said the rotisserie was juicier because skin holds in moisture better. Sounded good to me so hubby and I ordered 1/2 chicken, paid $3 more for white meat. Added three sides for $8 - Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes gravy and black beans. With coupon total was $11.99.  Delivered to our table in less than five min. Chicken was hot & juicy and cooked to perfection. Sauce choices were limited to two: BBQ or hot. Tried BBQ which was just okay. Sides were hot and tasted good. Mashed potatoes had skins in it and gravy was okay so I probably won't order again. If you like white mild cheese then you will love the macaroni n cheese ( I'm a sharp cheddar girl myself). Black beans were excellent! Our meal came with two warm tortillas and a small vinaigrette salad which was a nice surprise.  I am giving this review four stars today subject to change based on my next visit. It is clean, cute, TVs are a nice touch. I hope the owner adds more sauce and spice choices easily ready at tables. I look forward to ribs, broccoli salad and pulled pork sandwiches in my future here. It's way better than fast food. Suggestion: go with a coupon and give it a chance...",

    "text": "Yum, yum, yum! So glad I listened to my fellow yelper Jamie P's review and went here. Amazing food, great service and freshness make the Nevada Chicken Cafe the clear choice in bbq for this area of Vegas.   My husband and I shared the 1/4 white meat chicken which is a wing and breast. We also got the 1/4 of ribs and a side of Mac and cheese and baked beans. I love that they have their own bottles of bbq sauce and hot sauce. Also, for you ranch lovers out there they also have garlic ranch!! Score!! Our meal came with side salads that had their own vinaigrette that was very tangy, but tasty. The chicken was tender & moist and do flavorful. Wow! The ribs! Normally I can't do ribs, but these melted in my mouth and were not greasy at all!! I was very impressed with the Mac and cheese. It was super cheesy and not full of just american cheese. Definitely not from the box. The baked beans were also full of flavor and bbq goodness. Plus, not overly sweet like some places.  The staff was so friendly and patience with us while we were deciding on what to order. I love that you can watch them cook the ribs on the spit. It makes the place smell amazing. The scent can literally draw you in from off the street or if you are just driving by.  I wish I lived closer because I'd be here every week! I can't wait to hit this place up again for more ribs and chicken.",

I have to agree with some of the other posters that the smoke flavor on the chicken is not really present.  The chicken was tender, but more seasoning and smoke would significantly enhance the flavor.  The BBQ sauce was a bit sweet for my tastes, and it would have been nice to have a choice of sauce.  The mac and cheese was pretty good, 4.5/5 for a quick bite to eat.",

Its impossible to ignore the delicious smell of BBQ chicken cooking as you approach Jones and Sahara, where this gem is tucked away behind the gas station. The cafeteria style set up is perfect for a quick lunch without tempting you to linger. Everything is fresh made onsite, including the BBQ sauce! The staff is quick but friendly and they keep the place clean despite the numerous customers licking sauce from their fingers.  I've only had the chicken, me and pork don't get along...but I hear the ribs are just as good. Not the cheapest place in town, but don't worry. The price you pay is worth it ($13 for 6 wings and 2 sides) and will keep you full.   Don't forget to stop by the condiment bar and grab a couple cups of their sauce...can you tell I adore the sauce?!?!",

I ordered the dark chicken.  It was tasty but nothing spectacular.  With a side, the meal was a little less than $10.  I thought it was too pricey for the quality, but the portions were pretty solid.  You could definitely get away with creating at least one and a half meals, maybe two if you had two sides.

Had to knock a star off for that one, unfortunately...  Besides that confusion, Nevada Chicken Cafe is pretty tasty. Coworker ordered one of the rib + chicken combos and practically inhaled the whole meal in a matter of minutes. My chicken caesar wrap was also good.

Normal gas looking grill, back is surrounded by a brick wall. Lots of outside seating. Inside to the left behind glass you can see someone chopping up raw chicken. Directly in front is what I want to call a tiny salsa bar. It has a cucumber pico salsa, mild salsa, garlic ranch, limes, 3 bottles of BBQ sauce and some bottles of hot sauce. Next to that cart is the soda fountain with Pepsi products. Then it has a line that says enter here. You walk and see on the other side of the glass the sides. You get to the register and order at the end. They give you a number and you sit down.   Our experience: the place was empty except for 2 tables had people there. We go to order and waited 5 minutes for someone to come. Two workers behind the counter were mopping and could care less if we were there. We were about to leave when this guy ceasars from on the tables to help us. Serious? This place needs a class in customer service! We asked about the sides if they were home made. He said yes, and raved how flavorful they were. I got the chicken breast, wing, 1/4 rib combo. Came with a side and a drink. My friend got the dark meat combo and an extra side. Luckily we had a coupon because that was $28. Our coupon brought it down to $21.   The food: no meat on the chicken wing, the chicken breast (attached to the wing still) was small was flavorful tasted like rotisserie chicken. The pork ribs were ok, had a good BBQ roasted flavor.  No BBQ on the meat. I didn't taste a flavor of a spice rub either. So maybe the were salt and peppered. The combos came with a little salad and one flour tortilla. For my side I got mashed potatoes and gravy. There was barely any gravy on the potatoes. But they tasted the best compared to my friend's mac n cheese that had less flavor than Kraft Mac n cheese.  It was really bland and not cheesy. Her other side was potato salad. She said it had way too much onion in it that all she could taste was the onion flavor. The BBQ in the bottles that aren't even marked BBQ are really sweet. You don't get any bold flavor or smokiness.   I might give them a second shot on a salad looks like they have tons of ingredients to choose from.",

    "text": "Experience: I have always wanted to try this place as every time I drive up and down Sahara, I see the grill a smokin.  We were in the area, and I found a coupon in my \"Entertainment\" book. Yes!  It was about 4pm and we were going for a very late lunch/early dinner.   Facility: it's pretty small, only about 5 booths and 5 tables. It was cool you can see where they prepare the chicken and ribs through the window. It's got a fast food feel, but with better food.   Service: You order your food at the counter and the give you a number. They bring it to your table. The guy that helped us was friendly and answered all our questions. However, we stood at the counter a few minutes waiting for him to finish mopping.   Food:  I got the combo with dark meat chicken, ribs, and 1 side for $11.99. The CHICKEN (3.5/5) was good. It had a nice mesquite flavor and the meat was moist. Felt like it was missing something though. I pulled it off, wrapped it in the tortilla, added salsa, pico and some SALAD (4/5) off my plate. I liked that. I loved the PICO (5/5) because it was tart and it had cucumber in it. The SALSA (3/5) was good and spicy.  RIBS (4/5) were good. Again, loved the mesquite flavor. I added the BBQ SAUCE (2.5/5), and not a huge fan. It was just too sweet for me. They need a second sauce that is savory and spicy. I ordered the POTATO SALAD (3/5) that wasn't bad, but not a fan of the onions in it. I got an extra side of MACARONI AND CHEESE (3/5) which was also decent, but needs some salt.   Overall: (3/5) I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. I would come back, but not waiting in a long line. I liked the meat, but the sides were just ok. To me, the best BBQ is good meat and good sides too!!!!  So, this was just ok.",

Chicken was crispy-skin grilled goodness, but a really small portion that fit on 1 tortilla.    The 4 ribs were definitely not smoked on the cool mesquite BBQ they have walled off behind glass to the side -- you can feel the heat coming thru, but not smell the smoke. Well I also couldn't smell any mesquite smoke on my ribs, so I drown 2 of them in sauce and skipped the rest.    The best part of the meal was the oh so creamy warm and loving potato salad. Yum yum yum!   I'd drive here again to get a large side of the potato salad and eat it at home with my own smoked ribs.",

I tried the tomato mozerella chicken sandwich. The cheese/bread/fixings were great, but the chicken was kinda *eh*. No clue if the chicken they use in the sandwiches is reject meat or what!   The sides were where this place really sucked. I was quite psyched about the generous size of them, but then was disappointed when we ended up throwing it mostly away. Fiance got corn and mac & cheese. Corn was ok, mac and cheese was gross. It was really watery.. basically mac sitting in this watery yellow sauce. I was stupid enough to try the spinach feta pasta. I assumed the green pasta meant the pasta itself was spinach pasta. HA. it was white pasta covered in a disgusting spinach sauce. It basically tasted like cold boiled spinach. EW.   I'd try them again, but I'd avoid the mac and cheese and pasta next time!",

I ordered the chicken avocado wrap and I personally do not eat avocado or carrots so I asked for it without avocados or carrots. As I was walking out of the store I looked around and noticed that two of the what I have to assume owners cars were parked directly in front of the restaurant taking up guest parking including a spot that isn't even parking. When I got home sat down to eat and opened my food up I was totally disappointed, they got my order wrong, I was hungry so I started to eat around what I didn't like the chicken was dry and had very little flavor. So I gave the other half of my wrap to my husband who isn't picky at all and he didn't even like it. I definitely will not go back! Not to mention I paid $13 for the wrap and a soda...which is wayyyyy to pricey for the quality.",

Being (sorta) new in town, I am still looking for \"regular\" lunch places for takeout that are delicious but won't make my ass huge.   Unfortunately, Nevada Chicken Cafe doesn't hold a candle to Chicken Dijon. I ordered the chicken cesaer wrap, and the meat was pretty dry and it kind of grossed me out. The whole thing fell apart the second I took it out on my desk so I ate it with a fork-- not very wrap-esque. The tortilla was fresh though, and bonus points for having light dressings for the wraps and salads. Sadly I may not go back, since Subway is just as close.",

    "text": "I drove by this place for ages, always wondering what the food tasted like, and more than a little entranced by their giant inflatable chicken man that would shill on their roof or on the sidewalk next to the chicken cafe.    I'm not going to lie: Every time I drove by, I've secretly hoped that Peter Griffin from \"The Family Guy\" would run out of nowhere, and the two would engage in epic fisticuffs for my own amusement (or to make my time at the stop light go by faster).  Regardless of my dreams unrealized, I decided to break down and actually go into this place.  I'm glad that I did.  You'll see the little man grilling to his heart's content when you first walk up, and he'll cheerfully wave while you smell the chicken and ribs cooking.  The entry door's a little tricky to find (it's at the far left), but inside, it is a veritable mecca of chicken.  And it's good.  The side dishes are no slouch, either, all filled with fresh veggie goodness, and your choice or light or dark meat, chicken or ribs, and it's certainly filling.  The mashed potatoes were especially notable, and while I haven't gone the rib route, the chicken is flavorful.  It's usually around a $10 meal (perhaps a little less), so if on a tight budget, it may not be a \"cheap\" dining alternative.  However, the food is fast, it's grilled right in front of you, and it's tasty.  Now when I drive past, I see the little grill man and the inflatable chicken, and will be tempted to go in at times, and occasionally act on that urge.  While I still wait for my inevitable \"Peter Griffin Vs. Giant Chicken\" fight, at least the food is good enough to pass the time until that eventual reward.",

I just got into Vegas on business this week.. after over 3 years away and yearning for the sensational taste of the Mesquite BBQ Chicken and Ribs.. and my \"custom side dish\" (combination of Sweet Potato and Saffron Rice)... Actually... I found the place has had a full face lift.. with major improvements to the patio, and the parking lot.. AWESOME.. As well as a revised interior seating and ordering area.. all great upgrades that provide an extremely family friendly environment from the seating to the order menus to the well uniformed and informed STAFF... i NOTICED AND REMEMBERED THAT MOST OF THE STAFF ON DUTY WERE THE SAME CREW FROM YEARS AGO!!! That alone speaks for the consistency of the restaurant performance and ownership. New cooking equipment... especially a rotisserie type BBQ for the ribs.. resulted in even MORE JUICY AND TASTY RIBS.  The chicken was well cooked and Juicy at the same time...  The custom side I love so much and have had sooooo many times in the past WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBER IT!!! But don't believe me.. eating is believing.. ride, run or walk over TODAY AND TASTE FOR YOUR SELF... God Bless.. them with many more years of success... Spread the LOVE.. I highly recommend this place....!!!!!",

    "text": "Rex is sentimental...if nothing else. Which of course as you know...makes Rex nothing else. One thing Rex loves is when old friends meet new friends.  Old Friend, sleeping off a bleach/ammonia high in a dumpster...meet New Friend...waking in the dumpster and finding an unused Groupon coupon. The sun was hot. The dumpster, or as I calling my \"mobile home\", was even hotter. The bad thing about \"mobile homes\" is that they are dirty, lumpy and usually smell like Kirstie Alley's bellybutton. The good thing is that sometimes you can meet someone and have a little...rendezvous. Guys...and I guess girls...if you meet a girl in a dumpster...there is a very good chance she is dead or easy...or both. Sometimes you might be tempted to hang in there if you realize that you are sharing it with a hooker who has a hacking cough. Don't. There are plenty of \"mobile homes\" out there.  TB and an empty wallet sucks.  So obviously some rich bastard who has things like a home, indoor plumbing and a vacuum that will vacuum the floors on its own just through out this little piece of gold like he does his underwear with holes in it. (which by the way...found a \"gently\" used pair of underwear. nice.)  Anyway, I was able to purchase 20 dollars of food from the Nevada Chicken Cafe. I started off on my long walk to what could potentially be...chicken nirvana.  I was about 2.3 miles away.  I got there 5 days later. It all started when I tried to walk an old lady across the street...and then...well...lets just say that it went wrong.  I did think that Scottsdale was nice.  When I did arrive at the Nevada Chicken Cafe, a lovely Dutchman pulled me the last 30 miles on a sled. (Long story...but you will always pay your debts to Rex...and Rex knows his Mel's Diner trivia.)  When Rex pulled up he was immediately struck by the smell. It was amazing. They had an outside grill/smoker going on and it was impressive. The chicken, ribs, spices, mesquite, all made me want to go in and order as much as I could.   Rex forced the Dutchman to order one whole chicken, one half chicken, a side of salad and it came with some BBQ sauce and tortillas. The tortillas were gratis. Gracias for the gratis. Rex found an empty mobile home and sat down with my feast. I was starving. Grave robbing is a lot more difficult than you would think. What is even more difficult is finding a landlord that will take a burial dress and skull in lieu of payment. Trust me...in Scottsdale no one has the kind of loot Princess Diana's had...not that Rex would know...anyway...  ...for the equivalent of 21.50 Rex was well fed. Rex fed well for 2 meals.  The chicken was excellent. The mesquite was subtle but flavorful. It didn't overpower the meat and was really good. The BBQ sauce is exceptional. Rex doesn't like an overly sweet sauce and this one isn't. It is well balanced and not too overpowering on the chicken. it works with the plain chicken better than the mesquite rubbed.  Rex was so impressed he has gone back several times and tried the ribs and some other sides.  The baby back ribs are among the best ribs in Las Vegas. They are fall off the bone and the extremely flavorful.  The St. Louis ribs are good, but they aren't great. Rex didn't love that it wasn't sauced enough. The sauce is sweeter and that is fine, but St. Louis ribs should be HEAVILY sauced...and these aren't.   The chicken...well...when done right it is the best. It is a excellent piece of chicken. The problem is that there is no consistency. Rex has had dry pieces and he has had perfect pieces...and this is a MAJOR issue. If you are only doing a few things they have to be perfect. In fairness I have had more good than bad...but I have had enough bad to not necessarily want the crap shoot when I am paying good grave robbing money.   The sides are were everything falls apart.  The Mac and Cheese...and Rex loves the mac and cheese...isn't good. Under seasoned (the only thing that is), and mash potatoes are so peppery it is of the charts. Rex loves pepper. He would roll himself in pepper and find a nice salt covered girl to mix with...but this is too much pepper. The fruit salad wasn't cleaned as well (the tough pieces) as it should be, and the mixed veggies were okay, but nothing great.  The black beans were okay, but again nothing to write home about and didn't taste like they were simmered in a rich enough stock. The sweet potatoes were a real stand out and should be eaten as the side.   A huge special shout out for the garlic ranch sauce...get a few tubs of it. perfect with the chicken and the salad. Amazing taste.   Rex has dated his fair share of unstable women. It adds a little spice. A little mystery. A little arousal. Eventually no matter how good post release from jail sex can be...it is time to go.  In his eateries Rex demands stability. Consistency. Reliability. Excellence. Rex is all of those things and more.  Spend your money and time on a shrine to Rex. He will spend his money on gas and whores.",

There are problems that could easily be corrected and controlled. I am a huge soup lover and they offer a superb chicken veggie soup. No noodles which is perfect for I try to avoid the carbs. First time that I tried the soup it was outstanding, due to in large part on account of the seasoning or spices added to the broth. When I ordered the same soup tonight, the zip was gone. It was good, but not the same as the first time.When I inquired about this a polite young man was unable to answer why this could be. Apparently there is not one person who makes the soup and all apparently prepare it differently. First time really filled with chicken chunks and veggies. Tonight, emphasis on the broth, not the ingredients. My wife ordered among other things corn on the cob. Last time it was perfect, this time salty. Lack of consistency is the result of lack of supervision.Love the ribs.......love the chicken. Great place to go but needs some TLC.Doesn't rate a 5 When the fix the soup it gets a 5.

Chicken was seasoned well, not really juicy, but that was expected because it was grilled on open flame. I had the baby back ribs, they were dry rubbed. Not fall off the bone juicy and tender but they were good. The house dipping sauce was as good as it gets. I couldn't explain it, that was definitely the highlight of the meal. I would go back just to get ribs with that sauce again. I was a little disappointed they ran out of roasted potatoes, so i opted for the saffron rice, instead. It was okay, came with a house spring mix salad, with balsamic dressing and a flour tortilla. With a drink it came out to 10.50$. A fair price. I want to go back and try some other sides, The food presented well, served on a wooden chopping board looking plate, a great touch. It was during lunch rush that I came in, and food came out fast and great tasting. That is a great indicator that the owners are doing something right.",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place again since were not too shabby last time. This time around I had the ribs and chicken combo. The ribs were meaty and well seasoned but a little dry, I'm thinking cause it comes off the grill and into a pan waiting for customers. The chicken this time was better nice and hot, juicy and the smokey flavor was good. I'm not sure why I don't come here more often but I should. Its not bad for the money.",
