I ate here several times during my stint in Las Vegas, but I must admit to me it did not hit the spot.  The sauce was horrible, reminded me more of spaghetti O's and not authentic Mexican food. The service is good for the most part, depending on the demand of the customers, there could be some serious waiting on a refill of coke.  I do not think there is much else I can say about this place at this time, I am giving three stars based on my experiences, and the food.",

    "text": "I've been to Casa Don Juan at least a dozen times, and I've never had a bad meal. And I've never had to wait more than a half hour for it. (And that's pushing it.) This place is fast! And delicious!  When I moved here from Texas 16 years ago, I wanted to find a great Mexican restaurant. But everything was on the California-Mexican side of things (lots of cilantro, mango, and crap like that). And then I found Casa Don Juan. I'm not saying this place is True Tex-Mex, but it sure is good. It's my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, and that's saying something.  From the homey bean dip they give you with your chips to the homemade tortillas, this place is legit. And they sure love them some Frida Kahlo. (Look around; you'll see what I mean.) But on to the food...  As I said, I've been here a lot and usually get the traditional fare (tacos, burritos, chile rellenos). Tonight the spouse and I decided to try something different: he got the tongue, and I got the chicken mole. I'm not a big fan of organ meat, but I liked the tomatilla sauce on my husband's tongue (THAT sounds wrong!), and the important thing is that he loved it. My mole was delicious; one of the best sauces I've had.  Our waiter was great, and it was nice that we could use a Groupon for most of the meal. Even without a coupon, I would (and will) come back to Casa Don Juan. I've had their fish and chilaquiles, but there's still plenty of other menu options I need to try!",

    "text": "I've heard about this place from pretty much all my friends at some point, so I decided to finally check it out. Super easy to find and the building has a fun, comfy atmosphere. There's not too much parking right near the restaurant, but plenty within walking distance.  We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and led to our table. The hostess immediately asked us if we wanted either cheese dip (which I've heard is amazing) or guacamole with our chips and salsa (including bean dip). Being that my friend and I don't respond well to dairy, we opted for the guac. The hostess informed us that it was extra, which we said was fine. Had I known it was almost $6 more, I think I would've said no... super yummy guac, but not worth an extra $6. My friend prefers her guac with more seasoning and additional ingredients, so she thought it was just ok. I love plain guac, so I thought it was delicious. The bean dip was just ok. But I've been spoiled by Leticia's (north side of town) AMAZING bean dip.  Our server was great and attentive. He recommended the pina colada and checked to see the ingredients for us. The pina colada was delicious and just a fun experience! Brought out in a pineapple instead of a glass! For my entree, I had the one taco meal with carne asada meat. The taco meal was good, but not amazing. Came with beans and spanish rice.  Overall, fun experience and good (not amazing) food. I kind of left feeling like I could've gone to a Mexican fast food place near my house for more food and way cheaper. Or made the drive all the way to Leticia's. Would go again to try a different dish.",

I got the chicken tacos-no lettuce, no beans. Mom got two enchiladas and my aunt went with the chicken flautas. I absolutely devoured my entire plate of food. The tortilla was perfect, and my taco didn't fall apart. The guac was fresh and delicious, making it the perfect addition to chips as well as my taco. My Mom and aunt both had a bit of food left over, but agreed that it was a good meal with excellent service. The bonus is they have pretty ample private parking for a downtown restaurant (which was a big part of our reasoning in going there). The service, food, and atmosphere were awesome. We were offered a free souvenir picture which, as a local, kind of made me chuckle. We will definitely be back!",

The guac is def fresh, the cheese dip is a meal in itself and its always difficult to save room for the amazing fried ice cream.

    "text": "The food is great! But the service is sub-par (super friendly, but SLOW), and it's a bit more pricey than it's worth (their prices have gone up in the last year). I will not be going back after tonight. My chimichanga was supposed to come with sour cream -- there was less than a tablespoon's worth on the plate, whereas there was probably 3-4 times as much guacamole on the plate. I'd expect a relatively equal amount of sour cream. I pointed this out to both the server and the server assistant and asked for a little bit more (and it took far too long to actually get more sour cream).  I got charged for the sour cream ($1.50), so I asked for it to be removed when I went to pay at the counter. The manager asked \"what was wrong with the sour cream\" and I repeated my complaint and said that I didn't ask for nor need the 1/2 cup of sour cream that they brought me. I just wanted what ought to have come with my dinner.  The manager ended up taking off 1/2 of the cost. So I still paid .75 cents. Now, I know it's that much money, and that wasn't the point of asking for it to be taken off. It's the principle of the thing. I paid $15.99 for a chimichanga that was supposed to come with beans, rice, guacamole, and sour cream. I don't think it's too much to ask to get more than a micro-dollop of sour cream. Had my meal not come with sour cream, I would have ordered it and happily paid the $1.50.  I was not expecting an attitude from the manager over $1.50, especially when I had a $95 bill. (If I was going to complain and lie about something, I would have complained about something worth more money.) What's more, when a server came up to the counter (not my server), she asked him in Spanish if he'd \"served that girl sour cream.\" Like I was lying or something? (And like this white girl can't possibly understand Spanish.) I rarely ask for a bill adjustment, having been a server for so many years, but I've never gotten a rude pushback like this before over a measly buck fifty. To me, that says a lot about how they do business, and I for one don't appreciate it. We won't be back.",

The margs were great--healthy mix of fresh juice, mix and tequila.  They went down easy and were reasonably priced.  In Vegas that's under 10 bucks!    We went back for breakfast.  And I'd give them 4 stars for it.  Potato burrito was tasty and she had potato tacos with eggs.  Taters a little under done.  Would like it spicier next time.",

    "text": "We originally came in to this restaurant on a groupon.  We enjoyed their margaritas, as well as the queso dip that comes with the chips, something that many other Mexican restaurants don't offer.  Went in there tonight.  Started out with the chips, and right away we were informed that they did not have the queso dip, and it would take too long for us to get some.  Strange that they would be out of queso dip at 530 PM, but OK, they brought us the chips with their (as other reviews have stated) lard-based bean dip and a watery, uninteresting salsa.  My wife asked for a spicier salsa, and they brought out a coffee-cup sized serving of some reddish-orange fluid, which to her had at least a little more taste.  The meal was certainly passable....I enjoyed my carne asada enchiladas, and the carnitas de puerco con guacamole was OK as well.  When the bill came, the total was $63 for three people, including soft drinks and upcharges for guacamole (I get it) and spicy salsa (really!).  I guess if I had read Sella G's unsatisfactory review of this restaurant from August 6, I might have known.....but since I had been here a few times, and usually order queso dip, I had no idea that they were charging for salsa (that you have to ask for after first receiving bland, watery stuff at no additional charge).  You know when something annoys you, but you might not make a big deal about it?  That's kind of how I felt when I went to pay (at Casa Don Juan, the waitstaff does not take your money, but you are expected to go line up at the cash register to pay).  I handed the lady behind the counter a $100 bill and my ticket, which she took.  Then, without looking up, she says 'And how was everything?'  If you  are going to ask that question, then I figure you want to know that I am leaving the restaurant annoyed, so I mention the thing about the salsa.   She says 'hold on, let me get the manager'.  She doesn't see the manager, and says (in a worried tone) 'wait, don't leave'.  Well of course I'm not going to leave....she has my $100 bill in her hand, and I haven't got change....and whether or not they adjust the bill, I will still need change.    So the manager gets there.  I tell her about the salsa, and told her that I did not know there was a charge'.  Her response was that she saw my wife ask for it, and yes, there is a charge.  She has the power, and she is \"right\"....and the restaurant will be charging me for the salsa.  In that moment, I let her know that I would never return, and would be posting my experience on social media.  She didn't even look at me, and told the lady at the cash register to charge me the full bill.  I didn't expect that tonight was my last visit ever to Casa Don Juan, but it seems to have worked out that way.  I guess the by-product of this is that it got me to sign up for Yelp!, which I had never done before, and write my first review.  And while I have introduced this restaurant to others that I know, it will be an interesting exercise for me to see how many people I can convince to avoid this restaurant.  As for paying for the salsa, I only 'sort of' apologize to the wait staff that it was deducted from what I would consider a normal tip, but they participated in this by either inadvertently not telling us there was an upcharge when we asked for spicier salsa or by knowingly not telling us of this upcharge and hoping that we wouldn't notice or care when the bill came.  Either way, I'm not too worked up that they were tipped a little less, and I am comfortable that I didn't end up bearing any of the cost that was intended to accompany the combined lack of communication and snitty attitude.    Memo to the management  it's worse to ask someone if they're satisfied if you aren't going to care.  Good luck collecting $3 annoyance charges to people who don't know they are incurring them.  You took a little money that would have been given to your wait staff, and you now have not only a former customer, but someone who will actively encourage others to avoid your restaurant.",

The michelada was watered down - not a great tomato mix at all which is the base for a great drink since the only mixer is beer from a bottle.  The guacamole was awful.  We ordered it and it came out in less than a minute so you know it was pre-batched (which is fine, it didn't specify table side or fresh) but it was so bland.  It appeared to be just smashed up avocado.  No other spices or ingredients at all.    When the chips are the most flavorful item among a michelada and guacamole, there's a problem.  We didn't even order a main dish we were so disappointed with our initial course.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas (and I'm a local lol). This excludes quick Mexican food like Tacos el Gordo and taco trucks because this place is more of a sit-down restaurant with servers, not quick food like Tacos el Gordo (which is amazing). The chips and salsa also come with refried beans for dipping which is a favorite of mine. I never see restaurants do this except Lorena'a. Very nice touch! I had the chicken enchiladas that came with rice and beans. AMAZING. Tasted very homemade, very authentic and the portion was generous. I also had the mango margarita and the watermelon margarita (don't judge me). Both blended and both were the perfect balance. Sweetness mixed with tart. The tequila was not cheap tasting nor was it weak nor too strong for enjoyment. Just perfect! Also they let you choose between their house tequila and more premium tequila brands. I picked the house tequila to save the 2 bucks and was a little skeptical but no complaints whatsoever.   The bar area has some sort of specials during playoff games, I believe. I don't remember the details but if you come sit at the bar during a playoff game, any sport I think, some appetizers are a few bucks cheaper which is cool. Definitely call ahead for details as I don't remember it exactly but that was a cool thing to see. Nice and convenient for when you want to catch an important game and not get stuck elbow to elbow at a BWW.  Great spot! Will definitely be hack! I miss it already, lol.",

We were seated promptly in a quiet area, yay, but then we sat there for upwards of 30 minutes waiting to be greeted and to order our drinks. We had to flag someone down to find out who was serving us. The table immediately next to us was helped many times during the wait. It was not very busy at all when we arrived and still not very busy when we left.   When we finally ordered I got the beef flautas and it was really disappointing, they were not flautas, they were skinny basic taquitos. Not to dissimilar from the ones you can buy in the frozen food section. I got the mango margarita blended and it was good, nice flavor. The chips and the dips that came out were very good.  I've been to both locations in Las Vegas and this location was truly a let down. Service was not great, and the food was mediocre. I'm glad we used a Groupon but I will not come back to this location again.",

My favorite dishes include the Chile's rellenos, the lengua en salsa verde, and the quest dip!! And don't forget to try the homemade tortillas!   PS- Parking can be kinda weird, but not impossible start on the northwest corner of the street for best parking and then move your way west. Enjoy!",

This place was just somewhere we stumbled upon because we were hungry before a YEE that was happening across the street & I needed to eat something before the event since there wasn't food other than hot dogs which are like one of my least favorite foods. The inside seems like an authentic back in the days Mexican restaurant. Whole bunch of COLORFUL decorations everywhere w/ stuff hanging all over the ceilings.  . We sat at the bar since we were going to be quick & we just kept sitting at the bar ever since. There is this one guy bartender that we love w/ his Hispanic accent he is quick & funny & attentive just right. Forgot his name... =/  we didn't really explore to much into the menu &  just ordered what we were craving at the moment.  CHIPS W/ SALSA & BEAN DIP $0 - AHHHH this is the best kind of complimentary chips & salsa bean dip that we have tasted. i dunno what they use in their been dip but it is just SO addicting!!! literally makes you want to order a whole bowl and put it on EVERYTHING  CHICKEN W/ GREEN SAUCE TAMALES $3.75 - the chicken was nice & tender. could have possibly used a little more seasoning but i just added some of the complimentary salsa & bean dip.  CHEESE W/ JALAPENOS $3.75 - this was cheesy oooo eee goooeyy yummyness & it was warm & just perfectly made  TOSTADAS CAMARON $7.75 - this dish was freaken AWSOME! SO much freaken shrimp for a little taco. Definitely had to use some of the complimentary chips to eat the rest of the shrimp. The shrimp was chopped up w/ some veggies mixed w/ citrus & topped off w/ avocado.  Definitely will be coming back every time we want some margaritas & tamales & tostadas!! .",

    "text": "I know after 700 plus reviews....what else can someone add? Well here we go. LOL!! Apparently Casa Don Juan not only has ton of reviews but friend told me second oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Really? I can tell you from the minute you open the door OMG not only does this place scream personality but the interior design is old school. Not even mentioning the fact the restaurant is located in downtown area that shady more so in the evening. They do have other business around and part of the whole revitalizing downtown scene.   I came for early dinner with friends. It was my first time. Like mention before walk in the HH hour margarita menu board right outside next to the door screams personality. Not only from the day of the dead art on chalkboard but all the different flavor margaritas in different color. Once step foot inside there so much random stuff going on not sure what stood out more for me. The day of the dead characters on shelf, the history of Casa Don Juan, the photos, and even have zoltar but instead of your normal character you have Casa Don Juan herself. Kind of creepy. My opinion. They two separate dining areas and bar area (they have machines at the bar area). The waitstaff outfit got personality.   The menu...swear by far one of the biggest menus seen in Mexican restaurant. It was like seven different pages. I had hard time figuring out should get the first time. Thankfully Yelp family pushing the fresh guacamole. We ordered that for appetizer or starter with the chips and salsa. The guacamole was awesome. It talked refreshing, fresh, the color tell used perfect ripe avocado nice green, and had nice seasonings. Definitely dish would recommend! My entree went with two tamales. Not often order tamales and not sure other Mexican restaurants if standard menu item. Whatever the case I got one chicken with green salsa and one pork with red sauce. The dish came with rice and beans. The tamales were amaZing. Everything was was point from the wrapping and once open it up jaw dropping. Nice hot, moist, and the fillings on both were hell of tasty and the sauce. I would say some of the best tamales every had in life. Each one was nice size. The rice and beans was solid. All the food is very reasonable price but honesty Mexican food not that expensive. The thing that stands out Casa Don Juan they say authentic Mexican food and it REALLY is authentic. They have lot of the traditional dishes that also on the menu. They also get best of las vegas awards. So 700 plus reviews and awards later Casa Don Juan Restaurant had truly stood the test of time. Happy that my friends suggested going here for dinner.   The service was nothing but five stars. The hostess to our waiter they were on it the whole night.",

The menu alone is just as fun with many delicious offerings.  They start us off with our drinks and chips, salsa and some refried beans!  Our meal came out much quicker than anticipated!

They always start you off with fresh tortilla chips and the bean and salsa dip. We didn't have the guacamole this time, but I have tried it and boy is it delicious. I've never tried Huevos Rancheros before so I decided to give it a go. I was overall pleased with how it tasted. Eggs made over medium correctly and the rice and beans were super tasty. I've also tried their fajitas which were awesome, the meat was cooked perfectly and I loved the 'grilled' veggies that come on the hot platter.  They do make their tortillas fresh there, usually when I come in I see the lady making them. The place usually gets really warm and I can slightly feel the cool breeze blowing, but not enough to bother me. The service was 'OK' she came by a few times and checked on us, but took a while to grab our check. I do enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Location is very close to my house so I don't see myself not coming here.",

We each had a different entree .  The food all seems to pretty much look the same no mater what you order , and tastes unlike any other Mexican food I have ever  eaten .  Please avoid this restaurant unless you want to take a big chance on getting sick .  Consider yourself warned !!!!

Wasn't long to for us to be seated and our waiter Ivan introduced himself with a big smile then quickly begin serving. We got guacamole to start off with your chips and salsa dawn good. But more than anything I could smell the hand made  tortillas being made in the back. We got our food and again our lunch. Absolutely great. Ordered two sides of flour tortillas which did not last long and ordered another to go. Authentic Mexican food is what they have here. Good job Ivan keep up the good work.",

    "text": "I was hoping that I did not have to write a review about Casa Don Juan as two stars but I have to be completely honest in my rating.  We were in the neighborhood and decided to give them a shot during the \"Cinco de Mayo\" celebrations.  They were planning three days of festivites 3rd-5th we decided on the kickoff party on Sunday.  How disappointing this visit was.    The staff the greeted us right away and we were seated shortly.  This is where the service took a turn for the worst.  It took several minutes for someone to greet us at the table and get the beverages ordered.  We decided on a couple of margarita's one on the rocks and one blended.  On the rocks is my preference but my lady friend had the blended and you could not taste the tequila or sweet and sour in that one.  The blended was not the best tasting drink I have had very watery and lacked flavor besides the salted rim.     Now the big fiasco starts during the order process.  We were looking for a veggie burrito which they had on the menu for $8.00 or so but the server said No! you should order the number 35 which was $13.99.  We needed a build your own burrito with beans, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guac wrapped in a tortilla.  Easy right?? Well, I had to repeat myself about SIX times to ensure it would come out correctly and even then it did not.  Beans were served on the side with rice and the tortilla was filled with lettuce, cheese and sour cream only. Not sure what happened??? I brought it to there attention and all I got was Sorry! That's it. WTF?  My Enchilladas were ok.  I had the order of 3 and went with one of each of beef, chicken and cheese.   I opted for both green and red sauce on top. one was supposed to be spicier than the other but I could not tell.  The kids share the nacho order but for $6.99 and made incorrectly than requested.  We recieved a plate full of tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, and sour cream.  No tomato or guac as requested but the meat was on the side which was correct.    The food was completely ordinary.  Nothing memorable at all.  what was memorable was the service or lack there of.  Slow throughout the entire dining experience.  What was more of a concern was the lack of enthusiam on the employees faces.  I did not see anyone besides the host smiling.  The bar tenders both the male and female looked as if they were mean as junk yard dogs. Very unwelcoming.   This is supposed to be a \"Cinco De Mayo\" Celebration and none of the staff looked like they were having fun or were even interested in working Sunday.  What a shame.  The first impression of Casa Don Juan was not a great one and we will not likely be back anytime soon.",

Others had carnitas; I tasted the dish, but it was too salty for me.  Cadillac margaritas were very good.   A lot of dishes under $10 bucks, but majority of us had $11 - $15 dishes.  For eleven of us with tax and tip was about $275.00 (not a bad deal considering 6 beers, 5 Cadillacs and desserts).",

Don't understand why.  He was so rude and when we left decided to talk to manager same as rude and we were asked where we were from??

    "text": "I don't know if this place changed ownership in the last two yrs but it sure has changed....for the worst.  I do like the decor and the dress of servers. I like the story of Frieda on the wall. It encourged me to watch a movie about her, which was very good. I found this place about 2 1/2 yrs ago. Way across town from where I live but I went there for the ambiance and food.  It was very good the first second and third time I ate there. Then last spring I went with my daughter. They had done remodeling and removed this cool palapa bar that used to be inside. This time the food was bad. My daughter didn't like her food, I didn't like my enchiladas which I had liked on previous occasions. Today I went in and ordered the special...flautas. He asked me chicken or beef. I asked to have one of each, he seemed confused. Then he asked me flour or corn tortillas. I said I thought Flautas were flour tortillas. He said OK flour. At that moment I knew he only knew enough English to get by. I thought taquitos were corn and flautas were flour? I get the plate of food. The rice andbeans were actually good this time. The flautas were very small. Every other restaurant I have ordered Flautas, they come with sour cream and guacamole. Not these. As plain as could be. I like salsas but theirs was bland and watery. My boyfriend ordered chicken fingers...I know...he wasn't very hungry. They guy tried to tell him that was the children's menu. My boyfriend pointed it out on the menu to the waiter, that it was not on the children's menu. He walked away and came back saying it was OK, he could have the chicken fingers. They were just like a cheap box brand of frozen chicken nuggets. He said they were horrible and refused to eat them. They did take the 8.99 off the bill. Another thing that has changed is the entire menu and the prices for lunch and dinner are the same. They used to have mon-fri lunch menu. Not anymore. The prices are ridiculous. $13-$26 with the average price around $20. Used to be able to get a nice combination lunch for $8.99 to $9.99 average. I want to know if they did indeed change ownership. What I do know is I will never go back to eat there.",

(Chapala's has better ones, IMO.) Good green chili chicken tamale, but not enough of the sauce. Overall, nothing special, and EXPENSIVE for the experience, especially for a lunch.

    "text": "If you're looking for an hole-in-the-wall LA style Mexican restaurant, look no further! In my opinion, delicious Mexican restaurants in Vegas are few and far between. I've been here a few times, just with my husband and with large groups of friends, and have not been let down.   The food is yummy and the margaritas are yummier! I like that the guacamole is served in a mini tortilla shell, that way you can enjoy every last bit of it. Service is quick and the atmosphere is festive. It's actually borderline \"disney-fied.\" It's almost over the top but not quite. If you enjoy first Friday but would like to sit and eat before walking around, this is the perfect spot to do that, located right on Main Street. There is metered parking out front, but it also has a private lot.   On my most recent visit, I enjoyed the beef enchilada with a chicken taco and my husband enjoyed the nachos. We both partook in jumbo margaritas. Good stuff!",

I like the red half the best and the meat was delicious! I also loved the salsa, which is usually gives me a clue about wether or not I'm going to like the food. Also if you're a souvenir junky like me, they will sell you a picture of your group in a cute Vegas frame. If you don't want to purchase it, you still get a cute free version.",

    "text": "I usually come here with a group of people and the service tends to be good.  I was in the area and decided to stop by with my wife and get a shrimp cocktail. As soon as we parked and where headed inside we noticed 3 separate bums one laid out in the parking lot one at the corner stop sign and one walking inside the establishment. I don't have anything against homeless people but these people are beyond homeless you can tell the druggies and simply strung out and  just loitering around the business. Not really a good feeling when leaving and parking your car in the \"additional parking\" which is located in the back of the restaurant.  As soon as we walked in we where greeted by a very Hispanic women wearing a.. what a call MARIA DRESS!!! The restaurant itself screams MEXICAN and so does the exceptional food they put out as we walked in to the right we noticed a lovely older lady which could have been one of my grandmothers making fresh tortillas and fresh tortilla chips the smell was awesome. The only down fall is that I noticed that the staff seemed more preoccupied talking amongst themselves then taking care of customers it felt as if we had to let them finish talking to each other before they would notice or talk to us.   I knew what I wanted to I tried to quickly place my order but was told that I needed to wait for the waiter. The waiter arrived to take the order and my wife had a regular water I ordered a fresh mango water and the shrimp cocktail. The order was made very fast id say it took about a whole 3-4 minutes for the shrimp cocktail to come out as a matter a fact the shrimp cocktail came out before the water which baffled me. I even told the waiter the cocktail came out before the drink?? he quickly replied and said why yes because the mango water has to be freshly made.....so the shrimp cocktail I guess was waiting for me..... The waiter then left and proceeded to a different table. This made me a little upset so I waived him down and asked him kindly to please bring the regular water that is not taken out of the well so that we may have something to at least drink on. The waiter then came back with both the waters.  The shrimp cocktail here is amazing the shrimp are a medium sized shrimp and there are plenty of them WELL THERE BETTER BE AT 15.99 a cocktail. I think that the price is a little high but it is worth it. I have not found another shrimp cocktail to be this tasteful and this rich in flavor and this is the only reason I come here.   The service was so subpar I refused to leave a tip. When I was paying it seemed like I was bothering the cashier to come check me out after I had already been waiting for 10 minutes at the table for them to come back with my credit card and check. The customer service here is not so great but the food well at least the shrimp cocktail is AWESOME!!!",

    "text": "This place is awesome! I walked in here for \"Taco Tuesday\", sadly.. no actual Taco Tuesday specials but thats ok because the Tacos are already cheap! I came for lunch and they have a happy hour on drinks so I managed to get myself a good Taco, Beer, and free chips and salsa at the bar for under $8!  Casa Don Juan is located in Downtown Las Vegas within the \"Arts District\" so you will find cool hipster coffee places, vintage clothing stores, and the antique mall right across from this place. This area is really booming since the streets and buildings are getting a facelift the past year. The restaurant is really Mexican as far as decor goes which I love since I am eating at a Mexican restaurant not chipotle. The staff is awesome and the vibe is chill. Great place for a meeting, drinks with friends, or just a spot to have lunch or dinner! Enjoy!",

    "text": "The original of what is now 3 locations Casa Don Juan is a staple of traditional Mexican food and one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. I think there are other really good Mexican places in town, but they can be inconsistent. I've always had quality experiences here and have yet to try something I don't like.  I really enjoy the Puerco En Chili Verde, the Super Burrito, Chicken Enchiladas, and Bistec Ranchero.  But have tried most of the menu and everything has been great.   The price point is great too. For the amount of food it's hard to beat. The Puerco en Chili Verde is $12.99 and comes with a solid portion of pork onions and tomatoes in a spicy chili verde sauce, tortillas, a heaping side of rice and beans.   They often have a Groupon for two entrees and two margaritas which is clutch, because you definitely want a margarita. They are massive and delicious.",

I ordered a shrimp tostada, which had no flavor(how could you seriously go wrong on a shrimp tostada)? The tostada was soggy, so I had to eat it with chips. My husband ordered the carne asada sopes, which the meat had no flavor either, the beans tasted like canned beans. My daughter had the carne asada quesadilla, which again meat was bland, no flavor. My son had the enchilada plates, which I did not try, but he is a big 17 year old kid with a big appetite & he didn't even finish his plate because he did not like it. My other daughter had the chilaquille plate, and said it was just ok. This was a very expensive dinner for tasteless food! Will never come back again sorry.",

    "text": "I grew up on beans and cheese. I would be happy the rest of my life if all I ate could be bean and cheese burritos. I'm a simple gal. However, even simple gals know when they are dining at a great Mexican joint.  I've been to Casa Don Juan a few times. Inviting  staff are always present to great me, and the severs are always attentive and kind as well.  Some of my favorites have been the Cheese Tamales and the Chicken Tacos. This time around I had the Caesar Salad with grilled chicken, because, let's face it, I can't eat bean and cheese burritos everyday.   The tamales are filling, sometimes a little bit dry but still great. The tacos are great as well, not too heavy and very tasty. And my salad, well it's salad, but it's good! The grilled chicken is savory. I also love that they serve refried beans with their chips, because it's one way that I can get my bean craving fulfilled.  I have always ordered a Strawberry Margarita on the rocks with my meal here. I don't know why, it's just some weird craving. This frosty treat is a little dessert in a way. This time around, the margaritas weren't all that frosty (even a tad bit room temperature). It was a bummer, but since I've been here a few times, I know that's not the standard.  I will be back, of course.",

    "text": "I wish Yelp would strike the \"A\" from \"A-OK.\"  Casa Don Juan is fair, but doesn't rate an A in my book. That Scarlet letter is making me give this two stars.  I've been to the one on Buffalo and really liked the atmosphere, food, and service.  Here, not so much.  But we were downtown, which doesn't happen often, with a Groupon that had expired, but still worth something, so we went.  And even though it was a Saturday night, the place was nearly empty, so there was plenty of space in the parking lot.  The restaurant was freezing, so much so that my husband was visibly shaking from the cold.  No matter which table we tried, it was the same.  And active ceiling fans only made it worse.  Luckily, I had a sweatshirt in the car, but he was SOL. Even though the manager grudgingly turned down the thermostat, it didn't help much.  It's hard to enjoy the best meal when you're colder than a cadaver with rigor mortis.  But this wasn't the best meal.  Herb had Chicken in Mole, which was a pretty small portion, and I ordered Chilaquiles.  I don't think any two restaurants, or even two Mexican madres, make it the same way, but this was simply ordinary.  I ordered the green sauce, because the waiter said it was spicier than the red, but it turned out to be 2 or 3 out of 10, and I don't like overly spicy food.  Also, it was just about the most expensive item on the menu, and I can't figure out why.  A little chicken, a lot of fried tortilla chips, some sauce, no leftovers.  And I'm not a big eater.  There was nothing welcoming about the service, either from the front or from our waiter, who wasn't terribly friendly and seemed to be perpetually annoyed, even though we demanded nothing.    I read that they're going to be doubling the size.  I wish them well.  They won't be doing it for us. There are too many other Mexican joints in town that are much, much better.",

    "text": "So on my very first night in Vegas, when I'm there for the very first time, I'm at the hotel bar with a co-worker (we were there for a conference) and we're starving...and we ask the bartender for a recommendation.  Something local, affordable, fairly close.  He shoots off a couple of recommendations that all seem a little higher end (we were in shorts and jeans and didn't want to change).  He then thinks for a second and says...\"I know this local Mexican place you might like...\" and that's how we found Casa Don Juan.  When I need a good place to eat...I always ask a bartender - never had a bad meal on a bartender recommendation.  As we left the comfy confines of the casino areas and found our way into a different part of the city I had a feeling I was going to be really happy with this meal (big fan of off the beaten track restaurants).  We got to the place and parked (not a ton of parking, but we were fine) and we were happily greeted by the hostess who seated us immediately and gave us menus.  We also ordered a couple of Tecates and some fresh guacamole which came out a few minutes later with chips, salsa and frijoles.  Usually not a Guac fan, but this was pretty good...we hammered it.    I ordered the Super Burrito Asada with Chicken and red sauce with rice and beans and my co- worker ordered the Chimichanga with shredded beef and also with a side of beans and rice.  I don't know about you, but when my meal comes out and I know just by looking at it that I'm gonna have a tough time finishing it...I know I'm getting my money's worth.  This burrito was fabulous and was bursting with flavor...and when I walked out of the place I was stuffed...and I was still full in the morning - I skipped breakfast!  My co-worker also loved the chimichanga and said the shredded beef was perfect.  Everything about this place screamed to me that it deserved a second meal...unfortunately, I have NO idea when I will be back in Vegas.  Great service, great food, ice cold beer, and a really great eclectic Mexican decor.  Yeah, I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves Mexican food!",

I've been eating at Casa Don Juan for years and the food has never changed and is always top notch!  We were promptly seated and asked if we want cheese dip of guac.  Of course we said yes to the guac!  Your crazy if you don't say yes!!  I love that the cost is \"market price\" like we are ordering a lobster or something.  It's not crazy expensive and so worth the $5.95 we paid.  The chips and salsa were brought out quickly along with our drink order.  My mom enjoyed her meal as did I.  I ordered the \"super burrito\" with chili verde.  It was the perfect amount of spicy.  It was gigantic and I was only able to eat less than half for I was full from the bomb chips and dips!  We had margaritas to add to the great meal!    The service is always great!  They are friendly and give you the feeling that they are pleased you are there dining with them.  Even the guys who fill your water and refill your chips are friendly and efficient!  They have a small outdoor dining area which would be ideal on a First Friday!  Parking is ample both in front and out back.    Don't listen to the negative ninnies on this place!  They don't know good Mexican food!

This time I had the chicken mole platter with no beans ($13.99.)  I took one bite and could tell that this was prepackaged sauce poured on top of frozen, precut strips of chicken rib meat.   I asked for more salsa and the waiter said \"okay\" but never brought any more out.   I noticed the women at the next table were commenting on how the cheese was congealed on their food. I bet the food goes into a salamander partially frozen for that to happen.  This place needs to pare down their menu and prices and focus on preparing a smaller number of menu items exceptionally well. If they started preparing quality food, they wouldn't need a Groupon when they're already an established restaurant.",

    "text": "This place is muy bueno!  So me and the hubby were headed to a different (read: much further away) Yelp-recommended Mexican joint for some authentic south-of-the-border grub while we were in Vegas for the weekend. Then our casino taxi stand man recommended instead to head to Casa Don Juan and that he's sent many people through the years and they were never disappointed.  To continue with my rule of always trust the locals for great food, off we went!  The decor in this place is awesome - I don't know much about Don Juan, but clearly he was in love with Frida, cuz the walls are basically a tribute to her from an obsessed fan.  Super cool, authentic Mexican decor.  Every time we're in the states we try to get some great Mexican food because (Sorry Canada!) at home it's pretty terrible stuff.This place has an extensive menu, tons of variety, and all reasonably priced.  They have tons of combos to choose from, but they are also flexible if you want something different. But first, one of the best features is the wicked salsa you get with the free chips.  It was so flavorful I couldn't stop eating! It wasn't spicy at all, but to some people that's preferred, and it's super easy to eat.  They also served a side of refried beans for dipping too, which was unique. I ordered a chile relleno and chicken enchilada combo and it was fab. A bit too much cheese inside the relleno (I know - too much cheese? as if there's such a thing! But there was seriously ALOT), but overall a very enjoyable meal.  My husband had a taco, relleno and tamale combo, and as far as I could tell, the tamale was the star.  The huge chunks of flavorful, tender pork were impressive!  Another star here was my mango daiquiri (I'm too much of wimp for tequila).  I think I can safely say that it's the best one I've ever had.  So fruity, smooth, and didn't tasty boozy (but you knew there was a healthy serving of rum in there!).  The service was also impeccable.  Attentive, polite, accommodating, friendly, and really made you feel taken care of.    So, overall - fantastic!  If you're staying near Freemont and want Mexican, check it out!",

Their margaritas are great, though, and are hella strong!  Decor is colorful and bold, but the layout is terrible and doesnt cancel out noise.

My last trip up I took my wife and daughter.  It is never easy to get them to agree on a place, but we barely had conversation during our meal.  We were all just eating a perfect meal. Fajitas are great and the topper.....Home made tortillas. These tortillas are so good, fresh, warm, delicious.  It really makes the difference. Good Job Casa Don Juan!",

Being a Mexican food connoisseur I'd stay they are above average but not the best in Las Vegas. Some places I see could use room for improvement are their salsa and been dip. The salsa wasn't bad however it was a bit watery and the bean dip wasn't as thick as I'd like it to be. I ordered a cheese enchilada & a chili relleno. The cheese enchilada was good. I order one every where I go. The sauce could have a little more spice to it as they were slightly on the tomato-y side but they were very very good. The chili relleno was the first time I had ever had one and it was delicious. We ordered the green chili verde and the pork was tender . Rice & Beans were good. All in all good spot to go eat Mexican downtown. They have a full bar and gaming FYI",

The theme is your (hate to say it) typical Mexican cheese factor with the bright colors, tacky uniforms, and singing guitar guy but once you plop down in a booth and get snacking on their chips, salsa and guacamole, you'll forgive the rest.   Are the chips made fresh? Nah, is the guacamole and salsa? Who knows. What I CAN tell you is that it's good! I dined on the chicken tacos after 2 baskets of chips and salsa and I found the rice, beans, and entree itself to be mighty tasty.   Is it a show stopping place for Mexican food? Not really but if you want that authentic, non-chain feel that few and far between seem to offer in this town, then check out Casa Don Juan's.   4 margaritas (I had company OK), guacamole, 2 entrees, and feeling happy and full cost us about $40!

The food is ASTOUNDING (I had the cheese tamales and an enchilada, my wife had the chile relleno), the atmosphere has improved (it's definitely more fun, now), and the staff seems happier. In fact, well, just thinking about it makes me want to go back.   SO glad they got it back together. I'll be heading back, soon!",

    "text": "My husband and I went here on a very glowing recommendation from my boss.    First, parking is tough but we did find a spot.  We walked in, it was loud and we were not greeted.  Finally, someone says \"two\" and I nod, not knowing who I am speaking with and she proceeds to come around a corner to seat us.  She put us at the smallest table I have ever seen.  It was so squished between two tables that we were unable to sit down.  The hostess dropped the menus and walked away.  We moved the table, physically so each of us could sit down one at a time.    We sat, we sat some more, and finally a bus boy brought us waters, chips and salsa.    We continued to wait until I had to flag down a waiter.    My boss said he orders a top shelf margarita, pork tamale and beef enchilada, so my husband and I ordered that exact same thing.    The chips were stale tasting the salsa seemed out of a can, the beans were very runny.  After finishing off the basket of chips because we were so starved our food finally arrived, the margarita was warm, the red sauce on the enchilada has no flavor like it came right out of a can.  The tamale didn't have the meat inside the masa, it was set on top.  We ate maybe half and then waited forever to refills on our water and the check.    We have been told by others to give it a second chance but I don't see this happening.",

I had a Pina Colada which was prepared and brought out to me in a pineapple. Talk about yummy! My boyfriend had a Watermelon Margarita that was not only smooth, but refreshing and tasteful. I would definitely recommend it. To eat I had shrimp ceviche tostadas that were huge. I could barely eat one. My boyfriend got a cheese enchilada combo and let's just say his plate was spotless when he was done. We topped off the night with fried ice cream which hit the spot. We would recommend this place to everyone. We will be back!!!",

I ordered something different (cheese enchilada and relleno with a side of rice and beans), and this time, it was by far the worst.  The sauce on the enchilada tasted canned (and not even good canned- I happen to like las palmas enchilada sauce), the beans tasted canned, and the relleno could not easily be identified as a relleno.  It was a pile of mush with tasteless red sauce slathered over it.  I am a local and a Mexican, and I have for years and years tried to like this place to support local business, but the mere thought of being invited to lunch here makes me cringe.  Please get better.  I gave them two stars for ambiance and service.  Food alone would've been a zero. Also, please DO NOT insult Mexican food by calling this authentic.  That it is not.",

The restaurant is quaint and comfortable with a lively Mexican atmosphere. Most of the staff members are very friendly and attentive. They will make excellent menu recommendations.  You have to get the queso dip! And the guacamole! Both really are amazing and make perfect starters. I've tried a lot on the menu and you honestly can't go wrong with whatever you choose. The food has a ton of flavor and is always prepared perfectly!  This is the kind of place you can go for dinner and drinks with a few friends and have a good time! You will have a delicious meal and leave satisfied.",

We ordered the pork chile verde--bland, beef in red sauce--also bland, the shrimp tacos--dry and bland, and a carnitas chimichanga which was incredibly salty and oily. Yuck.  Yelp reviewers have let me down on this one.  Plus the food is WAY over-priced. These 4 dishes cost $63!?!  They either over charged us or their prices are ridiculous for the lousy food they serve.",

I had mine frozen (like my heart). Sarie had hers on the rocks (like our marriage). All good. This place gets crankin around 8 pm. So plan on a busy, eventful, loud experience. Which is exactly what we wanted. There was a birthday girl at the booth next to us. She was very pretty.They did the song and dance for her.  Also, the little mariachi man with the guitar can break down one hell of a 'De Colores' if you're interested in that stuff. I am of course. Skipped out on desserts. who can eat a flan after all that booze and chips and rice and beans?  The BEAR can, that's who!

In the past, I have enjoyed the margaritas but not really cared much for the food.  This last time, even the rocks margarita came out lukewarm and was unsatisfying.  The appetizer salsa isn't spicy, the appetizer beans are flavorless and the guacamole was really only tasty because of the onion in it.  My entree was passable, as was my date's.  One positive aside form the friendly server is how fast the entrees arrived - FAST!  Overall, the portions are great too, but the food quality is on par with Macayo's - lots of cheese, but not much flavor.  If you like the food from that other restaurant (and many do) then you'll probably like the food here, but nothing about it seems particularly authentic or even vaguely interesting.

    "text": "I used to come here all the time. About 2 years ago some change happened with the cooks or food they order, I don't know but it clearly was NOT as good as it was befor. Well one day I walk in there with my wife for a quick lunch on a Sunday and ordered a large  Menudo and i orderd enchiladas for my wife. We didn't finish all of the food because it wasn't that good. ( it just tastes like stereotypical fast Mexican food now)  When the waiter came and picked up the plates we did not complain but he asked us whether we liked the food or not because most of it was still on the plate. I told him I didn't like it and I have been eating there for years and to me it just wasn't as good as it used to be. I guess he goes and tells the owner's daughter who was the supervisor for the shift at that moment,  but she comes over tells us she is the owners daughter ..... she is the rudest person I have ever encountered. She told me I was wrong because EVERYBODY else was eating their food and nobody was complaining. I told her I wasn't trying to complain,  the waiter asked me why I didn't finish the food and I was honest I had been going there for four or five years at that point and do not plan on returning. The owners daughter is ghetto and come off as a spoiled brat. I did not need to know your DADDY owns the restaurant. But very well, I will never spend another dollar in that restaurant and will tell everyone I know not to eat the. That girl was so unbelievably rude. When I go and eat out at a restaurant if I don't like something I never complain. But this experience required a pretty long complaint on Yelp seeing how I felt as if she will scolding me and my wife in front of the rest of the customers and I was very embarrassed. It was just crazy, I didn't ask her for a replacement meal, I didn't ask for her to take it off the bill, I didn't ask for a refund but just because I didn't finish my food she felt the need to come over and tell me I was wrong for not liking the food. What is that? Save your money and go eat somewhere else where they know how to treat customers right. There are plenty of better Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas.",

Was in Vegas and found good reviews so my friend and I thought this would be a gr8 way to end our trip b4 we left...WRONG BECAUSE The manager is the rudest person I have ever encountered... in my life.  He was all smiles when we first arrived, he seated us at our table. Then the waiter brought chips, salsa, and guacamole dip to our table and left. Complimentary RIGHT? All Mexican restaurants do this. We ordered our food, was alright. Got the bill and there was a $5 extra charge for guacamole dip WE NEVER ORDERED. Of course I thought this was an honest mistake, I told the waiter who then said sometimes the manager forgets to ask the costumers if they want it. Let me get him.  What??/ we were never \"asked.\" We call the manager who saw people around us were getting curious so he intentionally raised his voice and said \"I know I asked you\" He never did AT ALL \"it's going to be $5\" and he was being adamant. He added insult to injury by remarking well next time now u know in a snark tone. This guy is a major JERK and a LIAR. It's not the $5 but it's the principle of the matter, the fact he straight out lied and then raised his tone when others were listening to make it seem like he was right. The ironic part of all is that we witnessed the same scenario happen a few tables from us. The party called the owner but this time he quietly disputed with them because there seemed to be a very angry man he was dealing with as they were about to leave. I'm connecting the dots, they probably also had an issue with the MANAGER adding something onto their TAB that they never ASKED for. I thought I would end my Vegas trip with a bang by eating here but this guys nasty attitude caused us to leave our food. I couldn't stomach eating left overs from such a shady place. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED",

They were not taking reservations but we were told to call ahead when we were about 10 to 15 minutes away and they would put our names on the list.  We did so and we were seated immediately.  When we walked in the wait staff greeted my mother and me with an enthusiastic \"Happy Mothers' Day\"as we walked to our table. The atmosphere is charming, very old Mexico in decor. The wait staff was dressed in beautiful and colorful peasant dress. The food was outstanding. There was complementary chips, salsa and refried beans as an appetizer. We all asked for water, which came quickly.  We also ordered Sangria, which was delicious with plenty of apples and other fruits. We ordered the Fajitas, with different meats with grilled vegetables (green peppers, sweet onions and tomatoes). They were delicious and more than we could possible eat. It was served with warm flour tortias, rice, lettuce, refried beans and guacamole. We topped it off with honey on sopaipillas. The waiter and staff were very accommodating to our requests and very kind to the children.",

The service was fast and friendly, in fact, our beers and food came out so quickly I was a little shocked. My friend informed me that the food is alway fast. But I know why: the same rice and beans adorn every plate. In fact, the only difference from our two plates was my eggs were probably fried in a pan and his chimichanga was probably fried in a deep fryer.  I thought our service was great from the time we walked in to the time we left. Everyone was happy, friendly, and helpful. This goes a long way for me even if the food isn't that great. I would even go as far to say that the service is what kept this place from getting a two-star rating from me.   Unfortunately, the food wasn't good enough in my book to make a return visit. The food was generally underseasoned and un-inspiring. This is very standard Mexican fare and nothing outside the box. Maybe it is what it is, but this place is a cliche of a place with excellent service..",

We arrived pretty late (30 minutes before closing time). Luckily the waiter warmly greeted us, and did not make us feel as if we had to leave for arriving so late.  The chips and salsa are very good and fresh. They also provide you with a side of beans to enjoy with the aforementioned chips and salsa. I ordered a wet burrito and it was huge! Did not dissapoint. Extremely good!! Plus the waiter was always attentive and provided great service , despite it being past closing time.

    "text": "I've been to a ton of Mexican joints around town. Many times, I've discovered that it's hard to escape the generic expected tastes that they tend to offer. Casa Don Juan seems to escape that trend by incorporating fresh, homemade flavors that I was able to see and taste.   Almost immediately after sitting, we were greeted with chips and salsa. Salsa was great, same with the bean dip. I ended up ordering a side of guacamole with the chips, because of the rave Yelps about it. And yes, I'll have to stand by those reviews, because I absolutely loved the guac.  Entrees did not absolutely blow my mind, but they were still very good. The chicken entrees seem to be a bit lackluster, but the beef dishes seem to be more memorable:  -Bistec de pollo: a very basic grilled chicken breast dish. I would avoid. Almost seems like something I could make at home -Carne Asada taco: delicious, juicy and flavorful pieces of meat. The homemade tortilla goes with this very well. I was a little surprised that nothing else came with the taco. It was just a tortilla filled with meat, with a side of lemon. The carne asada didn't joke around. One bite was both juicy and flavorful. My next visit is going to have to focus on this. -Chicken mole: much better tasting chicken than the bistec de pollo. I'm thinking it's the sauce that saved it.  To end it all, we finished it off with fried ice cream (see picture). Here it's served a little different than I'm used to. Instead of a simple corn flake coating, they add Fruity Pebbles as well. If you're not a fan of the Fruity Pebble taste, maybe you should avoid this. I personally loved it. ---- All in all, the tortillas and guacamole were some of the best that I've had in Vegas. Friendly service and lively atmosphere were also a plus. Chicken entrees come off a little weak, but the carne asada is sure to impress. If you see me back here, my table will be dedicated exclusively to the cow and whatever it has to offer.",

So in addition to paying the bill they charged me they recharged me for the right bill.....It is now almost 25 days later and they charged me the amount they were supposed to charge me 25 days earlier.  There's one thing that you need to look out for with \"quick orders\" and that's making sure everything's cooked...

As we walked back to the restaurant, my sisters car was being towed away. We tried to talk to the man towing it and my sister went in to the restaurant to explain the situation. When she spoke to the manager, the manager was rude. She rolled her eyes and said that it's not her problem. When my mom and sister came we paid the fine and still tried to come in to eat. When we arrived she was talking about the situation in front of me and my family, unaware that we spoke Spanish. Everyone seemed uncomfortable with us, especially when my sister walked in. My sister with the car that was being towed was hesitant to come in, but decide to try to enjoy lunch there despite the rude manger. We had a couple of drinks and chips with dip, but feeling so uncomfortable, we decided to leave. As we walked out my sister asked for the manager's name and she mumbled it and said something under her breath. My sister said, \"I'm sorry, did you say something?\" And the lady said, \"you come in and only have water? Bye! Bye! Bye!\" It was completely professional and rude. We will never return.",

If you travel to Vegas and have a car (wouldn't really recommend a taxi ride, but hey, to each his own), you need to come to Casa Don Juan!  Since there isn't a single place on the strip that offers authentic mexican at a decent price, my family and I always head over here at least once during our Vegas stay. Although slightly overpriced (it IS still Vegas), you can get a very decent sized meal for $15-$20.   I always judge a mexican restaurants' credibility off of ONE FACTOR - their RICE! Most mexican joints have either rice that's too dry/wet or too bland. The rice at Casa Don Juan had that perfect blend of spices and was just the right consistency. I purposefully saved it until the end so that I could end my meal with a bang!  The food itself is pretty good in general. They have all the regulars like combination plates and specialties, but they also have tamales everyday (which is not very common). They're pretty good as well and offer about 5-6 varieties.",

Initially walking in the door the girl at the front wasnt very friendly when we asked about happy hour. She was a lil snippy and no reason to be. Sat down the waiter was very friendly and nice although I dont recall his name. He was very attentive and got our drinks and chips quickly. The menu I felt was way over priced 12.99 for 2 chicken enchiladas with beans& rice. Everything was 12.99 and up.. the food was flavorless except the green sauce. Felt like for the price it should have been alot better. I've been going to Chapala's for years and thought id try this spot but I have to say no comparison at all. I can't say I will go back again here.",

Inside is spacious and the walls are filled with Mexican decor. This last visit the place was packed, so I thought the wait would be long, but we were seated at a half booth half table right away. Our drink orders were soon taken and our server was nice about giving us time to look over the menu.   Chips, Bean Dip and Salsa - All complimentary and tasty. The salsa was fresh however I did favor the bean dip even though I'd have loved some cheese on top. Chips were good.   Cheese Dip with Jalapenos ($6.50) - When the hostess sat us she asked if we wanted some cheese dip and I politely declined. When the person came to take our drink order he too asked if we wanted any cheese dip and I again politely declined. When our server asked if we wanted any cheese dip, I figured it was complimentary since we were asked 3 times if we'd like some. Wrong! Also a waste of money that could have went to a margarita instead. The cheese dip was a very small portion (same size as bean dip and salsa come in) and was not only thin and runny, but it really lacked flavor. I expected to taste some spice since It was supposed to have jalapenos in it.   2 Enchiladas and a Taco Combo #3 ($12.99) - I chose chicken for the taco and even though the chicken tasted great there certainly could have been more of it. I requested that the enchiladas be made with flour tortillas instead of corn and they had no problem making them that way which I appreciated. There was a lot of sauce on my plate and while it did taste great, I would ask for them to go easy on it next time. The enchiladas were perfect and they didn't skimp on the cheese. The beans that accompanied the dish were very good and I liked that there was cheese on them.   I enjoyed a few strawberry margaritas and the price especially for Downtown was on point at $6.50 each and they were not weak. If you don't want to mess with driving Downtown they do have a Summerlin location. It's worth noting that Casa Don Juan has a breakfast menu that's offered from 7 am - 11 am and they also have a kids menu.",

He absolutely did not like it so he complained. Juan came out to apologize, and said he would take it back and attempt to make it the way my boyfriend liked it, spicy and full of flavor. When Juan came out with the new michilada, he did not disappoint. My boyfriend says it's THE BEST michilada he's had in this city. GREAT SERVICE! We will definitely be back for the michiladas & tacos!",

    "text": "We found this restaurant by looking on Groupon for dinner deals in Vegas. The Groupon being offered was for 2 dinner entrees (up to $12.99) and 2 jumbo margaritas for $27 (a $46 value). Ideally, we wouldn't have purchased a Groupon for a place so far from where we were staying on the strip, but it was a pretty good deal and decided to give it a try. As we were driving to this restaurant, our Lyft driver was surprised that we wanted to go to a place so far off the strip but reassured us that it was authentic Mexican food. We had high hopes and expectations for this place.   First negative of this dining experience was the location. Not only was a 15 minute Lyft ride but they were doing construction all around the restaurant, so the drop off/pick up is really inconvenient.   Once we got inside the restaurant, the friendly hostess seated us and offered us guacamole or bean dip to start instead of the complementary salsa, but we decided to go with the salsa. Our short interaction with her was the end of the positive customer service we received during the rest of our time at this restaurant.   Our waiter, whose name I don't recall, came to take our drink order and was friendly to begin with. Once I mentioned that we would be using a Groupon, his whole tone and body language towards us changed immediately. He said, with an attitude, we could only get the house flavor margarita or we had to pay an additional cost for a flavor upgrade. We said that was fine, and we had no problem paying the $1.50 difference for a strawberry instead of lime flavor. He then proceeded to whip open the menus for us and directed us to the two pages of dinner entrees we were allowed to pick from. I was highly disappointed in their lack of vegetarian options, but was not about ask if I could sub veggies instead of the chicken, beef, pork, etc. due to our waiter's poor attitude. I decided on fish tacos and my boyfriend chose one of their burritos.   The restaurant was not too busy when we came in but by the time we placed our order, our waiter had a couple tables in addition to ours. Our food took an average amount of time to be prepared.   After our food was brought out, that was the last time anyone checked on us throughout our meal. The food came out hot, and was very tasty and fresh. By the time our meals came, my boyfriend and I were over half way done with our margaritas and waters, and figured our waiter would be over to offer us another round of drinks. We spent 20 minutes enjoying our meal and in that time frame, our waiter did not once come to check on our drinks, how our food was, etc. After we finished eating, we sat at our table for close to 15 mins waiting for the bill while our waiter completely ignored us. While I realize he had a couple other tables, I've have never had an experience with a waiter/waitress who couldn't juggle 4 tables. There were multiple times he looked over at us and I made eye contact with him to signal that we were ready to cash out, yet he turned his back to us each time. At one point, I was going to ask the hostess to print our bill off so we could get out of there. He must have sensed that we were growing increasingly impatient and finally came to our table and said \"is everything okay?\" in a snippy tone. At this point, we were very disappointed. Our original plan was to order another drink before we left, but based off of how we were treated, we told him to bring the bill.   After our waiter applied the Groupon, all we were left to pay was the taxes and up charge on the margarita flavor, which came out to be around $9. I know that when using Groupons/coupons, the correct thing to do is to tip on the original price, not the discounted price. This experience, however, made me so upset that I was VERY tempted to tip on the $9 that we owed. However, being the decent human beings we are, we tipped him on what the meal should've cost without the Groupon.   Maybe our waiter was having an off day, but I don't believe this was the case. He probably thought we were going to short him out of a decent tip as we were using a Groupon. If he did not want to take care of a table with a Groupon, he should've asked another waiter to take care of us. Instead, we were treated like garbage. We will not be back to this place when we visit vegas again.",

After they already severed me my drink the waiter still came back to ask me if I still wanted water. That lets u know that there customers are always on there minds. I like the uniforms that the establishment wear real culture friendly. Very nice wonderful art all around the restaurant makes u feel a more at piece coming from outta town . And I myself recommend return to Casa Don Juan in the future. Also immaculate air-conditioning. No here was rude all the staff was amazing . I was there and seen another party of at least 12 people and the manager was out helping the waiter severe the family the best way possible. Now that's real team work. I think anyone who comes to Las Vegas sound stop by if you get the taste for Mexican food and music.",

I was highly disappointed to see changes that were not for the better of the restaurant. When we first walked in they seated us promptly even though it was very busy. Our waiter came and took our order and then said chips would be brought to us. The chips look like they came out of a bag and tasted like they came out of a bag and the salsa was very Bland. The beans had good flavor but it was a very small cup of them. I ordered the chili relleno beef enchilada and beef taco with beans and rice and my girlfriend ordered the milanesa meal. The chile relleno was really good I ask for the sauce on the side and the sauce had good flavor. The beef taco was also very tasty but the enchilada was lacking. It was overpowering with meat and very little sauce. My girlfriend's milanesa steak was very Bland and the breading was falling off. we ordered corn tortillas with it that tasted like rubber and we're very lacking in the seasoning Department. This place is overwhelmingly loud and you can't really hear the person across from you but you can hear the people next to you. Our server was terrible we had to wave him down several times for simple things like water refills. We also asked for more beans and he brought us more salsa and when our food came out we asked for sour cream and he never brought it. The service in this place is unbelievably terrible. It's sad to say this place has lost a lot of its finesse. Save your money and yourself and eat somewhere else.",

It was a little heavy on onions but overall the best thing we were served.    Guacamole is sold at market price which is $7.99. A little steep for what is basically one avocado worth of guacamole.   I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas.  Not much seasoning if at all in the fajitas.  I fixed that by adding lime and pouring the salty salsa on top. Lots of onions , bell peppers and onions with a fairly generous portion of meet. Choice of corn or flour tortillas. I got flour and received three warm tortillas.

I will start by saying that I ordered American food ( at a Mexican restautant) so I knew what I was getting myself into, no stars were lost for this. I loved the ambiance and the server was very attentive but the food that we ordered was quite bland and sad. They bring out chips and salsa and BONUS beans!!! The food I had was ham and eggs the eggs were supposed to be well done but they were quite wet and light. The hashbrowns were very oily and crispy and had an almost non-existent potato taste. The server noticed the portion was very small so he made sure to bring extra hashbrowns which was nice. The asada my husband had was a big piece but also bland and his chilaquiles were perfectly sauced with a hint of crunch yum. Where they lost their star was the pricing. Now maybe because they are in a trendy artsy-antique area they have to pay a high price for location but wowy! I don't think the price should've been as high. The second star was lost on the $9 margarita I ordered. It was supposed to be pomegranate but it was lightly flavored and it should've had tequila but that was even lighter, if it was even in there. I'm quite a lightweight these days so I should've definitely tasted the alcohol. My husband had micheladas and he really liked them! We're thinking they might be garnished with a really well marinated shrimp so it added to the drink but be careful of you have an allergy.",

Decor is like being transported to Mexico, warm and comfortable. Service was prompt. Our server Ivan was friendly and helpful. His associates also helped in removing empty dishes.   The kitchen was busy, as there were several large groups, however wait time for drinks and food was minimal. A complementary basket of tortilla chips with 2 dipping sauces, re fried beans and salsa arrived  shortly after being seated. The chips were fresh as we could see them being made across the room. My wife ordered the Vegetarian Burrito. It was a large portion. She would have preferred more beans and less rice. I ordered the combo platter with one Chile Relleno, one Cheese Enchilada, beans and requested the spicy sauce. Great flavor from the sauce and the chile was mild. Overall a very satisfying meal.",

The chips were warm the cheese dip, salsa and guacamole were super good! I had a trash coffee that I brought in with me and they told me no outside drinks so I tossed it and the hostess told me their coffee was super good. Man she was right it was amazing I got 2 cups. I ordered a carne asada plate with flour tortillas there was a lady in the station in front of us making the tortillas fresh. Everything tasted amazing. My boyfriend ordered a tamale and ceviche plate and his was also very good. We are staying in a hotel so we finished everything and were totally stuffed so no dessert for us. The wait staff was very attentive and checked on us, filled our drinks and cleaned up extremely regularly we definitely recommend this place.",

The Mexican food is close to authentic, with rustic elements and more seafood than what you might associate with Mexican fare, though I'm told that is the real deal.  The rice and beans were scrumptious. Only downside might be getting a table during peak times and parking on the street.  Worth it if you are hankering for Mexican fare and are downtown.",

Living in Tucson, AZ for the last 15ish years, I am VERY hard to satisfy when it comes to Mexican food. I love Casa Don Juan. The vibe, food, drinks and staff all make this place worth the trek downtown, for sure.   As this place can be a bit busy, we usually grab a margarita at the bar while we wait for a table. Their margarita are great. They don't over-do it on the sweet. They are limey, strong and delish. I usually order the skinny, just because it is even less sweet than the House or Cadillac Margaritas. They also offer a variety of flavors, if that's your style.  The menu here is CRAZY huge, so I would be surprise if you couldn't find something here you loved. As is standard each type of food is split into sections, which eases the search for what you like.   Everything I have tried here hasn't disappointed. The Chile Relleno, Shrimp tostadas, Veggie Fajitas, all so yummy. And, most importantly, their salsa, guac and beans do not PLAY. So yummy and spicy. If you are looking for Mexican food in Vegas (THAT ISN'T LINDO and is actually good) go here ASAP. You won't be disappointed.",

How hard is it to make a cheese and onion enchilada?  Today it comes not only cold, but without the onions.  The server when I ordered even repeated that they were to have onions in them.  Anyway, server took the plate back and they were redelivered hot, but still without onions.  His answer then was to add raw chopped onions to the left over I took back to the hotel.  $15.00 wasted money!  They should have remade them as ordered instead of just sticking them in the microwave.  They should have done the right thing and either comped or discounted the meal since they are the ones who F#%*ked up the order to begin with!  Sad part is that we have plans on having dinner there in a couple of days with friends and since this was preplanned, I can't change it!  Hopefully it will be better.",

    "text": "Casa don Juan and I have had an up and down relationship in the past. The first time I came here I loved it, second time I was disappointed. It's been about two years (honest to goodness, really TWO YEARS?! time flies.) that I've been back.  After checking out the new bar down the street (which I will review later) my friend and I were having drunk hunger pains. I was in the mood for Mexican and was contemplating El Gordo, but since Casa don Juan was in perfect walking distance we decided to dine-in here once again.  Let's begin with pricing - I think theirs stinks big time. Look, most Mexican places in Vegas are traditionally not hard on your wallet. You can usually get a combo plate in the 10 buck range (including taxes) as long as you aren't ordering carne asada or shrimp. But not at CJ's. Dinner menu boasts prices of $11.99+ and even appetizers prices are flagrantly high, especially considering the location of this place. Look, I'm not a cheapskate, nor do I think businesses should not make money, but the bottom line is I can go to numerous other Mexican restaurants and have just as good food for about 5 dollars less.  Food - Chips were brought out cold. Bean dip was decent and warm. Salsa at least has a spice-kick to it, so it's not totally bland.  Ordered - The \"Casa don Juan\" style wet burrito with chicken. The burrito is a decent size, comes with guac on top and the \"wet\" sauce. As for inside, you get beans, lettuce, meat, pico de gallo, rice, and lettuce. To me, the lettuce was gross, wet and mushy. The beans were eh same goes for the rice. The chicken was not seasoned very well - just plain 'ol shredded chicken. Overall the burrito was filling for my drunk tummy and that's all she wrote.  So. The deal is I would really love to at least LIKE Casa don Juan, but they just ain't cutting it. They need to make the food better and keep the prices, or they need to lower their menu prices and keep the same mediocre food. As with many places downtown I think Casa don Juan is going through growing pains and adapting to the new popularity that a decent downtown experience has to offer. I hope they find a happy medium, and I may try them again in the future. We shall see.",

I ordered the tilapia, whole fish pan fried with garlic and it comes with rice and beans.  My friend ordered the tamales with beef taco plate. My food was pretty good. I just did not like the rice and refried beans. They seem generic to me. When I say that, I mean they taste like out of the can and not fresh. I am really harsh on refried beans because they taste the same everywhere. The tamales were ok.   The problem with Mexican food, in my opinion, is that it's so difficult to determine what is good, bad or mediocre.   The service was very good. Maybe...I 'll give this place another shot in the future.",

The steak was well cooked and flavorful and they give u alot of steak! My tostada was delish!! The chips and salsa come with a bowl of refried beans that are just like my abuelita(grandma) use to make.   Service was on point too! Our waiter Arturo was fast and attentive and super friendly! It's hard to find friendly waiters nowadays! I wish I receives this kind of service at every restaurant I went to:) Now why did I give this place 4 stars and not 5 u ask??? My husbands fajitas only came with two flour tortillas!! Who can eat a large plate of delish steak fajitas with 2 tortillas!?? We asked our server for another tortilla and he politely said he would have to charge us for a order of tortillas! Come on owner of Casa  Don Juan!!! Stop being stingy on the flour tortillas! That being said , I would definitely come back to this place!",

    "text": "Never heard of this place, but a friend loved it and wanted to go there. There were several of us and we were seated quickly for a busy Saturday night. The restaurant is really large and I had a really good margarita. We had chips and salsa and bean dip. The salsa was thin and spicy. The bean dip was ok.  I originally had beef tacos, beans (only refried) and rice.The beans and rice were ok. That's something that is hard to mess up. The beef tacos were made from shredded beef. I don't care for shredded beef tacos, but that wasn't my complaint. The tortillas for the tacos were so greasy that I couldn't eat them. YUCK!  I ordered an enchilada since I couldn't eat the tacos. There was nothing special about the enchilada. It was big. I'll say that.   The service was very good. Servers were friendly and attentive. The restaurant is large and can accommodate groups. The problem that I have with large Mexican restaurants that accommodate groups is that the food is usually lacking in quality. I personally feel that this is the case here. I won't go back.",

    "text": "I am usually a huge fan of Casa Don Juan.  My husband and I go there often for dinner and have always enjoyed it. It is close to my work and co-workers and I go there regularly, but yesterday my experience was disappointing.  I had a Groupon and went there with a couple co-workers. I ordered a Vegetarian Burrito.  I have ordered this burrito many times and have always enjoyed it.  To make it a little more substantial, I asked if I could add chicken to the burrito. The server said that it would be an extra charge, which I completely understood.  The burrito already has rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and pico, so of course charging for chicken is understandable. When we received the bill, they had charged $7.99 for chicken! That is more than the burrito itself (Vegetarian Burrito is $5.99)!  Another co-worker of mine ordered a chicken burrito wet, and it was $7.99.  She wanted sour cream so they charged extra for it.  That is understandable, but charging $5.99 for the vegetarian burrito and then $7.99 for chicken to be added is ridiculous!  I asked the server what the $7.99 was for and she told me it was for the chicken, and \"I told you that would be an extra charge.\"  I told her I understand that, but $7.99 on top of the $5.99 for the burrito was not reasonable. I then asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over and I explained the situation to him.  He responded, \"She told you there would be an extra charge for the chicken.\" I told him I understood that, but $7.99 seems a little unreasonable and if you are going to charge that much you should tell your customers because I am sure no one would pay that.  You could order a whole other burrito for that price! He said that it was rude to tell people the price because it appears that you are implying that they can't afford the $7.99. I told him it was rude and dishonest to NOT tell your customers you were charging them $7.99 for a piece of chicken. He finally stated that he couldn't do anything, that they charged what the owner makes them charge, and \"it is what it is.\"  I was so appalled by their attitudes and lack of customer service. They didn't even try to fix the situation.  Like I said, I do not work far from there, and many of my co-workers go there because we enjoy the food and usually good customer service, but this was unacceptable.  I have told other co-workers and friends about our experience yesterday and they couldn't believe it.  They all thought it was unreasonable and dishonest and were very disappointed. I don't want to say that we will never go back, but it definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back anytime soon.",

In an area of less than sightly individuals and bail bonds offices (which should tell you something) this place is a gem.  I have had numerous items on the menu and I keep coming back to the Carnitas, not only because I am a huge pork fan, but they do it right here.  The pork is always very flavorful and fork tender; it comes served with rice, beans, pico de gallo and guacamole.  The tortillas and guacamole are made in house, as well as the salsa and they are all excellent.  I thoroughly enjoy the food at Casa Don Juan and the only thing I would change is the location.",

When we inquired if they had another salsa that was hot, we were charged $1.50 (don't mind the charge) for Habanero salsa that did not do anything except help us spice the rest of the food. Burrito seemed to have little if any chicken. Chicken fajita and Beef and shrimp fajita had no flavor. Took the left overs home, threw in some more onions, salt and pepper. Used green salsa/sauce from another Mexican restaurant and that made it taste good.  Also the guacamole just had avocado,  rest of the usual ingredients seemed to be missing.

The food here is above average, meaning it's not the best I've had in Las Vegas, but definitely not the worst.  The prices here are on the more expensive side, but it won't completely break the bank.  It can get busy during the lunch hour for all the professionals working downtown.   The service here is excellent and that's really their strength.  They will make your guacamole to order, the chips and salsa are really good.  The tortillas are made at the restaurant.

    "text": "This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town and it doesn't hurt that it's located downtown near where I work. The service here is always wonderful and you are greeted as soon as you enter. And in my experience, unless you come during First Fridays, you are typically seated immediately. Once seated, drink orders are taken pretty quickly and then fresh chips and salsa are brought to your table. Sometimes they automatically bring you guacamole too, which is an extra $5.99 charge, so if you don't want it you may have to tell them upfront.  The food is priced reasonably, although it can be considered expensive for Mexican food, depending on what you order. Regardless, the food comes out quickly and the portions are fairly large. I usually get the same few entrees: huevos rancheros if it's breakfast time, or enchiladas or fajitas if it's lunch/dinner time. The food is delicious, comes out hot, and I haven't had anything I didn't like. I've had margaritas on a few occassions and they are pretty large, whether frozen or on the rocks, although not very strong (surprise, surprise). If you like it strong, you may have to ask them for a few extra shots...  Sometimes when I'm here the owners and managers walk around the restaurant to check on each table, which I find nice. Not many casual restaurants focus on customer service anymore and it's always about speed now. The waitresses here are patient but speedy with drinks/orders at the same time. The only thing negative about this place is that parking can be kind of tough if you come when it's busy. They only have a couple dozen spots in the back, as well as some meter parking out front.  Overall, I enjoy this place whenever I stop by and am always recommending it to friends and family.",

The restaurant had all the looks and feel of a traditional restaurant. The service was great as well, I had to wait because the order got mixed up but that was fine. What wasn't fine was the food. I had a beef and chicken fajita plate. The food was horribly bland, even the bell peppers on the plate didn't have any flavor. Overall I probably won't eat here again but everything else was great but there's no reason for me to eat somewhere that I didn't enjoy the food.",

The outside of the restaurant and the decor on the inside was fabulous. I was so excited. When the food arrived at the table it was horrible! Not worth the price on the menu. We were never offered a refill or even saw our waiter until the check came. My husband had to walk over and grab the pitcher of water. That's the only reason we were helped. The worst part was when the lady came over and literally started cleaning our table off when we were still eating! She grabbed the salsa and my husband had to ask her to please leave it. Then, she reached over and asked my kids to hand her their plates!! I immediately stood up and politely told her we would just leave. Horrible horrible place! Spend your money at Lindo Michoacan",

    "text": "I made reservations to have my Birthday dinner here on Friday June 29, 2018, and invited 15 of my closest friends and family to celebrate with me, so including me that made a party of 16. I am then told any parties over 15 have to put a $100 deposit down, even if I am just 1 person over. I left the deposit and made the reservation.   On the 29th we show up, the wait staff was friendly and I enjoyed my meal, but we had separate checks, and since it was my Birthday my friend paid for my meal! When it came time to ask for my deposit back is when I knew this was gonna be a problem. The reaction of the waiter that I asked for a refund of the deposit was like he had never heard someone ask for a refund. He had no idea how to handle the issue and had to get another waiter, who wanted to apply it to one of the checks! I explained my meal was paid for and I was not going to apply my deposit to someone else's check. He asked how I wanted it I said cash would be cool, but if not just refund my card, gave him my card and he left. About 15 minutes later he returned my card and made me sign a refund receipt. We left to continue our night. Monday comes and I check my account and see that I have not received my refund. I call and they explain it would be there Tuesday since it was done on a Friday night. No refund on Tuesday so I call again and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about and said they \"couldn't find the paper\" so I had to text a picture of my receipt to the daytime manager Lupita who then texted me back that my refund will be there to check and if not wait 24 hrs. as of today no refund. I text her to inform her and her response is to wait 2 more days. How can they instantly charge the deposit to my account but it somehow takes a week to put it back!!? Again the wait staff was friendly and we enjoyed our meals and I wish this review could have been more about the food instead of the poor management.    I am just very disappointed in how this issue is being handled which is why I am giving a 1 Star review. So I will not recommend having a large party come to this place to anyone let alone my friends or family! Maybe a date that likes Mexican food, not not a large party, and whatever you do...  !!DO NOT LEAVE A DEPOSIT WITH THIS PLACE!!THEY WILL GIVE YOU THE RUN AROUND WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUING A REFUND!!",

Maybe a slight step up in food then Roberto's who now has sacrificed flavor for big chain. I would recommend this place to get a feel for yourself and look forward to your review.

We ended up here on the suggestion of our Lyft driver ( I'm glad he stepped in because we were getting ready to really miss out).  First off, this placed was packed which is a great sign that the food is delish. Second off, they give you free bean dip and salsa and I must say that it was Elite when you combined the two together.   Need let's get to the food. The Menu is loaded with several different combos to fit what you are looking for. I went with the two enchiladas plate that came with rice and beans. The enchiladas  one beef and One chicken were covered in a verde sauce that had the perfect spice. The food was perfect. When I hit Vegas again and want some Mexican this is the only spot for me.",

    "text": "Wow!!! what an experience. Aside from their AC not working at 117 degrees outdoors,asking to be placed at a different table because the heat was unbearable, our server Jesus B.  was trying to pocket $100 our friend payed without letting us know. Our friend was the first to leave so we watched him as he payed his food on his way out. Little did we know he was being generous and payed more than what he consumed. Once the bill arrived I reviewed it but his food was still being charged on it. We waited for Jesus to come back around to our table and when he finally did I questioned him about the money that was given him to cover part of the bill. He would have never told us money was payed to him at this point if we hadn't seen it all. he proceeded to tell us he only payed $80 and to go ahead and just pay what was left on a bill of $186. So, to leave $100 dollars. REALLY !!! I call my friend to confirm the amount that was payed and he said $100. At this point he turned a million colors not expecting us to call and confirm. We then were pretty fed up and offended at his shady service so we left $80 on the table and we explained why, his only response was \"oh Ok, thats fine, and we all walked out. He never came out trying to collect the $6 we were short on. He must have did something wrong.",

The server brought guacamole, salsa, and bean dip to the table with fresh chips. things were looking good!  Guac was very tasty, bean dip very tasty, but the salsa was sort of thin and bland, and seemed like it had some sort of thickening agent in it. When the entrees arrived, they were underwhelming. I had a beef enchilada, beef taco and a chile relleno. I didn't care for the sauce at all. The taco was ok. the chile relleno had too much cheese, and I didn't care for the cheese they stuffed it with. I took about three bites, and that was it.  Service was outstanding throughout. Although the service and decor were outstanding, I didn't care for the food at all, and will probably not be back.",

The waiter wasn't great and seemed to disappear when we needed napkins and forks.  Something is different :( probably won't be coming back for awhile!

The food was prepared and served as if you were at your grandmother's house! The portions were large, the ingredients tasted fresh, and the plates were served hot. Everything tasted home made and full of flavor! Our servers were very pleasant and the restaurant was clean. No complaints here!",

They either really don't update their own website, or have ridiculously inflated their prices while this groupon is on - i'm not sure which.   It was a great deal $10 lunch for 2 and of course there was a $ restriction on the food ($10-11/person), and you pay whatever is over, which is fine. Except that it doesn't mention you can't just order an $8 burrito, you can only order from their comidas y cenas pages (plates w/ beans and rice). Website says $13 for a chimichanga/current menu is $16, website says $10 for chilaquiles/current menu is $20. This isn't effen Border Grill wtf!   I liked the atmosphere, the food was ok, not much better than Roberto's though. Fast friendly service, but i don't appreciate this bait and switch sh*t.

Don Juan was always very welcoming it just felt like I was always with family whenever I'd dine here! ****TODAY**** I Brought a friend here for lunch to celebrate her birthday it was her first time at Casa Don Juan. She liked the decore and atmosphere.  I was a bit disappointed for the first time ever. It felt like we were rushed, my friend ordered a tostada de ceviche but didn't have a chance to tell our waiter ( Alfredo)  what kind she wanted, he brought her fish. She wanted shrimp she didn't want to complain. I asked for A Vuelve a la Vida which is a very expensive and got mostly juice not much shrimp or octopus in it and it was salty. I didn't want to send it back never had to do it before. I didn't recognize any of the workers seems like everyone is new?!?! I was a little disappointed with the food but the staff was nice and friendly just need to make sure of what the customer wants. I will be visiting the new location in the near future and won't let this bad experience ruin my opinion of the restaurant, still love this place and will forever be a loyal customer.",

We came during lunch hour and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  - Groupon lunch special was only valid for lunch entrees. Cheapest Lunch entree was 11, so the value of actual $20 is diminished.  - Love the Chips and Dip! Dip comes with both salsa and beans! This is the first Mexican restaurant where they gave beans for free!  - Large portions.  - Fast and friendly service. Everything went smoothly.  - Super burrito and Enchillada were satisfying. Lots of beef.  - Comparable to Legit SoCal Mexican fast-food (Pepe, Molca salsa, etc...) but you get the whole dining in experience.",

But in the case of Casa Don Juan the 3 1/2 stars they have at the time this review is being written is 2 1/2 stars too much.   I ended up giving Casa Don Juan a try for lunch. And to be honest while it's been less than 2 weeks since I was there I remember these things..which are not good.   Flat iced tea. Very slow service. A very long wait for my check and my debit card to be returned. I do remember trying to enjoy a beef taco but it was too greasy to finish. I remember flavorless chips and...well they call it salsa but I thought perhaps someone confused the salsa bucket in the back with a water jug and they decided to fill it with tap water before realizing their mistake. It was red...it had cilantro and other stuff in it, but it was not anything I'd want to eat again.   I'm really struggling to find something positive to say about this place...and I just can't. I wave my white flag of surrender...I ended up not eating the cheese enchilada! I've never left a cheese enchilada on my plate before. How in the heck can someone mess up a cheese enchilada and leave it flavorless is beyond me but they found a way to do it. To call this stuff authentic...please, stop drinking the tequila because it's not all that.   1 Star - And that's only because I'm forced to give at least one to post.",

However, lately the food has been gross and \"un-authentic\". As we sat, the chips were cold and stale, the salsa and refried beans also cold, lumpy and watery. Strike one. Next came out entrees. Within 10 minutes after place our order (literally 10 minutes), our food came. Here comes strike two: tacos looked as if some through a bunch of ingredients together in a tortilla, fried it with enough grease to take a shower with but yet also cold. Beans were flat and mushy, rice cold and stuck together. I mean, seriously? Complete half-ass food. How do you mess something like this up?  Clearly, just because you have traditional Mexican decor, have traditional Mexican music and your menu in Spanish, does not make you an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant.  In the end, I will not be coming back here. I'd rather drive the extra mile or so to El Dorado Cantina.",

I like the live music they have wandering around sometimes.    In the past though, I've had their nacho appetizer and a breaded filet fish dish.  They were alright, some times on the menu were costly but at the same time I'd pay 14 buckaroo's for this seven seas soup.  Ahh, love the soup more than anything!",

My wife and I ate here tonight, and the only regret I have is that we didn't find it sooner. For less than $40 we both had a couple of Modelo beers on tap, she had two tacos Al Pastor and a slice of chocolate cake to go; I had 2 carnitas tacos and 1 chicken taco, plus all the chips, queso, and salsa we could shove down our throats. Service was fan-fuckin-tastic, and every bite was amazing. I honestly don't know why this place isn't rated 5 stars. Top quality ingredients made fresh, and tasty.  Try getting anything close to that anywhere on the strip anymore. Good luck!",

I had the huevos rancheros but didn't really like the enchilada sauce they use on them so it's not authentic ranchero sauce so I just ate the eggs which were perfectly cooked. My wife had the pork in green Chile and I ended up eating more of that. The coffee was really good even though they don't have flavor cream. One thing we both loved was their homemade flour and corn tortillas. The staff was SUPER FRIENDLY AND ATTENTATIVE. We will stop by for sure next time we're in town.",

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant but the decor is traditional and absolutely beautiful. I still gave out five stars because some of us have bad days.

    "text": "In a nutshell: Consistently good Mexican food.  Today was my second visit. The atmosphere is lively, the service is very good, and there is lots to choose from on the menu. Chips and salsa and bean dip are brought to the table along with ice water. The time from order to receiving food was about normal, not long at all. I got the chicken taco and beef enchilada with beans and rice. The rice was super good. The taco and enchilada were good, too. I also ordered an iced tea & lemonade, which was pretty awful, and I decided it was not lemonade but most likely just a bunch of lemon juice, which is really not great. So that was a miss. Other items ordered were a vege burrito which was quite substantial, and could easily be shared amongst two people, and chicken flautas. For dessert, we ordered sopapillas, which came in three nice sized pillows of yum. They were a tad over cooked, and the honey was just packets of honey, which was for me, kinda not as good as drizzling on your own from a bottle. Overall, the staff is great and always happy, the food is served fast and correct, and the atmosphere comfortable and festive.  Overall, I like eating here and would come back and also recommend.",

A Deposit was required which was no problem for me. The day of there was an all day marathon happening in downtown, CDJ gave me a courtesy call to inform me and to confirm my reservation which I appreciated. Our servers were great they were also able to accommodate 5 extra people that made it out to our dinner at the last minute.   The food was great. My entire family was satistified with the food. Drinks were also very strong and tasty. I had the shrimp quesadilla with a side of rice. My husband had the chile relleno plate and we both had margaritas.   I really appreciated how all the staff got together to sing for us (bride and groom) they also gave us a shot of tequila each hahaha which I thought was pretty cool!!

Also was super impressed with their guacamole. Jesus B. was such an incredible waiter! Bag all our food and salsa for us made it easy to take back to our hotel room. Highly recommend!",

The food is perfection. The service is impeccable. They have the best horchata I have ever had anywhere in my life. They have delicious flavorful red sauce for their enchiladas that has a ton of flavor and isn't too spicy for someone like me who is sensitive to spicy food.  We come here all the time and it is our absolute favorite place to enjoy chips and guacamole and their freshly made bean dip they give you is terrific.",

They should be handcrafting each one instead of using a machine. There is a lot of competition out there and you shouldn't just rely on what you did 5 - 10 years ago and expect the public to pay good money for\"Meh\" food.  I'm rooting for you",

From the time we walk in the door we were spoiled rotten! Great job Javier !! We felt as if we were the only party you had and that definitely wasn't the case.

Greeted by the most beautiful & courtesy hostess certainly sets the tone at this fantastic establishment.  Far from the strip this quaint, hidden jem was worth the drive.  Jose & Jessica lavished us Los Angeles natives with service fit for a couple of hungover queens.  We're all about Food. Service. Friendly bantar. They won our hearts with their wonderful TLC.

After several exchanged messages I told them I would remove the bad review since it used to be one of my favorite places and I'd happily give them another shot. Well that was short lived, AS SOON AS I TOOK DOWN MY BAD REVIEW THEY STOPPED RETURNING MY MESSAGES...so much for the owner making amends. Haven't been back since.   This was one of my favorite spots until recently service has really gone down as well as food quality (my veggies in my fajitas were completely hard like the onion and pepper was sliced and put on after the chicken cooked). To make it worse, I wanted a slice of cake on my way out, god forbid someone ask the young, bothered girl at the front counter. She was so bothered to get a slice of cake for me when I asked she literally responded with \"that lady will get it for you if not I will have to.\" After standing in front of this young girl for five minutes she rolls her eyes and finally goes to the case to get my slice of cake. I was so happy that she picked THE SMALLEST slice of the entire cake (half the size of every single other slice in the case) all because I had to bother her and even ask for a slice to begin with. Such a shame when you ask someone to do such a hard task as grabbing a slice of cake for you, but I guess since I had already paid maybe that's why she didn't care. Made me wait 5 minutes in front of her hoping someone else would come do it so she didn't have to then spun the whole cake around just so she made sure she got me the perfect tiny slice, maybe she thought I didn't need the extra calories",

The Service was top notch with multiple servers checking in on us, even though it was the weekend and a busy Sunday. We were seated immediately (party of 2) and the Manager was making the rounds and stopped by and checked on us, ( she check on every table during our stay). If you're looking for authentic Mexican and a huge drink menu/ full bar and a 5 page menu this is the place. Plenty of shops on all sides to visit before or after your meal. Definitely a Vegas Gem and deserves to be a stop on your stay.",

Margaritas are large and really good.  I ordered the special and had to split it with my husband it was really great food.  We ordered the special with pork and it came with the taco, burrito, beans and rice and the food was awesome.  It was a large plate of food.  We tried to go to dinner on a second trip to Vegas and we couldn't find parking and we circled for at least 10 minutes.  We gave up and I was disappointed.  My husband decided to try again for late lunch the next day and we got it. Yay!!!!  Food was as good as the last trip and service fast and friendly.",

I also asked for a small side of a spicier salsa, they said it would be $3.00! Seriously! Never coming back!",

That took about 5 minutes. When I asked for dressing the waiter looked and acted confused. The choices were ranch, italian or honey mustard. Hummm what would go well with a hawaiian salad that has pineapple and guacamole..... Really none of the mentioned. I ordered ranch.  The waiter brought it to the table with a clunk. You would think with such a beautiful salad there would be a specialized dressing say with pineapple? The ranch did not work. The salsa did not work (no flavor or heat) I am from southern California and have made / eaten lots. Needless to say I will not be going back.",

We started with guac and the complimentary salsa and beans, which I thought were a little bland. We each got a sampler plate and here is where I think they nailed it. I had a steak taco on a homemade corn tortilla and it was downright delicious. The tamale was also homemade and not your store bought style tamale. The corn wrapping was thick and granular (the way I like it) and the filling an awesome shredded spice pork. Definitely going to go again an try some more items. Will keep you posted!",

Streak/shrimp and tamale/taco/enchilada combo pretty good - would give that a 3-4 star rating..",

    "text": "Over the years I have past this place 1000's of times.  I finally had the opportunity to eat there yesterday and it was a big disappointment.  We arrived a little early and decided to have a Beer and much on some Chips & Salsa while waiting for a friend to arrive.  We also ordered a side of Guacamole to go with it.  The Chips & Salsa were ok and the Guacamole was ok.  The Chips didn't taste fresh and there was a bunch of mashed up small pieces at the bottom of the basket, which normally means we got an older batch and had the last basket before they prepared fresh chips.....Strike 1.  When my friend finally arrived, it took forever for the server to come by and take our order.  At first we didn't realize how long it was because we had a couple of Beers to hold us over, but after a while we began to notice that it was taking a long time.  I had to flag her down after waiting for 15 minutes.....Strike 2.  I ordered the Beef Fajitas & 1 of their Jalapeno & Cheese Tamales.  They are known for their Tamales, so I was excited to have an opportunity to try one.  The food came out pretty fast, but they didn't bring my Tamale and they didn't bring a friend's entree.  We waited for the food....they brought out my friend's entree, but forgot my Tamale.  I was too busy eating my Fajitas and didn't notice until I was 1/2 way through my food....I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she'd be right back with it.  Meanwhile, the Beef Fajitas were ok.....the flavor wasn't as robust as I would like them to be.....and the meat wasn't up to par.  It wasn't good quality steak in my opinion.  Everyone finished their food and the conversation was so good that I forgot about my Tamale until my friend brought it to my attention.....damn, by that point I didn't even want it.  So I mentioned it to the waitress.....she apologized, but it didn't seem sincere.  We had a couple more Beers after lunch and when they brought the check, I saw the freakin' Tamale on the bill!  What the hell?!  Strike 3!  At that point, I didn't care anymore and since the Tamale was only $3 I paid the damn bill and we left.  Overall, I was disappointed with the service and the food quality.  Will I return?  Not a chance.",

After we ordered, was told their lunch ended at 3pm so we couldn't use the Groupon. Menu advertised lunch/dinner items with no difference in prices. Meal was fine.  Waiter was somewhat standoffish with non-Hispanic customers.    Didn't want to lose my money for the Groupon so we went back a week later before lunch hour was over.  Showed the Groupon before we ordered so there would be no more errors.  Was told the meal couldn't be over $21.98.  The stipulation on the Groupon didn't say that but whatever.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  The meal was good, however my husband wasn't impressed. Had never know of this place without he Groupon.  Very large and spacious restaurant.  Not very busy on both visits.  One Great thing, the food was delivered to our table in record time.  It was as if the cook heard us when we ordered the food.    The salsa was better than most Mexican eateries.  May come back when on a all ladies outing.",

Located in Downtown Las Vegas - I highly recommend this restaurant! Clean, inexpensive and great quality food! They even had live music//band playing! Margaritas were also to die for! I had the cheese enchiladas and my boyfriend had the chicken tacos! His exact words \"These are the best tacos I have ever had!\"",

We recently took advantage of the Groupon for Casa Don Juan and had dinner and 2 large frozen Margaritas.  The chips come with beans and salsa which are both very good.  I had a combo plate with a Crispy Beef Taco, Chili Relleno and Pork Tamal.  Hubby had the #31 which is the same as what I had but instead of the Tamal, it comes with a beef enchilada.  The beef they use is really tasty and the Relleno's are the best in Vegas.  The food is always very hot, fresh and delicious...our favorite Mexican food option.",

They cost $25 for 2 pictures. They are misleading their customers. Lastly, restrooms are awful. I recommend to go down the street to Tacos Mexico.",

I couldn't be happier that we decided to go to Casa Don Juans anyway. The chips and corn and flour tortillas are all made great fresh, and the salsa, been dip, guacamole, and queso were delicious. The cheese enchilada was one of the best I have had, made with cheddar instead of American cheese with a tangy housemade red sauce.   The carnitas, steak ranchero, and burritos were also all huge hits. And the servers were all helpful, nice, attentive, and generally great. An all around great experience.   One caveat, don't walk there from the strop or downtown. Pretty long walk through a somewhat shady looking neighborhood, take a cab and you're set.",

I feared the food and all good things would vanish when they expanded and opened another restaurant as often happens to small treasured eateries.  My guy and I went for a late dinner 2/16/17.  Chips, salsa and beans arrived.  Ok I know their salsa is not the best, but tonight it was a watery mess.  Then I tried the beans, they looked weird..like thin yogurt.  YUCK. Tasted like they had been diluted with water and lard. I had two chicken tacos crispy with rice and beans and guy had salad with chicken.  We were so hungry (you know this feeling) that my guy and I ate the food as we b*tched about it.  I even asked for different beans..but then said forget it.  The ones with my dinner were the opposite end of wet...dry paste.  Oh, they started dumping trash/food into two large bins by food window..right out in front of us!  GROSS.  Then proceeded to stack chairs onto the tables..guess it as hint to clear out even tho we were still eating...should have taken as a 'sign' and stopped. I came home and had to stop thinking of how bad the food was for fear of up-chuck.  Had to take Mylanta before I could sleep. YUCK-  Come on guys- This was my neighborhood gem...my go to place...Once my guy x's a place off that's it.  He said..from now on, if I eat there it will be alone. He did agree to try the new place of theirs..ONCE.",

    "text": "Very cute place inside. Food was good, but not great.  Service was pretty bad.  *No children's menu*  I ordered 2cheese enchiladas with an order of beans and rice. $12.99. I did enjoy everything, the sides of rice and beans were kinda small.  Zordon got the wet super burrito with green sauce. Rice, beans.  $13.99. The burrito was smaller than most and wasn't very good. My littles got the flautas combo.  $13.99.. because they didn't have a children's menu.  Service: they all looked sad. Like they didn't want to me there. We had to ask them for water several times. They weren't very attentive. Then they sat a family of about 15 right next to us. Really?? They have enough room to leave some space for us. Anyway. Then as we leave the hostesses weren't any better.   Decor was actually very cute. A little bit weird though, the obsession with Frida. Still, done well.   I would consider giving this place a second chance if the prices weren't so high for the kind of food i get in any average Mexican restaurant",

    "text": "First of all, as you can tell by my pic, I'm a latina, mexican to be exact, so when it comes to mexican food, no one beats grandma or mom's cooking.  I've yet to find AMAZING mexican food in Las Vegas which is pretty damn disappointing.  Casa Don Juan is near my downtown office so I've been several times.  Here's a little rundown as I've tried several things on the menu-  Chips and Salsa- the colorful dressed waitstaff bring out chips and salsa with black beans which is pretty awesome. Bonus points for the black beans fo sho!   Add a margarita on the rocks (with salt of course, hey, I said I was mexican. lol) and BAM!  You have one of my favorite snacks/appetizers.  Guacamole- I'm suuuper picky with my guacamole and pride myself on making the best.  Meh.  Enough said.  Caldo- for you gringos, that means soup.  Probably my favorite thing at Casa.  Served with homemade tortillas. Its pretty amazeballs!!!  Damn I wish I had some for breakfast right now. Big bowl with veggies, beef, and spice filled broth that is out of this world!  Most people sprinkle the top with fresh onions, cilantro, and lime. I hold the onions, but wow, definitely a tasty filling meal!  Tacos- unlike that disgusting place down the road Macayos, Casa's taco shells are homemade.  Filled with shredded chicken (or beef), lettuce and tomato...BOMB.  Enchiladas- pretty gross.  the sauce is runny and just doesn't have a good taste.  Actually their enchiladas get a big fat \"D-.\"  The only thing worse than Casa's enchiladas are when people make enchiladas with FLOUR tortillas instead of corn.  WHAAAAT??  Fail.  Chile Relleno- ugh, I hate when a place messes up a chile relleno. Its pretty filling, cheese is just right, but the awful sauce they suffocate that poor chile with is pure caca. See my above review on enchiladas.  Rice and beans- pretty impressive!  I'm probably the most picky when it comes to these two sides and I have to say, they're almost perfect.  Margaritas- awesome!  They get an extra star for their tasty drinks.  The only time I crave a margarita is with my chips and salsa, but these are done RIGHT. I also request a better tequila because tequila makes me SUPER feisty! I Know my limits. lol.  Service- always very fast and not to toot my own horn but the owner likes a pretty lady so yeah, I always get seated very fast.  Just saying because its so obvious! lol.    Prices- they've upped their prices over the last few years, so their specials are the way to go if you're trying to keep the cost down.  For good mexican I'll pay more, just not sure if this place is completely worth it.    Overall Casa Don Juan is decent.  I'm always up for suggestions on great mexican food.  I want AUTHENTIC.  No more messing around for this little mexi.",

The service has recently gone downhill and they now charge for their salsa. I find that to be absolutely absurd that a take-out order does not come with a side of salsa for free. Being that I'm a long-time customer you think that they would not up the price on salsa for me but that wasn't the case. I will no longer be eating there. I have never in my life been to a Mexican restaurant and charged for Salsa when I do a take out order. That's like ordering French fries and being charged for ketchup!!! Crazy! Sorry Casa Don Juan, you guys lost a great cu",

Vegetarians have the normal options - cheese enchiladas, cheese tamales, vegetarian burrito, tostadas.  Prices are normal for a Mexican restaurant, my two-item combo was $12.99, but the tamale combos are more expensive.  Two enchilada combos were $9.99.  Service was fast and friendly, I will definitely go here again if I am in Vegas and craving Mexican food.",

Later I ordered a patron margarita with salt along the rim. Instead of salt, my rim was covered in sugar. Yuck!!! The margarita mix itself was even a nightmare. Never bothered sending my margarita back because the waiter was hardly even around.   Ordered a wet burrito with green sauce. The food runner brought out my wet burrito with red sauce instead. Didn't bother sending it back because at this point I was done with waiting and was starving.   Only reason this place gets two stars is because their wet burrito was tasty despite having the wrong sauce.. Won't be back however.",

    "text": "Returned again for dinner before First Friday and enjoyed the nice evening October weather by sitting outside.   Service was a dud this time, with our one waiter and one busboy running all around town.  It took forever to get our order in, to get plates, to get our check, to pay for the bill, etc.  Service was just lacking altogether.  By the time we did get our plates (which we had requested early on), our food was not hot.  Reminders about more chips, beans, and salsa were forgotten.  Food was still good though!  Chips with warm refried beans and cheese and hot salsa are always a joy to munch on here.  Our party of three ordered a few dishes to share.  * Carnitas de Puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo ($8.99) - Generous amount of shredded pork.  More than enough for one person.  And it was moist and tasty, not dry at all.  * 3 Enchiladas de Pollo con arroz y frijoles ($9.99) - It was good, not my favorite of the bunch. I spent more time eating everything else.  We chose the chicken for all three, although you can get beef or cheese as well.  * Carne Asada (estilo Casa Don Juan) con arroz, frijoles y guacamole ($10.99) - A decent size piece of steak covered with onions.  It took forever to cut with the butter knife they give.  They either have to cut it in strips or give you a steak knife so you can cut into it better.  We also ordered three micheladas.  But the waiter said it's called something else when there's hot sauce in it.  I forgot.  Oh well.  But it was pretty good nonetheless.  There was a slight discrepancy with the bill where they charged us for another beer.  It's always a pain to find things added on your bill and having to get them to fix it.  So double check your bill when dining here.  Overall, it's still a great place for Mexican food with great atmosphere.  Wonderful people watching when sitting outside, but it always seems lively when I pop in to use the loo.  (Not sure how the atmosphere outside would be should it not be First Friday.)  3.5 stars.  (Pics posted from our dinner!)",

We ordered a beef fajita plate and shared it between two people. It was definitely enough food, as they give a lot of beef, but the quality of the meat was horrible. I also told the waiter it was my boyfriends birthday and they sang, which was nice, but gave him a plate of whip cream!! Very disappointed.",

    "text": "I was very impressed with this place after we ate here a few days ago. Sure it may not be in the best neighborhood, and it looks sorta cheesy from the outside. But don't judge a book by its cover.  The first thing I noticed when we entered was the amount of mexican people inside. No, not just the employees, but many of the patrons. You know its a good sign if you see the ethnicity of a restaurant frequenting it.   The chips were pretty good. Standard hard corn tortilla served with both salsa and bean dip. The dip was a bit bland but it tasted pretty pure. The salsa had plenty of flavorful salsa. Oh and the margaritas are pretty strong, which is nice I suppose. There's a woman who takes your picture and then tries to sell it back to you in a cheesy Vegas themed frame. A hilarious attempt to squeeze money out of a local.  The actual food did not disappoint. My girlfriends chimichanga was easily the best I've ever tasted. I opted for the bistecca ranchera. It was surely the best ranchers sauce I have ever had the pleasure if eating. The steak was well prepared if not a bit chewy. The rice was excellent, as was the guacamole. The flour tortillas were fluffy wnd singed just the way  I like em. I  could see this place earning a 5 from me, but I'll have to see how they do spicy food. Final verdict is pending but current evidence shows this place is a DO.",

We were seated in 2 minutes 27 seconds. HAHA!! Seriously.   They give you free chips and salsa...and bean dip! Bonus! The guacamole is a must have. So fresh.  Everything is good here.

I am EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that taking my family of four used to be around $40-45 with tip with 4 plates and water for each of us.  Now it's $60-$70 for the four of us for the same 4 plates and water for each of us.  My wife's plate used to be $8.99 for one taco, one enchilada, rice and beans.  Now it's $13.99 for the same plate!!!  Really Don Juans, it's necessary to charge it up $5 extra dollars for ONE plate?  I live in Henderson and would trek up to the north side of the strip for this and let's just say, NOT ANY MORE!!!  Very disappointed Don Juans, very disappointed!!!",

We popped in on a Saturday evening around 5pm.  We were seated right away and asked for 2 waters.  Our waitress took our order, 2 vegetarian burritos, one without cheese.  They arrived 2 minutes later.  That seals their fate for me.  That is a blinking sign that it is a conveyor belt restaurant.  No accommodation for quality, just slap the pre-cooked ingredients together and get the food out so the customer can scarf it down so we can clear the table and seat it again.  Don't worry about offering a nice atmosphere or enjoyable meal.  We asked the waitress for some salsa or red sauce to put on top of our burritos and she replied by glaring at us and saying what do you want - the salsa or red sauce.  For some reason it took way longer to get the red sauce then the actual entrees but when it did arrive it was accompanied by the bill.  Again, scarf the food, clear the table.  I had to request a refill on my water, sorry for putting her out with that request.  The bill reflected a $4 charge for the red sauce, nice!   I try to recognize the good even when it is overshadowed by the disappointing so I will say that the restrooms were clean.",

I believe it is some of the best Mexican food in town.   Lunch can get crowded so we usually get in around 1130 and are seated right away. Get the guac!! It is a little extra but totally worth it. I have never had bad service here and they are very attentive and the food comes out pretty fast. Not fast like microwave, but within a good amount of time for the amount of people they have sitting in there.   I usually get shredded beef tacos or enchiladas and the love the rice. Everything is just so yummy. Oh yah and the horchata, YUM! I had bad Mexican just days before I came last Friday so I definitely needed the right stuff!",

My sister and I went today as Monday and Wednesdays are albondiga soup days. FYI is really good. Well, though the flavor was still there we got like 3 albondigas (aka mexican style meatballs) from the usual 6 or 7!! It usually comes with flour or corn tortillas and a side of limes, cilantro and chopped onion. We had to ask for it this time. We actually got the chips and salsa before they brought out our waters too. The service used to be great. However, right now it was not what it was. I do have to say that at least when we went we didn't have to wait for a seat we got right in.  I will return as the soup I mentioned is really good despite the lack of the meatballs. They just added more veggies and that's alright by me as its healthier.  Just disappointed on their change and hope it goes back to what it used to be.  Ok, so I went again today, lol. It was a free lunch how could I refuse that? I ordered the vegetarian burrito without the tortilla and our waiter was so accomodating with my odd request. He brought me fresh chopped jalapenos and the extra spicy sauce. You have to ask for that one and they will charge you for it but, its really good.  My experience this time was much better which is the reason for the 4 stars this time. Maybe yesterday was an off day who knows. We'll see what happens next time",

The food is not toned down in respect to spiciness and if you like spicier (hotter) food just ask the waiter and they will prepare it for you. The attention to service we received from our waiter Jose was superb. We highly recommend Casa Don Juan. For those visiting Las Vegas, you will not regret dining there.

    "text": "**Summary**        - Service - The service was great. The waiter was took the initiative and answered all questions we had about the menu.        - Flavor - Perhaps it was what we ordered, but the food seemed mediocre. **Ordered**        - $12.99 Pescado (Veracruz style) - They deep fried a whole fish. It was definitely an experience. However, the fish seemed a bit bland (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=PJHl0-1lr3VutIljvJWAgg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/a192...</a>).        - $13.99 Carne Asada con Arroz, Frijoles y Guacomole - The carne asada was decent but a little dry (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=2jMekOanf6P9EuTiBzuh0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/a192...</a>).        - $2.50 Lengua (Beef Tounge) Taco - The meat was good. The only complaint was it was really spicy. I had to stop half way to take a break (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=YThhtM8r_BRfN3L56wfKGQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/a192...</a>).        - $2.75 Flan Napolitano - Made from scratch flan. It was delicious. **Recommendations**        - Out of all the restaurant style Mexican places, I'd rank this one pretty high. However, I think I'll stick to fast food Tacos El Gordo next time I'm feeling like tacos.",

My husband and I decided to grab a bite to eat at the bar while we played keno & blackjack, after finishing our meal we continued to gamble.  In the middle of a hand my machine completely blacked out, the bartender was able to cash out my money & I moved over to sit on my husbands lap and play his machine with him. About 10 minutes later an employee comes up to us & says that the owner is extremely upset & offended that I was sitting on my husbands lap & that I must move immediately. I am totally shocked & insulted!  We are not only sitting at the bar area but I am wearing sweat pants & an old t-shirt! Simply enjoying my husbands company while spending money I do not need to spend at this establishment, they neither comp drinks nor discount them for gambling. I am so insulted being chastised as if I am exhibiting obnoxious behavior. Shame on this business.  I informed the server that was sent over to tell us that I would never return to this establishment ever ever again, 5 minutes later a busser is sent over to inform us that the owner is \"truly\" sorry If the apology was sincere the owner would have came to apologize in person since he/she took it upon him/herself to insult us personally.  We are locals here in las vegas, working in the service industry & owning our own business we know what customer service is & the level of disrespect that was exhibited at this establishment is unacceptable to not only myself but to anyone in the las vegas area.",

Also, I normally don't like horchata, but the best ones I've had so far was this place, the Bacchanal Buffet and at my work. I like when the Horchata isn't strong in spices, but more creamy and smooth. Also, the chips, bean dip, salsa and guacamole are to die for. I can't stop eating it because it's so good. They need a location in California, OC and LA. :D",

The margaritas are okay... very large in size, but nothing spectacular in taste. This same theme repeated itself with our meal..... very large portions, but nothing spectacular in taste. The chips, salsa, and beans were pretty good but chips aren't warm or exceptionally fresh. The salsa was fresh but had no spice to it at all. I had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada with rice and beans.... it was okay... not bad.... not really anything to get excited about. My husband had the whole fried fish (tilapia). He said it was good. Our friends ordered the chicken fajitas and the steak fajitas. The portions are very large, but again flavors are bland, nothing seemed very fresh. It was just very ordinary and quite flavorless. There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas that I just can't see myself coming back to Casa Don Juan again.",

Had to ask for water THREE times and when the check came she said we had to pay up front at the register which was never the case in the past. While at the register, two other waiters came up with money/credit cards for other customers to settle their bills for them.   The food was good as always and the margaritas were yummy as well (although I asked for NO salt on the rim but got salt anyway). Unfortunately the waitress was so bad that I'll think twice about coming here again. There are other good Mexican restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "There were a lot of problems with this place. After repeating my order three times because my waiter just couldn't get it right, my order still came out wrong. I notice the waiter struggle with taking my order so I repeated my order in Spanish (not bc I'm racist - for that person that felt the need to attack me on that) but because I had no problem being patient and making sure he got my order right. And he managed to mess up the table next to us (maybe he was new?) We went at a time that wasn't busy but felt he was all over the place but couldn't really manage to get anything right.   How does a Mexican restaurant get Tacos so wrong? This place manages to do just that. The food itself was horrible. We came here as it was highly recommended to be the best Mex Restaurant in Vegas but were highly disappointed w the food itself.   And to top it off we had to wait a very long time to get our check. Only reason we left a tip was for the bus boys who manages to keep up with our refills. Our waiter just took our orders, managed to screw our orders and we had to track him down for our check. (Not exaggerating - my husband had to track him down bc he neglected to come by our table to check on us) If you are looking for a decent Mex Restaurant than try to avoid this place. It sucks!  As some are offended for my review then just ignore it and go because you enjoy this place so much. I write my review based on MY experience and don't appreciate haters hating bc they don't agree. YELP is meant to voice your opinion on businesses as everyone has different experiences.   Fortunately, I've had great Mexican food and I don't believe this was one of them. Forget about the bad service we received but the food was just not good.",

Friends and I went on a Sunday afternoon craving and I mean craving a good bowl of menudo.   1) Right of the bat we were told they didn't have any more and ran out at noon!  Ahh I can go to any burrito stand and get some on Sunday all day long! Come on I was expecting better than that from Don Juans!  2) Our server decided to give us extra time to rethink our choices.  We still wanted to stay and eat.  But instead of taking 5 min he took 20 to come back to our table!  3) The bus boy refilled our waters and chips while  still waiting for our server!  4) Once we got our orders in we were not disappointed.    But seriously Don Juan please don't leave us hanging like that no more!  I mean this is a tradition for me so don't screw it up.",

Although the lady at the front was kinda rude, she was the only one the rest of the night that was.  Everyone from the hostess, to the many waiters checking on us, were all super friendly and accommodating.  I ordered the jumbo Cadillac margarita, and my friend got a frozen mixed mango and strawberry margarita. Check out the picture. It was so pretty!   We got chips, salsa, and beans when we first sat down. The salsa was not the best I ever had, but it was good and I loved that it was actually spicy. Then we ordered cheese dip and guacamole to go with it. The cheese was good, and the guacamole was delicious. However, this was a mistake, because when we were into our second basket of chips, we realized we were too full for our meal.  We had ordered the mixed appetizer for two, which was $20. Surprisingly everything on the plate was good. It had chicken chimichangas, beef flautas, carne asada nachos and quesadillas. It was way too much food, but we had to at least try everything....it was all good, so needless to say, we were stuffed.  After we finished our drinks, the waiters rolled us out to the curb for a cab pick up.  I will definitely be back!!!",

Instead, I will Uber it to Casa Don Juan and have a outstanding Mexican meal.  I took my family to Casa Don Juan in July 2016, and we all loved our meal and experience.    The restaurant is located about 1 mile from the Downtown Fremont street.  From the Strip is was a $6 Uber ride, and worth the ride.  The restaurant has a great old school decor and ambience.  There is a lot of Frida Kahlo pictures and art on the walls.  The service was fantastic, very friendly, professional and helpful.  After being seated you are given free chips, salsa and bean dip.  Something that you have to pay extra for at all the Mexican restaurants on the Strip.  The Chips and dips are very good.  The margaritas are large, delicious and you can tell they put a fair amount of tequila in the drinks.    The margaritas are about $10.  The food tasted delicious and fresh.  Everyone loved they way their meal tasted.  The portion size was perfect.  Enough to fill you up, but not make you sorry you ate the last bite.  The prices were very reasonable, especially when considering the quality and portion size.  You'll get so much more for your money, compared to restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.  Our bill was about $75 for four dinners, 2 margaritas, and desert.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be having dinner at Casa Don Juan.  I would also encourage all of my family and friends to enjoy this great restaurant.",

    "text": "This restaurant is the worst restaurant I've been to so far the worst customer service! Me and my boyfriend were on vacation this past weekend and I decided to buy the 2 lunch entrees (up to $10.99 each) on Groupon I love Groupon they always have amazing deals anyways so me and my boyfriend had never been to LV so that's why we decided to buy that Groupon special. We start heading to the restaurant first of all I'm going to start off by the location is dangerous so much crime and just really sketchy and dangerous in general, so we go inside kindly ask the hostess that we had purchased a Groupon special & if we could take out instead of dining in we didn't want to be there too long since the location was very dangerous & the hostess rudely said no so I said okay that's fine I don't like being rude or disrespectful so I said never mind we will just dine in and they rudely sat us down never asked for our drink nothing they sent like 4 different servers because I guess nobody wanted to be our server they were all rude as soon as we mentioned the Groupon special we had purchased left & never came back to our table! Finally another different server came by and asked for our drink 30min later & the same thing happened when I mentioned the Groupon special he left never came back and I'm Latina so I understand Spanish and I over heard all of the servers  judging us, talking about how we wanted our food for free and we were broke when I had showed all of the our Groupon voucher and nobody has a right to tip if you feel like they aren't doing they're job as an employee! We wouldn't go to a damn restaurant knowing we don't have money like it's common sense I'm not stupid they were making fun saying oh im not serving them \"cheap assholes\" just being really disrespectful and judgmental for no reason so my boyfriend and I got up walked out really upset and disappointed & I'm not over exaggerating or being an ass because Ive worked the restaurant industry for over 4 years so I know how to be a server, host, and manager and let me tell you this restaurant does not know how to run a business! I don't even know how they are still in service I'm very disappointed! My first time in LV was the worst experience ever! Don't recommend this restaurant at all!!!!!",

It was a gift card to their actual restaurant, too.  It was only a few dollars difference and people were behind me wanting to check out, so I didn't feel like arguing - but on principle it is just wrong. They got the full amount of money from my friend when the gift card was purchased, but they wouldn't apply the full amount to my bill.  Trying to question it was met with shrugs  and \"It is not much difference, I don't know why, but it isn't much difference.\" Well, it wasn't much difference, but it was wrong all the same. Especially when they acted like they didn't understand what computer error or whatever it was had happened, when I watched quite clearly and saw quite clearly on the receipt that she had entered a different amount into the computer than what the total of the gift card was.  It was that simple.",

The tacos, taquitos, and enchiladas are second to none! I could sit here and go down the menu and be very hard pressed to think of another place in town that does it better. Today, our server was Ivan. A real gentleman. He got my wife's (very detailed and particular) order perfect with a smile, as opposed to the eye roll you migjt het somewhere else. If i could give him 5 stars as well, I would. So my suggestion is you do yourself a favor and check out Casa Don Juan when you're in the mood for good Mexican food. I prefer the one on Main Street to the one on Buffalo but they are both good",

I usually judge Mexican restaurants off their Chilaquiles as a lot of restaurants do not put much effort into this dish & they were DELICIOUS! Green chilaquiles is always the way to go, they were not soggy or too crunchy they were perfect. It was \"brunch\" so we ordered some micheladas as well, very yummy as well! I love Mexican restaurants that try to stay as traditional and authentic as possible & this one was a gem!",

Restaurant - came here on a Saturday night and maybe something was wrong with the A/C that night but it was sooo hot! Add to that a crowded room and you've got yourself an oven!   Service - fast and attentive enough considering how busy they were that night.  Food - we ordered the steak fajitas, wet burrito, and mango margaritas. Chips and salsa and bean dip are served before the main meals. Overall food was good! Definitely what you would expect from a Mexican place - greasy and unhealthy but very satisfying. I could've easily shared my fajitas, but since we had a Groupon, we went ahead and redeemed what it was good for. Margaritas were a bit strong. We didn't finish them.   Overall- I would recommend this  for an authentic Mexican meal if you're on this side of town. I just hope in my next visit, they've got the a/c fixed by then.",

    "text": "Team building is always great for bringing your coworkers and building a positive team and family spirit among employees. On this day, we decided to have an event at the Plaza hotel bingo hall, which turned out to be a flop. Although no one won that day, we sure did build up an appetite. The choices were Thai or Mexican. Mexican won, so our boss told us about this family owned local joint down the road from the Plaza. I'm always up for the opportunity to Yelp a new restaurant, this was no different.  Driving down Main St, you'll see the restaurant on the right hand side, adorn with exposed rock walls. There's a small parking lot in the back or street parking, but get there early so you can secure a spot. When you walk in, the website says you're treated to \"home-like Mexican setting.\" It's more like a Mexican Quinceanera threw up! The walls are a bright canary yellow, the ceiling is lined with hanging colored paper, cut with different designs. Definitely looks like an outdated joint but somehow, that's their character and it seems to work. Our server was passable. Didn't really converse with us and we ended up waiting  a long time for out check at the end. Thank goodness I was surrounded with great company!  For dinner, I decided to get the number 10 on the dinner menu, Carnitas de puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo for $11.99. This dish is pork, guacamole, rice, beans and pico de gallo. For some reason, Mexican prepared pork is always a winner in my book. This pork was nicely prepared, shredded and nicely marbleized. The meat was tender, however, drowned in oil. The saving grace was definitely the mild, yet flavorful taste. The rice was a nice dry compliment to the dish and help to soak up the juices from the pork. I thought the pico brought a fresh taste to the dish and who doesn't love guac! Overall, this dish was great.  At the end of the day, I would say I'm more of a 3.5 out of 5 stars for this place.I appreciate it's history and character, however, I feel like some things could be updated. Aside from the mediocre service, I would say the rest of the evening was a delightful one. I'm glad that it's close to work. For that alone, I wouldn't mind coming back again for another crack at it!",

    "text": "OK guys let me start off by saying until just about 3 years ago I have lived in Orange and Los Angeles Counties.  I was born and raised in So Cal. I have done my grocery shopping at Mercado's.  I've had many a drunken, reckless, eat till you burst and drink till you puke night in baja.  I have smuggled fireworks and Cuban, or what I was told were, Cuban cigars across the border and yes, I have most likely eaten dog or donkey tacos in Tijuana.  So If I am well versed enough to speak my mind about anything it would be Mexican food.  With all that being said...On with the review.  My quest for good humble Mexican food in the Vegas valley has been 3 years in the making and time after time I have been disappointed.  This place however was good.  It was not bad but it was not out of this world fantastic.  I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada 3 tacos, one carne asada, one al pastor, and one lengua to get a full range of flavors.  The lengua was pretty damn good moist, tender and flavorful, the same goes for the pastor it had good flavor, good texture and the taste was pretty impressive.  Now this was not the case with the asada.  The carne asada taco was dry and overcooked I would like to think I just got a bad batch but who knows.    OK on to the ceviche. The ceviche was again not fantastic but better than just average.  I would like to have seen whole shrimp instead of the diced pieces of shrimp that they used here .  There was also a lot of diced tomatoes to act as filler.  If this same exact restaurant was located in Long Beach, CA I most likely would have given it 3 stars instead of 4, but considering the number of bad experiences I've had in Vegas, Casa Don Juan has acted as a glimmer of hope and provided this Californian a taste of home.",

First off, we ordered margaritas at $15 a pop.  Watered down drool!  No flavor, and where was the Tequila?  Food was lukewarm.  I had cold tacos.  My dh had tasteless enchiladas.  Friends had cold flautas and chile rellenos. It all tasted like 1960s TV dinners.  And, it was expensive!  $13.99 for two tacos and a dollop of canned re-fried beans and rice!  Save your money and eat at Taco Bell....It's better!",

Very wide array of tequilas for you to punish your liver with and they know how to break out a margarita.

All in all if yelp allowed half stars i would rank this 3 1/2, however based on the service I will say 4. However,  decent Mexican food, authentic or gringo, is hard for me to find in Las Vegas. I like that this place gives bean dip with their chips and their entrees (ranging typically from $12-16) are pretty good with decent portion size. They have a touristy decor. Also, they generally offer 3 lunch specials around $9. They draw a big downtown lunch crowd but service is quick at lunch. Parking can be hard, they have a lot out back but it is sometimes full then I am left to find parking down the street and hike in.",

Extremely big and tasty meals, very fast service, attentive waitress etc. seems to be standard there. We lived in Vegas at Stratosphere and were little unsure during our walk there - neighbourhood is not among the most pretty in the city, you walk past several used cars joints and repair shops, the street lights were off....but it all ended when we entered the Casa. The only thing I would change (at least for this particular evening) was the guitarist - although he seemed pretty skilled, mood of his songs wasn't very encouraging. I thought his songs should be more lively.  Go there and don't worry, you will fell well there.",

If we ever go back, we'll request Walter and leave the kids at home. They charge too much for the kids in my opinion anyway. They seem to be discouraging families from dining there and with food as good as they serve they can probably afford to alienate us.",

My only complaint would be that the strawberry margarita, which I paid an extra $3 for (upgraded from the on-the-rocks lime margarita that came with the Groupon), was the most bland, watery margarita I've ever had. When I ordered it, the server warned me that the regular margarita was better. I should've listened to him, because boy was he right! I tried the regular margarita as well, and it was good. For some reason, the strawberry one tasted like ice with a hint of bland strawberry flavor. Couldn't taste any tequila at all! But the food was decent (great for the price). I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which is probably my favorite food of all time. They were good. For the price, I'd come back to order them again.",

    "text": "Man, I really wanted to like the house that Don Juan built partially because I want there to be really amazing restaurants downtown and partially because I've always thought it looked so festive. From the outside, it often looks as if it is glowing. As you know, I love an atmosphere that makes a statement, and I can definitely appreciate festive.  I went for dinner with a group after a talk at the Historic 5th Street School. It is an adorable little place with bright walls, tiled floors and lots of wall flare. Although we arrived only an hour before they were closing, the servers were welcoming. There were only a couple of other tables of diners.  The server brings salsa, bean dip and chips to the table. I would say that all were average. My friends had eaten at Don Juan before, and one ordered the chile relleno based on his previous experience. My other friend ordered two tacos, and I ordered a plate with one taco and one tamale.   Perhaps I ordered poorly because the taco was solid, but the tamale was sad. Sad tamales are really sad. It was a weird diameter--I know that is an odd comment, but it was like a toilet paper roll, but a little shorter. I like a flatter tamale because it prevents them from drying out. Don Juan's tamale was very dry, and there was a lot of dough, not too much filling. Plus, it was lukewarm at best. I guess most of this could have been the result of it being a late in the day tamale. However, even early in the day it would have still been the same diameter with the same fillings, so, naaaah, I think it was simply a sad, little tamale. Hence, my sad little two stars.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I rarely leave negative reviews for restaurants, let alone rate them 1 star, but I feel that I need to share my experience at Casa Don Juan.  I've visited Casa Don Juan several times. I usually order a margarita and chips and dip, because their food has never seemed too appetizing or authentic to begin with.  After my last visit, I will NEVER return, not even if I am thirsty.   I ordered a fish ceviche tostada and was served FROZEN, actually, Frostbit, shredded tilapia on a tortilla shell.  As soon as I saw it, I questioned the waiter on what kind of fish they used for their ceviche as well as how they prepared it.  The waiter did not know, so I waited, and waited for an answer.  After thirty minutes with no response, I inspected it and confirmed the fish was frozen.  I then personally walked the dish to the kitchen and questioned the cooks as to what I was being served.  They confirmed it was frozen fish with lime juice, but that they'd be happy to make me another one. Seriously? They offered a shrimp ceviche, to which I replied \"Is the shrimp frozen too?\", sort of jokingly.  They didn't lie and said that too was frozen shrimp with lime juice. But that they could go back and check that the shrimp was defrosted all the way!  \"NO, Thanks!\"     This is definitely not authentic ceviche, which they should disclose, but that is not even what I am complaining about. These were not even chunks of fish, it was the scraps of frozen bits you find at a bottom of a bag of frozen fish.  Why would you serve that to your customers?  If you are out of something on the menu, your customers prefer you tell them you're all out and not being served scraps of frozen bits of fish.  Or maybe it always looks this way.  Is making $8 dollars on the sale worth it?  Needless to say, I highly recommend you DO NOT order ceviche, fish or shrimp, at Casa Don Juan.   I haven't had much else there, like I said before but this is one of those things that is unforgivable when it comes to food.  If I could rate zero stars, I would.  Also, I paid my bill 100%, because they still charged me for this food.  I was with my niece and nephew and they ordered burritos, and were charged and extra $1.50 for sour cream and another $1.50 for cheese, per burrito.  That's just ridiculous. The waiter said it would come out of his check if we did not pay for it when I started complaining, so I just paid for it as to not cause a scene.  What a joke!",

I love mexican food and eat it all the time living down in San Diego, but I was very surprised to find the best tamale I have ever eaten at a place just off the vegas strip.  I tried the cheese and jalapeno tamale.  The masa was moist and flavorful and there was a perfect amount of filling.  I also had an awesome vegetarian burrito (only like $5) that was simple and delicious.  I got a side of mole to dip it in, as I love to do with any place that has mole,  it was very good.  As you know, moles vary quite a bit.  This one was dark, smokey, and had a stronger balance towards a rich pepper flavor as opposed to a sweeter chocolate one.    They start you off with some great salsa and a bean dip with chips.  Love it!  I only regret not trying a margarita from this place.",

When it came to the guacamole... it seemed like it had been put through a blender. Perhaps I like my guacamole and salsa on the chunky side so to each their own. The chicken mole was once again good but not great. For fifteen dollars a person I would rather eat like a king at a mom and pop Mexican restaurant where there's a little more grease and a lot more flavor.  Overall I feel like this is a very refined (bland) Mexican restaurant. Their food is good but by no means amazing. Then again a lot of people tell me how delicious Robertos is... So I guess if that passes for authentic Mexican to some people then I can definitely see how people would be blown away by this place.",

When it was sent back I suspect it was brought back to me after having just been run through a blender and having ice added to it. Pretty much just tasted like ice. Food was fast, but blah and then we had to wait 30 minutes for our check. Finally, after paying at the register I was waiting for my partner to go to the bathroom and our waiter came up to see how much he got tipped. I don't think he realized that I was the person standing right there. You just waited on us! What the hell? Overall- don't do it if you can avoid it.",

CHips and salsa are fantastic, but ne sure to try the cheese dip! THAT IS THE BEST!  Everything there is amazing and I am TICKLED that a new location is opening out Northwest closer to me!   The most amazing thing I have noticed at Casa is that no matter what you order or when, they bring fresh, HOT food to the table QUICKLY! Must be some magic going on back in that kitchen!",

I think they forgot to order salt for the kitchen. The service was exceptional though.  Bland food aside, the atmosphere here was quite festive.The colorful and eccentric chandeliers in the bar were my favorite.  I love that they do karaoke every night of the week, but I didn't stay long enough to wait for it to begin.The service was attentive and thoughtful. I ordered the shrimp burrito (of course it wasn't on the menu, but whenever I'm at a Mexican restaurant I always order a burrito with seafood), and my sweetie ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas combo plate.   The food is served just as you would expect at a Mexican restaurant: with a heaping helping of rice and beans on the side, and the sauces would have been fantastic if they had just added SALT to the dishes.   The jumbo  Cadillac margaritas were included in the deal, and boy were they delicious!   With the Groupon deal this place was a great bargain. I'll be back again for the karaoke,  and hopefully they'll supply the chef with some salt for the food next time.",

Right when we got to the table we got chips, beans, guacamole and salsa.   My advise is get al carte, that way you can try a few things.  I got a tamale and it was amazing! So if you try anything then get the tamale, they make them onsite. I also got a fish taco and it was good. Awesome and strong margartias!   They do have outsite seating but who in their right mind would want to sit in the dead heat when they can sit inside.  I will definately come back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "We had never been here before, but it's seriously all anyone talks about when you mention you'd like to grab some Mexican. We were walking through the Arts District and there it was - so we figured, why not?  Why not....is the question I ask when I realize we've wasted 3 years NOT eating here! This place is awesome! You can sit inside or out, your preference, and inside is fantastically bright, vibrant, and energetic. The waitstaff is QUICK. 'Let me get you a drink' 'Here are your complimentary chips, salsa and beans' 'What can I get you today?' They are speedy and friendly, and wonderful. A man even came over and took a complimentary photo of us...of which he then tried to sell us extra copies - we declined - but it was fun to have a Valentine's Day pic of us at a random Mexican joint :)   The menu is intense - so try to either use a Yelp review ahead of time or at least have some clue as to what you're looking for before cracking it open. There are bright colorful photos that represent what the food looks like - and it actually does. ...and the photos aren't repulsive - which is a bonus!  I'm telling you for real, that within 5 minutes of ordering, our food was at the table. I had enough time to check into Yelp and ask my husband what he thought of the place and our food arrived. I was honestly shocked. The waiter said it oftentimes surprises him. The food was great. I got the #9 which was 3 chicken floutas, rice and beans. The floutas were HOT - yes, like they were just prepared. Crispy tortilla and succulent chicken with a kick - I didn't want to stop eating them, alas they disappeared quickly. The. rice. was. amazing. So delicious!! And guys - I do not like refried beans...except I ate all of them on this day. Yes. They were awesome! My husband got 2 chicken tacos, rice and beans and he nearly licked his plate. He kept saying over and over that he would definitely be returning to consume more food. ...and when Mikey's happy, Brooke is happy.   The bill only ran us $28.10 - I think that's pretty legit for a delicious meal that we couldn't find anything wrong with. We'll definitely be back, and can't wait to try the margaritas cuz they looked b o m b.",

    "text": "I used to love this place, however today was the utmost worst customer service I have ever received in any establishment.   My friends and I went for a breakfast as we have done several times before. We all ordered Michelada's they charged us ala cart for each one. Two of them were $11.50 which used Tecate beer and the other was $9.00 because it was made with bud light. That was the first strike.  We were never told they were ala cart.   Two of us ordered the Chilaquiles. I asked to have chorizo added and the server said \"no problem\".  The server then asked my friend if he wanted carne asada, he said no and asked for Carnitas. Again, his reply was no problem.   Food arrived, my eggs were under cooked so I sent them back. No problem. The food was just ok. Nothing like it usually is.   When the bill arrived we were shocked to see that the Michelada's were charged for each component of the drink. We were also charged an additional $10.99 each for the additional meat added to the Chiliquiles. The price on the menu was $10.99 for them so we questioned why were were charged $20.99 for an $11.00 dish. The response was due to adding meat to the dish. We asked how much is a side of either chorizo and or carnitas and they said $5.00.  So we asked why were charged double. They had no good reason. I asked the server why he never mentioned the ridiculous up charges and he said it wasn't his fault. Oh yes it was. It's his responsibility of a server to mention any up charge. He should have mentioned it when taking the order. Had I known it was so much we wouldn't have ordered it.   I have no problem paying for additional meat but to double the price of the dish and have no good reason was absurd. We asked for a manager and the hostess quickly replied he wasn't there. I find that hard to believe that you have a functioning restaurant with no manager in the building.   They made no attempt to clearly explain the double charge instead of the quoted $5.00. They made no attempt to help rectify the bill. We agreed to pay for the meat but not double. They didn't care.    We will never go there again or recommend this place.   Utterly ridiculous.",

We trekked over here after planning on having lunch at Esther's Kitchen, only to find that the kitchen wouldn't make food after 3pm (we arrived at 3:05). We ordered a Huge shrimp cocktail (and devoured it) and two of their house margaritas. They have a great array of drinks and just for the base margarita they have over a dozen flavor modifications. I had the watermelon jalapeno marg and my husband had just a jalapeno marg. Both were refreshing and tasty (I liked the play of sweet and spice in mine a bit better though). Then we had two tamale plates, one with an enchilada and the other with a Chile relleno. Everything was delicious and the portions were substantial. The portraits of Frida Kahlo everywhere were very cool, but nothing beat the Frida 'Zoltar' machine they have!

We made a wrong assumption.    The parking lot looked pretty intimidating because of the tow signs so plastered all over the place. We were seated and the waitress came by shortly to greet us and take our drink orders. We didn't decide yet so we asked for waters in the meantime.    At least 15 minutes went by and she never came back. I really want to leave at that point. Finally we flag another server to get our waitress. She finally shows up and takes our order.   We ordered 2 lunch specials and 2 horchatas. The lunch specials came with a salad. It was the cheapest ingredients they could find. They made the salads swim in dressing. It was really disgusting. I couldn't eat it.  Horrible just horrible.  The entrees were out pretty quickly.  The tacos were generic tasting.  The refried beans are the ones from the can and the rice was bland. I don't understand why they name themselves \"authentic,\" because it's far from it. Anyways we had to ask for our drinks to another server. Why am I not surprised? The staff must of been taking a siesta at that time.  This place is a disaster. Not sure how they have 4 stars. Maybe they told their whole family to write a good review on their behalf. Worst Mexican food I've had in my life.",

    "text": "Great Mexican food at a great price. My bf and I always try to eat healthy, and Mexican food is often a challenge in that department, but we've found a few go-to dishes that are on the healthier side and delicious: the chicken mole, the siete mares seafood soup, and the fajitas. (We substitute the refried beans for whole beans and try to avoid doing the chips/salsa if we can.) We've been here a handful of times and the food and service have been consistently excellent. You can often find a groupon as well for added value.  I know this restaurant is popular with tourists, particularly for their margaritas, but don't ignore the great food. Locals, I recommend that you come at slightly off times to avoid the crowds. We often go around 11:30a for an early lunch and never have to wait.   The Frida Calho, Zapata, and Pancho Villa themes, along with the decor and music, give this restaurant a lively and colorful environment.",

We ordered our food at that time and had to wait another 30 minutes to get our food which was cold. We were at the restaurant for over 2 hours and our waiter only came to our table twice to take our food/drink order and to drop off the check. By far the worst service I have ever experienced and the food was mediocre at best. NEVER coming here again!",

As we patiently wait we see chaos on the front to seat people.  People walking in asking for waiters and being seated before people that have been waiting.  There are no reservations at this place.  Upset people complaining for being told wait is only a certain time but well over 20 mins from the time they were told.  Seemed like if you complained they would find you a table regardless if you were next.  We were finally sat after waiting 50-55 mins.  Mind you we were originally told 20 mins.  Then we are about to order and the item we wanted was not available anymore.  We also asked if the item was still available once we got there and they told us yes.  Terrible experience and I really hope it's not like this all the time now.",

Not the biggest deal in the world- now I'll be calling the restaurant to see what can be done.  Five-star service and five-stars for the Frida Kahlo decor.

The romance is very authentically Mexican, very homey, and had great service. Their guacamole with the chips tasted fresh and vibrant. My date got the Chilaquiles Verde con Huevos and it was amazing; the spice level was nice and the plate was very balanced. I got the Huevos con Chorizo which was to die for. You cannot go wrong with chorizo and this was definitely amazing. Make sure to get some flour tortilla for that rustic bite of chorizo, eggs, and beans; it was amazing. Definitely coming back to check out more of their menu and experience authentic Mexican food in a restaurant.",

    "text": "This place is perfect when you're buzzing around downtown in the Arts District! The area is pretty awesome. I was there during a First Friday event. The weather was perfect, the people were friendly and the local artists were in their best form! We have some talented people in Las Vegas. I love the lifestyle too. Some of the art studios were so cool. The setup was studio/living space. Okay, enough about the Arts District, this is supposed to be a review on Casa Don Juan.   The location is ideal! The restaurant is huge! The decor appears to be authentic, but I wouldn't know. I've never visited Mexico. Lol! I'd love to visit Baja one day though!  When you walk in, there are two booths/counters. One is situated to the side of the entrance and one across from the entrance, so it's a bit confusing. No one greets you, so you have to figure out who to speak with in order to put your name on the list. No big deal. We figured it out. We did notice that we were seated long before a couple that arrived before us, although we noticed after we finished eating. Yes, they were still waiting after we completed our meals. Ugh.  The menu is very typical when compared to other Mexican Restaurants. The food is very good, but I would rate it as average when compared to other Mexican restaurants. There are two other restaurants that I would rate much higher in regards to taste and presentation. On the other hand, there is one particular Mexican restaurant, with a big name, that I would rate as lower. Hence, the average rating.  So would I visit this place again?!!! Yes, if I were in the arts district and I wanted to eat Mexican. With that in mind, there are many other restaurants downtown that I'd like to try as well. Please note; I would NOT drive in from the burbs just to eat at this place. Overall, it's fun! Give it a try!",

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who took our name and stated it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. About 15 minutes later we were called to be seated. We were led to a booth and handed menus. Upon perusing the extensive menu, we decided to order the taco and enchilada combo meal with rich and beans. While we waited for our lunch to be prepared: we looked at the extensive art work featuring Frida Kahlo. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and is very inviting. The restrooms were clean and the restaurant was clean.  Our meals were delicious. The tacos were delightful. Inside each corn shell was tender beef with cheese and shredded lettuce. The enchiladas were filled with cheese and yummy goodness. The Spanish rice and retried beans were good too! We will definitely return in the near future to try some of their other entrees.",

They offer a variety of flavored margaritas. My sister ordered the lavender margarita, which I've never had or heard of. Now that drink was interesting, yet surprisingly good!  Chips and salsa (they also give you refried beans as a dip) was equally good.  I will definitely return whenever I'm in Vegas!",

Maybe I'm spoiled from Mexican food from SoCal but this place is just not cutting it - Vegas or not.",

The service is on there game especially when it is someone's birthday. Beware of the \"hat\"! Haha. They have lunch time prices but that doesn't stop them from serving big portions for lunch. Food is never disappointing when we come here and we have visited this restaurant numerous times for birthdays and for good Mexican food during our lunch breaks. There is parking in back of the restaurant and across the street which you don't have to pay for. It does get busy so just be prepared.",

My experience:  Restaurant: Its located downtown in the Art District and the building looks nice, but parking is hard to find. When you first walk in, you're greeted and have to wait in a crowded sitting area. The restaurant is medium size, but crowded and feels like they dont have A/C. Interior design is really nice, they use artist Frida as their logo, unique concept.   Food:  The rice and beans were pretty good, compared to most mexican restaurants in Vegas. My sister ordered mix sea food plate which was good and me and my boyfriend ordered steak which was tender and well done. (4 stars)  Experience:  The waiter which name starts with C, ends with Z. Lol was not very pleasant, he took which seem forever to take our order for drinks (sis and I are pregnant) and he got our order wrong and didnt being all drinks. I didnt like that hr didnt stop by for refills, only after food arrived. It was hot and we were in their for 2 hours, once we left they decided to turn on AC. (Smh). Also, their fountain drinks taste horrible and they give you water that tastes horrible, like sink water.   Would I come back? No, I wouldn't because it's crowded and first time service was not that great. Although I would recommend to single people who want to drink and eat some decent mexican food.",

Your food was very far from authentic and sadly dissappointing.  disguised by waitstaff dressed in traditional clothing and abuelita making tortillas a mano(like nasty Lindo Michoacan(barf sound)  John's House builds your anticipation up only to let you down in the end. So we got the Guacamole to start, Wifey ordered the Mole de Pollo and I ordered the Chile Relleno/Chicken Enchilada combination plate.  Guacamole-The version that I whipped up at The Yelpmazing Race in under a minute tasted better, and Horchata is from the machine, not homemade.  Chile Relleno-one of my benchmarks for authenticity, no stringy, cheesy goodness, but a weird brown(overcooked?) firm cheese that had a texture like a VERY firm tofu in a barely in-tact chile held by a bunch of toothpicks, very disappointing.(How bout a throwdown Bobby Flay Style?)Enchilada was aight.  Chicken Mole-We're expecting bone-in chicken pieces, but instead, fricken chicken fajita strips double as the meat for the Mole. Even worse, the spice, sweetness, and smokiness from the sauce tastes kinda off with a tanginess like a barbecue sauce!?!?!  Unfinished entrees, and totally dissappointed, a strong fishy odor permeated the dining room from a fried fish that was being delivered to the table next to us(feel sorry for that next victim) It was time for us to say adios for good....ALOHA!!!",

Our food came out fresh and fast!! I couldn't believe how fast or lunch was on the table...the place was hit with a nice lunch rush and our server had everything under control. I ordered the tamale and taco combo. The tamale was just okay...the masa was a bit to thick for my liking. But nothing to gripe about.   Also ordered a blended mango margarita.

The waiter didn't seem surprised when I handed it back to him.   We all ordered combo plates. BF got 2 enchiladas with green sauce, they brought him red sauce. It was corrected quickly. Mom got the taco place and I had the flautas. Nothing stood out.  I think the prices are too high for the quality and quantity you are given.  The one thing that irked me was that they charged me $3 for a little cup of chili sauce, and I mean little. I asked them if they had spicy salsa cuz the stuff they served with the chips had no kick. So the waiter brought me a little cup of chili sauce. This isn't something I would be charged for in Los Angeles so it didn't even cross my mind to ask. I was surprised when I saw the $2.99 on the check, but I did ask for it so....... Lesson learned.  The best part about this place was the outdoor seating.",

The waitresses are eager to push increasingly low quality guacamole on you and if you turn it down they really can't be bothered by you.  However, the food has remained really consistent.  The portions have shrunken a little bit on more expensive items (Fillet Veracruz), and when produce gets expensive they certainly cut corners...but if you know these things and order accordingly, you'll have a solid meal.  The pitchers of Hornitos margaritas don't hurt, either.  Really, if the service and the produce conditions increased, this restaurant would get 5 stars.",

    "text": "Sometimes a well-planned coincidence is just what you need.  Yes, I realize that the word planned coincidence is an oxymoron, an oxymoron like Casa Don Juan.  First of all, the decor looks a little too festive and forcefully Mexican.  Any Mexican joint with that many framed photos of Frida, well, has something to prove.  Second of all, I ended up there as a result of an odd calculation with a close girlfriend who lives across town, as it so happens, Casa Don Juan seems the exact middle point of distance for us.  With such contrived factors in play, I expected the food to disappoint.  What a pleasant surprise Don Juan was!  The frigid January evening in the Vegas dessert is off to a fun start with really good live Mariachi music, the soft and painfully romantic kind of Mariachi that makes any woman wish she was living life with a South-of-the-Border lover, or maybe just with Mariachi music as the soundtrack.  A request for black beans (a blessing and curse from P90X nutrition plan) ends up with a waiter's \"no\" response, accompanied by the \"this is authentic Mexican, we don't do healthy\" glance.  However, he was nice enough to give me whole beans before they refry them in lard.  Beans were good, rice was good, tortilla was warm, and good.  But the mole sauce on the chicken was, well, a perfect reminder of my college crush on Mexican culture.  Flavorful spices and a hint of chocolate left heat on my tongue to be remembered.  So now I'm listening to La Paloma Negra by Lila Downs for the rest of the evening, the things that good mole will do to you!",

It sounds like fraud to me. Wait a minute...the hostess and waiter both said it is fraud too.  They blame Billy the manager and of course groupon.  The waiter was a nasty little guy till it came time for the tip.  The groupon clearly states 2 lunch entree's for $9.99.  Fine print states a value of up to just under $22.  All ok with me.  You can even take a peak at the menu via the groupon link.  The interesting \"fraudy\" part is that the prices reflected on the business website are not the same as on the menu.  Each item is about $2 more on the actual menu.  So it is impossible to actually use the groupon for the purchase price.  You have no choice but to pay more.  Again, the food is great. The groupon/fraud crap makes me not want to ever go back out of principal only.  Billy, fix the price discrepancy or honor the groupon...and teach your staff to not tell me it's \"fraud\" and they agree it is wrong.  The cashier stated that they have tried to call groupon and groupon is in control.  The interesting part is that the prices on the actual Casa Don Juan website are the same as on the groupon link.  This means that groupon has nothing to do with the price increase.  Casa Don Juan is getting greedy and misleading the customer by not honoring the groupon as it is intended.  There is not one item on the \"lunch/dinner\" menu that is $9.99.",

She stood there scolding us saying we ordered strawberry when clearly we did not.

Our server forgot to order someones food and when we asked he said we never ordered it (even though we did and he repeated it back to us). The server then brought the wrong food for another person.   When we spoke to the owner afterwards (again), she was just as rude (if not worse) and then said FINE I'll give you a 10% off coupon. We told her, we don't want a coupon we're just giving you feedback. We're not complaining for a coupon or discount. She raised her voice, started walking away, rolling her eyes and said it was all our fault.

We were served industrial tortilla chips, a watery salsa and a lightweight bean dip.  We each chose huevos rancheros that were accompanied by watery refried beans and the usual tasteless Spanish rice.  Nothing was bad, nor was anything particularly good.  Our bill came up short of our gift certificate's face value so we ordered 2 slices of (mediocre) flan to go.",

Had the server pass us more than a few times wouldn't even make eye contact. Finally get to order my husband orders their shrimp burrito I asked If it came with a good amount of shrimp if not to add extra (we didn't care to pay the extra price) he said that it was a good portion so we took his word. I ordered the cheese enchiladas which didn't taste too bad except the fact that they were cold. I asked for some tortillas on the side for my daughter he brought out the hardest tortillas ever! So hard my daughter choked on it. I guess the only good thing I can say is that our food came out fast. But I don't see how much time they needed to roll a few tortillas and smack them on a plate. (The burrito was literally the only thing on the plate) no sides no nothing. I will for sure never come back or recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for nothing. Besides a 60$ bill for bad everything!",

And being a Frida Kahlo fan, I LOVE eating right by the wall that's full of her greatness!  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants.

There is street parking with meters (quarters) and there is a  parking lot in the back of the restaurant. For First Friday, they set up seating on the sidewalk.  You get chips & salsa (yummy)- guacamole is  extra. I always get the fish tacos here, which are really good, and good sized, too. In fact, I don't think that I've ever veered away from the fish tacos (and I've been coming here for years now). My husband always gets the beef burrito here.  Prices are reasonable. Participates in the Entertainment Book. I would recommend this restaurant.",

The menu is huge and includes everything's you can think of in terms of Mexican food. I really enjoy the flautas, enchiladas, menudo and the Fideo! Food is consistent but not incredible. The margarita's are really tasty though so I would recommend the mango margarita when you stop in.   One of my coolest experiences at this restaurant was when an all women mariachi band played for Mexican Independence Day! These ladies were simple amazing and oh so talented. I happened to be dining there on this day and was lucky enough to get to see them.   If you are looking for reasonably priced dining in the downtown area then this place is worth a try!",

My daughter and I were visiting the surrounding vintage shops when we decided to stop in for some drinks and a quick bite. We walked into a pretty slow restaurant with about 5-6 tables occupied. Based on this, we figured it would be pretty quick service. We stood at the hostess booth for quite a while and although there were about 5 workers standing around us talking to each other, no one bothered to greet or even look at us.  After about 5 minutes, the actual hostess came up and asked \"how many?\" No \"sorry about the wait, hello, how's your day, welcome...nothing. Just \"how many\". Being the type of person that tries to see situations from all points of view, I quickly chalked it up to maybe just an off day..nothing to get upset over, besides, it was 115 outside, I was just happy to be in from the heat and was looking forward to a cold drink and delicious food. We were sat down at a booth and given our menus along with some delicious chips, beans and salsa. After about 10 minutes, we began to wonder when the waiter would come back to deliver some water and take our order. Well he didn't. It was like we were invisible. Keep in mind, at no time while we were there was there more than 6 tables occupied. The waiter assigned to the tables across us continued to service his tables without even looking over to us. I attempted to flag him down a couple of times but it was like he refused to turn our way. Getting a little frustrated at about the 30 minute mark, my daughters and I decided that we'd  leave only if a newly sat customer was serviced before us and unfortunately, that happened. A full half our after we were seated in a booth and abandoned, another customer was seated across us and serviced with water, drinks and order taken.  So we stood up and left. Not one of the 3 employees on our way out said anything to us. They barely even looked at us to be honest. I made a stop at the hostess desk on my way out and said \"you sat us about a half hour ago and we couldn't even get water...a new table was just seated and are enjoying drinks and ordering at this very moment, that's inexcusable. You know what she said as I walked away? \"Have a nice day!\" I have never ever in all my life gone to a restaurant and been blatantly ignored and treated like I didn't matter. There has to literally be thousands of Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas...don't waste your time here like I did.  Casa Don Juan Downtown...get your $#!! together.",

My assistant told them they shouldn't charge that much and she was told by the cashier that she only knows how to charge it by the lunch menu and just told the kitchen not to add rice and beans and she did not know how to charge for just taquitos. I had to go back myself and explain what I was trying to order, finally a manager came up and told the cashier to charge the taquito appetizer because I didn't want a meal.

Perhaps our favorite item is the soup that is an option with every entree. Regardless of location the food is consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and quite helpful. Do yourself a favor and check out this Vegas gem.",

Our experience couldn't have been much worse.  The waiter neglected us to cater to larger parties. We had to ask for a second round of drinks. I had ordered extra salsa and napkins that never came. At the end of the dinner l accidentally spilled my drink all over the table. Not only did they NOT come to the table with a wet rag to wipe it, my husband had to get up and get napkins himself to clean it up. I had to ask for the drink to be replaced.  The Sunset location is so far from this horrible lack of service!!  The staff there is phenomenal. We are treated so well there that to experience what we did tonight is unreal. I cannot recommend this location even though l know this review will make little difference as this city is growing with visitors. All l can say is if you are a local, go to the Sunset location. You won't be disappointed.",

Ordered Margaritas w/ salt which were good & strong so the chips, beans & salsa went well.  Split the Steak Fajitas & Shrimp/Chicken Fajitas w/ corn tortillas which were larger than usual ones that are for street tacos.  It was all delicious!

They gave us complimentary chips, salsa and refried beans dips. Very good and authentic taste. My wife ordered a Super Wet Burrito and ordered the chicken Chimichainsidengas. She enjoyed her food. Mine was good too but I would prefer some kind of salsa or sauce in the of the shell. Our waiter was nice and attentive but we never got his name. Our receipt says Raul.

    "text": "We have been coming to Casa Don Juan for over 10 years and have had some wonderful memories with friends, family over great drinks and food.  This time we decided to bring our 4 kids for the first time. We got seated immediately and served their delicious chips, salsa and bean dip.   Our server was a tall guy named Christian. He did not introduce himself he just quickly took our orders. No big deal, we understand how hectic and busy it can get on a sunday.  The problem started when the waiter got our order incorrect. Once the food came out my son and husbands order was incorrect.The rest of the orders were correct.   My son ordered a double cheese burger but when the order arrived he got a single patty burger. No big deal,  they put another order for another patty.   My husband ordered a chicken taco and chicken enchilada meal. When he got his dish he noticed he had a chicken taco and beef enchilada. He called the waiter back and told him his order was incorrect as he ordered all chicken not beef.   The waiter said, \"isn't that chicken?\" with an attitude and snatched the plate of the table and stormed out of our view all while my 4 kids witnessed his awful attitude.  Again, we kept our cool because of our kids.  About 10-15 minutes later my son's burger patty and husbands food comes out. By this time everyone else was done eating.  By this time my son's burger was cold My husband picked up his chicken taco and it was so wet it opened up from the bottom. Was it from sitting on the dish for a while? We will never know?  Again, my husband called the waiter and told him the food was not acceptable. The waiter coped an attitude and my husband asked to speak to the manager.  The manager Alberto came to our table, he listened to our concerns and apologized about Christian's attitude and mannerisms and waived my son's and husbands plate off the bill.   The server brought out our bill and my husband noticed the bill did not reflect what the manager stated. He called the waiter and explained what the manager had promised. The server snatches the bill crumbles it by my ear and storms away. By this time I feel embarrassed that my kids had to witness this and we walked away from the table. I feel sorry for the server because he is apparently having a bad day and it's  affecting the way he performs.   Yeap that's right I was not upset after leaving I simply explained to my kids that this is not how anyone should be treated and that if you pay for a service you should not settle for less.   Unfortunately, this is not the experience we expected and as a result we won't be returning again.  I hope management understands how good food and good costumer service goes hand in hand.",

The waiter was pretty amazing, super attentive, and we got our drinks and food pretty quickly. In fact, we had a few waiters come by to refill our glasses of water, which is always a bonus for me because I drink a lot of water when I eat.  I ordered #6 with one chicken taco and one beef taco, both with a soft shell instead of hard. Both tacos were delicious and the plate was huge. With the rice and beans, I struggled to finish everything. I also order a margarita that was delicious.  At the end of dinner, the waiters had no problems splitting our checks into 7 checks.  Great food, friendly and awesome wait staff, and the price wasn't too bad for the size. The only thing that was annoying was trying to find parking, but that's just the nature of downtown. I'm glad we came here to eat!",

We googled \"best authentic Mexican food in Vegas\" and this place was one of the top results, so we figured wth, it couldn't be worse than what we've been eating. Boy am I glad we rolled the dice and ventured away from the casinos!  Chips and (tasty) salsa were served before the meal for free... how it should be in every Mexican restaurant. The prices were extremely reasonable. The food was served hot and delicious. The staff was clean and unbelievably attentive. Definitely worth the trip. :D  This would have been a 5 star review, however I docked a star for the picture pressure. (It would have only been half a star, if I could.) Towards the end of the meal, a guy came to our table and offered a picture of us all \"on the house.\" I would have turned it down, but figured if it was free, no harm no fowl. But when he came back with his \"free\" picture, he had two more bigger photos (5x7s) in a paper frame that he offered $20 for one and $25 for both. Being caught off guard by the promise of \"free photographs,\" I felt a little pressured and obligated to buy them at that point. If there's a next time, I will know to turn down the free picture ahead of time. I have a camera on my iPhone that's legitimately \"free.\" Lol.",

I view it as authentic...the building is cool from the outside, and the inside is filled with bright colors. If you go into the main dining room you will see employees making the soft tortillas. Has a nice touch. Today I brought a special friend of mine here for lunch. We were greeted promptly and taken to our table by the bar area. The manager asked if we wanted the chips and guacamole, and informed me it was at market price. I understood and appreciated that information, and also understand how good the guacamole is here. :)  They brought out the chips, guacamole, and other spicy dips. I had to tell my friend not to eat one of the dips until we got our water. After a few minutes, the waiter took our order and we finally got our drinks. I always get the enchiladas with rice and my friend had her entree and wanted both sides beans. They brought out rice, was waiting for the waiter to check on us, but didnt after we recieved our food. To his credit, I think he had too big of a section. After about 10 minutes, I got up from the table and asked for her beans. 5 minutes later they brought them out. The food quality for my dish was excellent. I like the way the rice compliments the red sauce. The shredded beef was cooked well, and the guacamole was better than ever. All in all, my friend liked the place. I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. Gave it 4 for good past experiences. Today they fell a little short. Hopefully those kinks will be worked out before I dine here again. Ps please shorten down the birthday presentation",

Looks like it has been there for a long time, but without looking dingy or worn out at all.   I sat at a table in the bar area by myself. I intended to sit at the bar, but every place has slot machines in LV so it is hard to eat at the actual bar.   The service was friendly, attentive, fast and accurate. And I was the only fool sitting in the bar so the prompt attention was a welcome surprise.   The carnitas burrito I had with red sauce on it was not only legit, but huge. I could barely finish it. Very tasty. Tons of meat. A deal at $12. Would order it again in a second. I barely had enough room to munch on the chips, salsa and warm bean dip they brought. A couple cheap Negra Modelo drafts and it was a great meal at a great price.   I will be back.",

    "text": "When is a good time for Mexican Food, how about everyday! This is a rhetorical question, as you have noti  Viva Margaritas and enchiladas. One margarita, two margaritas with Tequila and it's a fiesta time!   It's updating time, let's take a minute to step back in history. A long time ago, in a far off place called Las Vegas; a boy loved Mexican food so much that his veins probably contained salsa and tequila. A girl whom loved him very much encountered a place where that boy could enjoy his favorite food and drinks all the time. This is pre Yelp for me, but seven months ago I was lost and did not know how to use my strange new electronic tool. Yelp I turned too in the dark days when my beloved boy was taken from me by strange disturbances in the universe. Wanting to be close to him I was only able to eat here twice after his death. Now into the bold new future I find a new frontier ahead and we are rewriting the past with new memories.   Today I am stepping into the future, with empty pages hope lights my path to new discovery's! Pulling the massive doors of the casa we step back into the past it seems. The restaurant is so authentic that Spanish is the first language of most of the fantastic staff. While they speak and can understand most English it does not bother me! The traditional Mexican style food is what I come for, but appreciate the authenticity. We were seated immediately. The feel of this restaurant on the inside is tremendous. The history from the past haunts the walls but the memories that adorn the walls are tokens that we get to see from that living history from so long ago.   As the server came by it was time for drinks, and she straight ahead handed me a drink menu. It's funny that this was the first menu that I was handed too. The server explained to me first off the margarita specials. That sounded great anyways as my mouth was ready to taste that salt around the lip of the glass. Mexican food is best with margaritas, anyways! I wanted the server to bring me the drink and stop explaining all of the drink specials. Just continued to nod; and a while later a drink was placed in front of me. Finally I have that bitter taste of the salt and the fresh shaken concoction that is a top shelf margarita.   Now onto the food: the menu is extensive and they offer daily specials for lunch and dinner. With so much to choose from I needed a minute. The menu is put together extremely well. The choices are marked and clear to read. One can easily figure out what variations are offered for this choice or that one. As I raised my hand and closed the menu, the server came over. I went with the tamales which comes with rice and beans. With so many tamale choice I took the cheese and pork tamale. My twins spilt a plate of cheese enchiladas. Their plate came with rice and beans too.   While enjoying the complimentary chips and salsa my margarita was now less than half full. Our water cups are almost empty too. It's that spicy salsa that makes us want to cool down our taste buds. Our server is truly fantastic she filled our water glasses and our plates were put in front of us at the same time. I must of waved my hand over the margarita properly to send a secret signal that I wanted another to the server. As I was opening the tamale my margarita appeared in front of me. Yeah, that's great service. That cheese tamale was filled with white cheese and jalapenos ooh was it good. It tasted even better with sips of the margarita. The rice and beans here are always delicious. While eating the rice and beans you take your fork and put it in the beans first, then put rice on the fork and enjoy it together as a bean and rice union.   The food here is phenomenal and oh so delicious, as one has noticed I'm sure! The tamales took my taste buds on a roller coaster, especially the cheese one. The pork tamale was so yummy with the tamale so full of pork that with each cut of the fork on that tamale pork was included with the corn mix. Out of the two tamales the cheese was the best. Don't get me started on how ridiculously exceptional the cheese enchiladas were. Taking the fork and cutting into that cheese and red saucy mix, pulling the fork up as the cheese hangs down from the fork. You need to lean in for these cheese enchiladas bites, as to not leave any on your clothes for later. So now why are you still sitting there?  Margaritas check, best cheese enchiladas check, authentic atmosphere check. One cannot go wrong with all the positive things they have to offer here. If you want a wonderful place to have lunch with delicious food look no further. With new pages written for me and mine it's time to close this chapter until the next. Cheers to those that have fallen we raise a margarita in their honor. Cheers to exceptional food and drinks!",

We had the chips and salsa to start as well as Queso Blanca. Note you have to ask for the habanero salsa.....very hot and tasty. They also have a cool bean dip.   They make in-house tortillas and various tamales all day. Very tasty!!!  We had the wet chicken burrito with all the trimmings. Again, nice presentation and tasty.  They have a full bar and all types of Margaritas as well as homemade desserts.   Prices were reasonable and portions were large. Bring your appetite and give this place a try.   We definitely will go back!!!",

She said yes and that people don't really order fries. Umm but it's on your menu? I found it weird and funny at the same time. If you're going to sell fries, price your mediocre fries accordingly. End rant. Can i suggest a price of $1.50-$2.00?  4/30/19 UPDATE: Checked my debit card statement and they overcharged me by $2.00. How can this be when it was carry-out, total came out to $12.xx? Spoke to Juliano (manager), he said he'll get back to me by Thursday. He said the only way this could happen is if they added tip. The plot thickens...   I had a really nice dinner here about a year ago, i'm not sure if I would even come back now.  5/2/19 UPDATE: Still no call from the manager.... If you eat here your card statements. Will be calling my bank soon. Im not mad at the $2 its the principle. It was carry out...  I wasn't waited on or anything, and they have no right to ADD tip themselves.",

Things I liked: - The salsa was pretty good with a nice touch of spiciness. -Fried Tilapia(Mojarra Frita). The fish was very crispy outside which I like but it was slightly overcooked. The meat is not dry but could be moister. The rice and bean were fine. -The service was good. They all work together well, water and chip got refilled promptly. And the servers were friendly and energetic. -It was pretty cool that there were tons of Frida portraits hanged on the wall as decoration.  It was a good lunch and I have no problem to come back again.",

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is unaccommodating and unwelcoming, and the staff treats you like trash if you ask for the simplest things. On top of their already overpriced dishes, charging $1.50 for a small spoonful of sour cream and accusing their customers of LYING when they receive the wrong order leads me to believe that the restaurant honestly doesn't care about their customers, and they are only out to leech money from them.   It would be much more worth your time and experience going to another fine Mexican restaurant in town like Bonito Michoacan on Decatur than to be harassed and provided with the lousy service at Casa Con Juan. It's a shame, really.",

The parking they do have is unlit and in a bad area of town. Definitely thought my car was going to get broken into because I had to park in a dark alley.  * Waitstaff is more than a little pushy. Especially the guy that walks around trying to sell you an overpriced photo he took of your party. Not hospitable at all.  * Portions were generous, but the food was mediocre. Our waiter even said that Lindo Michoacan had better food.  * 3 of the members of my party wanted more sauce to put on their burritos and tamales. The server brought out 3 portions of green sauce, but failed to inform us that sides of sauce were $3 EACH. When I saw an extra $9 added to our bill, I politely asked if they could remove the charge. I was told that wasn't possible so politely asked to talk to a manager. She also told us that it wasn't possible to take the charge off, even though we weren't notified when we ordered.   For putting the business ahead of their customer, Casa Don Juan has lost a customer.",

My gringa wife had a plain chicken breast with refried beans.  I had the chicken in mole.  Both were good.  My mole sauce was very flavorful.  It was rich with diverse elements that made it a complex and very tasty dish.  While there, a nice gentleman played guitar and sang including Speedy Gonzales.  It was a good meal and a fun evening.  I can't wait to go back to try the tongue tacos.",

If you find yourself in DTLV needing a quick bite to eat, Casa Don Juan will totally do it for you. This isn't authentic Mexican food; it's the super-fast Mexican-American style restaurant that can be found across the country. You know what I'm talking about -- the food tastes exactly how you think it will. And this isn't a slam at all -- sometimes I crave that stuff!  One thing to note that you can't find at every other Mexican place: handmade tamales! And they are delicious! Other things we tried were margaritas, queso, tacos, and beans and rice... all were totally fine. The service was super fast and friendly too.   I did think the price was a bit too high for such fast-style Mexican food. Then again, this is Vegas, so I shouldn't have been so surprised.",

I could have done without the bean dip.    I had a wet chicken burrito (I feel pervy just typing that).  The burrito was pretty huge and the green sauce had a very spicy kick.  Well worth the $7.99 price tag.  I had so much chips and salsa that the burrito had to go back to the office with me.   Service was great.  Everyone is very friendly and a couple of different servers checked in on us.  Parking was crazy because apparently everyone downtown eats lunch here at noon.  Thankfully, there is plenty of street parking.  Just bring a couple of quarters in case you have to use a meter.",

The food and drink were absolutely exceptional, making us embarrassed to have been here for many years and not tried it previously.  It was so enjoyable that prior to a Smith Center show this past Sunday, we took friends to share in the experience.  It could not have been more different than the previous visit.  The Patron margaritas were not nearly as good as before (tasted watered down) and two of four food orders were incorrect.  They really have to work on consistency.  As a result, not certain if we will have a return visit.",

Came here with a large party and they could only split the bill in thirds, which would have been fine, had they kept it clean. Instead drinks from one table got put on another table's bill and it was a bit of a mess. Fortunately everything worked out easily. With a cranky office crew, that could have been a mess.

We were almost finished with cheese dip when our server finally arrived. We probably waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us, when he did he seemed rushed, I think he was in a different part of the restaurant. When we ordered drinks he had a tough time understanding the wine I wanted  \"Chardonnay\" so I pointed to menu. I told him we had a groupon upfront incase they wanted to see it first as some places do. I knew the Fajitas #24 were enough for two so I told him we were going to split it. He proceeds to tell us NO you can't do that you have to have two entrees!! (Yes I knew we had to spend $37.50 to use the groupon). Ok we will order another dish. BF ordered Cam Mojo de Ajo, shrimp cooked in garlic. Food arrived quickly. Our drinks are almost gone by now.  My Fajitas had absolutely no flavor what-so-ever, the chicken was very dry. Very disappointed as my girlfriend had them before and they were delish! The #24 shrimp dish was served with shells and legs still on. The garlic seemed like the jarred type, not fresh. Plus normally sauteed shrimp isn't cooked with shells on. It was overpowering with garlic. Drinks empty now. Stick with water. We saw our waiter 3 far and between times. When he gave us check it put it on the table and left. After waiting to pay him, we took it to the front. Would have been nice had he told us!  Not going back.",

I asked the manager if Benjamin was off today and was told that Benjamin was no longer employed at Casa Don Jaun. That is very disappointing, he was the reason my family went to this restaurant. he provided such excellent service. truly an asset to his profession.",

First, they start you off with flavorful salsa, chips, AND refried beans! Love that you can munch and peruse the menu.   My tamale combination with taco and enchilada were delicious and had that rich flavor that is True Mexican food.  My husband loved his crispy carnitas and we both really enjoyed the margaritas!  I have already bookmarked this place for my next Vegas visit.",

I love the tacos, enchiladas, tamales, and chicken fajitas. We always ask for our favorite server Ivan, but the whole staff take great care of us when we are in.

We ordered drinks and food from they late night specials menu, food was good, not amazing but good, it was also closing time so who knows... And around $6-$8 a plate. The beverages were really fun, one came in a bowl and it had like 5 types of alcohol in it and it was delish!   The service was great, drinks were kept full and table cleared off frequently of empty glasses. Friendly staff and comfy booths.   I'd go back for sure! They have a bar in there also that has some tv screens and the restaurant section is a pretty good size.   Cool decor and fun vibe. Decent food. I will have to go back and eat when they are not closing. But I had the Pollo Mole and it was very good.",

    "text": "I had been urged to come here several times by friends, for whom this is their go-to place for a Mexican food fix.  Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.  In this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.    The homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.  I ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.      The taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.    Non-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.  The restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!  Casa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.  This is Old Las Vegas, South of the Border style.  And, based on what I ate and experienced here, I intend to return.",

It was as if they took cheap tomato paste, a pinch of salt, and mixed it with a gallon of water. And it had BEER in it. Still tasted very watered down. I love micheladas but I didn't even get half way through this one. The food was okay but the process of the bill was beyond frustrating. I ordered just a burrito - it was a mix of meat and shrimp and I believe it was $13. I was asked if I would like a side of guacamole with it. I said sure. When my food came out it was covered in a sauce and had MAYBE a teaspoon of guacamole, which was run down and kind of brown LOL. I proceeded to eat half of it anyway, thinking they just threw in something extra. When I get the check, I got charged $18. Why? Because the sauce and \"side\" of guacamole. There is a burrito for that price - a full shrimp burrito, which I did not get, but had I known I was going to be charged that price, I would've ordered that. The least they could have done was tell me that I was going to get a $5 up-charge for the laughable sauce and drop of guacamole lol. Then, when we were getting ready to pay, I noticed my mom added a tip on top of the tip we were already charged for being such a large party. When I told her to remove it the cashier rolled her eyes at me. I will GLADLY stick to Lindo Michoacan.",

The chips/salsa/beans that come to the table free are so good, so was the bloody Mary and the pineapple pina colada.    It has great outdoor seating which we sat at to enjoy the sun, inside the restaurant was pretty cold at the time.  My sister had the chicken fajitas and the portion size was huge, and she loved them.  I had a platter with pork tamales YUM! a beef taco that was ok and a fried pablano pepper stuffed with cheese also very good.  We ate everything and it did help cure the hangover.  Definitely tasted like authentic Mexican you can only get on the West coast.",

We arrived to a vibrant colorful setting and friendly hostess who sat us in the back by the bar area where the noise level wasn't as busy. We had jumbo margaritas and my husband had a Steak Burrito and I enjoyed the Carne Asada dish. Additionally, the Queso Fundido appetizer was fantastic. I have to recognize the gentleman who brought drinks and bussed our table. He was so attentive and friendly, even when it was super busy. However, the server we had did not surpass anticipations. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our Mexican fare and pleasant surroundings of this dining establisment. I recommend coming here for a fun atmosphere and delicious eats if you're in the downtown area.",

And who wants to see a cricket right on your table while you having dinner  the waiter said : oh it's just a cricket then left , aside from that , the food was good and mainly love this place because of all the Frida khalo decorations (I love Frida ) so that was what brought me to this place",

The chips, salsa and beans that come standard as soon as your seated are really good. The salsa is better than any salsa I can think of, and the beans are always hot and fresh and deliver real flavor. The tortillas are always fresh because they are hand made to order. Their breakfast menu is excellent and tamales are delightful!  The service is always good thanks to Jessica and the rest of the friendly staff!",

They stuffed the 4 of us into a tiny booth, which was honestly my only gripe about the experience. It was extremely tight for our group of 4 and we are not big people. So comfort-wise they lost a star. Everything else was great though. I had a couple of cucumber margaritas which were insanely delicious and refreshing. We all loved the chips and salsa (ate WAY too many), and we also ordered the queso, which was a bit thin but tasted great. I had a shredded chicken burrito and loved it. I really wanted dessert, especially after seeing all of the cakes on display when we walked in, but we were all way too full. Next time- less chips, more cake! I'll definitely be back.",

Not to say that my home cooked Mexican is super, but I actually make better.    I had a house Margarita, at nine bucks a bit pricey, as is the food.

I like the location, a little away from the Strip yet still easy to reach.   The staff is very friendly, unless they are busy. Maybe they don't schedule sufficient staff for the busiest times.   So, food is terrific, service is usually timely, and staff is friendly...  I dropped a star because on my last visit we asked to move to one of two vacant booths. The hostess refused to seat us, saying they were reserved. Okay, except it was 10 minutes before anyone was seated in one of those vacant booths; and 20 minutes for the second booth. It made us feel unappreciated as customers.   Aside from that one experience, I've always enjoyed the food and service here.",

Service was great & Food was the same (see below) But they DID NOT HONOR THE GROUPON- all they did was take the price of the groupon OFF OF THE BILL!!!  (they took what we spent for the groupon & not the meals that it was supposed to cover. No discount given at all! ) We bought what we were supposed to, even double checked with the server...then bait and switch at bill time.  No savings here!  I wouldn't say amazing & I wouldn't say great. More like just good. Just good food. Staff was very friendly though. SAFE flavors for just about everyones taste buds. Tastes like it's all from a can or bag...infact, I found a 4 inch piece of plastic wrap in my cheese enchalada!!!!!  Not the best Mexican food in Vegas, but it's not the worst.  When you go into a Mexican resturant and full and it's all middle aged white people - that should tell you what you need to know;  Theres not much seasonings or variety in flavors, just staple 'expected' dishes that should be on a Mexican Resturants Menu.  Traditional combination plates (taco, burrito, enchalada, etc)  with a lot of cheese, not so much interest and tons of sauce to smother it.   The \"jumbo\" margarita isn't.  Resturant is nice, clean and well decorated (except our table rocked a good 2 inches) and the staff was all very friendly.  Some confusion with the waiter though, I kept asking for two combination 31's. and he kept wanting to give me one combination 32....LOL.  There's so much better Mexican food in Vegas but I can see how this would be popular with the lunch work crowd. Those wanting the \"Denny's\" of Mexican food will love it. Those wanting something homemade and authentic will be disapointed. Even Robertos is better in flavor.",

    "text": "Today my mom, sisters, and I wanted to have a girls day. We planned on shopping and getting lunch at Casa Don Juan. I parked in a lot. The spot I picked did not have any signs, but I didn't think much of it because we were planning on eating there. I was gone for no more than 15 mins waiting for my family to arrive and as I walked back I saw that my car was being towed. I walked up the man with my younger sister. We tried to figure out what was happening, he said to release it, it would cost me over $200. I was really upset but I wanted to go inside the restaurant and talk to somebody to clear things up. I walked up to the hostess and I told her how my car was being towed and she quickly and kindly said she would get a manager right away. The manger who was talking on the phone to who I assume was a customer, hangs up and the hostess tried to tell her the situation in Spanish. The manager just shrugged her shoulder at her. I'm pretty sure they didn't know that I spoke Spanish, I tried to explain the situation and she was just being so rude. I asked to go talk to the man and would not hear me out. I even tried to tell her the spot did not have any signs and how I felt that it was unfair. She started yelling and asked me to leave, which I did. When my other sister and mom arrived, we paid the towing fine and they went inside to eat. I was still very upset about the managers respond, but still came in later. One of my sisters told me how they were talking about me in Spanish and pointing fingers as I was walking in. We ordered drinks from Angelica R., who was really friendly, and an appetizer but felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave. As we walked out I asked for the managers name and she mumbled it and said something under her breath. I asked her if she said something and quickly and rudely responded. She told me in front of my sisters and mother and other customers, \"You come in and only have water. Ok, bye! Bye! Bye!\" It was humiliating, disrespectful and  completely uncalled for. I feel that I deserve an apology.",

The manager was being defensive and loud it was awkward and nothing I have experienced before..especially when it was the waiter mistake (which we made no big deal about). I hope that manager is no longer there for everyones sake! This happened a few months ago but it still haunts me!!",

Why 3 stars already?  Because Mexican food is awesome.  And you will get a pretty good version of whatever Mexican dish you order from here.  Not life-changing, but good, Tex-Mex comfort food.    The extra star comes from the restaurant's staff.  I've been there for lunch a few times and in the evening during First Friday events once or twice.  Each time I've been there, the wait staff is friendly and outgoing.  Talking to them generally brightens my day (I work downtown, I need brightening).  Even in the middle of a lunch rush, they are very attentive (last time I was there, they refilled my iced tea so many times that I almost burst).  And if you go at lunch, the owners are often around checking in with tables to make sure everything was good. Hey, family-owned places are becoming rarer in Vegas.  I'm a fan of comfort food done well and great customer service.  Check and check.",

We made reservations and our table was set nicely upon arriving, no waiting is good.   This was my first time here and it was a very good experience. The place is nice and comforting, paintings on the wall, colorful flags across the ceiling, and very clean. When we were walking to our table I noticed that they make their own tortillas in front of you, or at least in sight from where we were sitting.   It was difficult deciding what to order, the food looked and smelt great. So we all order a drink gives and took a little more time to order. I have to point out that their bean dip is delicious! I like to feel out and try different items at a new place I haven't been before, so I went with a combination plate, which included 1 Chili Relleno, 2 Enchiladas, with rice and beans. I also added an El Pastor taco on the side.   Once the food came out, everything looked very nice. I liked everything I had ordered, but the El Pastor taco was very memorable. The meat was very tender and juicy, fresh toppings, and nice in size.   In conclusion, this place was very good! I had tried some of my coworkers food as well and definitely want to come back and order Good portions, great food, constant refills, and excellent service.",

The groupon was for two dinner entrees (for up to $12.99 per meal) and two jumbo margaritas.    We told the server right away and he seemed annoyed.  We ordered margaritas and was told it was only the house lime; no flavors were included as those were extra.  When we got our margaritas, my friend had a black bug in hers.  We flagged down our waiter and he didn't apologize or anything. He just said \"Oh. I can get you another one.\"  Our food came out which was good, but the server never came to see how our dinner was, the bus boy did though who was very nice.  After we finished, the server came over to bring us our check and we have him our groupon.  When he brought it back, the groupon didn't cover all of it and we had only ordered exactly what was on the groupon.  The check indicated that only $45.97 was applied.  We checked the groupon fine print to make sure that there wasn't a maximum dollar value that we missed and there wasn't.  We asked the server why there was still a $12 balance and he couldn't give us an answer.  So we took it up to the front to the cashier and asked nicely to speak with the manager.  She said there was a maximum value on it but we asked where that was indicated.  She said it was in the fine print, but when we showed her the fine print, it was not there and she could not find it.  She didn't want to help us and felt annoyed that we were asking about it. Finally after her reading the fine print for another few minutes said \"oh well it should be in there\".  She didn't apologize at all and finally changed our bill to the correct amount where we just owed tax and tip.  She blamed it on groupon saying that the price in things have changed and that groupon didn't reflect that.  The food was just okay but the customer service was absolutely awful!",

I was craving fruity, so I order the large Mango Margarita & my friend ordered a large Strawberry. I like the fact that they use real fruit in there margaritas. They where large and not weak, perfect! We ordered the nachos. They where served on a very large platter drowned in real cheese w/ beans and shredded chicken. YUM!!!!

I was expecting a queso fundifo-type deal, but it was literally partially-melted cheese with some crumbled chorizo and sliced (stewed) jalapenos on top. Quite disappointing, really. Their margaritas are good, and not too sweet.  I got the two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans the first time we went. Their tortillas, both corn and flour, are handmade.  Let me repeat that. Their tortillas are handmade. If that's not reason enough to eat there, then I don't know what is.",

I've went a couple times around 2pm and loved it.  If you're looking for mariachis, then bring an iPod.  If you want Roberto's style quick food, then go to Robertos.  This place has decently priced beers and food.  I'm a fan of kicking back a couple Modelo's with some chips, salsa, and cocktail de camarones.  But then again, if you're in a lunch rush, I don't think two or three beers is what you should be after.  Overall, good place to grab a bite/brew with some friends, although for a date, the Bar + Arts Bistro is probably better to head to.",

    "text": "I've been going to Casa Don Juan for years, but hadn't visited in more than 6+ months. It looks like the plating and service has changed quite a bit. This time around I went in with a groupon (2 Dinner entrees and 2 Jumbo Cadillac Margaritas for a $46 value) and a group of 3 people.  We tried ordering a Thursday special of Sopes without the margaritas they come with and we were told they couldn't charge us for the food without the drinks. Having tasted the jumbo cadillac margaritas we had received from the initial groupon we turned down the offer of getting additional margaritas. Why you might ask? They tasted less than mediocre and whoever made them was horrible at mixing! It also shows the lack of flexibility and management experience when the manager doesn't know how much to charge for food if its not printed on a 'special' pamphlet as well. We didn't mind paying a difference, and ended up ordering one Sope as a separate dish which truly wasn't a sope but a tortilla with chorizo on it.    I give Casa Don Juan 3 stars for seating us promptly and being attended quickly by the servers with chips, bean dip and drinks. The restaurant was clean and it had musicians playing authentic Mexican Corridos with guitars. Definitely set the mood. The cheese dip was great and so was the handmade corn tortillas! But the food is fair, there's no sopa de fideo and we couldn't get over the horrible alcoholic beverages. Some of the staff doesn't understand English, glad we're Mexican and can speak spanish! Parking is also bit tricky and difficult to find-  unless you want to park at a meter-  because it was packed! Not the best yet not the worst experience. Our final bill was $65, we only paid about $30 with tip due to the groupon. For that amount you could go to another Mexican restaurant in a nicer area/location. Maybe in 6+months the food and service will change again. Till then, happy eating!",

While we were in Vegas this past weekend, we all wanted Mexican food and were going to go to Carlos and Charlie's at the Flamingo but thought it probably wouldn't be the best place for authentic Mexican. We were just about to pull out of valet parking at the Flamingo when one of the valet girls offered to give us a few suggestions for alternative Mexican places. She suggested Casa Don Juan or Ciscos (Sisqos? sp?). We went with CDJ. My cheese enchilada had zero flavor, and the rice was basically the same. The enchiladas were ridiculously spicy, but spicy doesn't matter if there is no flavor behind it. My grandma got the chili relleno (which she gets at all Mex restos) and she didn't like the looks of it. It was soaked in grease and so much cheese you couldn't see if there was even a chili in there. She took one bite, waited a few minutes, and then felt sick. Not good. My grandpa got the bacon wrapped shrimp  and said it was alright but had no flavor, either.  Chips and salsa were not memorable at all. Staff was friendly, but that didn't make up for the bland/overly greasy food.  Cheese enchiladas 2/10 Rice 2/10 Chips and salsa 3/10",

    "text": "I went on a Sunday night after seeing a performance at The awesome Smith Center. Six of us, all long time locals, and frequent foodies! (We try everywhere!) Three of us ordered items that come with tortillas (2 Fajitas and 1 Mole). The portions are very generous but tasted only OK. However, that wasn't really a big deal. We were enjoying the atmosphere, service and the company of friends & family. The problem occurred when the bill came and there was a random charge of $3.50 for tortillas. Hmmm. Where did that come from? I inquired? Apparently, after a rude explanation from an unfriendly woman employee, we were advised that it was because we ordered extras tortillas to go with our food. So, let's recount...I ordered fajitas. I have been ordering and eating fajitas for a long time. I always make 4. The other order of fajitas needed 4, and the one who ordered Mole ever even got hers. We explained this, but to no avail. Their ratio is that you get 2 flour tortillas or 3 corn tortillas with each order. Really? Really? And, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUCH AN AFFRONT IF IT WAS JUST STATED ON THE MENU OR STATED BY ANY OF THE 4-5 EMPLOYEES WAITING ON US. No one ever mentioned an extra charge, but we are supposed to, either know this by osmosis, or, know that the \"tortilla lady works very hard\" (according to the unpleasant female who spoke with us) and as if we have no respect for the tortilla making art! Ha! We left feeling very unhappy and felt that they chose to alienate us from ever returning due to what should be an easy communication with customers. Seemed like a scam, looked like a scam, definitely was a scam.",

I will admit that I'm a picky eater and this restaurant is always willing to modify it's dishes to fit my needs. The staff is great and for the prices these dishes go for, the value can't be beat.  Appetizers like the Salsa, Pico De Gallo, and Beans are always there right after you sit down and ordering is an easy process because the servers are always very knowledgeable about the food on the menu.   There's also a guitar player who plays tunes for the customers and happily takes requests from the audience.  Every time I go there though I want to tune his guitar cause it's waaaaaaaay out of tune haha... maybe it's supposed to be that way I'm not sure.  Kidding aside, it's always nice to hear a song or two while we eat.  Service and food are both exemplary here and definitely recommend Casa Don Juan to everyone.  Two words: Chile Rellenos...

    "text": "Following our round of drinks at Velveteen Rabbit, the wife and I walked a few doors down for some Mexican food at Casa Don Juan. I'm far from an expert on the finer points of authentic Mexican cuisine, so I went in with an open mind and an empty stomach.  Casa Don Juan had all of the familiar earmarks of a family-run operation.  The dining room was cozy, clean, and colorful, albeit a bit gaudy replete with Mexican tchotkes and neon cerveza signs.  Service was fast and familiar as the complimentary chips and sauce were delivered promptly to our table.  We added an order of guacamole for our chips.  The guac was smooth and fresh, good, but fairly standard fare.  It may have been a bit more enjoyable if it had been made fresh tableside.  No worries, though, because my order of Menudo (available only on Sat. & Sun) was exactly what the doctor ordered.  The generous amount of tender beef tripe was swimming in a delicious chile infused broth.  The dish was fortified with hominy and accompanied by a plate of chopped cilantro, lime, onions, black pepper, and oregano add-ins.  It was hearty and flavorful and a big winner in my mind.  While there likely are whole list of Mexican restaurants that the locals know of that are superior to Casa Don Juan, the wife and I found it to be satisfying and a solid value.",

If Casa Don Juan was a bar without a food menu, I would give it 5 stars right now for the amazing pina coladas served inside a whole pineapple. I wonder how many cases of pineapples they must go through in a week. The flavor from having fresh pieces of pineapple blended inside the creamy, frozen beverage is just perfect. They also make fresh lemonade that is very good, along with other flavors of aguas frescas.  The food warrants a much lower rating. I enjoyed the chips and salsa, but nothing else tasted fresh. The cheese tamal was bland and dry, tasting like it had been frozen. The chile relleno was also strange, like a wet towel filled with a cheez-like mass.  I should have just ordered a burrito so as not to challenge the cooks too much. I hope they don't freeze those, too.  Until Don Juan decides to put the same level of effort into his food options as he does his beverage menu, I'm content to sit in the front waiting area, sipping my fresh pina coladas between the collection of sombreros and the wall dedicated to Frida Kahlo. Just bring me some chips and salsa if I'm getting a little tipsy.",

My husband and I ordered the Super Wet Burrito, the combination plate with Chile relleno, enchilada,  and taco, plus a side of guacamole for our chips.  I also got a large margarita.   Everything was delicious, fresh, and had good flavor.  The restaurant was packed!  We were seated within 5 minutes, all the staff was super friendly, and the drinks and food were delivered promptly.   I would highly recommend and plan on making this a regular stop whenever we visit Vegas.",

You might think to yourself, hmmmm - lavender margaritas - seriously? And the answer is yes, SERIOUSLY -- you must try it. Try to imagine a warm blanket and a hot cup if tea on a cold winters day, mixed with a little afternoon delight -- and you'll find this margarita which is a mix of comfort and sass -- as well as a delicious explosion in your mouth that l leaves you wanting more. We also tried lime, watermelon, and mango -- all very delicious but you definitely want to begin and end the night with lavender. The food is almost equally amazing -- every fracking bite was delicious and the service was above par. Even my friend who is a super picky eater loved everything that she tasted. If you are in Vegas -- come to this off the strip little slice of heaven -- you won't regret it -- unless you don't try the lavender margarita.",

Wait time for a booth was less than 5minutes. The only reason why I am not giving my usual 5 stars, is that we had to ask for beverages, which took way too long, and we than had to ask for a waiter, as no one welcomed us as we had been seated for at least 10minutes. I'm sure they were busy, very understandable on a Saturday afternoon. Menu is way too long! Too many things to choose from!  But what we did order was very tasty and delicious. So, it was worth the wait.  Would I go back? Oh yes, for sure! It was a fabulous lunch with great conversation and food.",

We had not gone back in about 8-10 years because, frankly, they had a guitar player strumming Mexican music and singing so loud that we couldn't chat with each other during our meal. Last night there was no guitar player, but our experience was not pleasant and we were very uncomfortable and will not be returning. When we entered the hostess was pleasant enough, but our waiter could not have been more disinterested in us. In fact, I almost felt as if he somehow had contempt or disdain for us. He would look off and away from us when he came over, barely spoke, got my order wrong and never asked if we wanted another drink, nor dessert. My tamale was very dry and my husband's carne asada was so-so. We are seniors and we have lived here for 20 years. But, the atmosphere has changed. It's not the friendly, cheerful place it once was.  I noticed also that the menu was now printed in Spanish with English dishes printed in smaller letters below. I looked around and there were 5 tables of guests in the room, all of whom were English speaking.  All I can say is I had a very uneasy feeling in that restaurant and I won't go back.",

First, if popularity is any indicator, this is a great restaurant.  It was packed on Sunday afternoon at 3 PM -- and that's in downtown.  The vibe is typical Mexican.  The waiters' costumes are pretty and authentic.  The service is friendly and efficient -- the waiters hustle.  The margaritas are great.   The guacamole is very good.  However, having such a good feeling about the place overall, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with my food.  The chile relleno was not very flavorful.  The taco was OK at best.  Overall I'd say \"typical smashed bean and rich\" Mexican food -- not worse but not better than the average -- in a much better than average environment.  The menu is huge so hopefully the other dishes impress.  Overall, I like the place and would come back.  (But skip the chile relleno.)",

It worked and we will never go back!    Honest opinion of food....below average however it is a nice atmosphere.   Don't buy a Groupon, they don't honor them. They give a lame excuse about how it is a misprint. They did reluctantly honor ours, up to $10.99 apparently means anything over $10.99. Explain that logic! Groupon states 2 lunch items up to $10.99 for $13. They said what I really means is spend over $10.99 for each item and we will honor the groipon......thus making it a $9 coupon. If you spend over $22.....   Rude rude rude",

It's very festive in decor with Frida Kahlo pictures adorning the walls.  I started off by ordering a lemonade.  I thought it was going to be lemonade from a fountain dispenser but it was freshly squeezed! It was a foamy lemon/lime concoction. It was delicious but no free refills so I settled on one. I also saw people drinking out of a pineapple. It looked refreshing but I didn't know what it was.   I had the beef flautas which to me is like a rolled taco. It came with rice and beans. I forgot to tell them to hold the beans. It was good but my brother ordered the carne asada torta which tasted better. I told him he can have some of my flautas if he gave me some of his torta. The bread looked home made because the top looked bubbly. It isn't flat like the ones you would get at Robertos. My husband must have loved the Carne asada burrito because he was finished so fast!  It is a busy place so don't expect your food to come out right away. It was also noisy because there were lots of groups just having a fun time! It's a nice place to gather with friends and family.",

I shared a Saturday afternoon lunch with my dad and grandmother and we all were impressed with the quality, flavor and portion sizes we received!  The wait staff was happy to bring my dad a bowl of their hottest sauce, as he didn't think the regular salsa that came with the chips and beans was hot enough.  My carnitas was tender and juicy, served with guacamole and lime alongside of some of the best spanish rice I've had.  My dad proclaimed the chorizo in his huevos con chorizo to be very flavorful - he said it wasn't spicy at all, but he can't be believed in that.  The tortillas that accompanied our entrees were obviously very fresh and hand-made.  The service was friendly, but could have been a tad more attentive.  Lunch for three with coffee and tea, plus a dessert to-go was $41.  All in all, no complaints - and I'll definately be bringing friends and family back to Casa Don Juan.",

Sometimes the crazy people are in my group yakking on and on about riding sheep, sometimes they're in the form of a large, older woman showing us the tattoo on her breast.  And in case you were wondering, yes it involved a rose.  Because of this and this alone, this very mediocre place gets an extra star.  I loves me some crazies!  The food is OK.  It's not scary or anything, and when you've got a Friday night, beer fueled hunger on it can be damn fine.  It's better than Macayo's even though the waitresses share uniforms, I think.  The service is pretty universally crappy.  Maybe it's because I'm there on what has to be their busiest night of the month, but seriously, one should not have to wait 20 minutes for a check.    I would like to kiss the man who brought a fellow diner a side of sour cream on a plate.  A few minutes later, he reached for what he thought was his napkin and got a surprise.  It gave me a different crazy to look at to distract me from that lady's boob.",

Being from Hawaii, we don't get a lot of authentic Mexican food - so we were happy to give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews. Prices were good - compared to Hawaii - and the plate sizes were giant.  I wish restaurants would make smaller plates and smaller prices!  Guac was very yummy! Only reason this doesn't rate higher is due to the servers.  We were asked if we wanted Guac with a chips and we said yes.  However, it didn't show up and we had to ASK for it!  Then the drinks never got refilled and water never came.   We are used to crappy service in Hawaii but this was pretty bad. I'd come here again, but I'd split a plate with someone and not expect the service to be spot on.",

You can tell every employee works together and is busting their ass, without making you feel as if you're being rushed so they can flip a table. I've never seen so many employees smiling. It's as if they enjoyed what they were doing.  What a concept! I'll definitely attribute it to the Mexican culture that prides hardwork while enjoying life attitude. Inspiration for us all. Among the many highlights were our beautiful server Angelica, the incredibly delicious handmade corn and flour tortillas, and the intoxicating salsa.  This is everything you hope for in a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Would love to give more details, but uhh I got a life to live ;-). Will definitely be back soon. Next Saturday sounds good.

    "text": "This review has been a long time coming. Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say \"I'm an undercover Mexican!\" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try.",

It's conveniently located to the First Friday festivities... and you can guarantee yourself a healthy portion of food.  The grilled fish Ranchero style was perfectly cooked. Guacamole was good with just the right amount of onions. The margaritas were a little weak though so expect to drink a few before you get a buzz.  If you come on a First Friday, expect a crazy crowd and expect that your server may be in the weeds and therefore... not so attentive. Come any other night of the month and service should be just fine.  I like this place because the crowd... and the hot summer night I just walked out of and into this restaurant.... somehow reminds me of a night at Chuy's in Austin, TX.",

LOL..  some of my favorite moments have happened in this restaurant to meeting a online friend for the first time to me and the fiance getting our moms together for the first time.  The food never disappoints and the drinks are to die for.. Guacamole hands down is the best in town.  TY Casa Don Juan for the many memories and great food.. hope for many years to come..",

    "text": "I was feeling like eating Mexican food on the way back from my long trail run at Lake Las Vegas to Summerlin, and since I was going to pass all those Mexican neighborhods, I called my Mexican friend to recommend me a good Mexican place in that part of town.  As usual, she replies \"none\", you have to make them from home, but she did mention a few places and since Don Juan was pretty closed off of 515 that I was on, I decided to come here.    It was reassuring when half of the parking lot was filled with Nissans.  Mexican folks seem to love Nissans.  The interior was strangely filled with Frida Kahlo stuff.  I was somewhat uncomfortable being surrounded by unibrow paintings but I got used to it.    Chips with salsa/bean dip, tostadas with ceviche, carne asada burrito plate.    The burrito was FULL of carne asada, unlike stuff you get at typical chain places where you find a few pieces of meat among a LOT of rice and beans.  It was the opposite and VERY filling.  Ceviche was good, but I'm more used to central American type of ceviche where there are big chunks of fish, but all of the fish ceviches I've had at Mexican places seem to have small, flaky sort of fish, but it was good in a different way.    Depsite my running 8+ miles and having an enormous appetite, I did not have space left for tamales that were ordered so I had to take them home.    All in all, I liked the food and I would definitely go back there.",

    "text": "Guacamole is yummy!!!! :D  I LOVE coming here to eat breakfast on the weekends. It's the perfect place to eat if you have a hangover too (Menudo), quiet, and no wait if you go between 9am-11am.... So my favorite meal to eat is JUEVOS RANCHEROS $9.. Now I must warn you, they give a very big proportion of food no matter which plate you get. I recommend either one of these plates: the NOPALES, JUEVOS RANCHEROS, CHILAQUILLES, AND you have to try A SIDE OF GUACAMOLE. Their guacamole is made a little differently than most places, no tomatoe, but diced onions and cilantro- YUM!! Aside from the good food, the staff is super friendly, helpful, and always on top of things like filling up your drink, getting you napkins or picking up your plate. You're most likely going to spend about $8-$16 per plate, a little pricey, but well worth it I think :)",

Our food wasn't great at all it tasted like you something you buy at the market reheatable meals. Our waiter probably visited our table maybe twice in the two hours that we were there.  We should've just stopped at McDonald's it would've been way much better.  I wish I could give it zero stars but unfortunately Yelp doesn't allow me to.",

The tamale and chicken chimichanga were great but the steak chimichanga was by far the BEST! They don't skimp on the meat and the Flavor of it was out of this world. Our waiter Jesus was also friendly and checked on us often! He made our food recommendations and we couldn't be happier! Will definitely be coming back on our next Vegas trip!",

Mexican is never my first choice when it comes to dining options.   For starters, we got the cheese dip to go with their salsa and bean dip. This is the highlight of the whole meal. I would have been happy to order a few bowls of this and a side of guacamole as my entree. Instead, I got sampler plate. It consisted of a tamale, enchilada, and a taco. I did the pork in red sauce, chicken enchilada, and beef taco. The meat was dry on all three. At this point, I was full anyways.  The margaritas are good. A little more on the sweet side than I would like, but a squeeze of the lime wheel helps. They come in two sizes, regular and the large. You might as well do the fish bowl, because life is better with more alcohol.",

    "text": "\"Yelp fail!!\" - Everyone at my table  Unfortunately, my family's experience at Casa Don Juan was not the greatest.  While the free chips, salsa and bean dip were great (it's kind hard to screw that up), the food we paid for was not very good.  I ordered an a la carte Al Pastor Taco and the Pork and Red Sauce Tamale.  The taco was, truly, the worst taco I've ever had. EVER.  My mother, who also ordered the same taco, spat it out and pushed the plate away.  The flavor and texture of the meat was all off.  Rubbery would be a good adjective -- Tacos El Gordo, this is not.    My tamale was dry, dry, dry and the advertised \"red sauce\" was barely noticeable.  There was really no flavor to the pork and, overall, was a really bland dish.  Definitely would not order this again.   I'm probably going to give the Casa a second chance.  I enjoyed the ambiance and the service was friendly. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things.",

You also get beans and salsa with chips. Beans are worst than canned beans. Absolutely no flavor. The salsa is too spicy for my palate, so I can't really judge.  The chicken quesadilla was just ok. Nothing to really write home about.  Overall, this place wasn't good enough to return to. Roberto's is way better and cheaper.",

The salsa was addicting hot and the bean dip was pretty good too. We ordered our drinks and my frozen margarita tasted more like water, sent it back. My friend sitting across me literally waited for about 20 minutes for her beer and we had to remind them. The whole time we were confused as to who our server / busser was, there was like 4 different people servicing our table.    The pina colada looked pretty cool as it is served literally in a pineapple. I ordered the pescado frito 'fried fish' and it was good.   Overall, service was crap, food was your normal for a Mexican restaurant but it's a little bit over priced. The ambiance was fun and we were there to get drunk and have a good time, and we definitely did.",

First of it was Monday morning, most of us hungover (really hungover) It was a group of 12 with out resevations, and they had no problem seating us in a few mins. i thank them for that.

Pepper is taken off the check which is so nice... the additional $9 margarita is now on the menu instead  what the heck you guys? Not that it should matter but we're white. And you guys seriously have lost some great appreciative customers that didn't mind over tipping when it was worth it  all that matters is good service and awesome food. No race. Prejudice or anything else. This really sucks man.",

    "text": "We came with a Groupon.  The place was packed, which tells you something considering it was downtown in the arts district, there was road construction in front, and parking can be a bit of a challenge in that area.  We had a 20 minute wait in a comfortable seating area on a Saturday night, without a reservation.     Pros and Cons: Service was friendly, efficient and excellent without being overly intrusive.  Food came fast and was hot and good.  The margaritas were strong and delicious, however they did not offer a frozen margarita, which is our preference.  The large menu is in both Spanish and English and does offer some vegetarian options including a vegetarian burrito but I'm not certain  whether they use animal lard in the dishes without meat so if you are vegetarian you may want to inquire.  I didn't see anything to address gluten-free concerns.  The atmosphere is family dining but there wasn't entertainment, so while it's festive and pleasant, I'm not sure this is a destination for special occasions such as birthdays.  They offer little bags of chips and treats for purchase on the way out, which is a nice touch.  We will definitely be back.",

This isn't a \"meh,\" and it's not an \"A-OK\" it's more of a, \"Eh, ok.\" This place was packed last Friday night with a lot of families and older folks holding out for a table. We opted to sit at the bar and avoid waiting for thirty minutes to eat. The bar area was pretty dirty, both the back bar and the front bar had old plates and previous diner's old cocktail glasses on them along with a half eaten bag of Cheetos, I'm assuming they were the bartender's snack.   My wife and I decided to share a combo plate, two tacos, a Chile Relleno and Tamale. This wasn't the prettiest plate of food, but it did what it was supposed to do, fill us up. The tamale was pretty dry, too much masa and not enough Verde chicken inside. The filling inside was decent, but was hard to find. The Chile Relleno was a cheese bomb, the cheese was all I could taste, they used a very sharp cheddar and it blew any chile flavor out the window. I tried the taco, and after one bite it fell apart. The meat was flavored nicely, but the shell was something that reminded me of taco day in High School.   The food and service are ok, and if this is your last resort for eats on Main Street, it will do the trick, but don't seek this place out.",

However the inside could use remodeling. Too much clutter, random decorations, the gaming machines look tacky. The boyfriend ordered the chicken and mole. The traditional way of serving mole is using a chicken legs with the bone still intact, gives it more flavor. They serve it with chicken breast. The chicken was rubbery and did not taste fresh. I ordered a simple carne asada burrito with beans and pico. I asked for the rice on the side and when they brought the food, there was rice in the burrito and on the side. Idk why, i just don't like rice in my burrito, but they quickly fixed it. The burrito was allllrrriiiigghhhttt. You get complementary chips salsa and refried beans. We ordered guacamole which was weak. No pico mix in the guca, we all know that's the way to serve it, I would had rather ate it straight out the shell if I knew that's how it would be served. My bf is a chef on the strip, so he knows what's fresh and what's not and the guca tasted like something out of a pre packaged bag. When we asked the server if the guca was fresh he hesitated and said \"it should be\". Which already told us, it wasn't.  We won't be coming here again. Food is not traditional. Anyone who thinks this is \"traditional\" is a gringo, and you're better off getting food from the taco truck.",

Jessica was working hard as usual and is still provides the best service! She really should be their top waitress! Our waiter was \"Jaime\" and our service was great! Food was delicious....updated my photos so you can see and decide if they have something for you. I would definitely recommend if you are wanting authentic Mexican food....it's has indoor and outdoor seating (but it's starting to get hot outside)....it does get busy but we like to go early to avoid the crowd.   The food here is good but customer service sucks! They mostly have grumpy male waiters, they try to be nice but if you ask for something out of the norm, they clearly aren't happy.  They have a really super nice and excellent busgirl (Jessica H) and she is what represents good, friendly customer service.  She really should be more than a busgirl!! They do no substitutions and this is what is ridiculous....if you want to substitute rice for beans, they will charge you for a side of beans...even though it's a substitute! They had cleaning solutions by the food. We generally make an effort to come here when we travel to Vegas because the food is good....but with the crappy service, we will find another good Mexican food restaurant with at least decent customer service. Or maybe just come back because of Jessica :-) I don't really think a place like this cares what I have to say, but I think it's important to let others know. If you give it a try, ask for Jessica and you are guaranteed great service!",

Maybe there's no other good tamale places here I guess...lol",

Complimentary chips and salsa are provided and the upsell of the guacamole has seemed to stop after more than a few complaints.   Enchiladas, tacos, nachos and burritos are my typical go-to here with the shredded beef burrito being my favorite.   After a evening of running around downtown and the 18b you don't have to run for the border but you do have to get to get to California & Main St.   Free limited parking is located behind the restaurant on California or available street parking after 6pm.",

Although this is Mexican American food, it's just as good as anything you'll find in Corpus Christi or Chula Vista.   Lots of seafood possibilities here, too. If you're a low-carb, veggie/vegan, let them know. There are sneaky ingredients at work here, but they'll listen and alter recipes to taste/preference.   It has formal dining, and lots of Las Vegas locals, rather than the tourist business, although it's located in the very touristy Arts District (currently being repaved, but lots of free parking). This is my fourth time here, and it's been good each time. Recommended for small groups. A little kitschy here and there, but lots of fun and good food. I cannot vouch for the drinks.",

The restaurant itself doesn't have much customer parking in the back.  The adjacent buildings have more spaces available for patrons.    We were able to get a booth right away.  Soon after complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip are brought to the table.  The bean dip was very bland as though they opened a can of refried beans without mixing any cheese or spices to make it a 'dip'.    For my entree I chose the #23 Carne Asada Plate.  This comes with the Meat, Small cheese enchilada and rice & beans.  I wasn't wowed by any means.  It was all just average for me.    If friends want to come here I wouldn't mind. I would hope to find another dish that that would peak my interest.",

When we walked in, we were ignored by the woman at the counter immediately to the right when you walk in. The host station is the one straight ahead, which we figured out after this lady couldn't be bothered to look at us.  The waiters were very nice, efficient, and attentive. Food came out quickly but nothing was very good. I usually blow through two baskets of chips at Mexican restaurants, but at this place I ate just a few chips before deciding they were not even worth the calories. Bland chips, bland salsa, bland refried beans. Three of us ordered watermelon jalapeno margaritas, we all swore that they had no alcohol in them. My cheese enchilada was OK, but my tamale was just bland, dry, and lukewarm. My husband ordered a fish taco and a shrimp taco, he took one bite of the fish and stated it tasted awful and left it uneaten.  We will not be returning to this restaurant.",

We've never had trouble parking at the small lot behind the restaurant, but then we are early eaters. The neighborhood is much improved.  Service is always excellent and the ambience is very nice. It's not so loud that you can't have a pleasant conversation.  The only criticism I would have is the margaritas were a bit too sweet on our last visit.",

So I just got ranch the salad was actually a solid 10!  I had a side of flour tortillas also really good!  My nephew had a enchilada (green) and he likes it!  The customer service was definitely attending!  The flan was okay I've had better!  The Horchata wasn't exciting my taste buds either.  The salsa was really good along with the Mexican rice! I would return here!  I love the inside decor also !",

After we ordered drinks it took them about another 10-15 minutes to come by and acknowledge us. They finally got to the table and asked us what we would like to eat. I ordered a beef chimichanga, which was delicious. However my girlfriend ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas and upon receiving the food, it was cold. It also didn't have enough seasoning in it. This wouldn't be the first place on my list to recommend downtown.",

The relleno was top notch and the taco was great (asada if it matters). The tamale wasn't bad but nothing special. If not for the poor service, would have been a five star review. We had guac show up ten minutes before we had chips at the table and it took probably 15 minutes to get margaritas. In all fairness, the place was busy as hell but it's my understanding it's always like that here.",

We dropped several hints to our waiter that we were celebrating a birthday but he didn't acknowledge. When we received our food, the ceviche had a horrible stench. The cheese tamales weren't even fully melted on the inside and with very little flavor. The women's restroom stalls didn't have any locks or purse hooks. First experience and LAST experience.

The \"bad\": the food was ok at best, arrived quickly, mainly tasteless...the portions (other then the rice and beans) are fairly small yet the price is not cheap at the least, paid $11 for a 5 inch long enchilada with rice and beans. the chips were ok, light and crisp, the salsa was hmmm uninspiring at best, the bean dip...about the same. all in all...there is nothing exiting or inspiring, nothing that make you go WOW, now that is good (insert anything here). Will I be back? not a chance. there is nothing to come back for,",

Probably will not go back again. The raised their prices since we were there a year ago about $4 a plate, and the portions are small. Only about 2 table spoons of beans, give me a break they are the cheapest thing to make, and theirs were watered down.  They also don't do happy hour on Fridays anymore.",

Waiter came over every few minutes to ask if I was ready to order- with menu open. The food came in about 4 mins after I ordered. Just an assembly line I guess. Margaritas were mostly the pre-mixed sweet and sour. Man took away chips and plate before we were done. The push to turn over the table was keenly felt. The tamale was tender, chips store bought, table salsa ok. Beans were good, but it all needed a lot of heat. Did not feel like a $30 dinner.",

    "text": "Went in for lunch today. I had waited a while (years) to try this place because there are a handful of awesome Mexican restaurants in Vegas that I frequent regularly. After a numbers of years of thinking about trying this place, I wish I was still just thinking about it. There are much better Mexican eateries in Vegas!!    My experience today included a super long wait from the time I was seated until the waiter (really sweaty guy) took my order. We're talking 20 solid minutes before I ordered. One redeeming thing at this point, the chips and salsa - the salsa flavor was good and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.  Ok, food comes. Very greasy beef taco, very, very greasy. That's just gross. Pork tamale - not bad but could have used more meat in the middle. Cheese enchilada was okay. There was something, like a noodle, in my beans. I noticed it about half way through. I don't know about you, but it's hard to keep eating after you find something weird in your food. Rice was just average. Sweaty waiter pretty much ignored me until the very end of my meal. I asked for a refresh on my completely empty water glass - it took a while but another man did eventully bring me a fresh water. Then the bill comes and I'm now in a rush to return to work, so I didn't look at the itemized check. I think I was over charged by at least a buck or two. Being in a rush I just blew it off. First and last time I go here. Period!  Conclusion, go to a better Mex spot! There are excellent places around town. Sadly, this is not one of them.",

    "text": "Casa Don Juan gets 3 stars because the description is spot on, \"A-OK.\" I like going here, it's like my mom's most favorite Mexican restaurant ever. However, if I had a choice I would go to Lindo Michoacan.  The last time we went was for my boyfriends birthday. My mom ordered a whole fried fish covered in garlic. The thing could have easily fed 4 people. It smelled wonderful. However, I have a problem eating anything that stares back at me. I opted for two shredded beef enchiladas.  They were very flavorful and came with very large portions of rice and beans covered in cheese. My bf had a combo plate and he also seemed to enjoy it as well.  The portions are huge and very filling. That is usually the problem for me at Casa Don Juan. Now I am not complaining about being served a goodly amount of food for some pretty reasonable prices, but for some reason, every time I go, and no matter the amount of food I eat, it sinks like a stone later. And its not like I over eat each time. I seriously go into a food coma afterwards, and it feels like my stomach is filled with lead.  As for the margaritas and pina coladas, hmm, they were not sweet. I've had better ones at Outback . . .  I do have to add that they have excellent service. The server asked if it was a special occasion. We told him yes. They were going to bring us some free ice cream but we told them we were Very full. Instead he brought a plate of whipped cream which he dabbed on my bf's nose and the servers sang a birthday song to him. They also have one of those photo ops, where they take a picture of your group and give you a free postcard then later try and sell you a photo (totally optional and there was no pressure).",

The guys swore by it, saying they had been there each year during this particular trade show and it was terrific.  Everything about the restaurant was pretty unappetizing... The condiments on the table consisted of chips, a watery substance that I think was supposed to be salsa, and a grey paste that I think was supposed to be bean dip. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, thinking that would be safe enough, however it tasted pretty bad and I only ate about 4 bites of it.  However, 4 bites turned out to be enough to cause the worst food poisoning I've ever had, which kicked up around midnight that night and lasted until noon the next day.  I spoke to the other person in our party who had ordered the same thing as me, and sure enough, she had gotten sick too.  Needless to say, I will not be going to this restaurant ever again. Ever.",

It serves a wide assortment of basic Mexican food at very moderate prices in its large, comfortable dinning room.  A friend of my wife and me, who has been a customer for many years, took both us of there for dinner.  We started with guacamole and tortilla chips that was fresh, well prepared, and creamy.  For our entrees my wife had the Carnitas de Puerco (pork, guacamole, rice, beans and pico de gallo), and I had the Puerco en Chile Verde (pork, green chile sauce, rice, and beans).  Flour and corn tortillas accompanied our meals.  Our dishes were very well prepared with quality ingredients, nicely seasoned, flavorful, and fresh.  The meat was tender and delectable.  The beans and rice were very good accompaniments, and the tortillas were hot off the griddle.  The service was extremely attentive and unhurried.  Casa Don Juan is highly recommended for its delicious food, excellent service, very reasonable prices, and enjoyable atmosphere.",

My last visit was horrible. I ordered the wet burrito, and was told it came with pico de gallo and guacamole. I asked to substitute chopped tomato and onion for the pico de gallo and sliced avocado for the guacamole. The waiter seemed hesitant with my substitution request, but took my order anyway. My order came with the sliced avocado, but not the tomato or onion. I talked to my waiter, and he went to get it corrected. He returned, and said that he made a mistake, the pico de gallo was not included in the burrito, so the change could not be made. I asked him to please have my order prepared the way I requested it, and to make it to go. In the meantime, my napkin fell to the floor, someone picked it up, but did not bring me a new napkin. I voiced my concern to the manager, and the best she could do was to give me 20% off.  I felt that was the final insult and have no plans to return to the restaurant. Their food is excellent. The chefs are always consistent with the quality of the meals.  If I do go back there, my order will be to go.",

The service was much better this time, and our food was actually served hot. I got the chicken fajitas. They were literally sizzling hot. The portion was quite generous. The fajitas were flavorful. I might actually go back, even if I don't have a Groupon.",

TWELVE FLIPPING DOLLARS for a VIRGIN Pina Colada and another $3.50 for a Shirley Temple for our two young sons!!! Most places include a soda with entrees off the children's menu and they charge three - and - a - half bucks for a Sprite and a couple of cherries?? The waiter couldn't seem to understand my confusion when he explained that Casa Don Juan charges the full price for non-alcoholic drinks. How 'bout offering up that little nugget of info to a customer upon ordering, huh?!? The drink menu on the table conveniently doesn't list prices and the \"jumbo Margarita\" I ordered seemed to be a virgin drink as well. Needless to say, I felt taken advantage of tonight and, consequently, will no longer offer them my business. Adios, Senor Juan!",

The hostesses wore beautiful traditional Mexican dresses.  We were immediately greeted and shown to our seats.  The musician/karaoke man in the corner was a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so.  He went out of his way to entertain our kids with some personal attention, a song while wearing a funny mask.  (They LOVED it!).  As a matter of fact, the entire staff were completely friendly and helpful.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure our experience was pleasant and enjoyable.  The prices were very reasonable too.  There's not much you can do with Mexican food, let's be honest.  But it was very good, as Mexican food goes.  The EXPERIENCE and customer service we were given earns Casa Don Juan 4 and a half stars in my book.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I think these may have been some of the best carnitas I've ever tasted, and I just got back from Old Town in San Diego. These were way better! Great staff - Cruz was our waiter and did an awesome job. The whole staff is on it, making sure you are having a great time. When we were there, at my request, a great young mariachi band with a terrific female lead sang 'Bessa Memucho,'  to us. What could be better?! Enjoy the experience!",

Not only was his customer service skills less than we are accustom to, he tried to charge us $10 for bringing in our own birthday cake!!  There were 7 of us celebrating a birthday and were not advised of the charge until AFTER we had finished eating!  We had the cake sitting on the table, sang and served it with no mention of any add'l charge until it was time to pay the bill.  Needless to say we asked for a manager who was VERY apologetic but the damage was already done.  I might add that 3 of us speak Spanish so communication barrier was not the problem.

They have a large menu with many good choices.  I highly recommend the chilaquiles with green sauce, and a Pina colada for a cocktail. I promise you will not be unhappy with those two choices.   My only complaint at times is the staff. The majority of the time you will receive great customer service and friendly staff.  BUT at times you may receive a staff member that can be inattentive and rude.   Overall I would recommend this establishment very highly.",

And again disappointing. Service was definitely lacking. Waiter didn't fully know the lunch specials, before they had a paper that came with the menus showing lunch specials but not any more. Food was satisfactory at best and from what I was told of my group. As for mine, I decided to step away from my regular enchiladas and try the shrimp burrito that was I believe $14. That definitely was nothing special especially in presentation. A burrito on a plain plate, no sour cream, no lettuce. Roberto's and Fausto's in the area have a shrimp burrito for half the price that kills this.   Something here has changed from what it's been in the past.",

    "text": "Normally, I love Casa Don Juan. The pollo endiablo (spelling definitely wrong there) is delish, and homemade tortillas? To die for. Did I mention the make fried ice cream with Fruity Pebbles? SO GOOD! I've been here twice before and had a wonderful experience each time with great service - today was almost bad enough to make me not want to return.  The waiter was exceptionally bad. First, my friend tried to order a side of soup; apparently the sides of soup aren't sold on Sundays, okay, that's weird but whatever, she adjusted. Her salad came a good 15 minutes before my chicken, so she was nearly finished by the time I barely started. We went to order our favorite, the fried ice cream. We were kept waiting for about 10 minutes after ordering and then the waiter came back to tell us that there was no fried ice cream today because the ice cream was too soft. Um, you can't stick that in the freezer? His reply was chilling (even if the ice cream wasn't) : \"The freezers aren't strong enough to freeze ice cream.\"   WHAT?  While I was screaming to get out of there and questioning where my meat was kept, if not in this subpar freezer, my friend asked him to recommend an alternate dessert. His response: \"I don't really like the food here. I like Puerto Rican food better so I don't really eat here. The sopapillas look kinda good.\"  We ended up giving up on getting anything sweet from there and just flat out left. The waiter didn't charge us for my friend's salad, which was appreciated considering 2/3 of our orders were rejected, but my advice to that waiter - if you don't like the food at the restaurant, at least have one or two recommendations that you can somewhat stomach! Sometimes honesty isn't the best policy.  Still deciding if we'll be back... that fried ice cream is pretty magical. But I think I want proof the freezer works, first.",

They have a small parking lot in the back which is awesome as finding parking in the area can be a problem in itself. Like most Mexcian spots, Don Juan gets props for complimentary chips and salsa but they made it even better with a side of bean dip yum!  Located right on Main Street near Charleston, Don Juan is located near the Downtown Arts District and gets packed during First Friday, They restaurant itself tries to capture that old-town Mexican feel with it's brightly colored walls, titled floors and hanging florals. The night we came in there was a mariachi band in the next room playing for diners - a nice touch.   The menu is huge, easy to get lost in, and has pretty much every incarnation of Mexican food you could want. There specialty seems to be tamales but they have a pretty wide range of seafood offerings as well. I thought it was a little over priced, two chicken tacos with rice and beans were like $13. My  smothered carne asada burritto was ok, it looked like a giant enchiliada but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The carne asada was very dry and the fillings could have used a bit more spice. The re-fried beans were mediocre but the Spanish style rice was pretty good. I just didn't feel like it was worth the $15 I spent, there are alot of great culinary finds in the downtown area and I feels like Casa Don Juan could do more.",

As I walked into the restaurant, I was surprised by how rude the staff was. There was no greeting or assistance. The food (#13 and a fish ceviche tostada) tasted bland. The icing on the cake was when my fiance felt something crawling on his arm. He looked down and saw that a roach had crawled from his arm onto the window. He quietly notified staff to tend to the matter. A server came out with a fly swatter to kill it, but left it lying somewhere in the booth behind us. We both woke up this morning sick from food poisoning. Avoid this dirty restaurant.",

I have Celiac Disease, so if I eat anything with gluten I'll get very sick. At first when we saw where it was we were a little hesitant, it's not the best part of town, but I was with my father so I was okay with walking around the area. Boy, I'm glad I took a step outside my comfort box because I really love this hidden gem! We were greeted by a very friendly man. When I asked about gluten free options he said I could have the fajitas with corn tortillas. I LOVE how this place is decorated! It's very unique and authentic. They have a nice patio, so I bet when the weather is nice it's lovely to sit out there. The food was absolutely delicious! The chicken was very tender and juicy. For the price we paid we got TONS of food! The best part, I didn't get sick. Gluten free safe for me! Next time we are in town we definitely want to come back to Casa Don Juan!",
