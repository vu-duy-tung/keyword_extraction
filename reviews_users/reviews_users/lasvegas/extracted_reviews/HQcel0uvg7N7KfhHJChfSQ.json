The slices of superwhite were extremely thin, and had none of the butteryness. The only thing I semi enjoyed was the sashime included with Ayce..Just take the jalapenos of and replace with Daikon. That spice too overwhelming with glob of Siracha.",

Usually its only me and my wife and we get seated almost right away almost every time (if you don't mind the bar seats and sitting next to other people). During dinner on the weekdays, and anytime during the weekends and holidays, expect to wait at least 30 minutes, and parking can be challenging. Other than that, food is awesome, service is great !",

I've been here before 3 PM to catch the $19.95 AYCE price and at 1AM for $24.95 price, still a good deal and busy.  Parking is limited but there is plenty of parking in the lot next door and walking is safe.   The restaurant is not too big, but they are on top of cleaning tables as soon as one is done to get the next group seated, or you can take an available seat at the bar.  The staff is hustling in there, I have always had good service.  There is a karaoke bar next door that you can have a drink while waiting for your table, just let them know and they will go get you when your table is ready.  They have a good variety of rolls on the menu, my fav so far Tiger Roll, Bonzai roll Rainbow roll, sexy roll and Vegas roll.  They also have good size nigiri pieces. I've read that the kimchi fried rice is yum and it looks yum, but Im always too busy with the rolls to try it.' I do like the bacon scallop skewer and baked green mussels.  We always start with the Ahi Poki, yum!!  Last call to order is 2AM.    Oh yeah, they have Pepsi products, yeah.  Love this place.",

The only one we didn't care for featured bbq eel. We also had some nigeri the jalepeno poppers and a seaweed salad. All of those were ok. The spicy here was indeed pretty spicy which I love but it might be something to consider if you are sensitive. My gripe with this place was the hostess. When I called she said they didn't take reservations until 10 and that we wouldn't need one because it wasn't busy. Lo and behold it was busy when we got there and had to wait a half hour to sit at table that was empty when we got there. The mixed drinks were good tasting but lacked a kick. I'd be inclined to give this place 3.5 stars and another chance if I was inthe area.",

Like the fish just doesn't look cold as if it's been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes probably because you see your wen you buzz them to the table three times. The cuts are really weird especially the salmon. The portions are tiny, meaning you have to keep calling your server over. If you End up eating here best thing is to order a lot at once because you won't see your server again until long after you finished whatever round you were eating.   Not to mention the parking in this building sucks the most poorly designed parking space (it's a giant square that's impossible to back out of). This restaurant is always on a long wait especially on weekend nights and when you sit down the awful music is playing so loudly you can't hear anything. Seriously last time I went \"Let it Go\" was shrieking over the speakers. I just don't want to hear that during dinner with friends.   There's much better All You can Eat options that are open late and for the same price point.",

The service was absolutely terrible and slow, all three of us were charged for all you can eat sushi when we did not want all you can eat. The fish was not fresh and it was warm, we had to repeat our orders for dessert because it never came as well as ask for refills on our drinks. When leaving the establishment we walked out of the back because that is where I was parked. There was a cook smoking, trash and grease all over the floor to the point I had to remove my shoes before I got into my car. The bathroom was filthy and smelled like sewage. There was also grease all over the men's bathroom floor. I am unhappy and honestly will never go back to this place for sushi. Everything  about  my experience  was terrible and I would NOT recommend it to anyone I know.",

I came in for dinner the first time and this time I came in during their slow hours which was between 3pm and 5pm.  ATMOSPHERE: Good, relaxing and I was extremely grateful for the A/C which wasn't on blast making me cold like most restaurants nor was it too hot. Hey, that's important! Just saying =) the interior has the typical classic Japanese sushi setting and very subtle wood and black colors with interesting pieces of Kabuki masks and Japanese paintings.  FOOD: good good good! I enjoyed all of the nigiri that I ordered which was what my entire AYCE sushi experience consisted of. I don't really like getting complicated rolls and I prefer to taste each ingredient in its beautiful simplicity. White tuna nigiri is my favorite and although it hasn't been the best I've ever had, it was still pretty good. Other nigiri I recommend is Cajun albacore, salmon, amaebi (sweet shrimp), surf clam, eel and yellowtail. Stay away from the tuna and tako wasabi, respectively they were dry and too slimy.  SERVICE: great service, I wish I remembered our Asian male server's name. He was way better than the rude Spanish guy that we had during dinner my first visit. Also the girl with the Skrillex haircut was pretty cool/nice. Definitely much better service. Keep it up and I'll be back =)",

According to them some of the items that were on AYCE menu are no longer and or have shrunk in size.   The service is in dire need of improvement! So slow! Inexcusably slow and waiters or waitresses don't pay attention or do it on purpose! I see why there is a 90 minute usually there is 60 min limit they run you out of patience by forgetting about another order.   One of my fave things to order is Ikura... The  lack of salmon roe is very noticeable. They cover enough for you not to see its all rice.   One thing I did enjoy a lot was baked muscle but that was the only highlight.",

If you are fussy about the quality of your sashimi, I'd go with Sushi Koma, Goyemon or Blue Fin.  THE MEAT: Their lunch and dinner prices are $2-5 bucks less than most AYCE joints and their menu is more extensive - including skewered items, noodle dishes such as Japchae and bottomless ice cream.  We enjoyed the bacon and scallop skewers, the dynamite and ahi poke with seaweed.  The nigiri not so much - the salmon was not as fresh, the ono was slightly seared and served with rice doused with vinegar (same with the Cajun albacore... it was a little weird to me, very sour).  For the rolls we had the Sex Bomb, the Dragon Roll and Amigo Roll.  All were pretty good except for the fact that the sushi rice on the rolls was all warm.  I'm not sure if I'm just accustomed to cool temperatures, but what I'm reading is that sushi rice should always be cooled down and served at room temperature, or as the same temperature as the fish it is served with (cool if raw and warmer if cooked).  All in all, we still enjoyed our meal but next time I'm craving good AYCE nigiri I'd rather pass out at Sushi Koma.   I'M STILL DIGESTING... That awful warm sushi rice.  And the fact that the tables around us were getting their orders a lot faster than we were.  Curse you cursed table with slow food turnaround time!  (I dunno what happened, service was pretty good).  WANT TO SEE SOME FOOD PORN? :-) Amiga and Dragon Roll <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-kaya-las-vegas-2?select=mhRBiy1FrsIzos1YYD_2Ug#1vzoZpqBSLQo5IYDWwyW1w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a> Tobiko and Cajun Albacore Nigiri <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-kaya-las-vegas-2?select=mhRBiy1FrsIzos1YYD_2Ug#unN0x_B2-Tzx3-jkMpTDEw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a> Ahi Poke with Seaweed <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-kaya-las-vegas-2?select=mhRBiy1FrsIzos1YYD_2Ug#hmdH0Iq8smKdZeSLQ_IBnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>",

While eating it the seaweed was chewy a few bites and that quickly turned me off. Then I ordered the lasagna roll because I thought that was a clever idea, it was so bad I had to stop after trying it and then scrapping off the cheese on top that looked like clumps of butter and trying again.  Then they brought me out 2 other rolls that I forget the names and they were ok nothing special.  The last two days after eating my stomach has been upset.  I will not go back. Staff was nice and that's about all that was enjoyable.",

The decor is simple with a modern Asian influence,  along with a high energy vibe and music playing in the background that makes this place hip. It's Located in the heart of China town, it's worth getting off the strip to enjoy the all you can eat and made to order sushi. Be aware the dinner prices are $27 per person, but well worth it. The sushi was a little better then middle to high grade and the service is excellent. We were helped by 3 different servers in which they all seemed energetic and attentive,  Also they will charge you extra for any leftovers you don't consume, so eat what you order.. That's understandable right? Lucky it's delicious so we didn't have the problem of leftovers. Because of its good Location, convenience, great staff, good sushi, a good vibe, easy parking and fair pricing I gotta give this joint a 5 star! Bam!",

If they were able to charge you for the toilet paper you would use in their restroom they would. The Sushi, yes, its ok. I guess. We were a party of 6, 4 adults, 2 children. According to their policy parties of six or more get charged a gratuity fee.That includes children. Mind you, all they are gonna eat is probably some soup and peas. So that means, if its you and your partner, and take your 4 kids, yup! you guessed it. 18% gratuity added. POS place. Honestly this is why I have going to eat at Asian places. Mofos want to charge you for the straw your sipping your drink with! Customer service is something they could get a lesson in!",

    "text": "I had a terrible experience on the evening of 4-8-17 around 8 pm. My party and myself were waiting for our checks to get picked up after eating. About 15 minutes went by, which we thought was odd so we walked to the hostess to hand them our checks. After standing for five minutes we discover their card reader is down. This explains why they never picked up our checks at the table. The hostess tells us \"We're working on it.\" in a very unpleasant tone. Another 10 minutes go by and my party and I are becoming impatient. I then tell the hostess in an assertive fashion that I need a resolution to this problem, and I want to talk to the manager. At that point we had been standing for the aforementioned time period plus the time waiting at the table. The hostess snaps at me,\"You don't have to be rude.\" I then tell her,\"And you don't have to be a b****.\" Afterwards a young, Mexican, female busser decides to jump in to defend her friend and begins arguing and lecturing me (she had a bad attitude the whole night prior to this scowling at all the patrons in the restaurant and moping about). I tell her to walk away and mind her own business but she continues on. Finally the busser ceases her baboon like antics and walks away as the manager arrives. He barely speaks English and virtually ignores my explanation for why his employees should not argue with paying customers and finally hands me a piece of receipt paper with my card number scratched into it. They did not offer me any compensation, they did not apologize, they did nothing! What kind of establishment runs this way. The customer is always right you morons. Also, they told me they would call before they ran my card but did not and ran it anyways. Great job. I'm never bringing my business back here again and I hope you teach your employees with piss poor attitude to shut up and not argue with customers. This is singlehandedly the worst experience I have EVER had any wear, at any business, in my life. #theworst #dontshowupatmyhospital",

However, I have never had any problems with their service. The staff's attentiveness and quick service remain positive.   This place has an extensive sushi roll selection compared to other sushi joints. The big plus for me is that they offer half rolls for almost all their sushi rolls. I like this option to give you an opportunity to try many of their items without getting too full on one sushi roll. They have a decent selection of skewers and nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is a hit or miss for me.   Kaya only takes reservations for large parties. Be prepared to wait during peak hours. Don't forget to ask for their sushi stamp card where your 10th stamp gets you a FREE dinner, but you're unable to use it on the same day it was stamped.",

There was a time when I didn't like something i order and i was able to return it and not be charged (mind you I only took two small bites).

This time we placed our first order for AYCE. Our order was incomplete. We tried asking numerous servers about our order. We had to wait 40 mins before our the rest of our order was brought out. Also, they no longer offer refills on their soft drinks. I ordered a lemonade and it was watery. They only offered a refill once after our check was brought out. I spoke to the manager and he said he would discount our drinks. That was $5.00 Felt like a slap in the face. The worst part was no where was an apology offered. Nothing. I mentioned to him that after waiting for so long we were ready to walk out. He said charging us full price was fair. I don't mind paying my bill but I didn't feel like we got the service or food we paid for. Also, the sushi was a bit cold and lacked flavor. The super white tuna cake out dry and bland. I paid my check and left but I won't be going back. I'll take my business elsewhere and will be letting friends know this isn't a place I recommend.",

I was surprised the rolls with mango tasted as good as they did. I love the fact that they do 1/2 size & full size rolls. Service was friendly.   It was a busy night, so the wait was about 20 minutes & they were definitely sticking to their rules. I saw them abiding to the 90 minute time frame to be able to turn tables around due to the business demand. Also, the table next to me was complaining because they were charged for 4 rolls ala carte price due to not finishing them but the rules are clearly stated on the menu for all customers to see.   One of my rolls was incorrect. They made the roll with cream cheese & it wasn't supposed to have any. Also, there was a bit of a wait for refills & whatnot but I understand they were busy. Overall I had a great experience & I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Sushi Kaya is my favorite place to go for sushi. The quality of their food is very high for the price. Sushi Kaya offers all you can eat at lunch for $20 and dinner for $25. They also give you a stamp card that gives you a free all you can eat every 10 stamps.  Their sushi rolls are the best thing about Kaya. They have a large variety for everyone's taste palette.  I highly recommend the Sex Bomb Roll, Cinderella Roll, and the Volcano Roll.   The nigiri is tasty too but not the best I've had in Vegas.    What I also love about Kaya is they offer everything for all you eat including pot stickers, skewers (the bacon wrapped scallops are great), soup, edamame, and more!  The atmosphere is great! Very nice decor and the seating allows for privacy. The service is very fast and friendly too- however, on a busy day, it's a little difficult to get they're attention.",

It is definitely one of my favorite sushi spots because: 1) It is open late (until 3am), 2) the baked green mussels, and 3) I LOVE AYCE SUSHI! (AYCE Dinner is $24.99!... HELLA GOOD!)  As of lately, whenever I get that sushi craving, I always end up here. I don't know if it's in my comfort zone, or if the UNIVERSE gave me some form of GRAVITATIONAL PULL to Sushi Kaya, but I'm all in!  Since I first started coming, there has been an increase in customers. There is always a waiting list for seating, and they even opened up a smaller room for customers! To avoid the line, I suggest sitting at the bar. We got in there in 5 minutes! =)  Some of my favorite things that they offer are: (I mean I love the entire menu, but I do have my favorites. Don't we all?) -Green Baked Mussels: My all time favorite! They, hands down, have the all-time best baked mussels in my book! -Japanese Lasagna roll: Okay. Guilty. I just love baked sushi rolls! & Japanese Lasagna never fails me anywhere! -Japanese Pizza: This is also baked, hehe! This isn't a roll, more like a Japanese pizza on a tortilla. Delicious! -Salmon Skin Salad: You must try this! The salmon skin is fried and crunchy, in salad, and drizzled in this zesty dressing. -Sexy Roll: Loved this! It had a little crunch to it, plus I love rolls drizzled in sauces. Lol. -Super White Tuna Nigiri: Gotta have it at all times!  Okay, I can seriously go on and on and talk about every single thing on the menu, but these are some of MY FAVES!  As for the service, It was good. Our server was Super Nice! I'm sad I didn't get her name though, because I believe she has been my server twice already.  If you haven't already, have a go at some GOOD SUSHI, try something new, and ENJOY!",

True, the waiters are hard to get a hold of sometimes and you have to search them out, which is why I order everyTHANG at the start.

    "text": "I love Sushi Kaya! They have always been a favorite of mine. There are not to many places I feel safe ordering eel. This is a place I know I'll be happy with whatever I order.    Their customer service tonight was a little more off than usual. Could have had something to do with how busy they were. They are always pretty busy so I don't know why tonight one of our servers was a mess. We were waiting for him to go over the sake menu with us and when he came up, he asked us if we were ready to order drinks and we said \"no, could you please\" and he grabbed the sake menu, placed it in front o us and then walked away. Another server saw and heard how offended we were and sat down and helped us with our drink order.   The other server was back and hovered over the server taking our drink order. Once the server that took our drink order walked away, our original server looked ready to run away again, but since I've been here before I was ready to order for the my party of three. We started with:  edamame calamari tempura pot stickers seaweed salad shirmp/scallop  black dragon vegas roll rainbow roll shrimp lover roll cinderella roll arizona roll whos your daddy   I ordered all the food at once and it all came out at once. All of our order was out in about 15 minutes. There wasn't one thing that our table wasn't happy with. Everything was fresh. Nice, flavorful pieces of eel on black dragon roll. They were out of the white Tuna so we ordered squid, octopus, tuna, and red snapper nigiri which was a taste that just tastes clean and fresh.    At one point the absent minded server took our drinks to refill and never returned with our drinks. We asked another server for drinks and we still never got them.   We had green tea ice cream and mochi to finish. It was delicious as usual.   This was a great visit because we got our food so fast. The customer service could use some work.   3 ACE 2 Sodas 1 Hot Sake $105 with 15% tip  Now that I think about it they are more of a 3.75 because of their poor customer service for such a high price. Reasonable if server had paid more attention instead of getting paid by my table.",

I eat here often, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because on occasion the staff has made me wait incredibly long periods for my orders, and usually there is a long hour + wait outside, however it goes to show how delicious this restaurant is, and usually worth it if you can stand the wait. On the bright side they offer stamp cards.",

I also already have my sushi spots and until something goes wrong, I have no plans on straying.   The nigiri and hand rolls were good and I liked the Tiger Roll (Shrimp tempura, cucumber with spicy tuna, avocado, and eel sauce) and Dancing Eel Roll (Shrimp tempura, cucumber with spicy tuna, unagi, and eel sauce). I also enjoyed the Ahi Poke (white onions and seaweed salad) and shrimp and vegetable tempuras. Otherwise, nothing special or memorable.   I'm a little surprised how much everyone likes this place. It wasn't terrible, but I was not impressed in any way. I think the lines between AYCE sushi restaurants start to blur a little because offerings are the same or very similar, so after trying a few restaurants, something needs to stand out. Perhaps if I had tried Kaya first, I may have liked them better.",

I've learned that it's best to sit at the bar so they can't ignore you!... To those reading this: It's great for a late night AYCE sushi but don't expect service from the staff!

The price is decent for an AYCE sushi for $19.99, but the quality of fish is horrible. For people who are into nigiri sushi, this is not the place to be, the fish is cut super thin and accompanied by a lot of rice.  The rolls are decent, and the other non-sushi items are pretty good.  The one thing that I really didn't like about this place was the service.  The servers would get our first order and then once you received your order it was hard to order again.  There were times where we order nigiri and we would wait ten minutes, ask about it and then they would finally start making it.  If you want a place for cheap AYCE sushi at night this is one place, but I would rather pay a lil bit more for better service and quality.",

It's a shame to consider this place for dinner, or even for a glass of beer. Their fish is not fresh and the entire restaurant is so dirty. The only reason why people go to this place is because the location is in Chinatown and because it is open until past 3am. If you are craving sushi, or any kind of japanese dish, wait until the next day and eat elsewhere. I am a local and this is by far the worst place ever with the worst customer service. I have never experienced a place like this before, i created a yelp account just for this. They should be so ashamed of who and where they work for.",

    "text": "3.5 stars for meee.  Lunch $19.95 Dinner$21.95/$22.95 i forgot.  I was a little skeptical going here, we've always wanted to try their AYCE but we weren't sure if it was going to live up to our expectations hah. here goes my long review.  I had dinner here last night with the bf around 7 and it was packed. I really liked the atmosphere, tables were full and there was a party in the karaoke room so it was a little loud, and not so good singing haha kind of added to the fun atmosphere.  Overall i liked the dining experience Korean/Japanese, nice deco, fun atmosphere(they were playing K-pop the whole time) loved it! , friendly waitresses/chefs, fast service, cheap AYCE (2 hours!!), and good but not great food.   I was starving when we got there so i ordered alot of side-orders for the first round, we got: Skewers:] i was a big fan of these really tasty! you could only order one of each per person so we tried all of them except for the gizzards, the only one that i didnt like were the beef tongue but i've never tried it before so my opinion probably doesn't count for that.  Pan fried Udon: Really good, it had a korean feel to it, i think they had a kimchee mix in there but it wasnt too overwhelming, the only problem with this is when we left my udon plate was still there. Their size for this order is huge for AYCE, it was like a regular order and i think this got me kinda full fast.  Shrimp tempura: we got two orders of this and it was hot when it came out yummy and i was a fan of their tempura sauce kinda sweet-issh. AHI poke: Def get this if you like Ahi poke, very flavorful and fresh tuna. Baked Mussles: has a teriyaki sauce. ordered this couple of times.f I think we ordered more but these Appetizers really made my $22 worth it already without the sushi. Other appetizers are Kimchee fried rice, shrimp fried rice, bulgogi, fresh oysters, beef bowl, korean noodles, etc.   For the sushi.. I was a little disappointed, if this review was based on their wide selection of Appetizers i would have given them 5 stars. but for the sushi and nigiri for me they kind of fell short. We ordered salmon, tuna, yellow tail, cajun albacore, ama ebi, scallop.   - it was okay, some the salmon was kind of fresh but the others kind of tasted weird to me and the cajun albacore was drowned with like this vinegar taste.  For the rolls we ordered the OMG roll and the Spider roll, maybe we should of tried other ones but after forcing ourselves to finish the OMG roll.. oh my gah i guess we now know why its called that. The OMG roll was california roll with chunks of tuna on top of it with bigger chunks of tomatoes covered in their version of the dynamite sauce.. dont get it!! the way they arranged the roll wasnt how we expected it and we were unaware that they had tomatoes in it...yuck.. The spider roll was pretty good, i dont think this roll could ever be bad.  for dessert you could only get one ice cream:[ bummer! choices are vanilla, strawberry, and green tea.   All in all this place has good AYCE side dishes, really great selection, okay sushi, and great service. Just a side note if you're going to eat there dont wear a white blouse with shorts! that was what i was wearing and if i walked around the place people would have asked me for orderss.. i would go back here again to try their regular menu though.",

    "text": "First time reviewing, don't know if it is possible to give less than 1 star. However, it was definitely not my first time there today, their food has been consistently tasting worse every time I've went. The food is never cooked as well as it was the previous time, and the service gets worse and worse. I can understand neglect when they're not busy, but the rate that we received refills does not match up to how busy their servers were.   Also, an interesting situation which could have been easily resolved came up when I ate there today: my friend (who eats there a lot) brought multiple stamp cards, which more than qualified for a free meal. As a business man myself, I understand the value of being cheap for the sake of saving money for the business; however, something worth many more times the value of a $19.95 write off as a meal is keeping good customer relationships. By refusing to honor the fact that she did deserve a free meal, they lost 3 frequent customers who frequently brings other new customers to this establishment. Yes, their cards say no combining allowed; yes, my friend did forget her card several times; but also yes, they made a promise to honor a combination of stamp cards the last time she was there. Sometimes business people do have to take a step back and evaluate the whole situation instead of being a little bit stingy. Sometimes business people need to not make such a big deal out of a small transaction.   My friend ended up leaving without paying so I payed for her meal, and they took my money without batting an eye. I wish that one day we can live in a society where business owners can focus on people first and money second. Such a small transaction could have easily gone either way but they decided they needed $19.95 so desperately that they were willing to refuse long time customers.   Done deal. I paid unnecessarily so now I'm venting on Yelp. Thanks for taking the time to read this, anyone who does.",

    "text": "I went here after a long day of work and I was super hungry. I was greeted by a girl and she was all smiles and that was good. I quickly got my drink and started ordering. The all you can eat price was $22.95. So I thought it was reasonable. I ordered mostly appetizers since that look more interesting then the sushi selection. I have to admit most of their food is spicy or really spicy. Which was a turn off since after one bite mouth was numb and I couldn't taste anything else after that.   After my first round of food was gobbled up I was still very hungry and I needed more food right away. The server asked me if she could do anything for me and I replied yes I would like to order more food. She smiled and went off to another table. So I was sitting there for 30 minutes I know coz I was timing this. And after the same girl came and asked me if I wanted some thing else?  At this point I was beyond angry and I started telling her off. Then she had the nerve to tell me that \" well I'm here now so what would you like?\". Right then and there I asked for the check!  Then she asked me if I was already full?  And I thought to my self , r u kidding me!!  The service at this restaurant is a embarrassment especially in this economy. All she had to do was apologize and be sincere about it and instead she had to give me lip. Well I spoke to the manager and she said she was sorry about I didn't get the feeling that she sincere about. I got the feeling that this happens all the time and this was a routine situation for then. The manager ask if i wanted the money back?  And because I felt like nobody was sincere I said \" yes please\". As if giving my money will make me forget about it. Or even keep me from speaking about it. Well they got another thing coming. This kind of situation should never happen and the servers there needs to be trained properly.",

    "text": "Can't speak for others, but I would give this establishment a 'No Star' rating if I could. We are rather undemanding customers and we like to enjoy our dinners at a restaurant at our own pace and we do not expect servers to run around for us frivolously and our tips are at least 20% if not more.  We do not like to pick on any restaurant if it is simply OK. But this one is unbearable and I simply cannot hold back my opinion as someone who works butt off for our customers to make our living. The music was loud, and it was some sort of Korean pop music with rather fast beat. Sushi is a very Zen food which is supposed to be enjoyed in a rather serene environment, isn't it? The service is absolutely horrible: it was not the busiest time of the night as there were several empty tables; many servers were running around but nobody came to hand us a menu nor asked us for drink orders. I wanted to leave, but my diabetic husband started showing signs of low blood sugar and going to another sushi restaurant was just beyond him at that moment. So, with a number of failed attempts to get a server, finally one of them decided to stop by and took our drink order, right after he left, another server decided to hop by and asked us again for our drink order. We sat at the Sushi Bar, and there was a Sushi chef standing right in front of us, but instead of starting to take our orders, he completely ignored us. We waved at him several times, he finally reluctantly came over and said' you have to give your orders to your server and we make it for you.\" WTF??????You've got this bureaucracy going when most, if not all, other sushi chefs take care of the customers sitting in front of them directly along with servers assisting with their drinks. The drinks finally came, and the server was ready to walk away without asking us what we'd want for our food. That was strange, so I asked him if he should be the one who would take our sushi orders, he told us that the sushi chef would take our order directly since we were sitting at the sushi bar. Ooooookkkkkk. Seems like either the sushi chef who had spoken to us or this server had no clue if were not lying to us. Then the chef and the server conversed between themselves in front of us, in Korean, the server then took our orders and walked away. We told him that we were doing AYCE. We were expecting the orders should come gradually, but man o man, the servers dropped all our orders in front of us at the same time---at the sushi bar!! It was very embarrassing that we had all these plates spread out to the spaces next to us, thank Lord, no one was sitting next to us at the sushi bar. The yakitori was tiny but OK, the sushi rice was too soft and sticky as if they had put too much water in the rice when they were cooking it, which is no more than just being edible. We ordered two orders of Uni sushi, one for each, the uni was OK. And here came to insult--the chef told us that we were allowed to only have one order per person---wasn't it on the freaking menu? And we never wanted to order another round because 1) uni is a delicacy, not a staple 2) it is an expensive ingredient, for AYCE, as fellow business owners, we certainly understand the matter of numbers and don't want the restaurant to lose money!! The chef had to go out of his way to give us this freaking 'warning'?  We did order the second round of other sushis and rolls---a server wrote down all our orders on a piece of paper and ran to the back. The orders never came! We flagged down another server to follow up on our orders and the answer was they did not have our orders!!! Then why the heck that guy did not have the guts to come over and tell us that he'd lost the paper and ask us again what we ordered!  So much for our appetite, which was completely ruined. I hate to assume that this was their tactics to deter AYCE customers from ordering the food as they'd want, but all they had done so far left serious suspicion in our mind. We being nice customers does not mean that we are idiots. We wanted to talk to the manager. Guess what? The server walked away but the manager never came. Fine, enough is enough. We asked for our bill and that was the only thing that showed up right away. We paid the bill in full but left ZERO tips--yes, ZERO--never ever done this in my life, but this restaurant certainly earned it and it has a lot to catch up if they want to stay in business in the midst of tough competitions and bad economy.",

He got a beef teri bowl and after much debate, I decided with the all you can eat. Not too shabby, as it was $22.95 for dinner all you can eat. I got soo much food, it was amazing how much I ate. LOL i actually counted each individual order and added up the prices and I ate almost $60 dollars worth... if I would have chosen ala carte. Service was good, they weren't all up in your face rushing or watching you as you eat. That was nice. I had read a few reviews and some people were complaining about service, I didn't have a prob.

My last visit the food took awhile and the baked Alaska didn't look right.  As I was leaving I noticed their health grades were a B and a C.  That was worrisome.  Of course I got sick the next day.

Very successful restaurant I just wished they expand. As for the service I'll give them a 6 due to the fact that it is a ACYE restaurant and customers should always be attended every 10 mins or so. The carbonated drinks are always flats that's a big issue for me. They tend to leave the co2 drinks in a pitcher which eventually goes flat and they still unfortunately serve it. The servers are usually very nice. I've only had one bad experience with one server she was very rude and seemed bothered every time I'd ring the button there wouldn't be a reason for me to push the button if she'd constantly check on my table.  The food is absolutely amazing I lovee their crunch, xxl, california, Lisa Lisa rolls and many more. The shrimp tempora is always fresh and crispy. Bacon and asparagus & shrimps are very tasteful as well. Miso soup also delightful perfect temperature every time! The food is delicious never had a problem with the cooks.  I just really hope they open new locations and hire more staff so customers are well taken are off. I do recommend their food but if you have no patience I wouldn't suggest it.",

I will not recommend any of my friends to ever visit this place",

The only thing I had a problem with is that the restaurant is very small and the sushi was not great.... it was mediocre. We tried about 8 different rolls and about 10 different nigiris, all just tasted okay. I was a little disappointed because we had a friend in town and would like to have taken him to an amazing sushi house but that didn't happen. As much as the staff was very friendly, I would try other places first before I make a trip to Sushi Kaya again.",

The soup, salad, and appetizers are also included in the $20 all you can eat price which was so awesome!  Everyone must go here at least once!

Even if you're with somebody who doesn't enjoy sushi, there's enough on the AYCE menu to make a great meal out of. I love how they offer the \"half roll\" option for AYCE...more places should offer it too! You can try out more of their options that way.  It's a $10 uber ride from the Strip. Worth coming out if you're craving sushi and don't want to pay premium pricing on the Strip.   Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice? Save room for dessert! The green tea mochi is ON POINT!!!",

Every time I go here, I always start with an agedashi tofu to get things going. I've tried agedashi at other places and the one here is my favorite.  I love their baked rolls with my favorite being the California dream roll. It's a little on the heavy side so I usually do half order for it. I also like the lasagna.  I definitely recommend this place as you get your money's worth m. The wait times could be a little long sometimes, but it's not too terrible.",

I usually only order half rolls this way I can try more items without getting full too fast or to avoid wasting anything because there is a fee for over ordering.   One of my favorite rolls is the Jose roll.  It has soucy tuna on the inside and tuna on top with ponzu sauce and a jalepeno and some chile sprinkled on top if you can't handle anything too spicy this isn't the roll for you.  My kids love the Jackpot roll it has crab and tempura shrimp on the inside and on top temoura crumbs and a sweet sauce.  My husband get's the salmon skin roll and spider roll with out fail. We also like the garlic skewers, beef skewers, there are just so many options on their menu too many to list.  Miso soup, udon noodle soup. Plus you can get a scoop of icream and a piece of mochi for dessert.  They are always so friendly and all the servers work together as a team so your water cup is never empty someone is always checking to see if you need anything else.  Something we found out today if it's your birthday they will sing to you and bring you out a special dessert with a candle in it. My husband was a little embarrassed but she kept it low key.",

To our luck, it's their 10th anniversary so AYCE is around $23? bucks per person. SCORE!   We sat down and we got our drink orders and our waiter stopped by to take our order. Oh man is there a lot to choose from! Certain dishes like the uni is only one order per person. We had a total of 5 and 1/5 of us liked uni so lucky for that person, he got 10 pieces of it! All their fishes were pretty good. It wasn't amazing but what can I say, it's $23 bucks! We ordered a ton of food ranging from nigiri, to rolls, to tempura. We opted out for the noodles cause I wanted to save my stomach for the fish! Nomz!!! We were so full in the end but I still managed to sneak some dessert into my tummy. The mochi was meh....I got the mango mochi and it didn't really taste like mango. The cheesecake was alright, nothing too amazing.   All in all, it's $23 bucks, what can you say? I would definitely stop by again if I were to stay in town for a longer period of time.",

Sure enough, when we got there, it was a 20-30 minute which meant that this place is definitely popular among locals. It was a Wednesday night, during peak hours and we were able to find parking behind the building.  AYCE per person is $26.95 for dinner. Pretty much everything on the menu is part of the AYCE. There are a few items that you can only order once per person, everything else is unlimited! Sushi was exceptional, everything we ordered was very tasty. What I liked is that they don't include a lot of rice in the sushi rolls, which means you are able to eat more sushi!! Their menu is fairly large, especially their rolls, so choose wisely when picking your sushi unless you know you are going to eat it all.   In addition to sushi, they have appetizers, fried rice, fried noodles that are also part of the AYCE menu. Dessert is also included with your meal: ice cream or mochi ice cream, so make sure to save room at the end!  All of the servers were very attentive to our needs and our food always came out in a reasonable time. I can see why this place is highly recommended by others as well. I will definitely try to come back to eat here the next time I am in town.",

Tuna, salmon, crab, shrimp, eel, etc. Sometimes they combine different fruits and veggies with the seafood to make different varieties of rolls (avocado, mango, cucumber, daikon, etc). They even have a few riceless options for the carb-conscious customer. The fish is medium quality but that's understandable with an AYCE menu. I would not recommend the beef shish kabob. It's mostly fat.   I'm giving three stars for the 5 times different servers/busser/hostess came to the table to ask if we were ready to pay the check. I understand trying to get a good table turnover to make money but it was after 10 pm on a Monday with empty tables around us. I don't think there was a waiting list and we hadn't gone over the 90 minute max dining time. Even our friends with us, who are in the service industry, were a little taken back.",

We did all you can eat honestly you can do it anywhere in Vegas for same prices as 25$-30$ per person and we didn't order lots of food anyway!!! We had left few pieces of sushi like maybe 5% food on table the server didn't wanna give me the check she told me : finish the food like I'm 5 years old !!! I told her I want the check now don't waist my time please and she give me a hard time during my dinner time. She tells me I have to charge you for leftovers (doesn't makes sense) I told her charge me whatever you need and let me go.   She charge me additional 3$ total in the end !! So why to make all this drama for 3$ !?!?  As an owner for a place like that I'll be ashamed to called my self a business this is embarrassing! I'll never go there again unfortunately.",

First time: I wasn't eating all you can but I asked the guy if I would be able to switch. He rudely said \"No and if I catch you eating off their plates I will remove you myself.\" Our table laughed but he then said he was serious and \"don't try it.\"   Second time: We specifically ordered HALF rolls and they brought us full rolls. When we told the guy we asked for half rolls he said \"well you have to eat all of it because if you don't I'm charging you extra.\" WHAT!? talking about controlling issues.   The LAST time: The SAME GUY from the first visit saw my grandmother walk in and immediately embarrassed her! She gets around in a wheel chair and it would get stuck on chairs. He told her she had to leave because she's disturbing guests!! They weren't even disturbed especially since they were helping her. That was the last straw.   They have an occupancy sign which they don't follow. They've been on dirty dining in which they all of a sudden \"don't speak English\". They're rude, condescending and extremely temper mental.  NEVER going back and continuing to steer people away the best I can.",

We were a group of about 8 and the person who reserved the table and arrived before everyone was never asked if he wanted a drink. Was just brought water and he pretty much had to grab someone after 3 people had been to the table and asked everyone else what they wanted to drink to place a drink order. I then asked about a pitcher of sangria instead of ordering by the glass and the waiter pretty much looked at and explained to everyone except me the only person asking about the sangria that they have pitchers but ordering by the glass wads better...so at the end we all have our checks, I counted out in front of the people at the table with me the cash I was using and then putting the rest on my card and some how the amount in cash they took was different and charged my card more. I confirmed with the four people closest with me that I counted out a certain amount and everyone agreed. I caught a waiter and said hey I think my bill is off I have this amount. He instantly gets rude and said no you have this amount. I didn't even give him my bill I gave it to a female waitress. But everyone around me also said to him that it was the amount I said. He's still arguing telling me it wasn't. At this point I can see it's not getting anywhere so I say ok whatever and he proceeds to tell me he can pull the camera because I didn't give that amount and walks away. We all felt that was rude and asked to speak to a manager. The same waiter comes back and says he's a manager. I asked to speak to someone else and he says he's the only one so I proceed to tell him that his comment was rude and unnecessary after the fact I had said ok and stopped going back and forth with him and he proceeds to tell me I have a different amount and says that he's sorry I feel that way. He was very rude and none of us believe he was the only manager on duty. We come there all the time and have never had such terrible service and for sure will never be back again.",

The sushi was delicious.   Then the service changed and we had to wait about 15 mins for our server to come back around just to give us our check. Our table was obviously cleared and we were just sitting around waiting so I think it was pretty clear we were ready to leave.  Overall, sushi was great but if we arrived at 7pm and didn't leave until almost 10, I don't think I'll be coming here too often.",

I could tell you all the names of the rolls I had, but I can't remember them all. The sushi seemed fresh and the sauces were very flavorful. Most items came pretty quick.  Cooked items like the \"who is your dad\" took a little longer. We for sure got our money's worth.   The sushi was great, and I recommend it. A couple things kept it from 5 stars. 1) The waiter. As I mentioned, he was witty, but not an awesome waiter.  2) on several of the items, the presentation seemed a little sloppy. Sushi is an adventure and I would have liked a little more flair.",

The sushi was not fishy at all and we're all good.   EXCEPT....  Of course there's no uni!! The rice was more than warm. Rice is never suppose to warm in sushi. So that felt kinda gross in my mouth. Also they servers so slow! They take forever to bring out your food after you have ordered. Maybe it's a technique to get people full so they don't order anymore.   Pass on Sushi Kaya.",

    "text": "Sushi Kaya Never Disappoints.  I've tried other places for an AYCE Sushi and Sushi Kaya has to be the best so far (in my opinion).   The three amazing things that separate them from the rest.  1. Food of course! The sushi, sashimi (which is unfortunately only available for dinner), and side dishes are lovely. The sushi options from nigiri, rolls, and ect. never end! If your feeling daring and want to try something different like the Mango Roll which is sweet and refreshing. Or if you want something a little more familiar like a tempura roll, or maybe you'll want something that's artery clogging goodness like a deep fried roll? (I recommend getting half orders so you can try different rolls without getting too full!) The sashimi is fresh and the presentation is beautiful, and the side dishes range from spicy udon noodles to baked muscles. Desserts are also a really nice way to end the meal. (Ice cream mochi, cheese cake, or ice cream)  2. Music. It's a personal preference but I don't like it when a restaurant is silent. When the restaurant is silent, if feels weird talking because it sounds so loud. The music here ranges from K-Pop to todays hottest hits, a little bit of everything if you may.  3. Staff. The people here are really great. I feel that whenever someone's eating in an AYCE place and maybe someone runs out of water. It generally would be REALLY hard to flag someone down because they're so busy with other tables. But here they are really amazing by being really nice and attentive. They generally get all orders in, and nothing gets forgotten (if that happens it's really rare).  Sushi Kaya is a little pricy, but with great food, catchy music, and an awesome staff. I believe it's worth a try.",

Not even 2 hours later, my girlfriend & I were both extremely sick in the worst way. Lots of vomit. Safe to say we will never be back, it was the worst experience we've had at a sushi restaurant. The fish was either bad or mustn't have been prepared right. Aside from getting sick, the service wasn't great either. Our server wasn't easy to get ahold of to place our sushi orders through out the duration of our dinner. We kept having to ask other servers or bussers to find our server. All in all not a great experience.  **After a formal complaint was made with the health dept after our visit here, Sushi Kaya was on Dirty Dining 2 weeks later & received 35 demerits!",

The dinner rush is pretty overwhelming chance of a wait but well worth every minute. It was highly recommended the baked mussels is a \"Must\". I'm from an island and mussels is served many ways but the flavor is unforgettable! The choices you have for sushi is also something to be taken by. They have a wide selections for rolls and other dishes. From Kim chee fried rice to mochi for dessert literally all you can eat from start to finish.",

The price is great and so is the sushi.  They have tons of rolls to choose from and you never run out of options.  The Brooklyn roll is my favorite and if you like eel then it is a must try.  Even when it is busy the waitstaff is attentive and always keeps the food coming.  They offer a frequent buyer card too, so if you go to Kaya 8 times, then you get a free meal.    (If you plan on going Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait since it gets super busy)",

We sat at the sushi bar, which we have fine before and it took them a few minutes just to take our drink order. Our first order of sushi was taken, it was over the next 25 to 30 minutes to get all of our pieces. No-one came to check on us, refill drinks or take our next order till I flagged him down after 15 minutes. Again Ayer waiting for our dishes to come I sat passing on my phone because no-one came to check on us again. Again I had to flag down the waiter who seemed shocked that we were done. So when the check came, I normally tip 20% but only did 10% for this bad service.",

No gloves and no hand washing inbetween eating and prepping as a bonus! Then grabbing a dirty rag and using it to wipe up his hands because we all know just how unhygenic gloves can be. Upon mention to the manager the only reprimend told to the chef was change that dirty towel. Upon seeing these actions my wife became sick to her stomach and could not continue eating so we asked for our check. Now seeing as we had only begun to eat one would think that by no means we should have paid for both meals, perhaps a 50% off for this inconvience but instead we were met with a 20% off due to poor management. Now not to say we ate there alot, but in 2 weeks we spent $700 so yeah... This is not the place to make your regular spot... Infact avoid it all together because raw sushi can make you sick if not properly handled.",

    "text": "Visiting LV from LA, gf since HS and fellow Yelper took me to this quaint little establishment off the strip. It's not much from the outside, situated in a strip mall, as you walk in it's as if you walk into a little Japan. Inside is contemporary design, with cozy booths and tables.   Friend and I had the AYCE sushi, of course. Service was spot on, the food just kept coming and coming for a good part of 2 1/2 hours. And was all so wonderful on the palette. I think we ate just about everything on the menu. I have been to several other AYCE sushi establishments and have accepted that \"it is what it is\"...limited menu items, limited time to eat, and green tea ice cream for dessert. UGH!!!! There was none of that at Sushi Kaya. The AYCE includes a plethora of menu choices; appetizers, soups, noodles, sashimi, of course a wide range of sushi, AND desserts. When I say desserts, I don't mean just green tea ice cream, I mean you've got options. That was really surprising to me and I was very happy to be able to order several different desserts. Thinking back, we weren't rushed out like so many restaurants typically do for the purposes of turnover. Sitting relaxing catching up over AYCE sushi, now that's a day well spent.  When traveling I prefer to go where the locals go, and this is definitely a local place and I will definitely return the next time I'm in LV.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place based on its ambiance and nice menu options, as well as their 23 dollar AYCE option, but they fell short for me.  Kaya is a nice sushi bar to meet up after drinking or for a late night bite.  I love the decor in this place and the music is contemporary, so that's  nice.  What's missing from here is better service and food, in my opinion.  After reviewing their menu I found that their prices are reasonable, so we ordered tempura appetizer and 2 orders of their fried chicken.  While we waited we had some water, chatted for a few minutes, and then our tempura arrives.  Five dollars for 3 small shrimp?  REALLY???  I pay that much and I get at least 5 pieces or more everywhere else.  I guess it's because they are posh, or they think three is enough for two people.  I should've ordered one more, so that may have been my fault.  Twenty minutes later a plate comes out with lots of chicken, pickled radish mixed with carrots, and this shredded cabbage heap with ketchup and mayo latticed on top.  (see pic)  Interesting, but definitely NOT korean fried chicken.  I mean, technically it is because of where we bought it, but in terms of how it was prepared and how it came out, definitely not.  The chicken was fried TO DEATH--leather is easier to chew.  The crust is very crispy, but it won't save the leather within.  I love picked radish, but there's was definitely frozen and thawed somehow before serving it to me, because there was a ton of ice left in my dish mixed in with the radish.  Freaky.  I've never seen a restaurant use frozen daikon, or maybe there the first to get caught.  Either way it made it somewhat a challenge to eat because the radish was soggy to chew, which is honestly gross.  The salad was basically--when you mix the ketchup and mayo--thousand island dressing on salad, but I don't dig ice in my cabbage, either.  We tried their sushi, which was decent, such as their cali roll, but their tuna looked freakishly pink, so I assume they purchased the dyed fish.  you know, the ones dyed on purpose to not lose color when degrading?  it's an honest business, but it kills the flavor of the fish.  Overall I think if you want AYCE sushi, stick to that when coming here, but in terms of anything else on the menu, I'd be weary.  With my fried chicken experience on top of the sushi and small appetizer, I left sad.  I hate leaving full but sad.    I'll try this place again in six months, but for now, I refuse to walk through those doors again.",

We went here for lunch and it was a 19.95 for all you can eat lunch!  Winners!  I ordered everything off the one item only menu ( this is stuff that is too expensive to serve all you can eat)  They were all good.  Tempura was good and you could have ate your fill of that if you wanted too.  The miso soup was good, Cucumber salad was soso, Sushi fish was very fresh.   Their rolls were excellent and I wish my stomach was bigger because I definitely wanted to try a few more rolls but my stomach gave up.  Mochi ice cream was a nice topper for dessert.

It's already inconvenient and we haven't even started yet.  We came here in March 2015 for my best friend's birthday dinner. He made a reservation for us and we got there in a timely manner. (even with the ridiculous parking situation) It seemed like a busy night and it was quite crowded in their waiting area...if you could call the tiny hallway that. Front staff didn't seem to have any clue as to what we were there for. Eventually, we got seated in a private room right next to their \"host stand\". Our table was set up inside but very awkwardly. No menus on the table. The room looked like a storage room, there were tables and chairs stacked up on one wall and it felt like we got shoved in the storage closet! They left the door open to the room so people waiting kept coming in and sitting down because they thought that it was a wait room. I don't think any AC was working because we were dying in the room. Server had attitude with us. They needed our drink orders but WE HAD NO MENUS. He seemed really impatient with us and it was frustrating. We couldn't get settled in because of how they set up the table in this \"private dining room\". To be honest, it was just ghetto. We didn't get certain food we ordered, they kept bringing us food from other tables. Service was just atrocious. Food was eh. Nothing special about it at all. I've had better sushi, better service, better environment. Especially for what they charge. Definitely never coming back.",

Each time our server took an order, she would miss a couple things, then would later make an excuse of:  1) \"We ran out, because it's been so busy tonight!\" -Whatever, we were there at 9pm, you're open for another 5-hours lady, what you gonna do then?!? 2) \"The kitchen is really busy.\" -Is that really my problem? 3) Or simply, just ignoring the request by smiling instead. -Sorry lady, it's too late to play that no Engrish front on me.  In total, she failed on SIX plates due to one of the above reasons.  Sorry, that's not going to cut it, so I took it out of her tip.

Whilest not holding a huge desert menu, they have a few favorites such as mochi and choice selected house ice creams. Would recommend to local sushi enthusiasts. Although caution about the usual 45 min wait or so. With that being said, another restaurant to add to my locals \"favorite\" choices on nights on the town.",

    "text": "As I sit and reflect on my experience at Kaya i'm conflicted between giving this place between 4 or 5 stars. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and give it the extra star based on faithful service from our waitress.  We arrived around 8ish and left around 10:30ish. Each of us had the 22.95 all  you can eat special. I havent eaten anything serious all day and was really looking forward to this place. This probably wasnt a great idea. At first everything looked and tasted great but half way through everything seemed to taste the same.   Sushi Kaya is nice but lacks a lot of variety. On the specials menu there are 8 different types of California Rolls, the original, one with spicy tuna on it, one with spicy tuna and deep fried eel, one that's baked and topped with cream cheese, in the end it's the same old Cali Roll...  The miso soup was VERY bland but this is a sushi bar! Focus on the sushi man!  The best in my opinion is the 'ultimate albacore roll'. Albacore rolled with a slice of cucumber, topped with albacore and drizzled with spicy garlic pon...something sauce. Has a nice heat to it and is loaded with albacore.  Number 2 spot goes to the Spider Roll which is one of my favorite rolls, is often ordered first, and how i rate sushi spots. I know i shouldnt because the point of sushi is fresh raw fish but hey look at my picture i yell at pancakes..Anyway the spider roll was quite refreshing, drizzled with eel sauce and the soft shelled crab was quite nice, not too greasy and had a nice crisp in the center slices.  Number 3 went to one of the variations of the Cali Roll. Forgot what it was called but it was topped with spicy tuna and deep fried eel covered in eel sauce. The spicy tuna and the eel sauce had a nice balance to the overly bland and very basic not to mention cheap to mass produce Cali Roll.  There's a small corner of the menu dedicated to grilled skewers. There are limited to maybe two per person and are quite nice. Some are overcooked while others are a bit undercooked. For example the Beef tongues were overly bland and overcooked where as the bacon wrapped scallops were undercooked and wasnt to my own personal liking. The chicken gizzard skewers were great, would be a whole lot better if seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and sesame seed oil.  I would recommend this places to others but give better advice on things such as which rolls to avoid (the lasagna roll...dont touch with 10ft pole) and to order more 'premium' items to maximize the all you can eat bang to buck ratio (ahi poki appetizer, oyster shooters)",

But the rolls were smothered in sauces and the flavors didn't complement each other.  We had the scallop and bacon, beef and shrimp skewers - definitely yummy!  Sucks that you can only do one per customer  Seafood Udon - good amount of seafood and flavor in this dish but it is a big portion and definitely fills you up with non-sushi...  The fried calamari was not too greasy and just the right amount of chew.  Poke Salad - Very nice size portion and good chunks of tuna  Salmon, yellowtail, mackarel, halibut, white tuna, and squid were all fresh tasting and flavorful.  Good service but there was only one other occupied table while we were there.  So if you are going for AYCE with non-sushi eaters or if you stick to nigiri, this is a great place to come visit.  If you are looking for flavorful, creative and tasty rolls, I would go to one of the other many better AYCE places in town.",

Good robata/skewers (I like gizzards and bacon wrapped scallops the best but order them all), ahi poke is good, I love fried soft shell crab and can eat a bunch of those critters! Bulgogi was flavorful.   Kaya and spicy albacore rolls are favorites here, but I'm not really a roll person so \"favorite\" doesn't equate to fucking fantastic but just good. I wish they did half rolls as some rolls we ordered were just okay and didnt really want to eat a whole of something wrong.   Nigiri is hit and miss for me, few times were okay and some days top notch freshness- still a decent spread and not skimpy on the fish or rice heavy. It seems though the fresher times were a while back when it first started the AYCE and has since been lesser quality.   We've gone during quiet times like near when they open at 5pm and sometimes even the service is hit and miss then. We just have to wave her down sometimes as she'll be off doing something but not major neglect- just gotta be assertive sometimes to let them know you need something.   Docked the one star for the hit and miss service and one star for the no half rolls and also each time we've gone, more and more items have become \"one order per person\"...almost all the robatas except the potato and ginko and garlics are 1o.p.p. The nigiri quality wasn't as good the last visit.   It was a place I'd say was good, but now it stands as A-OK so I'm looking for a better place to AYCE.",

They offer unique rolls that I have never seen at other restaurants and they were all very tasty and fresh.  Our server was very attentive and kept checking to see what else we wanted to order and the food came out pretty quickly.  The Agedashi tofu was probably the best I've had anywhere, however the vegetable tempura was just fair.  Too many yams and potatoes and just one small piece of broccoli, but that's ok since it's all you can eat!  Kim chi fried rice was ok, but the calamari tempura was delicious.  There were 4 of us so we got lots of rolls and they were all awesome!  Had mochi ice cream and the cheesecake (can only order one of each) but that's ok since I was stuffed!

The calamari was the most tender I have ever had, bland, but relish. Potstickers were good. The filling (beef, mint, and noodles I think) was very flavorful but they would have been better steamed instead of fried. My husband had the Nemo roll and asked for smelt roe on top and I had the Red Dragon roll. Both were very good. Service was great, although after our appetizers we had to flag someone down to order our main courses but they weren't bothered by it and our waitress came by afterword. No harm, no foul. Would love to go again. The two tables beside us both had the AYCE options and they seemed pretty content as well. Not our style though.",

Although it is the cheapest in town for AYCE sushi, I am just not impressed with the selection. Many rave about the appetizers, & I have found that although the kimchi fried rice is good, I don't want to eat fried rice when I am eating sushi... it just doesn't make sense to me. Many of the rolls are made with nothing but fillers (i.e. avocado, cream cheese, crab mix) & no real substance.. aaaaand on top of that, the fish is no where near fresh. Their hamachi was YELLOW. Disgusting!  Oh, I also asked for my unagi to be crispy, expecting that it would be baked, but instead, they seared it with the torch! Yuck, again.  Their service is not the worst, but not the best. The lone male server, who I believe to be the manager, is the only one who was actually tending to us. Once he went on break, my bf & I were stuck waving someone fown.every time we needed something! I believe the only reason I didn't rate 1 star, is because I happen to like their hot tea, which comes in a steeping pot, and their ice cream, cherry amaretto & mocha almond. Both flavors that are unique to this restaurant, unless another restaurant is serving these, and just I haven't been to it yet.  -sigh-   I am actually regretting the fact that I even spent my hard-earned cash here!

My wife and daughter and I checked in around 715 pm (Sunday) and was told it would be at least 45 min wait. Not a problem,  we just walked down to the Asian mall and looked around. So yeah if you have Time to spare to do a little people watching its not a big deal.  Anyways came back about 45 min later within  minutes of our return they called us to be seated. $25 for AYCE.  We ordered tempura calamari, green mussels, and some other appetizers. Nothing to write  home about,  but not bad. The jalapeno  popper with crab and cream cheese was fire for sure. Loved it! Anyways I believe we ordered about 6 or 7 rolls.  Not bad at all,  just wasn't life changing either.  The service was amazing, food was fast and seem like there were plenty of staff to take orders.

It's right underneath Mother's Korean Garden and next to Anime Ramen. Like most places, it's open until 3 a.m. so good place to go to when near the Strip. We walked in around 1 a.m. and it was quite a hustle & bustle, however, we were quickly seated. The lighting was dark but the music was bumping so it made it fun and kept me from falling asleep.  The AYCE is around $25 per person so the typical price. Everything tasted fresh and quite palatable. My only complaint was that you couldn't get a half order, only on select rolls but the waitress didn't tell me which ones! Kimchi fried rice was awesome, very similar to the one at Ichiza.   Overall it was a great experience and I wouldn't mind trying it at a more decent hour.",

O.o I found it hard to believe at first and decided that I should order slowly because the portions might be huge and I didn't want to get charged for not eating everything. BUT GUESS WHAT? Portions were ON POINT & the sushi wasn't full of RICE. BTW, those skewers everyone's raving about are pretty BOMB. I think the best bacon I've ever tasted were the ones wrapped around their asparagus. BLAH! They also offer dessert on their ayce menu, get the mini cheesecake!

I agree with some of the reviews about the quality however and the one review about most of their specialty rolls being variations on a California Roll.     The big plus with this place is the non Sushi items included in the AYCE menu.  It's basically like going upstairs to Ichiza (another great restaurant in the complex) but you only are paying one flat fee.    Service wise this place has to have some of the best service I've ever seen at an AYCE joint.  That alone justifies a visit here.  Plus it's AYCE sushi is availible until 2am.  Also the ambiance of the restaurant is very cool.  Physically the lay out of this place is 10 times better than any AYCE sushi joint I have been to. So if it's late night and you have a craving for raw fish....KAYA IS THE PLACE!",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant late yesterday night. I appreciate the fact that this place is open til 3am.  Not quite sure how much I enjoyed the K-POP music playing in the background. I thought this was a Japanese restaurant? ;)  $24.99 for all you can eat sushi puts a bit of a dent in your pocket, so if you're gonna eat here, make sure you're either a) a big eater, or b) know to order the more expensive sushi to make your money back.  Decor is cute. Wooden planks, dim lighting, and comfortable.  I appreciate the huge assortment of sushi you can order on the All You Can Eat menu, from sashimi to rolls to your dependable appetizers like potstickers and sunomono.  Let me say this:  SERVICE WAS FAST. Not even 5 minutes after ordering and there was a roll waiting at our table already. The waitress was great. She constantly kept checking in, taking away empty plates, asking if we needed anything else and consistently filled our water. I appreciate that.  I ordered/tried the following:   Miso soup - Good, nothing fantastic or horrible about it. I don't think you can go wrong with miso soup really.  Zizzy roll - YUM YUM YUM. I really enjoyed this roll.  Spider crab roll - Very good also. I love me some soft shell crab. Not over cooked. Crunchy, soft, and savory.  Sex bomb roll - +5 for the naming convention. I just kept thinking of Tom Jones. Also very tasty.  Green tea mochi ice cream - I think they just gave me the Mikawaya brand mochi ice cream, which is totally fine because it's still tasty.  The rolls are huge. For a petite  girl I definitely overate (because I was determined to eat my money's worth).  All in all, great service, taste, dependable sushi, and open late nights so it makes a great hang-out spot.  I would definitely recommend visiting this place, provided you don't mind spending that kind of money.",

I signed up for Yelp just to rant about this place because I hope to save people from wasting their time and money here. Service was terrible! Food was decent, but the service was horrendous. It was a major turn off. She kept asking to take the plates. She even asked not once, but 3x when she saw a couple of pieces of sushi left on a plate if we could put it on the other plates so she could take it. Where have manners gone? I don't understand the rush because it was 9pm and there were 2 empty tables and no one waiting. All our plates were brought to us with no chopsticks, no napkins...nothing. We were a party of 8 with a mandatory 18% gratuity which I feel this $30 tip was stolen from us. I can't believe my sister recommended this place! She was with us though and said she will never go back. I'll stick to my usual sushi joint.",

Wait times for a Monday I thought was unusual but the place was full and we waited about 30 minutes. The place seemed bigger last time but I was wrong. We first started with the 1 order per person (1o.p.p) stuff first Uni, sweet shrimp, oysters, beef fire (?), then a assorted mix of fishes. Service was generally quick and cheerful and the wait times between courses was short. On to the robatayaki skewers tried most of them and all were hot crispy and cooked just right. Bacon sometimes just makes it better :) Everything was fresh and tasty with no real complaints except, It seems they put a lot of ponzu sauce on everything soaking the rice. For $24.99 a person is not too bad about the same as most places. Full and stuffed another AYCE completed!",

Just be warned that many of the choices are different variations of the California Roll.   This particular visit that I recently experienced started off well. There was a short wait for a Friday night and the hostesses were friendly. We had to wait for everything else! We had to wait for a drink order and to order rolls. When we were finally ready for dessert the waiter was no where to be found. We waited for 30 minutes for our waiter to even say anything to our table. Finally the table next to us sent over another server because they noticed we needed one. We decided to skip dessert because we were tired of waiting.   The most frustrating part was seeing the tables around us getting way better customer service than we did. We felt forgotten and ignored.",

    "text": "$24.95 AYCE sushi.  Sushi Kaya isn't that big.  Always ask to sit at the bar, you'll get quicker service that way.  I had a hard time trying to figure out what was what on the menu.  I'm so used to seeing the nigiri sushi in Romaji English.  I forgot this is Las Vegas.  I sat on the bar and listened to a couple of Mexican ladies complaining that the \"spicy\" sushi wasn't hot.  \"You call Jalapeno hot?\"  Oh, this is not going to be good.  They're pretty generous with the two-hour time limit.  I had a double order of nigiri maguro, hamachi, saba, unagi and sake - tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, eel and salmon.  The cuts were horrible, the fish undersized and the quality average.  The maguro was a light pink rather than a rich red, which would identify it as either previously frozen or possibly tombo - a low quality tuna.  On a positive note, the rice was served warm and portioned suitably for drinking/snacking.  Sushi Kaya has a large selection of specialty maki (handroll) with eye-catching names like Crazy Orgasm, Who is my dad? and Sex bomb,  I ordered the Lasagna Roll which consisted of a baked California Roll with Philly cream cheese and unagi sauce.  This was the best thing I had.  I also ordered the Viagra Roll - deep fried tempura style maki with maguro, sake, hamachi, avocado and masago (fish roe).  Not bad,  but not great either.  To round off my dinner I ordered the Sho Chiku Bai Nigori for $12.  Not a bad deal.  When I asked for my check I had 3 of 6 pieces of the Viagra Roll and 2 of 8 pieces of the Lasagna Roll on my plate.  The waitress informed me that if I didn't eat everything, the restaurant might charge me for the leftovers.  My response \"Go ahead if that's what you guys think is right.\"  I ate about $80 worth of sushi and sake in less than an hour.  Pretty good deal, but not the best sushi I've ever had.",

Everything I ordered the first round our server wrote down on paper. The edamame took over 20 minutes to come out. That was already disappointing. All the rolls came out a little after that. The 2 orders of Dynamite, grilled shrimp skewers & cucumber salad which is usually pre made was never sent out. I had to ask about the dynamite 3 times. I ordered a second round of sushi. Maybe 5 rolls. One of them was a baked roll & the server said it would take longer cause it's baked. Funny cause that's the roll that came out first! All the rolls came out & I still didn't get my Dynamite. When it did come out I started laughing cause the serving was the size of my palm! It wasn't even worth waiting for. The restaurant is nice inside. Small thought, but nice. The service was just terrible. My boyfriend has been here before & said the service was way better last two times I came here. Maybe it was just out server. She was the only one not in uniform. Just wearing a white shirt.   The buffet is priced at $24.95 per person not including drinks.  There is nothing special at all about their sushi rolls. If you look at the specialty menu they all say \"in:California roll\" or \"in:shrimp tempura\" with just different stuff on the outside.

    "text": "This is my go to AYCE sushi place since it's around the corner from my place...  I originally started coming here because they had fresh oysters and ahi poke... but they have since revised their menu... they still have poke... it's just sashimi poke... so its mixed fish...   the last time i was here they were packed and it took forever to be served... order... get served... and order again... so we were a bit leery about coming in again... but it was late and I had a sushi craving that needed to be fulfilled...  the parking lot was full... so we were a bit annoyed.... i hate the parking situation here... it's such a small lot... but THANK GOODNESS it wasn't busy... we were greeted right away... seated and our server was on the ball... after he brought our drinks he took our first order... they were out of SOFTSHELL CRAB... sad face =( ... but didn't surprise me... that used to happen when they had oysters...   anyways... SEX BOMB ROLL, SPICY TUNA ROLL, and SASHIMI POKE made our first round picks.... the poke is limited to one order per  person... i LOVE LOVE LOVE their Sex Bomb Roll... I think that's the reason we always come back... Next round we did half orders... so you get 4 pieces opposed to 8.. its nice so you are able to try new rolls... so we did half orders of the SEXY ROLL, SEX ON THE BEACH, and THE ONE NIGHT STAND... they were good... but not as good as a SEX BOMB... so I made another half order.... YUM! my tummy seemed full... but i needed to end off my dining experience with GREEN TEA MOCHI ICE CREAM (which is also limited to one per person)...   Sushi craving = Satisfied",

The who is your daddy which i order no cream cheese, no yum sauce or eel sauce was a joke they took one normal piece of shrimp which they pounded out thin and split it into 4 pieces wtf? I know they are trying so save cost fill u up on imitation crab and tempura batter + rice but that was quite unnecessary. I would never go back but I don't regret going there. go to Blue Fin...",

    "text": "Stopped here at the recommendation of a friend. I noticed a couple other places in the immediate area with no waits or few customers. Not so here, a good sign. We did the all you can eat. I'm generally weary when they put a time limit on it; 90 minutes here. However my worries were quickly put to rest as the service was extremely well. Our server brought multiple rolls and continually checked with us for additional orders. The time limit was not an issue and we did a goof job of sampling many different thongs on the menu. It also helped that most everything came in 1/2 size as well. Some rolls were better than others, but none were bad. Sample away. One tip- parking in the immediate lot can be difficult. We parked in the lot next door and had no problems.",

Since there's so many choices that sound good, I try to get a different roll (mixed with my faves) every time I come back. Every person gets one selection of sashimi, and usually I go for the salmon but the jalapeno yellowtail is amazing and is my choice of sashimi here. Their dessert selection is also pretty satisfying, you get number of choices between mochi and differenty types of cakes. Even though you only get to choose one, by dessert time I'm already way too full to have anything more than one. The servers are pretty lenient, and people at my table have gotten anyway with getting more than one dessert a couple times.   I'm from Washington, and have have visited Las Vegas a handful of times since I have family here. Every single time I visit, I make it a mission to come here at least once during my visit. Definite recommend.",

You can't go wrong AYCE appetizers and rolls as well as other things on the menu plus they give you a stamp card.  The wait is usually 30-45 minutes even though we have waited for an hour and 15 minutes one time it is well worth it! If we are meeting friends or family there we will just go early and by the time everyone arrives we already have a table! And the green tea mochi is amazing!",

Smelt Roe sushi actually consist of \"crispy\" seaweed, that is a plus, because most sushi restaurants serves soggy seaweeds.  Lots of items on the menu for the all you can eat option. Opting for the all you can eat menu, we we're able to order Udon noodle soup without the noodles.  This is important, because most restaurant showing poor customer service will simply say no or says it just can't be done.  Kimi fried rice were very good compared to restaurants that specializes in serving rice such  as Hong Kong cafes.  Im taking away one star, because their green tea ice cream does not contain the green tea taste and their menu does not have pictures (You'll need to know your food based on experience).

I told them i would like to sit at the bar so he placed us at the very corner of the bar where the server completely forgot about us and barely came by checked on us. I waited 10 mins for a server to come around, finally asked the sushi chwf if i can just order from him, he said no and that i can only order from the server.

Expect to wait for a bit, unless you have reservations but they only take reservations for parties over 10 and you can get their private room that fits 20 but everyone might be bumping elbows with 20. So if you have a big party try not to have more than 17. Parking sucks, it's a small lot so you might have wait for a spot to open or park else where. Other than that, love this spot! As I said Food is amazing",

    "text": "We came here for my friends 21st bday, it was a lil packed for a Tuesday night. There was like a 20 minute wait. Service was decent, we got bobas while we were waiting and were told we couldn't have them normally but they didn't see them so they let us keep them. They let my friend eat all you can eat by herself while the rest of us got al la carte which I thought was cool, restraints don't normally do that.   It was a pretty busy night, servers seemed really busy. We got our food in about 10 - 15 minutes which was not bad for how busy it was. Chinatown restaurants are always quite busy just cause it's such a small area and the best Asian restaurants are usually here. This place was a lil pricy not too bad. We came here because a couple of my friends recommended it. But I think it's a lil over hyped to be honest.   There's another sushi restaurant in the area called jjanga Japanese restaurant and they have great sushi and it's at a great price. And it's a lil off spring mountain \"china town\" so it's not as crowded.",

    "text": "Unfortunate two star review for a place with decent sushi. So for the good - the price is reasonable and the atmosphere has a great vibe. The bad is the lack of customer service on two fronts. As soon as my friend and I walked in, the hostess was pretty cold. We asked to borrow the menu, and when we did end up finishing, she quite rudely came up and asked, \"are you done?\" with no sense of hospitality.   Then, as soon as we got seated, no joke, ten seconds later, our waitress came over and asked if we were ready. Eeer... no? She stalked off looking annoyed. When ordering, I asked her a question, which she gave quick and short answers to. Seriously feeling the love here.  But the cherry on top was when another waitress had dropped off a couple of miso soup for me and my friend, and hurried off. Since we're from out of town and making this our first visit, I thought it was customary to get miso soup (like so many Japanese restaurant) and thought nothing of it. My friend was about to take a sip, when our waitress swooped in and asked \"did you guys order miso soup?\", to which we looked at each other confused, shook our head, and had the soup snatched from under us. No apology for the confusion, no explanation at all, nothing. It made us feel like crap and really made the rest of our experience just utterly sour. To be honest, in this case, she should have just given us the friggin soup and be cordial. It was just soup.  Aaaand finally, I had ordered just $6 worth of food and was about to pay with card. Nowhere did it say that they charge extra for under $10. She came by and said \"we charge a dollar extra for under $10\". I seriously hate when companies have minimum charges, but what I hated more was how she explained it.  Yes, I wrote an essay. Can you tell now how much this experience impacted me in a negative way? Pleaaase get better customer service. (Your busboy and busgirls were so much better).",

Our server didn't give us plates. When we asked another server walking by, she gave us a rude look before grabbing them for us.   One of the server was literally grabbing a quick bite at the sushi bar which is right in front of our table. Then he wiped his dirty hands on the back of the pants and walked away. I'm not sure if he even washed his hands afterwards. Later on, he was grabbing from the sushi bar with one hand and the other hand he was using his pinky finger to pick food out of his teeth.  Another server was carrying dirty stacked drinkware to the back. On the very top was the small black container that holds sugar packs. I saw him dropping off the sugar container on the self near the server station. He surely didn't wipe the container or check if the sugar packs got wet from the dirty drinkware.  My table saw many other disgusting things. I rather not get into too many details.  Never coming back.",

I only did so because the Chinatown area is so busy but I ended up eating here recently with a coworker.   We arrived at midnight and surprisingly was not as busy as I expected. Our server was very nice and patient as I proceeded to order as many plates of rolls as I could. I ordered from the baked rolls and the deep fried rolls for the most part since I have been hearing about others getting food poisoning... yikes.   I got the Crusty Philly Roll, the Monkey Brain Roll, The Who is your dad? Roll, the Volcano Roll, the Lasagna Roll, the Japanese Pizza, and the Ryan Roll.  Okay I didn't eat all these rolls by myself but I did inhale more than half of them. I would say all the rolls I have ordered were very good.  For dessert, I ordered the green tea cheesecake which was completely frozen We asked the server what was up with that and he just said it was sitting in the freezer. How disappointing but I wasn't even there for the dessert anyways.",

It has a very cute Japanese theme inside and it's always wildly busy  because they are very popular. I went during  lunch hour to eat the AYCE menu. I really loved everything I ordered and they served a lot of dishes with a decent mixture of my favorite ponzu sauce and eel sauce.  My favorite appetizers were the bacon and scallop skewers and the jalapeno poppers!   Their service is very quick. As soon as I placed an order it was on my table in two minutes or less. My cup never ran dry and they removed plates from tables as fast as they served it.  The really cool thing about this place is that they have an AYCE punch card and in your 10th visit your AYCE meal is free!!",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Pretty good ... for an after-hours drunken Chinatown chow-down ... and all of the experiences that come with such a joint.  This place has something very much in common with a lot of those Waffle Houses scattered around The Deep South. On weekends, at 2am, they are over-run with drunk clubbers gorging on massive amounts of quick & filling foodstuff!  At least that was True when I was called into service (from my home office desk) around that time by two fairly-intoxicated buddies who had landed there after indulging themselves in a nearby Spearmint Rhino experience. When I got there, sure enough, a scattering of bowls & plates evidenced they had already been belly-busting on a good bit of edamame, little tempura shrimp and deep-fried Cali rolls ... since this venue was running an AYCE deal at a base price of about $27.   And the entire place was just packed, packed I say, with younger folk, a lot of 'beautiful people' taking late-night advantage of that deal. Parking was horrendous; I waited my turn for a spot. Given this Chinatown venue was pretty close-in on Spring Mountain to Wynn & Venetian, one might first surmise these customers were recent graduates of the Universities of Tao, XS, Surrender or where ever. But, being ever-observant, I noted a lot of them were not dolled-up quite at that level, no serious BCBG cocktail dresses or such. But it was clear they had been livin' la vida loca somewhere ... that expected some level of \"dress-to-impress.\" Point being, if you want to people-gawk, yeah, this place works for you at this time of night. But if you are looking for upscale, cozy, chat-her-up late-night digs, this certainly isn't your best wager. I mean ACYE isn't usually going to strike the best first impression, anywho.  I'm gonna make a call here and say the name \"Kaya\" was taken as an abbreviation for \"Izakaya,\" that being Japanese for \"sake shop,\" a place that typically offers patrons AYCE dining with their sake. At bit odd, I thought, since these servers hardly looked Japanese. And I didn't see much in the way of sake flowing, or any other kind of booze; I suppose these clubbers knew when to flip from grog to grub.  Having once logged a sushi experience that has left an indelible impression, I went with a Teriyaki Chicken entree at $13. Tasty -- I mean who's gonna say oh-so-sweet teriyaki ain't tasty -- but I do say the portion was lacking. And the little side of broccoli looked pretty shriveled & tortured as well. Thank goodness for that glob of white rice and the bottle of soy sauce! I guess appetizers and teriyaki entrees and such are just menu-fillers for the odd duck (such as I); this place is all about the AYCE option. I also sampled some of the offerings my pals were having, other than the sushi. It was all reasonably tasty.   Service was willy-nilly given the crowd, but it sufficed; table-touches (at every table) occurred rapid-fire and repeatedly. I had to fill out a requisition for a fork. (Yeah, I'm chopsticks-challenged. So just put me on the shortbus, OK?)  All in all, I don't have any serious complaints. I cashed-out, bottom-line, $24 - soda, one of those little chewy ice-cream deserts, tax & tip. Which, again, was a message that the only solid play here is the AYCE. Too bad I am a card-carrying member of Sushi-holics Anonymous.  CONCLUSION: OK, it wasn't anywhere near being on my bucket list, but I suppose I can now say I did this joint. If anyone ever asks. I doubt I will return unless under similar duress. I've got other late-night Chinatown venues in my GPS I'd much rather prefer to investigate -- Pho Kim Long, Hobak Korean BBQ, Q Bistro, perhaps a Joyful House redux.",

    "text": "I came here about 2 weeks ago for a co workers going away dinner. We came with a party of 11 people for all you can eat sushi at around 25$ per person (u do the math). With a party this large, we were invited to a secluded room right next to the entrance. Upon entering this room I was very star struck. I felt like I was walking into a beat down motel 6.  1) there was dust on everything except for the tables and chairs. You could see dust from the ceiling and on the walls that probably landed in our sushi rolls & wallpaper was falling off the wall.  2) there was a bloody Band-Aid on the floor.  3) there was burn holes on the ceiling due from an electrical outlet (I believe) and there was a water sprinkler burned up and rotted.  4) service was slow and the waiter did not know which rolls had been served because there was multiple \"food runners\" delivering our rolls.  5) the speakers did not work and were only for show.   After all this discomfort I asked to speak with a manger. I asked the manager to close the door leading into our room. I asked him \"would you feel comfortable eating in a place like this\". The manager looks around the room and says \" yes, what's wrong with it\". After pointing out the 5 things I listed above he did not know what to say. He hesitated and after about 15 seconds of awkward silence he asks \"so what do you want me to do?\" I replied \"your the boss you tell me\". He exits the rooms and comes back 4 minutes later giving me 2 options. Option 1- we can take 15% off the tab. Option 2- we can take off the gratuity (18%) with 4 free socke shots. Option 1 is not even 5$ per person. Option 2 screws the server by taking off the tip (even though the manager claimed all tips were pulled) & gratuity is 'illegal'. After must disatisfaction i asked to speak with the owner, i was denied multiple times because she wasnt there. Which was a lie, the reason i couldnt speak with the owner was because she doesnt speak english. I am a worker in the hospitality industry for multiple years and this is absurd. I was not expecting a free meal but more than what was offered for what my friends and I experienced.   I want to eat at a place that takes pride in their bussiness and loves their customers. This clearly isnt the place that takes pride in anything other than filth. In Vegas a review and word of mouth go a long way. I will never return to this place & I will gladly take my business elsewhere. I took pictures of the room and will upload them with my review (hopefully yelp keeps them up)!",

Maybe I would have finished the food and not \"wasted\" any if it was good...  There is so much selection in Vegas that for the price, you'd be better off eating elsewhere.  Pros: - Good variety.  Has sushi rolls, nigiri, rice dishes, appetizers, skewers. - A few friendly servers - Can get smaller portions of all items. - Made to order and food was served fast (although not sure if it was too fast...) - Good indoor vibe/decor.  Cons: - Quality of food was not good. - Some of the food was just not that great.  Overcooked or bad flavor. - Forced to finish ALL the food. Not very lenient. - Pricey for the poor quality and bad taste of the food.  Must Try: - Nothing  Good to Order: - Agedashi Tofu - Nigiris - Sexy Bomb - Miso Soup  Avoid: - beef tongue skewer - beef don - salmon skin roll",

    "text": "OH MY GOSH!! The sushi here is DE-LI-CIOUS! I'm definitely stopping by on every trip I make to Vegas.. I'm surprised I've never tried this place before. The sushi was fresh. I completely recommend the ahi poke.. mm mm delish! && the sex bomb roll was a BIG hit at our table.  Now I have two concerns for the place... one of which is that the place is a little small so there may be quite a wait. We waited for 20 mins in order to be seated, but once we were seated, the ordering process & getting our food was fairly quick.   My next concern is the text on the menu that reads: \"we charge for leftovers\"... Though I understand the reasoning behind this, it had put quite a damp on our meal. It was our first time there so we were ordering items to try... you know, trial and error. But after reading that note, we were forced to eat EVERYTHING we ordered... even if we HATED it.. For about half the time we were there, we were more concerned about how to get rid of the items we didn't like rather than focusing on enjoying the other delicious items we ordered. Nexttime, we all plan on bringing some sort of plastic bag or something... because I refuse to be charged an extra fee because I didn't like a certain item that sounded better on the menu than in person. -- I don't suggest the jalepanos poppers... eck.  Here's another downside of the leftover clause... RICE is counted as a leftover, but they don't offer just sashimi on the menu... bummer.   Ahh, the review ended up sounding more negative than positive now, but trust me.. the place is worth a try... just order in moderation.. instead of ordering a ton at once, split it up and make sure you'll finish it or.. sneak in a doggie bag!",

I had almost a whole strawberry soju pitcher to myself. I was feeling amazing after that. Service was great. Our drinks stayed full and sushi kept on coming our way. We happened to get parking right in front. I have no complaints on this awesome place. The ice cream mochi was delicious. I would go back and recommend this place to anyone.",

Each time, I get a different server with each trip to the table, so there's always plenty of confusion between the 4 or 5 people running back and forth to the table.  Constant check issues, missing AND overcharged items; we tried to pay with cash at one point and the bill disappeared.  We found it hiding in one of the card wallets, but it took some finding.  Plain lack of attention.  I'm giving it a 2 because no mistake: the food items are tasty enough and the service entirely pleasant, but the last time I went--and it will be the last time--the presentation was so appalling I couldn't believe I was being served a sushi roll that looked that much a mess.  It was so sloppy-looking, absolutely no pride or skill in the food being served.  It tasted fine, not amazing, but it looked like it'd been dug up.  TL;DR: Pleasant but terribly disorganized service, decent but not stellar food presented poorly, be prepared for issues with the check.  Go upstairs to Ichiza instead and skip the irritation.",

So we were wandering around and decided on Sushi Kaya.  Walking in, there were still quite a few people in the restaurant and it was a pretty mixed crowd. I'll risk sounding like a snob but I totally gauge the customers who are in the restaurant. And, this place wasn't looking promising. As if to confirm that, we were sat next to a table with a few guys and as our server came to check on us, they were getting up to change tables. As he gets up and passes our server he grabs her ass and she was not pleased about it. I felt bad for her. As for him? Word that comes to mind? Disgusting.    The menu is extensive but most of the rolls are only ok. The skewers are one order of each per person and aren't all that impressive either. Overall the service was good and the rolls are decent. Good place if you're just trying places out but there are other AYCE places I would go to first.",

The next day we find out two of her other friends got food poisoning from eating there the night before we did. So I called the health apartment to find recommendations on what to do and they tell me reports came in of the same thing a few days prior. I've never been this sick in my entire life. The manager said that I need to go to the hospital to prove a diagnosis of food poisoning. Only problem is I cannot miss work and I had work that next night and the next morning after that. The manager said that they would pay for our hospital bills, but after telling him that I am not able to make it to the hospital they had no other accommodations to offer not even a simple refund. There must've been some cross contamination or mishandling of temperatures with the meats, probably both. You've been warned!",

I wish I would have written down the names of my other favorites because there are many! My boyfriend is addicted to edamame so thankfully that was on the AYCE also.

The place was full and we were told to wait in a room off to the side (karaoke room) so we went there and waited. Then we realized people that came in after us were getting seated before us. The waiter forgot (?) that we were there. My husband was hungry so he got out and stood where they could see him and FINALLY we got seated.  When we got seated, I asked for a high chair for my son and the waitress asked me how many high chairs I wanted. Hmmmmmmmm....did she think we (adults) wanted to be seated in high chairs as well? Clearly, we only had ONE baby with us. Later the same waitress came to take our orders. My husband got all you can eat sushi and I didn't. She said it's okay as long as we don't share food. My husband put orders for his all you can eat meal and I studied the menu for something my son can eat. I asked for japchae and white rice for the baby. She said the rice is $1. I said that's fine. Then I realized that japchae and the rice were both included in the all you can eat menu. The waitress knew I got that for my 17 months old son. I know my husband can't share his meal with me but couldnt' he have fed my son off his menu?? I didn't really want to eat there so I just got an order of Norwegian mackarel (this was good btw) and had that for dinner.   BTW, their all you can eat menu isn't really all you can eat. Probably about 30% of it is marked where you can only place one order of those items. I gave it a 3 stars because my husband liked trying various different items off the all you can eat menu. He didn't have any rolls but just sushi and yakitori (skewers) items. He, however, wasn't happy that they seated other people ahead of us and how quickly the waiter tried to drop off the check. (He brought us the check right after they brought his first orders from all you can eat menu.) He said he felt like they wanted us out.",

    "text": "Where to start...  So I've been coming to Sushi Kaya for about 3 years now. It wasn't always as busy as it is today, but the service/food was definitely better a couple years ago. Staff was always polite, and the food came out quickly. However, that's different now. I'm assuming they've undergone some recent changes this year, because this restaurant has done a complete 360.   Went in with a friend for AYCE, and the food didn't seem as cold as it should've been, but we didn't pay too much attention. Stuffed ourselves, even had 2 desserts lol!   Next day my two friends tell me they got food poisoning from there, which scares me since I just went with my friend as well. I wasn't sick yet, so I was being positive. The next morning I had a few terrible episodes in the bathroom and I knew immediately! I couldn't even keep water down, and stayed in the bathroom for half the day. PLEASE save your money! It is NOT the same restaurant it used to be. I am literally disgusted.  Contacted the Health Department and apparently Sushi Kaya has been getting a ton of complaints.",

    "text": "This is a great sushi place.  It's unlimited but different than most.  Most sushi places have the basic apps and a list of rolls to chose from for all you can eat.  Sushi Kaya is unique cause they have a huge appetizer menu that even has grilled shrimp and mushrooms and steak and other fun stuff.  You literally can graze on so many appetizers before you even hit the sushi menu.  Then you start ordering sushi and it's so good.  The diversity of the number of rolls they have is fantastic.   This is a big place and is always packed. But in my opinion it's well worth the wait.  I've been several times and it's always great.  The service is fast and friendly and the quality of food is delicious.  It's a bit higher cost for the all you can eat but they're open late night and the extras you get are worth the price you pay if not more.   I'm excited to go back.",

I could not believe it . The entire dinner my son did not even get a refill. The sushi was decent.. I would recommend trying another Sushi spot. There are literally thousands in Las Vegas.

    "text": "My friends and I were craving sushi, so my husband and I took their advice and went to one of their favorite spots. After maneuvering through the crowded parking lot and putting our names on the wait list, it became obvious that this all-you-can-eat spot is not just THEIR favorite but a fave among many. And for good reason...   I love AYCE sushi restaurants because you can try a lot of new items. Sushi Kaya has a huge menu, from regular nigiri sushi to special rolls, tempura, and even Korean dishes like bulgogi and kimchi fried rice. We each basically stuck with sushi and rolls, although we shared some garlic edamame and seaweed salad. (The menu says \"no sharing,\" but that didn't seem to be a problem -- and why should it be?)  As usual, my husband and I ordered lots of eel and hamachi, with a variety of rolls. The black dragon roll (California roll with eel and avocado) was my favorite, but everything was good, and it was nice that you could order half rolls as well. I'd also never had mochi ice cream before, and on my friends' recommendation, I tried it for dessert. LOVED it! (My husband did not agree.) Reminded me of a small scoop of ice cream wrapped in Botan rice candy.  Service was quick and efficient, although one of my friends' orders was never delivered. But as it's AYCE, I say just order it again! (And if you come with a large party, you know someone will eat it!) Unfortunately, you don't want to eat garlic edamame while everyone else is eating mochi...  Sushi Kaya is right in the middle of Chinatown and, as I said, the (small) parking lot is a nightmare. But you can park right next door at Chinatown Plaza and walk over (which I suggest you do). And if the restaurant is too crowded, there are plenty of other choices nearby where you can dine. But I suggest that you wait and try Sushi Kaya. Good food, large menu, and -- although it's new to my palate -- MOCHI!",

I just went again a little over a week ago and unfortunately experienced one of the worst services I've had at any restaurant.  After we ordered, our waiter gradually disappeared the further we got into our meal. At first we had to wait on water and then it just became a wait for everything. My date was going to order dessert with his AYCE but gave up after a good 20 minutes of looking around for our waiter to appear. Someone at the table next to us ended up raising her hand to get the attention of another worker (maybe the manager?) who helped us all and prompted the waiter to give our check. When the waiter finally came back with our check, he was impolite and didn't say anything like \"sorry to make you wait\" or \"have a nice night\" and it made the whole thing that much worse.  We've never had a problem with the service at Kaya so this visit was highly disappointing. I would probably still go back because I enjoy the place and people overall, but definitely would not hope to get that same waiter again.",

    "text": "As tourists to Vegas we enjoy finding new places and this was a huge treat! We had been going to the same sushi place for a while when we visited, but something made us decide variety is the spice of life! So we decided to look around again.  I called one sushi place near me and they offered Kaya to me for AYCE. I am so glad they did. At first we knew we were in a great neighborhood for food as we have eaten in the area and there are many great offerings near here. We arrived before they opened and were seated quickly. Everything was very tasty, but the one item that really made an impression on me was the mussels. At first I was concerned because they were covered in cheese. (cooking shows say \"Seafood and cheese do not mix\") Well, guess what? These were amazing! My husband never eats sushi mussels because they are usually drowning in mayonnaise but he too enjoyed these! Actually, we tried many items on their AYCE menu, and the skewers were also a nice surprise that many places do not offer.  At dinner you can even get sashimi! Great price, great food! The only reason they got one less star, the waiter seemed upset or was basically not at all friendly the entire visit. One female with glasses on was full of smiles and helped us also, but the man wasn't happy to be there or I don't know- just not professional demeanor to me. Smile- your restaurant might be the highlight of someone's trip to Vegas!",

This by far is the WORST restaurant I've been to! First time last year was a bad experience but I dont really base this on my first time. I gave them a chance this year to see if they improved. The servers are the rudest especially the guy manager who thinks we owe him. There were 16 of us and for $35 a person, we expected to be treated right. He told us they are so busy but at least 6 of teh workers are standing in the hallway just chatting. MEL a lady server just dropped a plate on our table and took off like she wanted to punish us. They told us we only have 90 minutes to eat but they're too damn slow and I only had 4 very small plates 2 pc sushi each for 90 mins! If u want your money worth, skip this place.",

They were also very fresh, especially the ebi(shrimp) nigiri! I go to many sushi places and they're always mediocre quality but this place serves the shrimp perfectly! I liked how they did half rolls as well so you can have more variety before getting full! The rolls are yummy too!  The service wowed me even more! As soon as I walked in they were all so nice, welcoming, and friendly! I asked for take out at first and the waitress sat me at the bar unlike most places that just let you stand or sit at the benches!   I love this place and will definitely be coming back! I haven't found too many sushi places that get my shrimp fresh and big like they do (besides extremely expensive high end sushi restaurants!) this one is a really good deal for 26.95 :)))) thanks to them!",

I'm not sure if it was just the day I went, but the table I sat was a bit sticky.

After taking our order, the table next to us complained about their lasagna roll tasting weird, they are also regulars. The server loudly sighed and said \"do you want another one or?\" I completely understand how it is working in customer service. I've been doing it for almost 6 years. She checked on us maybe twice. We ordered a few beers which never showed up to our table. She seemed extremely impatient while we asked questions about the menu.

Otherwise, if you're a nigiri kind of person, it really isn't worth the five dollars you'll save by going here instead of some other AYCE sushi joints that are open late.   The fish and seafood is lacking. The textures range from decent to oh-god-gritty-sea-urchin, which can really break an evening and a tooth or two. Some of the fish nigiri were unusually fishy, especially the salmon, which was uncharacteristically lacking sweetness. There's also a clear excess of rice on the nigiri and rolls, and while I understand that the establishment does need to break even, it always seems underhanded to do it with the rice overage method. There's just... nothing the guest can do about it, but to be bitter and be filled prematurely with rice for fear of Leftover Charges.  Fortunately, the appetizers and other dishes are very good, and are actually worth the all-you-can-eat space to try, especially since you won't be missing out on much anyway from the bad seafood. The desserts are good too, but it was a bit strange that they were out of stock of more than half the dessert menu. The service is pretty friendly too, which is nice and well-appreciated especially considering how busy the place was and how late it was at the time. They'll let members of your dining party do a la carte ordering while others do AYCE, too, which really must be inconvenient for them, but is a great service to us, so thank you, Sushi Kaya.  Now, if you'd serve me some better nigiri, and keep the plum wine ice cream in stock, that would be even better.",

I would recommend this place for you Sushi lovers. Only negative thing I observed was our waiter and waitress seemed mad and they were not friendly. It also seemed they didn't want to be there working. But the food came fast and drinks too.",

The first time we did AYCE here, the waitress brought us our orders quite quickly which surprised me because we often eat at Sushi Mon and the wait there gets ridiculous as well as getting your orders (sometimes, gotta flag down the waiters). The food here is okay. The ambiance is not so bad either, but this place did not ignite a special bond within me so it's whatever.  The food is great though, so I'm not really complaining!  Food Quality: 3.5 of 5 Ambiance: 3 of 5 Staff Service: 3 of 5 (hit and miss--sometimes cool staff serving, sometimes not) Overall: 3.5 of 5  Will definitely come back again, but not any time soon. Worth trying though!",

    "text": "After being here over 10 times in the last year, I feel like it would be appropriate to review my favorite, yes you heard me right, my favorite sushi joint in Las Vegas.  Sushi is this kind of sandstorm that hit, from my observation at least, hard and hasn't left. You can go everywhere and find sushi restaurant on almost every other block these days. I take the undeniable pride in having tried many of the places around the valley and this is my favorite, on a wide spectrum.  Sushi Kaya is \"hidden\" in the corner of a restaurant complex but you'll always find it packed. The place is a little small, so often on the weekends if you're coming here the wait times can be on the higher end. Another complaint is, sometimes the service is a little on the crappy side. Like people forget to acknowledge you, the good thing about that is that each table has a \"call\" button that is quite useful.  Other than that, the rolls and nigiri are all very good. I'm not quite sure the days they get their shipments, but I've never had an experience where the fish did not taste fresh. I always order a boatload of salmon nigiri and I have never been disappointed. The unagi is always delicious and fresh on the bright side and homeboys and homegirls... I LOVE MY UNAGI!  My favorite roll is the \"Sex Bomb\" roll. Very delicious. I might as well be there house specialty, because it is the right amount of everything. I also always order the Brooklyn Bridge roll and the Spider roll. There are very few rolls that aren't good, in fact, I've never been disappointed with any of the rolls I've had. The desert is always good, they give you unlimited ice cream and I always get the mango or strawberry mochi.   All in all, this is my favorite place because the whole experience. There was one instance I left and hated it, but it was because of the service on what seemed like a slow night. As you can probably tell, I forgave but sure as hell will not forget. BUUUUTTTT! I will always to continue coming back, because it's just that good!",

It was partly crowded and had to wait 5 minutes for a table which is normal. Waiter was friendly and courteous to my dehydration needs. The sushi was good, I highly recommend the \"sex bomb\" roll if you likes baked sushi. It was delectable. I ordered a seaweed salad and miso soup to start with. I was not a fan of the \"one night stand roll\" you pretty much pay for the name not the quality of the roll. I next ordered the \"tornado roll\" which was alright. It was standard which had the cheese, crab, cucumber and avocado.(as did most of the rolls had) it is an AVERAGE sushi spot. Is it the best in Vegas... Probably not. I would come again for a quick sushi place. I would rather go to sushi goyemon or ra sushi.",

I'm a generous tipper especially when my wait staff is nice and I probably would've tipped more but oh well.

It's the only place I've seen this kind of sushi. Although I admit their desserts could be better . I love chocolate and they only have fruity desserts. The only chocolate you will find there is in the cheesecake.   If your from out of state , AYCE sushi in Vegas is like a new experience . Every state out of Vegas that offers AYCE sushi does not offer as many appetizers and rolls for the same price . Take advantage of AYCE in Vegas at sushi kaya!",

Go to Sushi Koma or Goyemon, there you will have really fresh nigiri.  There is a huge selection of appetizers which includes skewers. They were not really Japanese style but tasted pretty ok.  I don't usually eat rolls so I can't really comment too much on it, but there is a huge selection of rolls for you to choose from.  The service was pretty good. The gentleman asked us frequently if we needed refills or additional orders. However, it's the only sushi place I've been to that would bring your bills without being requested. Not a big deal to me but some people may care, especially when the place is almost empty.   Overall, an average AYCE sushi place with so-so nigiri but a huge selection of appetizers and rolls. I may give it another try and hopefully there will be fresher fish then.",

Even the sushi was mostly good, some of the rice tasted old or not cooked right and didn't stick together properly, also didn't feel right when chewing. A couple of the rolls were funky and the spicy fish had a weird texture that was off putting. So for the rice, the texture and other things that will not be mentioned, I will not be back.",

They have an outstanding selection of flavored Saki and a very creative selection of sushi rolls.  Service was outstanding, the atmosphere was very pleasant, and most importantly the fish was fresh!  I always say the prime quality indicator of fish freshness will be how busy the place is, in other words, how fast they have to refresh their fish stocks.  Sushi Kaya clearly has a loyal following and they can now add me that list.  It is lively place and would be good to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks to have a great time.",

Then, on top of that, the sushi wasn't as good as it usually is, and the fish wasn't that fresh. It was kind of dried out and wilted. Yuck.

The staff is incredibly accommodating and ask you every 10 minutes how everyone is going and if you need anything else. I love the hilarious names they have given their rolls like \"one night stand\" and \"I love my butt\" which are both delicious by the way. I also live the bacon wrapped scallops, grilled shrimp, and cucumber salad. I seriously have never left this place unsatisfied or without a full belly lol. I highly recommend that anyone living in Las Vegas or visiting come check out this deliciously affordable place and maybe after you get that full belly you can go next door and jam out to Karaoke at Zizzy's like I always do lol",

We usually do all-you-can-eat, and start off with miso soup and seaweed salad. I love their spicy tuna, sashimi, yellowtail, and albacore. They have a nice fish-to-rice too ratio since some places give way too much rice! I love their mochi as a dessert. The service is usually great every time. It doesn't take long when we order for our AYCE sushi.  This place gets packed on the weekends, and for good reason! I would wait the 20 minutes or make it easier for yourself, and call ahead of time to make reservations.",

    "text": "Although this place is in my top 3 doesn't mean I'd choose this place over my top 2.   Nigiri: 3/5 They definitely serve more rice and less fish here. I usually get a huge clump of rice and a small thin thin thin slice of fish. Everyone knows rice fills people up quicker. So its kind of shady how they con people into eating a lot of rice to fill them up.   Rolls: 2/5 I'm not much of a roll person but when I eat AYCE I like to try a little bit of everything and Kaya is the only sushi restaurant that I go to that doesn't allow half rolls until the last roll of your dinner. Which makes it sucky to even try rolls because usually 1 roll can fill me up with all that rice.   Appetizers: 4/5 Only if you get AYCE everyone knows you never really get your moneys worth in sushi unless you go All you can eat. Their baked green mussels are pretty good out of my top 3 its my 2nd favorite, although they take kind of long to come out they're usually never burnt or over cooked and there's a balanced amount of yum yum sauce to mussel. Sea weed salad, if your not doing AYCE  sea weed salads a small portion and not worth it but with AYCE you can order as many as you want. I also like their sweet shrimp skewers Its the only sushi restaurant I know that offers grilled shrimp skewers  AYCE: 5/5 To be honest its the cheapest dinner AYCE I know of in Vegas I think for 22.99? something like that but its the cheapest of my top 3.",

They already out of Uni. $27 for dinner ($6 more than lunch) they offer 3 more items, Uni been one of them. And that's one of the reason we visit here -- for the Uni.  All right, things happens, we understand. So we asked nicely if they could substitute uni with sweet shrimp (one of other 3 items they offer in dinner). To our surprise, the waitress said \"no, the manager doesn't allow\".  Then we asked to speak with manager and explained our point: if we pay for the dinner -- extra money for the extra stuffs, we should be served those items. If for any reason restaurant is out of certain items, then we should be offered equal/similar value substitute. The manager then told us that it was the owner's decision: once it's out, that's it. No substitute at all. They can not offer substitute every-time when they are out of uni, otherwise they will be out of sweet shrimp or other wanted items soon. (Really? 6:30 you already out of Uni? And sounds like it happens ALOT.)  Translation:\"Bait and switch? Are You Kidding Me?! I won't even bother to offer customers replacement or substitute. Yet I'm still going to charge them FULL PRICE. Because... look, my restaurant is packed at night. Why should I care?\"  Well, We do. And we are not going back. Evar!",

We had two waiters coming back and forth to us one bringing us water and another bringing out our food. The sushi was good. I had a spicy tuna roll, the Jose and California roll all very good. Of course I've had better but it being about my fourth time eating sushi I would put this in third as my top three favorite places. My only problem that I would of had that I didn't give 5 stars is that it was hard to get some of the servers attention but other than that everything was good.",

Servers are very attentive and hosts are wary of their guests when there's a wait time. The food is great: recommend the Who's Your Daddy which is needed in every table. With their nigiri, the fish to rice ratio is appropriate for their size. With their servings for appetizers, take note of their serving size as they do vary when you're doing AYCE. I see no reason of not going back here repeatedly when you have a sushi craving.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Sushi Kaya for more than 5 years and every visit has been enjoyable each time. Right when you walk in they have a small waiting area and a headwaiter/waitress to take your count of your party and will call you when notified. There are 3 choices of where you may sit; booth, table, or bar. Usually by sitting at the bar you'll be seated faster compared to the other two.  Appetizers: bacon & scallop skewers, garlic edamame, miso soup, shrimp tempura, pot stickers, and the baked green mussels are my go to orders. I highly suggest that if you're interested in the baked green mussels, order them first!!! It takes time for them to prepare/cook the mussels. Nigiri: salmon, tuna, unagi, and albacore are my favorites. With every visit the slices of fish is always greater than the rice. This is where you get your bang for your buck with AYCE sushi.  Noodles & Rice: the Korean jabchae and the chicken fried rice taste amazing but sometimes it can be a little bit oily.  Special Rolls: the crunch, cinderella, rainbow, and the sex bomb rolls are my favorites. The best part about all the rolls (excluding fried rolls), you may order a full (8 pieces) or half roll (4 pieces).  Baked Rolls: the lasagna roll is my absolute favorite off of this entire menu! When they cook it right, the roll just melts in your mouth and the cream cheese with the eel sauce makes a great savory combination.  Fried Rolls: the California dream roll and the crusty Philly roll taste amazing but the downside is that the rolls are huge. I rarely order these rolls because they really fill me up.  Desserts: all of their desserts taste amazing! But also know you are limited with the mochi and the mini cheese cakes.  I would like to give this place 3.5 out of 5 stars. The main reason for the average rating is for their service. There will be moments when I order a half roll or nigiri and I don't get the order until 15 to 20 minutes later. That wait may not seem so long but when you're limited to 90 minutes it takes up some time. With AYCE sushi places, time is off the essence. If I'm waiting for 20 minutes for a dish, I end up forgetting about what I ordered or I'm constantly asking the waiter/waitress if I may order more.",

I came here by accident and it's incredible seeing how this restaurant is very popular and busy. I was told the wait would be around 30 minutes and given that it's almost midnight, I opted for take-out. I ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice ($8.95), Vegetable Yaki Udon ($8.95) and Teriyaki Chicken ($12.95). Thankfully the wait wasn't long. It did take approximately 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Everything was sealed in a foil and the containers were packed well in a big paper bag, which I think is a major plus because nothing toppled over or spilled.  I'm actually quite impress with the distinct flavor of each order. The Kimchi Fried Rice, which is top with fried egg and sesame seeds, has an earthy and subtle spicy taste. I especially like the thick noodles and savory sauce from the Vegetable Yaki Udon. And the Teriyaki Chicken is nicely cooked, the meat is juicy and tender. Now the veggies that came with the Teriyaki Chicken are charred and crispy, and I wish there was more of it because I really like this texture. Also the meal includes a side of white rice and miso soup. Now I'm not able to eat certain seafood so I gave away the shrimp tempura. But I am definitely coming back to try other items on the menu. Hopefully I'll get to dine-in and have my dessert too.",

As we were waiting for our order come out, I saw them microwaving the shrimp tempura, which would make sense as to why it tasted as dry as it did when it came out. The rolls didn't taste so fresh and the service was awful. My waitress never came to check on us after bringing us the food, I had to call her to ask for spicy mayo, I was brought a different sauce, had to call her again to correct it and bring the right sauce, and call her when I was ready for the check. You would think the place was swarming with customers for the service to be so poor, but my sister and I were the only ones in the restaurant...  All in all, I wouldn't go back. Much better sushi places to eat at!",

    "text": "Ordered a la carte three rolls. Other than the Alaskan roll I don't remember the names but two, including the Alaskan, were \"California rolls\" topped and the third was spicy tuna roll topped.   The two \"Cali rolls\" were terrible. For some perspective they're the same size as the $6 Cali roll but with the $12.50 price tag because the one had eel topping and the other a tuna topping - and not hugely topped either. Perhaps my expectations of a $12+ rolls are skawonky but when a saucer is plated with rolls the size of Halloween chocolate-sized slathered in Hershey syrup I'm annoyed. More perspective, the third roll was as big as the two Cali rolls put together. Finally, they use cheap rice. Rice was cooked with too much water (makes it soggier) and was a long grain - probably Jasmine instead of Calrose - so it lakes decent texture and flavor.   Needless to say I'm disappointed that a) we waited 45 minutes for a seat b) I don't feel that I got my money's worth.   I get that this is a AYCE, and my bad for assuming they prepare a la carte rolls differently, but my wife isn't a big eater and normally two regular rolls and an el cheapo Cali roll is more than enough between the two of us.",

    "text": "This is a good place to go for AYCE sushi. This was actually the first place I ever went for an AYCE sushi.   Despite of my nationality-- I am not big on white rice. I know I know, \"but you're Filipino?\" Lol I just converted to brown rice about a year and a half ago & I rarely ever touch white rice. With that being said, sushi isn't one of the foods I normally eat.    Most recent visit, I came here on a Sunday for lunch. Wasn't packed like it usually is during dinner time. Lunch is about 20$ where as dinner is about 25$. Service was quick  and up to par. Waitress came back every few minutes to check on us. We ordered half rolls instead of full rolls. I learned my lesson last time I ate AYCE. My taste palette hates eating the same roll over & over so half rolls are the best way to go.   We ordered few different rolls. Ones that stuck out to me & had to order another roll was-- Cinderella roll & lasagna roll! Must try those! I love any rolls that have cream cheese in it & is baked. Melts in your mouth.   After this sushi craving. I'm probably good for about 2 years. Ate way too much sushi lol I could barely breath!",

Pretty sure the soup is suppose to be hot. Anyways the menu is huge, it's open late, the sushi isn't bad.",

    "text": "As I'm reading the past reviews people have left for this restaurant, it leaves me baffled why this place would get a low rating. I loved it here.   The service was amazing. To all those yelpers who complain about getting charged for extra food, most likely there was a lot food left over and I bet the server didn't MAKE you eat the food and she kindly asked you because it sucks when we have to charge you extra. It's not the waitress being mean to you, it's the owners rule. Why don't you try ordering less or just don't come at all. It's ridiculous to see you guys give a one star to this place because you couldn't finish your food or could sit where you want to sit. The only problem with the service was maybe if they could just let me relax and eat that would've been nice, I didn't like being asked repetitively whether I would like to order more as there is food on my table but maybe their really on it for customer service because of dumb reviews like I've read on here.   The sushi was great, I love their salmon belly and their Uni was awesome. The bacon and scallop skewers and the beef skewers were the best I've ever tasted. I've worked/eaten at my fair share of ayce sushi, LITERALLY the best. I feel like this ayce sushi is much more high quality than most I've been too. Even the mussels were larger than most ayce sushi places too. One thing I didn't like was that the rice and sushi ratio was very inconsistent. Sometimes I'd get less rice and sometimes I'd get 90 percent rice, I know that you guys just slinky slice the fish and try to make it look big but it doesn't work on me so if it's okay don't do that because it disappoints happy customers like me. However that would not stop me from coming to an amazing place like this. Will definitely be taking my sister soon.",

My name was was second on the list and they were crazy slow. It took them 15 minutes to seat us. The hostess called our name and and asked if we needed a high chair I said yes and we followed her thinking we were ready for our table. She ignores the fact we are all standing in the middle of the walk way when I stated is this our table and she said no I didn't call you guys but yet she put a high chair at the table. So my family sits back down. The. She sits a lady with a baby at a table that can fit 6 people. From my previous experiences your whole party must be here to be seated. So instead of us getting that table we get put at a table that fits 4 people and they are all out of high chairs. She then asked if we wanted a pillow for the baby to sit on and we say yes. She forgets and 30 minutes go by still no pillow. And for the time I sit at this crowded table I stare at the lady who has a baby sit at the table by themselves for a good 30minutes before her party shows up. That's only the beginning. We order food and have to constantly have to follow up on the food we ordered. This place is literally going down the drain!!! Their restrooms are even horrible!!! How do you even past inspection??? I will not be going here ever! I do not recommend this sushi restaurant it's horrible!!!!",

    "text": "I love sushi, but my body doesn't really like all of the rice- so I try to find AYCE spots that offer riceless rolls. Unfortunately, Kaya is not one of them. However, they balance this out by offering one (5 piece) order of sashimi per person, and a grill/skewer portion of their menu, in addition to the usual apps, nigiri, and rolls. For those who love carbs, there's also a soup/noodle section available. Pricing is a bit higher, but you have quite a bit to pick from.  APPS: The sashimi plate and sashimi poke were both pretty solid, with generous portions of fish. The \"lettuce wraps\" app isn't the typical version with ground chicken and vegetables, but features crab, avocado, cucumber, and tempura veggies in lettuce cups, which is at least kind of close to a riceless roll.  GRILL/SKEWERS: We tried all of the items marked as \"one per person\" (garlic, bacon/scallop, bacon/asparagus, beef tongue, etc). We didn't really care for these items but liked having them available for something different. NIGIRI: Fresh with surprisingly thick cuts. Rice wasn't too heavy but also didn't seem to have much flavor. The salmon, halibut, and uni quality all surpassed my expectations (better than average for AYCE) but the amebi (BF's favorite) was super tiny and bland. ROLLS: We tried the White Vegas and the XXX2 rolls, the former a bit spicier than the latter, neither one especially packed with rice as we've experienced elsewhere. I'd consider coming back to try more.  I was surprised by how nice this spot was on the inside- high ceilings, cute kitschy decor, and a bar area with TV showing an NBA game. Pricing is a little higher than usual: $58 before tax/tip for dinner for two.",

It was only about 20 minutes until we were seated though, and it was well worth the wait.  We both ordered AYCE dinner ($26.99). The service was out of this world amazing and fast. We sat down, and after we browsed the menu for a bit, we ordered like 8 different rolls. I usually order a lot to start, because I know that the kitchen is usually busy and it could be some time in between orders. This was not the case here. I swear within two minutes of ordering, we had food on the table. Less than 5 minutes later, they had brought all 8 rolls. I really couldn't believe it.   The rolls were delicious. Some better than others. My favorites were the Kaya and the Million Dollar Man. The Kaya has spicy tuna, which I DO NOT LIKE, but this roll was sooo good. By the time we were done, we were stuffed and didn't have room for dessert. But they do offer various flavors of ice cream and mochi that I will be sure to get my hands on next time. Oh yeah, there will definitely be a next time. I seriously can't wait to come back here and take my friends. This place has been added to my regular sushi spot rotation!",

But my last visit we went for my birthday dinner and the hostess sat us at a booth and the whole time I thought I was going crazy because I felt water dripping on me. After we were done with our meal I noticed a little puddle of water next to my drink, we then realized the pipe above us had a leak..  My first thought was to pull the waitress aside and let her know about the problem. When I told her she said oh yea it does that and scooted the table over away from the leak!! At that point I was furious and felt disgusted about not knowing the leak was going into my food and drink.  I then asked for the manager who could've cared less he also said sorry that happens sometimes..  I don't care how good the food is, that's a health hazard and I can't believe they stay open in those conditions and to sit people there knowing about the leak is just mind blowing!  Hopefully by now they fixed it so no one else has to experience that.",

Having been here a few times previously I was eager for the rolls to start flowing.  As usually we got there right at opening to avoid the rush and crowds that typically occur here once the sushi gets going.  Our party made our way through the entrance and were seated immediately. Luck be told, this is the same table I have sat at every time dining at this location. Maybe  I can get a curtesy name plate hahahahahah. The place was very clean as usual, the staff was friendly as always, and right on top of everything. The food and drinks were out promptly, and are party of nine did not have to wait long for anything.  Nicely done staff.  For the AYCE I went with some edeme, cucumber salad, four rolls, (California, Caterpillar, Lasagna  and a Who's Your Daddy) and finished it off with some Mango Mochi.   All the rolls were tasty, but it did not seem the ingredients were as fresh as normal; which was the only negative for me this time around.   Love the ambiance, staff, and price.  As far as AYCE sushi places this is still the best I have had.  Four out of five stars as I am sure this subtle lack of freshness was just a random thing.  Will definitely be back when the sushi craving comes knocking again.",

It was cutting edge back then and in my opinion still leads the way overall in AYCE sushi. The menu has shrunk over the years but the special rolls have gotten tighter, more interesting and a lot tastier. I prefer this place to places like Yama because the rolls are small and most can be ordered 1/2. What's the point of going to an AYCE spot and getting served a giant roll you HAVE to eat? It's all about variety right? Kaya is the king of variety. The music is annoying. Really really annoying. But it's mostly a matter of my own taste. The serves sometimes ignore me, but it's forgiven as they're almost always very busy. If you want a place to start your AYCE experiences, this is it!",

Shrimp tempura roll is my personal favorite there. I must say that the only thing that's negative about the place is the size / popularity with no option to make a reservation (makes sense though because no point of holding a table while 20-50 people are waiting outside) but that results in a long wait sometimes for dinner. If you are not willing to wait AND compromise with dining time then this place is not for you. BUT! If you are willing to make some sacrifices (wait or go there when it is not busy) you get an amazing value!",

Almost made me want to throw up whilst eating the food.   My lifesaver would be the menu as I constantly used it as a fan to cool myself down every 10 min when I felt hot again.  Overall the food wasn't the best, the service was meh (too many servers and they got confused sometimes), and the establishment itself wasn't very clean. I would recommend that people who weren't \"all-for\" this place should go and try Yama Sushi that's down the street.",

    "text": "I have been to Kaya three times within the past month.  And I can give them a solid 4.5 stars each and every time.  First visit: * Steamed Pork Belly (Marinated and steamed Pork Belly with condiments) $15.95 - Comes with leaves, thinly sliced radish, sliced jalapenos, sliced garlic, kimchee, etc.  Place it altogether with a slice of pork belly and oh so yum.  Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two people! * Korean Seafood Pancake - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good. * Spicy Sashimi - Generous portion, but perhaps a bit too much.  * Something Wrong Roll - Whatever was in there, it was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece. Our waitress was super helpful and we didn't know what else to order beyond the seafood pancake.  She made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with her suggestions.      Second visit:  New addition to the menu is AYCE sushi for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri, rolls, and appetizers, we also had: * Bulgogi (steamed beef) - Generous for one, so go with one order first to see if it's something you like. * Skewers: bacon & shrimp, gingko, garlic, chicken gizzard, shrimp, beef Came for a small party and they were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a special dessert for the birthday boy and didn't complain with all the splitting of the checks.  Our waiter, Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good time.  Third visit:  AYCE sushi again! * Steamed black mussel * Ahi poki * Fried jabchae * Spicy Korean ramen * Skewers: bacon & scallop, mushroom  Service was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free beer.  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our meal more.   Their nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of fish and not a whole lot of rice.  That's pretty much what had us coming back the second time for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE menu is also what we enjoyed - especially the chicken gizzards, the garlic, bacon & scallop, shrimp, beef, etc.  Their steamed black mussels came with a creamy sauce that was good.  Soft shell crab appetizers are also available, including tempura.  Noodle dishes included are udon and ramen.  Rice dishes include fried rice, teriyaki chicken and beef bowls.  Dessert is limited to vanilla, strawberry or green tea ice cream, limit one.  For a relatively new restaurant, they are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two times we went! (From Lee's Liquor)    AYCE sushi with some Korean thrown in there?  Works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave.  They also have a frequent visitor card - Buy 10 AYCE, get 1 free!  (Pics posted!)",

It's so terrible, I can't give it any stars. The waiter was super rude and argued with me whether I ordered a roll or not. She took my sisters order and walked away and told me she would be back. My sister got her food and the waiter never came back. I had to waive her down. When asked for extra sauce and gave me attitude. The policy here is even worse. It's a buffet!!!!! Why should I be limited to what I want to order?  On top of that, I got charged for ordering too much food. There were certain food on the menu that I can only order once. I don't understand why they have it on the menu in the first place. I don't think I'll ever come back to this place ever again.",

I wouldn't come back here, there's just way too many other ayce sushi joints here in Vegas that cost the same but of higher quality.

Shrimp tempura and muscles are amazeballs and my favorite rolls are Amigo roll but I usually get it without jalapeno because Im not much of a spicy fan!

I wouldn't bring anyone here that I was trying to impress. If I am looking for decent sushi close to work this would be my go to place. :-)",

In addition to that, I got baked green mussels, and there was shell cracks IN THE MUSSELS! None of the shells were even broken so I don't even know where they came from, but it definitely hurt my teeth when I ate them.  I used to go here all the time, but not any more. Even though the servers recognized me, they still didn't discount my meal. $45 for two lunch AYCE (more like 2.5 rolls that we were able to order) and they couldn't even comp my drink. I paid it though + $0 tip.  DON'T GO HERE! Believe me, I like supporting small restaurants and not corporate chains, but this place does not deserve your patronage!",

The wait to get a table was about 40 mins or so but it was really crowded so waiting that long for a table is totally understandable. We ended up getting seated at the bar and got AYCE for about $26 each. It was phenomenal!! All of the sushi was really fresh, the workers were all nice and attentive, and the atmosphere just had a great vibe to it. I did try this one roll that I didn't particularly like. I forget what it was called but it had a kiwi sauce on it, which is pretty much the only reason why I didn't like it. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about this place!",

Normally, the service is fantastic but we got stuck with a server who did not say a lick of nice or encouraging comments to keep us satisfied. We got our order and she forgot the edamame. Once we finished, we waited 22 minutes for her to come back. She decided to take a lunch with no one to cover her tables. So that meant no refills or ordering of more rolls during that time frame. I eventually caught a busser and he sent her over. She comes over, stands in front of us and didn't say a thing. She just waited for is to talk. I usually tip very well but I was so frustrated and disappointed that we decided not to tip. I am really upset about this visit because our normal ones are usually outstanding.",

Here is how i broke this place down:  Service 4*: The girls were very good to us. They were on point when we were ordering and remembered who got what when the food came out. The food did come out pretty quick assuming that it was made upon order.  Food 3* Here is the breakdown. The rolls were the best thing on the menu.  The nigiri was decent. The wasabi tako and spicy tuna were decent.  The yakitori items were hit or miss. The bacon scallops and bacon asparagus were the top of this category. I would recommend to stay away from the beef tongue, not good at all (I like gyu tongue BTW!)  The one gripe that I have about this place is that they limit how much AYCE on certain items like the bacon scallops and the fire beef.  The serving sizes are very small so I don't think that they are taking a hit on these items. The only reason why I got more than my single ration is becasue the server thought I was dreamy ;)    One quick tip: Make reservations! We saw the same group of people sitting outside both when we arrived and left. Sucks to be them.. Be smart and call ahead...",

Also, one of the few AYCE sushi places that I know of where you can order more than one desert included in the AYCE price if you happen to have a sweet tooth.  Pros- great service and great food. Good atmosphere, a lot of people working there and many long tables/booths for large parties.  Cons- possible wait times and parking is limited, so may need to park in the next lot.",

I'm a huge salmon person so I'm pretty picky on fresh salmon and their salmon is always amazing. The sex bomb roll is definitely the best roll. They have a great variety of rolls, all which are delicious. Nigiri is always awesome, it just slides in your mouth so deliciously. The desserts are great, especially the actual ice cream. The cherry and mocha flavored ice creams are soo good! I think one of my favorite things is that they give you a stamp card for AYCE, not many places do that. You fill up your stamp card and on your 10th order, you get an Ayce lunch or dinner. Here's a tip: if you bring several friends that do AYCE as well but don't have their own stamp card, they'll give you stamps on your card counting them as well. I have filled mine up several times this way ;) service is always good and if a server hasn't came around there's also a button on your table that you can push to get your waiter to come by.  If you're going on a weekend night before 11pm, expect about an hr wait, but pretty much any other time the wait is short. =)",

I'm sure we can tell the time. Anyhow, I ordered a lemonade through three different servers and did not receive one.

    "text": "This review is mostly about the service we received. Went here around 2 pm on a Saturday with three others. We felt like our server, Julie (I believe), just did not care about the job or any of her tables. She didn't check on us once, no water refills and no smiling. We even saw her eating food on the side, and then she proceeded to come and take our order still chewing her food and talking at the same time. She also brought out an order of sushi that we did NOT order. Once we told her that it was not ours, she says \"yes it is, you ordered it\". We told her no once again, and she protested and asked if we were sure. Finally, she left and took it to the correct table. No apology or anything and completely unprofessional. Food was good as always, hence the one star. We'll be going back, but we won't sit in her section.",

Other than that everything else tasted DISGUSTING! There were no seasonings in the dishes I ordered bc there were no flavor but the gross taste of not fresh food. The mussels tasted old and dry. The tempura shrimp and squid was bad. Either the seafood was bad or the tempura batter was old. It just didn't taste right. I was surprised that I didn't get food poisoning from eating here. I ordered mochi ice cream for dessert and even that tasted horrible bc they sprinkled flour all over it but I thought it was sugar powder. So I left this place with $25 less money and loss of appetite. P.S I ate here with a hangover and the food here made me felt even worse. I should of opted for pho.",

Once they seat you they will take your drink orders right away. So no waiting on that part. We did the all you can eat and ordered a bunch of appetizers and half a roll or two! Which was more than fair since we ate more than the AYCE price. There is a line so you will have to wait for a table. Or you can always try the bar. However, it is worth the wait!!",

    "text": "Alas, my friends, it is with a heavy heart that I must demote Sushi Kaya from five stars to only two.    Since August, I have visited this establishment over 20 times, and until recently, always found the quality to be consistent.    My last 2 visits (5/1/2010 and 5/12/2010) were extremely disappointing.  As usual, my friends and I purchased the All You Can Eat sushi, and proceeded to order our favorites.  We were all in good spirits, expecting the feast that was to come - until we saw the food.   In the past, I would struggle to eat a piece of Kaya's nigiri sushi in a single bite.  The chefs cut the fish thick and broad, so that it completely covered its bed of rice.  Not anymore.  The mackerel, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri I received had been reduced to half the size, at least.  This, in of itself, is not a problem at an AYCE place.  I could overlook it as a cost-control measure, if the quality of the fish had not declined to the same pittance as the portion.  The fish was decidedly old - even a little dry in spots.  The chefs tried to cover up the worst selections with ponzu sauce.  I love ponzu, but on nigiri?  Sacrilege.     Rolls proved more palatable, if only for the multitude of ingredients drowning out the fish..  The only one that was actually delicious was the Spider Roll.  However, the sushi artistry I observed on my earlier visits was missing.   Each roll appeared sloppy on the plate, and the pieces were difficult to pick up intact.  Was the chef too hasty to give a damn about cohesion?  Was it his first day on the job?   I try not to judge too harshly, but I must also add that the avocados were inexcusable.  My avocado lover (an orb-like sculpture of shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and avocado slices) was inedible.  The avocado was so hard and under ripe,  I'm surprised it could be sliced at all.  If the avocados are so petrified that I can't poke a chopstick through a thin slice, why would a chef deign to serve it?  I'm baffled..  The worst discovery of all was the tuna.  I'm a big fan of tuna.  I *KNOW* what tuna is supposed to look and taste like.  What Sushi Kaya currently serves as tuna is decidedly ANYTHING BUT.    I don't know what it is, exactly.  My best guess is dyed tilapia.  It has the strangest shade of pink I've ever seen - like a watermelon jolly rancher.  It has almost no flavor at all, and it flakes like a white fish.  Tuna:  you're doing it wrong.  Other small gripes include the watering down of their miso soup, and an unfortunate switch from their previous brand of green tea ice cream (very flavorful and creamy, with bitter tea notes) to a new brand (bland, too sweet, may as well be vanilla).  I don't know if Kaya is cutting corners, having issues with its supplier, or both, but I don't think I'll be back for a while.    The service and ambiance is still pleasant, so it keeps a few points for style.  I knocked them down to two stars, instead of one, in hopes that the restaurant gets its act together.",

Parking can be hard to find, the wait can be up to 45 minutes when it's busy, mochi ice cream included with lunch or dinner, and service is hit and miss but usually if you get their attention, they are quick to find someone to help you.  All parties must order all you can eat to share rolls together, they give you the option to order a full or half a roll so you have the opportunity to try more, I love their roll names such as \"Who's Your Daddy\", \"Sexy Ass\" or \"Viagra\" roll to name a few, and they give you 90 minutes at the table.  This is all stated on the menu.  Yes they will charge you for leftovers so my advise, order two rolls per person in your party so that everyone can try a little bit of each roll if you don't mind sharing for round 1.  The next round, order two half rolls if you still have the stomach for more.  Anything with cream cheese and drinking water will make you full quicker.  Thankfully I have never experienced any food poisoning.  Maybe my stomach is stronger than others.  The best part about this place, they give you a card to stamp for each visit.  I had three in my party so I received three stamps at the end of our visit.  If you don't have one, simply just ask for one.",

Although I live on the NW side of town, it's still convenient given that I often drive to the inner city.   Fast & friendly customer service: I went here with my bf around 6:30 & we were seated as soon as we approached the reception desk. Food came out quickly as well since I assumed it wouldn't because the bar looked full at the time. It was our first time & the servers answered all of our questions regarding the specials & appetizers.  Creative names & nice presentation of sushi rolls: I did enjoy reading through the names & most sounded very appetizing. I would've taken pictures but at the time we were starving so it wasn't really on my mind. I would definitely return to try out more though.  Spacious & nicely decorated restaurant: I personally think their menu look should be updated, to suit the restaurant's authentic environment. High ceilings with traditional Japanese decorations were really nice to look at. Compared to other sushi restaurants I've been to, the amount of space between the tables is more than enough to not burst your personal bubble.   So 5 stars for everything except for the parking lot, but that's Chinatown, right?",

Our server walked by 3 times seeing our empty table during lunch and never once stopped. We had to ask the hostess to get our server so we could order more food. The manager (who I believed is the manager) came by and took our order and told us that any server can take our order. Well.... Lady, You also saw our table empty a bunch of times with dirty plates and not once stopped to bus or ask if we wished for more food. Get your service staff together and fast.",

The only downside I saw was that their sushi menu only has one real vegetarian option, the \"Shrek Roll\", and that roll contains salsa and cilantro. They could have come up with a few more vegetarian rolls. However, everything else was fantastic and I'm definitely looking forward to coming here again.",

After almost an hour I went to check up on my time, management at first said another 5 to 10 minutes, to then be told by the host that it would be another half hour at the earliest!!!! Wtf kind of management is going on? Had they told me the wait would be 1 1/2 to 2 hours from the beginning we would have ate elsewhere. Place has great sushi but is not prepared to receive a lot of guest, do not go to this place on a holiday, especially not Valentine's lol as it is a very small restaurant.",

Came here for late night AYCE sushi last night with my Vegas yelp friends Nelson S and Will F  I had a few AYCE sushi experiences here in Vegas over the past 2 months and I have to say... I wasn't very amused.  First off... I really wanted seaweed salad and they were out. No mochi ice cream :( and the ahi poke was horrible! The quality of fish was very low.  Sexy roll, tempura crunch roll, seared ahi nigiri and tamago was okay.  They did ask us to clean all of our plates... so be careful when ordering! Service was decent.  I wouldn't go back.  2 stars for good location and late night hours.  Casual dining. Indoor seating only.  NEXT! :((",

The food is really good and my favorite roll is the sex bomb. The menu is very large with so many choices and they have a lot of fun rolls with unique flavors in them. When we go as a group we order half the menu and it's fun to try a bunch of different items.   I'm new to sushi so I'm still experimenting but I like mostly everything except for some of the raw choices like spicy tuna that is too mushy for me.   Dessert here is also great with my favorite ice cream the almond mocha!!!!!!! Yummy!!!!!!!!",

Unfortunately I feel the need to take away a star for a few reasons. One the menu change. There are a few items on the menu that have changed that I would have preferred not but I understand switching things up. On the menu of course. What I don't like is the price increase and now I won't be able to go as much or be able to recommend for low prices anymore. And they've also changed their opening time to 11:30 instead of 11:00 which isn't a huge difference but still a difference. Would still recommend though for the amazing sushi! :)",

My friend was so crazy about this place, and begged me to give it another shot, but I refused.  I hadn't been back until last night.    I was definitely wrong about the place, or they have made some huge changes and improved greatly.  Their AYCE is affordable, and they have a lot of things on the menu that I don't think other AYCE places offer.    We had AYCE and devoured several items:  Brooklyn Bridge (I'm not a fan of eel, but loved this anyway!)  Shrek Roll (my favorite of the rolls that I was able to sample)  Soft Shell Crab roll with Soy Paper (Good, but wasn't blown away)  California Roll (Can't go wrong!)  3 orders of Sake Nigiri + avocado (yum, fresh and delicious)  3 orders of Hamachi Nigiri + avocado (same as above)  Poki (Good, I've had better elsewhere, but it wasn't bad) Ginger Salad (delicious and refreshing)  Mini Cheesecake dessert (I loved it!)   Probably the only thing that I can actually complain about, is that their iced tea wasn't that great.    I will be back, I'm a fan now!",

The surprising part of this quality place is that they have AYCE. Most AYCE places reserve only the cheaper slices or they load the orders up with rice. SK didn't have a crazy amount of rice with the sushi, so you're ok there. Sure, there are restrictions on the quantity on some of the good stuff, but that's to be understood. Just know that it's tasty and the fish is fresh.  I did have to take a star off because the service wasn't consistent, even in the same visit. Not a deal breaker, but still worth noting.",

I didn't try it because I was a chicken butt. Oh jalapeno poppers were delicious and they used Japanese jalapenos which are a tad spicy! My aunt and uncle ordered everything so I don't know what I ate exactly. But I do know that their Ono nigiri and the Jose roll left me a good memory of sushi kaya!   Mocha ice cream was yums!

    "text": "If I ever stopped caring about my health, I'll for sure frequent sushi buffets.  I mean, who doesn't love sushi buffets?  For about $20+, you can eat all the sushi, sashimi, and fried seafood your damaged heart can handle.  Sushi Kaya is one of those buffets that'll do it's best to make sure you leave with your money's worth.  Located in Chinatown, Sushi Kaya is a bit hard to find.  If I remember correctly, it seemed Sushi Kaya and all the buildings around it use the same, if not similar, font.  But once you find it, get ready to eat a plethora of sushi.  We had a group of about 16 people for a bachelor party.  They seated us in this room that was next to the front entrance.  I think they seated us here because they knew we were trouble, so they would want to shuffle us out of the restaurant ASAP.  The room was spacious, had comfortable couches, and was set-up with non-working speakers.  Ah yeah, we were giving them hell about the speakers.  They were playing good music in the restaurant, but our room wasn't playing any of the music.  We decided to improvise by putting an iPhone in a cup and see if the sound would amplify and be loud enough for all of us to hear.  Yeah, we're idiots.  Anyways, the menu had a huge selection of different sushi, sashimi, and other delightful items.  All of us ordered 2-3 dishes because we knew it would take a while for them to make and bring in our order.  By the way, you have about 90 minutes to destroy their supply of seafood.  So, you better make every minute count.  I ordered the Spider roll, Eel roll, Caterpillar roll, and then it became fuzzy after that because I think I ordered more beers than food.  Yeah, they brought the liquor faster than the food.  Can't complain!  Oh yeah, they have a Jose roll.  My Mexican friend thought it was only fitting that he ordered it.  He said it was ,\"Muy bien!\"  But yeah, my food was pretty good.  The fish tasted fresh, the rice didn't taste bad, the rolls weren't too saucy, and they gave us decent portions for each roll.  The staff-- man.  First, if any of the waiters and waitresses are reading this:  WE ARE SO SORRY FOR MAKING YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL FOR THE 90 MINUTES WE WERE THERE.  Alcohol + 16 guys + No girlfriends/wives to keep us in check = Rebecca Black's Friday.  Wut?  Seriously, thank you staff for being super friendly, cracking jokes with us, and taking the verbal gibberish the drunk bachelor threw at you guys.  Sushi Kaya. thank you very much for serving us.  I hope the night you spent with us will forever be branded in your brains.  It was one of many fun times we had in Vegas.  Thanks so much!!!!  Until next time...*evil laughter*",

I've probably used up 5 stamp cards because I go here so often. LOL   I highly recommend the Cinderella Roll, Brooklyn Bridge & Japanese lasagna roll. I also love their nigiri. Amaebi, yellowtail, & salmon are my faves! Their appetizers are also delicious. Bbq beef skewers, beef tongue, bacon wrapped asparagus, baked green mussels, kimchi fried rice, omg I can go on & on. Oh, don't forget dessert! I like how they don't have a *one order per person* limit on desserts so you can order to your heart's content. I usually order the red bean ice cream & green tea mochi. I'm obsessed with their red bean ice cream!   The only downside is the wait times for this place (usually a 30-45 min wait on the weekends) since it's ALWAYS packed & the parking lot is as well since it's right by other popular restaurants such as Tea Station & Ichiza. Ugh, I wish they would expand their parking lot. However, the quality of the food here outweighs the wait times & parking situation.   Definitely check out this place. :)",

Definitely a clean place and worth visiting again and again. Ask for the regulars card, they stamp it for you so after 10 times you eat 1 time free",

I didn't receive more than half of what I ordered and the other part of the group didn't get ANY food for 45 minutes and had to watch the other half eat.  Kaya needs to understand how to take orders for a big group.  When I asked for my other half of my order the guy said \" oh, it's not coming I don't know what happened to it.\"  Really?  He comped the people that waited their beers but made no effort to give us our full orders. The sushi wasn't even worth the trouble.  I had Tako Nigiri, seaweed salad, sex bomb roll and a beer. 1/3 of what I normally eat at an AYCE and I paid $40 for a meal that didn't fill me at all.....  I understand that we were a big group so there will be mistakes but when 70% of everyone's orders didn't even come out, that's just not even trying. I'll never come back and neither will the other 13-14 people.  You lost a lot of customers today Kaya.  That's unfortunate.",

The service was excellent. The waitress was dressed in a cute school girl outfit and stockings. (if your into the asian young girl look here is your girl) She was friendly, fast and al around great. They kept our plates coming and our area clear of empty place. Drinks kept being refilled and they were great at explaining different dishes to my out of town guests.   They kept my little one year old occupied with a little paper menu but no crayons. oh well no biggie. Thye let me share my food with no extra charge which really surprised me. Last but not least tey played with her. Poking her, tickling, talking and lastly waving whenever they went bye. tooooo cute! kid friendly place is the place to be for me ;)  The food was good. Huge sizes so becareful when you order because if you dont finish an item they charge you. I really like tat because then that means they dont waste food and are great with food costs.  Best part about this place was that they have a rewards card system for how often you come. Awesomeness. If i remember correctly the 9th AYCE meal is FREE  Best Dishes IMO;  - who's your daddy. (hilarious name. delicious dish. tastes nothing like sushi. sooo good that i had to order it about 2 or 3 times)  - shrimp tempura & the vege tempura. (lightly fried, the veggies could ahve been a little fresher but maybe it was just me. the shrimp were a lot larger than i expected)  - the teriyaki bowl (its huge so becareful when you order it. It filled me up a lot so I wish that in the end it was smaller. The meat was seasoned well, not too much sweet sauce on it. More rice than i wanted.)  - moochie (very good, ive had better green tea but it would do)  - the cheesecake (the best!! omg every time it was different. they give you a mound of whip cream next to the cheesecake bites, sprinkled with syrup. The first bite was cookie cheesecake. The second was strawberry cheesecake and the third was just plain old cheesecake. All were very  good and i wished i could have ordered more but there was a limit. darn!!)",

    "text": "One of the BEST sushi buffet that I have ever had!  To me it is the variety and the taste/quality of the food that sets it apart from the other buffets.  Back and front of menu with LOTS of options to eat.  The food you get are not \"buffet\" taste, i.e. bland or stuffed with crap, it was pretty much what you expect to get at a decent sushi restaurant, with the addition of korean dishes.  When you hear of All You Can Eat Sushi, I bet you think of 5 rolls, 5 nigiris, 3 appetizers, green tea ice cream - ALL tasting hella nasty, huh?  Well, you won't find none of that crap here.  True the sign says \"All You Can Eat Sushi\", but they serve way more than just sushi.  They serve lots of korean dishes also - japchae, bulgogi, \"punkin gongee\" (think it should be pumpkin congee), etc.  I think the items that you should really try are the skewers (they have bacon wrapped scallop, bacon wrapped shrimp, shrimp, beef, \"galic\" (garlic), sweet potato, mushroom, and more!!).  All were good, but the best to me has to be the beef and sweet potato.  There must be a reason why they limit this to only one per person right?  The sushi rolls were of decent quality and size, not like the rolls of lots of imitation crap, I mean crab, and rice to stuff you full.  Compared to True sushi restaurants it was be in the middle of the pack, but compared to buffets it is at the top.  Who serves good tasting rolls at a buffet??  No one usally, except for Kaya.  (Hooray!)  The fish used on the nigiri were cut quite thin and not of the best quality, but very edible and tasty.  What do you expect from a buffet?  The rolls are presented well on the plates and are pretty much very tasty.  Menu says each roll costs $12.95 if ordered separate, so eat up boys and girls and make it worth your money!!  They only have strawberry, vanilla, and green tea ice cream for dessert.  You will be stuffed by trying one of each skewer, many nigiris and rolls, bulgogi, japchae, etc. to be thinking of more dessert than a scoop of ice cream.  They only limit it to one scoop of one kind per person.  Mixed review on this.  =/  Went here at midnight and it was pretty full still.  The atmosphere was cool.  Mix of korean/hip hop songs and the customers being loud and having fun.  The people (customers and waiters) were korean, the special menu items on wall were in korean, the music was korean, some menus was in korean.  The food was good, the music was good, the service was good - what more can you ask for?!?  Food was good for an all you can eat buffet. Service was good and attentive - always asking if there is anything else we would like.  Maybe one more star added if they took off the restrictions on the skewers and ice cream.  =P  Will I be back??  HELL YEAH!!  I would take this any day over buffets at any of the hotels on the strip.",

The selection is crazy for AYCE and it is definilty a place to eat some rolls and nigiri for a great price.  I ate a sashimi plate that had some of the highest quality fresh fish I have had in Las Vegas.  A for the quality.   The service was OK- not the nicest people in the world and I'm always put off a bit when not so nice people work at sushi places.  C for the service  The worst part about this place is the music.

    "text": "I went here with my dad because it is one of the more affordable AYCE places in town that does not sacrifice quality to be cheaper. They open at 11:30am and stay open until 3am. Lunch starts right at 11:30am and goes until 4pm for 19.95. Dinner is from 4pm until last call at 2am for 22.95. It is a great deal that includes a few special items and a large selection of rolls.  The best deals when it comes to appetizers were the lightly battered soft shell crab in a ponzu sauce, the ahi poke, the oysters on a half shell, and the baked green mussels. Even if you eat a few orders of these, you would easily cover the price for AYCE.  The nigiri was delicious as well. Yes, the fish slices were slightly smaller but the amount of rice that they use matched well. You do not feel like this place is trying to scam you by filling you up with rice. We ordered halibut, yellowtail, albacore, spicy scallop, unagi, and shrimp. Halibut is my favorite fish, so I could eat that all day. I normally detest yellowtail with a passion, but I enjoyed it here. It was not overly fishy and was pleasant.  The rolls, I find them to be nothing really special. Although they have a whole page dedicated to regular and specialty rolls, I found it hard to find ones that were imaginative or new. We ended up ordering a tiger, caterpillar, and another roll that escapes my mind right now. As you can see the rolls are nothing to write home about. It is better to just order the nigiri. I probably would have loved the roll menu more if I was not trying to avoid the tempura and cream cheese that littered most rolls. Don't get me wrong, their tempura is good, but I cannot justify eating all this rice and fried foods as well. I just wanted slabs of raw fish.  The service is not the best, but after going to a few Japanese places I am used to being ignored (::cough:: Shuseki ::cough::), so this was much better. Even though the server was busy she made it a point to ask if we were doing alright, refilled our drinks, took our additional orders.  This place is a nice fusion of Japanese-Korean food, service, and culture. It felt comfortable sitting at the bar listening to K-Pop that was not blaring in you ear.",

    "text": "Came here after reading Chris M's review of the AYCE option. The place seemed somewhat busy, but the sushi bar was wide open.    The AYCE menu is pretty extensive.  The usual nigiri options are available.  In addition, there is a list of a rolls, appetizers (korean and japanese), robata, noodles, soups, and rice dishes. The size of fish on the nigiri is on the smaller side, but the amount of rice is proportionally less too so that's nice. There are limits to certain types of items: uni, amaebi, all robata, oysters, etc. Everything tasted fine, I especially like the kim chi fried rice I am ashamed to say.  A lot fo the rolls have cream cheese, which was a bit of a turn off. Certain rolls can also be ordered in half orders so you can try a little more variety.   The biggest headache eating at this restaurant is the difficulty in placing your orders.  The waitresses were incredibly busy, thank goodness one of them is a friend of mine, or else I might have starved. The sushi chefs are the worst however.  At most sushi restaurants they will ask you if you want anything or if you are ready for more.  Here, when they have no rolls or sushi to make, they just stand around talking to each other. You have to flag them down and place an order. As for value, $20 for lunch and about  $25 for dinner is a pretty good deal.  If the sushi chefs could be a little more proactive, this place would definitely get four stars.",

    "text": "Ok, whoever told you that this place wasn't worth checking out.....smack them right now! This place is by far the best sushi I've ever encountered in Vegas, and that my friend is no lie. (All right let me not say best, since I'm always on the search for the best. Let's see the best by far) Not only is their sushi amazing, but so is their interior decorating. It's a little crowded at times, and all the songs they play are in a language I don't quite understand, but the food is worth the trip!   The only reason I didn't give this a five is because of their service. But hey, any shop owned by an Asian staff that speaks less than 80% English, hey your bound to run into bad service. Ok, if you can put up with the minor \"rudeness\" then you'll experience delicious!  Our group of friends came out her on a little experience, after hearing mixed reviews about this place I decided to check this out any way. The price is good for AYCE, compared to sushimon which is almost $30 for dinner.  I gave a quick glance their menu and decided to stick to the appetizers and nigiri for sushi.   Ohhhhh boy, we ordered:  White Tuna Nigiri: OMG! The most tender and fresh piece of fish ever! It was like having a burst of flavors melt in your mouth. It felt like an exotic rush, idk what it is but I feel like raw fish is exotic. Weird right?  Seared Albercore Nigiri: OMFG!!! Another melt in your mouth sushi, idk what it is but it just tantalizes my tongue, always saying give me more!  Yellowtail Nigiri: Also a definite must! It's sooooo fresh, everything just meshes well together.  Bacon and scallop Skewer: I find their rule a little greedy, seeing you only get one skewer per person. And with the smallest strip of bacon on tiny ass scallop, you've got be kidding me that I'm only limited to one? Well, whatever.....the taste of the skewer is amazing. The juices of the scallop burst out if your mouth along with the bacon. It's so sad that's it's tiny as heck.  Shrimp Skewer: again, tiny as heck but deliciously oozing with so muCh flavor. Whoever came up with their skewer rule was cruel. Leaving a person with something amazing, with a limit.  Oysters: I was never a fan of raw oysters, somi was a bit surprised when I got it. I was under the impression that it was baked, but I should've known. You don't come to a sushi place, expecting to get something cooked.  Salmon Skin roll: It was surprisingly good, I usually get a hand roll, but I was surprised with the consistency of the rice. Not too sticky or wet, just right...with the right amount of stuffing.  Calamari: Fried to a crisp served with the special soy sauce, served on a fancy looking bento box. Nothing amazing, but worth the try.  Spicy Rice cake: More like seet and sour rice cake, interesting but nothing special.  Green tea Ice cream: sweet, but not green tea tasting. I'm sad that they didn't have fried tempura ice-cream. Ohh well, there's always room for improvement.  This is good sushi joint and worth the pit-stop. Get there before 7 if you're coming in for dinner. It gets pretty packed.",

Seats were open but we were told 20-30 minutes for any seat and the lady just before of us was told 15... We were waiting and saw 3 more seats open at the bar and we were the only party waiting at this point. My friend went and asked if we could again sit at the bar. She seemed annoyed and rudely sat us at the Bar. My one complaint about the bar is you don't get to interact with the Sushi Chef's  and you can't really see what they are doing. We had a great waitress most of the service until towards the end. We then had a very solemn male server who no joke,  aggressively yanked my cup from my hand for a refill. He made all 3 of us feel like were inconveniencing him. Food Spot On but again service is what caused the point deduction.",

They have a lot to offer on the menu from appetizers, rolls, nigiri, and even dessert.    There's just too many to choose from and hard to decide on what we wanted to eat.  We just ordered a whole bunch of rolls and nigiri and started to eat away.  We got through 3 rounds of ordering and that was it.  I had bacon wrapped scallops, gyoza, calamari tempura, baked mussels, baked scallop roll, some kind of dynamite roll, and a tempura roll.  They had a bunch of nigiri and two types of soup.    It was really filling and yes you have to eat everything or else they will charge you extra.  20 dollars for ayce is not bad. I like this ayce sushi because you get to order and they bring it to you vs. other ayce sushi that are buffet style.  This place is definitely a hit or miss for people.  I can see both sides.  However, it's not bad at all for the price.",

We ordered 5 rolls and didn't finish one. All of them has extra gooey rice old fish which tasted bland. It all made my stomach hurt and made me super nauseous.  The worse part of the meal was the rude manager who told me that nothing was wrong and that no one else has compliant. He didn't even get out of his way to me the customer better or anything. Definitely stay away from this place!!!",

I've frequented over 20 sushi joints in the Vegas valley and this is still one of my all time favorites.  First, they are open late, and by late...3am is awesome for those late night sushi cravings.  Second, 21.95 for dinner just can't be beat!  I actually like that they serve soda in cans and the price includes free refills.  They have a wide selection of flavored saki's and a decent beer selection.   The food is just awesome.  Generous sizes of fish slices for nigiri, the rolls are hands down the best I've had, and they have a huge selection of appetizers including skewers.  The service has always been top notch in the numerous times I've visited.  One of the managers always comes up to me and lets me know that it's nice to see us again and asks how the service was when we are getting ready to leave.    You can't go wrong with this place.

They have some of the freshest sushi and every item they sale holds its own. There Meso soup which is very inexpensive (party bonus) is fabulous, they have terrific rolls, and even the appetizers are great.    As far as the all you can eat menu, I have had it once and although it was good I found that I enjoy more off the regular menu than on sushi one. Then again I am not very explorative with raw fish so that could have a lot to do with it. The price per person for the all you can eat sushi is $19.95 for Lunch and $22.95 for dinner. You have an hour to order but when we went we stayed for longer than that and they still let us order as much as we wanted.   I have been back at least a dozen times and have managed to try their different noodle dishes and other menu items and have been impressed thus far. I have yet to get something I did not think was great tasting.  Other than that, always check out the specials! They had california rolls on sale for a dollar for a month. I was sad to see the price raise back up to $4.95 but still love it the same.",

We came across the huge sign that said \"AYCE\" sushi outside of Kaya.  Without hesitation, my family all agreed on this place.  It was nice the day we came... the place was not too busy to serve my large family.  We were seated quickly and we ordered our way with sushi.  Each person could only get one order of uni , soft shell crabs, oysters and the skewer (I wish they would let us order more of the skewer).  The sushi were okay.... not the freshest we had, but it was still good.  But we did notice the sizes were pretty small... that was okay since small sushi = small amount of rice.  We just had to order more... it's ayce...  Besides from the sushi, we ordered cucumber salad (not that good), pumpkin porridge (great), udon (real yummy) and many more....  The only real complaint I had was that some of the items we ordered never came.  We had to keep following up with our orders and re-ordered and re-ordered until we kind of didn't know what came and what didn't.  Besides from that, it was a good experience for us.",

The sushi is good but the service here is not as good as the food. Ate here a couple days ago w/ my family & they were constantly forgetting to bring rolls to our table. We had to ask 3 times for our Ever Green roll which doesn't even have any meat in it just all veggies so I'm confused as to why that took so long. Other times I've had a waiter take 15 mins to take another order. Pretty annoying since I was at a table right in front of the sushi bar. Besides that food is good & I recommend getting a stamp card cause you get a free AYCE after your 10th one.",

I understand that it gets extremely busy during the weekends and usually we have to wait over an hour for a table which used to be worth it but this visit ruined everything. First off, we waited over 2 hours but this time I got very frustrated bc they kept passing people that arrived way after us so I went up to speak to the hostess only to find out that she claimed to have called my name a long time ago when clearly my bf and I were standing right next to the hostess podium the entire time and then told us that shed give us the next available table so we waited for about another 20 mins as she kept sitting other people so my boyfriend went up to ask again and they finally sat us, we looked at the menu and a lady came to ask us for our drinks (which she later forgot about them so we had to ask another server again) first round was good, here came second round.. We waited for about 10 mins until someone approached us, same thing happened with 3rd round, even when it's busy they usually attend us quickly but not this time. unfortunately,  we will have to search for another sushi bar.",

We got seated in about 20 mins of waiting at first I thought I was going to have a good time we got the first order in and it came except for two of our noodles we ordered after the first order we never saw our waiter again... Like literally they forgot about our table we had no refills we had to ask someone and he gave us a stink face (waiter with glasses) so he sent he busser of course to do it. The busser I have to say was the best out of everything. We waited and waited and still our noodles never came our waiter never came AGAIN I asked for help and told the girl that if we had a waiter that we wanted to order another while went by. I was just too mad to even order anything else so the manager came and gave us the tab he was so fast at that let me tell you! We told him about the bad experience and all he had to say for it is \"We Are Busy\" who says that! Everyone else was getting taken care of ! And other then that he got mad because we didn't tip our 'server' what freaking server because as far as I know we didn't have one!!! So I tipped the busser who refilled our drinks! Because I thought that would be the best. We walked out and I found it SOOOO rude that the manager laughed at us. WHO DOES THAT this place is horrible. The management is horrible and if he's the owner then shame on him and if he's not I hope the owner realizes that he has the wrong people for the \"management\" role he's suppose to be a problem solver not laugh at people's faces totally regret my first review from here lost some very frequent customers and be sure we will let people know about this place ha.

Yes, they do offer Uni, and yes, it's obviously not as good as what you'd get at a traditional joint, but AYCE with an entire menu isn't bad at all.   The service was excellent. We had a big table (actually took up the entire Karaoke room. Yep, they've got one!) and there were two waitresses attentively serving us.   The tuna was fairly dry, but the yellowtail and salmon were both excellent in AYCE quality. It's Korean-owned, so they have some Korean plates to offer as well, on an AYCE basis. The one thing that stood out was the Duk bok gi. It was pretty damned good!

I went for dinner last night and it was a chilly and rainy night so the restaurant was not as crowded as other Yelp reviewers have reported.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting and the two hostesses, wait staff and chefs all made me feel welcomed.  The menu is a mix of traditional and American sushi, all in a good way.  But what I want to report is that the sushi chefs know how to respect the fish.  Its temperature is not refrigerator cold so you can actually taste the flavor of the fish.  The same is True of the rice that you can tell was recently prepared and fluffed.  I don't enjoy old rice that is packed like mortar.   The last thing I want to note is that for many of the rolls you can order a half roll.  This is great if you want to try several rolls and don't want to fill up on a few.  Sushi Kaya offers a loyalty card so after repeat visits you earn a free AYCE.  Nice but not necessary, this is one sushi restaurant I WILL return to and enjoy more great sushi to get my fix.    For a dinner price of $24.95, at Sushi Kaya you get more than you paid for as compared to many other valley sushi restaurants.",

I hope they get rid of their staff that sucks, not all of them. But the ones they do, the manager with the new balances, with the attitude, and the waitress that is too slow to be an average human being. I apologize, but this place should realize that people come in here often, and the fact that they don't makes me want to start going to Blue Fin. Thank you so much, but Kaya is trash. Anyone that doesn't agree, has never been here more than once a week. Good bye and good day.",

Had to wait about 20 minutes, but that's to be expected at a buffet. Losing one star because we called hours ahead to make a reservation and they said they didn't do reservations before 10 pm. Got there around 930 pm and had to wait...but saw a table marked \"Reserved\" as soon as we walked in. Aside from that, Service was quick, food started coming out about 5 mins after ordering.  Everything was delicious. Not the absolute best sushi I've ever had, but this place did not disappoint. Lots of variety on the menu. Would definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "Went to Kaya with my roommate, since she said the food was good the last time she went with her friends.  We arrived about 7:15pm on a Friday night, and the place wasn't too crowded and the service was good.  We ordered some nigri sushi and some of the skewers (bacon wrapped scallops - decent; beef tongue - under-seasoned, disappointed).  Most of the fish are good, but some were not too fresh.    Also tried the Sweety Roll (based on previous Yelp review) and was really disappointed at how this tempura-style roll turned out to be.  The roll is big, but also filled with mostly rice.  The eel sauce it was dressed with tasted burnt=bitter, which is mostly not how eel sauce is supposed to taste like here normally.  Also tried the Rock & Roll (which the waiter said was a cucumber wrapped roll without rice) served with a kiwi sauce.  When the roll arrived, I can clearly see that whoever prepared it was no experienced sushi master or even someone with a decent knife skill (cucumber slice was uneven and on the thick side). The roll is also wrapped in seaweed with lots of rice and the fish described in the menu, which is then wrapped in the thick cucumber sheet. The kiwi sauce was okay, most likely made by blending mayo + some kiwi + sugar, which I thought was interesting to try, but nothing to write home to rave about.  Service from the waitstaff also suffered once we have been there for about 30 minutes, since there were a few groups of 5 or 6 that arrived. It was difficult to place new orders, get refills on our beverages, until additional waitstaff stepped in to help out.  Overall, I would say that it is a decent AYCE sushi experience for the $29 (incl tax and tip, no other beverages).  But if you go, stick to their nigiri and appetizer menu.  The special rolls sounds good on paper, but falls short on taste and execution. Also sit at the sushi bar if you can, so you can at least ask the sushi chefs what fish is fresh and what you should avoid.",

    "text": "Came here bc there was an HOUR wait at ichiza.. There was a 30 min wait here. First off, waiting area is SMALL! And also it's right by the entrance so if there is a party waiting you have to slither your way through the crowd to put your name down and then slither your way back out. :/   Me n 4 others were here for the AYCE dinner which is $25/person. Their menu is far different from a lot of Sushi buffets. They have a wide selection of appetizers from beef tongue (yum!) to gizzards (yummm!) to deep fried jalapeno poppers (yummmmmm!). They have a good amount of nigiris including uni & amaebi! Even though I'm not a fan of either, these were some of the perks since I know these items are pricey at regular sushi joints. They have a good selections of rolls (sex bomb is scrumptious) as well as hot food like udon, japchae, kimchi fried rice, etc. Even for dessert they have a couple diff things (cheesecake, mochi, ice cream). I'm used to the reg jap buffet and their infamous ice cream cones.   Customer service was prob one of the best. Waiters/tresses were very attentive and we were able to order from anybody that came to our table, not just our server. Food came out in decent timing.   The only downside is that it's a buffet but it's limited. Your max order for one item is same as the number of heads at your table so... If you have a party of five, you can only order 5 orders of uni. Even though this didn't present a problem for my party, I can see where this could be an issue if everybody loved uni and they were only limited to one order of it.",

I was telling a busser if we could order more and listed off some food and she completely cut me off and just said I'll get your server (at least say sorry I can't take your order, but I'll get your server). I asked my server for a refill and he just gave me a finger to wait. At the end of the meal the server did not offer any dessert at all, he was just quick to give the check. My friend found a hair in his ice cream and was disgusted.  We tipped them just to be considerate, but in all honesty they did not deserve a tip at all in my books. I suggest everyone to go to Oyshi or Goyemon for AYCE sushi!   DEFINITELY WILL NOT RETURN!",

The menu also informs you that if you don't finish your sushi (including the rice), they'll charge you for the whole roll. That kinda annoyed me but we were able to finish it thanks to having guys with us haha.   With that 22.95 rate, you can order anything you want from a lengthy menu that includes skewers, dessert (ice cream), nigiris, and specialty rolls and more.

Upon entering, my boyfriend and I were happily greeted by the employees, and seated at a nice sized table.   Upon first glance, the menu seemed similar to places like Yama, with a lot of roll and nigiri options. In addition to those, they had skewers, appetizers, and desserts as well. After we had received our first order, the service kind of slowed down for us. In their defense they were kind of busy, but after waiting for what felt like 15 minutes to give our next order, it kind of started to annoy me.   As for the sushi.. The nigiri tasted fresh, but was a lot smaller in comparison to what I've received at other restaurants like Goyemon or Yama. This can be a good or bad thing depending on what type of sushi eater you are. I eat mainly nigiri, since rolls aren't really my thing, so I prefer more substantial sized pieces. I do recommend you try the cajun albacore though, you won't regret it!  Sushi Kaya is a good AYCE option here in Vegas.. it's just not the best.",

Thankfully, my friends hate uni so I used all of their orders for it :) the service was really good that day & the place wasn't crowded at all. It is a bit far from where I live, but if I'm ever in the area I will definitely consider this place.",

Did the all you can eat so we could sample everything in the menu.  I love that they will do half rolls on most orders. That way we were able to try a lot of different rolls.   Started with some appetizers. I had a cucumber salad and she had the lettuce wrap!  Moved on to a Ryan roll, Jupiter roll, Brooklyn bridge, mango (spicy one ) loved it.  Finished off with a cheesecake dessert and a Mochi mango ice cream.   Overall,  Food? Amazing!!!  Service? Top knotch!! Atmosphere? Fast paced but you get all the attention you need for anything.

He then refused to give our friends a stamp card and insisted he gave everyone a stamp (he did not). I always gave this place five stars for the service.   You need to be careful who manages your restaurant. You lost a good manager and now we are stuck with this guy who has no manners or management skills.

I always have skepticism when it comes to eating Seafood, especially raw fish in a city that isn't right next to the ocean. I forget food can get sent anywhere.   Came with a party of 12 during dinner on a Saturday with no reservations. We lucked out because the private room was just leaving and we didn't even have to wait! Ordered a gazillion Nigiris, special rolls, tempura, skewers, soft shell crab, poke, appetizers all on the first run. The waiter was so good, didn't even miss a beat and got us all our food super quick. We could barely keep up as the Nigiris kept coming. The sweet shrimp, uni, yellowtail, ono, scallop, salmon and albacore tuna were not bad! Especially the uni, I usually hate uni because it has this weird lingering taste but this uni was mildly sweet and tasted fresh.   This was like Man vs. Food and I'm embarrassed to admit that we tapped out after the 2nd round. Food always win. I managed to stuff 2 mochis at the end. Yum!!",

I had to finally flag down a waitress and she acted like she had no idea what was going on. Hi, I'm a guest at your restaurant and I would like for you to take my order. Still confused? Since I figured I would be forgotten about again after our drinks came, I immediately took this opportunity to put in my order for AYCE.  The first round of sushi came up one item short. When I asked if it was coming I was told that it should be on it's way... After another ten minutes I ask again and this time she says she has to put in the order again for the missing item. Gr8.   After I got the missing item and I finished everything in the first round, I'm ready for round two but unfortunately our waitress didn't feel the need to come back to our table for another 20 minutes after we finished. I tried staring her down to get her attention but she would not even look over to the direction if our table! Ever! Like wtf isn't the waitresses job to make sure her tables are doing okay? She never came over and asked once. Finally when I got her attention I ordered a second round and guess what? This time TWO items were missing. Where is my sushi? I waited and waited and it never came out so I again flagged down the waitress since she was ignoring the table and she said she would check on it. She came back to say the ticket was lost and she would have to put in the order again. GR88888!!!! How hard is it to put in a ticket and pick up the sushi from the bar and bring it to the table in a timely manner? Apparently very hard.   This was my third and final time trying Kaya. Each experience has been worse than the last so I'm going to stop coming here. I tried to give you a second and third chance but you blew it! :(  Only giving two stars because I ate all the sushi and although it wasn't the best, I still enjoyed the food :) NOT the service!",

Yuri if you ever see this, me and my boys ate here last week around the time you guys were getting ready to close. We were sitting at the table closest to the cash register, 4 very tatted white guys...you told us how you were originally from San Francisco and the reason why you thought we got along so well was because we're both not from here and that people from Vegas grew up breathing different air lol. Not only was she very attentive, she had an amazing sense of humor and was cracking jokes with us all night. She was a blast, if you guys ever get the chance ask to be seated in Yuri's section. You won't regret it. She's the gorgeous Asian waitress with a septum nose ring, which my homies and I thought she pulled off better than any other chick out there. Awesome girl, super friendly and bubbly.   Sexbomb, cowboy, and jose were my favorite rolls. we asked Yuri what was her favorite and her answer was \"anything deep-fried. life is better deep-fried\"   Definitely recommend this place!",

They are frequent sushi eaters and said it was some of the best they ever had! I couldn't complain I had the sexy roll and I thought it was awesome.. the cilantro sauce was pretty good too. Great service the bussers helped out as much as our own waitress!",

    "text": "In addition to my bad review for Kaya, a shocking discovery was made when I checked out my bank statement. Kaya was not only slow during our lunch hour visit, forgotten an item, served frozen lemons with our waters, they actually managed to charge twice on my credit card and didn't charge my friend's credit card. Seriously!!?? How confusing is a Wells Fargo credit card versus a Bank of America Credit card!! She had 3 tables in the whole restaurant, during our meal (should I even call it a meal?). Apparently to the Kaya server, it is as confusing as black and white.  Willful stupidity absolutely makes me livid!  So, I phoned the manager and asked to be credited ASAP. She talked me into coming down and accepting cash for the duplicate charge.  After patiently waiting for 15 minutes inside the restaurant, I began feeling strangulated because of strong emotion that reminded me of my horrible eating experience!   Additionally, the manager had the nerve to ask for my friend's contact information so she can properly charge him on his credit card! The frozen lemons, welted vegetables and rancid sushi must have gotten to her crazy head!  Gracefully grabbing my cash from her hand, my look of despair and silence concluded her query!!   One great thing out of this is that my out of town friend had a free horrible lunch which I don't mind paying for....",

    "text": "DISRESPECTFUL, HORRIBLE SERVICE. Do not waste your money and time here.  My bf and I went here to have a late night dinner together after a long days work. Ichiza was busy so we decided to come and try this place out. We got seated and our server jayden came by to get our drink order. After he got out drinks, we proceeded to make an order to do the all you can eat. We informed him of both our food allergies which for him is shellfish and mine is capsaicin. When he first heard this he laughed at us. We asked him to make sure that nothing we get has shellfish or peppers. He told us he would make sure but we have to read the description on the menu too. We agreed to that. We got our first order in and our salmon skin salad had chili In it. We sent it back and this server gladly took it back. Note that this dining experience we probably had to talk to 5 different people. When we were ready to put in a second order we had a hard time catching an employee's attention to order. We could not order from our server jayden because he was too busy eating at the bar table in front of us.   Finally we got the attention of the manager (jayden told us his name was Leo) and informed him of our capsaicin and shellfish allergy. He laughed at us also. We asked him if they would be able to make us a special roll with just fish/rice/vegetables due to our allergies and he didn't want to do that and suggested something on the menu. So we took his suggestion and ordered it. It got to our table and it had the immigration crab meat in it. My bf having the shellfish allergy did not feel comfortable eating it so I ate it for him and I removed the crab meat. Leo comes back and says..\"why did you not eat it. I told you it was OK to eat. Since you took out the crab meat we normally charge but we will let it slide by\". He kept hounding us about why we didn't eat the crab meat to a point where I got frustrated with him and he just said \" its OK I won't charge you for it\". Honestly, its not about the money and you letting it slide by, it's about our health. After I got frustrated with Leo, jayden comes back again and says \"good job\". Basically for getting mad at his manager.   Plates were just stacking up on our table and they were not getting cleared. After we got the roll with crab meat in it we asked another server to take it back because of the shellfish allergy and he said \" oh I'm not the one who took your order.\" then we asked him if he knew what shellfish was and he said no. So we just told him never mind.   We finally made our final order of beef skewers. We asked jayden what was in it and he basically looked at us and said duh beef. So we said we know beef obviously but what kind of beef and what kind of seasonings on it. He didn't know and didn't seem like he wanted to ask the kitchen. So we put the order in and the beef skewers were mixed in the same plate as the bacon wrapped scallops when it got to the table. So then my bf couldn't even eat that because it got cross contaminated.   We asked for the check and Leo the manager basically just dropped the check book and didn't say a word. They took it, gave us the check book back without saying anything. As we were about to leave,.. I waved down jayden and asked him what his managers name was. He said Leo? And I said it again.. What is your managers name and he hesitated and said leo and said... \"Are you going to yelp us?\" I didn't answer and just said thank you. Just him asking us if we were going to yelp them was obvious that he knew we had a very bad dining experience.   Never have I dined in a place where the servers and managers laughed at us. They tried to make us feel bad for not feeling comfortable eating something because of a food allergy. They tried to make us feel worse and say \"oh we normally charge but we will let it slide by\" when they are the ones that made the mistake. Servers were not knowledgeable about the menu. We had 5 different people take our order. They did not take us seriously. They were so disrespectful and honestly I can say I will never eat at that place again and will never recommend anyone to eat there. They should not be in the restaurant business. The foh shouldn't be at least.   Oh and be careful getting out of the seats on the opposite side of the bar. The lights are so low and in the walkway, I hit my head on it twice. I'm only 5 foot 4 inches too.",

We all ordered the all you can eat and began indulging in skewers, rolls, nigiri and just about everything. The food was just okay to me and on numerous occasions our server forgot a few of our items. For the same price for AYCE I would rather go to Sumo Sushi 2, and it's much closer to my house. The friends I went with who were raving about this place before we got there had even said the food wasn't as good this time around. Atmosphere is cool, young and trendy with some good music playing. Not cool enough to get me to go back for AYCE though... Would only go back if I was invited by friends again. Nobody in Vegas can dethrone Sumo Sushi 2 for \"Best AYCE in Vegas\" in my honest opinion!",

Good fresh sushi...everything was good, good menu choices, etc  The thing keeping it from being 5 stars is slow service (I think it was because I was eating too much) plus the lady kept asking me if I was sure, yes now bring the sushi!  The other thing was they don't offer half roles...this is key for all you can eat. I like to sample & not be committed to a whole role (ya so I have committment issues haha) My favorite spot sushi Mon on Maryland/silverado is still the best but about $27 for dinner.

The bad thing is that if you don't finish your plate they charge you for it. But we both liked our food, all of it tasted good. Had flavor.

The sushi is good and I gave this place 4 stars because I wouldn't say it's GREAT, but it's definitely good.  There are about 20 special rolls, but they are all very similar with only slight differences.  The nigiri is smaller in both rice and fish than normal, but that's good because you don't want to get full off of just one thing when there is so much to try.  The Spider Roll was the best roll we had here.  It was fresh and warm and so delicious.  I'm not a big fan of their ponzu sauce, which seems to be on everything.  We tried a piece of the cajun albacore. YUCK is all I can say.  The cajun seasoning tastes like something that should be left to grilled pork chops or steak, NOT fish.    The one thing that REALLY blew my mind was the Kimchi Fried Rice.  It's so amazing and delicious.  I know you may think you don't want to eat rice when you go for AYCE sushi, but if there is one thing you need to try, it's that.  It's a small bowl with a fried egg on top and it's EFFING yummy.    The service was fast and super friendly.  Had a great experience and would definitely go back.",

The last time we ate here I got food poisoning really bad, for 3 days. Also I was burping fish the whole time. That was the worst food poisoning I ever had.  So if you eat here. Good luck  Get me sick once, shame on you. Get me sick twice, shame on me for being an idiot for giving them another chance. The sushi isn't so fresh and is sometimes room temperature. That's pretty gross and unsanitary. Surprised no one has died from this disgusting place.",

    "text": "FOOD POISONING - FOOD POISONING - FOOD POISONING!!!  If you like food poisoning and want a nice little cleanse for your stomach, then come here. Otherwise, avoid like the Black Death medieval plague.   I'm usually not one for AYCE, but I was meeting up with friends that I had not seen in a very long time, so I thought why not.   There was a group of 6 of us.  The service was good and we were told that any food left over on the table would be an extra charge. This includes eating just the sushi and leaving any excess rice.   We ordered rolls, baked rolls, skewers, nigri, the works.  We all ate until we were all pretty full, got some mochi ice cream, paid, then left.   1 day passes* - I had a really hard time getting to bed and getting a good night's rest and felt really noxious. It felt like it came out of no where.   I had pizza for dinner with a friend that was visiting the states for the first time the evening before and had thought that it was the culprit that caused my non-stop barfing and diarrhea. I cancelled all of my plans for the day and decided to make the drive back to San Diego. The drive was an absolute endearing struggle.   After returning to health two days later, I spoke with my friend and found out that the AYCE sushi was the one to blame afterall since EVERYONE THAT ATE IT GOT SICK.   Stay away from this place. Your stomach will thank you. Consider yourself warned.",

On the plus side, lunch is a bargain at $19.99 and average for dinner at $24.99.  Service is very prompt, you will be visited often by the wait staff to take your order and the food comes back in about 5 minutes or less.  The sushi is decent, not exactly fresh, but pretty good for AYCE.  Their poke is a must order it's sashimi with ocean seaweed salad, (limited to one order per person).  Their BBQ skewers are typically not offered in AYCE sushi.  On the minus side, they charge $2.00 for hot green tea, you should order soda instead.  It's crazy busy during prime time, expect a long wait of one hour of more.",

Hehe  Some of the servers come off sarcastic because they see that I could eat a lot and I order too many foods so there's that face and the question of \"anything else?\" which I find very amusing.  They bring me my foods and they're perfect and that's all I care about!",

    "text": "I was torn between giving this place 3 stars and 4 stars. The reason I chose 3 was because although the food was above par, the service was not. We waited at our table for quite some time before someone came and asked us what we would like to drink. We ordered waters, and then a few minutes ago a different person came by to ask if we wanted something to drink. We ordered beers this time. Our beers came out relatively quickly but the waters never came out, we didn't realize this until our food came out. Again we waited for quite some time before we had to ask someone to come over and take our order. My friend doesn't like sushi and so he got a bunch of little appetizers. The rolls came out lightening fast but they just place them down on the table and mumble the name. Every time we had to stop them and ask them to repeat themselves, and tell us the name of the roll. The appetizers took forever for some reason and I felt bad because we were getting our sushi rolls but he wasn't even getting his miso soup. I don't think that the servers have assigned sections because different people were handling us the entire time. Every time we needed something we had to flag someone down.   Regardless of all this, the food was very tasty and the ambience was nice. Would go back again.",

They told me it would be between 35-50 minutes, so I called my family and told them when to arrive. The server gave me a call about ten minutes later and said our table was ready. No big deal, I called my family and told them to head there now. I was seated before my family arrived and when the waiter greeted my girlfriend and I, he was not only super rude, but told me he needed to \"make sure that there would actually be 12 people showing up.\" Really? Starting off my meal accusing me of fabricating my table amount for some asinine reason? As annoying as that was, he at least got us our drinks but every two minutes he kept frantically running back to our table area, look in, aggressively shake his head, and then run out without saying anything. He did this about five times before my family got there. Afterwards, he tried rudely and abruptly taking our order before we had a chance to review the menu and make our choices. After we placed our initial order he mysteriously disappeared altogether and a different set of staff began taking our orders. The food was decent but has absolutely taken a turn for the worse over recent months, and the drink refills were sparse at best. We have been coming here for two years and won't be back again. Management needs to do better and that server should look into a different industry if he's going to provide such atrocious service to guests that are paying large tabs and tips.",

At least they tried to help us with a 20% discount and didn't charge us for the untouched food since we were disgusted. The staff was nice I just wonder how the food is prepared behind the scenes.",

    "text": "Sushi Kaya used to be the best spot for AYCE sushi in town but after they started becoming popular the service and food had gone downhill. My boyfriend and I went a week ago on a Sunday and they weren't that busy yet but service was slow. Our order took 30 minutes to get to our table and when it came the fish were dry and the sushi rice on our rolls are so hard. We let it go and did not say anything because it was the first time that happened to us but 3 days later I went back with my little brother and the same thing happened. No one assisted us, no one gave ua condiments and plates. Our server even ended being on the bar because they were short handed and orders are being backed up.   Food and fish were the same. The nigiri are dry and so does the rice. You can tell they have been sitting there. We ordered Alaska roll because that's our favorite. It's normally in a foil because they are baked but this time they were just on the plate which made us think that they didn't bake it.   4 days later, I came back with my boyfriend which makes it today ( March 23, 2019 ) service was so horrible. We had to wait 30 mins for someone to come and get our order. Forgot to give us our plates, had to ask twice. Same thing happened with the Alaska roll, rice is hard asf that you cannot eat. It tasted disgusting! 2 orders of Baked Mussels took 45 minutes because they forgot to put in when that's one of the first food we ordered because we knew it takes awhile. I was so pissed that I went to the manager and explained what was going on. Told her how unhappy I am because of the service they've been giving us when my boyfriend and I are regulars. We come at least once or twice a week but after tonight, I think we are done with Sushi Kaya for awhile.   Fish and service has gone downhill.  Fish are dry. Rolls are bland and presentation are rushed because they are busy. Such a disappointment!   Servers, bussers and chefs does not care about the customers anymore! Only thing that I can say positive is the hostess but other than that everything else is 0.",

Pros: vegetarian/vegan option, great late night spot with accommodating hours for people who work in the industry, and hip music that isn't boring!     Cons: long waits, small space   Tips: This place is always busy! I would recommend calling ahead of time to put your name on the waiting list.",

We ordered few bits at the time and our server always made sure that our empty plates were clear and that we had food on the table or on its way.  The only complaint is that one of our party went to use the bathroom and there was a lady there that kept trying to touch her and hug her, she felt very uncomfortable and another lady who walked in had to intervene. When we reported this to the staff they apologised but didn't seem overly bothered. The lady that intervened however was lovely and cake over to make sure she was okay.  If you want value for money sushi, this is a place to go. Would definitely recommend to others and will be back.",

I used to love Sushi Kaya when i first moved to Vegas but tonight's experience was underwhelming and lackluster. Most of my rolls were served almost warm (and I'm not talking baked or fried rolls). The service from greet to farewell wasn't bad, but it was clear that no one was thrilled to entertain the basics of their jobs-ie.) be warm and inviting to guests. Bathrooms I will say we're clean enough-but the hallway leading to them was not. I used to be shocked when people would tell me not to go here, but I'm so understanding as to why now. There is a surplus of ayce sushi in this town and this one is now near the bottom of my list. They did just open a sister store Sushi Zone that I enjoyed and will use as an option in the future.",

During dinner @ around 9:00 pm on March 15, 2019 (posting time for the owner to look at the security cameras); one of the sushi chef's accidentally hits a large metal box over the bar.  The box came crashing down hitting my father in the face, hand, and landed in his food.  Being that the box was metal, everyone around us looked our way.   The sushi chef proceeded to laugh and said an unapologetic sorry to us with a smile.  We had to ask the hostess to come over to assist us because NONE of the busser's nor service staff came over.  The hostess changed his sauce tray and gave my father a tea.  My dad just decided to finish eating.  We assumed the tea was given as a way to say sorry.  Mind you, the sushi chef did not even speak to us all dinner.  If you ever eat at a sushi bar, it is just super uncomfortable when the chef doesn't even speak to you, since he's right there in front of you.  It wasn't until the bill came and we saw that they charged us for the tea that we finally decided to call a manager over.    After explaining the incident to the manager, he said it was just an accident and that he'll take care of us.  The manager didn't even apologize to us.  After the manager leaves, the sushi chef begins to slam plates down basically throwing a fit.  The bill came back with just the tea removed.  We were done and wanted to just leave at this point.  Absolutely nothing was done for us, we've received horrible service, and was put in an uncomfortable environment all dinner for a mistake the sushi chef caused, which injured my father.",

My party and I had to wait half an hour for a table at nine pm, but the wait was well worth it. They have some phenomenal special rolls...the Sex Bomb was the bombdiggity for sure!! My only criticism was the bathroom needed a sweep (and to be honest, an upgrade!)   We had a super attentive server and the catered to our every request.  The staff in general was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there, judging by their smiling faces.  After dinner we headed to the Noraebong across the way. We came out two hours later to see Kaya still packed with a wait...and it was after midnight! That says A LOT to me about the popularity and quality of this restaurant...it obviously goes way beyond our visit!",

When we walked inside there was not much room to stand and wait, it was VERY loud in there. I could barely here myself think. When we got sat down at the sushi bar the bar was VERY stinky like a busser couldn't of wiped it down before we were seated. I don't remember our waitress name but she had a tattoo behind her ear I'm pretty sure it was birds. She was rude to us she had a constant attitude about everything and rolled her eyes several times..   My friend order the \"Who is your dad\" roll and I ordered the \" Viagra roll\". Her roll was mushy it wasn't what she thought she ordered and she didn't want it no more but the service was shitty and our waitress never came around to check on us for her to be told. The Viagra roll was boring had no flavor to it whatsoever. We were just disappointed...   Apparently we had a new waiter come take care of us and my friend told him about the roll and that she was very disappointed with it and he said that he would take it off the check for us. He never did, so we had about 3 managers come take care of the situation. Nobody ever took it off the check our first waitress thought we were doing All you can eat when we said Al a carte. We paid $30 for 2 ROLLS! I've never paid that much for sushi before. We'll never come back to this place. Shitty service, shitty management, and shitty food. Normally at restaurants when a customer is unhappy they get reimbursed but not at this place.",

They have quick service and of course great food.   I figured I will write this review a few weeks after my last visit because I hope they will if not have already fixed the issue. After our meal, while finishing up, we noticed a little cockroach crawl on the bar next to my friends hand. Now, we grew up in a third world country so these things are not the type of things that make us go nuts. So, quietly, I grabbed the little bugger with the napkin and told the busser about it. He saw it, apologized and left.  Now at this point I was expecting a manager to come by and apologize. They didn't. Again were used to bugs being around the dining table growing up so my friend and I continued to enjoy the afternoon and not make a big fuss about it. We paid our bill and left.   It wasn't until we were in the car when we realized that we should have done more. Spoken to a manager about it or something like that. So, what we did was call them and told a manager exactly what happened. We even told them that don't worry, we're not making a big deal out of it or want a free meal or anything, we just want you to do something about it.   This happens on August 12 or 11.",

I had noticed that the fish had started tasting not as fresh, and the service had been starting to slip for a while now, but the last visit was so bad that I had to write about it. For starters, the staff was not organized. We kept getting asked, by five different waiters, what we wanted to order. We opted out of the all you can eat, so the we could relax & enjoy our meal, and take home leftovers. But, they didn't communicate with each other, so we kept getting interrupted by new people asking us what we wanted. The spicy tuna roll that we ordered was way too spicy, the ponzu sauce was too sour & not the citrusy tart flavor that it should've been, and the rice didn't stick together at all (Sushi Making 101). The staff were running into each other and the customers. Two employees were talking about going out & getting drunk on one side of me, on the other side, an Eastern European employee was trying, unsuccessfully, to hit on a waitress (\"I don't bite...\")  At the end of the meal, we were asking one waiter to bring us a box for our leftovers, while another came over and started dumping our food onto a tray to take away. At the end, the spicy tuna roll that I took home gave me an upset stomach. (never trust a fish that's been too overly spiced...) I personally will never go back there again. There are just too many BETTER sushi joints in Vegas to choose from.",

I liked their kitchen food better than the popular ones here since they had a variety of yakitori, sashimi (3pcs per person), more noodle dishes than average udon, and more.   For the first time ever, I couldn't try everything I wanted on the menu for ayce because I was too full. Usually I try everything that I want but my belly gave out on me... Will come back!   The service was good too or at least our server was. He was attentive and gave us suggestions. He even let us order more after closing although he could've easily said no.    5 stars for an ayce restaurant.",

    "text": "Hands Down my most favorite sushi place in Vegas. I usually go for the All You Can Eat during lunch. It's roughly $21.95.   The only cons I have is that they charged for our drinks ( I feel that drinks should be included), sometimes they take too long to take your next order so you are just waiting (which isn't terribly bad considering that it gives you time to digest a little in between rolls) and some of the items are limited like certain skewers and desserts (limited cheesecake, BOOO).  The pros are that you can order half rolls, which gives you an awesome opportunity to try a bunch of different rolls on the menu, it's very well priced for all of the options that you get, the food is fresh and tastes amazing.  My favorites are the Jackpot Roll, the Shrimp Lovers  and The Tornado (its baked). I love pretty much all of the shrimp tempura rolls though. I've taken a liking to lots of the non cooked rolls as well, but I always order that Jackpot Roll first.  The food is very good. The place is kind of small, but it gets the job done and I've never felt like it was overly crowded. Definitely worth a try if you are a sushi lover.",

I got AYCE and for the price it's not bad, if you break it down to the amount you're eating as to just getting one plate, well it's well worth it. I never liked sushi before(I know, crazy) until I tried it it was the best thing ever. The pancho roll is my favorite-the best one, but also the 911 roll, nemo roll, sex on the beach, evergreen, crunch roll and jackpot! Just a few named, wish I would've known my first time there. They're all a must try & im not into raw sushi so those wouldn't fall under that. Place is small, pretty packed often, service is okay, I feel like they feel repetitive if not then it seems as if they are. Overall decent, I recommend it. Been here 7 times already and haven't had any bad incidents. Of course some small things here and there, but then again where do you really get A1 service lol",

(Keep in mind that you shouldn't order something you will not finish, this is generally frowned upon.)  You can also try non-sushi dishes and dessert is included (definitely a plus) because no matter how full you are, you always have room for mochi ice cream, haha! :D (yes im  a glutton I know, I have a problem).

I would be embarrassed to recommend it to my friends. The last time I went there was a hair on one of the rolls, dust and spider webs on all the tapestries hanging from the ceiling, the tablesame were sticky with a layer of filth accumulated on it thick enough to be scraped off with the back of my chop stick. If the dinning room is that nasty it makes me seriously concerned about what is happening in the back with the food. Sushi restaurants are supposed to be extremely clean because they are dealing with raw fish, i guess sushi kaya did not get the memo. Very disappointing.",

Decided to give Sushi Kaya a try after a friends recommendation. The hostess said it would be 45 mins to be seated and we said that was fine. We went a few businesses down to have some drinks. I got a call in 35 mins saying our table was ready. -soon as we were seated we were served water and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered drinks and some rolls and and it wasn't long before our food arrived. You can order anything from skewers, nigiri and an assortment of other food when you get the AYCE. I tried the bacon/scallop skewers which were ok. The rolls were all delicious and I over did it as usual. Aside from the server forgetting a few of our drinks this was a great experience and I would return again.  They added %18 gratuity automatically to the bill which was fine since the service was not so bad.",

The place was cheaper than other all-you-can-eat sushi joints at $22.95 per person (pp), other places are $25 pp or more for dinner. My girlfriend tried the Green Tea Ice Cream and it tastes just like green tea (I knew not to get it because it didn't sound right, and apparently didn't taste right either because she didn't finish it). Beer was $2 a bottle. In review, it was a great place to eat at a very competitive price for all-you-can-eat. They also offer a stamp card for future visits. After 9 visits, the 10th is on them. Overall the service was great and the food was enjoyable, definitely recommended for anyone who likes all you can eat.",

If this was your first AYCE Sushi/Korean, you would definitely rank it higher but there are far better options in this fattening buffet town.  The japchae, seafood udon, and skewers are excellent, but most people are coming here for the AYCE sushi and the sushi/seafood is lacking. The proportion of fish to rice is small and not as fresh as its competitors.    I've been 3 times and on one visit everyone in my group had the mad case of battleshit shits from eating their \"fresh\" oysters.  (Shout out to Harold/Kumar and the 2 girls in the college dorm bathroom)  I also have a philisophical issue with going to a Korean owned restaurant for sushi.  Don't get me wrong.

    "text": "I should have listened to my cousins review before going here..  A good friend of mine recommend this place and she raved about how good it was, so naturally I was excited. There was six of us so we had to wait for a table to be set up which was no problem. Once we got our table our server quickly asked us what we would like to drink and if we were doing AYCE. Things were going pretty well and we were enjoying the food and the service till we hit the 30 dollar mark. Once we hit that mark it was as if we were invisible! We waited ten 10 to 15 minutes to make another order and from there we had to wait 30 minutes for our rolls! The most annoying part was that our waiter often looked at our empty table and never said a thing! Not to mention their hostess kept looking at our table as if we should be leaving! Hello we were waiting for our rolls! I told my friend about it and she was shocked, she mentioned that next time I go I should go with them. If things do change during a second visit I will update my review.",

The service was horribly slow. I had to keep asking for a refill. The sushi itself is okay but not worth all the trouble. Nothing stood out in particular to me. I thought dessert would make everything better but it took around 15-20 minutes for our order to come out. We had to ask another waiter to check up on it. I've been to Kaya once before and I didn't remember it being that bad. It's funny because they claim that you have 90 minutes to eat but a family, who had been there since we first arrived, was still there when we left.  Very disappointing service, sad to say.",

They are punctual and gear to take orders, refill drinks, and clear plates. But it's not the service that I'm disappointed with, it's the quality of the food. Much of the fish served here is precut and unfortunately I was getting slices that ranged from fresh looking and tasting, to old and tasteless. The amount of rice they give with the nigiri is crazy. The rice had a slight mush to it with little flavor. The worst had to be the masago (smelt roe) and the scallop. The Masago was mushy and didn't have any texture you would expect from fresh fish roe. The scallop was clearly premade hours before and left to sit. It's up in the air whether I am returning or not.",

Quite good! Fish is fresh and the cuts are good. All you can eat sushi lunch for $20 is great. Loved that you can order half rolls too so you can try more variety. I am always leary of buffets since you wonder how long the food was sitting there.. but that is not an issue here as they make the items after you order! Winner in my book. Plus, they have dessert. I was stuffed, but managed to eat a mochi ice cream for dessert. You have to! :)  Some (like my family) will complain that a sushi buffet with rice - you can't just get the sashimi fish - is a rip off, but i thought it was great.

The hostesses were nice but there was just this nasty stench... like when you leave a wet towel bunched up on the floor for a couple days. The menus were really dirty I didn't even want to touch them. We got seated right away so that's a good thing.  We had a party of 5 and got seated at a booth. The tables have a little call button that you press if you need something. We all decided to do the AYCE sushi. We ordered green mussels, a couple of hand rolls, couple of sushi rolls, and tons of nigiri. Most of the food came out right away. The green mussels took a while which was expected. What was weird was that the mussels came out before the hand rolls. Makes no sense at all. After we were all done with the sushi out waiter asked if we wanted dessert. We ordered mochi all around and also asked for the checks as well. The mochi took about 10 mins to get, the check took another 10 after that, then it took another 5 mins for them to pick up the checks. We all got so frustrated that we were pressing the call button and no one paid attention. Multiple employees walked by not even glancing our tables direction. After he finally picked up the checks it took another good couple of mins to bring them back. By the time we left we were all hungry again from waiting so long to leave.  The food wasn't even worth it. The salmon had a fishy taste to it. The tuna was good. The Ono, albacore, yellowtail were all weird tasting. The mussels were prepared differently than I'm used to but overall were good. The tako slices were really thin. Overall experience was bad. Most likely never coming back here.",

    "text": "First strike, waiting 1.5 hours for what was supposed to be a 40 minute wait. Strike two, drink orders were incorrect but I was willing to overlook such a minor mixup considering how \"busy\" they seemed until.... Strike three. My original review from 2010 can be completely disregarded considering the lack of customer service provided by Nate, who did not seem to understand what was communicated to me during my last visit less than two weeks ago, which was that my stamp card could be redeemed for a free meal during my next visit. This is what they have always honored for as long as I've been coming here. I had one stamp left to go until my free space; the server from the previous visit guaranteed that one of the meals would be comped if I came to visit for two. And no, this was not honored to me by one specific server; it is the tradition followed by every server I've ever had in the dozens of visits I've paid to this establishment. But this is the final time I will be dining here. The staff is poorly trained and, instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering to have a manager resolve the issue on his behalf, Nate chose to argue with me for five minutes, which was even more frustrating than his piss poor job at executing my bill. It's a $40 bill, which isn't detrimental to my wallet whatsoever but the audacity of my server talking down to me when he is at fault was appalling. There are plenty of places I can go to in this city for better sushi and this Yelp review will not be the last place I express my disgust for Sushi Kaya. Pass along the message that Kaya does not play fair and that Nate the server is clearly too good to put the customer's needs above his own opinion.",

The fish is not very fresh and the tuna has a grey-ish color when is should be a deep red. The specialty rolls are pretty small and are usually doused with overly sweet sauces. The nigiri has a thin, (almost transparent) piece of fish and a big serving of rice to fill you up. The service is very inconsistent as well. I would have someone check on me right after I got my food, but nobody was to be found when my water and plates were empty. I ended up taking a pitcher of water from the servers' station and bringing to my table. When it came time for the check, I had to locate a manger just to close out.",

I cannot give Kaya 5 stars because I don't believe their fish is as fresh as those spots previously stated. There's something to be said about fresh nigiri whose texture is as pleasant as it's mild, non-fishy flavor. Kaya's isn't bad, but there are definitely places serving fresher sushi. The rolls are tasty, but you can only take so much garlic ponzu and eel sauce before it's just too much. Much like the rules of eating quality barbecue, sauce should be an extra to the taste of meat, not covering anything up.  However, their service is unrivaled. There are call buttons utilized at each table for your convenience of ordering, but you won't need them. The servers are attentive and will be at your table no longer than every five to ten minutes or so. Everyone is mild mannered, a rare occurrence in an AYCE environment.  Another plus...they're open until 3am. Perfect for your late night sushi craving.",

I am part Japanese, and I have been to Japan, and trust me, real sushi chefs do not use any sauce! But hey I get it, this is America and they have to cater to their audience lol.

Of course I went for the AYCE, thats my M.O.  I ordered almost all of the raw Nigiri sushi items and a few things from the kitchen, no rolls.  The Nigiri was nothing to brag about, the servings were ok, but I found myself needing to add condiments for flavor.  The shrimp on the regular menu was dry and flavorless.  I also ordered the sweet shrimp, you can only do this once and with the dinner meal, they did not taste that fresh and were a bit sticky.  That's my other pet peeve about this place, there are only two dinner only items, sweet shrimp and sea urchin, and you can only order one.  If you don't like these two items and order them, then the dinner menu price  is not worth it,  There is one saving item on this menu, and this is the spicy seafood udon.  That was the most delicious item that I have had at this place and may come back again for it, but not for the AYCE.",

They didn't even refill my drinks until I asked. I was hoping the sushi would at least be good but it was ok at most. Oh and they also charge a 18% gratuity if you have more than 6 people, which would be fine if the service was even halfway decent. I had to fight with the supervisor to take that off my check because wasn't going to pay for people who got mad at me Everytime I asked for something. Don't waste your time or money here!",

I found a hair in my mochi previously and the server had the nerve to say it was plastic from the stick put inside. Came here again to give it another shot to find a bug in our food. Was not even completely compensated for the food, as the manager claimed it was \"impossible\" & it is \"out of their control\" to keep the bugs out since the door opens when clients come in/they are \"too busy\" to inspect food before serving it. Was a table of 4 & all they did was give ONE AYCE and a pina colada for free. The MANAGER tried adding the pina colada to the tab and when we checked it, all he had to say was \"oh I'll fix it\". Tab still came out to $85 after finding a bug in our roll. You would think after being loyal customers to this place, they would have the respect and decency to compensate such a terrible and disgusting experience. Would not recommend. Management is terrible and did not help with the situation at all. Service is terrible as well, wait forever for your drink order and never received our miso soup order. If I could rate this place 0 stars, I would. DO NOT COME HERE.",

I used to love coming here until I started to find bugs in the food multiple times and I tried to brush it the first two times because they apologized. However, the third time they still charged me for the dish (miso soup) and after I explained that there was a bug and showed them they apologized and took the dish off.  Whatever right? Well I just had lunch there today and there was a bug in the rice in the nigiri so I put it aside frustrated and when someone picked it up I let them know about the bug. The manager came over and yelled at me for, \"not finishing all of the rice.\" He told me he was going to charge me for that one piece of rice. I tried to talk to him but he was incredibly rude and would not listen so I told him that I would never come back.  I am currently looking for a new favorite sushi restaurant if anyone has any recommendations. It was good at first until it got me sick from the dirty conditions and the rude management.",

The reason they get 4 stars is only because on their bad days their rolls can taste a bit stale and I would say a 3 out of 5.

If you go after the busy lunch crowd during the week, its amazing.  If you go for dinner, a late dinner, then its ridiculous.  Hostess and servers are rude, some of the chefs are chewing gum while preparing food, which is a BIG no no while preparing sashimi/sushi.  When I saw the gum chewing I googled this place.  They were a part of dirty dining and just conveniently switched their name around.  I checked their board for the health inspection grade, and they were at a C after being shutdown.  You have to monitor the hostess to make sure she does her job.  I noticed that she let people jump the line because they were buddies/friends.

    "text": "For the past years, I've been coming to Sushi Kaya at least once a week, and refused to go elsewhere. Sushi Kaya may have once been the best AYCE sushi place, but has been going downhill for the past year or so in terms of food quality. And after this recent experience, I am assured that I will NEVER visit this place ever again.  Recently, I took my visiting friend to Sushi Kaya, ensuring her that this is my favorite sushi place in Vegas. I ordered the usual and was excitedly talking with my friend, until the food came out. We were shortly in shock. The rice must have come straight from the freezer; it was hard and cold. The sashimi pieces were disappointing -- not fresh at all. Long story short, everything was unsatisfactory and below average standards. My friend and I REFUSED to eat the rice, and tried to finish most of the sashimi, and did. However, the waiter came over to us TWICE, rudely demanding that we finish the rice.  If we had finished all of the rice, I know we would have gotten sick. The rice was not edible.  The food and the service were both disappointing, and while signing the check, I swore that I would never return to this place ever again. And I never have. There are plenty of other AYCE sushi places in Vegas, with equivalent or lesser prices and even better menus. I have no reason to return here ever again.  *In summary: Good interior and location but rude and unfriendly service + low food quality. Your choice, but no thanks for me. I'm surprised that this place is still in business.  *Update: For a better AYCE sushi experience in Vegas, I recommend going to Kaizen, my new favorite for some time now. I'm sure there are plenty others that are infinitely better than what you will get at Kaya.",

There was a group of 13 of us or so and they accommodated us in a nice isolated room by pushing long tables into a U shape.   The majority of us ordered AYCE and a few ordered a la carte. The service was slow but it didn't bother me as I understood we were with a large group and ordering various items off the AYCE menu.   I started off ordering miso soup, tuna poke, seaweed salad, shrimp skewer, and a few pieces of salmon and tuna nigiri.   I got the seaweed salad and tuna poke first, then the nigiri. Seaweed salad tasted the norm and the tuna poke was so-so. Tuna nigiri didn't seem fresh, but the Salmon nigiri was the complete opposite! Big portion of soft salmon on top of a small bed of rice, just the way I like it!!  After a while, the server asked if anyone wanted to order more. I let her know I was still waiting for my miso soup and shrimp skewer, which she said she would go check on. I went ahead and ordered udon, baked mussels, and garlic edamame.   Disappointing to say, the miso soup never came out (shrimp skewer did) and neither did the garlic edamame. I heard some of the girls across from me getting upset about not receiving their orders too. I was getting full so I gave up trying to remind our server...  - 5 stars for the salmon nigiri - 3 stars for the rest of the menu items - 3 stars for the service",

They have some fantastically named rolls (\"I love my ass\" and \"one night stand\" rolls cracked me up!). They also have what I think is their secret house sauce called \"yum\" sauce, that they put in almost everything  we ordered. For better or worse, you simply can't keep your mind out of the gutter with a creamy, off-white sauce named \"yum sauce\" that is drizzled *cough* all over 6-inch long rolls.....  While I love he value, and very friendly service, I have to admit that if the 6 different rolls we ordered, they all tasted pretty much the same. Maybe one had a slight spicy bite, while another had more crunch, they all could have been the exact same roll, all smothered in 'yum'.  Can't say any of the sushi tasted authentic or out of this world. But if you're hungover, starving, have a budget, and simply want sweet, creamy yum in your mouth, then this is the place to be!",

Who knows what the back kitchen where the fish is stored looks like. Must be disgusting.   I'm officially done with Sushi Kaya, the last time I was here I left with a stomach ache and my friend. Their fish must not be fresh. Don't eat here. Take it from my honest review; I usually don't take the time to write a review but this was just so bad to keep to myself.",

Way better options out there. Also the inside was dirty and the bathrooms were gross and needed updating.   Solid 1 star",

    "text": "Kaya used to be my favorite AYCE place about a year or two ago, but recently it hasn't been living up to the love and hype I used to have for it. The menu hasn't changed much in a long time, but what's really been an issue has felt like the quality of the fish and seafood.   The rolls and nigiri used to taste fresh and flavorful, to the point that I would order my favorites multiple times in one sitting, but on my last two visits, the fish has tasted kind of bland and dry and my squid nigiri tasted...weird? Off? Any rolls with spicy mayo also tasted way too strong, like they would overwhelm the roll. The last time I came here, I invited a friend from out of town and he seemed disappointed. I felt so embarrassed because the sushi here just didn't taste fresh anymore.   The service has always been pretty good here, though they work on orders slowly like most AYCE places so you wind up waiting awkwardly in between periods until your food comes out. It's why I do recommend ordering in bulk; if you're afraid you won't eat everything, I would usually order maybe 4-5 rolls when I'd go out with a friend, and that's always been a safe amount.  Fried and baked rolls will fill you up faster though!",

Service can be spotty. I notice that I had amazing service in the beginning, but it would go downhill from there -- which is why I usually make a list of a handful of things in the beginning and order it right off the bat. Yes, your girl can EAAATTT!!   I highly recommend ordering the Cinderella Roll, Sex on the Beach, French Kiss Roll, & Baked Green Mussels. There's something about their mussels that I absolutely love! My husband and I usually order a lot of it. However... To my surprise, I was looking over their menu during my last visit & found that they limited the amount of times that you are able to order it :( I was super disappointed which is why I had to dock another star. Limiting oysters and uni is understandable, but green mussels? I can definitely find another AYCE sushi place here in Vegas with AYCE baked green mussels. If you're not much into green mussels like my family & I are, then this probably isn't much of a \"loss\" to you.   Overall, this place is a 3 out of 5 stars at its absolute best.",

For Ikura lovers will say that the taste of it very weird.. They probably use not real one (simulation) or something like this.. I didn't enjoy Ikura sushi like I usually do at other sushi places. Also I got full too fast and didn't eat much, so I can't say anything but I'm wondering maybe they add some protein to the food, that people can get full fast and don't eat lots of fish when order all you can eat...",

The place is familiar to us after years of dining here, it has a laid back coziness and delightful consistency in food that taking first time guests here is a no brainer since you know Sushi Kaya will always make it right. The menus have changed over the years but a few staples have gladly remained such as their sushi nigiris and skewered offerings like grilled shrimp, garlic and mushrooms. They now also serve sashimi (yellow tail, salmon and tuna), albeit limited to one order per meal/person, it's still good to have. Their sushi roll menu is quite extensive and we found a few gems, but we predominately stick to ordering sushi being that we do come here for a good ALYCE sushi fix after all.  Oh BTW, a dessert tip: skip the cheesecake, as tempting as it sounds, it seems this thing has been sitting in the freezer for a while and suffers from freezer burns and a dry-as-chalk texture. Mochi ice cream is your friend (say it with me)!",

Fish portion and quality could be better and I wouldn't mind paying more. Nonetheless, fun times and very filling. Mochi ice cream is included, very good quality but limited to one per customer.",

The food is made to order rather than sitting out on a buffet line, and you actually get a lot of options to order as well. You can order appetizers, tempura, skewers, rice & noodle dishes, nigiri, sashimi, and even dessert! I feel like its pretty rare that AYCE sushi places allow you to order sashimi or nigiri. There's also a large variety of sushi rolls you can choose from, and they let you make half orders so that you don't get too full and can order multiple rolls. Despite being AYCE, the fish quality and sushi rolls are still good, and all the appetizers are great! I love the mussels and poke.   In addition, service is generally really quick considering this place is always packed when I come The manager usually walks around checking on tables as well. I've hardly had to wait for a table, and the food generally comes out fairly quickly. They don't wait to bring out everything at once so you can start eating as dishes come out. They come back frequently so you can order more as well. Also, there's a fee if you don't finish all your food, but I have never been charged extra for not finishing. On my last visit, I had a fair amount of food leftover, and the manager even told me not to worry about finishing it so that I could order dessert (for free too)!",

We went during their anniversary celebration so it was a little cheaper than regular days, although their regular price is pretty good still considering how good it is.  Their entrance is kind of hidden, so you have to look for the poster that says \"to Sushi Kaya\". There's a bunch of other Asian restaurants in the same strip as well. This place times you though so be sure you order well the 1st round so you don't have to keep waiting around to order more.  Their servers are pretty nice and efficient, just that one of the guys (the tall skinny one) didn't seem to care enough to keep going and help around- like he can't even be bothered to pour water for you and asks the others to do it for him- like c'mon dude, it takes less than a minute with the water pitcher right beside you, you know. *rolling eyes* Anyway...  They have a variety of entrees to choose from, and everything that we ordered was devine! Their tofu was crispy outside and soft on the inside, dipped in really good sauce. The baked mussels was flavored with some kind of syrup and cheese- and it was so fantastic that you HAVE to scrape off the cheese from the foil cause it was just that good! Their sexbomb sushi's sauce was very flavorful and made each bite a taste of heaven. Like I said, just everything here was amazing! What made it even better was each person gets one mochi (a kind of japanese ice cream) once you are all done eating- talk about a sweet deal! Definitely a must try for all sushi lovers.  I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in town!",

I really can't say anything positive about the selection on the AYCE menu or quality of food. If you find yourself trapped there, just order the yakatori skewers. The beef skewers were my favorite and they use marinated Kalbi beef. Unfortunately some of the skewers were really fatty, but it was the best thing out of everything we tried.  The nigiri rice to fish ratio is not proportioned and the rice was hard. The miso soup was watered down and placed on the do not order list.   This place just feels dirty and dusty when you walk in. The restaurant has been around for 10+ years, but I think it needs a complete renovation and a deep cleaning.  Thank you, next.",

The manager is constantly walking around to make sure that all of your orders are completed.  He even followed up on a few orders that was missed and heard him tell his staff to hurry up the order.  Third of all, the restaurant is spacious and has feels even bigger with very high ceilings.  The tables are quite large, enough to hold all of the food you will soon order.

My first time I was lucky enough to go with a group of friends and they already had a table.  No wait but I've seen people wait over 30 mins on avg.    The food- is good.  The service?  Needs work.  Few times servers and runners walked by me on the end of our big table and my water cup was empty.  I finally had to call someone over to fill it up.  My friends first were told that they were out of mango only to have another order come to our table 20 mins later...yep you guessed it- with mango!    The place has a nice atmosphere to it.  So 3 stars for now.   :)",

    "text": "Decent fish and great service from the servers. There was an incident where the power was out yesterday, the manager was forcing us to either pay with cash we didn't have or leave our cards' information we weren't comfortable leaving, or we could leave our phones and IDs there.  Understanding that their credit card machine was down, we asked the manager if he could look into us doing a bank transfer or Chase quikpay to himself, the owner or any employee who would be comfortable doing this, he refused to look into this option or discover any other options that both parties would be comfortable with, this I don't blame him but we weren't able to pay with cash and we were strongly uncomfortable leaving our cards' information with a stranger, plus we were not obligated to accommodate to this inconvenience caused by the sudden power outage.  If only the manager was respectful and understanding about it and not walk away from it, I am sure we would have come to a solution both of us would be happy with. That was the story but the point is, the manager was rude and told us they have already given us options and we had to work with it, I would have offered to leave my card's info if he had taken the effort to ensure us we would only be charged the amount on the bill, but his rude attitude was making it a night ruining experience during my stay in Vegas.  Nonetheless, this would be a 4-5 star restaurant minus the manager who doesn't fulfill his responsibility to solve problems and work with customers.  P. S. We would like to thank Chance, one of the employees at Kaya, who was willing to help and get this resolved.",

The tuna is okay, but I'm biased cause I like the way fresh fish is prepared in Hawaii, and we are a long ways from the ocean.

Though it's still not exactly the same (nothing is, unless you get the real thing in the actual country), the different kinds of sushi options that they had just blew my mind.   Everytime I come here, I always get the all-you-can-eat sushi, which is reasonably priced at $19.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. They charge for leftovers, so be careful in how much sushi you order at one time! The ambiance of the place is cozy and the staff is really friendly. They're really fast in bringing your food out, even when it's busy, so that's a definite plus. The food is amazing and I would definitely recommend this place for a nice date!",

You're given 90 minutes after you declare your table is all you can eat. You literally can order all you want with no restrictions. All you're restricted by is commonsense, always exercise it no matter what. We kept ordering the salmon nigiri which was amazing in all regards! We then started following up our meals with the house rolls and their various selection of tuna.  The biggest surprise to us was their willingness to let us consume so much halibut nigiri. The experience in a nutshell was outright positive. You're greeted by the entire staff with a loud HEYO!!!!! Seating took roughly 30 minutes and the staff were more then compassionate to help us with our friend. He has sight issues and the staff were kind enough to describe dishes to him and help him make selections.   Very professional and caring towards their customers. I highly recommend this place to anyone going to Las Vegas!",

I recently saw them on the local news for being a \"dirty dining\" spot after we ate there and it happened a week before we had went. I know True fans will go regardless though.  We got the bacon wrapped scallop skewers were good. I ordered the ahi poke, shrimp tempura and a few other things for appetizers. The spider roll, shrimp tempura rolls were good too. I just wish most of the rolls didn't have ponzu sauce. But we tried only a few rolls because we were in a rush to go somewhere afterwards.

They provide you with a stamp card of which I have filled up three of them and working towards by fourth. Their AYCE menu is huge combined with nigiri, half rolls, full rolls, hand rolls (you have to ask for them), specialty rolls. Every time somebody tells me they want sushi, this is the place I highly recommend.  Some of my favorites are the sashimi poke, who's your dad roll, brooklyn bridge roll, black dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll, ebi, and unagi.  My only complaint, is the parking lot is extremely small (not their fault, their is a few restaurants in the same lot) and sometimes I have to park next to the mall in the other parking lot and walk.  *** TIP *** If you are going CALL AND MAKE A RESERVATION beforehand. Sometimes the wait can be 45 minutes (which I have done plenty of times because the food is that amazing, plus the shopping mall is literally in the next parking lot.  Food - 10/10 Service - 8/10 (sometimes they forget to bring rolls and I have to repeat myself) Atmosphere - 9/10 (I just would prefer the music choices to be different. They play a lot of the \"hip\" songs.)",

    "text": "Pardon me, but I did come and eat here twice in a week :P Yes I enjoyed it that much to have an AYCE again and eat like a queen, king, the whole kingdom of Suki Land. I have to say this is my favorite AYCE restaurant from all the others in Las Vegas. It's simple, fresh quality nigiri, rice perfectly formed ( not overly packed ), and everything I ate was GOOD, not mediocre... Tasty and satisfying good!!!   Parking could be a hassle on weekends and holidays. Be forewarned.. parking was full in this complex, so I parked in the Chinatown complex nearby Seafood Palace restaurant and minding my own business.. then slap right on my driver side window.. a warning note that my car will be towed next time I park in this area. Damn serious?! This lot is empty late at night, I'm doing this lonely lot a favor by parking here kiddin' me?!!??!! I guess the security guard saw me skipping happily away to Sushi Kaya and he got jelly.. I don't blame him.. I would be so jelly too, knowing I'll be chowing down some real good eats in a few minutes.   Sushi Kaya is tucked in the corner right next to Cafe Noodle & Chinese Barbecue restaurant. If you're not the type that reads signs and banners.. you might as well missed this place and gone to Anime Ramen. I lived here all my life and never even knew about this place until a few of my lovely coworkers decided to eat here after a crazy night at work. Fell in love that night with Kaya.. Sushi Kaya that is. Then came here again a few days after with my Family for my Brother's going away get together.   The owner is extremely kind and welcoming. Took our names and in matter of minutes, we were seated and our server, Juno, that's another story was attentive, patient, and sound in service. Almost like he had sixth sense of when we wanted to order more, to taking finished plates, drinks refilled, to just anything we needed he came around every time to see how we were doing and if we would like to order more. Couldn't have asked for a better server, yet alone a very handsome one :D   We didn't order any rolls, but only nigiri... Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, Scallop, Uni, and Sweet Shrimp. All were fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Salmon... never had it like this before.. melts just melts so smoothly in my mouth. We ordered ten orders of Salmon and Tuna. The cuts from the Salmon was the best quality I ever tasted.. Both my parents mentioned about it too. Unfortunately, it was so good that I forgot to take pic of it. Once I saw the dish, I devoured it.. I mean my Family and I killed the nigiri. We were like synchronized machines.. one by one.. nonstop. Finishing everything... Clean.   Raw oysters were fresh & ended with a reviving bite. I insisted that my brother's gf and my mother to eat it all, since I'm single.. know what I mean :P Eh anyways so much more food to enjoy, I just wanted everybody to eat a lot & be happy.   Bacon/asparagus and bacon/scallop... do I need to say more.. flavor madness.. must try!!  Shrimp and calamari tempura had such a light, crisp crunch. Not too oily or salty. The batter they make this in had to be fresh every time. I seriously enjoyed every bite!   Cucumber, Seaweed, and Salmon Skin salad.. sum it up with one word.. Refreshing!!!  My two favorites... Ginkgo nuts and sweet potato diced skewers. I'm not shy to order 20 each and cheerfully finished every single piece. I'm the killa of these two and don't tempt me to strike again, because I will! *chomp chomp chomp  We ordered desserts consisting of: five orders of mini cheesecakes, mocha almond/green tea/red bean ice cream, and green tea/red bean mochi.   In waiting.. I completely forgot I ordered  three orders of baked green mussels and the food runner goes.. ooooh are you done with dinner?!!? We all said Yeeeees. Then she goes oooh, but I have your last order of these mussels? Then my whole family looked at me haha I go... it's okay... no problem.. I'll still take it :P Done. It had a caramel finish in taste and cheese topping. Very yummy for my tummy. No problem...  Desserts all came and I ended up finishing all the mini cheesecakes, since my family warned me they couldn't hang anymore.. what I say... No problem.. I'll eat them for you. My Brother keeps saying out loud.. Damn my sister can eat!! Damn right. Weak sauces... nah just kidding. We all did a great job in finishing all our dishes.   From start to finish.. it was a great experience in dining here. Food and service were on point and never at any given moment was it a disappointment. Food came out promptly and never once were we just sitting there without anything to munch on. Always busy eating away!!! Ha! :P   The price is so reasonable and exceptionally affordable compared to other AYCE places. Don't forget to ask for a punch card to redeem after 10 visits :) And best of all.. it's open late hours.. last call I believe is 2:30 in the mooorning, seven days a week. Even the interior design of this place is cozy, love the bird cage looking lamp!",

I don't know why but the floor is always slippery walk to the restroom with caution the music is super loud here so loud it will have you shouting across the table to your date the only plus side to the music being so loud is you can fart all you want and nobody will hear it and they have the same 15 annoying songs on repeat that get stuck in your head and haunt you all night while you are trying to sleep get a new playlist Kaya. Other then That the food is good and they will have you waddling out the door satisfied.",

    "text": "I don't eat fish, but as you probably know everyone else you know does and when you're in Vegas it's pretty good odds you're going to end up at a sushi place. So while everyone else will concentrate on the seafood related menu options this review is for those of us that don't eat seafood. For many years my group of friends would go to another place in a strip mall that seats about 3  1/2 people which naturally makes large groups hard to seat, and in case you have a short attention span I don't eat fish so the choices were limited to appetizers so I had about twenty plates varying between teriyaki chicken and beef, Miso, and cucumber salad.    This year however we went to Sushi Kaya and they had a ton of choices and they were all great I especially liked the beef bowl. I especially liked that the service was fast, we ordered our first round and the waiter looked at us and said \"the food comes fast you really need to order more.\" And he wasn't kidding. For desert I really liked the mini cheese cake, which of course you're saying who doesn't like cheese cake, right? Well I loathe cheese cake so consider it high praise from me.  Now if you eat fish from what everyone said that was all good too, but really just read another review if you want more detail.",

We managed to get three rounds done and everything was pretty tasty. The quality of the food we got was good and the longest we had to wait was no more than five minutes after ordering. Even if someone wasn't our waiter, we were asked if we wanted to order more which was nice and they weren't overbearing.",

When the server was called he did not show emotion and didn't apologize. He didn't even know what was in the dish.

All the sushi rolls on the menu were half off making this place the cheapest sushi place I have eaten at. I had 3 rolls and an appetizer for 15 dollars! The sushi was very fresh and they put very little rice on their rolls and sushimi.   Their combo specials are:  1.) classic roll + miso soup + mini salad for $6.00 2.) chef special roll+ classic roll+miso soup+mini salad for $8.00 3.)2 chef special rolls+miso soup+mini salad for $10.00 *The small salad that they serve comes with ginger dressing.

Me and my siblings usually come here for dinner time or late night eating session after walking the strip or watching a Vegas show. Price is fairly reasonable at $25 per person if you do the AYCE. If you don't have an appetite you can order individually but cannot share food from those who did choose the AYCE choice.   There is so many sushi rolls to choose from and I would recommend to try them all if you could. Don't over order because you can get full very fast. The skewers are delicious and I enjoy the beef tongue skewer and the bacon with scallops. Both are tasty ad juicy ,not overcooked. I like the gyoza and the calamari but then again you can never go wrong with appetizers. My friend tried the Uni Nigiri which she thought was delicious (it's not my thing so I did not think it was as yummy). Anything with spicy ahi or shrimp tempura in the rolls were delicious. Fish does taste fresh and just enough spicy.  The setting is almost like a mix of korean and japanese. They have some korean art work up as well as play korean music if you can hear it in the distance. Wait time can vary if they are busy, I think they longest we have waited was 45 minutes for a table.",

    "text": "So, I lucked out and this place wasn't super slammed last night (Monday of Chinese New Year) when I took a couple clients here. The 3 of us were sat immediately upon walking in at 7:20pm.  We lucked out.  It's pretty close to The Mirage (where they were staying) and it's pretty easy to find provided you know that it's tucked into a strip mall in China Town / Little Asia.  Parking was a bit tough since there are a couple other eating establishments in the same strip mall so .... that might be problem.  We had to circle the lot and on the second pass a car left so I could snap the spot.  The Good: - Dinner AYCE is $25 - Good variety on their menu - All the rolls we ordered (can't remember them all) were tasty ... some were better than others - Our favorites: Jose Roll; Rainbow Roll; Kaya Roll - They don't drown their rolls in sauce ... the sauce is an accent... not overpowering - The ginger was fresh and crisp - The Green Tea ice cream was smooth and creamy - And most importantly... my clients liked everything and were stuffed  The Not so Good: - It's pretty loud in there when it's busy - Had to flag down servers to order and get refills - The servers didn't explain how the AYCE works (luckily I'm well versed and explained it to my guests) - While the rolls were good, the sashimi wasn't the best (I use Naked Fish as my standard on sashimi)  The I don't know where to rank this: - We also ordered the Baked Mussels which were served HOT (that's good) but it was in a creamy, cheesy sauce.... it was good but couldn't really taste the mussel... maybe that was the point - The Red Bean ice cream was good but the consistency was grainy",

    "text": "Susho Kaya is tucked into a corner of the infamous China Town.  One of the things I love, love, love about Vegas is the abundance of AYCE sushi. Sushi Kaya offered fresh rolls. There was no half roll option (which really bums me out when you are dining with only two people or by yourself). There were no rolls that really stood out to me.  One cool they do offer is a punch card. Yes, ladies and gents, a punch card for AYCE sushi. 10 punches and you have a free AYCE sushi dinner. This almost makes up for the half roll option.  Then when the bill came, they don't take card for orders under $10. This again put a sour damper on my night.   Good sushi, weird policies, and a punch card. Solid 4 stars.",

We seat down and were warmly treated, they have an extensive menu, and we ordered. A couple minutes into being seated at the bar a caca rocuhe ran up from under the bar. My wife noticed it, I tried to play it off and said I didn't see anything, wanting to give them a chance, but momentarily later it resurfaced, and that was the end of our visit. We very quietly got up and let the manager know, who was very apologetic. When we exited the restaurant a family was looking under an suv, I thought they had hit the curb, nope it was a dead rat.",

I fell inlove with it the first time I went!  $20-$25 for all you can eat sushi, and wonderful service! They always have at least 6 people running around helping customers even if it is not the table or section they are assigned.   Only down side I would say is the place is kind of small for how busy it is, I definitely think they should expand!   Other than that the tables are spacious and comfy, again amazing service and the food is TO DIE FOR!! Even my toddler loves coming here with me and eating off my plate.   Always recommend the Sweety Roll, Dynamite, and Baked Muscles!!",

We would rather go next time @ Oishi sushi on  W. 215 - rainbow/warmspring, or Yama sushi on flamingo/maryland, or go to a buffet @ Makino on Flamingo/Decatur,  or @ Kabuki resto (best in town!) in town square... but never again to this place!",

I'm going to assume this isn't their fault, but regardless it's unappealing for a restaurant.   Several of the serving dishes were noticeably chipped. I'm no expert, but that seems like a food safety hazard to me; Let alone how it impacts the presentation.   The food was phenomenal as always, especially the house made pot stickers. Light, flaky and full of flavor. A must order.   Our server was decent, I guess. We said we wanted to wait for our Japanese Lasagna roll to come before we ordered more...and didn't see her again for 25 minutes. Just because I want to pace myself doesn't mean I want to be ignored or I'm done eating.   I'm sure I'll be back, but my expectations have definitely been lowered.  Finally got to order another round and dessert...the mini cheesecake came out frozen. Literally rock hard. What the hell?",

    "text": "And the winner to my very first review goes to... THIS PLACE.   Why? It's the very first AYCE sushi joint I have consistently gone to over the past two years or so after discovering it (despite my lack of check-ins), and of course, because I have really come to love the specialty rolls, appetizers and nigiri here.  Like any sushi place I've tried, I end up loving the most awkwardly named rolls to say out loud on the menu- the Sex Bomb is my fave here. My other usuals are Brooklyn Bridge, Wall Street and Mango Style. Salmon nigiri is always refreshing, as well as the white tuna. I have fallen into the habit of getting a side of garlic ponzu sauce to dip them in. Spicy garlic ponzu sometimes too! They have THE BEST beef skewers, so tender and flavorful, but it's on that infamous *one order per person* list :(  I LOVE THE PLUM WINE ICE CREAM. End of story.  In general, the actual restaurant is nice and decently spaced. At the tables that you would think receive a lot of neglect because of its placement don't! They all have call buttons to press to prevent that from happening. It's decorated nicely, with pretty Christmas lights that are up year-round and funny Japanese masks that make me laugh if I stare too long.  Service is pretty speedy, except when busy but that's expected. Good price for AYCE and they have stamp cards! All in all, one of the better end sushi places in the Chinatown area of Vegas. Recommended for sure!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I love AYCE places, however I have never had a good AYCE sushi until Sushi Kaya. While we are on the positives let me begin with the fact that most of the rolls are REALLY GOOD, my best advice would be to get half rolls that way you get to try different rolls.Also the little ice cream at the end is pretty good.  Now let's talk about the reasons why I might not be returning to this place. First of all service is somewhat slow and not so friendly (It may just be a language barrier), if my water is empty for more than 5 minutes then we have an issue. Second, when the rolls started coming in we had play a guessing game trying to figure out which one was which one since the server just dropped them off without saying a word (this gets frustrating after a while since several of the rolls look really similar). And finally this is probably the biggest negative of this place, the cracked/chipped plates. As other reviewers already mentioned the majority of the plates are cracked/chipped and I was scared from a food safety perspective, especially when we are talking about uncooked meats (sushi).  Overall a good place to try out once, but probably won't be back.",

Lately the past few visits their service is just not so great. It seems like a whole new crew, because Im not seeing any familiar workers. The servers always have a resting bitch face which comes out intimidating, and always to have some sort of attitude taking and giving our orders. They never seem to smile or like to talk, we tried greeting one our servers and thanking her, but she just slid the sushi place on our table, rolled her eyes, and walked away. It was an upsetting and awkward dinner.",

If you're in the mood for good food and you don't mind crappy customer service, then this place will suit you just right.   I've been to sushi kaya many times in the past and wasn't always impressed with their customer service. The main reason I come back is for the decent pricing and good food. I even had my birthday dinner here last year. Their sushi selection is good and the AYCE menu has a variety of appetizers and tapas. I can't remember how much the lunch AYCE price is but dinner is ~$25 which is pretty competitive compared to other sushi joints around town. Aside from the food, their service totally got in the way and ruined my likes for this place. They're open until 3am but last call is at 2:15am. I opted not to get AYCE because we got there at 2am and 15 minutes was definitely not enough time for me to order a crap ton of food. I ended up getting stuff from their regular menu (kimchi fried rice $8.95 and four pieces of agedashi tofu $5.95) while a couple of my friends did AYCE. While my friends were ordering, the waiter kept interrupting them saying they were not allowed to share their food with myself and another friend since we were ordering stuff from the regular menu. We could tell he was not happy that they were doing AYCE right before closing time. It was just a huge disappointment. If you're gonna offer hours of service until a specific time, have the decency to honor and uphold it! They were pretty quick with bringing our food out but that's probably because we were the only guests there, aside from a couple that were seated a little before us. Near the end of our meal, they came by to ask how we were doing. My friends were missing a couple of their orders so they went to check. The waiter argued that we had received the orders already and defaulted the blame on the server, excusing her because she's still training. Regardless of the fact that she is new, he should not have argued with us. It was not professional by any means. We finished eating and continued to sit there to chit chat but noticed that it got extremely cold around 2:40ish. I'm not sure if they cranked up the a/c to get us out or if they just had a door open. We paid our bill and there was still 20 minutes left before closing time. We probably should have left right away since we knew they were closing but we were in the middle of a great conversation which was interrupted by the waiter. He came over to tell us that we had to leave because they were closing. I totally understand but it was very awkward. He didn't walk away from our table until we got up to leave. It's not like we were gonna camp out there all night.  I wasn't happy walking out of there. I'll probably come back again but it will definitely not be my first choice.",

We came here at 3pm it's not even busy, maybe 6 tables no huge parties. We order food and they didn't bring some of the dishes we ordered. I ordered bacon scallops and I literally had to ask the server 4 times where they were. He never came to check on us, no one did they just looked at us and walked away. Finally we got upset and asked them where our food was and he said I told you the first time we ran out of bacon and scallops by that time I was so upset and told them it has been 15 min and no one had asked if we wanted anything else. The server argued with us that he did come and check on us which was not professional at all. Then he switched table with a different server, and the table next to us were upset too for the same thing. Never recommending this place or coming back. Horrible service",

The good thing about this place is that they don't fill their rolls or nigiri with lots of rice like other ayce sushi places. They have a great selection of rolls but in the end they all start to taste the same. They use the same ingredients for most of them if you read through their descriptions.   They come around often to see if you want anymore or anything you need. The service is good and quick.   I would recommend this place.",

The nigiri selection is decent and the fish pieces are huge.   AYCE dinner is $27 and I think I would have enjoyed myself a bit more if I had sat at a table rather than the sushi bar. Servers grab their orders off the top of the bar, and there is a lot of hustle and bustle and shouting that interrupts the dining experience. Not a big deal since sitting at the bar meant not having to wait long, but something to consider.   Sushi was pretty fresh, but I didn't have anything that really stood out. I'm actually leaning toward 3.5 stars because Kaya is a solid sushi spot...just nothing special in my opinion.",

I get that it seems a little shady that towards the end of our meal once we got the check we noticed the bill was wrong.      First off, I asked for separate checks. They didn't do it. Second of all the manager came right next to our table and asked the girls next to us if they were okay and said nothing to us. Which I thought was poor customer service, but what really urks me is that I made an innocent mistake and stated that both myself and my friend were doing all you can eat when really it was just me doing all you can eat.         I thought I heard my friend say \"yes\". I get it MY FAULT! That's what I told the waiter and the manager! I said, \"it's my fault, not yours but can you help us it was an innocent misunderstanding, my friends first time, WE MESSED UP\". They gave us their policy and procedure story, which is fair, but I didn't yell, I didn't disrespect them, I was just assertive. I asked if the manager could help as a one time gesture. He said NO. I ADMITTED to messing UP! I didn't lie and cause a scene, but he refused to help!   When you work in customer service I understand you can't always compensate for the client's error, but they didn't trust us even after I recited everything I ordered. They didn't listen and care to help.      The atmosphere and music were fine, the waitress she's fine. Overall, great food. Service was slacking a little more than normal. Usually, they are much more on point and they check on us more. The hostess, the guy James was great, but the Male MANAGER did NOT have good customer service. BAD experience. I hope it was his off day. ... Unfortunately, I guess I never posted this, but this occurred in  2016.",

    "text": "Wow, just had lots of dust fall in my food twice over there. Please keep an eye out on dust falling into your food. They will most likely start wiping down the wood near the front after what happened. Just look up and see heavy amounts of dust. I should have taken a picture but I let it go because sometimes bad things happen.  Anyway they relocate us to another table and the busser brought the same drinks over from the dusty table.  When I asked him nicely to change it because of the dust issue he rolled his eyes at me making the whole experience terrible. I did not ask to change it to make his life harder, but because dust was flying everywhere when they wiped it down.   I previously wrote great things about this place but will have to change that with this terrible interaction.  When I spoke to the manager he tried to lie and say he did not roll his eyes and they asked me to leave. He was trying to argue with me when I called his attitude out.",

    "text": "Shrinking menu?  Been a regular at this spot for about 4 years now, and we fell in love with it instantly. Buuuuut, in the past 6 months, there have been some changes.  Let's start off with the overall dressup. Parking is very, VERY limited. Kaya shares a lot that houses multiple restaurants and shops, so on a busy day like today, expect to park and walk from the neighboring China Town Mall. When you walk in, the interior decor is simple and inviting. Mixture of Hannya masks, and story art. Sushi bar is big enough to seat about 15 people, and a private party room that seats Mayne 20. They can combine tables for larger parties. They are very clean here, mopping, and keeping tables clean and ready for the next paying customer.  Ambience is mellow, with mixed genre music playing in the background. What we come for: AYCE, usually dinner because that's when soft shell crab, uni, and sweet shrimp are available.  Special rolls: Mango style roll - inside mango, crab, cucomber. Outside: salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and avocado with aspicy garlic ponzu sauce  Spider roll - inside: crab, avocado. Outside: cucomber, gobo, and kaiwari with eel sauce   Ok so here it is. We've never had bad service here ever, but like I've mentiond, changes. Let's start off with the menu. No more softshell  crab app.. (nooooooo!), and no or limited Uni. Hmmm.. sweet shrimp doesn't include the fried head anymore. OH! And not to mention my Sake (salmon) kama. Yup, deleted off the menu like a smelly fart. There are more deletions, but these were my top ordered items.   small FLAVOR! Ever since Kaya has been getting more business,  flavor has been ghosting. (There but pretty faint), almost bad enough where the \"Ghost Hunters\" may have a hard time locating their taste pallets.. The baked green muscles definitely changed. Too much cheese, making it dry. They used to have larger muscles, but now use a huge shell, and put 2 small muscle like \"thingys\" in its place. It says spicy sashimi poki, but missing that kick. We do not usually order \"special\" rolls, but tried the spider and mango roll due to them being new arrivals. All I can say is, I'm sticking to Nigiri.   Anyways, Sorry Kaya, you have dropped from being our first choice as our go to AYCE. The customer service is good. Having separated the duties to server and waitress only, helps them concentrate on their jobs.   NOTE: tried ordering redbean mochi or icecream. Nothing, star drop.  Ok so to end it, we still like it here. Not the best hype like back in the days, but enough to fight those raw fish urges. I have a stamp card that needs one more signature,  then we get a free meal, so I'll save it for the update. Not the best, not bad. Looks like we'll have to find another sushi diamond.",

    "text": "Service and food get WORSE each time I get here! I've been here about 4 different occasions at different hours/day's and bringing fewer and fewer people along. I brought my cousin here today for lunch and while we were seated immediately it took a FULL 20 MINUTES for the wait staff to ask us what we wanted to eat. Not to mention the ladies sitting next to our table were seated and asked what they'd like to order within the first FIVE MINUTES Of being seated? Is it because they're white? Because we're Filipino? Because my cousin wore hoops? Tell me why that's acceptable? And when I complained to the waiter he spent the next ten minutes eye-ing me down until near the end of our meal. Prejudice and racist service, they gave us old brown tuna-which fresh tuna btw is a nice red or pink color. It isn't smushed up, it isn't freezing cold to the touch, and fresh is certainly NOT what they served myself and my cousin. Please explain why you would serve old fish in the middle of the day? Our meal was at LUNCH time. That's disgusting and I feel so bad for anyone who would be eating later in the day if this is their way of serving meals or preparing food. I had to demand and repeatedly ask for missing portions of our meal and it wasn't until I put my Louis bag on the table and literally took my phone out to time the poor service / wait, did they actually start to be remotely attentive. A waiter actually asked me if we had even ordered 30 MINUTES into us being seated at our table. Why are you waiting so long to realize there are people I served at your restaurant ?! Bottom line is if you're expecting to eat fresh sushi and be treated respectfully then I GUESS you should bring your money to the table and not show up there as a medium/darker skinned person. I'm never eating here again and I'll certainly not bring my cousin here again-she's 15 and should not be exposed to this prejudice.",

The waitress also immediately brought us water, asked us if we wanted anything else to drink and suggested a few starters. We ordered around 20 different half orders of rolls and appetizers with Moshi to finish the night. Everything was delicious, uniquely prepared and fresh. Hands down one of my favorite sushi experiences and for the $30pp unlimited tasting price, can't beat it!  They do charge for pieces you don't eat but that's normal at any all you can eat establishments. It clearly says it on the menu anyways. This is a great place for first time sushi eaters and those who like cooked rolls. They also have the healthier raw ones here too",

They had a great assortment of rolls, appetizers, nigiri, etc. The food was decent, but not my first choice for sushi in the area. They do charge for leftovers so don't over do it. The food came very fast even though it was busy, and the service was very good. Overall okay sushi spot.",

The 5 stars are for the food and selection on AYCE menu. The staff are nice but kind of slow...which I've come to expect at sushi restaurants so I don't even care any more as long as the sushi is good. Like I said the AYCE menu has so much selection, and you can order half rolls which is very important to us because we like so many different rolls and most places don't offer half rolls. The sushi is just delicious. I also love the udon and mushroom skewers. The price is very good too and even a few dollars cheaper than most other places. We will definitely be visiting this place often...only down side is that it's small and usually busy, and waiting area is super tiny. But the food is worth it!",

What ticked me off the most was that 2-3 servers have walked past our table several times, glanced at our bare table. Not even a \"someone will be serving you shortly\" or any form of acknowledgement, just table glancing. Despite the servers passing our table plenty, we were never approached. We heard from reviews that this place would be hot and busy, but the sushi bar was not full and there were some empty tables, so it wasnt busy yet we still got ignored! Ignoring this place FOREVER like how they have ignored our presence.",

    "text": "Yelp 365 Challenge - Review 014/365 (8/14/2011)  We ate at SK by accident on our last day in LV.  We actually intended to go to Sushi House Goyemon but, after being denied a table and only offered seats at the bar, my friend decided to storm out ... and we ended up here.  The restaurant was easy to find.  Parking was a joke, however, even on a weekday (apparently).  Since Sushi Kaya is part of a strip mall, it wasn't easy to find a space.  Oh, and don't even think that you can stand outside your car for even a minute just to relax for a bit. We tried to do that after we ate and there was already someone waiting to park.   I thought the food was OK.  The AYCE menu confused me at first, what with the spatter of asterisks all over the front and back.  If I recall correctly, \"**\" denotes items that are max one order per person, while \"*\" denotes items that are raw fish or seafood.  Sadly, I looked over all the options and realized that most of what I wanted included the \"**\" stipulation.  All-You-Can-Eat was beginning to look more like All-We-Say-You-Can-Eat, which in turn made me (slowly but surely) lose my appetite.  I chuckled to myself when most of the food arrived at the table because the portions are suuuuuper tiny!  The only exceptions (that I saw first-hand) were the specialty rolls.  On closer examination, however, I discovered each of these rolls to be heavily packed with or drenched in sauce.  I suspect they do this in the hopes that some people get fuller faster, for less ... because that's what happened to me.  On the positive side: 1.  The restaurant was clean and well-maintained. 2.  There was no delay for a table. 3.  The waitresses were attentive and friendly. 4.  Our orders were quickly fulfilled. 5.  The atmosphere was quiet and unclaustrophobic. 6.  Price is relatively cheaper compared to other AYCE sushi places.  Three stars for Sushi Kaya.",

Items say 15 minutes to cook which was fine but we got one 10 minutes after ordering and the next 10 minutes after finish eating the first order. Thankfully we were sharing anyway. Waitress says teriyaki comes with soup or salad and a choice of tempura (shrimp or veg). Order the shrimp and soup. Get shrimp tempura first then fried rice. Fried rice was alright but it tasted like the pan it was cooked in also cooked something that burnt. Husband liked it so whatever. I ask a water refilling waitress about our soup and she said she would ask about it. 5 min later, same waitress is  passing our table but no answer. Teriyaki comes (very disappointing, non-sticky rice but good sauce, chicken and veggies) and we ask that waiter delivering about the soup and he said he would ask. 1/2 into eating teriyaki, waiter is walking around us but no answer. I go to front and ask a different waitress and she said it doesn't come with soup or tempura (!??!). Go back to table and ask our original waitress and they bring us 2 instead of 1, after everything was eaten. For all you can eat, multiple wait staff might work but not so good when you just want to eat other food.",

We went today and put our names down for a party of six and the hostess (more on her later) took down our number incorrectly. After waiting outside to be called for about 30 minutes, since the waiting area is so unbelievably small, we decided to check on the wait time and she said that she called the number that we gave her five times not knowing she took it down wrong. After waiting inside for about another 20 minutes she decided to give us a table. I say \"decided\" because I over heard her tell a server that she only gave us a table that soon because we kept bothering her. First of all that is rude and unprofessional to say to anyone let alone a customer. Second of all it's literally her only job to seat people and she couldn't even do that right. We will not be returning here because of the hostess. We have a big family so they will lose out on some good business. For anyone reading this I recommend umiya sushi, prices are lower, it is less crowded and the service there is great! Doesn't hurt that their sushi is also really good :)",

I'll probably need to take a several shots of soju before you can get my ass to sing anything haha. Parking is hard to find though since this is a pretty busy popular small plaza.  Nigiri sushi here is better than most places I'e tried. I get them all seared, but that's just my personal preference of how I like my nigiri served. So many good things on the all you can eat menu that it's so hard to recommend just a few. But here are my favorites: Soft Shelled Crabs, Sexy Roll, Baked Mussels, Scallop Roll, and Bacon/Scallop Skewer.  For desserts, Almond Mocha Ice Cream is very good but kinda of a bummer that they don't have Tempura Ice Cream.",

    "text": "The only nice thing I can say about this place is that the decor is cute. Most of the rolls that I ordered were pretty much California rolls mixed with a little bit of something else, which I did not like.  I would have not ordered those rolls if I had known they contained the CA roll. The amount of fish they give is very very little.  Do not order the Big Mac. It's a huge roll mainly of rice mixed in with CA roll and TINY slice of either salmon or tuna.  Do not get anything with spicy tuna here! It is disgusting. This includes the Kaya roll.  Maybe that day it was not fresh, but it was truly nasty. It had a very weird taste that probably should not even be served.  I would probably just stick to their cooked foods such as the skewers and the bbq.  Really, this place is for novices who can only handle CA rolls.    If you want service, this place is not it.  It took a long time to get everything. Actually, I believe we didn't even get all the food that we ordered.  I believe they do this on purpose to prevent from over-ordering or something.  I think they purposely brought out the food slowly so we would get full soon.  The servers were not attentive at all. We asked the servers several times to get a setup.  There weren't that many people there when we were being served.  It took a good 15 minutes for our bill to come out when we asked for it.    Oh yeah and you can only get a half roll it it's your last order.  Like what kind of rule is that!?!?   Overall, I've had much better AYCE elsewhere.  At 22 bucks a pop, this place is not worth it.",

    "text": "As I was singing along to Shy Boy by Secret, I kind of found myself in a bit of a surprised state, am I eating at a Korean Restaurant or a Sushi joint? There really isn't much to say about this place, but I'll state the Pros and Cons of my first experience here at Sushi Kaya.   Pros: -AYCE for $19.99. So decently priced -We were seated immediately upon entering and our orders were taken. -The place is clean, roomy and open late. I believe till 3a.  -Karaoke available here! -The rice used on the sushi is really A+, not too sticky or vinegary.  -Minimal use of yum yum/teriyaki sauces (a con if you like the sauces)  -A lot of avocado used in the rolls (Loooove Avocado)  -Soju is served here!!!! -Appetizers here are Japanese and Korean combination. Few of my favorites being the Kim Chi fried rice, Dukkbokki (good flavor, but the rice cakes seems quickly pan fried so it had sort of a crunch on the outside) and the no rice roll, which was a ball of spicy tuna with shrimp tempura in the middle and topped with avocado.  -the only ROLL that was Great is the Kaya Roll.   Cons: -Nigiri sushi selections were pretty good. It's hit or miss with the quality of the fish. Some orders were really good, and some other (same) orders later seemed kinda off.  -They were taking your orders frequently, but it seemed more often than the food ever came out. We would wait for our food, but instead of steady plates coming out, they'd bring it out all at once.  -for the Rolls, there was a lot of cream cheese and avocado selections. it seemed like almost all the rolls had either cream cheese or avocado or both. there wasn't much variety for the rolls.  -for the skewers, you were only allowed one each person or something like that, so we were only allowed to have one type of skewer each. :(( The beef tongue skewer was sort of flavorless anyways.  -Parking is really hard to find. A small parking area.  All in all, it wasn't totally bad, but it wasn't impressive either. I'd come back here again, but it wouldn't be my first, second or third choice. I'm still on a sushi hunt!!!   Sayonara or Annyeong Haseyo!",

A lot of the good items on the menu can only be ordered once, but the children cannot even order these items. The menu stated to order a little at a time which we are perfectly fine with; however since the portions were so small we had to reorder consistently. Apparently the servers only wanted us to order once at an this all you can eat because they kept giving us attitude and saying \"anything else\" while rolling their eyes, which insinuated they didn't want us to order anymore. In the middle of the dinner (30 whole minutes!) they then dropped off the check. By no means are my family and I hefty eaters, but we do eat a little more at a supposed all you can eat, so I don't want to feel like a pig for ordering more food!

I liked how the hostess gave us another seating option since we were already waiting half an hour, and the only way we could all sit together would be another 30 min wait. At least we were seated across from each other. So me and all the girls we at the bar and the guys were at the table across from us. My brother didn't really like how even tho we got split up and were clearly 2 separate groups they still charged us gratuity because there was 6 of us all together. I understand where he's coming from cause where he works they don't charge it when the group gets split and what not, but their policies are different. Anyways I really enjoyed it there and they have a lot of things I liked since I'm pretty picky about sushi. And I do like how they have stamp cards so after so many times eating there I'll get a free meal. I'll most definitely be back again :)",

The sushi rolls were good, but portions and the rolls were small.   After having a wonderful time and great conversation, my cousin pointed to \"something\" crawling behind my bench. Needless to say, a friendly ROACH paid us a visit. I stopped eating as I felt sick to my stomach. We asked for the check as quickly as possible. I WILL NOT BE BACK. They need to spray that entire restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was so disappointed. 1 star for the cockroach! :(",

But the pork belly there is sometimes worth it. I love the scallop bacon skewer, but its too bad we only get one serving on the package. We loved the white Vegas roll . Service is fast and dishes are delivered promptly. The hostess was very sweet and accommodated a more comfortable table and moved us over to a larger table. I just don't like the lighting it needs to be a little more dim. I just got out of work and honey it was a hard night. There are still many other dishes I would like to try. I liked the cherry amaretto ic much better than the mochis. Although it being super busy, we were seated in a minute and I love that. Check it out",

The price is a pretty good deal. $19.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner and that includes a list of special rolls, appetizers, nigiri, and even dessert.   The service has actually gotten very polite, friendly, and fast since my first visit which is why I'm giving them another star.   The sushi may not be the BEST in town, but it's definitely good and the appetizers are even better.   I really like that this place gives out a stamp card; it's a big incentive to keep coming back. The restaurant is also very nice and clean, which is always a plus. Whenever I bring visitors from out of town here, they're really impressed because it's hard to find places that do ayce sushi along with appetizers in SoCal.   I'm glad this place has improved since my first visit. I'll be sure to keep coming back.",

    "text": "I ve passed this spot plenty of times but never stopped by .always read the reviews but decided to skip it until last week where I ventured inside.  Service was great. We got sat right away and decided to sit down at the sushi bar, where we thought we will be ordering directly from our chefs . To our surprise we were not allowed to? What the deuce !!? This was very weird. Are they protecting the chefs and their magnificent sushi ninja secrets? Do I look like a sushi chef killer Come on..I appreciate them serving me fast and refilling my drinks right away but if I sit at the sushi bar and the chef is right next to me, I should be allowed to order from him.  Place is big and clean. Seems to be a good spot for groups too. Nice comfy looking booth and a nice waiting area as well. Lighting is good as well .In general the ambiance is pretty nice. Now..what Im gonna say some of you may not like. But there were no Japanese employees.I understand that most places are Korean owned/managed, but at least lie to me and hire one Japanese person. Its like going to a Peruvian restaurant that is run and managed by Colombians..yes we look alike but we are not the same.  Food is good. The appetizer menu is extensive and their poke salad has big chunks of tuna which is a win in my book.The soft shell crab was delicious. Very well cooked ! Rolls don't fall into the \"damn that's a roll or rice ball\" category so that's another good sign for me as well. I lie the fact that the nigiri doesn't pack that much rice either. Lots of sushi places make this mistake, however Kay packs the nigiri with a good amount of fish.  Will this be my next favorite spot? No, would I come back? yep..if im in the area. There is nothing spectacular in the menu that would make me want to return despite the distance, however it is very good..hard to explain but that is just a personal opinion. The food is good, the price is average and the service Is great. Only thing missing is that IT factor, which makes me decide if I should drive far for a restaurant or not.  Fear not readers..my chase for the holy grail of sushi will not be done anytime soon",

    "text": "Our friend wanted sushi and this was the close that was open at the time we went with the highest stars on Yelp.  We decided to come here.  We all were really excited to try this spot out.  Parking is a little out of control here, lots of businesses and very small lot.  We got lucky and found one spot completely opposite of where the restaurant was.  We walked around the building and saw they offer AYCE here.  My friends were super excited since they were starving.  We walked in, I thought it was weird no one greeted us coming in.  We were standing there a few minutes before the hostess sat us down at the sushi bar since there was no more tables.  Well there were tables, I guess those section weren't open or something.  We tried to sit down and there was rice on one of our seat.  I had to grab the hostess to clean it up since there was no napkin around.  We were ready to order and no server has even came by to us yet.  Every time we needed something, we have to hunt down a server.  Basically the service is non existence here.    The food was ok, They didn't have a lot of fresh sashimi dished that comes with AYCE menu like how other places do.  A lot of their rolls are really similar to other rolls, just one of two things different or how they prepared it.  It wasn't all that bad.  I did remember there was one dish that was really, really good, I think it was called the Sex Bomb Roll and everything else is whatever.  We were done within an hour for our late lunch.  We got the check, the server came and told us that since it's our first time.  She's not going to charge us for the leftover.  The leftover was what I ordered.  I'm allergic to soy, which means I can't have any soy product in my food.  I have to order all of my food with ponzu, ell, and soy sauce on the side just in case someone else wanted to try the dish.  The chef forgot and added ponzu sauce on a couple of dishes I ordered for myself and my friends didn't want to eat it.  I didn't order anymore because I felt bad throwing food away, but I definitely would have eat it, if I wasn't allergic to it.  I definitely would fight this if she was going to charge me for something that was made incorrectly.    They do charge here if you don't finish your food.  Service sucks.  Food ended up not so great, two of us got really sick after eating here.  We were the two eating almost all the same things.  Our other friend ate 3-4 dish different than we did.  After that experience....NO THANK YOU!",

They even have a punch card system which shows how much I go there because I've already used 3 free AYCE!!! The customer service is good. They're always nice and talkative, even cracking jokes here and there. They also refill the water quite frequently, you don't have to ask! The quality of the food is really good. My favorite roll is the crunch roll. Their baked and deep fried rolls are really good too. They do half and full size servings. Their bacon wrapped asparagus is sooooo delicious.

However, there are certain items that limit one order per person just like the skewers.  My all time top orders are: Kim Chee fried rice, Pot stickers (fyi it's not called Gyoza. I keep saying \"Gyoza\" and they look at me like ?!), and last \"Spicy Tuna Handroll\" shit is bomb. com!  What's cool about Sushi Kaya is they do half rolls which comes in 4pcs vs a full roll  that is 8 pcs, so that way you can try the rolls without having the feeling of \"fcuk why did I order so much!\" haha. And the prices is cheap! Compared to most sushi spots that charges $25+tax. Sushi Kaya lunch cost is $19.99 (until 4pm) and then $22.95 (4pm till late). Plus, they do stamp cards (think the 10th one is free).   I don't care what anyone else thinks about sushi kaya. I'm a huge fan!

Then at the end of the transaction they took like an automatic 5 or 10% out for gratuity! I wanted to choose if I wanted to tip or not and they kind of forced me to pay that extra little bit of money. Then they charged another dollar or so to use your card! It says that on the receipt (at the bottom) but not big enough in my opinion. They need a sign or something saying they charge to use your card. My meal just seemed to keep racking up a more and more of a bill which seemed odd to me. Also they had like a 90 min table limit!! Which is crazy! I understand maybe an eating limit so ppl don't stay there forever for the all you can eat sushi but jeez we had to vacate the table, and we had more people joining later that couldn't even eat because we had to leave. The food was pretty good but I don't think I'll be back. If you want a good place for sushi and don't care about budget, this is the place to go.",

If you like a nosy restaurant where they watch how much you eat or can not eat and do not mind to be treated with attitude, go to this place. I will NEVER go back !!!",

    "text": "Me and a few friends decided to go to a this place based on the reviews it seemed pretty decent. I don't eat sushi too much but everyone I was with loves it, they assured me there would be other options besides seafood, which there was.   I ended up opting out of the all you can eat as it was $27 and I wasn't too hungry. So I got some chicken fried rice and two skewers, the food was okay at best, definitely not the best I have ever had. The beef was pretty fatty.   My biggest complaint has to be the portions of food, I ended up paying $15 roughly for less food than I would have received somewhere else much, much cheaper.   To top all of this off the customer service was absolutely appalling, the lady who was taking my order laughed at me for a question I asked about the food. I apologize that I'm not a sushi aficionado and had a question. We needed refills on our drinks and no one had come by to ask us, they were nowhere to be found after we placed the first round order of food in an attempt to clearly kill the time limit they place on the all you can eaters. Disgusting business practices.  I can safely assume that I will never be coming to this restaurant again. As well as never recommending this place to a single person I meet unless I don't like the person. There are many other sushi joints in Vegas that are far superior to this one. If it was possible I would have given them 0/5 stars.",

The first time I came here was by accident when my friends and I were super hungry and just pointed to the place. Random.   Anyways, lunch is around $20 a person. They apparently have a 90 min limit to eat according to the menu, but I'm not sure if they enforce it. You have to eat everything so if you don't think you can, order half portions!   I tried several of their rolls and most of their nigiri. The fish is reasonably fresh and I always want to come back for more! 10 orders of salmon? Sure! 5 orders of eel! That totally hits the spot. You can also get your order of skewers, noodles, etc.   I always end the meal with a mochi ice cream as well as regular ice cream! Green tea is the way to go! Yum!   Sushi Kaya, I'll be back when I'm in Vegas!",

Therefore, I went in with extremely low expectations and was proven WRONG!  We got our name on the list and after 40 minutes I was given a call. The wait was as expected but there is a tea shop right next to the sushi place and had a boba while we waited. Our waiter was helpful and suggested a few things. We ended up not going with the all you can eat, which is what she suggested. We had a party of 6. Our bill only came up to 55 and that was with the 15% tip included. We order 6 different types of roll and shared between everyone. We enjoyed a lot of the rolls, yet we choose them with a preference of familiarity with the ingredients. We stayed away from the foreign (to us) described items.   It was enjoyable. The atmosphere was very intimate with dimmed lights, of Asia decent paintings and decorations, and spacious. We all fit comfortably in a booth. There was also a sushi bar for faster service.",

Not as good as Goyemon.  First off, me and my friend sit down and instantly a waitress comes over and asks what we are drinking. We had not had a chance to look at the drink menu, so we reply \"water.\" She whisks the drink menu away, so even if I had wanted to order a different drink later we wouldn't have been able to.  I didn't order AYCE because I am trying to not be a fatass. I ordered miso soup, three types of nigiri (tamago, salmon and ikura.) I also ordered a spicy tuna roll. I gotta give it to them, they give you A LOT of sushi for the price. Usually, you'll get two pieces of nigiri per order. Here, I got three (except for the ikura.) They are cheaply priced (don't know anywhere else that you can get ikura for $3.50 per order.) I was glad I did not order AYCE because of the amount I received--I would not have been able to eat more than that. There was a lot of rice, and the spicy tuna roll came with like 9 pieces. Quality of the fish was meh. My bill came out to around $20. AYCE is $25--but I would have regretted eating so much. Check took FOREVER to come and we weren't able to flag down our original waitress.  When you come in, they greet you in Korean. However, I thought this place was supposed to be Japanese based on the name. Sushi Kaya: Identity Crisis?  This place was PACKED on a random Thursday evening (many people waiting outside) so plan accordingly!",

Although I still wonder how come this place is never packed when we go. But I ain't gonna complain because then that means we don't have to wait.  I wish we had something like this in LA. We do, but this one is better. You get an ice cream dessert for in all you can eat sushi!  Ever since we found this place, it's becoming a tradition (for me at least) to hit up this spot whenever we're in Vegas. This ain't no Todai... where they leave the sushi sitting for hours. It's made to order. And, this owns all buffets on the strip. I love me some sushi! They also have skewers on the list.  The sushi is fresh. The mackerel and ono just melts in your mouth. And just the variety of rolls you can choose from... it's insane. Even better around lunch time when it's only $19.95. You really get a stretch for dollah dolla bills, and some more. Oh and they let you eat for 2 hours whereas in some places they only give you an  hour limit. Even if you've been there for two hours... they weren't really anal about it that they'll kick you out.  And did you know they have a punch card? Free AYCE after (I believe) 10 visits (something like that). If I lived closer... I'll probably get my freebie at the end of the month.",

I got on Yelp and looked up some all you can eat sushi restaurants and we finally decided on  Sushi Kaya for it's price of only $25 a person for AYCE sushi, and it doesn't close till 3am! Perfect for our late nights :)    Located right next to Anime Ramen, once you walk in to the restaurant you see the splendid Japanese/Korean decor, and the atmosphere of the place is just great!  Next to come was the hostess who took us to our seats without us having to wait a few minutes or more, which was awesome because I just got off of work and I was starving. The servers were so sweet and attentive, didn't have any problem getting their attention or asking for their advice. They did a really good job at keeping our drinks filled and checking up on us to see if we needed anything else.    Now we get to the sushi- DELICIOUS! They offer full rolls, and half rolls, and have soooo many selections to choose from. My favorites were the Lasagna Roll, the Salmon Fashion, and the Sex Bomb. I'm a petite person and can't fit too much into my stomach- but I most definitely plan on going back soon to try more!    I, along with the bf and the roommate, would recommend this place time and time again. Can't wait for the next visit!",

Their food is just so good and pretty inexpensive (like $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner...) I love their shrimp/garlic skewer, baked green mussels, the mochi ice-cream! Sushi rolls are I think got a bit too much rice and fillers but overall it's still decent.",

Anyways, ordered the AYCE deal at the lunch price (cheaper than dinner).  Sushi and rolls were pretty good considering AYCE and less than $20 and it includes ice cream.  Place was busy so I felt like the wait to get my orders was a bit long. Overall, I was very pleased.  I was so hungry and craved sushi.  Why do I oftentimes eat only one meal a day when I'm in Vegas?  If I had gone to a regular sushi joint and ordered the same amount of food, my bill would be about a $100 (5 times what I paid here).  Would I come back?  Most likely but I definitely want to try the other AYCE joints here in Vegas first.",

    "text": "I give props to the atmosphere, and friendly staff(Although when its busy they may take awhile to check up on you). Parking is a terror, as Kaya is in one of the most popular plaza's of Chinatown, but yet very small. I suggest parking over at the main Chinatown plaza and just don't get caught walking over lol. But definitely do not expect high quality and authentic sushi at this place. instead, expect highly bastardized sushi. But if you don't mind that, then Sushi Kaya is an alright place for AYCE. The quality of the sushi rolls were terrible, when I picked up my sushi, they were doused in sauce and came falling apart. It was as if they flimsily put together an abundance of rice, small portions of fish and fillings, and disproportional sizes of rolls. The nigiri were alright though. I don't have much to say, as it wasn't that fabulous, but it also wasn't terrible.  Now onto the the good of this place! If you do some here, I suggest trying their skewers and appetizers! As well as trying some of the Korean dishes they offer. Although I did not enjoy how crappy my rolls were made, the spicy rolls were pretty flavorful and tasty. If you like spicy, its worth it to at least try. One thing I like about this AYCE place is that dessert is all you can eat as well! Which some other AYCE places don't offer at all. Sushi Kaya is not my first choice for AYCE, but its good as a last resort as its open pretty late. Definitely take time to try other AYCE options in town.",

The price is lower (by a few dollars) than many other places, the food quality and selection of rolls is far superior, and AYCE includes so many different appetizers (edamame, potstickers) and mochi (!!).  The servers are always so attentive and kind. I rarely have to ask for a water refill because they do it so frequently and placing the sushi order is quick and easy. Wait time can be slightly long but if you go during off times (early afternoon during lunch, late afternoon before dinner starts) it's not so bad. My recommendations for rolls: sexy, nemo, bonzai, royal California.",

Their sushi offerings are more with fun and exotic selections. Their sushi is fresh as well. I ordered the Viagra Roll for the deep fried selection which was delish; the Ultimate Albacore roll which was also recommended; and the Rainbow roll. Their hand roll was also amazing which i think you should order also at least once. Then we ordered the usual yellowtail, albacore, white tuna, etc...  Great tip is to eat the sushi upside down so taste the fish first, which I never knew you should do. Awesome AYCE sushi deal for $26.",

Rolls were average, nothing special. Kimchi fried rice was bomb! We came in around 1am and service was fast and attentive. The AYCE last call is @ 2:15am.  There's a one per person limit on the mochi ice cream. The green tea cheesecake is absolutely to die for so make sure you order one!! :)",

The service was prompt and we were taken care of very well by various members of the wait staff.   The sushi selection was quite large and for all you can eat I was pleased with the menu.   Our sushi came out just about as fast as we could order it and I was very happy with the quality of the sushi.   If you come I highly recommend the smoke salmon nigiri.",

    "text": "I've pulled up to Sushi Kaya several times, only to be turned away by the hour + wait. People flock here for their AYCE menu, and convenient location (although the parking lot can be a bit of a nightmare). I was FINALLY able to walk in on a Thursday night around 7pm last week, which might be the trick, because when we left around 9 there were people waiting around the corner.   We opted for the AYCE menu which I believe was about 26.95 a pop, and is definitely the way to go since rolls start at like 11.95 and nigiri can range from 6.95-9.95. There are limitations of course, only 1 order of sweet shrimp and uni per person, no sashimi, and you must eat all the rice or you'll get charged for leftovers. I wasn't blown away by the flavor or quality, but it wasn't horrible either. The halibut and salmon belly were the best, but the tuna and yellowtail etc. all have a way of blending in together sometimes. I tried mackerel for the first time....pass. Way too fishy. Uni was subpar, I've had better at Spicy Tuna. If there isn't a wait I'd head in at 2am, but don't line up expecting the best sushi meal of your life unless you're the kind to order cream cheese rolls and lemon drops.",

My idea of a good sushi place is somewhere with FRESH raw fish, as in sashimi and nigiri.  I always do AYCE, and the nigiri is a perfect ratio of fish to rice.  They don't overdo it on the rice, so you don't get full that fast.  I always order salmon, halibut, yellowtail, and red snapper.  I am never disappointed. The fish melts in your mouth.  Not fishy tasting.  Try their garlic ponzu, it's a very nice addition.  I'm not sure if other restaurants offer this special type of ponzu.  Don't listen to the other reviewers who obviously prefer a deep fried California roll over real fish.",

We were in there without light and AC and try to wait for the power back, the we can pay [paying by card]. We waited there at least 45mins, then we tried to talk to the manager and see what can we do to solve that, but the Asian manager's attitude is rude. Since we don't have cash, and we are not from local, so we try ask them is anyone have chase bank there then we can transfer money to them.  And the manager just keep saying i am giving you option have to choose either one to do, you guys either leave ur actual cell phone and ID here or wait here until the power is back!!!!!  AT THE END one of the staff helped us to solve that, used his personal bank to take our money! I think the guy called CHANCE! Really nice!

We had paid for the room but the staff was being extremely rude about the fact that a few of the people were running late. They wouldn't serve us and threatened to kick us out before our prepaid hour was even up (or barely started for that matter). Now, I am not going to say we didn't get a little loud (there was 12 of us) BUT that's why we had gotten our own room! The servers coming in and out would rarely shut the door.  We would order food with one person and sometimes it would never come and when we would ask why, we were told we were wrong.   Now time to pay the bill for the food (room was already paid for the time beforehand). They SHORT my boyfriend $20 by saying he did not put the money in when I watched him do it! It was $40 for us both (tip included). They come back and make him pay another $20.   We say screw it whatever because we are still celebrating a birthday in the group. Mind you, none of the staff says anything else to us, not even when we were outside for about 20 minutes afterwards taking a few photos and setting up a meeting spot.   After we leave the parking lot, the friend who paid for the room gets a call from there. They tell him we are nkt allowed back! That we were roudy, rude, and racist! In no way were we any of that! When my friend protests he also demands they check the video of the room to see what happened with my boyfriend's money. Of course they say nothing looks wrong. Funny how they didn't want to tell us that while we were there.  I will never trust this place or ever suggest this place to anyone sheerly on the poor customer service and the blatant lying to make a quick buck.  But hey, eat here if someone else is taking you because the food ain't terrible. Just don't waste your own money.",

I have to write this sad review because we went there for lunch on 3/6/16 with a group of 6 of us.  We ordered quite a variety - the rolls, skewers, nigiri of all sorts, seaweed salad, etc.    HERE'S MY FOOD POISONING STORY:  Unfortunately the next day at midnight I started throwing up, and I had a very high fever.  I didn't know it, (I thought I had a really bad hangover) but I had food poisoning.  I was throwing up water until 5am and had the hot sweats from having a fever.  I could barely stay asleep and I was out the entire day on Tuesday, missing my convention.    After I was finally better, I found out the rest of my group had food poisoning too - SIX OF US. one of my friends decided to drive home earlier because he couldn't hold it down from both ends.  A few others were nauseous, and the others were taking Pepto Bismol.    One of my friends said they noticed the sushi wasn't as cold when they ate it, and that could be the reason.  I don't know, but it's really unfortunate as this was my favorite AYCE sushi place to go to.",

The rolls utilize a lot of tempura shrimp, dressed up California rolls, and cream cheese, but the good picks are very decent. I also liked that you can order half rolls so you can cover more of the menu.   If you have a car or are willing to uber ($10ish each way from the south end of the Strip) then this is a good swap for one of the big hotels' sushi restaurants.",

    "text": "My son and I had a 3-day vacation in Vegas. After having a lot of buffet lunches and dinners, we decided to eat something lighter and less fattening on the last night in Vegas.  Hence, we decided to go to Sushi Kaya for sushi rolls. They have an all-you-can-eat dinner for $24 per person.  This was a lot cheaper than the buffet lunches and dinners we had before.  As we had eaten a lot of food in the previous two days and nights, even the $24 all-you-can-eat dinner was too much for our appetites.  That's why we ordered sushi rolls a la carte.  Each sushi roll costs around $12.    The Latino lady who served us turned her face contemptuous when we went for a la carte \"against\" her wish for all-you-can-eat.  As soon as we finished the last count of sushi rolls, she came forward to ask us \"are you still waiting for something\".  We still had our full glasses of beverages not yet consumed!!!  She even brought us the check although we are not ready to check out.  We were still drinking the beverages, reading the dessert menu and would like to place an order for ice cream.  She reluctantly took the check back.  We had never met any servers so rude in any restaurants.  Even fast food restaurants such as McDonald's and In-N-Out Burgers don't push their customers to leave after they finish their meals,  let alone the fact that we still had our beverages on the table!  When she first took her liberty to bring the check to us, we had been there in Kaya for only 20 to 25 minutes!  It was 10 pm on a week night when they still had a few unoccupied tables.  We're not taking up their valuable space or having an extended stay there.  Why this Latino lady was so keen on getting rid of us decent customers?  On the other hand, the other waiters and waitresses who are Japanese or Chinese were very nice to us.  They asked us to refill our drinks.  What was wrong with the Latino lady?   I think she thought we could not afford the $24 dinner there, and therefore she behaved so rude.  In fact, with the sushi rolls, miso soup, beverages and ice cream we ordered, the total bill was close to 2 all-you-can-eat dinners the Latino lady cherished.  So, what is wrong with her mentally?   Well, she did not notice that my watch alone is worth more than her annual salary. The money I donated to charities can buy her a new car to replace her piece of junk in parking lot.   Frankly speaking, the quality of this lady is worse than the Latino cleaning ladies in my company.  The Latino cleaning ladies in my company are very hard working, polite and nice.  I don't see these qualities in this Latino waitress lady.  I don't know why Sushi Kaya hire such uncaring rude person as their employee to serve their valued customers.  I believe she could be a spy from Kaya's competitor to hurt Kaya's business and bottomline.",

It sucks bc I've been coming here for my birthday for the last 4 years and never had a problem.

My favorite specialty sushi roll was the \"Sex bomb\" great complex flavors; especially with the eel and salmon. I loved the beef, shrimp and beef tongue skewers. The other top contenders: Seaweed salad, fried tempura mixed was fried to perfect, can't go wrong with the salmon nigiri- taste fresh and not frozen. I had a few rolls which I didn't like and unfortunately I can't recall what they were. When I told one of the staff I didn't like these rolls, I had the most nastiest glance. I was like ugh..OKAAYY..

    "text": "I'm going to preface this with the fact I've been to this restaurant before and had pretty much an average experience nothing extraordinary. However last night me and some friends decided to eat some late night sushi. There aren't many in town so our choice was pretty clearly going to be Sushi Kaya. Upon being seated we were quickly asked what we'd like to drink, most servers would typically ask each individual what they'd like. This server heard one person say water and ran off saying \"Waters all around then!\" Most of our table was confused but brushed it off as just a miscommunication. Next we began to order, nothing too out of the ordinary there, until we had ordered our second round of Salmon Nigiri. Our order was delivered to us and as they set it down they said \"Salmon Nigiri and Smoked Salmon Nigiri\". I'm not a fan of smoked salmon nor were any of my friends. So we asked why we got smoked salmon to the same server that told us it was smoked salmon. So she took the plate, we assume to ask a chef, and returns with the same plate saying it's just salmon nigiri. We try it and it's definitely smoked salmon. We then ask the same server that \"took care\" of our drinks about the smoked salmon and in a unhappy way took the plate and didn't really apologize or say anything regarding the mistake. Finally we finish our meal and ask for the check. Upon receiving the check my girlfriend notices that we were being charged the 18% gratuity for a group of 5 when their policy is 6 or more have added gratuity. We ask one of the servers if this is a mistake and they proceed to ask several other people who say that the gratuity is \"supposed to be there\". The server then approaches our \"amazing\" drink server about the added gratuity and she confidently states that it is supposed to be there. We of course dispute this that they aren't honoring their policy and should remove this discrepancy. She then folds and takes the checks and removes the gratuity. Upon arriving with our correct checks she throws them down aggressively and disingenuously says have a good night and leaves. Of course after an experience like that where she forces things upon us such as drink orders and added gratuity, my friends and I are never planning to come back and left her a nice healthy $0.10 tip for her \"amazing\" service.",

There's plenty of parking, maybe like 60-80 spots, but they are still not enough when the restaurant is at peak business, so you might have to driving in circles a few times. Unfortunately most of the time it's first come first serve without reservation unless you have like a lot of people on your party, then they might accommodate.   When you finally get inside, they have what seems like a million servers always running around checking on everyone. They called our name, and seated us after about a 30 minute wait during peak Friday at night. Immediately someone asked us what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order. Drinks yes, food not yet.   When they came back in a few minutes we started ordering half rolls and nigiri. Half roll portions are the way we do because if it doesn't taste like you thought, it's only 4 pieces, as opposed to 8. Kaya has a rule if you waste too much they'll charge ya extra for it.   Anyway all the rolls were delicious and the wait after ordering a roll is like 5-10 minutes, extremely fast & fresh. Now one thing to note is, most rolls have a lot of seasoning on them yum yum sauce, ponzu, spicy etc. so if you're a purest and just want nigiri, it might not be what you're looking for. For me I love the spicy yum yum sauce and colorful display :).   Overall excellent service, speedy food preparation and really tasty sushi options. Not cheap on the weekends, but when the stomachs happy, the wallet doesn't care!",

    "text": "Not only does Sushi Kaya offer incredibly fresh all you can eat sushi, but they also have an extensive menu that includes anything from ginger salad and spicy edamame to curry rice and mochi ice cream. Basically you are getting all you can eat appetizers, entrees, and desserts for one low price.   There are two vegetarian sushi rolls on the menu and they are both very tasty. But again, given the depth of the menu, you will find plenty of vegetarian options in addition to the sushi to make a visit to Sushi Kaya worth it.  This might not be the best place to get sushi if you are gluten free. They do not have a gluten free menu, and you'll really have to sift through the speciality rolls to find any that don't contain gluten in some form or another (sauces, imitation crab, tempura batter, etc). They do not have gluten free soy sauce. If you are really careful about ordering, you might be able to make Sushi Kaya work. At least the mochi ice cream should be gluten free.",

The lunch hour definitely fills up so beware of a possible 20 minute wait time.   Food: For the most part tasty and fresh. The nigiri is probably the best bang for your buck! The sushi rolls are good as well though and i recommend the skewers!   Rolls: Cinderella, Amigo, Sexy, Monkey Brains, Crispy Rice, Jupiter, Sex Bomb, Dancing Eel, White Vegas, Evergreen, Wall Street, and Brooklyn are my go-to rolls.  Nigiri: yellowtail, yellowtail, yellowtail it is sooo good and fresh!   Check out the bowls too when you first get there, they take 15  minutes so you'll want to order them first. They're not a full size just a nice mini personal or two personal sampler size.   Service: The staff changes very often, it's rare we get the same server for long but they're all very nice and we've always received fast service.",

My mom was visiting and she is a sushi lover, took her there and we had the worst experience. Literally the only thing offered to us was the table. After waiting 20 minutes or longer we saw a server and requested menus, he left and forgot about us, next server around asked if we had decided, only then we had a chance to request menus. The second server took our order and was not able to bring the correct drinks, she brought me ice tea after I had requested green hot tea and of course the wrong soda for my mom. When the food came we had to ask for condiments and chopsticks because those never came before the food. The sushi looked dry, had little flavor and the presentation was falling in-front of our eyes, truly embarrassing for a place of high reputation. It was noticeable how a restaurant gains reputation and the quality falls. It was not even busy to justify the slow and low quality service, we did not even had all you can eat, we ordered specific dishes and left a tip out of curtesy. The hostess had a smile and was friendly.",

It isn't top top notch but only because we are nowhere near an ocean. There is an item on the menu named WHO IS YOUR DADDY? and if you know the answer to that, I say you're doing better than most. Cap off your blossoming stomach ache with a mango or strawberry mochi ball (they're mind benders) and some green tea ice cream.",

I can honestly say service has gone downhill. I don't know if it's the new management or ?? But both times we went recently, I was surprised they lowered the price but then I realized why. One of the times we kept getting another tables rolls and we had to flag our waiter that we didn't order that. Another time they took so long to bring the check back when it wasn't so busy. And the food isn't what it used to be, the poke isn't the same. I can't quite put my finger on it but it just wasn't it. Both times I've gone they've been \"out of bacon & scallop\". The first time I was like \"ok we are here late maybe they ran out.\" But this time it was around early dinner time, same thing. If you're not going to have something anymore why not update the menu? Menus could sure use an update. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while too. Idk this spot lost its touch, kinda disappointed.",

The menu includes a wide assortment of salad, soup, appetizers, sashimi, nigiri, and a TON of specialty rolls. Everything is prepared pretty quickly and the quality is good especially for the price you pay. The server we had was a bit standoffish and didn't really check back often to see if we wanted to order more, but we definitely didn't leave hungry! The grilled skewers and dynamite appetizer are a must, but skip the calamari and pot stickers. Thenrolls were really creative and tasty as well. We favored the Washington roll and the One Night Stand roll. The octopus nigiri was a little off tasting, but not bad enough to not eat. Overall, a good experience and worth trying. We wished there was more of a sashimi selection and brown rice as a sushi option. Again, no huge deal as there is lots to choose from!",

Always try to make reservations, because their waiting area is very tiny! Which is understandable, I rather have a small waiting area and more tables than vice versa.    Service is a hit or miss! Usually when it's lunch time and not busy, the service is right on. I wish I could have put in a good word for our server, but I don't believe that they have name tags (darn). Anyways, our waitress with the short hair was so attentive! She always asked us if we wanted to order more and always checked up on us, which is odd because that never happened the last 5 times I was here.   For an AYCE restaurant, the quality of the fish was okay, it wasn't excellent though. Our yellowtail nigiri was kinda on the warm side and gross, but they are very generous with the size of the fish and amount of rice. Big piece of fish on top of a little stack of rice (perfect!) I would recommend everything on the menu, especially all the baked rolls like the Tornado and Sweety roll. The only thing I would not recommend are their baked mussels. They put way too much cheese and cook it for too long, so the cheese is all burnt and tuff (ew).",

Also love their ice cream,  plum wine and mocha almond are the best!!  $25 for dinner and $20 for lunch but you can't order sweet shrimp and sea urchin during lunch. Ask for the stamp card. They will give you a stamp for one meal. You get one free if you got 10 stamp within a year.  We go there usually before 6 pm to avoid the wait, or you may have to wait at least 30 minutes during weekends.   Just fyi - there are lots of parking spaces behind the restaurant :)  3 starts because we sat on the bar table last night and saw too much dust on the decor that was hanging on the sushi bar.

We were a group of 8, my brothers, their friends who drove from CA a few hours before, my mother and of course me, I had a flight to CO in a few hours, we spent all day at my Father's funeral service so we were all exhausted, we wanted to spend time together before everyone parted ways. I get it, it was near closing time, my brothers and his friends were loud, but the host/server had a lot of attitude. At one point, I could have sworn he said \"ok, I'll just take your fucking order\" and I darted a look at him. He was a foot away so there couldn't have been a mistake with what I heard. I did my best to say my please and thank yous to this punk. In my line of work, I have to watch people, so that's what I did. My mom got up to go somewhere, when she was walking to our table, 2 guys behind the bar, the cooks, one was a short Hispanic male &  the other was a taller, heavy set, pale, Caucasian male, hats flipped backwards, they watched her and proceeded to make comments, the heavy one shook his head in disgust and said something to the tiny one, and I stared and watched this entire conversation. The woman they made comments of spent 44 years with my now deceased father, she spent 10 years taking care of him, she spent these last couple of months feeding him and cleaning his hospital bed everytime he defecated, she did everything, we have to make her take sleeping pills so she can actually sleep. She's beautiful inside and out to me. So to these 2 young, odd looking individuals, when your loved ones pass, I hope you are as protective with them as I am with mine.   The food was okay, the chicken curry didn't have chicken in it. It wasn't impressive, the fried sushi was on the stale side. The corn tortilla for the Japanese Pizza didn't go well with the ensemble, but the rest of the \"pizza\" was tasty. Calamari was the best on the table.  It was a quick serve, fast food style. Food would have tasted better if the service and people weren't so terrible. Server didn't deserve the tip we gave him, but I'm generous.",

The menu is huge so many choices, other than sushi they have many side orders. The only problem is that some of them are limited to one order per person. Try the beef skewer, tongue and the mushroom just to name a few. These are limited but so good so be sure to order your limit.   The nigiri is always on point, hamachi, garlic tuna and super white are a must. If you like rolls try the baked Alaska its A-MAY-ZING!!!!!! They don't disappoint. When ever I come here the sushi comes out really fast and they always check back to see if we need anything.   Now depending when you come here there is a wait sometimes, just because the place is not that big and the food is awesome. So they must be doing something right. It crazy that people complain about the wait but would you rather go some where the food is bad and no one is there? All good things come to those who wait! Trust me it's worth the wait. Just eat here and make your own decision.....    Dessert is the usual Mochi ice cream, vanilla ice cream, red bean, green tea and strawberry ice cream. If you want something different try the Yuzu sorbet  it's refreshing! The mini cheesecake bites are cool, it comes with whip cream and some chocolate syrup. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!",

They do ask for a credit card to reserve it though. The AYCE includes appetizers, sushi, and dessert (everything on the laminated menu). Be careful to not waste our they could charge you. They didn't seem very strict but I wouldn't test them. Good quality and portions of fish. Sometimes places try to fill you up with rice, not this place. You can also start a rewards card with a stamp for each AYCE paid for. Once you get it filled (10 stamps) you get a free AYCE. Worth the $26 for sure!",

    "text": "HERS: The most delicious AYCE sushi in Vegas! This place is a hole in the wall and from the outside may not look appealing. Once you walk in the aesthetics of this place is very nice. They have spacious booths with nice lighting and great decor. It's definitely a comfy intimate atmosphere. The wait to eat here is usually pretty long, but it's worth it!! Offer to give them your cell number and if they are really busy, they will text or call to notify you that your table is ready. They usually have great music playing and the staff is usually friendly. Now, on to the rolls. My goodness!! The rolls here are amazing!!! The rolls are well made and don't fall apart. They are also generously filled with fish or whatever kind of roll you order(some vegetarian options) and aren't made with an excessive amount of rice like most AYCE sushi places. They also have an array of appetizers, soups, etc. $26 for all you can eat dinner and a couple dollars shorter for lunch. I'm very picky about sushi since it's one of my favorite foods and this place never disappoints. The sushi comes out very quickly unlike most sushi spots and it's always delicious. They also have a stamp card when you visit a certain number of times you get a free visit, which is amazing!! I go to this place at least once a month. And have never left disappointed.   HIS: Like she said it has a whole in the wall look but don't shy away! The wait is no joke and can be up to two hours on a busy day. Go when you have the time because it seems no matter what time we go it's packed. The service is ok and you usually have a variety of different waiters helping you throughout your time. Some nights it's great and they waste no time getting your food and others not so much. AYCE is where it's at and definitely worth every penny. Almost the entire menu is included (Uni too!) and you can get whole or half rolls of almost everything too which allows you to really try lots. As far as suggestions I'd say try the Shrek, Mistake roll, Who's Your Dad, and Something Wrong. Those are some of our favorites. Don't forget to get a stamp card and enjoy!",

I sat with empty glass of wine for about 10 min multiple times before i had to flag someone down to get me another. When i asked for a taste of a wine i was unfamiliar with i was told that they dont do that in their restaraunt and was unable to even get a good description of the flavor. At the end of the meal i was charged for 2 all you can eat dinners when my girlfriend only had a bowl of soup and an order of edamame. The server told she had an all you can eat and i had to argue to get my bill fixed. My bill was returned anf i payed the bill leaving a 10% tip to reflect the poor service. Unfortunately that is not the end. As i am getting up to leave the server runs over to my table to infor me she forgot to add a drink on and i needed to give her more money. At this point i just want to leave and pay the additional amount leaving no tip. The food was average. Exactly what you would expect from an all you can eat sushi place and i will not be returning due to the extremely poor service.",

    "text": "First off I want to say, service was friendly, professional, and fairly prompt. I have no regrets spending about $25 on this AYCE sushi place.  However, based on other Yelp reviews and the words in bold print on the menu,  I heeded the warning and finished ever single bit of food put in front of me.  In Sushi Kaya's defense, I did not test the rules about not wasting food.    I just felt uncomfortable and nervous the entire time I was there. There are too many rules and restriction---must finish food, two hour limit, items you can only order once per person.   Since I don't eat rice or much starch I was limited to skewers and appetizers, no sashimi on the menu.  Most of the skewers were meager, especially since I was only allowed to order each one, one time.  Three bucks for a dinky skewer of meat? $12.95 for rolls with catchy names. Common on! They overprice the ala carte and only \"force\" a customer to choose the AYCE.  Luckily, I deceive people because at 100 lbs,  I can eat enough to match a 200 lb, 6'2 man.   Certainly I had enough food, but if it is AYCE, I just want to walk out happy, full and feeling like I got my monies' worth at a AYCE,  instead I felt relieved I finished all the food on my plate, and feared testing my limits by trying that last skewer.  Sheesh, I feel like a child eating at my mother's house!  I've had AYCE that is more suited to my sashimi eating lifestyle. I am not going back, but I will say the menu is vast and includes dessert (which I don't eat).   You should try it, you will enjoy it...as long as you follow the rules.",

We cancelled that and ordered 6 pieces of oysters instead. After waiting 40 min. we cancelled that too and just got ice cream. Even that took half an hour. How hard is it to put a scoop of ice cream into a small cup? Ridiculous! We felt so neglected. We were here 3 hours and only got to successfully order twice (both in the first hour only). There were 5 servers last night and no one offered to refill our water. Are you kidding me?",

    "text": "Finally got to try their All You Can Eat, and I have to say its pretty delicious!  The dinner price is $22.95/person (lunch is $19.95/person), and you have 1 hour to order off the AYCE menu.  I went with my parents, and we sat at the bar so we can put the order straight to the sushi chefs.    The AYCE selection is quite nice.  It's got all the basic appetizers, nigiri, and rolls (lots and lots to choose from).  It also has a rice/noodle section where you can find varieties (fried, cold, soup) rice and noodles.  Plus a section for skewers, which you don't find at most AYCE sushi joints.  There are also a few more things on the menu the usual AYCE sushi places don't have with this restaurant being a japanese/korean fushion style i.e. korean cooked beef.  The service was fast, the food was delicious, since we sat at the sushi bar, we actually got to meet the owner, and he comped us a few items that was not on the menu (scores!), for example the hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail)  Here's the list of things we devoured (from what i can still remember): Edomame - served warmed and salted, very good! Seaweed Salad - delish strings of seaweed seasoned just right Lettus Wrap - pieces of tuna sashimi, seasoned imitaton crab, avocado slices, cucmber and carrot strips all wrapped up in a lettus cup, so refreshing, kinda like a california roll minus the rice! Tuna Poke - good size chunks of tuna sashimi dressed in sauce and served on a bed of seaweed salad, very fresh and refreshing Mixed Tempura - hot off the frier mix of tempura with 3 or 4 shrimps, squid rings and legs, and a good mix of tempura vegitables Grilled Hamachi Kama - large piece of bone-in yellow tail chin grilled to perfect yumminess, mmm mmm Hamachi Nigiri - pretty standard, nothing worth mentioning OMG Roll - your basic california roll topped with chunks of salmon and tuna sashimi dressed in creamy saunce mixed with fish roe, thumbs up! Beef Skewer - juicy tender beef Bacon wrapped shrimp skewer - charred shrimps and bacon, great flavor Spicy Rice cake skewer - sweet, spicy, crispy, chewy, YUM Mushroom skewer - mushroom cooked to juicy perfection Oyster on half shell - i didn't have any but my friend said its fresh  they have so much more on the menu, i encourage everyone to check it out!",

And there is always a long line no matter the night or time.  It's the best place in town for fresh all-you-can-eat sushi.  We arrived around 9:40pm and waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar.  The sushi is the perfect portion with right amount of rice and fish, temperature hot miso soup (like all Asians I hate lukewarm soup), tasty seaweed salad, and good tempura including sweet potato.  And my favorite Japanese beer - Asahi which is the measuring stick on whether it's a genuine sushi joint.  Something I learned while traveling in Japan.  Every sushi place carries Sapporo or Kirin, but a real sushi house also carries Asahi.  Call me a beer snob.  Service is always friendly and superb.  And your sushi arrives within 10 minutes after the order is placed.  Don't forget to try the \"I Love My Ass\" roll and thank me later.",

If you aren't into raw fish, there's many other options as well, such as jalapeno poppers, skewers, noodles and tempura.   I had a couple of rolls with cilantro sauce on this most recent visit.

So, if you're looking for an opinion on their eats...I wouldn't know, we never got to that part.  A friend of mine and I were driving around Chinatown on a last minute whim to find a sushi bar to grab a quick bite before meeting up with more friends later in the evening. We walked in and were greeted and seated and asked for our drink order, we only opted for some water to start since we had been driving all around town for a good hour and a half or so. Two tables were at play and we were the third, in the middle. Our waters came to us promptly but after that the wait staff that seemed to have consisted of three females and one male (maybe he was the manager that night) pulled an epic fail move. We had decided what we wanted to order and filed our menus at the edge of the table (this is an indication that you're ready to order, no?). We sat and watched us be completely ignored. After much frustration I saw one of the waitresses walk over our way, made eye to eye contact with her...she stopped between our table and the table on the other side of us, the minute she saw money sitting on the table on the next side of us she decided it was more important to pick up her $3 tip and walk over to the other waitresses and have a gigglefest over who-knows-what. It was then that my friend and I decided to leave.  Clearly this place does not get yelped about their awesome customer service to begin with, so if it ain't broke why fix it, right?  This is probably the same reason as to why they charge you for cucumber salad...so you have to wait to order, wait to receive it and PAY for it. Personally not worth giving them a second chance, in this tight economy, people like this do not deserve my hard earned dollars.  We ended up somewhere on Twain and Decateur at SHOBU and they were amazing!!!",

    "text": "Good sushi place to go to especially for the price. 21.95 for lunch and 26.95 for dinner all you can eat. They have a variety of dishes to choose from rice dishes to noodles to sashimi to specialty sushi rolls. My favorite rolls would have to be sexy, sex on the beach, and sex bomb. Also, he good thing is you can try the many varieties of sushi rolls because you have the option of getting half the amount of rolls. The service is great. You don't have just one server so you get attended to quickly. The atmosphere is great too. Music isn't too loud and if you love watching sports, they always have a game on the tv. This sushi restaurant is a go-to spot for me!",

    "text": "$25 for AYCE, I'll take it.  It most certainly gets busy for AYCE during lunch time. I came in with my family after a night of blurry fun. There was a total of 7 of us, but no tables were availble for another 20 mins. We asked if we could sit at the room that looked like a waiting area. It was their private dining room. To accommodate us, they agreed and sat us right away. They did inform us that the raw items may be a bit slow to get to our table due to the high volume of orders. We were okay with that.  They were great in accomodating our group. Service was pretty standard. But great that they were attentive towards use since we were in the private room. I appreciate that. The food actually came out quicker than we thought. Food was delicious and I was stuffed. I'd definitely come back for more in the future. It'll bit me my go to sushi joint in the future if I move there.  I love Sushi!",

    "text": "My big qualm with this place isn't necessarily the food, which is alright, but because of the deceiving pricing. If you go to this restaurant, make sure that you understand that the price listed is for each sushi and not for \"two pieces\" as described by the header. Two pieces of sushi ran me $8, plus an extra dollar for the apparent crime of using a card. That on top of the forty-minute wait time on Saturday was extremely bothersome. I think I could get better sushi quicker elsewhere, and unless you're looking to provide some mouth-driven sushi devastation via the All-You-Can-Eat price, I would stay away.  Honestly, if it weren't for the price confusion I would have given this place a 3.",

For those of you who've never experienced an all you can eat FRESH to order sushi then you have not lived!! They provide some of the best tasting options on an extensive menu that provides you a HUGE selection of dishes to choose from! In fact if you plan on coming on a regular they have a cool punch card they can provide you with so that everytime you eat, you are working toward a free meal the next time you dine with them! They are located on a pretty busy intersection of Spring Mountain and Arville and the parking can sometimes be a pain but other than that they have to make it on you sushi places to eat list for sure!!",

    "text": "This is my to go to spot for sushi in Las Vegas. I've been going here since New Years of 2011. The price hasn't changed Mich for their AYCE and they're open late, which is nice. I also like how they have a time limit, considering how they can get busy fast and some people like to gorge themselves on food.  I always get their seaweed salad here and their salmon skin hand roll. Even if I order a la carte, these will be my prime items. They DO offer half rolls, which is amazing since some rolls are like 8-10 pieces long! Food comes out promptly and they do mention that some items will take longer on the menu. I usually get nigiri here and I have been always satisfied. They also have a large variety of rolls to choose from if you're into all that.   Their service is borderline okay to good. They're prompt and they bus plates fairly quickly if you make them available, but they don't really have much personality or a smiling factor. But, considering the type of people who go into these type of restauarants, I shouldn't be surprised they end up not putting too much emphasis on that. So, be sure to tip!  Anyway, point being, I come back for the food and prompt service. Thanks guys!",

    "text": "My eyes definitely get me into trouble a lot of times!  And they certainly did here at Sushi Kaya.  On my Halloween weekend trip my best friend took us out to Chinatown to get a little away from the strip.  She has raved about Sushi Kaya for a long time now & finally convinced me to check it out.    We just missed the lunch price cut off, arriving at 4:04.  I like how you can order how ever much you want up front and even if you're not finished yet with your order you can still order more later.  The $25 all you can eat menu covers a lot of sushi, special rolls, izakayas, some teriyakis, noodle & rice dishes & well as dessert.  We all ordered what we wanted but shared especially if there was something that more than one of us wanted.  Good strategy right?    I know that this place is Korean ran and it's supposed to be a Japanese restaurant, but damnnn, the kimchi fried rice was so good and pretty spicy!  Finally a kimchi fried rice that deliverers on the heat for me!  I also enjoyed the beef tongue skewer which was grilled perfectly.  The sushi was pretty good too!  I think my favorite roll was the 911 roll which had spicy crab, crunch & cucumber.  My bestie also enjoyed my seafood yaki-udon, just wished they had a non-seafood option for the noodles!    Not a bad place and for all you can eat with such an extensive menu for $25, it's not a bad option that's not very far from the strip!",

They have cameras everywhere so that they can watch you eat and make sure you don't share with someone who went for the all you can eat. And they threaten to charge for any leftovers.

We were not happy and we felt that they were trying to rip us off with their all you can eat in their own way !!  I guess it's another way to rip off people. The Quality of the food was very horrible and we were all sick after we left the restaurant. There is more to say! I recommend you would never try this place!!! It's not because we didn't like it or we were not happy. If you don't believe it then try it for yourself! We will never go back to this place.

Now I understand that some of the guys I was with were in shorts and t-shirts because we had just come from a game but I have never felt more judged in my 23 years of life. I feel like they took one look at the guys because of the way they looked and didn't want to help them.  We probably went through five different servers, and I understand that these guys can be jokers but you should never judge a group of people by the way they're dressed. They wear suits and ties everyday make 6 figure salaries and because of they way were dressed we had some of the worst customer service. I'm still in shock.  The manager came around to every table while we were there, except ours. Our servers were very rude, our food took forever to get to us and the manager completely snubbed our group. We didn't even get a chance to let him know what was going on.  The food may have been decent but we would much rather go somewhere who treated us with respect no matter what were wearing then bring our business back here.",

To be honest I'm surprised we didn't end up leaving after that smell because I'm super picky. Anyways all the sushi was average the quality of the fish didn't seem that fresh. (P.s. I found my love for sushi in Reno (sushi Minato and ijji, for all my northern Nevada yelpers) therefore my expectations are set  high. I just haven't found a sushi place in Vegas that does it like Reno. :(  the only good thing about this place was the smoked salmon and the fast service.

    "text": "This place is a good spot to go to if u wanna do AYCE. Their prices are pretty worth it and the menu is big and have a lot of yummy sushi rolls which i loveeee! The nigiri's are pretty small which i dont mind at all cause im really tiny and i get full really fast lol and i dont like to eat too much white rice anyway.  The service is pretty fast and u can order half a roll if u cant finish a full one which is a plus for me! The only down side is they get quite busy around dinner time and there's usually a wait but once they sit you they get your order right away. Will definitely come back here again for some AYCE!!!",

    "text": "One of my worst experiences. I have been coming to the establishment for years. The food is always good and the service is always awesome. During this particular occurrence it was less than par. I understand having a bigger party makes it harder to seat. so i understood when they said it was going to be a 20 mins wait. but when 20 mins goes by and then another 20 mins goes by and they say nothing it gets a little frustrating. especially when they start seating other parties that came after you. I get when a group of 2 or 3 are seated before my party because they have smaller seating available but when there are groups of 5 and 6 sat before me and when we asked the hostess about why they were being seated before you I get they have a smaller party. when looking at the seats that the groups received my family could have more than fit comfortably. and for a restaurant that doesn't take reservations and being told that there are two tables being reserved for a party of 2? I don't understand. when I was passed on to the manager all they could say was sorry. The didn't help make it any better of a visit. not asking for all our meals to be compt or anything but maybe hey lets us take care of your drinks or something. got nothing showing that they wanted to take care of our service or anything. what is going on wih this place.",

    "text": "12/28  Okay, I went for the AYCE during dinner and it was under $25.  I ordered ice water so I'm not sure if the price includes your beverage.  Good selection of Sushi / Appetizers.  PROS: * cheaper than most AYCE sushi dinner * lots of unique appetizers on the menu that I have never seen at any other AYCE sushi joints (Spicy Udon, specialty skewers, Bulgogi, & more) * clean w/ awesome decor * Nigiri was fresh * comfortable seating (sushi bar available too) * open late * Low Sodium Soy Sauce  CONS: * slow service & forgot to input some of our orders * Limited to only 1 of each type of skewer available * parking sucks !!  * drink refills are non-existent.  I waited like 15 minutes to get more H20!  TIPS: * If they don't tell you, make sure to ask for a Stamp Card... So worth it! * you can host a mini-party-  Karaoke Room available to rent out that can host up to 20 people.  Sushi and karaoke ...awesome !!  Not overpriced either ! * Ask for two drinks, that way you do not have to wait for a refill. * This place gets pretty crowded so make sure to order enough sushi (assuming you are doing the AYCE) to keep you busy. * if you buy 2 rolls of sushi, you may as well take advantage of the AYCE deal... I'm just saying.  -=)  Highly Recommended  Start serving Sashimi on your AYCE and you'll get a 5 star hah.",

Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that service can get really slow from ordering to delivery simply because there are so many people serving each table that things get lost in translation.  other than that I really do love it. Great food, great price for AYCE sushi.",

Kitchen food takes forever, but guess that's better than it being cooked in bulk and then left out.  Shrimp tempura was undercooked, batter was half done. Sushi chefs were rude!! You know when they are cracking up then staring at the tables as the sushi is being served. The good stuff has a 1 per person limit. That sucks ! The steak skewers ( well, 1 skewer max) are GREAT!! Cheesecake is usually frozen when it arrives to your table. Mochi is great, Overall in vegas sushi kaya is pretty good. Occasional negative thing here and there. But it came down to only 4 rolls that I would go back for. Maybe if I was a sashimi fan, it'd be different. Just my opinion",

The rolls were good, although, when my daughter's california roll was served, i couldn't believe how much rice they used on her roll , she had  a hard time eating it.   This place also makes it clear that you do not waste food, even rice on your roll, so make sure that you eat what you order! (not that they said anything to me since i ate everything).  Everything was good except for one roll I ate that tasted kinda fishy. and Fish shouldn't taste fishy, so the quality of fish is questionable.   I was there for 2 hours with my daughter and so I don't think they have a time limit?  I would go back because I love their mussels and their Jose roll. =)",

    "text": "I wasn't impressed on my first visit and I think it was mainly because I came with a big party (orders weren't met and given to the wrong people, etc). But the second and third time I've been here was pretty good. The second time I was here with two of my girlfriends celebrating Christmas a couple days earlier and the recent one was with my bff during lunch. Dinner seems to always have a wait, especially during peak hours (starting at 7pm til around 10pm). Even during lunch there's still some wait time (damn this place is popular). For $19.95 lunch and $24.95 dinner AYCE, their prices are on the lower side which might be the reason why they're always packed. I really liked their baked green mussels, nigiri, and dessert. Their rolls are a hit or miss for me, so are their other appetizers and skewers. I try at least three different rolls every visit, then maybe one day I'll figure out which ones are my favorite. EDIT: so far I've liked their \"viagra\" roll haha! I love getting their almond mocha ice cream and green tea mochi ice cream for dessert. I finally warmed up to Kaya, so I'll add this place to my \"Sushi List.\"   Btw, I noticed some of their hosts graduated from my high school. I found this amusing haha",

Aside from sushi, they have a variety of other choices on their menu. This is unlike other all you can eat sushi joints who gives you only 10-15 sushi options.  I have no complaints with their food and their price but I do have a problem with their service, hence, the 4 stars. Every time we go there, we never know who our server is. It seems to me the servers are very inexperienced. They get your first order and you never see them again. You're constantly trying to look for someone to get your order. It's kinda like whoever passes by gets your order. Sometimes I feel like they're doing this on purpose so that you can't order as much as you want too since there's a 90 minute limit.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. They just need a lot of improvement on the customer service part.",

So the waiter stands there and expects you to order everything up front before the kitchen closes.   The rice that came with each order was hard.  The waiter never came by to see if I need anything, he just drop off the orders and left.  He never refilled my drink or asked me how was everything.  The only time I saw him again was when I had to flag him down for the check.   This used to be a great place.   I was surprised how slow it was for a Saturday night, even at that hour they used to be packed.  Now I can understand perfectly why.",
