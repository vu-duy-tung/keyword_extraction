    "text": "I would love to give this place fewer stars, but I can't... because of an amazing bartender named Emanuel.   We started outside and the outdoor bar, but it started to rain, so we went inside. At the indoor bar, we were ignored for a good 30 minutes. All the while, we were attempting to capture the bartender's attention like we were drowning and she had the life preserver. Nothing. She was literally 2 feet from us and would turn her back to us to serve brand new walk-ups.   After 30 minutes of neglect, we went back to the outdoor bar, despite the rain. I have a feeling it was because we had all-you-can-drink wristbands, but it doesn't matter. As we were walking out, the manager said, \"Thank you, ladies!\" (Thinking we were leaving.) I stopped and said, \"We're not leaving. We just can't get served in there, so we're going outside.\"   Here's what had me most taken aback - she ROLLED her eyes at me and walked away! No, \"I apologize. What can I get for you?...\" or anything of the sort. Must be nice to be in a position where you can afford to be blatantly rude to customers!  The experience outside was completely different. The bartenders were far busier outside, but they were conscious, attentive and friendly. The only reason I'm giving a decent rating to this place is because of our experience outside, especially with Emanuel.   Bottom line is we drank 35 drinks between us and tipped more than average per drink, then left an extra larger bill for him at the end.   I'm not even going to blame the indoor bartender because she's obviously being managed by someone with a horrible attitude and zero clue about customer service.  Thank you, Emanuel, for turning our experience around so quickly and for making my birthday VERY special!!!",

    "text": "We had lunch on Saturday, they were celebrating Horny Halloween, but the crowd was gathered for college football. It took us a few minutes to be seated. We looked over the menu and got started with their pepper poppers. They looked unappealing, and they were very greasy. The pepper was very tough, when you tried to cut into it, the filling spilled out.  Next, came our entrees the Big Bossman salad and the Bloomin' Onion burger. The burger is topped with cheese and fried, and then served with grilled onions, tomato and bacon. It was dry, dry, dry. How can that be? After the peppers the grease was too much to bear so I switched with my hubby a few bites in. The salad was wilted. It seemed like a bowl of mush. I was not a fan. The husband asked for their house cornbread muffins. The texture was off, but the flavor was decent, I liked addition of diced jalapeno. They were the highlight of the meal.  Service was average, and overall the place had an odd vibe. It's a great place to watch games, lots of nice TVs, but stick to drinks because the food is weak. PBR makes you think country, but much of the music was rock. I suppose it is a rock bar, but then they threw in pop like Katy Perry. Not sure how that fits. I'd say it has a bit of an identity crisis.",

The giant burger my husband had was literally falling apart it was so rare. :( We didn't complain though, he was hungry so he ate the outer edges and the fries. I  had the pulled pork and it was fantastic. The portions were huge. The price was way higher than it should be of course, but comparable to any sports bar/grill restaurant on the strip.

My rights to be at a public establishment were violated because a guy who is a regular at the bar or at least he tips the bartender \"Cara\" well said we were rude.  My buddy and I were \"cut off\" first of all my buddy was only drinking soda.   The \"regular\" and the bartender Cara already had thier shot together so he wanted to talk to someone else. He was trying to tell me his life story at the bar.  I was not interested.  Even the bartender Cara told him a few times not to be nosy because he even asked my buddy who happens to work for the same company how much he makes.  He kept talking to me even though he knew because I told him he talked a lot that I had no interest in speaking to him.  So after I  finished my cocktail the restaurant manager Jeffery told us we had to leave. We were not asked any questions by Jeffery but told we were cut off (btw my buddy had not has a alcoholic drink at all). I asked why and Jeffery said because he had a complaint.  If the bartender Cara's only concern is tips then you should not be allowed to over serve a regular then take shots with them. I asked for the General managers card and the Gil and Jeffery would not give it to me it was not until I had to reenter to have one of the other personnel give me Matt Aldrich's card. I have called Matt the GM hopefully I will get a response.  I certainly hope the video and audio is reviewed and I am contacted with the apology.",

The first place we were seated we had to move because there was a table of 4 women and 3 of them were smoking. I thought smoking was against the law at restaurants in Las Vegas? Either way it was gross. We ordered 2 teas, bucking bull potatoes, a Caesar salad, and steak &eggs. The food was just ok. I I wish we had eaten somewhere else honestly. The potatoes were smothered in cheese sauce(sounds great right?) and the bacon was more like bacon bits vs nice crispy bacon. My salad was just blah. All the dressing was at the bottom, the pieces of lettuce were huge and not too fresh looking. The corn bread croutons were not crunchy.  I feel like we wasted $50. We should have eaten at Mon Ami Gabi.",

We decided to hit the walk up bar rather than going inside (the music was SO loud and the  inside was packed), the girl at the bar totally ignored us even though we stood in front of her for atleast 3 minutes before she looked up. We handed over the coupon, she looked at it dumbfounded, and then said \"Ok, you can only get this cup!\" as she showed us the Pilsner cups, we knew this already since it clearly stated it on the voucher. So we told her what flavor frozen drink we wanted, I got the Hurricane and my wife got Coral Crush, mine was down right sour, pretty much undrinkable, and the coral crush was way too sweet. Pretty glad we didn't pay full price for the drinks or the horrible service.",

They didn't play any of the games over the speaker just showed them on the TVs which I would have preferred to at least hear the main game.    The bull was used quite a few times which was pretty entertaining.

Maybe over cooked? Not sure just not good and I still want fries.. Added a garden salad had some kind of dressing already mixed in, it was tasty and a good size.  The benches you sit on were not comfortable. Be prepared. Unless you have a lot of cushion maybe. ?? Staff was friendly mostly. Pricey, everything was good except the fries.",

Something you'd find anywhere.   Casual eatery, lots of blue collar, happy hour folks and baby boomers just wanting to have a good time. I'd say give it a try :)",

That was really good. Good service inside the restaurant...   But the hostesses, oh my god, a total disaster, that is the young ladies that greet you at the entrances lacked intelligence, were rude, slow, unaware, condescending, argumentative, inefficient, unprofessional and hostile.  I came to the restaurant at 7:30 on July 9th. I was given one price for entry by the outside hostess but at the main entrance I was greeted with outright hostility and condescension by another two hostesses and was told the price was higher and was accused of lying.  Another hostess accused me of inappropriately touching her when my shirt cuff accidentally brushed against her. Finally once inside another hostess wanted to make sure we knew the people we were sitting with and stopped to make sure we weren't lying about knowing our table mates.  I am happy to provide a more detailed account to any member of the management team should they want to contact me.   In conclusion, a decent spot to watch a fight with food and drinks that are not disappointing. But the staff that manages the entrances should not be working in the service industry and are hurting this business with their lack of aptitude, intelligence and basic host skills.",

So, lunch it was, at PBR.  And we were kind of drunk already.  Beers weren't too badly priced, we got wings which were REALLY good, very spicy.  Also got the pulled pork sandwich, but since I was planning to hit the pool later, I ditched the bun...don't want to look fat and carb'y.  Where do I get the idea that not eating bread will be a good idea, in Vegas?  Ugh.  Anyway, it's not the sandwiches fault!  Was also good, and came with Sweet Potato Tater Tots, of which I had one...was very tasty!  BF had the rest and concurred. Damn, I should have had more than one!!!  We'd go there again, it was fun to sit on the patio, lots of people watching, shaded tables, food that we had was very good, beers were not a complete \"F U we can charge ridiculous prices...it's Vegas\".",

In a vacuum, it's mediocre at best but considering the price (my sandwich was $15 and that's probably on the cheaper end here) and what else you can be eating (it's in LV with so many other competitors) I have to make it 2 stars. The mac and cheese honestly tasted like easy mac and the cheese on the nachos gave me Taco Bell flashbacks.  The decor was so tacky and stereotypical and they blasted two sources of music way too loud so you can't talk about how bad your food is to your friends/family.  Tldr: pretty bad. I'd give it another try if it weren't so expensive. Fast food tastes better and is a better value.",

I had the brisket sandwich which was quite terrible but would've gotten 3 stars if it weren't for Heather who tipped herself 20% even though her service was a 15% at best. The bottom of the receipt already has the calculated tips and she wrote in pen a total that gave her the 20% suggestion and circled the \"total\" which also incidentally nearly blacked out the actual printed total pre-tip. We gave her our two cards and told her $69 on one and $23 on the other. Not only was she incompetent and switched the cards (they're not even the same colors) but she charged extra to the one that was supposed to be $23 so that she bumped herself up from a 17% back to 20%.   It wasn't that much of a difference at all, but it's the principle. Especially because she had me reiterate how much each card was supposed to charged. Besides the fact that she forced us to give her a 20%, she was rude to us from the start when taking our orders practically spewing venom. She was clearly having a bad day but geez if you're going to give yourself 20% you can at least be fake nice / pleasant or at a bare minimum indifferent.",

We were in a party of about 8 so gratuity was already going to be included. Well, they must of took the fact that they were already getting a good tip to give us horrible service. First of, our waiter took forever to get to us. We ordered food and drinks our waters and regular drinks took about 13 minutes to come out the beers took about 20 mins to come out. Our food  took about 45 minutes.  Our group had two orders of wings once they came out with food the wings were dead cold.  We had no water refills for the longest time. We told our waiter about the wings and he took them back. Then another server lady came by and asked us how everything was we told her we didn't have any silverware nor napkins she came by brought us the silverware she also told us she spoke to the manager and the wings would be comped.    Well, I had to ask for water with the girl since we had not seen our original waiter since our food came out. We received our bill and the wings were still included on the bill. When we asked our second waiteress she said \"she thought they were gonna be comped but they are not\". Well, we are not paying and we didn't wr told her and she said she would talk to the manager. She came back and told us they were taken off the bill and they were.   So was two good burgers entrees worth $50 dollars, Nope!",

    "text": "In the day, PBR Rock Bar & Grill is a restaurant in Planet Hollywood. At night it turns into a club. At the restaurant I showed up around 2pm on a Sunday looking for some breakfast after having a late night at their club. I was glad to see breakfast was served all day. There was no wait to be seated which was great as every other place our group of 4 seemed to look into was packed. I ordered the Country Scramble which was basically scrambled eggs with mushrooms, tomato's and ham with gravy on top. It came with toast and tater tots which I love. I also tried the Breakfast Skins which are pretty standard potato skins but add egg. Those were good as well. I probably sound like all I do is eat, but I also tried the Grilled Cheese B.E.T. which is an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich and also liked that. Definitely no complaints with the food. It came probably 10 minutes after we ordered. The atmosphere is also great as there are TV's everywhere with different sports on. Great for someone like me who can't get enough of sports. The bathrooms are labeled \"The Can\" and have an attendant working in them at all times. It's nice to tip I suppose, but call me crazy... I'm not into tipping guys that drop soap on my hands and hand me a towel. The guy was just as nice to me even when he realized he wasn't getting a tip. The only kind of annoying thing was our server asked if we were ok probably 25 times during our meal... which I find a little excessive. I'd rather have them come around too much than not at all though. Oh ya... this place has a mechanical bull in the restaurant which provides a little entertainment if anyone feels the need to show off their 8 second ride during the day.  The night before, I visited the club at PBR Rock Bar & Grill because my group just had to play some beer pong. There is typically a cover, but we got in for free since it was my girlfriends birthday and we each got buy one get one free vouchers for drinks. Nice to see they cater to birthdays. They had a DJ mixing and a dance floor with a cage you could climb in for you ladies who wanna get freaky. We got some drinks and headed over to the beer pong tables to battle it out. They had 3 tables which all weren't in use, but shortly after we started playing, 2 other groups started using the other tables. It was a nice mix to the bar scene. The thing I found interesting was this place didn't play any country music, and this is the same place which had the mechanical bull. However the bull is outside of the bar section so it seems to only be a day time event. Overall this is a great place if you want something a little more low-key than a club and is open till 3am for you that go to bed when the sun rises.",

Enough shrimp, certainly, but the sandwich was hard to eat and there was almost no sauce, so the sandwich was really bready and dry.

I didn't get a chance to eat here because they ran out of the normal, lower dining tables and only had seating at the bar or one of those high top / bar tables. This is NOT good for a person in a wheelchair like myself. I was informed by a hostess that a month ago management decided to remove 1/2 of the dining tables and replace them with the high tops... thus becoming way less wheelchair friendly. I don't want to eat when I can't see my food because the plate would be at eye level or worse depending on the height of one's wheelchair. This is just WRONG.   For just drinking purposes, I suppose it would do.  But , I definitely think they need to do something about this little bit of discrimination and use a little common sense. How can I eat from a high top table when I can barely see what I would be eating? I'd get more ON me than IN me.  I was really looking forward to eating at this place too.

Our waiter (forgot his name) was pretty cool and offered great customer service. We ordered a porch pounder (the 100 oz drink and the main reason we decided to dine there). I don't know if it was because we ordered the Peach Punch but we were not able to taste any hint of alcohol. Our waiter was kind enough to send our bowl of juice back to the bar. Although the bartender added more alcohol we left perfectly sober.   The food was ok. I ordered the PBR Burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was a decent size and would have been great if not for the dry bun it was served on. My friends enjoyed their meal.   My friends informed our waiter of my birthday and he came back with a free birthday shot. Of course anything free tastes great... so no complaints here. Our waiter was even kind enough to give all three of us a free bull ride (which was the highlight of our time there).   I believe in second chances and would go back one more time to allow this place a chance to redeem itself.",

Our group ordered the Mac and Cheese balls which turned out to be lukewarm. The ribs we ordered was VERY tough almost like a dog toy and the sweet potato fries had an unusual taste.   The decor is above average. Loved the heated areas on the patio and the fires on table. Overall ok experience for a late night drunken stop. Food wise I'll have to pass and stick with McDonalds.",

For that purpose, it definitely fit the bill -- a ton of televisions all over the restaurant, including one right at our table. An even better viewing environment than a sportsbook.  Service was very slow, though of course it was a pretty packed night. That said, the steak and eggs I ordered was very good -- particularly for ~$10, a steal of a price. I actually don't order steak and eggs that often, but I was glad I did here. The side breakfast potatoes were tasty, though there weren't enough onions mixed in (what ones were on the plate were delicious, which made their relative scarcity all the more tragic).  All in all, I was pleased with the experience. I'd definitely go back in a similar circumstance (a place where I could have a nice casual dinner without missing a big sporting event).",

The menu was very outdated and most of the beers they had on there they didn't have anymore, but the food was all still the same. I asked for my salad dressings on the side (most places put too much on) and they forgot on the house salad, lucky they got the balance right. And my steak was cooked perfectly.

The tables are huge and high, an uncomfortable combo for a shortie, but that's not what this is about. I ordered the meat pizza, a friend ordered the bacon mac and cheese and we talked our co-worker into trying the \"largest burger,\" on the menu. It boasted to have lots of meat, a fried egg, bacon, cheese and hollandaise sauce. We started off the meal with fried pickles, which had a great crunch and a spicy kick at the end. They were delish. My pizza was not that exciting, or flavorful. It was sufficient, but I like when the cheese is carmelized a little, and this one fell a little short in flavor. The bacon mac and cheese was recommended by our friendly server, and proved to be the best thing that we ordered. The Big burger was reported to having a lack of flavor. He finished most of the burger, but said it didn't impress in flavor. All in all, the service was friendly, the food was sufficient, but not exciting or distinct enough for me to want to go back.",

App came with the burgers.  Unfortunately silverware and napkins didn't come with the meal. Asked the guy who delivered the food & he said he'd be right back. Never saw him again. Asked our server and he said he'd be right back. Meanwhile food is getting cold. Asked another server and she said sure. She did come back, with 4x4 cocktail napkins and silverware. Good thing the garlic mashed potatoes were in a crock like container and weren't ice cold. They probably would have been good warm. The app was average and the burger worse.  If I had only walked about another 100 yds I could have had a bacon smokehouse burger from McDonald's which are very good. And for about 1/3 of the cost. Maybe it was a bad day for the server, but for everyone at the place to be having a bad day at the same time? Sad",

The nachos consist of cheese (real cheese), sour cream, beans, guacamole and jalepenos layered over a bed of mesquite potato chips. The potato skins were great too! PBR has multiple bars inside and lots of screens for catching all the latest sports action.   I wasn't even too hungry when we sat down and the food still tasted great.

For breakfast my boyfriend ordered the Mexican Omelette and I had the Western Omelette. Add hash browns for $1.99 extra. He ordered them, I passed but added avocado also $1.99 more. After breakfast was ordered a photographer approached our table and asked if we were interested in having our picture taken. After she took two pictures she informed us that she would return in a few minutes with the photos. We were not obligated to purchase them but chose to since it was his 50th birthday, and the pictures turned out really nice. Our breakfast was really good and the omelettes were pretty large so I am really happy that I passed on the hash browns. All in all a pretty good experience. Only complaint... $4.00 for a soda is a little pricey :(",

Service was prompt they were not trying to hard to please, but still attentive. I ordered a Sam Adams to drink, they were out of Sam and I settled with a Stella Artois... however I'm pretty sure they gave me Bud Light. My friend had a drink with \"Carribean\" in the name, I can't remember what it was, but reminded me of a Virgin Islands \"Pain Killer\" (Pussers British Rum and a little juice) it was delicious and a generous pour.   We ordered burgers for lunch, my friend had the \"American\" and I had the \"BBQ Burger\". They were both very good and the only complaint I had is both of our buns fell apart while eating them, so some old bread, but they were still good. The fries were great and the ranch dressing delicious (it really is hard to find good ranch).   The bill for 2 at lunch was $41.00, for the strip not bad. I have given up on the fact that Vegas has any hand made burger patties on the strip, since they are more geared for a volume based restaurant these were right out of a box.   With all the food choices, this place is good for the patio and not much more.... unless I have out of town guests who have their hearts set on the novelty of the PBR, I won't be back.",

By the time we sat down, ordered and got our food I could have gone through the line at Earl of Sandwich about 6 times.  Our lunch took over 2 hours.  We had to wait a little while for the table but most of the time was spent waiting for our food which was NOT worth it.  Some of our meals were cold, and all were just not good.  Service was terrible.  When she did come by she was not at all polite.  I'm sure the fact that we were all hungover and just wanted some food did not help.  Head over to Earl of Sandwich instead for a much better and much faster meal.",

The food is absolutely stellar and it's reasonably priced. My absolute favorite meal here, and I'm not usually a big meat person, is the brisket grinder. It's brisket, with onion rings, roasted red pepper and aged white cheddar on a grinder. It is so awesome. And you can get tator tots. The people we've taken with us have all loved their food as well. My fiance had a burger that had pulled pork and cole slaw on it and he can't wait to have it again.",

Yeah, that was a deciding factor for me lol. My fiance got an adios mother fuc*er and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. My fiances drink was strong and well work the money while my sister and I's drinks were just overpriced slushies. Pretty disappointing since it was my sister's first drink ever and because I can get buzzed off of an 8oz. glass of wine. My fiance even asked the waitress if there was any alcohol or if it was a virgin. According to her, it had 10%, same as a beer. I get buzzed off of a beer so they must have forgotten to put the alcohol in. Pretty disappointing. We won't be returning unfortunately.",

    "text": "My review is for their nightly bar/club.  Back in October 2012, I visited the outside bar for their Friday happy hour from 3-6pm and I really enjoyed it.  This past weekend I was able to experienced their bar/club area on a Thursday Night and Saturday night. Both nights it was with a group of people.   We arrived to Vegas on Thursday around 8pm and started walking the strip around 10pm in search of a bar with cheap drinks and some good music. We were approached by a promoter for the bar and go us in for free. Music was great it was a mix of Hip-Hop & Top-40. Drinks were decently priced ($7 for well).   Saturday Night we didn't want to do the whole club scene at a premier club so we end up contacting the same promoter who end up giving us his info on Thursday night. He got us in for only $25 which included open bar all night. Again the music was pretty much the same as Thursday.   Overall, it was a great bar/club. If you are simply looking to grab cheap drinks, dance and have fun without all the premier glam, this is the spot. No waiting to get a drink, no bumping into people and ladies no long lines to use the restroom.",

I had a good time BS'ing with one of the bouncers and the bartender was attentive Halloween night.   We returned the following night/morning for some post-party eats, and visited the restaurant side instead (This is where it turns to Three stars and I'm being gracious). We were sat in a large booth. Soon after sitting I felt my dress sticking to the seat (sequin mini dress BTW), gross right?! I had my friend check the back of my dress, and some class-act before us left chewed up gum in the damn booth.  It was stuck to my dress, back of thighs, and the damn seat! We notified the waitress of the issue and she then notified another guy in the bar. He mentioned he couldn't make any official decisions (why are you even there then..) and had to let the next manager know. I told him we were flying back to CA at 11am and we wouldn't be able to return. He asked for my cell number and told me the day-manager would call me about my dress in the next day or two. Well, no call from anyone there about my dress. Way to go guy! Will I return here if/when I return to Vegas on future trips?? Ummm, ehhh.. I'm not sure, I highly doubt it though. (BTW, WD-40 gets gum off of clothing. I'd be way more upset if my dress was ruined forever from piss-poor bussing & cleaning of tables and chairs in this place.)",

It was good but very dry. Although I do not drink myself, my friend was very upset that she couldn't get a PBR because they don't carry it. And the waitress said most people want one considering it's the name of the ace, but they don't serve them.   The waitress was super sweet and when one of our burgers wasn't cooked enough she quickly took it back. The place is average, but the decor is nice, the service is good and after a long and tiring day, their food hits the spot.",

We intended to get lunch, a couple beers, and then head back to our hotel to rest up for the evening. Four hours later we left.  We sat outside at the bar on the patio. I thought it was perfect. It was noon on a weekday and not very crowded. The bartenders were friendly and the service was fine.  I had a turkey sandwich. I wish I could remember more. I remember that the cole slaw was a bit spicy. My guess is the turkey sandwich was average. We didn't want to eat a ton because we were going to go to a buffet for dinner. I have no recollection of what my husband had, unfortunately.  If you make any sort of purchase, you get to ride the bull for free. I'm hoping my husband accidentally deleted the video of me attempting to do that.  For what it was - weekday afternoon, moderate crowd, lunch, beer & conversation with some fun people who were sitting by us, it was just fine. I can't say what it's like at night or when it's much more busy. Sitting on the patio was fun. I would definitely consider going back for drinks again.",

We saw they had super cheap breakfast options so we decided to return before catching our flight home. After waiting 15-20 minutes for a simple breakfast order of a burrito and scrambled eggs, bacon and toast, and another couple being served even though they ordered after is, we eventually were able to flag down our waitress. She went to check on our food and returned 5 minutes later to tell us she had forgotten to put in our order. By this time, we didn't have enough time to wait, so we left hungry.",

After being rude to us while ordering drinks we didn't see her for 45 mins.. she never walked by to ask what we wanted to eat, we saw 2 other tables sit down after us and get their food before us. After complaining to get a new sever, the managers came up to apologize and let us know they would comp us for our troubles. Thomas came up to take over (we decided to grab our check early and go somewhere else) but he was SO FREAKIN SWEET and got me a free drink and just had the sweetest words to say. We saw him running around taking care of all his tables WHILE STILL TAKING CARE OF US with a beautiful smile on his face!! Every one else was so so so sweet but if you get Savanna- ASK FOR THOMAS INSTEAD!!!",

My waitress was extremely slow and would rush us when asked questions about the menu. Once we received our food we never saw her again and had to go looking for her to get out check. I got the club sandwich and it was very poorly put together. There was hardly any of the mayo sauce and it was just in the middle of the bread and the rest of the. Read was dry. They chose large presentation over making a quality sandwich. It was below average. The views are awesome as the location is right in the center of the Las Vegas strip. If your not gonna sit outside and enjoy the views then there is no point in eating here in my opinion. There are plenty of other places that are too close with better food and service.",

    "text": "My boyfriend was craving a breakfast sandwich and I suggested checking out the Earl of Sandwich. Since we had already spent quite a bit on lunch the previous day, we were looking for a more affordable option. When we discovered that the Earl quit serving breakfast at noon (and it was 1 PM), we ended up across the way at PBR Rock Bar. Stumbling upon this ended up being a pretty good Vegas find.   I figured that I had already eaten enough junk for a week in my first day at Vegas so I decided to be good and order a salad. As soon as I noticed that PBR offered half salad orders, I was completely sold. Thank you for offering an option for lighter eaters! I can never finish a full restaurant salad and not only do they not typically hold well as leftovers but many Vegas hotels don't offer refrigerators to store leftovers either. Finally, I can confidently order a salad and know that I won't be wasting half of it. Also, by ordering a half salad, my Country Fried Salad decreased from a ridiculous $17 to a much less intimidating $10. The salad is topped with chicken tenders, tomatoes and cheese and I asked for the cucumbers and bacon to be removed. I also asked for a side of ranch instead of having the salad tossed in honey mustard. I'm not a fan of pre-tossed salads as they tend to get soggy. Although I thought the ranch was quite good at first, it lost some of its appeal throughout the meal so I know it wasn't quite the normal restaurant quality ranch that I love. Even at a half size, I could still barely finish it and I can't imagine what a full-sized salad would look like.   The Tex-Mex Scramble ended up catching my boyfriend's eye and he chose that over the intended breakfast sandwich. The eggs with pepper jack cheese were served with tater tots and toast and it seemed to hit the spot for him as a great hangover food option.   I noticed when I checked in that they were offering a Yelp special of buy one, get one drinks. Since my boyfriend claims that beer helps him get over a hangover, he was more than happy to partake in this deal.   Our waiter was a little odd and very chatty but I think he meant well. He seemed like the type to get nervous, such as when our food was taking awhile to come out, and then talk to much to overcompensate.   We also had a photographer stop by our table to take pictures and then, of course, try to sell them to us. At first, she offered them for $20 for two framed photos. When we said no, she then offered just the photos for $10. Normally, I'd still say no but the photos were quite good and it was a vacation so I ended up taking her up on the deal and finding my own Vegas frame in the Miracle Mile Shops.  Overall, I was very pleased to find a spot on the Strip with at least some more affordable food options and I'd definitely considering returning on a future trip.",

For a whole pitcher of PBR, cups, and 2 pong balls costs $23; kinda pricey but it's okay! We had a fun time playing beer pong that afternoon. Also other people playing beer pong near us were fun and also helped us whenever we dropped the pong ball. After 2 games, we were just so done and tired. So much alcohol was consumed that afternoon.  Overall, this is a cool spot for fun activities... bull riding, beer pong, food! I still need to try the food though.",

They have the best long islands not only on the strip but just just about anywhere. And we've had them everywhere. 3 nights, 3 different bartenders and all the same... the best! The food is great with great prices. Even came the next morning for breakfast. Plus they have the games on and inside there are phone charging ports. And live music outside on the patio. One of our favorite places on the strip!!!",

When the owners decide to sell terrible food, your customers will notice and hold you accountable.

From the moment that we walked through the door, the staff seemed so disinterested in being there..none of them even smiled. We had been at our seat for about 1 minute and was asked if we were ready to order food - seriously!!! Food wise - we ordered the Full Pork Ribs with fries and coleslaw. Ribs were over cooked and had no sauce on them and were dry, fries were cold and tasted like they had been in the kitchen for awhile, well the coleslaw was ok! Service was not the best we have had and they expected us to tip them $8 on top - was not happening I would not recommend this place to anyone",

We sat on the deck and ordered a couple mixed drinks.   We had a chop salad, brisket and asked for the dessert to-go. Salad was big, tasty and used fresh ingredients. No limp or brown lettuce, which is a plus to see for such a large chain-like restaurant. The dressing was good in my opinion.  Other reviews said too citrusy, but I like that. Peppercini rings was a nice touch. Brisket was done nicely,  bbq sauce was average and side mac n cheese was also average tasting, but hot and creamy. Again, good for such a big place. Overall,  a positive experience.",

They had a crisp outside but not to much and lots of sauce. They weren't spicy enough though could have been hotter. My husband had the burger and he really enjoyed it and the serving size was huge! I hat a couple Hat benders which is an alcoholic beverage and I liked it. It had a tart sweet kick to it if that makes sense.

The bar has an outside area with heat lamps, tables and a full bar with TVs. Upon walking through the entrance of the mall, there is a stand with pretty ladies where you can buy drinks. The bar also has a main room and then a side room so in total, I count 4 bars. I've always been to this bar when it is not busy during the week so food service has always been relatively fast with friendly waitresses.  I'd imagine this place gets slammed during sports watching events.  I ordered the chicken fingers and they were relatively greasy but decent. They do in fact have decent happy hour prices during the afternoons. I ate here today with some friends and we split some potato skins and a taco pizza. The skins were cooked perfectly and the taco pizza had alot of taste. I ordered a steak salad which was not too bad either.  I give this place 3 stars for being a typical sports bar in Vegas that has the overpriced bar food that although has a nice bar atmosphere, they have alot of competition around the strip and do not exactly separate themselves from it.",

I can't remember the name, but it was a gamechanger. It was romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, but THEN it got sexy and ADDED pulled pork, bacon, bbq chicken, brisket... O M G. There are no words.

So good I remembered her name \"Bre\" great personality. Help us choosing what to order kept us entertained  talked to us next thing you know our food was out before we even knew it. Great quality food and all the staff were friendly. Bre was able to convince me to even ride the bull there which was deff a good choice and a new memory to add to my favorites of vegas. I come to vegas alot and never even knew about he bull. It's also one of the cheapest activities you can do in vegas so make sure you tip the staff. They deserve it unlike most places where they ignore you unless you spend and flirt. Good location. After I rode the bull a crowd came and alot people tried and I even did it a 2nd time.  thought i just sprained my hand found out i broke my wrist. That was my down fall.  What can you do its not like I was forced but still ill deff be back soon when I fly in to town again. Thanks again Bre",

The 100 oz fish bowl is a must!! You will definitely get your money's worth. We received a complimentary photo postcard and bull ride! When trying to ride the bull, we faced some problems with one worker, Alexis or Alexa. After waiting several minutes to ride, she did not acknowledge our presence choosing to serve others before us. We simply told her, we were here first. She stated how that was not her problem. Even going as far as trying to intimidate us because we asked to speak with a manager. This interaction definitely turned an amazing experience into a bad one.",

    "text": "We decided to eat here after taking a short walk from the NY NY.  Outside, we were offered 2 for 1 drink coupons so we came inside and were seated to a small empty bar on the left. Not being happy with the vibe and wanting something a little more lively we moved to the other side of the restaurant and took a seat at an inside picnic bench.   Our waiter quickly arrive and took our orders and advised that the drink coupons were only good on the other side of the bar. We ended up just sticking with water.   There were 6 of us ordering various things. I ordered the ribs and brisket combo with fries.  The ribs were okay but the brisket was disgusting , it was shaved and didn't taste like it was smoked. It seemed more like it was boiled and they just poured sauce on it without even letting it caramelize. So I didn't eat it, I also let someone else in my party try it to make sure it wasn't just me and they also found it uneatable.   The waiter was very good and attentive, so at some point he came by and asked how everything was, so I told him I didn't care for the brisket. He offered to bring something else to replace it, which  I appreciated  it but by that point I was just over it and said no thank you. I also said, I was more than happy to pay for the meal and wasn't expecting a discount or anything , I was just giving feed back because he asked.  Before the bill came, the waiter brought a manger over and he apologized; and asked what was wrong with it ( I didn't think he was challenging my opinion, I think he just wanted feed back on how they could have done it differently) .  I told him that I just thought it tasted gross- and fatty; and again I said I wasn't expecting anything as the service and the rest of the food was good.   When the bill came, they took my entire meal off the menu..which I didn't expect but I think it says a lot about them. They tried to make it right by offering something else..then giving me way more than I asked for (especially because I didn't really ask for anything)    So because all the other food was good, the service was fantastic and they tried to make the customer happy, I am giving them 4 stars. I would eat here again because the over all experience was good.",

We came here as a large group and it was perfect for sharing a bunch of appetizers and delicious cocktails! They have cocktail bowls here that are massive and will f@$k you up! The Caribbean sunset one was my favorite, Malibu coconut rum, Bacardi and orange & pineapple juice! A tropical paradise in a cup or bowl...

So let's try it again!   We were greeted and seated immediately.  Kevin, our waiter, was over in a flash to get our drink order.  Let me just say that Kevin was an amazing waiter.  He was so attentive and friendly.  Our drinks were never empty and he was pleasant the entire time.     Our food choices landed on the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Bucking Bull Fries.  We've previously had the pizza before and wanted to see if it was still to our liking.   Since the last visit, they changed it a little bit by sprinkling the blue cheese crumbles on top instead of the blue cheese sauce.  It wasn't as good as before but still ok.  The pizza itself is huge and can easily be spilt between two people... maybe even three.   We also split the fries which were completely covered by sauteed onions, bacon, cheddar cheese sauce and buffalo hot sauce.  Delicious!  Very messy but we just ate them with forks.  Overall the food was still good enough to dine again.  Dinner and a show?  There is a mechanical bull in the restaurant.  It's free to ride with your paid receipt.  Would I try it?  Probably not but there are plenty of others who aren't afraid to!  We even witnessed a girl in a skirt ride the bull.  It is Vegas right?  This is so entertaining watching people attempt this craziness!  Plus there are tv's everywhere in the restaurant.  It is a great fun atmosphere.  :-)",

I was really excited because my husband and I went to the rockhouse over at the palazzo and had such a good time and I thought this would be the same because they are technically owned by the same person.   I was 100times wrong! We walked in to redeem our groupon and you can only do it at the small rockhouse bar on the left side of the restaurant. We walked up and the bartender was so rude! I wish I had her name cuz I'd call her out but she was a skinny blonde chick with a thigh tattoo. She practically rolled her eyes every time we asked her for a drink and she told another girl to get us wristbands and the other girl seemed so annoyed that she had to do that for us because they were groupons. Ok. We get it. 3/4 of us are servers and we don't like to do stupid sales but it's part of your job. At least be nice about it. I didn't even want to go back and ask her for anything because she had her nose in the air the whole time so I asked my husband to get us drinks.   I eventually went over there to get drinks and the whole time she was making my drinks she was talking to some guys at the bar and saying profanities like it was normal to do that in front of customers. No, it's not. That's nasty and rude. It makes the establishment look so unprofessional. We sat at a table a little ways from the bar and had ordered some food. She didn't come pick up the plates or trays until we were leaving like an hour later and didn't even come over to check on us or offer us condiments or napkins! I had to go up to the bar and get napkins myself. Mind you, this was a TUESDAY AFTERNOON. NO ONE WAS EVEN THERE! She was not busy and could have done so much better.   This place is only getting one star because the food was decent. But service was so awful! I would never recommend getting this groupon. I would however recommend getting the one for the rockhouse at the palazzo.   I will call management about our experience because it was so unacceptable.",

Food was not only NOT good...  It was way overpriced and came out ice cold. We wanted to return it but the waiter (woods was last name on receipt) didn't come back the entire meal and the food took almost 30 minutes to get there in the first place.   We both ordered the $25 combo plates w Mac n cheese and fries as side. Dorito crusted Mac n cheese would have been better if they'd used kraft out of the box. Gross.   The ribs and brisket were both very subpar. Friend got the chicken that was dry and cold.      Bill was $52...  Not the biggest issue with losing the money but more with losing the opportunity to eat at a GOOD Vegas restaurant...  And they are everywhere",

When asked why that long their answer was: it takes long time to cook steak. No sorry we are busy. That why it was even more upsetting when we got the food and the steak was cold and row when asked for medium. The. Urged was cold even the cheese on it was not melted. We were late to our flight and had not time to complaint but I will never go back and I am in Vegas few times a year. Don't waist your time and money here. There are way to many good places around",

    "text": "We were on our way to see Brad Garrett and wanted a quick bite before we saw the show. There are so many places on the Las Vegas Strip it's hard to choose where to go. Originally, we decided we would go to the Spice Buffet, but when we got there and took a look around, it looked like a cafeteria. We left and started walking back down the strip.  The PBR Rock Bar and Grill is outside of the Planet Hollywood Casino. We sat outside watching the end of the Rock and Roll Marathon as the runners were finishing up. Las Vegas Boulevard was closed and thousands of runners had taken control.  The menu is large, and there were a few things that caught my eye. On the suggestion of the server I got the 1/2 rack of ribs. The air was a little cold and there were lots of gas heaters around. There was actually one right over our table, but it had been disconnected because they put a TV too close to it and it was a fire hazard. So, we stayed cold.  The ribs were done so well the meat literally fell of the bone. I was not too thrilled with the barbecue sauce.   The atmosphere was great (albeit cold) and the service was good. The food was average. The prices were reasonable.",

We made plans to stop in the next day for round two. At looking over the check, we thought it was reasonable we drank ate and had a good time. BUT when looking at the TAX... we were taxed 16.5% vs 8.25%. Now I would be fine with it if told upfront. We were told the management needed to look it over. This is happening every day to many tourists and it's just not right!..I say be wary, look over your  check and look over it.  Apparently it's been like this all day and they \"just\" noticed it.",

The chicken had a great lime flavor to them, but for the cost, I felt like they were pretty mediocre. I could have gone to Chili's down the strip and gotten better fajitas for half the price. The guacamole looked like runny baby poop and the fajitas weren't served with any cheese. Brian decided to go out of the box and get the chicken and waffles pizza.  The pizza itself was good, but the chicken and waffles on top were extremely dry and lacked flavor. The service was really good, but the food was nothing worth getting excited about. We shared a fish bowl of margaritas with some friends of ours, which tasted really good. 100 ounces of margarita is a bit much, but they gladly give you to-go cups for any that can't be consumed at the table.",

Hostess did not bother to acknowledge us when we walked up and made us feel as though we should be grateful for their ability to seat us. Once seated we waited 30 mins before a waitress even stopped to say shed be back to get our drink order. Needless to say we got up and walked out. Customer service is lacking. I dont care how great of a place it is. There are another 1,000 just as cool places in vegas. Not worth the time.",

The buckets of beer are the way to go and the potato skins with the pulled pork are Epic!! Thanks Crissy for creating a great place for us to enjoy the games!! We'll be back!! CHEERS!!",

The hostess just pointed us in the direction of patio & we had to piece together some chairs at table for 2 together ourselves because there were 2 people sitting at a table for 6.  That was common for this patio, lots of available chairs but all the tables taken.  Not sure if the open seating patio was the bars idea or our a hostess. The drinks seemed a little weak & they put salt instead of sugar on the rim of my wife's strawberry margarita.  The patio couch we had as our only option (after being asked to move)  was nasty.  Didn't even walk inside, just wanted a few drinks on our way elsewhere & that's what I rated.",

He meet every single request with a smile, all while everyone was moving throughout the tables and restaurant.    Our families raved about how much fun they had, including the 5 children under that age of seven with us.  The food was fabulous, the atmosphere, and music were great.  Of course everyone loved the bull...it was an added bonus.  Every single one our our guests from our 3 year old nephew to my 82 year old grandfather had a enjoyed themselves.  And we didn't have a heart attack when the check came, everyone had their fill of food and drink and it was reasonably priced.  We will be back!!",

Had their $3 beer special which comes out a plastic cup - keeping it classy, college style :) BF has a 36oz strawberry slushy which I think came in under $16, but I could be wrong. Either way, this was by far the most bang for our buck alcohol-wise during our entire trip. Cheapest slushy drink I've seen walking around Las Vegas.   Ordered some buffalo wings to share which were delicious and large. They were fat, huge wings! It was suppose to be a snack but was closer to feeling like dinner even though we only had 10 wings.   Would come here again if I was around Planet hollywood next time I'm in sin city.",

The fried chicken sandwich was good...nothing special.   For dessert we ordered the mini cupcakes on skewers...such a cute idea! 3 were red velvet, 3 german chocolate and 3 had bacon crumbles. We also shared the sundae...so good. A warm, freshly baked waffle below ice cream, bananas and whipped cream.  Yum!  Such a fun place...you should stop by!",

The food was pretty good, but one of my sides was cold. We wanted to order strawberry margaritas and were instructed to order one in this bull cup thing. Already slightly buzzed (we had just 2 drinks by the pool before we came), we agreed. The drink was huuuuuge in souvenir cup I could have lived without but pretty good. I was disappointed to find out they were $28 each when the check came. Overall the check was $106 for 2 ppl to eat and have 1 drink and mind you this is a bar with bar average food. The drink was so big neither of us could finish it and by the time we got back to the room I was sick. I never get sick so this was alarming to me. Not sure if it was the food or sugary margarita that made me nauseated with a splitting headache, but our day ended there, all Vegas night plans out the window!",

One thing to note (I don't know if it's a good thing or bad because listening to someone else's game would be annoying), but there is NO GAME SOUND -- they play music instead.  Like I said, maybe not such a bad thing.  Atmosphere was perfect -- restrooms are IN the restaurant, not across the casino floor --- BONUS!    The food is ok, just ok.  Thus the one less star . . . it's bar food, though they try to make it better than bar food.  Though we only tried breakfast items, so I can't judge too hard.  :)   Beer in a bucket was the special -- $20 for 5 bottles domestic of your choice.  Not too bad . . . don't order draft, those are something like $8/ea and after a bucket's worth, that gets a little pricey for football watching.   They do have some minimums though -- if you come during the early games and stay for the late games, there is a $40 food and beverage minimum that needs to be met for the afternoon.  We had no problems making this with the price of the food/drinks, but just a good thing to know.   P.S. when you've had enough of the games, there is a bull you can try out too. . . . if not for you, watching is always very entertaining!  We did laugh our a**es off at a woman who thought the had it down, but didn't.  Ouch!",

We sat down at the table that was set up for us in the center of the floor and waited for our server. After about 10 minutes of waiting (it was slow) and no water, she came over for drink orders. We put in an order for 6-7 different appetizers and proceeded to make her aware of our Yelp discounts for buy one get one. At this point she directs us to the bar to order our drinks, \"that will take me 20 minutes, you'll need to make your order at the bar and show them your voucher and stormed off. I don't know about you, but it seems a tad unrealistic for 11 people to make their way to the bar to place a drink order. Hence, the reservation. I'd a also like to point out we were not splitting the bill, this would all be on one check.  Seems like a good opportunity for some $$$$, right?  The owner of our company made his way to the front to speak with a manager. He had to wait behind another very unsatisfied customer who was speaking with the manager about the service received. (Bad sign eh?)   He came back to the table, we waited for 5 minutes and no one addressed our concerns or apologized.   Our group of 11 stood up and made our way to Cabo Wabo. Needless to say this was a very poor experience, I would not recommend it (especially to a group).",

Better than your average restaurant/bar food for sure. I noticed some healthy options on there as well but who buys healthy in Vegas! I had a jalapeno burger with sweet potato tater tots. It was so good, I ate the entire . Atmosphere was fun- we got to watch the drunk girls rip their pants and fly off the mechanical bull. The waiter split our checks for us (how annoying that is, very nice of him) and I loved the location. We sat outside (Right near the strip where you can watch everything and everybody go by).  1 star for the food, 1 star for the atmosphere, 1 star for the waiter, 1 star for the management and 1 star for the location = 5",

I had an egg & cheese sandwich with fries which was good but nothing special. Combined with a PBR it makes a real good meal. Especially because the price was pretty decent for Las Vegas.  We visited in the afternoon and various seats were taken. I could imagine it being crowded and party-like at night, because they offer drinking games like beer pong and others. Over all I really enjoyed my visit and would definitely come back again!",

We chose the patio area to enjoy the views. It took awhile to get our orders placed. Once the food came in, the appetizer was brought with the main course. The server didn't bring my son his Mac & Cheese that we ordered for him. He was brought something totally different than what we ordered from the kids menu. So we had to wait an additional 10 minutes until the correct order was brought for my son. We weren't going to eat while he sat there waiting. that would be rude. So we waited until all 3 of us had our plates/bowls in front of us. At least my son's food was comped. At the end of the dinner, I wasn't really bothered. I was not going to let that ruin the start of the weekend getaway with my fam.",

Good food, beer on draft, nice servers, decent pricing.  It's in the middle of the strip, which makes it an easy spot to meet with people staying at other hotels. There's also one of those margarita yard cup fill stations right next to it. Good for anyone ready to continue the days partying on way out :)",

My boyfriend and I split a jalapeno cheeseburger and the taco salad. The burger was cooked perfectly and had great seasoning. The meat was very good. The taco salad was incredible! Not healthy at all but so addictive! What happens in Vegas right? The atmosphere of PBR was casual and fun! Everyone was having a good time! They have picnic tables made to look as if you are eating outside and a mechanical bull that you can ride if you dare! They also have a nice bar attached to the side where you can chill out, play giant jenga and order more drinks after dinner. This is a great casual place to visit in Las Vegas where all feel they are welcome.",

The fact that we were able to get food this early, with no wait and able to have a great time while doing so speaks for itself. But, the food was pretty good as well...and I'm pretty sure it's not because my judgement was a little off. Good food is good food, right?  I ended up getting some type of burger with pulled pork on top. I have no clue what it was called but it was delicious. This is just ingenious. Just writing this review makes me want another one. Wonder if the PBR in Baltimore has one?",

I ordered the bacon and egg grilled cheese and it was heavenly! Everything was cooked perfectly and it got me wondering why I don't make these bad boys at home! Also, their french fries are delicious and perfectly crispy.   The atmosphere is that of your typical sports bar and the service is just fine.

They made us move tables, said we probably can't keep the same server even though we had already ordered. The  manner in which they handled the situation made us feel like pests.

In my desperation, I practically asked every restaurant on the side of the strip if they served tater tots.   But, we finally meandered our way to PH and found the ROCK BAR. My roomie knew of this place because she likes that the alcoholic slushies in the guitar/bud light containers. But, we didn't know they had food. Asked if they had tater tots, answered yes, & we were SOLD - or at least I was.   And from my fuzzy memory, I recall a giant glorious basket of deep fried golden-brown perfection. I really don't think anyone should have that much starch + deep fried food in a 15 minute window. But, I snarfed those puppies down (smothered in ketchup of course) with the utmost satisfaction.   Rockbar has a plethora of drunchie/bar finger food. Yumm-o.",

    "text": "This is the first place we noticed when we arrived in Planet Hollywood for our stay. Rock bar, bull ride, beer pong & flip cup, sounded like our kind of place & we intended to hang out there a bit. Unfortunately we didn't quite have as much free time as anticipated on our holiday as Vegas just seems to eat the hours away.  We did get in there for a bite to eat one day though. It's one of the few places we came across with free wifi for customers which was a massive plus for us since we hadn't been in touch with anyone online all week. The other thing they did, which I really liked, is when we ordered one meal & asked to split it, they actually cut the burger in half & brought it out on two separate plates. Maybe this is an american thing but I had never seen this before so it really impressed me.  It wasn't the best burger I had in the week I was in Vegas & it also wasn't the best pulled pork I've ever had (hence the 3 stars). But the sangria was good (albeit more juice than alcohol) & they also had a member of staff come take pictures of my Fiance & I and give us a small free copy of the one they took (with the option to buy the bigger ones). It was nice to get one souvenir I didn't have to pay a fortune for, even if the picture of the sandwich on the one we got was bigger than the picture of us two!",

My husband and I stopped here for lunch the other day and I wasn't too hopeful about finding a good veggie option on the menu - I was so wrong! Considering this place boasts BBQ and burgers I was really happy they went above and beyond for the vegetarian fajitas adding in loads of fresh veg, all well cooked and seasoned. Plus great drinks specials, good service and an excellent location.",

As soon as he saw us walking in, 4 Hispanics- his whole demeanor changed. He had no customer service skills. We asked if he had Modelos(beer) and he answered,\"Yes, I take it you want them to go?\"(with a smart look in his face) We said no,we sat down and he left us sitting there for over 15min waiting for our beers. When he finally came back,my brother asked how much was it and with a rude tone of voice and shoulder-shrug he answered,\"I dunno.\" I asked for the recipe, he got the recipe, our change and a cup- he placed the recipe and money on the table and slammed a cup over them. This whole time he had a look of discuss in his face(just look at the attached picture), not making eye contact or any short conversation. His vibe, body language, demeanor screamed prejudice!  What a shame that now in these days we are still living and witnessing racism at its best.",

We were seated at our table and were surprised that the table had its own TV to watch the game on plus a plug/charging port for your devices. Our server Kole stopped by our table a couple of minutes after we sat down and immediately took our drink order.  I cannot emphasize enough how fast the service is here. We received our food about 15 minutes after ordering.  I ordered the Triple Turkey Club which was incredible. I have never had a sandwich with so much flavor. The turkey tasted as though it was just carved and it was so flavorful. I ordered fries with a side of cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was so creamy and flavorful as well.  My husband ordered the California Club and a side of Mac n' Cheese. He loved his dish as well. The portions are large, so we were really stuffed.  All in all this is a great little spot and I really enjoyed my food. Highly recommend.",

That being said my boyfriend and I were set directly in the sun, no shade whatsoever and then waited. And waited. And waited some more. 15 minutes passed and finally a girl walked over, I asked for water and said I was ready to order.   About 15 minutes later, my boyfriend went to the restroom and when he came back, we still didn't have water, silverware, nothing. He went to the bar and ordered me a water and I finally waved down a lady and asked for the manager.   The manger informed me a lot of people called in sick and the waitress was working the patio alone. Ok, I understand. Things happen but maybe the manger could have waited some tables too? I will admit I don't know the situation going on with employees working or not but to wait almost 30 minutes for a glass of water is kind of frustrating.   The manager comp'd a beer for each of us and gave us bottles of water to go.  I do appreciate him acknowledging the unreasonable amount of time to get service and explaining the situation. It's not their fault they were short staffed because people called in sick but it could have been handled a bit better in my option.   The food was average at best. Nothing to write home about and we happened to stop in on what was hopefully an off day. I can't say I'd return to give them another shot though.",

PBR has a plethora of seating options as one can sit near the bar or out on the patio in comfy couches. They do take reservations as customers were still getting tables reserved past 11pm. PBR also has live music, which can be loud and makes it difficult to have a conversation,but that's  a duh with any venue that has live bands. The service was slow that evening as it was difficult to get refills or order additional food/ alcohol. For my entree, I ordered the Baked Ziti which comes with bread. The portion size was decent, and the pasta was so-so. I also enjoyed an Angry Orchard Rose which is definitely a sweet drink.  One nice attribute is that several of the alcoholic beverages comes with a souvenir glass, just be sure to ask for a box. So overall a decent place, with a great location and is open in the early morning hours.",

We actually came for a late dinner one night walking back from the Luxor to Paris.  There was no wait to get into the restaurant (score in Vegas on a Friday night) but man was it loud with all the fun they were having in the bar area.  Service was really good and attentive and the menu had a lot of options.  I went with the grilled cheese/tomato bisque and the Hubs went with the steak & eggs (9.95 people).  I was pleasantly surprised at the prices here with everything being mostly overpriced on the strip these days.  The food was pretty good for this type of restaurant.  We came back on Sunday morning actually for breakfast/brunch before heading to the airport since Planet Hollywood is right next to Paris and it was a quick walk.  My husband went for the steak & eggs again, and I tried their breakfast pizza.  I would say the breakfast pizza was okay, and I should have gone with the classic breakfast (4.95).  The service was great again so we would definitely come back if only for the price point here and service, with decent food.",

Drinks came back and were spot on! A little on the strong side but still drinkable. The rib eye was  amazing.  It was very tender and full of flavor, smothered with grilled onion. It was far better than anything I expected.   All in all.  This place seemed like a pretty cool spot.   Got to watch all the wanna be cowboys and cowgirls getting tossed on the mechanical bull.

And, to watch the ladies jiggle on the mechanical bull and the hilarity when somebody gets thrown off.  I gotta say the 100oz drink I had was fairly weak.  I shouldn't have been able to finish the entire thing and not felt that tipsy.  Kinda disappointed that it was more juice than liquor.  The waitresses at the bar were a little less than attentive. But, when they did get to me, they were friendly and smiled.  I like to be served by people who at least look like they enjoy their jobs.  I would definitely say to check this place out - you'll at least get a kick out of watching people get thrown from the mechanical bull.",

You can get frozen daiquiris all over Vegas though so I don't know if these are necessarily better than others. I had two meals here and both were above average but still bar food. It's worth having breakfast here as it's pretty tasty and low cost. The burger was good although nothing that stands out. My only complaint is that there is a Yelp check-in offer of \"buy one drink get one free\" and they refused to allow it to count for non-alcoholic beverages. That's a bit unfair for those that aren't drinking because two non-alcoholic drinks end up costing more than two alcoholic drinks with the deal. They should consider respecting those that aren't drinking or who can't drink and offer something with the Yelp check-in.",

What I really enjoyed about my experience here was the waiter we had. A very nice energetic young lady who was nice & very attentive. She made it a great experience and overall ambiance was cool; tv's to watch all the games on.

I posted a few pictures of the menu of your curious, it's not cheap but nothing in Vegas is! Typically there are guys out front handing out two for one drink cards, grab one and head in and scope it out !

Our food was small portions (except for lots of fries) for a big price, but it's Vegas I guess.  I found a much better value and much better food later at Tacos & Tequila in the Luxor.  Our waiter Thomas A was great, but someone else brought out the food and there was a slight error (which was fixed).

    "text": "\"I remember that night. You had like four daiquiris.\" -- Little Nicky (2000)  Have you ever had an entire yard of strawberry daiquiri? Yeah, entirely too sweet. But, also delicious. PBR rock bar, with an outside bar at the bottom/outside of Planet Hollywood hotel, has many sizes to buy of frozen cocktails.  A few things to note, however.  1) The tables are if you are eating only 2) Get a yard, super yard, Bull, Boot, Guitar, whatever and take it to go and walk the strip with it 3) Go inside, just past the hostess stand for more drink options - the bar only has two drink choices - inside there are 6 or 7 4) You can get additional shots added for cheap  The service at the outside bar was painfully slow - we waited an eternity to find out that they did not have the guitar we wanted, but we should go inside. But I went ahead and ordered since they had a purple yard for me. Little did I know they had better flavors inside.  Lesson learned.  So after I got my drink and went inside to find my friend, I realized the additional flavors. The staff was friendly and happy to offer additional shots to the guitar - 5 for $10, we think? Anyway, we declined and off we went with the guitar full of frozen goodness. 88 ounces is a LOT of sugary drink, but it certainly caused a lot of people to stop us along the strip.",

Within minutes of sitting down, our waitress came over with a horrible attitude. Several members of our party checked in on yelp to take advantage of the buy one get one free drinks and we were looking over our menus for food. The waitress' attitude went from horrible to nuclear and she began complaining even louder that it would take her 20 minutes to honor the yelp offer. Waters were not even served during 5 minutes of waiting further and we could see our waitress venting about us. Keep in mind we were there for less than 10 minutes at that point. We went directly to the manager to ask for a new waitress and after having to wait for a customer in front of us also complain for some unknown issue with their party, we decided to get up and leave. All 11 of us got up and walked out without having ordered one thing. Huge loss for PBR!!!! I have never seen such bad service and will never go back to any PBR... ever!",

Hahaha the girl that was serving us was stale and had an attitude. My boyfriend and I got the pina colada with 2 extra bicardi shots. First of all, the pina colada tasted gross. It didn't even taste like pina colada. It felt like I was drinking a glade plug in! That artificial sweet taste with a hint of lighter fluid after taste. I looked at it and wished I walked the extra few feet to go to fat Tuesday's. Plus, they charge 5 bucks for each extra shot, so my $17 margarita was $27!! And I watched her pour the bicardi into the margarita, it wasn't nearly two shots. The girl didn't even know what rum was. My boyfriend asked what rum she had besides bicardi and she just blurted out everything she had behind the counter with attitude. Wth. Fat Tuesday's extra shot is a $1!! Go there and save yourself from this place. The drinks represent the girls that work there, weak and gross.",

My wife got the Memphis Style BBQ pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and a Hurricane to wash it down with. I got the BBQ Burger which was juicy and a little spicy with the bottomless beer special. Service was great, food and portions definitely worth the price..!   We'll definitely be returning next time were in Vegas. BTW...lot's of TV's to watch any game that's showing. Enjoy......",

The place was snoozeville, and there were maybe 15 people there, including the 6 of us and all the staff. The drinks were a little pricey, but it is the strip...whatcha gonna do? My friend and I ordered 2 top shelf drinks and a cheeseburger and fries to share. Total was about $40 after tip. The fries were good. The burger was (suprisingly) done well.   I was a little drunk, so I can't quite remember...but I think there was a mechanical bull inside, and a lounge type situation that seemed nice. The best part is the tempered glass filled personal gas powered fire pits in the middle of each bar table - this made it very convenient to toss fries, ice, straws and other things into it.  The highlight for me though, was the fact that there was a girl passed out in the stall next to me...wait, that wasn't the highlight....the highlight was when I told the very hot, toned, bronzed bouncer, he just grunted with irritation and sauntered right in...like it was a typical Friday night.

But then again everything on the strip IS. $12 for a drink...meh! Their Southern Hospitality is by far one of the yummiest drinks I've had. Tastes like sweet tea!   Food - we had appitizers. Their fried pickles were pretty good. But their sampler is $20 and you get a TON of food for $20.   The mechanical bull is pretty neat. Costs $5 though. If you eat/drink there you should get to ride it for free, I say.   Service...it's okay. It's slow and the last night we were there the server pissed my husband off. We were told we could sit at a table by the hostess and the server wanted to move us to a \"better table\". Uh, okay. Bye.",

Then, after we were seated separately within shouting distance, we were told it was not possible for one table to buy drinks for another table as they were \"different sections\". It could have been lazy service but, since the rest of the service was pretty good if not great, I suspect it is management. Too many good places in Vegas, skip this one!",

It was a noisy place because of all the music (And for being a rockbar..country music was the last thing I was planning to hear.  The service was fast, and food was just perfect. Only thing I didn't like was the silverware in the glass jar..I didn't know if it was used or what was going on there. There was 2 knifes and a fork in the jar and I was with a friend so that wasn't going to work lol.   When the server came back around I asked for extra silverware and she starts looking in the jar. I guess she thought they had enough in there but they didn't so she had someone come around and give us extra.   The prices are good for the amount of food they give you and it tastes wonderful. Great place to hang with a bunch of friends.",

We stopped in for a quick lunch bite after the girl on the sidewalk offered us 10% off our check.  It was early lunch in Las Vegas, so not much crowd.  The service was quick because of that.  However, a few things surprised us. Our waitress went on break, and another gal came by to check on us (This was a first after a week of eating out) They come by and take your photo, then offer it to you with a souvenir frame.  If you decline, the price WILL get cheaper.  They have a mechanical bull and a tire swing tied to the rafters if you are feeling brave.",

(slightly insulted? yes. i'm 25 but i dont look it. and its NYE! i wonder who else she sold alcohol to...). i paid, i tasted it (it tasted like a big stick popsicle!), and i was stuck wearing this guitar all night.   needless to say, i've experienced better service. much rather go to fat tuesdays!!! and - i ended up getting annoyed with the damn thing and left it at chandelier bar.",

    "text": "Visited this location while in Vegas on business. We wanted to stop for some late dinner grub.  We ordered the bucking bull frys. They were good not as hot or spicy as I was expecting. The chili cheese taters on the other hand were actually spicier than the bull frys. The chili cheese taters were good with plenty of chili. They are not for those light of heart or counting calories. Those have got to be 2000 calories alone lol. There are enough for at least two adults to share easy.   The BBQ hamburger was cooked very well. Served with a perfect medium pink through out. It was a good meal even for bar food. My co-workers had various foods they all enjoyed including potato salad, other burgers, and chicken sandwiches.  The location is loud for sure its a country bar so understand that up front. We sat in the restaurant area to eat. There is a bar side with karaoke and open floor area were people danced.   The server was great full of personality and made good recommendations on the food.   Overall not a bad place to stop in for a bar food night.",

Most of the strip is an expensive place, and you need to adjust your food price meter accordingly.  I've found everything costs about $5-$7 more than it does anywhere else.  My problem with PBR was the food and service...which is too bad given those are sort of biggies at a restaurant.  Sat outside in the lovely little patio right next to the entrance to the Miracle Mile Shops...great people watching.  Got a table quickly and all was well.  Server wasn't unfriendly, you could just tell he didn't care, at all.  We all have bad days, but the indifference was almost insulting.  Out of three meals, one was good (chicken and waffles), one was meh but okay (chipotle chicken sandwich), and one was awful (chicken mac and cheese)...it was a big bowl of mac and cheese soup...so watery my poor wife needed a spoon.  It's dishes like that which make you question if whoever is in the kitchen really cares.  PBR has the total right to serve that nonsense, but we for sure have the right to choose to not come back.  On the whole the mediocre food and indifferent waiter overweighed the great location and patio.",

First off not a big sports fan and there was a game going with a lot of loud rowdy people (who offers a sports bar to theater people? I'm from outta town I'm thinking rock bar will be similar to Hard Rock Cafe). It was so loud in there couldn't even talk to each other. Then as part of the deal our choices were EXTREMELY  limited. We had our choice of salad, salad veggies salad or ribs. I got a cesar salad and they gave me a side since my other option was salad. I picked deviled eggs thinking I  could add them to my salad. But they were hard and tasteless. That was definitely not a cesar dressing it was horrible and the croutons were hard and chewy. Then for dessert we picked strawberry shortcake. It was an old store bought donut cut in half with canned strawberries and whipped cream. HORRIBLE!!!! I would never go back there and never recommend it to anyone. Save your money and your taste buds!",

    "text": "So it's 9pm, we have just come out of a show, and we have not eaten lunch that day. I was HANGRY! I'd had my first full day in Vegas and was craving a spot to eat that wasn't inside under a fake sky. We wandered down the strip, my feet getting sorer and sorer in heels, and we spotted the PBR Rock Bar & Grill. I thought there's a patio, I can hear some good music and there are empty tables, DONE! We sat and waited, waited, waited... no service. So my mother pops up and goes to the bar, thinking she'd order us a couple of drinks and some water (we were real thirsty, 24 hours of air travel the day before will do that). They told her that she had to sit down and wait for a server. We could actually see people going up to the bar and being served, but apparently we were in a service area. So we kept waiting. Still nothing. At this point I was close to hysteria. I'd had about 10 hours sleep in the last three days and I was hungry and thirsty, these things are not a good combination. She went up again and was told \"Ma'am please do not come to the bar again, someone will come to serve you.\" We were almost ready to walk about when a young guy came buy, bringing out someone else's food. We dragged him over and begged him to take our order. He said that he couldn't but thankfully he sent someone right over. FINALLY. Normally I'm pretty relaxed about this kind of thing, people are busy, they're doing the best they can, bar girl was just following the rules blah blah blah, but it should not be that hard to get a glass of water?  We couldn't decide on entrees so ordered a bunch of sides, the corn was awful, but the macaroni and cheese with doritos was super delicious, mashed potato wasn't hot enough, coleslaw was just coleslaw from a packet. Beers were big and well priced. All in all it's not like I wouldn't come in here for a beer and some french fries if I was back in Vegas and was walking  by but it does not bring good feelings to mind when I reflect on this particular encounter...",

The food here is alright; the bucket of wings and tater tots are pretty good as far as finger foods go and reasonably priced considering the prime location.  However, what really appeals to me about PBR Rock Bar are the drink specials, which in my experience are unparalleled on the Strip. They have a different special every night, but I think your best bet is to try and get there for an open bar. Wednesday is open bar for college students (although I think you can still do it for a slightly higher price if you're not a college student) and Sunday night is $10 open bar just for following them on Twitter. You can't beat it!  Oh, and once you've had a few, make sure to ride the bull. If you've ordered food, your receipt gives you a complimentary ride.",

At that point I lost my patience and asked to speak to a manager who had us sat right away but definitely had no customer service skills and she should not be a manager.

The food is very good and they serve a wide choice of diffrent meals. (Burgers, pizza, wings and ribs). Staff was always friendly and helpful.   I can hardly recommand this place. You can have lunch or dinner, go for a good pre-party or just chill outside and looking at the strip. We will definatly turn back here asap. ;)",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here our first night of our honeymoon in Vegas (my first visit)! We stayed at the Aria and this was a very convenient location on the strip! We have friends that come to Vegas annually and had recommended we try here, as it is one of their favorites! After we were seated outside, it did take a little while before we were served, but that was due to the volume of people being there and I think the hostess forgot to tell servers there were people outside :) but after she told servers, the service was VERY attentive and great! The atmosphere outside was great! My husband had the chili dog and he is a chili god snob and he said it was absolutely phenomenal! Also, FANTASTIC fries!! I had the potato skins for my dinner and oh my word!! They were some of the best I've ever had! Great place to eat, we will definitely return! Thanks!",

Our waitress was very sweet (I wish I could remember her name), and the BBQ burger with a side of potato salad was delicious. All of our meals were under $20, as well. We also got to ride the bull which was a ton of fun! Our waitress gave us a couple of vouchers to ride it, so we didn't even have to pay. I would highly recommend this restaurant over the overpriced, not so great restaurants that are so common on the strip.",

    "text": "This meal started off prettttyy rocky...  so our 2 friends went in before us and asked for a table for 6.. we were nearby at another store and our friends called and said we got a table but we have to come asap. so we ran over... (maybs ~5 mins) and when we got there they were sitting at this smallll table for 2 and they told us the hostess gave the booth away and we have to go up to the hostess and get in line all over again. so i went to the hostess and she had a major attitute she was like you guys weren't here so you have to go to the back of the line so we'll get seated after everyone else there (there's like 3 parties).. I was fine with that since we were late and it's pretty busy today so we went back to the small table to wait but within 5 minutes we got asked to move because we were standing over the table.... (we were by the wall so it wasn't like we were blocking anything) AND THIS IS A BAR!!! there's a mechanical bull behind us which made me think this was a casual place... but apparently not... so we moved outside (we considered leaving but it was dinner time and our friends wanted to watch the game so we just stuck around) finally all the parites got seated and then I saw a party leave from the booth so I went to the hostess and asked if we can take that table. she said it was okay. the place was really crowded so we just went over to the table and hooovered around it. soon this waitress came over and was like this table is not cleaned yet you guys need to step outside. she had a REALLY nasty attitude and she even went to the hostess to tell on us. I told the hostess oh I thought you said we can have the table so we just walked over to wait... (we've already waited like 45 mins by now) and we wanted to watch the game and we can't if we're standing outside. (plus there was someone riding the bull and we wanted to watch that too)... but we were like fine... so we stepped out and we were watching the table to see when it'll get cleaned so we Patiently waited.... and then BAM! i see another party walk in and sat on the table. I was like WTF?? so i went to the waitress that told us to leave and I was like i thought u guys said you can't sit down until it was cleaned? these people just walked in and sat down.... at our table.... and the waitress was like OH this isn't my job, you'll have ot ask the hostess (again.. very nasty attitude) I was like so you tell us to leave and then when another party comes in that you like you let them sit (she was their waitress... so obviously she just didn't want to serve us so she made us leave with this bullshit excuses) (also note... they DID NOT clean the table until after those people sat down)... really wanted to leave right about now but my friends already got drinks from the bar and they had money betting on the game and it was mid-quarter so they werent about to leave. FINALLY... we got seated... Our waiter was really nice and the food was good too. I had the chicken and waffle... other than the rocky start... the rest of the experience was good. the game went well and my friends won money from it. the mechanical bull was fun to watch. overall environment and vibe at the bar was casual and fun. food was okay but just your typical bar food.   If the hostess/waitress thing didn't happen, i would've given it a 3 star...",

Dont expect too much though, they have a small menu so you really dont have too much to choose from, but it comes in a big portion. We saw someone order some burger, and it was huge.

I had ordered the steak and eggs.   At least two other parties were seated and ate after me.  25 minutes later - I flagged another server (since mine hadn't checked on me) and asked him to give me the check.  I had enough.  My actual server came and I told her again to get me the check.    10 minutes later the manager came with my plate.    At that point - with my pride and principles - I couldn't touch the food if they paid ME.    The manager apologized and explained that her cook did this to her yesterday too.   Nice to hear I waved and walked out across the way to grab something from Earl of Sandwich.   Had my order in 7 minutes.",

First of all we asked for ice tea we got like literally three pieces of ice each which in Vegas melts in two seconds so warm ICE tea. After that our waiter took our order. We ordered a couple of burgers I got a turkey burger it was pretty good. My husband got a PBR burger asked for meat and cheese only also a side of BBQ he got a burger patty with cheese and no bacon which comes on it, the waiter who we hadn't seen for a while (our food got delivered by another waiter) could not be found so we asked another waiter who was helping someone else close by about the bacon as we were in the middle of asking the other waiter comes up all abruptly and says that's what you ordered. Yes he did order meat and cheese only but bacon is meat right? Also my burger was suppose to come with avocado and it did not have it and he forgot the BBQ sauce. At this point he blames it on the kitchen and goes and gets bacon and avocado from the back and brings it to us. Now his burger is cold and stale and the waiter just dumps the bacon it and leaves. I only gave two stars because of the location I would never eat here again.",

There is a spot for bp with two tables and a dance area that's about 8x10.   The crowd ranges from college kids to midlife crisis OC moms and dads. Very diverse but everyone seemed to get along and do their own thing. We were pretty much there to pregame and replenish spending about an hour there. The open bar was from 9-1 with re-entry. A good idea is to drink at PBR and club upstairs at the Gallery if you're looking to dance or listen to music with a legit sound system.  This place deserves more credit for their amazing deals but overall not a place I'd be hanging out at on a regular basis",

We stood there for 10 minutes, but it was clear this place was so unorganized. I wish we turned  back at that point.    A server didn't approach us for at least 20 minutes. When she did, she didn't apologize for the wait, and was quite rude. The four of us each got a beer, and ordered immediately because it had taken so long already. She forgot half our drinks, which literally took another 20 minutes.  The food took 40 minutes to come out.  Of course, my plate had a 6-inch black curly hair on half of my plate, which was the icing on the plate.  The waitress saw me look in disgust, and it was impossible to miss as it was on top of my eggs/bacon.  I normally don't send back, but I really wanted to.  However, I did not because we would have still been there. So I took one for the team, kept my plate, and ate about 2 bites as I instantly lost my appetite even though I was ravenous.  So yeah- 2 hours, awful service, awful food, and a nice big long hair in my food.  Avoid at all costs. Worst place ever.",

But my daughter asked if we could be moved because I had surgery on my neck only a week before and it was too much air on me. Politely they moved us to another table. Our waitress came and introduced herself and took our drink order. I hope that this receipt is correct it says Allison H. Because she deserves all her accolades. I am a 55 years old other of 4 grandmother of 7. I have been to a lot of restaurants in my life all over the entire United States of America. When I tell you she was the best server I have ever had. Thoughtful, speedy, she listened, she didn't drop and run.  We ordered the Spinach dip, she explained that it came with  potatoe chips and not tortilla chips like at other restaurants. She said they were good and they sure were. My daughter mumbled that they would be some good vinegar and salt chips. Allison brought my daughter some vinegar. She was listening. She went way way beyond the call of duty. The most important thing to me was that she listened. She made sure our drinks were filled on time. We both had turkey burgers. Awesome.  Ask for Allison H. She is the best!",

I called it in and was quoted 20 minutes as my wait time. 25 minutes later I show up there and nobody knows anything about any order to pick up. The host directed me to a bartender, the bartender directed me back to the host. Both question me about who took my order, unfortunately I didn't remember her name but they made it pretty obvious that was more important to them than a solution to the problem. The two of them actually started arguing right in front of me about who took the order and whose job it was to do that. Then another girl comes up and tells me the order was never placed and it would be another twenty minutes from then. I told them to forget it and left. Well today I decided to try them out again. I called ahead to place my order and was quoted the 20 minute wait time. 20 minutes later I showed up and nobody had put my order in! Again! But this time the girl who took my call actually took full responsibility for it and put it in with a rush order. I did appreciate her accountability, but I doubt I'll be back for a while.",

So glad I showed up 15 minutes before game time with no reservations. Been searching the rest of the casino for a table for 8. Now we have no where to watch other than our room.

The outside hostess, CrystaLyn, came over to ask if we had any questions. She spent several minutes with us discussing the menu highlights and answering questions (I still can't wrap my head around chicken & waffles), her pride and enjoyment of working there came through so much we decided to go there for dinner that night. We sat outside, which was about 1/3 full, our wait person, Heather, was right with us for our drink orders and answers. She was personable and friendly. We asked about the morning hostess and she told us they were two of the staff that had been there from day one. You could tell how much Heather enjoyed PBR that this was not just a job for her she loves it. Beyond that our food was outstanding. Hubby had Chicken Caesar, lots of chicken and great dressing. I had BLT w/fried egg. Tons of bacon cooked to perfection, the egg was cooked perfect over hard but not dried out. We also had the deep fried pickles, one of our fav appetizers, and these were the best we've ever had. Next time we're in Vegas this will be our go to place for food, not just for the food but the wonderful service we received. Thanks CrystaLyn and Heather.",

PBR Rock Bar wasn't much different, and it was our last resort after encountering long waits at better restaurants.

The sandwich as a whole was a good portion size, but the flavors were nothing spectacular. I'd recommend spending a little more time doing research before dining out in Vegas, otherwise you'll end up with mediocre meals like this!",

I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of fresh fruit. There was a generous portion of pork and it was tender and juicy. It definitely tasted mass produced though. No worries, that's probably why the food comes out so quickly. The bar area/decor is pretty cool. There's lots of TVs, so this place could potentially be a great spot to eat/drink and watch some games. Very fair food prices. They also got a mechanical bull there, which probably equals wardrobe malfunctions and fun times.   A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

It was always pretty busy, so I thought, let's give it a try.  I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. 2 of my friends got the burger that had fried pickles and my other friend had the club.  The food came out quick and presentation was fine.   The burgers weren't huge, but enough for one person. My burger was just okay. Nothing impressive. The fries on the other hand were very tasty! Prices on the menu were average for a place on the strip.    I won't be going back to this place.  Service was great, but the food is nothing to write home about. There are a lot more places on the strip that are 10 times better.",

It's not the bland tasting cocktails that won't even get you buzzed (I drink about 6 regular cans a day).   Everything tasted like they added a drop of rubbing alcohol into plastic cups of water.  Also the mechanical bull is operated by a girl in the back with a joystick. So I saw this fat chick get on top of the mechanical bull, and at the end, the bull literally threw her into the corner of the padded spot. We thought she was okay at first, but then she wasn't moving. Like unconscious or in a coma or something.  When the staff bouncers got over there to help her up, the fat lady's meathead friends were about to get into a altercation with the lady that was operating the bull. Me and my brother left after that, and then walked across the venue 5 minutes later only to find a police paddy wagon, a ambulance, and a cop car with 4 cops taking down a police report outside.",

We were seated at a table then waited around for approx 15minutes while the table next to us was served. The waitress didn't even make eye contact with us or say hello...doesn't make sense because I don't know how you miss a table of 6 people in a nearly empty restaurant.   Still waiting around with no service we decided to go to the bar while my husband waited at the table. 3 of the 4 were able to get drinks while I waited around and got nothing. Yay me!   Hubby waited at the table and got nothing but irritable so needless to say we left and went straight to Pink's and tore it up.  Thanks Rock Bar, at least the drinks were good according to the people that got theirs.",

Situated right on the Strip, we thought it'd be the perfect spot to people watch. Side Note: People watching in Las Vegas is everything you thought it would be. Bring eye drops because they will dry out from staring so hard.   Anyway, back to PBR. As I said, we sat outside where half the tables were full of pretty chill groups of older people having drinks and appetizers. Our waitress hated everyone. At least, she hated us and the people next to us, and the people next to those people, and the people in front of us. Yep that was everyone. Asking for menus and what brands of vodka was totally unacceptable. The scowls turned to full-on eyerolls when we wanted to order food with our drinks. How dare us. And when we asked to split the check? She nearly punched holes into the computer as she rang us up.   Everyone has a bad day, totally get it. But go punch a bag of flour in the kitchen and suck it up like everyone else. If your day is really THAT bad, stay home. You aren't doing yourself any favors or your tables by being the witch of Vegas. And you certainly aren't receiving any great tips either, ours was below average and came with a note explaining why we undertipped. Personally I can't bring myself to do that... but my dining companions sure could, and did.",

During a busy 6:00PM Friday evening dinner rush, we were seated promptly and our server was quick to address our table, even though NFL wild card weekend was in full swing. Located in the middle of the strip next to Planet Hollywood this eatery had just what we were in need of, some quality noshing food, served up quickly.  What an asset to PBR Rock Bar, our server was.  Joe recommended just what this hungry trio needed with no up-sells, expedient in all facets of serving and with a sense of humor and a smile all servers could learn valuable lessons from. The Chicken Quesadilla had serious amounts of shredded/pulled chicken, pepper jack cheese and decoratively topped with sour cream and pico de gallo.  The House Green Salad was average and pricey for what we were served, so if you are going to go with some greens you may want to avoid that menu item.  The half order of the House Made Chili totally nailed it as one of our finicky and modest eaters did not come up for air from his cup. Another stellar recommendation, in that the cup was more than enough to satisfy in our servers opinion and he was spot on. For 4.95 you will be hard pressed to find a much more filling and hearty meal. (Thanks for offering a taste buddy, no I did not want to try it--sarcasm)  As a pizza traditionalist, I was not about to order a Buffalo Chicken Pizza, what happened to the old staples of meatball, sausage, anchovies, yet PBR does offer a pepperoni pizza. Well you can teach an old dog new tricks or serve him up a perfectly cooked, hand tossed dough with chunks of chicken, heap on the mozzarella and hit it with crumbled blue cheese.",

There were several choices for us on the fixed price menu and we both ended up choosing the pulled pork sandwich. I was originally going to try the chicken pasta dinner but our server said it is so super spicy that he always steers people away from it. I like a little spice but not too much so I appreciated that advice. He also let me know that the menu was outdated and the dessert choice of the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was much smaller than before and only had one scoop of ice cream. That was fine and I was thankful for the heads up. The food was good but we were traveling and attending the show right after so we were not able to take our leftovers home. There were a couple of drawbacks to our experience. The music was super loud and we were not able to really talk to each other. The server attempted to get a second tip from us and we are generous tippers but we knew that the gratuity was included with our dinner and show package.",

    "text": "I registered just to post this review.  In my entire life I've never been treated like my friend and I were at this bar last night. I've been going to bars my entire adult life and I've never seen or heard of anything even close to this.   The bartender flew into an absolute rage at us for no reason. We were both calm and reasonable. I attempted to find out what we had done to offend him, but he refused to tell us and continued his rampage, throwing glasses and bottles into the trash behind the bar and stomping around. He was in a barely controlled rage for 15 minutes. He called my friend a crybaby for pointing out to me that the overhead mister was dripping onto the bar. He refused to believe me when I said that my friend and I had were having our first round and couldn't have complained about the dripping water more than once - not that either one of us were really bothered by it, and all my friend did was warn me about it. When I finally asked for my change because I refused to leave a tip for him - I left $20 for two $9 bud lights - he angrily threw my change on the bar and screamed, \"Now beat it!\" at us and we left.   I am completely baffled at what caused his tirade, but there is no excuse for it. I've never been treated like this in my entire life.  I have no other explanation other than the bartender has severe emotional problems. I would skip this place unless you enjoy being berated for no discernible reason.",

    "text": "I stopped into the PBR Rock Bar on Sunday late afternoon to catch a hockey game and a bite to eat before making the drive back to LA.  I got there around 5 and found a seat at the bar in front of a TV that was playing the local news.  The two bartenders basically ignored me for a good 5-7 minutes.  They both seemed pretty bored and miserable, but at least one of them was hustling, so I respected that at least.  When one finally came over, I asked if they would turn the game on, because I did not want to order anything if they could not.  She said 'sure let me find out'.  A few minutes later the other bartender noticed me, and asked if she could 'help me'.  I said that I was waiting to see if I would be able to get the hockey game on.  She replied with \"no we can't do that.\"  I was up and out of my chair, and it is a good thing the manager showed up then to turn the game on for me, otherwise I was gone and this review would have been much worse.  The manager accommodated me, but also seemed like she did not want to be bothered.   The food was typical and pretty unmemorable.  I was debating between the buffalo chicken sandwich and the BBQ Cheddar Chicken Sandwich, so I asked the bartenders opinion (as usual), and she recommended the former, so I gave it a shot.  I had finally gotten her to lighten up and be a little friendly by this point by being the nice affable guy I am.  The sandwich consisted of frozen chicken dropped in a deep fryer and coated in buffalo sauce with toppings.  It arrived with the chicken half off of the bun with everything falling off of it.  It was not the most appetizing. I fixed it the best I could and some bites were pretty good with the crumbled bleu cheese nicely complimenting the buffalo sauce.  Mostly though, I was unimpressed.  The mechanical bull looked fun, but I was honestly a little turned off by the initial service and food.  The patio looked pretty cool though and I would return for drinks and to hang out there if people were staying at Planet Hollywood, but I would not go out of my way to come back.",

Very rock vibe, hence the name.  Came here again few days later for our last meal before heading to the airport. I had the pulled pork pizza. It was delicious but way too big for one person.   My boyfriend had the Fried pickle burger. I had a bite of his and liked it, but he wasnt crazy about it. Our waitress was extremely nice though [forgot her name, but a very tall blonde]. She brought him 2 kinds of BBQ sauce, both of which he wasnt crazy about though. [Hes a chef and very picky!] All in all, a good experience though! Plus it was located right at our hotel, Planet Hollywood.  I wanted one of those ridiculously obnoxious touristy guitar drinks, but they were very pricey! [I think $35-38] Instead I walked to the casino where I got free drinks. LOL",

    "text": "I was in Vegas this weekend with a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. We stayed at Planet Hollywood and decided to hit up the PBR Rock Bar & Grill on our way out and to get our bride to be on their awesome mechanical bull.   We had a reservation and they seemed to not be able to find it, but got is up pretty quickly. The host were friendly, asked how our bachelorette party was going so far and were very helpful.   Once we were sat the next half hour SUCKED. I don't want my rant to be the firsxt thing you read so if you'd like to hear about our shitty server read about him at the end.   After 45 mins, barely getting our water, going to the manager 2 times already.....I go to the manager once more....I feel like a bitch but come on. The manager says he (Kim) and the other manager (Josh) will go ahead and take care of our table personally. By the time I get back to our table Josh is handing out our shots he said he wanted to compliment us. This got our mood going back in the right direction and our order was placed and we were on our way to an awesome dinner. The food was amazing, I had The Boss Salad, and the fried pickles and jalapeno poppers were great. The other girls loved their food as well. The managers both checked on us ever couple mins, filled waters, cleared plates, go utensils, and brought everything we needed. The manager Josh looked like Clark Kent and one of our girls even told him so, he took it with a chuckle but didn't open his shirt, so who knows, he might be! The bussers were very helpful along side the managers, and definitely saved the day!   Thanks Josh and Kim for making it up and turning a disaster around! Josh even brought us bull riding tickets and we got our bride up on that bull! If it hadn't been for the dick server, this would have gotten 5 stars. Loved the food, environment, host, bussers, bull, and of course the managers. Say hi to Josh and Kim if you go by and let them know you heard about them on Yelp.  The bad parts of dinner: Our server took a few mins to approach us, and said he'd get us a round of waters, while he was there a host came up saying they could hook us up for a better table outside. We said that sounded great and would wait to order our food until we got out there. We waited 10 mins, no water, busser came by with water and the server sent him away with our water saying we were moving. (maybe he didn't want to carry our water outside?) Waited 10 mins, no water. I mentioned it to our server again and jokingly said maybe we should be given shots since we've been waiting so long for water. Waited 10 more mins, still no water. I'm at this point thirsty and annoyed and all the girls are talking about how long it's been. I go to the host, ask for a manager, explain what's going on, and they said they'd tell the manager. We have a manager stop by, I explain what's going on, and he said he'd get us a round of shots.   We see the manager by the back talking to the server and look at us, so I know he's talking about us. Waited 10 more mins, still no water, and we haven't seen our server. We grab a busser and ask for water and have it within 2 mins. I go to the host stand again and this time a new manager is walking up and I explain our situation. I couldn't believe we had been there so long and had barely gotten our water. The manager says he'll take care of it and we see both managers then talking to the server. I think the servers name was Tony? Not sure he even told us. He then comes to our table, confronts us by starting with, \"What's the problem here, I got you your water, I thought you were moving, it's not my fault\". He then asks us if we want a new server and as everyone is just looking down because they can't believe we're being confronted, I blurt out a yes please and he turns around and storms away. This server is going to lose the restaurant business. How ballsy for him to confront his table like that.",

    "text": "2.0 Stars  PBR Rock Bar & Grill is located at the Miracle Mile Shops inside Planet Hollywood, directly on the Las Vegas Strip. My buddies and I originally wanted to check out Pink's Hot Dogs, but the line was way too long for us to wait. We decided to give PBR Rock Bar & Grill a try since there was no wait and we saw all the LCD screens on the walls. There must be more than 40+ screens spanning the whole establishment. That was pretty crazy.  For my order I tried the Memphis Style BBQ Pork sandwich that came with a sesame seed bun and fire crack coleslaw for $10. I was thinking about ordering the coleslaw as my side, but then I noticed it already came with it in my sandwich. I ended up picking Fries as my side. The other side selections available include:  Fries, Potato Salad, BBQ Baked Beans, or Fire Cracker Coleslaw   The sandwich was very mediocre. The bun was not even toasted and it got soggy fast from the coleslaw. The pork was not flavored very well and was pretty bland. Half way through eating my meal I had to just eat the pork and coleslaw filling because the bun was just that unappetizing.  I might have just picked the wrong dish at PBR, but my friends said their dishes were also 'eh, so-so'.  I think I'll only come back to PBR to try riding their mechanical bull, not their food.",

    "text": "A friend and I have been here today since 5pm to watch the Martinez vs Cotto fight, since they were advertising it for free we thought it would be fun to go out and watch the fight (we normally order PPV at home). When we arrived around 5pm we asked where te fight would be showing inside or outside the bar, and the two staff members at the entry said both inside and out, we asked if we needed to seat ourselves or if they seated us they told us to help ourselves, but let us know there are no tables and there is only standing room. When we walked inside they were playing hockey on every single tv except the small 20\" one in the corner by the entrance. All but 4 tables were full and the four open tables had reservation signs on them. So we walked back to the front and asked if we could reserve a table for the fight and they said they are not taking reservations, I asked why they have reserved tables then and they said people reserved those online, and suggested us grab a table as it opened up. About 30-40min later two spots at the bar opened up and there was a tv screen displaying Martinez vs Cotto on the picture and we asked the bartender when they were going to turn on the fight, the bartender said she didn't know and would ask, about 10 minutes later she comes back and says they are ably playing the fight inside, irritated we go and ask the guy who originally told us it was playing both inside and out and he said due to us having the fight for free and the high demand of people asking they have decided to charge people to enter to watch the fight and it's only playing inside. We were like okay so now we have to go try to find a spot inside? I asked if we. Plus pay to reserve a table and he said no they are not doing that just making people pay to walk in and stand. We went back inside and searched for a table, all of them were full except for the reserved ones in the middle of the bar. We wended up making friends and sharing a table, they were here to watch hockey and planned on leaving when it was over. We orders fries and a Caesar chicken wrap, both were absolutely disgusting. The fries were soggy nearly dripping in grease and the wraps had mostly lettuce and the small amount of chicken was soggy as well. Our waitress was very nice, busy with so many people in the bar. I had to ask several times for someone to turn the fight on at least one of the TVs near me, After about 2 1/2 hrs at our table enjoying our new friends and watching the prelims of the fight another waitress walks up and asks one of the people at our table if they were here to watch the fight or just hockey and that she was just wondering the guy let her know he was here for the hockey. I looked over and said I bet they are gonna try to give away our table after the hockey game! everyone at the table laughed. Literally like 15 minutes later another waitress walks up and is trying to put a reserved sign in the middle of our table, I said wait a minute, we are hear to watch the fight? She said we would have to leave because someone reserved the table. I then started getting mad! I was like NO I've been here since 5PM trying to get a table and some service so we can sit and watch the fight I told her I tried paying for a table hours ago and you guys said your not taking reservations! She the. Went and got the girl who asked one of the guys at the table if he were just watching hockey or the fight and I looked at her and said, you asked him not us! We have been here for hours. She then began to argue with me about speaking up next time if we were planning to watch the fight! I told her that she specifically said she was just wondering not that she had planned on giving our table away!! She just took the reserved sign off out table and walked away, didn't even apologize or anything.. I would say the food is gross, and over priced for the quality of food. this place is poorly managed, every single staff member said something different about what was going on several times and they probably shouldn't have False advertisement outside the bar about showing a PPV fight for free if they were charging people and kicking people out who didn't pay for a table to watch the fight. I will not be returning as a local not will I suggest any friends to go to this sports bar!!!",

All of the wait staff were friendly and would stop to check if we needed anything.  it was a bit loud, but what bar isnt.    The sunday afternoon when we ate there it was busier than Friday afternoon.  I would assume because of the games on tv.  Although it was busier it didnt show with the service.

It was so small that we had to put menus that stayed on the table on the floor so we could have a spot to eat at. I asked the hostess for the booth and she said that it was for the larger parties. I'm looking like what the fuck are we.  I ordered the whole BBQ rib fries and onion rings. When they put the rib on the table, I could not believe that this rib was white!!!!!  White as if they had but it in a pot and boiled it! It didn't look like it was bbq at all. I got the manager, and he said it looked like that because he ran out of hickory wood chips.!!!!! I guess he thought we couldn't tell the difference between a BBQ rib and a one that was boiled. Then after all that complaining, we look over and that empty booth was being occupied by..... You guessed it, a party of 4! Well I guess if we would of been any blacker, we would had to eat by the dumpster...... I sat in disbelief to see a waiter walk buy with.......... Ooooohhhhh yeah, you guessed it. A BBQ rib that was cooked the right way. You know, that wasn't boiled and didn't gave the same complexion as Michael Jackson. That rib the waiter had look just the the picture on the menu. I can not believe the service here at this place. I just wanted to take my wife  on a decent place for b-day. Fuck this shit hole!! If I could give this place no stars I would. The hostess, and manager can take that one star that they sure as hell don't deserve and stick it up their ass till it reach the back of their teeth. Fuck off!",

    "text": "Sometimes in life, you just have to punch yourself in the nuts.    And the PBR Rock Bar & Grill is a great place for that.  You see, they have a large bar inside and a decent sized bar outside.  Happy Hour provides good drinking for cheap. (for Vegas)  Then, when it starts raining and you go inside, and the girls you're failing so miserably to pick up sit at the counter ouside of the mechanical bull, you HAVE to ride the thing to impress them.  I've ridden one before...in khakis and boxers.  Big mistake.  Anyway, you basically just get to junk punch yourself over and over until you have the worst sideache ever, or you actually fall off.  I fell off after two junk punches.  But then something funny happened.  Two shots and two beers later, I magically could feel my testicles again, and felt I needed to show off for the two girls one last time.  Plus, my friend got there and said he needed video of me junk punching myself since he wasn't there the first time.  So, back on it and this time I said, \"Take the pain!  Take the pain!\"  And I did...for far too long, until I got 360'd at a very high rate of speed and flew 20 feet.  I'm not sure if the girls were impressed, (doubt it) but my friend bought me a drink.  The end.",

They had live country music which was good, it added a fun atmosphere to the bar. I'm rating this place a 1 star because they OVERCHARGED ME $30. I've been called and they keep telling me corporate will call me, so I called corporate because it's almost been a month. It goes to voicemail all the time..  I ordered those two things with two drinks. My total came out to $43.00. I tipped $7. So it would be $50. Well a couple days later when I'm leaving I'm checking my account and I realize that they charged me a flat $80! If they were to just give me back $30, I would've never made his huge complaint.

However, one for found a long black hair in her guac, which was pretty gross. The staff seemed truly apologetic and our waiter was great about everything. She was given a new sandwich, and it was taken off her bill. Hopefully this was a one time incident, because the staff was really nice and the food tasted good.

The first time I went I ventured in here because me and my friends watched a touristy Facebook video showcasing their huge drinks. Said drinks are expensive but not even three great drinkers can finish them. It tastes like a fishbowl but it certainly looks like an aquarium. One time we got together with a group that couldn't finish theirs so we tried to help each other out because after drinking that logic makes complete sense. The staff here must see it all because not only do they have drinks, but they have a mechanical bull and every purchase you make here gets you a free ride on the bull. How fun! Keep your receipts as riding on the bull gets more fun as the night progresses. Also usually someone is handing out cards with happy hour specials for this place. Take it because something there's even a discount. Me and my friends make a habit of visiting this place every time we're in Vegas.",

We split a fishbowl drink and they offered to put them in to-go cups for us.   Overall: good starting spot to get some food and start drinking.",

    "text": "I had NO INTENTION of eating here, until someone handed me a 2 for 1 drink coupon.  It also helped that I could see my favorite soccer team (L.A. Galaxy) was playing on a few of the televisions.   Overall, this is a decent place.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed the numerous televisions, along with the friend conversation of the other patrons.  The atmosphere is fun and raucous!  What would one expect from a place that has a mechanical bull.  You will find that the vast majority of the crowd is tourists.      PBR has an array of seating options, sit at the bar, at one of the high top tables, or out on the patio on the comfy couches.  FYI, they take reservations, but as a party of 1 it didn't really matter.   Another benefit is that PBR has live music, which can be loud and makes it difficult to have a conversation with your table, but again, I was solo so I had no issues.  It only interfered with me calling out for another beer.      The service was a tad slow, seemed like the barkeep was the only guy working in the area, plus he was filling drinks for all the dinner tables, so he was busy.   For my entree, I ordered the brisket dip with sweet potato fries, it was excellent, and plenty filling.  I also enjoyed two Stone IPA beers, one of my favorites, which they have on tap and they come nice and cold.    Overall this is a decent place with plenty of craziness going on, just don't expect the service to be too fast.",

Drinks were good. Apparently it is cheaper to get shots in the light up shot glasses than just regular shots. (Strange, but hey I now have a lightup shot glass.)   I was a bit disappointed that they were out of two things I wanted, raspberry for their raspberry mojito and something else I can't quite remember.   Although service was slow, it was a fun atmosphere and seemed to have a good crowd. Random couples slow dancing to rock music, fancy artists and everything in between. I'd probably be back, the shots were good and the drinks they had ingredients for were decent.   (Birthday cake shot, and the shot with crown. Vegas vacation drink was good. My friend got regular beer and whiskey drinks and had no complaints.)",

    "text": "Good afternoon world.  I would like to tell you about the worse dining experience of our 10 days in Las Vegas. To be fair I will start with the high points. The manager responded quickly, the hostess was polite and the fried pickles were amazing. That about covers what has gone right with this visit. Now for the bad news.  The first table that our party of six were pleased at was broken unstable and was supposed to be out or service says the manager. \"They are not supposed to use that table and they know it.\"  Once we were placed at a more sturdy  table  orders were taken.  Order 1) Fried pickles (amazing) PBR Burger made to order. So far so good.  Order 2) Jerked Burger cooked to order. Good job Order 3) PBR Burger cooked to order with a side of mac & cheese ( not sure which box that was made in but I am sure if it were served hot it would have tasted better. Order 4) PBR Burger med rare ( cooked to hockey puck status.) Order 5) Jerked burger cooked to order with cold sweet potato fries. Yuck Order 6) Cowboy Steak $33 Ribeye. With carmelized onions portabella mushrooms garlic mashed potatoes sweet corn and a side fresh fruit. Round one of this one was almost recognizable no onions mushrooms the corn was on the cob the garlic mash was cold. Here is where it gets good. I own a restaurant and the table was full of service industry personnel. We were just going to deal. Then the server started talking. As the food was being placed we corrected who ordered what. Quote from server. Misstep1: Take it easy lady I got this. !?! Misstep2: As he handed the plate his thumb was on touching the food. Misstep3: As he attempts reach over the plate of guest 4 she asked him not to his quote \"I wash my hands like 45 times a day.\" After we spoke to the manager the majority of the items were fixed. I feel bad for the manager she had to visit multiple tables with similar issues. At the end of this argues meal there is the opportunity to ride the bull in the resturant. We attempted do just that and were told only one ride per reciept. Di I mention 6 Orders. I would not I repeat would not  recommend this place to anyone for anr reason.",

One night we were hungry for a late night meal and didn't want to go far. We started with an appetizer of the bull shrimp, but I can't remember anything that stood out about it. I had the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese, and my friend had the smoked brisket dip sandwich. Both were good but not great or outstanding. Same for the mac and cheese. I used my check in on Yelp for the BOGO drink. The drinks were good, but when I went to the bar to get them, the bartender was brusque when explaining which drinks I could order with my check in offer.",

The only drawback is that drinks are measured depending on which bar you go to and can be pretty pricey at times. Ladies should always check them out on Thursday for ladies night where the well drinks are $1!",

They serve breakfast, which looked like it would be good.  One thing is that the beer prices made very little sense - $7 for a Coors Lite but $6 for an Angry Orchard?

I promise you won't be disappointed.   I had the Jalepeno burger and Cheryl had the pulled pork sandwich. There was so much pulled pork on that sandwich that she took half of it back to the room.

    "text": "This place is just inside the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. My friends and I were walking by on Saturday night when a club promoter stopped us and gave my friend and I free entry to their club and a buy one/get one drink coupon. So we said why not, let the guys walk off, and went inside.  The club part is this little squared off section partitioned from the actual restaurant by sound proof black walls, but they're technically connected. And while the restaurant has all the trappings of a country bar (with a mechanical bull and country music playing) the club side is GHETTO. I'd feel safer at a dive bar just off the strip than in there. It's loud and gross, cups and garbage everywhere and there's not a lot of space. Most of the dance floor is taken up by a metal cage you can dance in, but there were mostly drunk girls barely hanging on to the poles and twerking to crappy music. It was nothing even decent to dance to.  3 beer pong tables are squished across from the club's bar. Nobody regulates them and I'm pretty sure nobody has cleaned the tables or cups in days. The bar itself.o .. I have NEVER had such bad service. Two female bartenders (wearing just a bra I might add) were talking sh*t and goofing off, not paying attention to customers. My friend and I sat there for more than 5 minutes waiting for service while nobody else was even at the bar... I'M SERIOUS. I practically had to wave my credit card in their faces, and finally they deigned to look at me.  So I showed the girl our drink coupons (buy one/get one for well drinks or beers on tap) and asked for whiskey. She grabs Crown Royal off the top shelf and starts pouring without asking!!!  Crown. Royal. When clearly the drink coupon is for well, and I didn't ask for any name brand. I had to yell at her to stop and give me a well brand, and she got pissed and threw the Crown away and then poured me a 1/4 shot of whiskey and charged me $7 for it.  1/4 shot. For $7. After trying to scam me for Crown Royal.  After that we just wandered over to the restaurant bar and sat there for another round, but were wholly disappointed. Never again!",

Live events, bar, bull rides, outside dining, foot long hot dogs, and custom cocktails in cups the size of punch bowls (no not joking and its $65) had a nice service experience; friendly and considerate staff. I recommend the Taco Salad as an appetizer. Personally ordered the PBR Burger and was not disappointed. 2 mojitos, 2 burgers, and a taco salad for a total of $40, not bad for right on the Vegas strip. If you're craving BBQ style food in Sin City then this is a place worth trying. Yeeha!",

We approached the waitress at the main restaurant and said we wished to get an order of wings to go. She said we could do that through the nearby Daiquiri Bar. What kind of restaurant doesn't allow the hostesses to place orders to go?! Ridiculous.  We sauntered down to the bar (a mere 5 feet away) and placed our order. When the server (Alisha H.) handed me my receipt, I asked about my change and she said that they don't give change and she assumed the dollar I'd mistakenly overpaid was a tip.  I'm not sure what kind of policies the PBR Rock Bar has implemented when the staff is stealing your money to get tips-- This is the direct reason for the one-star rating.  I've also e-mailed their GM and I've received no response yet in 24 hours. Honestly, with the treatment we received, I'm not expecting a response.  Wings were ok. Overpriced but ok.  Will definitely be going elsewhere when we return to Vegas.",

    "text": "I'd like to give this place two stars based on my first experience with this place but alas you are only as good as your last encounter PBR Rock Bar.  I know you can do better as you have!  The original time I went here was a year ago for my Sister's 21st bday.  We sat in the outside patio area and had a blast!  The waitress was awesome, drink specials were decent and the atmosphere was great.  So when we were in Vegas for 4th of July weekend this year, again celebrating a 21st bday this time for my cousin, we were super excited to go back here.  It was a Sunday and they had all these advertisements for something like $10 all you can drink from 9pm-1am.  As it was almost 9pm we asked one of the hype women standing out front of the outside bar that was yelling about the special.   (I call them hype women as I don't think they were waitresses and they didn't know enough information to be a hostess.) They said yes come back at 9pm and for $10 we could drink until 1am.  PERFECT!  So we came back around 915pm and grabbed a seat at the outdoor bar.  Once we sat down the waitress came up and we inquired about the special.  This is where it went downhill, FAST!  She told us that the special wasn't for the outside bar it was only for inside.  Umm OK?!  So we went inside and asked the snotty hostess there about it.  She said she had no clue what were talking about to which we pointed to the sign right next to her stating the special.  She pointed us down the hall and said to ask down there.  We walked a few feet to another entrance.  Upon entering this rundown, hole-in-the-wall looking area we saw an empty bar to our right and a couple beer pong tables to our left and another bar behind them.  There was an employee moving tables and cleaning floors and then a few couples playing beer pong - no one else.  A waitress finally walked up to us to see if we needed help and we again brought up the promotion, which we found was Twitter driven so you had to become their Twitter fan in order to partake.  Side note here: I have done this type of promotion in Vegas before and they ALWAYS SUCK!  You will get every line in the book about why you aren't applicable - \"we ran out,\" \"We served all we can on that promotion,\" \" where did you see that at?\" etc, etc - it's only to get you in the door and they figure since you are there you will spend money!  Ok back to the terrible service at PBR - so the waitress gets the GM/Promoter of this special to help us.  This guy walks up to us doesn't introduce himself and is as cold as can be.  He asks what we need and we AGAIN repeat why we are there.  He asks if we all have a Twitter and we say yes and that we understand the promotion.  Then he looks to my cousin who is wearing a tank top and asks if he has another shirt to put on.  Now keep in mind it's July, in Vegas, and 120 degrees outside.  No my cousin says to him and the guys says Oh well then we can't serve you.  We inquire about the three guys playing beer pong ALL in tank tops and he says that they aren't here for that promotion.  WTF?! What do you have to wear a suit now to a rinky dink, drab bar in order to pay $10 to drink all  you want of their watered down well drinks?!  That was the last straw - we left all quite irritated.  If he didn't want to make the $50 he could have off of us and if he wanted to lessen the servers/bartenders tip money that night so be it.  If he is the person running this place I honestly want to have nothing to do with it.  Word of mouth travels fast and I've already recommended a few good places (AHEM Peppermill) to friends on their way to Vegas this Summer and rest assured PBR Rock Bar is NOT one of them.",

This is the place to go we were told and boy were they right. The mechanical bull really was exciting. Our server was Joshua P. He was really great with drink suggestions and food selections. We had a picky eater in or group and he helped find just the right thing for her. He was really on top of refills and we had fun chatting with him. He's one of the best servers I've ever had and I would definitely recommend him as a server to anyone considering eating here. Thanks!!",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place 0 stars. So many problems, no redeeming qualities. I'll do it in list form. 1. We put our name down with a group of 12, they gave us a buzzer and told us 30 min. When we came back after 20 min to check on the status of our table they said oops, someone came up and said they were you so we gave your table away. Our buzzer didn't even go off. We didn't want to wait any longer so we split into 2 groups. 2. One girl in our group had celiac (gluten intolerant) so she asked the waitress if a menu item was gluten free. The waitress didn't know so my friend asked if she could check with the cook, and she said she would. My friend forgot to double check that she had asked the cook, but the waitress clearly did not check, and my friend was in bed with a horrible stomach ache all day long. 3. I ordered grits (because that's what I like when I'm hung over) which were $3, I asked for cheese on top. The cheese on top was an additional $3. $3 for cheese??? That's f&%king ridiculous. 4. Out of 6 people at our table, the waitress forgot to put in 2 of the orders. How do you forget 1/3 of the orders?? So they came out like 20 min after the others. Granted, we weren't charged for them but by that time we just wanted to get the hell out. 5. No one liked their meals that much, food was just blah. Go to earl of sandwich across the way, sandwiches are better and your expectations for service are lower so you aren't disappointed.",

    "text": "I was hanging around the planet hollywood sportsbook watching the basketball game I had money and I was getting real hungry and decided to stop at pbr rockbar to eat as Im always walking past it but never stop in. All the waitresses are hanging around by the entrance trying to get people to come in which is kind of annoying. It was dead as it was only 4pm, but I just wanted to go sit at the bar, eat, drink, and watch the game. As I was just walking towards the entrance a waitress asked if I wanted to come in and eat, I said yeah that I was just going to the bar, she says no you're sitting at my table in my section, as she was kinda cute I got guilted in and said ok. She sat me at the table right next to the entrance which was more annoying as it was further away from any tvs. I told her I wanted to watch the game so she had the manager change the closest tv to that game, which the tv was far away and I couldnt really see it anyways. The waitress was very friendly as she made several recommendations and was very upbeat and energized. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with no blue cheese, and of course when it came out it had blue cheese on it, which I cant stand. But I just picked it off. Waitress came by to see if everything came out the way I asked and I told her it came with blue cheese on it and she asked if I wanted to return it to the kitchen and have them remake it, I said no its not that big of a deal as I can just scrape it off. It was a monster piece of chicken, part of which was just bad meat which I was immediately disgusted by, it was served on a brown wheat type bun which is strange and tasted like shit. This place seems like a cool place to drink and party as it has a college bar atmosphere which I like, but as far as the food (atleast that day or maybe just what I ordered) was not very good.",

They of course had a mechanical bull and it was fun to watch people attempting to ride it. My favorite part though, had to be the beer pong tables that you could play on. You could buy a pitcher of beer and play right there in the restaurant. No need of trying to find a way to play in your hotel room. Overall, it was a great way to start off a night in Vegas.",

    "text": "DO NOT GO IN THIS PLACE!!! I made a yelp account just to write this review for this horrid place.  I never knew I could get the WORST POSSIBLE SERVICE EVER, especially in Las Vegas.   If you're thinking bout eating in here, TURN AROUND and go to Pinks just outside or Lobster me next to fat tuesday.  I ate here with my friends Friday 2/10/12 for breakfast and we were sure in for a treat. We got seated right away and asked for orange juices all around. 5 minutes later someone comes to take our order: 2 Classic Breakfasts, Sausage Biscuits, Bucket of Wings, Steak & Eggs, and Breakfast Skins (Potato Skins). Waiter comes back with waters all around, still no orange juice. 15 min later.. Bucket of wings come out; pretty good, not the best but still somewhat satisfying. (Still no orange juice)  20 minutes have gone by no orange juice and still no food at our table. We're getting restless and impatient. Since no one bothered to ask us for refills we asked one of the waiters passing by to see if our food was ready. Another 5 minutes later, our food has arrived.   Classic breakfast - Eggs were cold. Not hot. Not warm. Cold. Tater tots cold. Bacon was the only thing even close to warm.  Sausage biscuits - You can tell by the look of congealed formation of skin on the gravy on the biscuits that it was only possible to achieve this look from sitting around too long. Not to mention that the biscuits were getting harder by the second. Hopefully they think twice before putting their biscuits in the microwave.   Breakfast skins - Looks nice. No sour cream?? Potato skins were not even baked long enough, no crisp whatsoever.   Steak & Eggs - Asked for medium rare, came out well done.  After all our food was delivered, we had to ask for our orange juices. We couldn't even finish our food because of the low quality of food and service. I don't understand how you can eat at a restaurant and not even get asked \"how's everything tasting?\" \"would you like refills?\" \"everything come out ok?\" not once.   After we asked for the check the busboy had was cleaning the table, literally everything while we were still sitting down. Picking up silverware, napkins, dishes, and even wiping it down while we were trying to pay. Couldn't it have waited till after we left?   I would never come back to this God-forsaken place. Worst quality of food. Worst possible customer service. Worst lack of integrity for a restaurant.   Save yourself the time and eat at pinks 2 min away or lobster me down the walkway, you won't regret it.",

We went to this place since it served breakfast all day and was conveniently located. We ordered our food and awaited what we thought to be a great breakfast. Oh were we wrong. First off, I had a basic breakfast with eggs, bacon, toast and tater tots. The eggs were decent at best,nit sure if they were real eggs. The bacon had no flavor whatsoever and the tots were fried to a crisp. I had to eat them with my hands since I tried to use my fork and a few almost flew off my plate. Toast was the only thing on my plate that was good. I was starving so I ate most of it. My friend only touched his plate. When I told him to hurry and eat so we can start drinking he said the same exact thing I did. He ordered the Lumber Jack Scrambler and it had no taste whatsoever. Everything on his plate was bland as well with the exception of toast. Not much of a complainer but this pissed me off. Not off to a great start.",

    "text": "Let me just start by saying it's pretty tough for me to give a one star review, because I always find something I like about a place, whether it be pretty waitresses, or the fries were nice and crunchy, or the price was low enough to make it seem reasonable.  I seem to be an optimist when it comes to dining out and going to new places when I review them.  However, this place can s*** it. Horrible service was the number 1 factor, pretty crappy food in my opinion, and they sat us outside on a saturday at lunch when it was over 100 degrees already. The shade sails they have set up don't even cover up the two big tables they have out there.   The scene: Bachelor party, 10 guys, needing some comfort food after a night of drinking into the wee hours of the morning..... Earl of Sandwich just across the hall was our #1 choice, but the line was about 60-70 people long down the hall. Our first clue this place sucked was the fact there was no line, when across the hall the line was over an hour long. DUH to me, my mistake. We sat down, and it took about 15 minutes to even be noticed by a server, and the place was NOT AT ALL busy. We ordered a bunch of waters, and a couple bloody mary's. 15 minutes later, we still didn't have anything to drink. Finally we went up to the bartender and asked for our waters. Then, we all ordered our food, which included a few burgers, a half rack of ribs, a steak and egg breakfast burrito, a couple club sandwiches, and a pepperoni pizza. 20 minutes later we finally got some food out to us, they cleared the trays and took off. Guess what, they didn't have the pepperoni pizza on the tray. The runners took off without asking if we had everything, and if we needed anything else (like ketchup, hot sauce, more water, etc)  So, we all realize that our boy didn't get his pizza. 5 minutes later the server came back and we brought to her attention the pizza didn't come out. She went to check on it and we saw her punching buttons on her screen, then start walking back to us, thinking she was gonna tell us it was on the way, or that she forgot to put it in the system......but nothing, she didnt' even stop by to say sorry or that it would be out in a few minutes. She just walked right on by our table to help somebody else. Now we're really starting to get pissed!!! How rude!!! What kind of service is that????  10 minutes go by and we're pretty much all done eating our food, and still no pizza. The pizza orderer said screw this and went to the server and told her not to bring it out, cancel the order, and that he doesn't even want it anymore, and to take it off the bill.   The service was horrendous when it was even there in the room, the food was way below average (the burger had no flavor and the potato salad was not cold or tasty, and I was told the fries were soft and not cooked well), especially for the price, and the drinks were expensive, even for being on the strip at a casual restaurant (why do you think we didn't order drinks at a bachelor party???) 1 star, wish I could give it less won't be coming back",

I might as well have went with the yard at $40. :)  Anywhere you sit, it is quite loud and ambient with music.  Save your receipt and you can get two beers for $8 and a ride on the bull.  Sit outdoors and soak in the afternoon sun!  Mind you, keep in mind that service can be at certain times slow, which can be expected.",

If you're in Vegas, you wanna have fun!!! But PBR doesn't really set you up for fun as they charge you an arm and a leg for drinks that don't really have much alchy in them. I paid $17 for drinks and I wasn't even close to being buzzed -- I never came back here and told my friends to stay away from this place as well. This place is pretty average, nothing spectacular or special but nothing completely awful either. Two stars for me : /",

    "text": "A group of us went there for my sisters bachelorette party on our last night in Vegas. The bull was the last stop on our pub crawl, and we were having a great time....until we went to leave. The \"operations manager\" (at least that was the card he gave us) Dean Torres, approached my sister and accused her of defacing the table where we were sitting. Apparently while we went inside to ride the bull, some jerk had written awful things on the table where we were sitting. Not only was Dean visibly angry and shaking, but he was ridiculously aggressive and confrontational. With all 5 of us girls being in the industry, and not being A-holes, we would never had done what we were being accused of. Even if we had written on the table, Deans reaction was absolutely unacceptable and not even close to how a good manager would respond. Not only were we berated by this guy, and found to be innocent, we NEVER received an apology. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! We stood around waiting for him to \"check the tapes\" so he would apologize to my sister, the bride, whose last night was RUINED by this punk, and never received squat. They didn't even comp our meal, which was the LEAST he should have done. Dean even taunted us to \"go right ahead and write his boss David\". I've never been treated with such disregard in my life. Not only will I never return to the PBR Bar, but I (along with the other girls) will make sure everyone we talk to about Las Vegas knows to steer clear of this poorly managed, bachelorette party ruining, dump.",

We bought four drinks, sat on the edge of the bull riding ring, and when we attempted to ride we were told we needed to buy a drink or we would have to pay for the ride.  Fair enough but we each had a drink in hand and were told no, we needed proof (receipt).  We went back to the bar to ask if they could print a receipt and they did, but when we attempted to ride the bull, the woman operating it was SO RUDE and told us we would still owe her money.  What?! We called the manager over and he said, well how do we know you didn't bring the drinks into the bar from outside?  You think we brought in glass cups full of beer from outside when your staff just printed us a receipt?  It was the weirdest customer service experience and the woman operating the bull was just horribly rude and unwelcoming!! I would never go back.",

    "text": "A surprisingly nice place for lunch seeing that I just stumbled upon it on a recent trip to Las Vegas. To be honest, the only reason I darkened their door in the first place was that the nearby \"Earl of Sandwich\" line was about a quarter mile long and I was starving. My companion and I headed in and bee-lined for the large comfortable bar area where we were immediately greeted by one of the many very attractive bartenders who work here. Drinks came immediately and we received only light-hearted ribbing for ordering sodas instead of cocktails or beer. Hey, I know it's Vegas, but at 11:30am, I'm still trying to regroup from the previous night's activities that concluded just hours earlier. Anyhoo, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and (I believe) a country chicken salad served as a wrap. The food came out quickly and astounded us both in presentation, flavor and sheer portion size. I guess a restaurant with a \"Professional Bull Riding\" theme needs to serve a hearty entree and they certainly delivered. We left very full and very satisfied. In fact, when it came time for brunch the next day, we found ourselves right back at the bar at PBR. This time I ordered a breakfast omelette that featured beef brisket among a savory medley of cheese, onions, peppers and potatoes. This thing was the size of a newborn, I swear. I stuffed myself and made it through just over half of the thing. So good, though. My dining companion ordered the country chicken salad wrap AGAIN and loved it for a second day straight.  In summary, great food, excellent service and an entertaining time chatting it up with the bartenders and watching women take turns riding the nearby mechanical bull. Certainly an unexpected gem in Las Vegas!",

(When I mean cheaper, I mean their entrees here are roughly around 11-15$)  But, even given the handicap, it's still pretty poopy.  My group had a bad experience with a server but all the other times I've came, the bartenders have been pleasant.  Decent sized Shock Top for 9 dollars... I'll take it.  (Again- it's the strip, I'm compromising)  Their patio is right on Vegas blvd across from the Cosmo, so that's a redeeming quality.  In general I think Planet Hollywood has some of the weakest restaurants/beers on the Strip.  Miracle Mile is the only reason I go there.  I'd say if you're at Planet Hollywood and you want to drink beers on the patio and eat below-average bar food then give it a go.  Or if you're into the whole obnoxious loud sorta-country bull-riding ambiance.  Other than that there's cheaper food and drinks elsewhere.",

So, we waited for our server but ended up having to just go find condiments ourselves. Later when the server actually popped up to quickly ask us if everything was fine, I asked if it was part of standard procedure to get a dry burger and then have to go on a hunt for mayonnaise or ketchup.

Thefood sucks and the drinks are diluted. It's not worth the money at all. They are known for their 100ounce drinks but trust me, don't have it. Their cocktails are basically just a combination of sugar and ice. For food, we tried their bbq pizza and omg, what a nightmare. We were very hungry and the waitress recommended this pizza. It's basically just few pieces of chicken with an overload of bbq sauce.",

    "text": "Last Friday (8/23), my friend and I had taken a visit to this restaurant.  I was really excited to come to this place because I had been aware of the amazing, alcoholic, fish bowl beverages that they serve.  When we arrived we got in right away and sat a high top table near the patio.  Our server, Kole, was very nice and accommodating.  The service was very good and quick!  We ordered the \"Wild Thing\" porch pounder, which was delicious.  For food, I had ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and my friend ordered the triple turkey club with fries.  The sandwiches were really tasty, but the quality of the fries was poor.  They were hard and tasteless.  Towards the end of our visit, Kole did not ask if we wanted dessert or anything else, but rather just placed the check on our table and  told us \"there is no rush, whenever you're ready.\"  A few minutes went by and a hostess walked by our table and asked if we had eaten our food yet, which was really strange.  We told the hostess yes we ate already, then she said good and walked away. Eventually, we noticed that hostesses and servers around us started to bring tables together and were talking about a larger partying needing to be sat.  My friend and I then realized we were being rushed out of the restaurant, but weren't being directly told that.  I found this was extremely rude and so we paid our tab and went outside to the bar at the patio.  A nice bartender named Aaron...I believe, began to serve us and we didn't have further issues from this point.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place if you're visiting Vegas, as there are far better restaurants to try on the strip, especially after the service my friend and I received.  It is too bad that this experience ended the way it did, as I was excited to try it out at first.  But if you do end up coming to this place, try their porch pounder beverages and not necessarily their food items!",

    "text": "This place is very loud, but has great clarity of sound, varying between piped in country and rock music.  Large and colorful flat screens are in abundance, mostly showing professional sports action.  And there are two bucking bulls: a gilded, decorative one, and a no-nonsense mechanical bull that diners can ride once for free.  I soon learned that some of the loud noise is due to the high volume of the music, but another component is the vocal cheering of onlookers encouraging amateur bull riders.  And the two riders I saw (one man and one woman) got tossed out of the saddle eventually, but looked pretty skilled and experienced at bull riding until then.  The operator of the mechanical bull starts a rider off very slow and smooth but the bull's movements become unpredictable soon enough, and it is difficult for anyone to remain indefinitely fixed in the saddle.   Regarding the food, I enjoyed very good Chili made of a lot of beef, Kidney Beans, and cheese ladled inside a bread bowl; and a good Pulled Pork Sandwich with a little bit of Coleslaw and sweet BBQ sauce encased inside a cold, highly polished plain bun.  There were a few burnt crisp ends but the Pulled Pork was mostly tender, and extra requested BBQ sauce nicely moistened the sandwich.  The real standouts though were my choice of homemade Potato Salad as an included side, and Diane's selected French Fries.  The Potato Salad contained egg whites and celery; and Diane's Fries were long, thin, and wiggly.  The two starches were equally excellent.  Diane's Cheeseburger came out ultra-rare initially.  But, after I pointed this out to our server, a new medium-rare Cheeseburger as ordered was quickly supplied, without any fuss.  Diane said she liked the replacement.  Service was not very friendly at first, but our server seemed to warm up to us as the night wore on.  We had to ask for Iced Tea and water refills.  But, in all fairness, in the capacious dining room each server had many diners to attend to.  And even after midnight this rocking and fun place was not lacking for customers.     XXX-1.2 stars overall on this particular night.",

The food was mediocre bar food and all of our meals, from the salmon to brisket, was over cooked and dry. The jambalaya was very basic nothing special... there is far better jambalaya right down the strip.  Perhaps the worst part of the experience was at our table.  We sat at a high table with a gas fire pit in the middle. The pigs that sat there before us used the fire pit as an ash tray and left a bunch of cigarette butts in it... freakin' nasty!  I understand you can't stop people from being pigs, but this should have been cleaned up before we were seated. The lone bright spot was our server... she was attentive, engaging and cute.    I think they lure you in with the 2 for 1 drink coupons and the rest is disappointing.  There are far too many better options on the strip to settle for mediocrity.",

We ordered the brisket breakfast burrito and the tomato bisque with grilled cheese sandwich. The burrito really lacked flavor. The brisket was not seasoned well and didn't even look like brisket. The tomato bisque soup was the only thing that tasted good because the grilled cheese sandwich was just ok. The cheese was average and hadn't completely melted. I would recommend for the alcoholic drinks, but not the food.",

The service was good. Everyone was nice and answered any questions I had. There's a mixed crowd. They have television to watch games etc. the size of the drinks are pretty big which is good I believe they have two for one drinks as well.

And this was on a Monday night with the restaurant at about 40% capacity.  So, instead of waiting till closing time for them to realize our existence, we took our business elsewhere.    What splendid indifference!  PBR, you should clean house and hire customer-first types.",

However the manager was a dick the night of the Super Bowl that I highly recommend people go elsewhere unless they like being treated like shit.  After a great day/night of drinking and meeting new friends, my girl and I left with some \"to go\" food we ordered earlier that day. We spent $500 for an open bar, food and tip with $100 of that going to food. Since we couldn't physically eat that much food, we order food to go. It wasn't until we got home that we realized that some food was missing so we called the place back and spoke with the worst manager. He refused to give us his name so unfortunately we can't call him out.   Essentially this guy told us to come back to the bar to pick up the food they forgot to give us (which was a good 20 min cab ride away) or too bad. After trying to be reasonable to ask them to deliver the food we just paid for, he apparently didn't want to talk any longer and hung up on us.   Worst customer service we've ever dealt with and highly suggest going somewhere else if you don't want to feel like you got stiffed.",

They are strip facing so it's easy to get in that way. BAD: they are at PH which if you are a local is terrible to park at . Right across from the Cosmo! They have live music outside in the evening AND they have outside seating. They are also situated right next ot the PH sports book #score! So you can place bets really easily.  They have a back room that seats like 20. WHY they don't advertise this for sports watching/rental with a minimum spend I don't know. It has couches, it has flip cup, it has tv's, and wait for it ...it has SOUND! or can have sound. Went there with my friend's bachelor party and sat in this special room, it was awesome!    Their menu is amazing: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They even had a grilled PB&J which my friend actually ordered, but their roasted chicken salad sandwich *crowd pleaser* I went back to eat there just for that sandwich",

Then another Server came to us and apologized for the wait saying that he will take over and the previous sever had an emergency. Funnily enough,  5 min after the new server spoke to  us, we saw the previous sever , waiting and serving the table next to us and even around at the bar, but he was not serving us.

There's also a completely separate bar that is more of a cowboy bar than the other so as to not disappoint the sound of the name. I personally know the dj so I stayed in the dance area but more was going on there anyways. DJ Sally keeps that place hopping. The karaoke is fun for everyone. One guest did a jodeci song and the next did an Elvis song and everyone enjoyed. The stage for karaoke makes it a pro feel to it. Having to get up on an elevated stage with lights in your face gives it a more star feel to singing in front of everyone which is cool. It's a step up. Adequate space throughout. I did not spend much time in the other side except to use the restroom which is on that side. It was even more space and more of the traditional type of cowboy bar that I'm used to seeing in SoCal.",

We just wanted a quick bite close to our hotel as we stopped mid getting ready to eat and didn't want to go far and take too much time out of our getting ready/pre game time. My friend and I both ordered half a rack of ribs with a side of fries and coleslaw.   The reason why I've given this review 4/5 is because the food was delicious and it came out to us very quickly, the ribs were so meaty and tender. However, the general service was not very good. Our waitress was fairly grumpy, we straight away asked for ketchup and an extra plate to put the rib bones on. She brought them over about 3 mouthfuls before we finished our food. By that point I had already asked someone else. She never came over to ask if everything was ok.   When it came to getting the cheque, I had to ask her twice because after asking her once she said yes sure and disappeared for 20 minutes! I would definitely return because the atmosphere was good, food was delicious and reasonably priced, but I won't expect outstanding service and I wouldn't return if I know I'm in a rush or have somewhere to be. If the service had been good, I would have given 5/5. The poor service definitely reflected in the tip I gave her!",

I don't know exactly how many ounces is in each one of those but I can tell you it's a lot. Throw in a couple of extra shots in each and it'll mess even some heavy weights.   We went in and tried a bunch of different foods. The food was pretty good, although we were all pretty hammered so there's a high probability it's a lot worse than how I remember it.

Take a shot, ride the bull, and see some of the much better eating establishments in las vegas!",

It was a little loud in there.  When you leave the restaurant don't forget to take a picture with the bull and check its balls out lol.",

My beef is with the hostess - we were seated right away (we had a reservation), but as soon as we were seated, we noticed the table was uneven.  Not the legs are off/stuff napkins under one side kind of uneven, but the top of the table coming off the supporting column.   We mentioned this to our server (Crissy), who immediately volunteered to fix, then after realizing the issue, went to get us a new table.  The hostess came over, angry, and said there were no other tables right now - because this was our fault?  There was a high-top, which we took, but it was completely the wrong attitude.  And no one else ever came and apologized, checked on us, etc. - we also moved ourselves.    Kudos for convenience, food is fine, but save anger towards the customers until they do something to annoy you.",

    "text": "So it's my first night in Vegas and I had a hankering for a burger. The boyfriend and I stopped here on a Thursday night and it really wasn't crowded at all. The first thing I noticed was the inconsistency of the style of the bar with the design, music, posters, etc. For one thing it's trying to play that cozy country bar attitude, but it has faux leather booth seats as if you're sitting at an Applebee's and the music really leaves a lot to be desired. (2000's pop music, totally not the vibe they were going for) The wait staff was nice and friendly but also didn't go out of her way to make sure our drinks were refilled on time and we had to wait.  Now I can totally overlook the feel and music, and uncomfortable seating IF the food is good. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here. For the appetizer, we ordered the chili cheese taters. The taters were fresh and hot but totally buried under way too much cheese and even more chili. I usually like chili, but this wasn't a homey comfort food chili, it was more like 90% out of a can chili.  For dinner, I got a BBQ burger which is usually a go-to for me because I love BBQ sauce. The burger was falling apart, and not in a good way. And it definitely wasn't cooked medium, it was well done. Also a big no-no for me is if food doesn't have any flavor. There was really no taste except the toppings and the ground beef. If I took ground beef with no seasoning and cooked it well done at home, it most likely would've tasted better than what I got. So it looks like I won't be coming back here.  If you want a good burger, try Burger Brasserie! That place was surprisingly awesome!! After coming here, I was pretty nervous to try burgers anywhere in Vegas, but wasn't disappointed.",

Thursday, April 14, 2017 They ate at their first American restaurant in Las Vegas which was PBR because they had a meal with a show offer. The evening started off well with the fun mechanical bull riding but I'm sad to say that for their first family dinner and a show they received awful service from then on. They were told they could not order their food until 5 pm even though the show started at 7pm. The food came out late, it tasted ok and they ended up having to miss their desserts because they had to leave for the show. My sister in law (who is visiting the U.S) realized she had left her phone at the restaurant and was panicked and relieved to see that it was turned in at the hostess front area. As we got the phone, the waitress came us up at the front and told us we had an extra $6.00 charge after we paid our bill and gave her a proper tip even though the service as not good! Nasty surprise for us seeing as how she wasn't considered about the situation, only that we needed to pay 6.00 dollars. We gave her the cash and left. Needless to say we wouldn't return or suggest anything other than a try at the mechanical bull riding there.  Gave the two stars for the bull and the polite lady who was there running it.",

I spent the last three days there (not counting today, because reality made me leave... darn!) and met some really amazing people (both people that work there and patrons).  It's a huge place, and yes... they have a mechanical bull you can ride (no, I don't ride the bull).  Basically it's three bars and a patio.  For me, the smaller back bar was comfortable.  I tried the big front bar and, while it was still fun, I just kinda felt more comfortable back in the back.  Even when it was busy, it was home.  I won't name names (mainly because I don't think I can find all my card receipts), but everybody that worked in the back while I was there... thank you for making my latest Vegas trip something to remember.  Cheers, and Jameson on the rocks for everyone!  :)  *** Update:  I forgot.  The metal bar stools in the back bar... they seriously suck.  Please switch them out with something with some cushion?

    "text": "MISSED THE MARK.  We went to this location out of convenience and should of ventured out.  I cannot complain about the ambiance.  Who wouldn't like 1000 flatscreen TV's and a mechanical bull.  These created a fun an lively atmosphere, but unfortunately it ends there.  As a bonus, you get a free drink when you check in, which comes in handy when a Margarita costs $12.  I ordered a cup of chilli to start and was asked if I'd like it before my meal, to which I said yes.  My chilli arrived and was great.  It is served with a piece of corn bread.  Very hearty, this can almost be a meal all by itself.  The problem started when my meal arrived one minute after I got my chilli.  I initially ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with the Doritos Mac n Cheese.  As soon as I sampled a rib, I realized why it came out so fast.  The meat was clearly pre-cooked and wasn't sufficiently reheated.  My ribs were actually cold.  We also ordered the Chicken Mac n Cheese and a BLT.  The Chicken Mac n Cheese did not have any desirable taste.  After a lot of salt, pepper and hot sause, a decision was made to give up trying to improve on this disaster.  The BLT comes on a very large piece of bread, but lacks the BLT to compliment the size of the bread.  Ultimately we decided to send back the ribs and mac n cheese and opted for burgers.  The burgers were just OK.  They clearly don't know how to cook them to the appropriate temperatures requested.  Finally our waiter forgot to discount our coupon as well.  While dining a woman came over to take our picture, which we gladly posed for.  While we were trying to eat a second woman, who was extremely rude came over to try to sell us the picture.  She did not like the fact that I said no thank you to her.  At least she could have waited until we were almost done eating before interrupting us.  Overall, if you are gonna drink and ride the bull, you should be OK.  Don't go out of your way for a dining experience unless you want to be disappointed.",

I would say come here to watch sports, have some drinks, and eat some bar food.   When I've come here, I've ordered really strange combinations - mainly because I've felt like death from lack of sleep, loss of money, and nights of free booze.   That being said, the best thing I've ordered there is the chicken noodle soup. Strange, I know, but it's really tasty and comes with grilled cornbread. The coffee is also good.   I ordered the taco pizza this trip - soggy and lacked flavor. Don't get it. I also got a pb&j during a weird breakfast. The Texas toast isn't toasted and is giant so it doesn't allow for the gooey deliciousness that is a pb&j, plus they use raspberry jelly. It should be grape at any respectable establishment. Slightly kidding.   The wings are pretty good. You can get some of those and not be disappointed. Oh, and the Bloody Mary is also enjoyable.   Shots here are huge if you're looking for drinks. Just huge. Dangerously so. Shooters appear tiny next to a shot, but they're the right size.   The staff is friendly and attentive. It's a fun environment. They've got beer pong and bull riding. You'll need to eat when you're partying and this place is just as good as any other bar you could stumble into.",

The waiter took quite a while to come over to our table to take our orders and ask if we wanted any drinks. Once we placed our orders, we never saw him again for about 15-20 minutes. He brought the food out and walked away quickly. None of us had any utensils and we all wanted refills on our water/drink orders.   We had to hunt down someone else to go get us some utensils and asked if the waiter could come back to refill the drinks. It took him FOR-EV-ERRRR.   We never saw him again after that for a good 20 minutes or so. Once he came back to clear the table we asked for the check and he said he would bring it right over. Nope. Another 15-20 minutes pass and my boyfriend had gotten so fed up with waiting he went over to the hostess stand to tell them how long we had been waiting and that we wanted the check so we could pay and leave. Someone went to get the waiter and he finally brought over the check.   I like this place because the food is good, prices are good, the atmosphere is fun, and it's a good location, but when service is this bad it really makes us unlikely to go back again.",

The food is over-priced and not that great.  I mean that's Vegas for you, but typically you can get good over-priced food.  This place is definitely more for bachelor parties and people out on the town wasted.  They specialize in beverage bowls that are super expensive and very big.  The food is just underwhelming and made me feel like I could have gotten it at any chili's, Appleby's or other chain restaurant for 25% less $. The only entertaining part is watch idiots ride the mechanical bull, but that's really not that fun unless you are drunk and the people riding are drunk too, plus then the food would taste better.  This was a bad start to our dining experiences, luckily it got better.",

We sat outside even though it was hotter outside they have misting machines all around to keep it cool. The food came out pretty quick and it was delicious, we ordered a mix of breakfast and regular food and it was all good. We liked the food so much we came back the next day with a larger group and sat outside again. It was busier and we got a different server this time. The food took a long time to come out, and I got an egg sandwich which must have been cooked first because it was cold and everyone else's was good. I didn't complain about it because I was too hungry, another person also complained the chicken was very bland. Other than that the food was good. The Doritos crusted Mac and cheese was amazing! The tator tots were also delicious.",

The table next to us (same size party-5) ordered about 10 minutes after us but got their food first and FINISHED before we even got our food. I asked for status and was told \"it's coming\". Umm...When!? Maybe about another 10 minutes we got our food.  We had to ask for water refills. Our food was gross! The Mac and cheese Doritos sides is tasteless. Watery noodles with crushed Doritos on top. Doesn't even taste like Mac and cheese.  My hubby's eggs were over cooked and his toast was burnt.  Nasty! We didn't even eat it.  Mind you. The place wasn't even busy. Horrible! We will NEVER come back!",

After about two weeks the communication became horrible. It would take me 3 or 4 emails for Regina to reply to me. When I would finally call she'd have no idea what I was talking about and it was a huge mess. When I finally got her to send over the CC authorization form she told me the prices went up. It took another two weeks for her to get back to me saying she'd honor the pricing I was sent. All the way up to the day before the event I was trying (sending multiple of the same email even from different emails) to contact her.   The actual bar wasn't bad. Our day of contact/manager was Megan and she wasn't overly friendly nor was she rude. The only times I saw her was when we first went in and when she brought over the remainder of the balance. We had it from 7:30 to 9:30 and until 9 it wasn't very lively, everyone was sitting around and all of a sudden the lights went down and they started playing Rap/Hip Hop and it became PACKED. They opened the door from the main entry area and when we went to the bathroom the guy wasn't going to let us back in. He said our party was over and we needed to go get a stamp. He was rather rude about it. We had two bartenders; one was amazing! She never let my cup go empty and her attitude was great.",

In fact, it is the same price to order a beer as a soda apparently because the first time I ordered soco and pepsi and a beer and it was $14.00 (well drink in a small plastic cup, beer in a large one.)  Second time, I had soco and pepsi and just a pepsi and the price was $14.00.  2) The food is mediocre (read \"Meh\") at best.  The pizzas were soggy with apparently freeze dried ingredients.  3) If you want to play beer pong, they have a few tables here however they are very crowded so I am sure it turns into a fraternity atmosphere as more people fill in.  4) They did have a ton of sports tv's which I liked. And a few booths where you could sit by the beer pong tables. (There is dinner seating a little farther back but we did not venture over there.)  Overall a very disappointing experience.",

I checked-in here with Yelp so I got the buy one drink get one free deal, that was cool; but the drink I ordered had pineapple juice in it, and I believe it was bad or the cup wasn't clean I don't know which but I swear the drink tasted like ice cold vomit. When we took the drink back to the bartender all she said was oh no the pineapple juice is good, smh it was soooo disgusting.  Where in the hell was John Taffer when I needed him!?!?! I can't believe I even tried to force myself to drink that sh!t. She took our drinks and threw  them out and said if we wanted new drinks we had to pay again,yeah right. Fxck these drinks. The first drink was just ok, and the second round tasted like vomit, umm pass. Probably would have tasted better if I was already drunk, but vomit flavored is very hard to ignore. There were some guys there playing beer pong, and they had the ball flying all over the damn place. A few times the ball was on the floor in the corner where the \"VIP\" couch and main window/wall is, if you look on the ground and see the filth build-up smh, I was thinking these MF'ers are gonna have Hepatitis A by the end of the night. Beer or alcohol doesn't kill everything, but good luck guys! What I was really surprised about was the music though. With the name of it being PBR Rockbar I expected to hear mostly Country or Rock, but they had a mix of Hip-Hop playing, old Hip-Hop but still. Anyway this wasn't a great experience for me and I don't feel like this is my type of bar anyway, so more than likely I would personally not come back here to spend money.",

Don't come here if you are looking forward to a super appetizing meal. It is essentially just bar food that is served. I ate the Chili Cheese Taters and the PBR Burger. The food is heavy and there is nothing special about it. Most of our stomachs felt unsettled after eating here.

The drinks seemed a little pricey at $12 dollars a pop, but the were quite tasty with appropriate alcohol content. I tried the Chicken Avacado Burger and it was good - possibly a little dry. The fries were just ok. Two burgers, two drinks and an average tip totalled almost $70. Seemed a little high, but I guess you're paying for the location. I really enjoyed the outdoor heat lamps and the view inside of guests trying to ride the mechanical bull.",

    "text": "Went here on a late Friday evening looking for grub and drinks since we were staying at PH. We came across this place and checked it out. Our medium sized group sat at a nice large table near the main bar. TVs available all around. Sports on TV we're nearly over and there wasn't too busy of a crowd.   We ordered drinks, a few appetizers and an entree. I got the hot wings which had a nice kick to them. Nothing much to complain on the food, it was satisfying. Drinks were good, shots were nearly doubles. If you're feeling whimsical, check out their specialty drinks. My cousin tried the Hat Bender and it tasted like a watermelon Jolly Rancher. :)  This place was pretty chill when we went. I'm sure if there were games playing this would be bumpin'. There's also a mechanical bull controlled by an employee.   Overall a cool experience. Service was friendly and attentive. I wouldn't mind coming back again. Atmosphere was of a sports bar/western feel.",

Love love love the chicken & waffles, and since I get that every time I can't review any other food. My husband has had the tri tip sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich, and the steak...all were great according to him! We have, however, had dessert there, and both the cookie pizookie and the waffle sundae are amazing...the waffle sundae wins though! Last night they had a red sangria that was super yummy! Overall a great rating for me! Prob not a place for you to get fancy and posh Vegas food, but we love it!!!",

It's a chain bar that has a bunch of locations all over the country so, it's not super special.  If you like country, beer pong, mechanical bulls, bartenders with spikey mohawks (dudes) and cowboy boots (chicks)... and don't care too much for food... Then this place is for you.  Yee haw!",

If you have a Groupon, they REQUIRE you make a reservation.  This isn't exactly a reservation type place, but you must do it.  When you call, they will ask you if you want \"outside or inside\".  The correct answer to that question is going to be \"inside\" --  unless it's December.  This place gets some direct sunlight and it is smoking hot on that patio - sit inside with the AC.   I had an order of potato skins (wasn't that hungry...  we ate all the way to Vegas!) and she had a pizza.  My potato skins were OK... very standard.  Could have been frozen.  But not objectionable.  Her pizza was as big as a coffee table and also just OK.  The crust was a little over-done, but again it was certainly edible.    If you're lucky, free entertainment will present itself with brave (or drunk) people riding the mechanical bull.  The service was surprisingly friendly and efficient.  Better than expected.  If you get a Groupon for this place, it's a pretty decent deal for grabbing a snack and a few drinks.  And maybe a show too.",

She was so friendly and conversed with the table (a duh moment right? But you don't always get that).   We ordered a Bloody Mary- it was ok. It was more on the spicy level which is what I look for. But a basic Bloody Mary sometimes is all you need. We also got a house salad (best house salad I've had) a Caesar (eh it was ok) &a the wings. The wings were almost breaded and really fatty inside. The ranch was what made it worse to be honest. I'm almost positive it's Hienz ranch that comes prepackaged. My cousin ordered fish & chips that she took one bite of and left. My beer came out with an inch of head- so I missed out on about two inches of what should have been more beer. I used the yelp offer for buy on get one so maybe that's why.   Anyways, the 4 stars are for the server, staff,  & ambiance. The food is not stellar and could use a lot of fixes.",

I had to walk to the middle of planet hollywood to use the restroom. It was overall an awful experience. I would not recommend it.",

    "text": "Well I went here twice during the week for lunch but I admit it was mostly because of the patio.  Great location, very central on the strip and easy to meet friends at.  The first time I felt screwed by the waitress as she kept bringing buckets of beer, and I don't think anyone was asking for it.  She was also assuming the previous order was the same s the next order which wasn't the case because some of the guys were leaving. long story short, we ended up leaving behind four full beers that we paid for, but didn't order.  The second time I went was great.  I can't complain. And it was very relaxing.  The food is typical bar food, no big deal, but it is such a nice way to chill when you've been walking around all morning.",

I was surprised with a barbeque like chip that was used but it still tasted pretty great.  The waitress was cool, but I wasn't about to take crap from anyone for having a glass of reisling. It's a good thing she was nice and very helpful, otherwise she would've dealt with my wrath.  The price of the food was WAY overpriced for what we were getting. I could've easily gone to a Red Robin and got the same stuff for like 10 bucks cheaper. If you had any other option that was cheaper, I'd go with another option. The alcohol was expensive as well.  All in all, this place seems average with what other restaurants have. It's not a place you have to stop by and eat at unless you're a sport nut.",

In spite of there being well over 10 empty tables we were told we needed to wait in line. (there was no line!) Then we were told there would be an additional minimum charge of $50 more or we could have a seat back at the bar.  We went back to the bar - the manager came over to talk to us. We complained about the way we were treated. Obviously the manager was embarrassed in front of the other customers and we were asked to leave.  Absolutely, the worst!",

Last night though, my husband and I waited in line and when we arrived at the front, they explained that girls were free and my husband would have to pay 10 bucks, but would receive two free drinks. So we took our little coupons and went to the bar, where the ratchet ass bartender was too busy TWERKING and shot gunning beers to even notice us.So we were told to use our coupons at the bar in the front since the TWERKING girl was too busy to pay attention to her customers. So we went to the bar in the front, only to be turned down, and told we would have to go back inside. When we went back inside I was greeted with a dirty look and asked \" What do you want!?\" I asked her to repeat herself because I couldn't believe how unbelievably rude she was. Sure enough, she repeated herself in the same tone, with her hand on her hip. So I walked out. Plus, why is it named \"Rock Bar\" if they only play techno and music people twerk to? Super lame.",

    "text": "My husband had read about this restaurant in his Las Vegas newsletter prior to our trip.  He also looked at the menu on their website which indicated they might have some pretty awesome food . We are self-proclaimed foodies and enjoy trying different restaurants ,splurging and not being calorie conscious when we vacation. We arrived on Sunday morning January 15th and the restaurant was busy  We were told there were only high tables available which we reluctantly agreed to.  Then the hostess attempted to seat us at a 2 person table with a beam right beside us which blocked most of views.  She reluctantly sat us at a 4 person table where we did have great views of all TV's which my husband enjoyed.  Although we noticed there were two regular tables after being seated that were empty, maybe you can reserve those??? Our server came to the table fairly quickly but needless to say she was not very personable.  I realize people have bad days but come on put on a smile & act like you enjoy working there, it really will effect your tip!  I was shocked  when within 2 minutes after we placed our order the table of young men who were sat right before us started receiving their food.  Our food arrived within no less than 10 minutes....to me that is a sign that food is not cooked fresh to order and when I am paying $40 for lunch I expect fresh food.  My husband ordered hot wings with blue cheese dressing. Our server forgot the blue cheese dressing so we had to flag down another server to bring him some.  The wing meat was dry & overcooked which again leads me to believe they were pre-cooked & just reheated.  (Wonder if they have a trillion microwaves running in the kitchen)  He ordered cheesy fries which were hot on top because of the melted cheese but underneath the fries were cold.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a spicy remoulade sauce which got lost in all the lettuce.  The meat was lukewarm which again leads me to believe we are just reheating in the kitchen and not doing a very good job of that.  I don't believe in sending my food back to any kitchen after watching TV shows where chefs get upset when customers send back food and so they do something atrocious to the food before sending it back out to the unsuspecting customer.  I only gave this restaurant one star because I could not give it zero.  We had planned to take a large party of people to this restaurant when we go back to celebrate our anniversary in March but after our experience there I think not!  This was the most expensive meal we ate the entire weekend and the worst meal....if you want food don't go to this restaurant.  If you want to drink and watch sports this place is for you!",

We showed up around 7:15...plenty of time for a quick bite before a 9pm show IMHO.  We were seated quickly and given a set menu for <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvegas.com&s=8f6495a73525d93a5f38a11fe5008c81a963aeba73b747cd1fd8484ec13886ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegas.com</a>.  It did not have the full selection of their menu, but was diverse enough that I was ok with it.   That's however where the good ends.  Service was SLOW SLOW SLOW.  Waiter was nice and meant well, but I think he was overwhelmed with tables.   We both ordered the field greens & goat cheese salad....greens tasted like insecticide and barely had any dressing on them.  Took 20 min to get salads and another 20 min for Entrees.  I ordered the Shrimp & Grits....grits were odviously cheese whiz out of a jar mixed up with instant box grits.  Shrimp were grilled OK with a generous dusting of cajun seasoning.  My wife ordered the Surf & Turf...came completely cold.  I mean steak, shrimp, potato cakes...everything cold.  Wife sent it back, completely disappointed because service was so slow that there would be no time for them to remake it and make the show (show offered NO late seating).  Called the MGR over and she was apologetic, but just offered to \"take care of us after the show\".  Now, if the experience was so bad then why in hell would I want to return?    I sent this to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvegas.com&s=8f6495a73525d93a5f38a11fe5008c81a963aeba73b747cd1fd8484ec13886ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegas.com</a> as well because they need to know about the quality of the restaurants they choose to partner with!",

    "text": "I've been to the bar but the other evening was my first time trying the food. We arrived during happy hour so we opted for domestic draft beer with our dinner. I was there with a client visiting from Chicago. They liked the fact that PBR serves \"real food.\"  One of them did chicken wings and the other opted for deviled eggs, fruit salad and a \"PBR & J.\" I had the BBQ shrimp skewers, sauce on the side, extra veggies with no rice. Loved it! I'm not  fan of cherry tomatoes and they happily replaced them with celery, upon my request, with no drama whatsoever. As for dessert, I don't do a lot of dessert, but I had to taste my dining companion's warm cookie with ice cream. Wow!  Fun atmosphere, too, and clever promotions - like Twitter Thursday. And I want to go back for breakfast. The breakfast menu looks good, too. Not only that - but the outdoor patio fronts the LV strip.  I'd dine or drink out there, weather permitting.  And if you go here, wear pants so you can  try riding the bull! Big fun and you won't be as self conscious as I was since I had a dress on!",

    "text": "On Wednesday my boyfriend and I were walking around in the PH Miracle Mile shops and were handed a card for college night here-open bar until 1 am with college ID, $5 for girls/$10 for guys. We figured it would be a good place to pre game and then we would figure out somewhere to go after, maybe Gallery upstairs. We were surprised to find that the inside of the bar was much more club-y than bar-y. Started with classic rock which was kind of fun and expected considering the vibe of the place, but by 11 it had switched to loud top-40 once the college crowd started to fill up the place. The floor was packed with drunk college students dancing like crazy... we left around 1 when the thought of another vodka-red bull seemed like a really bad idea! I can't think of anywhere cheaper in Vegas to drink/party/pregame if you have guys in tow, although I did feel bad for the poor fools who bothered to pay for bottle service here, honestly even for non-college students it was $20 for guys for cover + open bar until 1... That said, if you're a group of girls you can probably find better open bar options early in the night in Vegas.",

The waiter was young and inexperienced (and since we were a party of six gratuity was already added so he must have thought he didn't need to try hard).  It wasn't until after I got home and checked my bank statement did I see that he had helped himself to $103.00 tip.  My receipt shows a bill for $33.00.  After calling the manager several times with no response, I will be filing a fraudulent claim with my bank.  Just thought I would let fellow diners know that there are so many better options on the strip and customer service here is severely flawed.",

We took two trips into here within a few hours of each other with two somewhat different experiences.  The first was at 3 for the happy hour drink specials which was as advertised except the fact that we had a VERY un-attentive  waiter which resulted in delayed drinks each time we got his attention.  The second time we asked to be seated outdoors which was half full yet appeared to have adequate service staff.  WRONG!  We were there for 17 minutes with only a menu and a glass of water which was delivered promptly by the hostess when seated.  When we left as we were walking down back onto the strip the hostess stated \"you weren't helped yet?\" which sounds like is fairly typical and my answer was no and she apologized.  The appetizer of catfish nuggets were pretty good for bar food as was the artichoke dip that was great.  Food however takes people to request it from and to deliver so get your stuff together and this would be a good bar right on the strip.",

    "text": "Originally we walked around the strip a little bit looking for a nice outdoor restaurant where we could watch some games outdoor and get some moderately priced food and drinks.  We checked to the menu at PBR and it seemed to have a few interesting items that seemed right up our alley for this night.  We were asked inside if we could sit outside and so they told us that would be fine and we walked to the outside area overlooking the strip.  We found another hostess outside so we asked for a table for two.  She didn't have any at the time, but found us a nice spot at the railing overlooking the strip.  The area itself was clean, high chairs which I prefer but a very small space to put buckets of beers or food.  We checked out the menu and waited for our waiter Paul.  He didn't come over until after we had to wave down another employee 10 minutes later.  At this point we were a little frustrated but decided to stay and make the best of it.  The bucket of beer prices for five 16 oz domestic beers wasn't bad for the strip, $18.00.  We ordered our drinks and a small appetizer.  Well, it took another seven to eight minutes to get the drinks and another fifteen minutes to get our appetizer.  When we received the appetizer it was brought out by one of the cooks, who was very grumpy and tapped me on the shoulder to give it to me.  When I turned to take it from him he threw it in front of me with a disgruntled attitude.  At this point we started eating the appetizer, when during the middle of eating it our waiter Paul came up and took our menus without asking if we wanted to place any more orders (which we still did).  We ate about half the appetizer which was a salty mess.  The appetizer was the tater invader which was a mix of tator tots, fries, chilli and chives.  After the appetizer we decided to leave and took four of our five beers with us.  We spoke to the manager at the end of the meal and he seemed as if he was not surprised by who gave us the bad service.  The manager did not try to make it up to us in any way.  This will be the last time we will try PBR, it was just a rancid mess.",

Our first two servers were wonderful, friendly, and helpful. Our third server was a nightmare.  Most of us had the $10 open bar which was a good deal for the ones who were drinking. We shared an order of sweet potato tots that were really awesome and the chocolate chip cookie skillet which was great too. My friend chicken was dry and bland but I didn't mind so much.   By the time we were ready to go it took about 15-20 minutes to flag down our server for the bills. It wasn't particularly busy either. When we got the bills a few things had been charged twice. Took another 5-10 minutes to flag down our server to fix this. She stomped away. Got the bill back again and divided it from there. We even wrote out the last four digits of each credit card number and the amount to charge to make it easier.   When we got back our bills I find that mine has been charged a bit more than I expected. When adding it all up later in the evening (wish I had done it right there) I find it was charged an extra $15. Wouldn't be such an issue if that wasn't about 50% more than what I should have been charged. Not sure if there was an auto gratuity added onto just MY bill but if that was the case I should have been informed. Granted I probably should have figured this out before we left but by then we had waited over 30 minutes to pay and leave. We mostly just wanted to get out of there and I seriously doubted the server's competence in fixing the bill (even after a third try).   I also come home to find an e-mail stating that they cancelled my reservation for no reason even though I showed up. Funny, I could swear the hostess had checked me in but apparently they cancelled me. How odd.  My first experience here was fabulous but this one has left such an awful taste in my mouth that I doubt I will return.",

    "text": "01.07.12 Welcome to the PBR Rock Bar & Grill! Contrary to popular belief, PBR does not stand for what most would assume. It actually stands for Professional Bull Riding. However, for you Whiskey Tango brown-baggers, they DO have Pabst Blue Ribbon on tap. Although this place was packed with the Saturday lunch NFL playoff crowd, our wait was less than the 20 minutes the hostess suggested it would be. There is absolutely no shortage of flat-screens. No matter where I faced, I was watching THE game. $7 pint imports & $12 pulled-pork sandwich on what seems to be a Big Mac sesame seed hamburger bun is what I received for lunch. The pulled pork was tasty with their signature root beer BBQ sauce & topped off with a tangy slaw. However, I like pulled pork a little more \"pulled\" as I was extracting big chunks with every other bite & that weak bun was just not holding up the task at hand. But now I'm just nitpicking. It was still a pretty good sandwich. If you're that girl who loves being the center of attention, there's a bull-ridin' machine that has your name on it...but wait! All you guys can get on that bull as well...and unless you're an actual cowboy, your friends will get a gut-busting laugh as you hang on for dear life. Our server, Christina, (as busy as she was) was really on top of things & very accommodating, never leaving us wanting or parched. Even my wife liked her...and that's sayin' a lot! With the variety of eateries here at the Miracle Mile, I think our taste buds made the right choice.  01.08.12 We stopped in for Steelers/Bronco game & bellied up to the bar. I have only great things to say about our bartender, Courtney. She really rocked the time we spent here.  Solid 3 stars for the food.  I'm adding an additional star because Christina & Courtney really went above and beyond to make our experience at PBR enjoyable.  May your eats always be tasty & your drinking glass never go empty. I'm out. Peace!",

If you need to be able to watch TV while eating this is the place for you. They have a gazillion televisions everywhere.  We had the Smoked Chicken Gumbo and the Bloomin' Onion Burger. The gumbo was definitely very tasty. The burger deep-fried inside the breaded onion ring was pretty good too.  Overall not a bad place to eat a meal. Don't know how it is when it's real busy though.",

    "text": "Absolutely atrocious service.   My fiance and I went it to watch two football games (his Niners and my Broncos) and we found a comfortable seat at a big table, which multiple groups where sharing. We were so excited to watch our games, have some food, and drink some beers.   After about five minutes, a server came up to us and took our drink orders, as well as an appetizer to share.   About five minutes after that (still no drinks), a hostess came up and said that we needed to move, because this table was reserved. Huh? There were no signs, the waitress already took our order, and we had been sitting there for 10 minutes! We went back and forth with her for a bit, and she was completely rude about it.   But here's the kicker...she then said she would put us on the waiting list and we could be seated in 20 - 30 minutes. You've got to be kidding me. We had already ordered our friggen food!  We then talked to another hostess, who would barely look us in the face. She said she could take us to the back corner of the bar (barely any TVs), otherwise it would be 20 - 30 minutes. And all the while she was rolling her eyes at us and interrupting us, not considering our side of the story. Pretty sure that \"reserved\" table was just going to a group of her friends who wanted it last minute.   Needless to say we left, but I was blown away. Obviously, this restaurant is doing well if they support turning away paying customers like this. More power to them.",

I didn't take the time to read the bottom of the menu -- which was where the burgers and dogs were. Otherwise, I would definitely have gone for a dog. As it was, my salad was heavier than if I had a quarter-pound burger. I had a couple of Margaritas -- one was free courtesy of a Yelp check-in coupon on my iPhone. Pub grub. Drinks.

I called nearly 20 restaurants in town and no one would accommodate without doing a group pricing ($40 per person on select menu) I called PBR and dealt with Scott. He said he would help me out and started working on my res. I ended up making 2 separate reservations to work around some of our team who would be working the tournament till later in the evening but not hold up tables. Scott was easy to work with and straight to the point! He ended up giving us an awesome section off to the side of the patio that gave us more then enough room! they called the afternoon of to verify our res and also see if the live music they had that night outside would be to much for us and if we wanted to be placed inside. I was very pleased with their concern and attentiveness. We had an amazing night!! Our server was a doll, our food came out quick and was delicious, the live music was great, and the regular music was good too. We will definitely return and if Scott and PBR will have us we can make this our annual spot for our Vegas Tournament! Oh and scott was also nice enough to comp two deserts for our birthday twins that came! Thanks Scott and PBR we had an amazing evening  Many Thanks Silva Army",

It was everything I had hoped for, and cheap as well!",

    "text": "AhhhHhHHhHHHHhyyaaayyyyaaiiiii.  I don't know how to review this place. I came here over the weekend, on Friday, and we came at like.... 12:30pm- maybe closer to 1pm.  We (really meaning I) were super hungover and ready to grub on some excellent food. Going against my better judgment, and my trusty yelp, we decided to go here instead of LaSalsas, mostly because we didn't wanna walk anymore.  We sat down outside; it was pretty cool actually. They have benches for larger groups and you are allowed to smoke on the patio. There is a huge bar in the middle of the patio with plenty of chairs around it. There were a bunch of TVs outside as well as inside, so I could see how this place would be a fun bar/restaurant  to go to when there is a big game or fight on.   The last time I came here, however, the service was shitty. They sat us down and we waited, and waited, and waited... and waited some more, and no one ever came to check on us. We finally went up to the front and had to beg the hostess to get us a waiter. She said she would work on it, but a waiter never came! So we left.  So, this is why I say, against my better judgment I went here again on Friday. The service was BETTER, but not great. However, I will give our waitress the benefit of the doubt, and a cut her a little slack, because we did notice she was the only waitress working the patio that day.  That being said, the food... was... OK. It wasn't good. It wasn't bad. It was just OK. I got the breakfast burrito. It's drenched in a green-tasteless-trying-to-be-something-its-not sauce. It almost looked like enchilada sauce but it just wasn't. They have the option of adding meat, so maybe I should've done that, but I didn't and I was stuck with a pretty boring burrito.  I think that if I came back to this place, it'd be at night time, or for a game. But otherwise, I just can't do it captain.",

    "text": "I cannot even begin to tell you how thankful I am that this location in the Miracle Mile shops is now the PBR. The previous restaurant in this space had a serious issue with quality of service. The servers at the now defunct 'Hawaiian Tropic' were unattentive, ditzy, and downright stupid. Absolutely no concept of customer service, even though their food was pretty impressive. This low quality of service was the same up the food chain with idiotic, condescending, douchebag managerial staff. The bus boy ended up getting us our drinks for goodness sake.  But enough of my rant on the Hawaiian Fail-Tropic. That ship has sailed, giving rise to the wonderful PBR Rock Bar & Grill. Food seems expensive right off the bat, but this is a misleading thing--the portions are ENORMOUS, and delicious!  She had a chili dog and fries and I had the pulled pork sandwich and chips. I could not finish the pulled pork sandwich. And it was AMAZING.  Our server was also pretty cool and attentive, and the atmosphere was more welcoming and brighter than the previously dark-as-a-mofo HT.   Thank goodness for the Professional Bull Riders, Inc. :)",

Another employee noticed we had been sitting there awhile with no food or drinks ( we ordered water). Someone else brung the food to the table. After we finished our food which was delicious the waitress finally came back over. We asked for our tickets and she got the dirty plates off the table. I would understand if the restaurant was packed but no one was in there that early. The customer service sucked. The food on the other hand was good. I order the 3 eggs, sausage, pancakes, and fruit cup. My husband had the 3 eggs, bacon, toast, and gator tots. We probably spent about $20 and they give you a lot of food.",

But it's a cool place to watch football if you don't mind the country scene. Plenty of TVs. They have drink specials from 3-6 and you can get a Bud Light bottle for $3, which is pretty good for Vegas. There's also a mechanical bull for those into that sort of thing.  They also have a daiquiri stand you can buy from while walking through the mall. They serve daiquiris from 16oz all the way up to 100oz and you can even get an 80oz guitar shaped daiquiri if you feel like being one of those guys. They're not very strong, but if you keep the cup you get a discount when you go back which makes it an ideal way to keep your buzz going while you walk around.",

It's not gonna blow you away with the quality of the drinks, the selection, or the prices, but overall it's a nice spot if you're looking for somewhere to drink.  They have a solid Happy Hour and they have  an outside area to strip people watch if the weather is right.  It has a similar vibe to any of the other chain bars, but the ideal location on this side of the strip knocks it up a peg.  There are definitely better places to go if you're looking for a quality drink or an upscale clientele.  But if you just want a college environment similar to a Tilted Kilt or the like, then PBR is a great substitute.",

Its located in the Planet Hollywood hotel which was where we were staying so it made it even easier for us especially because its open late.  We sat on the patio on an very HOT Vegan night but thank god for the mist they have it kept us cool.  We were starving.  We ordered our food and the first turn off was that the food took almost an hour to be served.  I ordered the brisket and chicken dish.  The chicken was super dry and looked like it was tasty but the looks sure fooled me it was tasteless.  The brisket was ok but I don't like the bold bbq sauce that they used on it.  In the end by the time we ordered, received our food and ate it was just over 2 hours.  Thank god we were not in a rush.  Next time in Vegas which im sure will be soon I probably will not visit again as there are so many other choices with better results.",

We ordered Rib Eye's but the waiter recommended getting a special that was not on the menu yet which included three pieces of 3 oz steaks. To be honest the steaks tasted funny and wasn't cooked the way I asked it to be cooked. Although the waiter did offer to get it re done, it had already taken 30 minutes to get the food and didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. The artichoke dip was good, I probably will not be back to this restaurant, maybe there was a reason why their was no wait time at this restaurant.",

    "text": "They were pretty busy when we arrived and we were quoted a 30 min wait which really ended up being 15mins...so good there. The menu looked decent, lots of chili features... but average sports bar food.   Once seated and greeted we ordered two shots and two beers. The shots came in sticky glasses and one of the beers had a floater in it. Thankfully, our server was nice enough to switch my beer out for a new one.   I ended up ordering a PBR Burger with french fries and my boyfriend ordered chicken fingers. After seeing the chicken fingers, I kind of regretted getting a burger. The burger was vooked as requested, but it just wasn't what I was desiring. The chicken fingers appeared to be panko breaded. My boyfriend also got the Doritos mac and cheese which really was just average mac and cheese with crunched Doritos on top... don't let your curiosity get the best of you here...the mac and cheese is not all that great.   Honestly, the best part of my meal was the french fries. They were so crunchy and golden, just like I prefer them. If it weren't for the french fries and the exceptional service, I likely would have given this place lower stars. So thank you Bronson for your excellent service and patience with my family...and PBR do NOT change your french fries!!  *2017 Yelp Review Challenge: 1/100*",

    "text": "This was horrible!  There is not a nice or diplomatic way to put it.  So disappointed it is unreal.  First, we ordered show tickets through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FLasVegas.com&s=05b213391376c3cc7cf2ec43ee7f4216678bb7f32154cbbf0abb2a546444e9e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LasVegas.com</a> and the dinner package included the tickets to the PBR Rock Bar and Grill.  We were able to walk right up and be seated right away. Great, looks good.  Then the hostess gives us this \"special\" menu.  Limited menu is what it should say. I mean...you get no choice for an appetizer...really it was not even an appetizer, it was the house salad...just a plain green salad.  No choice of salad dressing.  Just that is that and no substitutions.  Mind you, the PBR Rock Bar and Grill has a pretty decent sized menu.  I had looked it up online and was wanting the California Chicken Sandwich all day!  Nope, not gonna happen.   The entree consisted of 5 choices.  Two of them were salads, macaroni and cheese, vegetable fajitas (who wants that!) and then ribs.   So pretty much the only decent choice was ribs!  Why not cut out the salad and dessert and just let someone order what they want to eat.  Seriously...the salad and dessert were not wanted and wouldn't have been ordered.  We sat there looking at our pathetic menu for 25 minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge that we were there.  Seriously, 25 minutes and for an already irritated person, this was like an hour.  Our waiter finally showed up.  We ordered our drinks...a beer and a soda as well as the food for dinner and the dessert, they had us order it all at once.   I ordered Mac and Cheese and other half ordered ribs.  Drinks took another 15 minutes and mine was diet...I did not order diet.  Nasty.  Seriously waited another 20 minutes to tell the waiter that it was the incorrect soda.  The bus boy brought salads.  Green salad with a couple croutons and pieces of radishes.  Ranch was the dressing served...Gross.  I was so hungry, ate mine.  Other half does not like ranch dressing so he didn't even eat his.  Another 25-30 minutes and our food comes out.   The ribs looked decent, but it was just like 4 ribs covered in BBQ sauce on a piece of bread??  Side of regular mac and cheese with it.  Mine was the PBR mac and cheese.  NASTY!  It was disgusting.  Cold and watery.  I cannot believe they serve this to people.  Just horrible.  I ate a few bites and watched my other half finish his ribs.  I mean, this was bad, not good in any way.  I couldn't even complain because the waiter didnt come back.  If you are going to serve of a minimal menu then at least make the food good.  Seriously.  This was a joke. How do you mess up Mac and cheese.  Then there was a dessert that came with dinner.  You got a choice of strawberry shortcake or root beer float.  I wanted neither, but when we ordered our food we had to place our dessert order as well.  Weird!  Annoyed to say the very least.  So we just said one of each when we ordered.  (Mind you, I would not have ordered any of these options if I had been able to order off the regular menu...none of these...not one!) Strawberry shortcake was a cold, hard, non iced donut with whipped cream and some strawberries.  Not good... It was not restaurant quality.  It was, yeah I got some left over four day old plain Krispy Kremes and a can of whipped cream...grrrr.    No, never mind.   Four day old Krispy Kremes would probably still taste good. Grrrrr. Then his float was just a scoop of ice cream and a bottle of root beer with it on the side.  Not prepared.  Just a glass, scoop inside and a bottle served with it.  This whole night was terrible.  I honestly have not had such a bad experience in a restaurant in years.  The food was bad, service was bad, the place was not full, so there was just no excuse.  It was just ridiculous all the way around.   Over an hour of waiting for horrible bar food.  The only thing that saved this night was that the show we went to was great.  This place I would avoid like the plague!  Not a good restaurant at all. The cost of the tickets and the show package should have allowed a decent menu or allow someone to choose from the regular menu and nix the salad and dessert that we didn't want anyway. This was not a deal at all.   We would have much rather just bought the show tickets and then bought dinner some where else...McDonald's would have been a thousand times better.  This place really didn't deserve any stars but that was not an option for me. My advice to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FLasVegas.com&s=05b213391376c3cc7cf2ec43ee7f4216678bb7f32154cbbf0abb2a546444e9e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LasVegas.com</a>... There are many other restaurants to choose from for packages.   Pfftt..",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that had I known PBR is the acronym for Professional Bull Riding, we would not have ended up here (that makes me think 'country music' rodeo, etc which I have no interest in whatsoever) - but I'm so glad we did!!!   We were exhausted, didn't care to walk much, & hangry on Sunday night of a holiday weekend when we found ourselves at Miracle Mile. We chose this spot off the directory not wanting greasy fast food but also wanting a decent meal in a casual atmosphere.   We were seated immediately next to the bar area and behind some retail racks which was cool - we could people watch the foot traffic entering Miracle Mile from the strip and also could listen to the DJ & MC while watching the numerous drunk brides-to-be ride the bull as they mimicked riding their man only to be thrown face first from the bull - it was loud but some good entertainment!! And the music wasn't country either, for which I was pleasantly surprised. We also enjoyed watching the DJ pretend he was working hard mixing the music when the pop music playing was just the straight tracks LOL  Our party of 3 ordered ribs, a sandwich, & the ribeye. The food was good but the ribeye, although tasty, was surprisingly a bit tough (probably the worst ribeye had in a long time). We enjoyed the free glasses for ordering a particular size brew and shake - & took advantage leaving with our souvenirs.   Service was good.  I rarely pay so IDK about value of our meal but the shake in souvenir glass was $14.95 O_O. The Nutella shake was good & even came with a full size sprinkled donut adorning the straw, but $14.95?  A lil pricey if you ask me. Oh, & there's only 4 shake flavors, not the long list as displayed on the menu at the front near the hostess (disappointing).  All in all it was a good, entertaining choice & worth the experience.  If we ever go back, we'll just have to step it up and ride that bull ;D",

We sat outside at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender. Everything was nice and clean and there were quite a few people sitting out there. We started out by ordering a couple of drinks, after looking over the menu we realized they had fried pickles (our favourite) so we went ahead and ordered some of those as well. Service was really quick and all the staff there were super friendly. Food came out and OMG was it good! Some of the best fried pickles. What went from \"let's have a drink and go\" turned into sitting at the bar for over 3 hours enjoying cocktails and having a good time.  Loved watching all the people trying to ride the bull. Will definitely be coming here again next time we are in vegas. I highly recommend this place!",

Great idea for live music but unfortunately this particular band was too much like karaoke and the lead singer was not that great.  He solicited song from the crowd and a few customers screamed out \"Prince\" and he said Prince was above his pay level.... then proceed to play Sweet Child of Mine but Guns n' Roses... yet a karaoke classic but did it no justice. The food was disgusting and the service was horrible. This is definitely a place to sit out, drink and sing karaoke favorites with a mediocre band. Maybe if I drank the music would have sounded better and the food would have tasted better and the service wouldn't have mattered.",

Rule #1: come here for craft beer and/or cocktails (because the food is awful)  Rule #2: you have to like loud music blasting 70s - now rock music.   Rule #3: notwithstanding rules 1 and 2, order the fried pickles. Those are awesome!  Since I like rock music, craft beer, fried pickles and have been known to plow a few drinks .. is it any wonder that I came to this bar three times today?!  Try the \"8 Seconds\" cocktail, but substitute Knob Creek instead of Bullet bourbon . This will give it the kick it needs and oh what the heck, you're in Vegas baby so drink 2 or 5.",

Earlier in the day we were approached by a promoter for 2 for 1 drinks. We were actually looking for a place to eat at the time so we decided to try this place. When we sat down the table had a promotional flyer on the table. It was happy hour!! It was great, they half off draft and 2 for 1 drinks too. We all decided to get the 2 for 1 drinks. We also ordered their tailgater special. It was a bunch of appetizers for approx $50. It said it fed 4-6 people. It sounded like a great deal. Here is where it all went downhill.  The food was cold! It tasted good but it seemed to have been sitting for a while before it got to the table. When they arrived it seemed like smaller portions. Half a pretzel? Really!?  Then, the bill arrived and all of a sudden it wasn't 2 for 1 drinks anymore. They FAILED to tell us that on \"game day\" the drink specials aren't valid. NO WHERE does it say on the promotional flyer any exclusion NOR did the waitress let us know. Shady. Don't waste your time and try a different place, there are so many around.",

She seemed miffed when I stuck my ground and just accepted the post card. Whatever.   Rum & Coke: Strong! I think they're generous with the alcohol!   Chopped salad: pretty good. A little on the sour side, but the pepperchinis (sp?) were a nice little surprise.  Beef Brisket: good!  PBR Burger: really good!  Chocolate chip cookie dessert: was not a \"chocolate chip\" cookie, more of a chocolate cookie; would not classify it as a \"generous helping\" per the menu description. Cookie could have been a little warmer. Ok.  Water: tasted like tap  Bathroom: clean but smelled like a public bathroom. The stall I went in ran out of toilet paper and one of the paper towel dispensers was empty. A manager just happened to be in there and she took care of everything right away.  Super plus: charging station at the table!  Waiter: Aaron - nice, polite  Overall: good; gotta roll myself out of here bc I'm so stuffed; def a place to come to again.",

Everything else was just for convenience (if you call walking nearly a mile from the Venetian to Planet Hollywood convenient).  Overall, things were meh at best - it wasn't all that busy but it took a good 15 minutes after we were seated before we even got water, let alone any actual service.   Once we had decided, and someone finally came over to take our order, we ended up with a table full of drink and food.   My boyfriend and I split the 100oz Caribbean Sunset, which we paired with the Bucking Bull Fries, the smoking hot chicken bites, and the Chicken and Waffles.   Overall, everything was good, but nothing really stood out and made our meal memorable.  Not even the large cocktail - and to be honest it was mostly ice and fruit juice.  We had a decent experiance but likely won't be back if next time we are in Vegas.",

So we ordered a few dishes to share:  Whiskey Dip (beef brisket dip Sammy) Mac n' Cheese deep dried balls Combo Platter (brisket & ribs)  In addition you could purchase a 33oz Bull Rider or 20oz Bull Fighter (you keep the glass) and the refills are $5.00.  It totally works with the live band and you definitely will not be disappointed.  The food was really flavorful (especially the deep fried tomatoes).

They had March Madness on multiple TV's - that's pretty much the only good thing about this place...and oh, the bull too.  The girls that work here seem disinterested in their job and life in general. They have that \"FML\" look. We grabbed a few drinks here after dinner and watched basketball. The margaritas were ok. I wanted something strawberry so I ordered a strawberry daiquiri which our server told me not to get since it's like \"drinking a Slurpee\" - we had been drinking and I just want strawberry anything - can I just have whatever I want to drink? I got my daiquiri, it was just as sugary as what I was expecting and I was ok with that.  From the patio area, we moved inside when the mechanical bull caught our attention. Our server may have thought we were trying to take off without paying...by going inside? WTH? That woman had issues.  We were watching and laughing at people riding the bull - guys, girls, a bride, bridesmaids. I've never been on a mechanical bull. Somehow, I ended up riding it myself and surprisingly enough, I stayed on for 20 seconds despite wearing a dress. I had fun and wanted to do it again...until I saw the bruises on my inner thighs. But it's all good.",

But then our food came out & no appetizer :( so we let our grumpy waiter know since our main course is already out he can cancel the appetizer. His response? Instead of a quick \"oh my bad - yeah I'll take it off\" he replies back with \"you never ordered an appetizer \".... -_- my friend and I just looked at each other and laughed. We were so over it by this point.   The whole time he seemed annoyed & eager to move to the next table, short with his answers, etc. His service gets the place a 1 but the food saved the overall rating.",

TVs everywhere to enjoy whichever sport you'd like, and a Bull ride if you dare (don't eat before please!) We ordered:  Caprese salad: The grilled chicken was extremely moist and delicious, and the vegetables were fresh. My only gripe is that it was overdressed, making the salad mix limp and overly soggy.   Sweet potato tots: I don't see this very often, so I just had to try it! Definitely an experience...I think I like sweet potato fries better, but this was a neat way to munch on somethin' sweet--especially since they give you maple syrup on the side!  Firecracker cole slaw: My buddy and I both expected something hot and spicy, but there were poprocks inside the slaw! Interesting concept, though it wasn't to my liking.   Brisket: Yummm...fall apart tender with a good BBQ sauce on top. It wasn't the best brisket I've had, but this isn't exactly a BBQ joint made JUST for BBQ...so it's A-OKAY in my book!  My friends also got chicken and waffles (he DEVOURED it...must've been good) and Doritos Mac N' Cheese, which was also pretty good and unique. Overall, I'd say to grab some grub over here if  you can't figure out what to eat, but want to watch the game. Great American food with plenty of entertainment to give you and your friends a great time!",

Service was great, our waiter was excellent ( sorry didn't get his name). We ordered some wings ( the lime/tapatio highly recommend) and burgers. Everything was very delicious expecially the fries. Everything was going great, everyone was happy smiling having a great time when suddenly the people next to us started to get loud. As always I try not to stare or be noisy but my husband was closer and had a better view. Well looks like a female that was waiting was looking at the game when a male that was on that direction started telling her \"what are you looking at\" confused the girl apologized and said she was looking at the game.  Well I guess it wasn't enough for the male that he started to cuss her out, to the point were she started to cry. Some not sure if it was a waiter or manager went to the male and his party and was talking to them but it was not good enough. The male was still being loud, so the couple left. As the couple was leaving the females male components was trying to tell the hosstage that that party were being very rude. Well the male in the group started to use fowl language to a point that my family and I also had to leave.  I don't think we will be returning not because of the food, food was excellent but because I think that this place didn't do the right thing, they let the wrong person leave and didn't do much to ask the problem causers  to leave.  To me that's not good customer service.",

    "text": "Just to give you some perspective, I had to create a yelp account just to write this.  This was my first time in Vegas so I was your typical tourist walking up and down the strip looking for a place to grab a drink. It was 5:00 PM so I was looking for a place to cash in on a happy hour deal and watch some sports.   Since this was a Wednesday night in November there were little options for sporting events. However, the Penguins were playing the Capitals, which if you know anything about hockey you should know that's worth throwing on one of the 50 tvs they have. Instead they had replays of MAC football games and the NFL network on (remember this is a Wednesday).  So ok, they made a mistake. As the only person at the bar I kindly asked them to turn on the hockey game. The sweet bartender said she will find a manager who has permission to do so(which she did). However the manager (who seemed like a real douche) couldn't complete this simple task. Therefore, I was forced to be that guy who asked them to turn on the game three times.   On top of this, their fire alarm came on and everyone on their staff just continued on working. I asked the bartender if we should be concerned and evacuate, in which she replied, \"no, this happens all the time\".   The game eventually came on and I was already face deep into buy one get one gin & tonics plus happy hour food specials so I stayed. Moral of the story, you can certainly find a better place to get some food and enjoy a drink. They are awarded one star for their kind bartender and cheap deals (compared to other places on the strip).",

We've been here probably 3-4 times, and there's a reason we keep coming back! Good food, fun atmosphere, and we always leave with leftovers! Is it a little pricey? Of course it is, you're in Vegas on the strip! What did you expect?   We had tempura pickles (fried pickles) as an appetizer and they were great! So were the chips that came with it! The buffalo chicken flatbread was great, more than enough for one person! My parents had burgers and they said they were fantastic!  Also, if you do ride the bull, fully expect a nice bruise on your thigh to appear by the next day  but still a fun experience and worth it!",

Luckily we weren't charged for the drinks, but then again we shouldn't have been because we ended up sending them back.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. Prior to my recent trip to Vegas, I had come across quite a bit of information regarding PBR. All of the photos and information made it seem like a fun, interesting place.  A few of us needed a quick bite after a long walk perusing the strip. Of the choices around Miracle Mile, I opted for PBR based on the above. We entered where a sign said \"entrance\", but had to ask a server if we were to seat ourselves only to be shown the hostess stand opposite of the \"entrance\" sign. Not a big deal, but a little confusing (saw others do the same as we did).   We were seated outside, and opted to order appetizers as we wanted to get back to our adventures on the strip. I ordered a drink that claimed to have a favorite rum of mine in it, and a side of fries. The drink was good enough, but I'm not sure it contained any alcohol as I certainly could not taste even a hint of the rum. The fries were edible, but I wouldn't care to pay for them again - reminiscent of Burger King fries and were lukewarm at best. Another I was with ordered the Bucking Bull Fries, and was equally displeased, as was the one who ordered the Signature Wings.  The server was pleasant, but she disappeared for a long time halfway through our quick stop (went on break?) -- halfway really being about the time we were ready to leave. Our quick stop turned into being there for almost an hour. A couple of us even left as we waited for the server to return to take payment. (We were told that she claimed to have had most of the tables due to it being really busy and apparently short-handed - the patio was not even half-full and the inside area was maybe half-full -- if that is really busy, then I would hate to see the service when the tables are actually filled).  I also couldn't tolerate the music that was played outside, which seemed to be mostly a hip-hop type - more club-esque than what I'd expect at a \"rock bar & grill\". The music being played indoors seemed a lot better, and I wish we had been given an option of whether we had wanted a table indoors or out.  The only pro was the people watching, but I would have much preferred doing this as I spent my time enjoying Vegas and not unnecessarily waiting around while being subjected to bad music.  At least I know now to avoid this place on my next trip.",

We went in there around 10 at night and just wanted to something to munch on b/c we had not eaten dinner and no one seemed hungry enough to sit down somewhere and order a late night dinner.  So, the 5 of us decided to order about 4 different appetizers including the fried pickles, potato skins, buffalo wings, and buffalo fingers.    My first experience with fried pickles was a bust and I had high hopes.  There was way too much cornmeal involved.  While I did actually like the buffalo fingers and potato skins...all of that went out the window because of the honest to goodness douchetard waiter we had.  I'd like to say I remember his name, but all I remember was his purposefully lopsided mohawk and his disgustingly rude attitude.  Granted, we came in and just ordered appetizers and my friends had ordered their huge yard drink before we came in.  But was it really necessary for him to tell us how annoyed he was about these things?  He was a jerk and told us he would shoot himself in the head if we wanted to separate our checks at the end of our meal.  And no...he was not joking.",

I love the fact that this bar has an outdoor seating area equipped with misters. It wasn't especially hot the day I was there, but the misters were very refreshing.   Our server was very quick with service and took good care of us. There were lots of TV's to watch football. It was fun to see so many different teams represented.   The menu was a little confusing, but had a lot of options. There are large, fish bowl type drinks, a couple beers on tap, a cider, and bottles. Not a great selection. I know it's a PBR bar but nothing they had really appealed to me. I considered a mixed drink, but all it showed on the menu was their $45 fish bowls. Another comment on the menu, it was grossly sticky and worn down. When it's just a paper menu, it gives a bad first impression that they're used 500,000 times before you get it. I didn't quite understand why there were fries and such included, but then a list of items on the side.   Now for the food. I ordered the fajita's. They came quickly and were delicious. The food tasted fresh and was worth the $15. The only problem was that there were only 4 corn tortillas and enough food for 9 tortillas.   The overall feel of the place was nice, but a little dirty. They could use a little more attention to detail and new menus and this place could easily be 4-5 star rating.",

    "text": "1 star for the bartender being a thief...... OK we were doing the VEGAS thing so we decided to buy some of those HUGE drinks , 100oz or something like that. We had been Bar hopping for a few hours already and we came across PBR.. Went in and had a few drinks. On our way out one of the girls from our party eye balled the big drink she went up to the Bartender and asked if they were available; Rudely she answer, \" If they are there, then we obviously we have them.\" Really lady, she was asking because you might be out of them, which by the way some other bar was. Anyway that's not the worst of it, we still ended up buying 3 of those things and the Girl from the bar asked if we wanted some extra shots for a few extra dollars, I asked how much alcohol the drink had already and she said \" not much maybe like 8%,\" For me that would be too low but for the 3 girls who bought the drinks they thought it would be ok so we did not pay extra for shots..... Wells Guess what???? The freaking drinks came with no alcohol to begin with, she sold us Virgin Drinks ad alcohol beverages. She is lucky we didn't find this out until we were long gone. Anyways PBR should had reimbursed us for those drinks, but I didn't feel like being an A-hole and getting the girl fired, because in my book that is consider STEALING........ and we tipped her SMH.  2 THUMBS DOWN",

The hostesses at the hostess stand inside had no clue.  The first one told us there was no open seating outside.  The second one said she didn't handle outside seating and there was a different hostess outside we needed to see.  We went outside and were seated next to one of the long fire pits, which was nice since it was a little chilly.  Service was pretty bad, we had to flag someone down after 8 minutes or so to get our food ordered.  I ordered the blackened chicken fettucine and the bf ordered the chili cheese dog.    Shortly after we ordered, they had an issue with the fire pits and had to keep lighting and relighting them, leaning over various customers and their tables.  Our food took a little long to come out, but was right when it did.  It was average tasting, nothing worth coming back for.  The blackened chicken fettucine was spicy, as promised by the menu.  The chili dog was huge!  My two cents are to try someplace of which you might have higher expectations.",

    "text": "I usually don't take the time to write a review, but I have no problem making time for this place.   I was traveling from out of town with a group of about 25 people to Las Vegas from Southern California. We visit Vegas twice a year as a group and wanted to change up our normal routines to something different. We were excited to give this place a try. About half of our group arrived early and was greeted at the door by someone with wristbands for $5 drinks and free mechanical bull ride with receipt of your first drink. Awesome right? We thought so... so we all get our wristbands, buy a round of drinks and settle in to this completely empty bar looking forward to the night ahead. After about 10 minutes in the bar changed bartenders, we went up for drinks and the bartender informed us that our wristbands were no good and that it was only for women. No problem, this wasn't going to ruin our night. So one of the girls in the group goes to buy a drink as well as a round for her boyfriend. The bartender notices that she's buying a drink for herself and for one of the men and immediately becomes confrontational with the female. She then proceeds to slam the register drawer shut and toss the pen on to the bar. At this point we request the manager who comes out to try and calm the situation down and explains that there was a mix up and they would not be honoring the wristbands for the men but would honor it for the women.   Moments later, the bartender becomes confrontational with one of the women again and then begins using outrageous and unprofessional language at the group. We obviously at this point decided to leave, so we briefly waited outside in the main hall for the rest of the group to arrive as well as for food that had been ordered. A security guard is then sent to the door and enters the hallway where he says that we will have to move on somewhere else.  I can't even say enough bad things about this place and our experience here. Was literally the worst half hour we have ever had in Las Vegas and I'm still in disbelief at how disrespected a group of 25 paying customers would be treated, especially considering the whole problem was originally stemmed from their own mistake. It's clear to me why this place was empty on a Saturday night in Las Vegas.",

The server repeatedly forgot drinks we had ordered and then would disappear for what seemed like forever.   The worst thing was, my food sucked. I ended up scarfing down some of my friends BBQ chicken pizza because my buffalo chicken pizza, that sounded so good, in reality was not. It just tasted hot. Like burn my mouth hot. But no buffalo flavor. Does that make sense? It just wasn't good.   I'd probably still buy the cheap drinks at their bar or counter in PH, but i wouldn't come and eat again. Stick to the drinks! Don't tell me I didn't warn you!",

    "text": "There is no guarantee of tomorrow. It is so important to make the most of each day and night. My dear friend Christie and I made the most of last Friday night when we met her lifelong friends at PBR Rock Bar.     From a local's perspective, driving to PBR Rock Bar is a nightmare. It is not like the Voodoo Lounge or Level 107 Lounge where you pull in from a 4-lane arterial into a well designed parking garage. The local has to maneuver through the mayham of the Strip area traffic. The worst part is maneuvering through the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile parking garage. It is a poorly designed parking lot without notice that the motorist is driving the wrong way. Once the local finds the parking spot, it is a walk through the corridors of Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood to reach PBR Rock Bar where the mall touches the Las Vegas Strip. Now, If your vacationing on the Strip, PBR Bar is a short walk off the sidewalk.    PBR Rock Bar is really two different bars under one business. You have the indoor bar and nightclub overlooking the mall and the outdoor bar and nightclub patio overlooking the mid Strip. This is where the high energy is. When you look up you could see the Cosmopolitan tower, when you look straight you see a Las Vegas Strip bordered by Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan. In the near distance the intermittent Bellagio Fountains dance and the Eiffel Tower stands tall. In the near distance, the sidewalks are prime people watching. Looking into the bar, there stands the mechanical bull. The mechanical bull is really a symbol of their business practice. They really take the customer for a ride by charging different prices for the exact beverage. That is bull!  In hindsight I regret not riding the mechanical bull. I think it would of been a lot of fun. In reality, my eyes and attention were on my company. The volume of the music was at a decibel where we could hear one another. Christie and I started out in the indoor bar. When you arrive from the Planet Hollywood parking garage, you enter through the indoor bar. From this angle, the outdoor patio is camouflaged by a wall and dim interior. After Christie's friends called her we'd find our way to the outdoor patio. This is where we'd spend around 3 hours of our lives.      There is an admission price for guys. Even guys who drink girl drinks :-). The admission is $10. But it includes a drink. For the Las Vegas Strip this is a decent deal. The average drink on the Las Vegas Strip is $12. And if I'm not mistaken, a 22 ounce beer upstairs in Twin Peaks is $10. Once your in the bar, a click on the Yelp application illuminates the buy one get one free drink check-in. The average drink is around $12. By the conclusion of the 3 drinks, people ought to be up in Space Mountain-a state of a nice relaxing buzz.      By the time I drank the three drinks, I was up in Space Mountain enjoying a nice relaxing buzz. I enjoyed two Blue Hawaiins and a Bahamas Mama. Supposedly they are girl drinks. But I got to be a man and tell the truth. They were delicious but nothing spectacular. The bartenders didn't even bother to add a maraschino cherry. They came in a plastic cup. They were a delicious route to get to Space Mountain. They taste like fruit punch with alcohol. Now high up in Space Mountain,  I thought I was being funny and managed to drink Christie's Whiskey Neat. I am no connoisseur on whiskey, but it was decent and put me to the summit of Space Mountain. When I brought Christie, a replacement Whiskey Neat I was incognizent to the idea that the bartender charged different prices for the exact drink. I'd end the night with the least expensive beer. It was PBR. Although I was in no state to keep track of the price, I think it was $5.    Now back to Earth and off Space Mountain,  when I reflect on PBR Rock Bar, I see 3 stars. I dislike the inconsistency in price. However, there is a high energy level to the place. Its setting on the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of the Cosmopolitan Tower and in the sightlines of The Bellagio Fountains and Eiffel Tower is high energy. $25 for a nice buzz is a good deal. Most of all I enjoy the memories of spending three hours here with my friend and her friends.",

The first plan was Voodoo, but the cover was stupid. Here, ladies were free & gents paid $10 and received a free drink ticket. There's a Yelp buy one-get one check in offer. Shoulda used it.   We were a little confused and didn't realize my friends were in same bar, just on patio overlooking Strip. The view was nice and misters kept things cool. What was not cool was the fact that different barkeeps charged $8-$11 for a whiskey neat. Pisses me off. Had this not occurred, it would be a 3* experience.   The company was great, watching fools ride the bull was fun...but the \"I'll choose how much to charge\" pricing left me feeling taken advantage of. Or, my friends who replaced my disappearing whiskey :) Daniel enjoyed his Girl Drink Drunk Blue Hawaiians and Bahama Mama's. Aside from great times with awesome people, I'll pass on a return visit.

And if that wasn't enough to share, we also had an order of Breakfast Skins. Potato skins topped with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheddar cheese.

On the 2nd night we brought our kids up for dinner and decided to eat at Rockbar! We had a great time! Such a fun place, great atmosphere, great staff and my 10 year old son had a blast on the mechanical bull... Our waitress Joanna C made this night extra special and super fun for all of us! Plus the food is out of this world... Pulled pork fajitas were delicious and the fact that they still serve pancakes for dinner was a total win for my kids of course! Lol!",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying, I started this Yelp account solely on the experience here.   Let's see, where shall I begin....before even going in, we were looking at the menu on the outside at which one of the hostess gave us a 10% off if we decided to eat there. We saw some entrees we would eat on the menu so we went in. First, the waiter was very friendly. We went during lunch. It wasn't busy at all. It apparently was happy hour but they said you had to go to a separate bar however, no one was at that bar.   Once we were ready, we ordered our drinks, appetizer and food. Our lunch came out before our appetizer. When the waiter realized it, my husband refused it at that point but the manager came out and said she would comp it so we agreed to take it, even though it was late and pointless.   The food was average. The sweet tea was delish though!!   While waiting to receive our bill, one of those outside camera ladies came up and asked if we would like our picture taken. She had a very strong accent so it was really hard to understand her but just said \"sure\" anyway. When she came back after developing the photos and showing us the cost, we refused and she was a bit annoyed and rude about it. Whatever.  Once we got our bill, we noticed the appetizer was not comped. We didn't say anything cause we figured if we got comped for the appetizer, we wouldn't use the 10% off. Then the waiter noticed we had the 10% off so he said \"oh, I didn't see that, I will adjust the bill.\" When he came back, the amount wasn't even touched. We paid for the appetizer we didn't want since it was late but agreed to take cause we were told it would be comped AND we didn't even get the 10% off they gave us at the door.  Will we be back?? NO!! I recommend you stay clear of this place and their False advertisement!!!!!!",

She walked us through the menu (which is quite large) and made several honest suggestions. While most places say \"everything is good\", Shannon was candid and immediately made us feel like a friend! She wasn't pushy, she took the time to understand our likes and dislikes, and really made for a memorable experience! Prices are extremely reasonable for the strip, the ribs were excellent and although she warned us we may be ordering too much food, we got so caught up in the moment that we still managed to spend $100! Well worth it! We'll be back!",

    "text": "You know it's bad when the worst decision I made in Vegas was going to PBR Rock Bar & Grill...  Besides taking forever to receive our food, it wasn't correct when it came out. I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and was delivered a cheese pizza with pieces of chicken on it. After waiting 15 minutes to flag down my waitress and tell her it was the wrong order I was finally able to send it back to the kitchen for a new one. The server came back 10 minutes later with the SAME pizza and a side of buffalo sauce. I told him this pizza had tomato sauce on it and the one I ordered did not, it had buffalo sauce. Despite showing him the menu, he said the chef wouldn't make a different one. I was going to just suck it up and eat the pizza until I tried a bite of it and it was terrible.   At that point I knew I didn't want it so I then had to wait another 15 minutes for the waitress to finally come back and tell her that I never got the right pizza. She agreed and I ordered a salad instead. Finally got the salad, and by that point my wife was completely done with her meal... which she thought was pretty terrible too.  Don't go here. Terrible service. Terrible food.",

The first time, we had five different servers over the course of our meal, had to wait an hour for the food to come out, then had to send it back three different times because it wasn't right.  And we ordered chili dogs.  Really?  The second time, we actually intended to go to Earl of Sandwich, but their registers were malfunctioning so they couldn't take orders.  Starving, we ended up back at PBR.  We were seated promptly, but then we sat for a total of twenty minutes without one server even looking our way.  The place wasn't exactly packed either, and all the servers were just standing around watching someone ride the electric bull.  When I walked out, I let the hostess know that we had been sitting for a long time with no service.  Her response?  She just laughed hysterically.  Umm, that's not an appropriate reaction to a customer complaint.",

I should have known this place was going to be bad news when I walked in and saw a mechanical bull with a line of really LARGE women wearing skimpy clothing, making multiple attempts to catapult themselves onto the bull. FKN BARF!   On to the restaurant, we were seated promptly but after that it all went downhill. Waitress took our drink order of WATER and came back with 6 glasses 15 mins later! Another 10 mins go by and she finally comes to take our food order. 30 mins later, dreadlocked guy comes to our table and says that he will be our new server. Another 30 mins later still no food. We ask server where the hell our food is at and he says \"Well for a party of your size it takes longer.\" WTF! We had SIX people. Give me a break. Food finally comes out after we waited an hour and we inhaled in 10 minutes because we had absolutely no time to waste. Please keep in mind that the restaurant was not busy AT ALL from the time we started eating til the time we finished. Freaking unbelievable. I will never make the same mistake again. Also, BEWARE of bros and bro hoes! They are running amuck in here!",

    "text": "First of all anyone who gives this place anything under four stars is just ridiculous!  My husband and I ate there two times, and every single thing we ate was awesome!    We were taken there by my stepson and his friend who had eaten there before and honestly if we go back we WILL go again and will take whoever we are with!  We had dinner one night, and before we left Vegas we went back for breakfast.  So let me tell you about my two favorites there.  First off I think they are called Bucking Bronco Fries or something like that.  French fries, smothered in nacho cheese sauce, topped with bacon, onions, and of course a drizzle of buffalo wing sauce..OMG!!! I am going to attempt to make these, but I can't imagine I can make them like this!  Very large portions on everything!  Second I am a big omelet person, and so the first time we went for breakfast I didn't see one so we went elsewhere.  Finally I went, my husband wanted the fries again, and so I tried the breakfast burrito..AMAZING!  First off it is huge and PACKED with the fillings, I could not finish this.  The green sauce they put on top is simply the best and I would love to buy a freakin jar full of it!!!    I say when you see Yelp reviews and most are high and only a few are low, GO FOR IT!  Give it a try and make your own review.  For me this is one of those places I am glad I tried, it was truly one of my favorites of all my Vegas food stops : )",

    "text": "I wish I could give them 0 stars.  We made a point of visiting PBR while NASCAR was in town (March 9-11, 2012) only because of their PBR promotional flyers & website ads which read: Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.  I was in charge of picking the bar to enjoy the Saturday (Nationwide) race. Out of all the sports bars (or bars for that matter) in Las Vegas, I brought our group of five to PBR because of the promotion. We planned on eating and drinking for two hours and then enjoy the free drinks an hour after the race and then take 10% off the dining portion of our bill. Unfortunately things did not go that way.  I made a reservation via OpenTable for five, and when we arrived I asked for the hostess to seat us so we had a tv with a view of the race. She replied, \"we have tvs everywhere, I'm sure you'll see the race.\" She proceeded to sit us at a booth that fit five people comfortably, yet NOT ONE TV HAD THE RACE ON - all were on college basketball. Before the hostess left I said to her, \"can we change a tv to the race?\" She replied, \"only the manager can change the channels - I'll have him come over.\"  The manager does not arrive, but our waitress does. She gives us menus and takes our drink order. I tell her our predicament and she replied she'd send the manager over. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we still hadn't seen the manager and were missing our sporting event. Our waitress apologized profusely and said she didn't know what more to do - she had asked the manager to come over multiple times and change the channel for us. Just to be clear, no one was watching the tv we wanted changed.   Upset I was being ignored and missing the race, I got up, took my bucket of beers and walked over to a table near the bar which had a view of three tvs showing the race. Next a bus boy walks up to our table and says, \"you can't sit here - that table has been assigned to someone else already. You need to visit the hostess to get a table.\" I replied to him, \"No, I am sitting here because I asked to be seated in an area with the race and was not, and your manager is too busy to come and change a damn channel for us - so I am sitting here.\" Of course he didn't like my answer and went to the hostess. Now the hostess comes to our table and says, \"you can't sit here I have this table booked for another party.\" Not only did I repeat my comment, but my husband was even louder. She turned and walked away.  Our first waitress came over to our table and introduced us to our new waiter. In front of us she explained our predicament and told us the bucket of beer would be moved over to a new ticket and apologized she couldn't get the manager to change a channel for us. We told her it wasn't her fault and we would be happy now that we could see the race. She was not upset and our new waiter was happy to serve us. We thought all was on the right track.  Well, we won our bet on the race (YEAH!) but as soon as they waved the checkered flag we asked for our free drinks per the promotion. Our waiter told us the only beer selections were Bud or Bud Light. We don't drink Bud or Bud Light - so we had a well drink. It was healthy and we were happy. As soon as we finished the first drink was asked for a second. Again, we figured since the promotion was an open bar for one hour - the service would be slow and we would get at most three free drinks. Well get this: upon ordering our second well drink our waiter tells us, \"oh, it's just ONE free drink.\" And I said, \"WHAT?!\"  Again, promotion read:  Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, ***as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.*** Where does that say ONE DRINK? BULLSH*T!  At that point I ask for the check because I was through with crappy establishment. And when I asked for the bill I reminded them of the 10% dining discount. This time our waiter said, \"Oh, that discount is if you don't get a free drink - it's either one or the other.\" My husband came unglued! I think I cursed. Our waiter said, \"Let me check though, you are my first customers asking for the discount.\"'  Fuming, I sat at the table thinking about all the other bars we could've enjoyed the race as well as spent our out of town dollar...the food was barely average (I had a salad and my husband had a burger) and the service was horrible from the hostess & manager (waitstaff worked very hard). Our waiter returned and said, \"Sorry, I was wrong, you do get 10% off your dining portion\" as we all made some sort of comment about actually doing what your promotion says.  I am also going to review this horrible establishment on OpenTable too. Seriously people - this place sucked. STAY AWAY!",
