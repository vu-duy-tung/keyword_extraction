We were quick to be seated (as a party of 6) + the service was fast & friendly + a cozy, home-y feeling overall: the makings of my kind of breakfast/brunch joint. We ordered a little bit of everything, as we were surprised by how large the menu was. Classic steak & eggs, lobster omelet, Boca burger, etc. All of which were tasty as heck. I could definitely see myself coming back here sometime soon.",

    "text": "OMG, this place is so delicious. Greg and I have made a habit of trying to get as far away from hotels for food as possible and so the coffee pub fit perfectly into our well oiled machine.   After a simple \"breakfast\" search in our general area, I saw a well rated place with two of my favorite things: coffee and pubs. After clicking through some pictures I came across the a lobster omelet. LOBSTER OMELET. That sold us. Well, me. I sold Greg.   To be honest, I can't even remember what he had, but you can guess what I had. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a \"SOMETHING\" omelet or \"SOMETHING\" scramble, and you get it, and there's egg, there's cheese and assorted accoutrements, but there's only evidence that the \"SOMETHING\" was maybe once a part of the ingredients. Coffee Pub knows no such practice. That was a LOBSTER omelet. It was good. It was lobster-y. It's something I want to eat the next time I go to Vegas. Hell, it's something I want to eat for breakfast today.   As a note, I love me a good potato. Hash browns, baked, mashed, fried, I just love it, but the pub potatoes, or whatever they may have been named, were just ok. Luckily I do remember Greg getting potato pancakes (hash browns) and they were fabulous. So get those.",

    "text": "We LOVE little hole-in-the-wall breakfast/brunch places and this place did NOT disappoint!  We first went here on Mother's Day (2014). I had never heard of this place before and it's sort of situated in a random complex that I never knew had a restaurant nestled among it. The place looks pretty old which totally adds to it's charm. Our waitress was upbeat, friendly, and really made us feel at home. And by that I mean, she really gave us a vibe that made us feel like we were in her house and she was about to whip up a great homemade meal.   I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Our waitress suggested to have the hollandaise on the side since she says that sometimes they can get a little heavy handed on it. I took her suggestion and was glad I did. I love that i was able to have complete control of the amount and now that I have done that, I may continue to order it on the side. The salmon was delicious, thinly sliced, and they served the perfect amount of it. I also ordered the grilled potatoes for the side and they were perfectly seasoned and cooked!  My BF ordered the chili omelette which had the perfect amount of chili to egg ratio. I've had some chili omelets at other restaurants where the chili completely overpowered the rest of the meal, but not the case this time.   Our son ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which were so delicious and perfectly fluffy! He didn't end up eating the whole order (usually he does) because he was a bit under the weather. Our waitress noticed and gave him peppermint tea. I thought that was so sweet of her to do. I was really impressed by her gesture!  The 2nd time I visited this place was with my best friend. Her and I always take each other out for either breakfast/lunch/dinner for our birthdays each year and this year I chose this place.  She ordered the California Benedict (canadian bacon, tomato, spinach, & avocado) & I ordered the Lobster Omelette. Her benedict was delicious, creamy, and had perfectly poached eggs. When I had the first bite of my omelet, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but then I couldn't stop eating it, lol! They put in a really generous amount of lobster that tasted like it was mixed with mayo or cream cheese and scallions. I've never had an omelet with seafood inside of it, but this was surprisingly delicious. It's very rich and although I may not order it again (only because I want to try the rest of the menu), I'm glad that I did!  We will DEFINITELY be back to this place. It is a ways from our house, but it's totally worth the drive.",

The restaurant's walls are covered with autographed photos of famous people who have dined here. I posted some pictures of these but you should take time to walk around and see these for yourself.   My associates all ordered different variations of egg dishes except the Japanese guy who ordered a healthy salad. Everyone was pleased.

I did t catch our server's name, but she was highly energetic and extremely attentive to our entire side of the restaurant. She really made for a great dining experience. I had the lobster omelette. It was super yummy and they don't skimp on any of the ingredients, 4 eggs, lots of lobster salad, pub potatoes and a side of toast. My boyfriend had the pastrami croissant and it was devoured in no time. His meal came with a side of pasta salad. They also served me up a large iced coffee which was a must for this hot Saturday afternoon. If we are ever in the area we will definitely dine there again.",

Enjoyed my meal but at the end our hostess wanted us to pay already and apologised for asking because she explained how it was getting busy inside. If youre in the service industry youre not suppose to rush your guests whatsoever to pay its common sense.

I ordered French toast with a side of scrambled eggs and a 1/2 order of their home style potatoes. Delicious. I was ready to order regular hash browns but was told about the homestyle potatoes. Glad I made that choice. They have a little garlic but perfect amount, slightly toasted, soft, and just right! A Must try. Worth every 5 stars. Go NOW!",

I had viewed their menu online and I knew this was the breakfast to try.  I ordered the omelette with home fries and rye toast.  The omelette was a nice size.  It was filled with the lobster and cheese sauce.  There were some larger pieces of lobster, but most were small pieces.  That didn't detract.  One wouldn't expect a lobster tail in an omelette.  The home fries were very tasty.  Good sized chunks of browned potatoes.  And the rye toast was swirled rye.  Two people, a man and a woman, took orders and brought dishes to the table.  Both were very pleasant and very efficient.    I was so glad they did the Groupon because I never knew this place existed.  Now that I'm a fan, I'll come back and try some other things.  As others have said, the place is a small, cozy restaurant.  I sat in the back area by the coffee counter where they have just 3 tables.  Since it was a holiday and offices were generally closed, it wasn't good people watching.  I will come back to sit on the patio and enjoy lunch there.",

Just fantastic. My server was Lauren and she was the BEST! The moment I walked in she noticed my laptop bag and offered me a table near an electrical outlet. She insisted I take a larger table so I can fit my laptop and meal. When I ordered coffee she read my mind and asked if I wanted water as well (I find that servers rarely ask). She checked up on me the whole 2+ hours I was there.  She offered me plenty of refills and reassured me that I'm welcome to stay as long as I wanted. I never felt rushed or pressured and felt genuinely welcome.  Food was tasty. I ordered a simple egg and sausage and potato dish which is what I always get for breakfast. Coffee was very tasty, too, which is important if you drink coffee black like me. Prices were fantastic.  Ambience was perfect. Noise level and spacing of tables, etc. were great. Free WiFi actually worked unlike half the places that claim to have WiFi. And it was fast; no lags.  This is a great place to come do work, to study, to eat great good, and to feel truly welcome. If I lived in Las Vegas I'd honestly come here at least 4 times a week which is a lot of time to dedicate to one establishment but it was just so great!",

    "text": "Worst service I've had in a long time and it was from the manager/ owner. It's a bummer because it was decent food. I may try them again but not for awhile to give them time to fix all the problems.  The place is small with rickety wood chairs, old plastic cups that had a lot of chips on the edges, some plates were plastic, and cheap silverware.   Wasn't a very professional greeting and taking orders was done so poorly (even by the manager I found out at the end). He didn't right things down and messed up several orders of the people beside us and forgot an item. Why not use a pen and paper?   Every time someone brings a plate of food or drink they'd ask \"who ordered this?\"   They didn't bring either appetizer until I asked and ended up being right before our main meals came.   The appetizer noodles were good but kinda small portion for costing over $4.  The soup in the appetizer section of the menu also came out way late. As soon as the soup came out I said \"doesn't this soup come with a topping?\" I seen pics on yelp that looked different than this I told them. There was a tiny amount of cheese, I gathered it all. There was also only 3 tiny pieces of chicken and made with canned veggies. I should of took pics but was hungry and didn't want the Benedict to get cold so just ate that. Benedict was good at least and good potatoes. 4-4.5 if rated on that meal alone.   Even after expressing displeasure in the soup and having empty drink for a long they let my drink run out again. The servers don't help each other and work their sections. Our server (the manager) just poked his head and looked in the room but wouldn't come check in, it was so weird.   Finally the manager brought the table beside us the pancake he forgot but didn't have it in a to go container when clearly this group was ready to go long before. This manager didn't think about the customer and just in his own planet.   What bumps out from a 1 star is the decent food and the manager trying at the end but it was so frustrating. I asked for a manager and the lady said okay rolled her eyes and laughed! I knew why and that is when I first realized our server was the manager lol.   He heard me out but didn't seem to care all that much. He said \"give us another try and come back tomorrow for free meal\" I said I'll try again but not for at least 2-4 weeks to give you time to update and train employees. After chatting a little longer I asked for my check and he said \"I'll cover this one but you pay next time.\" So he offered me a free meal but but literally 1-2 minutes later changed his mind and said \"you pay next time\". Hahaha to funny.   It was one awkward breakfast so not to likely to be back anytime soon. Hope this review helps keep your expectations realistic at least.   Enjoy",

The bread is warm and crispy, there is A LOT of turkey on the perfect amount of cheese, and then there's tomato lettuce and avocado. Delicious! The sandwich is wrapped perfectly, it is thickly stuffed yet does not fall apart at all while eating until the last bite. Fruit was cool and fresh. Our favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Automatic +1 for another great find off of the strip. Still relatively close if you'd like to venture off. This has all the makings of your traditional down home breakfast joint. It is modest and intimate, but boasts a huge menu with a bountiful selection of breakfast food and a few select sandwiches (nearly all named after California cities). It's comfortable with just the right amount of quirky.  The service was just a little slow, but seeing as it was the Sunday brunch rush, I can hardly fault them for that. All things considered the staff were very friendly, and our server made sure we had everything we needed without being overbearing.   Now food wise: Coffee is top pedigree, comes with real cream and flows freely. After playing roulette between several menu items, I finally settled for the Spanish omelette. (chorizo, onion, potatoes) served with a smatter of salsa and cheddar on top. Usually comes with refried beans, which I love, but just wasn't feeling at the time, so I got a side of potatoes instead. It also came with some flour tortillas on the side. I was pleasantly surprised. Very good quality of food, and the chorizo had just enough zing too it, while still maintaining its potent flavor.  We also ordered stuffed French Toast for the table. Very good, on the threshold of amazing, but it just fell a little bit flat for me. It lacked the \"wow\" factor, I think mainly due to the bread itself falling a little short. It was somewhat thin, and a little conservatively dressed. I guess when I imagine stuffed french toast, I think of over the top, bursting at the seams, a few bites in and you can barely finish it. It was still good nonetheless.  I'm a fan, especially given the price point, quality of food, and the easy to find location. My only real question is who are the nicely dressed people framed on the wall with no name plaques? Frequent diners? legal team? Investors? Founders? Who knows! But I'm determined to keep coming back until I do.",

    "text": "Such a cute hidden gem on Sahara. This little cafe has a small hole in the wall flare that I find an appealing relief here in Vegas. It was a nice reminder that not everything has to be upscale for brunch.  My favorite thing here was the mocha. It was smooth and creamy, so perfect for a breakfast. I decided to order from the specials out front and got the breakfast crepe with chicken, mushrooms and a variety of other vegetables and hollandaise sauce. It was originally paired with asparagus, but I switched that out for hash browns.  I didn't actually like the crepe. There was a cream soup base inside mixed with the chicken and veggies that I found off putting. I did love the hash browns. Jacob absolutely loved his chicken tortilla soup, the fresh tortillas on the side was a great way to start off his breakfast. I'm also not sure what he got for breakfast as he ate it super quickly, but I know it came with their roasted potatoes which he enjoyed as well.  Their servers are well attentive and extremely friendly! This is a cute place I would definitely come back to!  Happy Eating!",

Learn how to make hash browns so they are not a slab of potato  mush with a burnt grilled crust. The eggs Benedict sauce tasted like it was from a can. Oh. Hash browns? Here's a clue.",

I plan on going again, my goal is to try everything on the menu, because everything is described so good. This is an A lister, next to 1-15  Convenient, friendly, and impeccably good.

I do like that it's on the outskirts of the strip, not far at all from the 15 hwy  great location. Love the patio setting they have to sit outside. Greeted immediately walking in, Thumbs up!  Cons: they could really use an update in the cafe. It's super outdated, and the \"older\" look just makes you think that it's automatically dusty and dirty(if that makes sense) although it was clean. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my husband got the breakfast croissant with a side of potatoes. Mine was good, soggy at the end of the burrito, which made it hard to eat... it got really messy and juice all over the plate and ended dripping off the plate to the table to my leg hahaha. Had only the one napkin that came with the silverware. I think you should be given extra napkins automatically when given your food (personally). The waiter wasn't around enough towards the end when I changed my mind to have coffee to ask for it. And then come back to give me or ask me for a refill. There's also no sign by the dining area that says you need to pay in the front.. so we were waiting forever it seemed for our waiter to bring us the check.. seriously towards the end, like never saw him. I think his timing was just bad. He wasn't a bad waiter. He just came too soon after given the meal and then just vanished. No in between at all. - forgot to mention my hubbys sandwich he says tastes like a normal croissant sandwich, wasn't amazing, and wasn't bad either.   I left 2 stars off, one for the super old school decor and the other cuz our service. All In all the place was \"OK\" in our book. Can't really say we will be back..",

I am not a fan of Macaroni Grill or Landry's, and I don't want to be lifted into my house with a crane so I try to abstain from having In n out every day therefore Coffee Pub provides a nice alternative. The staff once they get to know you are incredibly friendly and courteous. They do get swamped, but they will take care of you and make sure you enjoyed your meal. The other day I spotted Carolyn Goodman having lunch there. A few days prior I saw Dina Titus eating at Macaroni Grill...I think I just have a knack for spotting public figures.   Anyway, the menu is huge and the food is solid. Some of it is hit and miss, but some of it is very much hit ,among those being the Lobster Omelet, Tortilla Soup and the La Jolla Sandwich. You can do the half sandwich, soup and pasta salad or fruit combo for like $9. You really can't beat that for freshly made food. The Lobster Omelet is delicious with huge chunks of lobster. I am not a fan of their steak and eggs which my husband seems to enjoy or their huevos rancheros.   Overall, I'd say if in the area give this place a shot for lunch.",

Upon entering the place, it was immediately recognizable as a California Style bistro pub that serves breakfast and sandwiches.  I opted for the veggie omelet and had fruit with sliced tomatoes. The omelet was large with 4 eggs and needed some Cholula for seasoning. Coffee was good and service was friendly. Overall I would say this is just a decent little breakfast joint. I may come back and get a sandwich and update the review with lunch recommendations. We shall see.",

    "text": "Hubby and I loved this place when we discovered it during our trip to Vegas! We loved it so much we came here to eat twice!   Coffee pub feels like you are eating in someone's giant California kitchen. It's homey, comfortable, somewhat lively and very nice.   They offer a small variety of different coffee drinks (which qualifies them to have the word coffee in their restaurant name). When I notice a restaurant calls themselves a coffee shop but they are only serving regular coffee, IMO they don't have the right to call themselves coffee anything.   The food we had was awesome, the portions were big, the prices were reasonable and everything we ate during our two breakfast trips was delicious! I would go into more detail but since we went to Vegas last month already I just remember that we loved it!   If you live in Vegas or you are on vacation and can get off the strip and onto sahara ave. somehow this is the place to be! If we go back this will most likely be our breakfast spot.   The staff was very friendly, and it seems the manager remembered us the next day when we came back!",

They are vegetarians and me being DF (Dairy Free) and GF (Gluten Free) I came across this place. ( Thanks yelpers)   It wasn't busy when we arrived so we had a choice whether to sit inside or outside. It was a beautiful day so we choose to be seated outside. The waiter was friendly and patience as we had a lot of questions as far as substitution for food items that we didn't eat. Our waiter understood our food restrictions and accommodated us. EXTRA STAR!   Most of our food arrived at the same time, but we ordered a lot because the menu had so much to choice from. ( we are foodies when it comes to the right place) we enjoyed every bite. We had time to enjoy our food without being bothered in the middle of us stuffing our faces. She made sure to come and take plates out of the way when she seen them empty.   Coming here jumped started our day!",

It may seem like your food is taking forever to come out, but it's only because they are making it with extra love! I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict, and it was perfect. They even asked me which salmon I preferred the cold one or they had a baked salmon. Talk about options! My friend orders the buttermilk pancakes, and I have never tasted any buttermilk pancakes that taste like that before. It was so light, fluffy, flavorful. I definitely helped my friend eat them! My other friend ordered the stuff French toast which was equally as good, but I did enjoy the pancakes more. We also tried a few of the iced coffees which they actually make with ice cream, now that's a game changer! We had the frozen chai one . Service was great, staff was friendly. This place beats any of those overpriced shitty restaurants on the Vegas Strip. Uber, bike, walk, run, to this place for food! Can't wait until I'm back in Vegas to try their dinner menu!",

As soon as we sat down we immediately eye balled the pumpkin pancakes and all the sandwiches and coffee items, we really wanted to try everything cause it all looked so good!! As we ordered the staff was so friendly and make sure our cups were full, this place gave my mom east coast vibes and it gave me San Diego vibes, this is a really homey feel coffee shop kinda like Gilmore Girls haha, as we were eating the Anna and the staff were giving us recommendations on what to have next, the whole meal experience was amazing and we couldn't get over how much we loved this place already!! Seriously can't wait to come back and try the waffles they had suggested!  Definitely come here if you're wanting to have the best meal experience! 10/10 best coffee pub in Vegas!!!",

A cozy atmosphere with lots of fun photos on the wall of famous and iconic celebrities/prominent figures that have visited in the past. Stop by for coffee or grab a bite to eat. Breakfast or lunch is available until 2pm. We were greeted with the friendliest service and ushered in to take a seat. Even on a Saturday they got us in quickly! Our server Alexis was a sweetheart who genuinely loves her job. She was so helpful with the menu and had such a fun, inviting, and energetic personality. I got the special of the day which was a Turkey Avocado Omelette $9.95 (with egg whites and avocado included!) My favorite part was the shredded carrots and broccoli inside. The ingredients were fresh and the portion was very generous. Very fairly priced. My husband got the pancakes expecting them to be generic, but he said they were exceptionally good! Tip - if you can order the chicken apple maple sausage, it is so worth it! The flavors and charred exterior are to die for!",

There is one waitress that is there everytime (she has short hair, really nice)....she's awesome and is absolutely a reason why the service is also worth five stars",

You can bet many other breakfast/brunch places around this time to have at least a 10 to 20 minute wait.  The service was very friendly and prompt. The decor was casual and comfortable. There is a patio with some tables, but they probably get little use during the summer.  We ordered eggs, pancakes and a chili omelet with potato cakes. Just a note, the potato cakes are not latkes. They are hash browns. That being said, the food was very good and satisfying. The pancakes were fluffy and tasty. The chili in the omelet tasted meaty and fresh.   Definitely a good place for breakfast, brunch or lunch.",

It's pretty tucked away from the busy street and I would've never found this place if it weren't for Yelp!  The service was fast and the people were friendly. We got there right before the crowd came, when there were only 2 tables dining. When we left they were all full and I know why!  So my bf and I couldn't decide on anything because everything sounded yummy! I wish you could add a half order of their amazing French toast to a meal because their stuffed French toast is a lot of food. Which is why we got one savory dish and one sweet dish and split the 2. We decided on blueberries for our fruit filling and they were so fresh. We also ordered the croissant eggs Benedict and oh my.... it was amazing!!!! We glanced at the tables food and they all looked amazingly good. We can't wait to come back and try some other items!!!!  Oh! And did I mention the portions are so worth the price! I think we had the 2 entrees and 2 coffees for less than $30!",

We were greeted and seated very quickly, which is always a plus! After checking out all the Yelp pics, I opted for the stuffed french toast with strawberries. Bae was feeling under the weather and ordered some chicken tortilla soup.  Let's start with the soup. My date was very unimpressed, it lacked spice and flavor. Perhaps ask for some lime with the soup? Or some of those crunchy tortilla chip pieces would definitely up its game. My stuffed french toast was awesome sauce. Didn't even need any syrup, I ate it with a side of whipped cream. The only thing stuffed at the end was me. Haha! Get it?  Besides the soup, the service was another thing I wasn't totally impressed with. The ladies were super nice, don't get me wrong! But it was distracting to sit by the area where all the employees stop and chat. I wish there was a tad more professionalism on their end.",

However it was a little bit disappointing. The place itself is cute, perfect little breakfast nook and the location is good. I ordered a veggie omelette with no cheese, there was a lot of cheese on the omelette.   On the menu I think it says that the omelette comes with potatoes and two slice of toast. I asked our waitress instead of the potatoes can I have fruit instead? And she said yes. Ok perfect.   I order two pieces of sourdough toast with no butter but when I got my order, I got no fruit and had 4 pieces of toast with butter on them.   I normally don't say anything but I told the waitress and before I could finish my sentence, she cut me off and said \"oh I know! they put butter\" and she grabbed the toast pretty quickly and came back with 4 pieces of toast without butter. Still no fruit bowl or potatoes.   I am not the kind of person to speak up when my orders wrong at a restaurant, it's too nerve wracking for me so I never brought it up to her that they forgot my fruit bowl. And I never brought up that my omelette had cheese all over it.  Tip** they do have free wifi you just have to ask for the password   Overall, I MIGHT consider going here again and give this place a second chance. Everyone has their off days right?",

Another waitress brings a plate of pancakes with whipped cream and caramel poured all over the pancakes (not what I ordered) and I asked what those were and she couldn't explain bc she barely spoke English. Out main waitress never came to our table and those pancakes went to the servers counter and sat there supposedly they were for someone else (who also wasn't getting their food).   Another 5min went by and we couldn't wait any longer (35min total) still hadn't received my pancakes. We didn't pay and we got up and left Obviously still hungry and disappointed   6 waiters running around as if they had no clue what they were doing.

    "text": "Just barely ok. The only thing that's keeping this review 3 stars is the service I received from other people besides our waitress, & how good the food was. I've been a server before at a busy restaurant, so I of all people can understand when one has been through a long shift or feels burnt out, but that is no reason to be outright rude to customers who are nothing but polite & don't make complicated orders. If we weren't such happy people, this experience would have ruined our day.  My fiance & I went today around noon during lunch rush when many of the tables outside were taken. I'd read the great reviews & it was the closest breakfast spot so we came with reasonable expectations. After locating the place, we walked in smiling & looking around & immediately an older white lady server barked at us \"RIGHT THERE!\" while pointing us to the two-tops (2 person tables) near the register with the urgency of someone handing off a baton in an ekiden relay. Oookay, we sat down in the dimness & awaited our server.   The place looked understandably busy & after a while a redheaded server asked if we had a menu & after we said no she handed two to us & we asked if we could relocate to sunnier Table 1 by the window. She said sure.    We already had coffee beforehand so we planned to share a meal and add sides to it. Our server came after a few minutes & with no greeting asked what she could get us. I smiled & politely asked a question about the pancakes & she made it seem for all the world like she was thinking \"Hurry TF up\" without ever actually saying it. I dislike feeling rushed, but I hastily made our order of pumpkin pancakes with a side of bacon & asked to hold onto a menu. She left without a word. I looked to my fiance & asked if that seemed rude to him & he agreed she seemed very rude, yet she lacked the frazzled look of a server whose tables were crashing so we figured it was a personal problem.  Seated on the other side of us outside was another couple who was seemingly forgotten & agitated (their table was in the corner but clearly visible through the glass), because about 10 mins later another server had to get our server to that table and it looked like she was apologizing then took their order, got their drinks, & stalked off. It was then I noticed she was pregnant.   A pair of regulars were then seated near us & she treated them more warmly, at least. We had to flag down the nice Japanese male server to ask if we could add to our order a side of eggs & he said sure & went off to relay. About 2 mins later our order came out complete & was brought to us by a really sweet younger white guy who was either a server or food runner & asked if we needed anything else. We said we didn't & dug in.  The pumpkin pancakes were delicious, and the eggs were made perfectly but the star of the show was the bacon, & I don't even really care for bacon actually. They were perfectly crisp, thick, with mostly meat & not oily. The pancakes were warm and yummy, the added whipped cream and pecans were a nice touch. I'd come back for the food but ask not to be seated with Tatiana as our server.   We got through the meal then asked for the check from the redheaded server once again (I wish we could have tipped HER) & our meal ended up costing only $15.60. Our server came back, said \"here's your check, thanks guys!\" to the table of 2 regulars & then slapped the check face down at ours without a word & left. I was actually pretty disgusted with her at this point. We discussed whether we should tip her at all & finally I decided to tip just $2 (the lowest I have ever tipped a server) when she showed up for the first time actually smiling & said we could check out with her. We paid & left. She could have made an easy $5 tip from us if she'd been polite at the very least. I doubt she made $20 in tips the whole shift that morning with that attitude.  Overall, if our server had been better & not bitter as hell, the experience would have been enjoyable. I've worked with burnt out girls who were pregnant in their last trimester who were at the end of their patience but were nicer than Tatiana. I'd go back if only for the food.",

    "text": "I came across this place on Yelp! and I was in the area so I decided to drop by. The place looks pretty cool and the little plaza it's in has some character, as well as the restaurant itself. It was a fresh, beautiful spring day out, so we decided to sit at their patio. We decided to try the special which was the Californian Eggs Benedict and the Smoked Salmon Scramble with bagels and cream cheese. Both plates were tasty and light, so if you want to splurge, you can do so here with out feeling it in your tummy or your wallet since it's reasonably priced.  The food was good, but the coffee was bru-Tal! You would think that since the name of the restaurant is called The Coffee Pub, you'd be able to order a from a selection of coffees and styles...not here! They only have one type, I believe it's Farmer Brothers brand and that's it. I'm not a coffee guru or anything, but this will definitely go on my top ten list of Worst Bad Cup of Coffee's list! Maybe the person making it didn't know how to make it, or maybe they never clean out the coffee maker. Our waitress was 'gung-ho' about it and swears by it everyday...but she wasn't very attentive and I picked up an undertone of ummm...not-so-niceness. On a brighter note, the lady who comes by to refill drinks and to bus tables is very attentive, has an upbeat attitude, and is kind but she does not speak English. No problem for me because I'm bilingual, but she was nice and good at her job.   If you come here, I do not recommend the coffee or the server I had (I didn't get her name), but the food is a little healthier and affordable. I usually like coffee with my breakfast, so I may just go to another restaurant that I know is known for their food and coffee.",

La Jolla is especially good if you are (or in my case with) a vegetarian. Take out the protein and it is a still a very tasty and filling sandwich.  Service is always very good but can be slow on occasion especially during peak times. However it is obvious that the employees always strive to create a positive experience for customers.  One caveat- this is a local place and is not a chain. As a result, there are no $3.99 specials that you would find on the strip. Expect to pay about $12 per plate. Be assured though- the food is worth it.",

I just felt it was way too rich for my taste although the flavor was good and it was loaded with lobster. My wife had a veggie omelet, which was tasty so I think this place has good food but maybe I just got the wrong thing.  I will say we probably had the nicest, coolest, best waitress ever! It really made you realize how many miserable people must just had their jobs because she clearly loved what she was doing! In turns of the atmosphere, it was nothing special and pretty laid back, which was about perfect for what we were looking for. They got us in and out in no time while making a great impression on us.

Starbucks had not yet occupied prime retail spots around the city, and Marty, the owner, knew everyone's name. It was THE hot spot for upscale power lunches and early cell phone adopters, embedded in a great shooing area, near the neighborhoods like Rancho Bonito, Doctor's Hill and Spanish Oaks that housed Las Vegas's venture class in the 60's and 70's. Since then Marty opened the health and juice bars in a local gym franchise, the ownership shifted twice, but the Coffee Pub's flexible and delicious menu continued. You can bring you dog in the patio and sip the delicious coffee drinks in a California traditional atmosphere. It's not old, it's gentrified. Rage against corporate coffee and keep small businesses with great spirit, like the Coffee Pub, thriving. Enjoy yourself for your delicious and gracious effort.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Las Vegas last week and I found this place on Yelp, and decided to give it a go, as it had plenty of vegetarian options and very reasonable prices. My boyfriend and I loved, LOVED the servers here. It was so cool seeing how they immediately treated us like old friends, and they treated all the patrons the same way. All of the servers were hilarious, and really really nice. We visited Coffee Pub twice and both times, I don't think we ever asked for refills on coffee or water, because they came around to give us refills constantly. They had great recommendations for food based on our personal tastes. You could tell all the customers were regulars because the servers greeted them by name and knew what they were ordering. Plus, the food was all fantastic, the coffee was great, and it was the perfect breakfast to compliment a late night in Las Vegas. If you love breakfast potatoes, you MUST try theirs. I made sure to get the potatoes both times and they were the best EVER! If only we were locals, we would be there probably every freaking day. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place!",

    "text": "While in Vegas over the weekend, I wanted to get off the strip for at least one meal. On my way out of town, my friend and I stopped at the Coffee Pub (as influenced by Dave H's review). This place is very homey. When you walk in, it doesn't feel like anything special, but the people who work here are very friendly and casual. We sat ourselves and were served quickly (which was great because we needed to get home). The coffee was pretty standard coffee....nothing special for a place named after it. My friend had the pumpkin pancakes, which were good, and I had the croissant egg sandwich sub over medium egg. Mine was very good, but very homey... as in, I could make this at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were cooked well. It was good. Service was great, the woman who works there (owns it?) with the short hair knew everyone's names that came in and was very friendly...offered to bring out a coffee to go for me, which I appreciated. I noticed she physically touched just about each one of the customers (not in a weird way...just in a friendly way). The prices were good. I would consider going back when in Vegas.",

The only boarder like negative comment I can come up with is that they really don't have a \"soup of the day\" for it is always chicken tortilla, but their soup is always amazing so it okay by me.

This last time around, I split the \"Build-your-own\" two egg breakfast with my mom. We ordered scrambled eggs, a waffle, the chicken sausage and the dish came with breakfast potatoes. The eggs and potatoes were someone average (as they tend to be), but I was very impressed with that amazing waffle. The chicken sausage was also incredibly tasty two.

Here's the low down if you want some suggestions on what to order.   Coffee--- Wow what amazing coffee service! Here's what I mean (because I'm a coffee snob). Americano was perfectly made in a nice large cup. The coffee beans was so smooth and strong! What pushed us over the top (with happiness) was our waitresses because she even offered to refill our cups with regular coffee for free! Now where do you find that kind of service nowadays? No where but here!!  Waffles--- 5/5 Very lite, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I have never had a better waffle! It was amazing (especially with my coffee)  Original Chicken Pub Sandwich--- 5/5 huge portions and just the right amount of chicken, sprouts, and cheese. Very balanced and extremely tasty!!  As you can tell we were very impressed! You don't find this kind of quality and service at many places. But when you do....you write long reviews like this! Amazing amazing amazing!

This basically means that I avoid the strip and prefer non food chain restaurants.   First off, bonus points on the adorable name. I'm not much of a drinker, but coffee is my drink of choice.   Breakfast is traditional American.  For me, the mark of a great restaurant is how good the eggs benedict are. These were pretty great. The eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was rich and creamy and everything you expect from hollandaise. The potatoes were seasoned well and perfectly crispy and soft inside.   We opted for patio seating because it was a beautiful day out in early October. Our server was a tall mustachioed Kings fan. He was attentive and even offered us a to-go cup for the road, which was considerate of him. Looking back now, I wish we had taken him up on that. The drive home took 2 hours longer than usual.   Vegas is a great foodie town, but if you're not in the mood to deal with long lines, check out the Coffee Pub.",

It comes with a good helping of a side and is under $10.    Now to the bad:  My bread fell apart when I was eating and I resorted to fork and kniving my entire meal.  And the service was very, very, very slow.  The owner was attentive but a little crazy.  She was practically running around her place non-stop for the 45 minutes we were there.  I would say if you work in the area and want to spend a nice afternoon lunch out and not deal with the strip, then Coffee Pub has a nice homey atmosphere to enjoy the afternoon.  You will wait, and it's not the cheapest out there, but you could do worse in the area.  Open only for breakfast and lunch, and not fried like the fast food alternatives - a nice change of pace.",

When my entree arrived I bit into the eggs which were smothered in cheese, cooked perfectly medium and tasted delish.

Due to being super hungry, I ordered both their stuffed French Toast and a side of Biscuits and Gravy (which was nowhere to be found on the menu, but asked the waitress for it). The lady said it was 4 piece of French toast (which was surprising to me because it only cost $1 more than a regular 3-slice French toast). But I didn't expect the amount when it came out. The French toast was basically two almost-sandwiches (choice-of-fruit and cream cheese enveloped by French toast), cut into four triangles. It was amazing!!  The biscuits and gravy side was phenomenal. I LOVE biscuits and gravy and these were honestly probably the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The biscuit was full of flavor and the gravy was absolutely delightful! (If I'm honest, I loved these more than my amazing French toast).  On of my friends got a two-egg + your choice platter and the other got one of their egg scrambled and they both said their dishes were amazing :)",

Again, it was OK, just not a traditional take on it. Also had a side of shredded lettuce that was wilted and just did not belong on a plate. Had a business meeting and asked to be seated in a quiet area. Instead, waitresses were literally yelling across the restaurant at their tables. Other tables did not seem to mind, but for us it was extremely rude, intrusive and almost impossible to hear our own conversation. Way too loud for me. I feel like this restaurant also needs a really good cleaning. We moved from one table to the next because the table was sticky. The second table had syrup or something sticky on it also. Our server did come over and clean it when we pointed out, but was just kind of gross.",

The food was alright nothing that would make us come back at all. Hollaindaise sauce was awful, the rib-eye was too fatty. My suggestion skip this place and try something else or you will feel disappointed and let down. Kudos to Our waitress though she was nice.",

I had French toast which was semi hot when I got it. Espresso was served semi hot. My girlfriend selected the lobster omelet and it was okay, but not magical as implied in other reviews.    Really an average experience with average food.",

They have an outside patio, too -- and plenty of seating inside...without ever a wait.  When I lived in Vegas, I would come here 3x per week for lunch.  It's owned by a lovely couple who set a relaxed tone to enjoy, and have hired wonderful servers.  The menu is great, expansive (= lots of choices!)...and they will accomodate any changes or special orders.  My favorites are the soft chicken tacos, roast beef melt, the chicken tortilla soup, and/or any of their omelettes (served all day, get it with their great home potatoes).  They also have fresh baked goodies (muffins/cookies), and great coffees.  It's a winner!",

After researching for over an hour of where to eat for breakfast. I settled on the Coffee Pub. It was a very short Uber ride away, less than 5 minutes. It's nestled away from the street. We had the option to eat outside. Our server Robbie was attentive along with a waitress (Loren?) who introduced herself and talked to us several times. There were a variety of coffee choices from Latte's to Expresso. No bland coffee here! My potatoe's were well seasoned and my vegetarian daughter ordered the best fruit cup filled with fresh banana's, pineapple and strawberries. The overall menu was very affordable. I strongly recommend Coffee Pub for a quiet, local non--strip experience. The waitress even recommended a place for dinner down the street, Weera Thai and we ate there that evening and had another incredible (affordable) eating experience in Vegas!",

I usually get the Veggie Omelette with Josephina cheese substituted for whatever the menu says.  Their housemade Josephina cheese is bomb dot com.

On several occasions I had to get up from the table to request coffee refills. And what's with the wooden stir sticks? Where's the metal spoon you used to give me?  The food is mediocre. Eggs Benny is acceptable but the yogurt with granola and peaches was disappointing. Canned peaches? Blech. Where am I? Shoneys? The sandwiches are fair. I hear they used to be much better with the previous ownership. Last time I was here, the esspresso machine was down and that really bummed me out. If I'm not psyched about the food, at least give me a cappucino!  The reason I keep finding myself here is that damned outdoor seating. I love sitting outdoors and not paying Strip prices to do so. So... here I am panning a place that I'll probably end up at again and kick myself for doing so.",

The owners were so polite and served us quickly. They came by often to see if we needed more iced tea and even offered to give us carry out cups with more iced tea. The sandwiches were fresh and tasty. I thought the prices were reasonable. We plan to go back again soon as the menu looks interesting for breakfast as well as appetizers and main course dishes. I like it when the owners chat with you and make you feel welcome. They appreciate your business.",

I ordered the Ruben (which was delicious), the portions was huge for the French toast and I also ordered the eggs Benedict(it was cooked prefect)  The only downside to this visit and the reason I have this place a 3 was the waitress. She seemed friendly when greeting but when she asked which sides I wanted and gave them off to me too quickly.. She talked too fast! (it was 8am on a sat and I didn't have my coffee yet:( )  I mistakenly said potato salad instead of pasta salad and she responded with a annoyingly dragged out Nooooooooooo. And corrected me. There was no other customers waiting to order at the time. I don't understand what she was in a hurry for. She clearly knew I was new to the place.   Will I go back-- Maybe.",

The interior definitely didn't make a good first impression; it's old, dim, dingy, and the chairs were a bit uncomfortable. There are a lot of options on the menu, however, there were few things that really caught my eye. Of course we had to order the famous lobster omelet with Josephina cheese, served with potato cakes. It really didn't wow me. The sauce was good, perhaps more suitable for something else, but it wasn't memorable. The potato cakes were good; fancy name for fast food-style hash browns. We also ordered the ribeye with eggs and their house potatoes. The meat was cooked nicely and the potatoes were good. Again, nothing spectacular though. The service was nice and overall experience was okay. I was expecting a little more because of the hype around their lobster breakfasts, so the mediocre meal was disappointing.",

    "text": "We decided to come here after doing a yelp search for cheapish breakfasts in vegas and were impressed by the generally good reviews and mention of a lobster omelet.  the lobster omelet was ok, nothing fabulous.   what was beyond horrid was the chorizo omelet my bf had been craving all morning. it was brought to us beyond burnt.  like so visibly wrong we were shocked they would even set it on the table.  yes, the presence of chorizo can darken the overall omelet appearance, this was not the issue. the issue was that the cook done burnt the shit out of that omelet.  my bf is of the generally never send something back and make the best of it school.  he tried dousing it in sauce to make it edible. nothing could help that sad omelet.    we didnt even get the opportunity to send it back as no one came to check on us for several several minutes.  despite seeing my empty plate and an omelet missing two bites on my bf's, the waitress said, is everything ok here? hmmm, probably not.  we explained it was not edible due to being beyond burnt. she apologized but did not offer to cook another or ask if he wanted something else.  after a few mpre minutes we asked for the check, having to flag down another server.  the chorizo omelet was not taken off the check.    I informed the waitress that as the omelet, was not only visibly burnt but inedible, that it should be removed from the check.  She then had a man come over, possibly the owner, who tried to explain to us that if may have been burned because the chorizo has to be cooked a long time. bad, bad, bad excuse, even more so as my bf used to own a bar/restaurant in the southwest and is quite aware of how chorizo needs to be cooked and that most important, it can coexist with eggs in an omelet without it being burnt beyond consumption.  if you are lookin for a great breakfast, try to the peppermill, where not only can they cook chorizo but deliver a hefty portion",

Coffee Pub is close enough to the casinos that it's easy to get to if you happen to be staying at one but far enough still that the prices aren't crazy.  I loved the vibe this place had.  Walking in I felt like I had found some secret place only locals would know about.  Being that it's in the back of an outdoor mall with no obvious signage from the street I may not be that far off.  The staff was very helpful and friendly but not in that fake way you get used to when you spend a lot of time in the casinos.  The menu had lots of great choices that made me wish it wasn't a 4 hour drive away from home so I could try them all.    I'm not normally a coffee drinker but I figured if I'm trying out a place named Coffee Pub I had to try some.  It was very good and I could see myself drinking more of it if I lived closer.  I'll be sure to eat here every time I find myself in Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm actually surprised how underrated this restaurant is.  Delicious food and great service, two of the few things I expect from a restaurant if I were to wake up early for breakfast.  Luckily, this place has both and more!!  The menu is actually quite extensive; got my water and a refill before deciding on what to order.  Had the Lobster Omelette during my recent visit since it seems to be one of the items that everyone keeps raving about.  Unfortunately, I should've gone with my gut and stuck to what I knew best.  I don't know about y'all but I'd like to see chunks of meat if I were to order something with lobster.  Instead, I got what seemed to be chopped up krabs mixed with mayonnaise which overpowered the taste of the dish.  I say go for their Benedicts.  Eggs usually come in poached just right over toasted english muffins.  Overall, Coffee Pub is a dope spot for breakfast!! I definitely recommend it over other  places in the valley.",

I order the roast beef sandwich, #13 and my boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  The bread on my sandwich was toasted to where it was crisp and buttery. The roast beef was delectable, with cheese melted on it and perfectly grilled mushrooms and onions smothered on top. It also came with au jus which was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of eggs benedict but my boyfriend said it was great and the best he could recall having. We came back today with a friend who I insisted try the roast beef dip, and she agreed that it was wonderful. My boyfriend got the Angus burger (YUM) and I got the chicken fajita wrap, which were both impeccable. Service was great once again, definitely marked as one of my go-to's when in Vegas now. Highly recommended!",

I eventually decided to grab a menu and sit at the table closest to the door, since I was waiting for my husband to meet me anyway.   I was checked on a couple of times while waiting, so I ordered a coffee. When my husband got there, we decided sandwiches looked good. He ordered the Pub Club and I got the #10 (can't remember the name). The wait wasn't long. Once we got our food, we were never checked on again. I could have used a water, but the staff were all too busy to wave down.  The club was huge, double-stacked, and toasted so it hurt your mouth a little. But it had good flavor. The #10 had turkey, avocado, sprouts, and tomato on wheat. The turkey portion was very generous and the bread was good, but it could have used some mustard. The side pickle was probably my favorite part- it reminded me of the pickles at a delicatessen.   All in all, $25 for lunch wasn't bad.",

I'm a creature of habit so I have a selection of menu items I would never stray from: Chicken Egg White Omelet (with choice of chips, macaroni salad or fruit + choice of toast), Lobster Omelet, The Redondo (BLAT + turkey breast, Swiss cheese on sourdough bread) and, The Palm Springs (roast beef, avocado, cheddar, tomato and lettuce on wheat). For smoothies, I like: Strawberry Bear (strawberries, banana and non-dairy gelato) and Chai This (chai, protein powder, banana and soy milk). Smoothies that don't make my stomach hurt, yay!

    "text": "Great little hidden gem!! Thank you yelpers for directing us to another great local find.  I visit Vegas quite a bit, and try not to eat on the Strip if possible.  The Strip is a \"rip\" and the only benefit of eating at the Strip is I can use my comp points for mediocre, overpriced food.  Finding a mom-and-pop place like Coffee Pub makes the trip more enjoyable.  Its nice to just walk away from the clangs of the slots or the smoke filled casinos.  This Coffee Pub is tucked away in a desolate strip mall, completely on the opposite side from the other merchants.  Its next to an Embassy banquet type place, which I mistook for the Embassy Suites Hotel (its not!).  Its across from the Nevada Bank if that helps.  The place is small, holds maybe 50-80 people, cozy, with a few big table for groups.  There's outside tables for the pets (I guess?) or maybe for the smokers, though I am not sure of the Nevada laws regarding smoking near an eating establishment.  Prices are reasonable, and plenty to choose from for Breakfast/ Brunch/ Lunch.  Originally I was going to get breakfast but the sandwiches sounded so yummy, I decided to have that instead. I thought I ordered the San Diegan, but realized it was the Redondo, the turkey, bacon, avocado on sourdough.  It came with melted cheese, but I held off on the cheese. It comes with fruit, salad or chips.  Stephen had the huevos ranchero, and he said it had a good kick to it.    I'd come back! Great little place, and the staff does their best to serve.",

With so much positive reviews and good food, I believe they can do better than me giving them 3 stars. We came on a Saturday morning. Around 11 for brunch. We sat on their patio since it was such a beautiful day. For one, their tables are tiny and everything they served were on large plates. We didn't have room for all our plates and we had to put some on our laps. Yes, on our laps. They saw us and didn't offer to move us to give us a bigger space or anything. Our order took nearly an hour to come out. Mind you, they were not busy at all! I ordered their steak and eggs and the steak was thin and dry. I honestly think their bacon was the best thing I ate here.",

We ate our food and waited for a while but eventually had to get up and go to the front to pay for our food. The owner has no idea how to serve so why the hell is he even trying to do so?

There are a lot of pictures of celebrities on the wall, so must be a popular place.  We got the iced coffee because summer in Vegas means 115 degrees outside and we all ordered variations of eggs benedict. Mine was the smoked salmon benedict. It comes with 2 sets of (obviously) smoked salmon, with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce on top a grilled english muffin. It also comes with your side of potatoes. I got hash browns - pretty ok.  The smoked salmon benedict was amazing, but I also had a taste of someone's southern benedict. It had sausage gravy instead of hollandaise. I think both were very good dishes.  I would come back again for brunch if I was in the area or someone wanted a hole in the wall type that's non-strip.",

Patio dining looking out over a quiet parking lot, extensive menu, great food. I dig everything about this place except the fact that it closes at 3pm. Who the hell wants to weigh themselves down with a ginormous meal that early in the day???  Still, highly recommended. If looking for a good breakfast spot on the West side, it's a toss-up between this place, the Omelet House, and the Egg &I. The food at all 3 is of equal excellence, but Coffee Pub has the edge because you can dine al fresco, and the view/atmo is better than that of the Egg &I's patio.",

We purchased breakfast and were even able to purchase food for the road. Our waitress Lauren was so personable and knowledgable. She was able to provide us with great suggestions on food to take on the road and even refilled all of our water bottles. A very positive experience!!!",

Yelpers suggested the Lobster Omelette, so my wife was thrilled to try it. It was delicious with good amounts of lobster. I had the Lobster melt and was absolutely satisfied. The bread, soft toasted sourdough, the avocado, tomato really lent its flavor to the Lobster. I added a dash of hot sauce since I favor spicy food.  The server who took care of us, very short hair, green-hazel eyes. She was just down to earth and made sure our first time was worth it. Well it definitely was, we will be back for more. You can eat inside or out, try it out over them big buffetts that aren't all that anyways.",

It's definitely a hidden gem and I probably wouldn't ever have known about it if it weren't for my bad habit of trying to find shortcuts in this city. The place has a very \"homey\" feel and actually reminds me of being in Lake Tahoe or some place in the mountains. I dined here with Don earlier today and ordered a 1/2 sandwich combo with The Palm Springs Sandwich, roasted tomato soup, and coleslaw ($8.95). Don ordered the Ribeye Steak and Eggs ($12.95). While waiting for our orders, we studied on our laptops because they have free wifi, woohoo. The food came out pretty fast. The soup was pretty salty, so I didn't care for it very much at all, but the sandwich tasted so fresh. I don't normally order anything with roast beef in it, but the combination of roast beef with avocado was very tempting.   While we ate, I couldn't help but notice that there were a lot of regulars in the house. The employees would call people by their names and already have their usual orders memorized (it's always a good sign when people come back that many times). They were also surprisingly busy. I say \"surprisingly\" because I've never heard of this place before or even seen it. They had a lot of people dining out on the patio, inside, and calling in orders.   I will be back here very soon, especially since it's not too far from CSN and it's right by the freeway.   Tips: -Check out the menu online before coming in if you have the chance because they have A LOT of items. I saw about 20 different sandwiches, pastas, burgers, breakfast items, appetizers, specialties, etc.",

My girlfriend got an omelette and said the eggs were so over cooked they had the consistency of a scaly lizard. The vegetables in the omelette were sparse over all it was not a pleasant eating experience. I gave it two stars because the coffee and tea was really good.

The food, however, was fairly mediocre. Mine was a simple breakfast of eggs, bacon, fruit, and toast. And everything was fine. Solid. But not the great quality of remembered or the delicate preparation I was hoping for.    If I am hungry and in the area, I'd come  back.

The staff were the friendliest I've ever experienced anywhere. Happy, fun, nice, and informative. And the food is affordable and tasty. Reckon my bill came to like $12.

We tend to stay away during the hot summer months as the air conditioning can be marginal and I like it cold.  Friends are usually the ones to suggest meeting up here, but then again that is rarely.

It was hard to choose what to order, I was torn between the croissant Benedict and the croissant  breakfast sandwich, our waitress suggested the sandwich with a side of hollandaise, which was perfect! The portions are generous, I was only able to eat half of my sandwich and a few potatoes. My husband got the peach stuffed french toast, he liked that it wasn't too sweet, which they typically tend to be. I also got the iced white mocha, I highly recommend.

The service was great, I was seated immediately and never ran low on water or coffee. I walked out stuffed and happy and only ended up paying $20 for two people.   Stuffed French toast: 4/5 the French toast was good. The cream cheese was a little overwhelming and in some bites it was hard to detect the strawberries and bananas.   Eggs, potatoes, bacon & pancakes: 5/5 I ordered scrambled eggs and they were fluffy, buttery and contained good flavor. The bacon was cooked to perfection and the pancakes were huge and fluffy.

Present day, we're older, more particular with what we want, etc. Thank goodness for Yelp! I bookmarked Coffee Pub prior to our visiting Vegas based on the positive reviews I read.   We were looking for a quality brunch, with easy parking, excellent customer service, and kind on our wallet. I am so glad I can join the majority and vouch that Coffee Pub is indeed all that. Their menu is extensive. There was so much to review and consider! This is where Alexis (our hostess) stepped in. She asked what we normally like to eat for breakfast. From there she recommended a few items for us to consider. She was kind and genuine. A few minutes later, our waiter, Robert, came to take our order.  Here's what we ordered:  Coffee: Nice, hot, and smooth! To make it even better, Robert, came by often to refill our cups with more coffee. It's a downer when we have to request for more coffee. Robert didn't let that happen. He was attentive throughout our time there.  Waffles: I've tasted stale waffles before and thankfully this was not the case. Coffee Pub's waffles was AMAZING! It was hot, fresh, and light. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.   My son ordered the Chicken Egg White Omelette. His meal came with their House Potatoes and Toast.  My husband and I each ordered the Build Your Own Breakfast. He had Scrambled Eggs, Ham Steak, House Potaotes, and French Toast. I had Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, House Potaotes, and Waffle.  As you can tell we were  impressed! The food was scrumptious and the customer service was outstanding!  If we lived in Las Vegas, we'd be regular customers. Thank you to the Coffee Pub team! Keep up the amazing work!",

It reminds me of some of the more enjoyable coffee shops/cafes that I've been to in other cities. A lot of folks there seem to be regulars, and the employees were all very nice and accommodating. That makes it a place I would love to go back to regularly.  Of course, good food helps. The lobster omelet was good, worth getting. At 12.95 it is reasonable in size and quality, certainly not overpriced.  There are a lot of seats, inside and out. They must've gotten a good deal long ago because it is surprising they are able to maintain such a big space. Great news for customers.",

The pastrami sandwich is the best I've had anywhere and I've eaten plenty of pastrami sandwiches in my lifetime.  My kids loved their turkey sandwiches and the flavors were incredible.  Breakfast potatoes delicious.  Chicken quesadilla was filled to overflowing with quality chicken breast.  We LOVE the food here.

The food is above average and it was not crowded at 9 am on Saturday morning, the wait staff is friendly. The patio looked nice for a group if it was warmer.   Unfortunately, It took forever to get our food well over 30 minutes from order to table and the tables were super small cafe types so difficult with kids(they did have a high chair though)  and lots of breakfast plates. I had the omelette with cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes and shallots and it was fantastic, the pub potatoes which were recommended were under cooked- the  hash browns my son had were much better. French Toast was good but the hot chocolate and coffee were nothing exciting. Straight up farmers brothers and carnation.",

We've lived here for a decade and are totally kicking ourselves for not finding this place earlier. it is very close to Palace Station, yet it feels off the beaten path. There's comfortable outdoor seating, and the indoor seating is cozy. The inside is a trip because the decor is straight out of the 80's, but I hope they never change a thing-so don't judge! It's clean and friendly! It's a total locals' cafe, but from the first time we went, the wait staff made us feel like we came all the time.   The food is delicious, and as breakfast food, I think it's comparable to my other favorite  breakfast places, such as Egg Works and The Omelet House. It's just darn good food. A few times that I've been in the waitress offered suggestions when i couldn't decide--a modification to the menu items even! Most places are not really anxious to have patrons \"have it their way\"--let alone suggesting it!  The coffee is strong like my husband and I like it, and the portions of the food always make us promise that next time we'll share, but we never do. Too many good things!",

Came with a group of 5 on Easter Sunday, seated right away which was nice considering all of the other places in town had hour wait times. Ordered a short stack pancakes and potatoes. Now let me tell you, these pancakes aren't so good without syrup. HOWEVER, this magical syrup will make anything taste like gold. Potatoes were greasy (not at all a bad thing for me, I am a grease queen), but some were not fully cooked. Still overall delicious & worth a try!! Will be coming back to try other menu items.",

We ordered their mind blowing breakfast burrito along with two scrambled eggs with sausage patties, potatoes and their famous pancakes.  You can literally taste the freshness of their ingredients.  I also can't say enough about their coffee.  It had the right amount of aroma, body and flavor.   The entire breakfast was so delicious that we ordered the lobster melt and the Redondo sandwich to go for lunch in case we got hungry on the long drive.  They tasted great even later in the day.  Thank you Coffee Pub!!!",

    "text": "We went fishing for the lobster omelette. It is not just the stuff of legends. It is the real deal, and it was my husband's catch of the day. I am not a lobster lover, so I ordered a scramble with broccoli and feta. My husband says he probably wouldn't order the omelet again because it is covered in a rich cheese and chile sauce, and creamy isn't one of his favorite adjectives. However, there were definitely plenty of chunks of lobster. My scramble was solid thanks to a healthy helping of super fresh broccoli. And, we both enjoyed potato cakes, basically a McDonald's hashbrown.   In addition to a large breakfast and lunch menu featuring staples like omelets and sandwiches and some creative twists, aka lobster, the Coffee Pub also has an extensive coffee menu. My latte was one of the better executions I have had at a full service breakfast restaurant.   During the weekdays, the Pub is supposedly the hang of the major movers and shakers of Las Vegas, people like the mayor, and the walls are covered with signed photos of interesting past customers. It is almost like a 70s hall of fame. Even Larry Wilcox is featured! The vibe is that of a homey 70s kitchen, very woody. They also have a patio and complimentary WiFi. The atmosphere definitely contributes to a positive experience, and the service is friendly.  Hey, if it is good enough for Mr. Wilcox, it's good enough for me!",

It is an incredibly convenient place to meet for lunch or breakfast, and they have good pastries. Always a good sandwich, but I would not recommend anything grilled.  Still, a patio lunch in Vegas is always a good thing, and they do have a nice patio to meet for a quick coffee and croissant!!",

    "text": "Another lunch outing with the fiance.  This time at Coffee Pub Restaurant. We ate outside because it was a nice day and the atmosphere was nice. The restaurant seemed clean and had its own style.   I ordered the Pub Dip (French Dip basically). It came with roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and onions, with melted mozzarella cheese. It was excellent! The au jus was flavorful and the sandwich itself was too. I was definitely wanting more afterward.   The fiance got breakfast croissant and it came with diced potatoes. I didn't have a chance to try the sandwich but I did try the potatoes because they looked awesome. They were just ok unfortunately. The were cooked perfectly but had zero seasoning. The fiance said the same of the sandwich. Having not tried it, I can't really make an accurate assessment of it.   All in all, I would like to come back to try other things. She would too, but didn't have a great first impression. I'm still wanting more of the Pub Dip.",

It had a small-town, down-to-earth feel, the waitresses smiled, greeted, helped, and paid attention to everyone who walked through the door. They had some seemingly odd sandwiches on the menu and I was inclined to try the Coronado. That consisted of turkey, raisins, sesames seeds, cranberry sauce, and cream cheese on pumperknickel bread!  It was an odd combination but it was fantastic! Service and food was great, the only complaint would be they need to have better seating areas and get the a/c checked - it was 100+ outside but was very very warm inside the restaurant.",

Coffee Pub had good reviews and despite it being very close to the Strip, we decided to give it a shot. We were very pleasantly treated by a waitress whose name I can't recall but was definitely in the right profession. She swooped by and got our coffee and breakfast orders, cooed over our dog, managed several other tables, and made some very comfortable, friendly, and raunchy small talk in between. Even with her other tables, she seemed to be very attentive and picked up on their needs before they had a chance to flag her down.   We sat outdoors so we could have our dog-son Arlo with us while we ate. I got a vegetarian breakfast scramble and she got the Hungry Farmer (or something like that) Omelette without the meat. The home fries were amazing, slightly seasoned, and crisped to a satisfyingly crunchy level. The scramble and toast were good but not outstanding, and the iced coffee I had was bold but not so flavorful. No matter, the meal was cheap, filling, and not a hassle to turn it into a vegetarian breakfast as is sometimes the case. I would definitely return on another trip through LV. I also enjoyed the waitress' demeanor and energy and hope she finds her happiness in food service or elsewhere. As a food service survivor, It's always nice to run across people who wait tables and (at least seemingly) don't despise it.",

I hate to write a review with such a low rating because they were so nice.  Service is the only reason that I did not give this place 1 star.  The food was absolutely horrible.  We're  actually feeling a little sick.    The fact that the place was a bit run down didn't deter  us since it's been around for a long time and it's located almost across from Palace Station  (old section of LV).  What did give us a moment of pause was that the place was empty on a Sunday during brunch hours.  That's rare in Vegas unless there's an issue.   For beverages we ordered coffee and iced tea.  The first cup of coffee was good.  The second tasted like the burnt bottom of the pot.  The tea was cloudy and tasted dirty.   For food we ordered the California Eggs Benedict $9.75, and the Ribeye & eggs $12.95 (plus $.75 for cream cheese to spread on the bagel and $.60 for house made salsa she told me I should try on my eggs).  Everything about the Benedict tasted old.  The tomato had a mealy texture, the eggs were rubbery, the hollandaise was incredibly bland and gelatinous.    The Ribeye meal was a disaster.  The steak was way over done, mostly fat & gristle, and lacked any kind of flavor (steak or seasoning).  The scrambled eggs were...gross is the only word I can think of right now.  The house made salsa was good, but didn't save the eggs.  The side of fruit (pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew) was good (they accidentally brought potatoes, but a fruit cup followed quickly after I mentioned it) and the bagel (plain, no choices) was okay.  Tasted store bought.  Unfortunately, we would not return.",

Took Our order - kids were jumping on the pancakes, while my husband and I tried the omelette and oatmeal. Everything was really good! Even my latte was great. Awesome spot for breakfast or lunch!",

I had hashbrowns with two eggs over easy half of a waffle and we had sausage as well as a half of biscuit and gravy each. The waffle was amazing! Best I have ever had! Over easy eggs cooked as order and hashbrowns were good. The biscuits were the old flower kind that my grandma made. Not real tall and fluffy but very tasty. The gravy was so so probably the least impressive aspect of the breakfast but definitely a three out of five. The server had a great personality but she sometimes lost track of checking in on us. That may have been because she had tables outside as well as in.",

    "text": "Coffee Pub is still around?? I know I was surprised too. I used to be a regular at this little cafe' off West Sahara. I knew the owners and the food here was pretty hard to beat. I have been back here twice now and it just isn't the same anymore.  The first time I came, I had my old favorite sandwich, the Floor Show which is just turkey and avocado. You can't really can't go wrong with this simple sandwich and it was good. I came back again last Friday and decided to get a little more adventurous. I decided to order the Huevos Rancheros. This is one of my favorite breakfast dishes and I like to try them out when I see them on a menu. Our server informed me that \"it is the best dish on the menu\" so I got excited! She even went as far as to tell me that she comes in on her days off just to have this dish so my friend decided to order the same dish.  Well..........our orders arrived and at first look, the dish looked really good but then I tasted it and UH OH! It was a huge disappointment. First of all, they used flour tortillas which I prefer corn and I am used to the dish being soaked in salsa. There was little to no salsa on this dish but they did pile on the cheese. The beans were totally separated from the dish which I found odd and they tasted like they had been around a while. The flavors were dull and tasteless but I managed to get it down.   They say \"sometimes you can never go back\" and that would be the case for this place. The old Coffee Pub was amazing.  The food was always fresh and the presentation was always spot on. Three stars is all I can muster up. These stars are for the service not the food.",

As I entered into the place I was greeted by a pleasant waitress, and I was seated right away. The waitress was super friendly and the place was really laid back which I love. Since the weather was beautiful I decided to sit outside on the patio.   This was about 10am in the morning  therefore  I decided to order the bagel and Lox, for those of you who aren't familiar with a Lox bagel, it mostly a bagel with cream cheese and salmon. For for a drink I had an orange juice.  The food was delivered in a timely manner, and the portion was pretty huge, packed with lots of salmon! And the orange juice was good as well, it wasn't your typical orange juice from a cheap box, at least that's what i tasted.. :)  Another item I highly suggest trying is the boca burger with alfalfas, a favorite lunch dish i normally order when I am here..  Overall experience, I love this place! I have been coming here since 2003 and im glad this place is doing good!",

    "text": "While visiting Vegas we like to get off the strip and try new places. This popped up as a breakfast option and its not far from the SLS where we are staying.   The ambiance is clean and country quirky. We felt comfortable.   It took about 5 min to be acknowledged. I get annoyed when you aren't even acknowledged. No, \"hi, be right with you.\" No, \"good morning.\" Maybe I'm getting old and have high expectations. The two tables who sat down several minutes after us had drinks and had ordered before we even talked to a person. Oh well I digress.   The iced tea is like a tropical tea. It was yum.   After we ordered it took far too long to get our food. The two other tables, who sat after us, were finishing eating.   When our food came the person had to come back three times. Each of these times she came with the wrong meal. Pancakes? No. Croissant Benedict? Yes, but this is a croissant sandwich. Now the right meal comes. Another situation. My husband ordered the potato cakes as a side to his burrito. He has two McDonalds looking hash browns on his plate. She also places a plate with two more McDonald's looking hash browns down. I say, \"oh, we asked for the potato cakes.\" She says this is the correct item. She leaves. Two minutes later after we salt and start picking at them she comes back and takes the two in the middle away. It was all just weird. I totally think that someone got our salted \"potato cakes\" because she wanted us to take the orange that we placed on the plate off. Oh, and PS the \"potato cakes\", of you haven't gathered yet, are not the type that come with sour cream and apple sauce. They are like McDonald's hash browns.  Overall the food was average. So, our hunt for the best breakfast in town continues.",

The smoked salmon itself was delicious, but the hollandaise sauce was kind of sour, like there was vinegar in it? Or hopefully it didn't go bad. I tried to push as much of it off the food as I could. The hash brown pancakes sounded great, but it wasn't really anything special and was just really crispy. If I come here again, I think I'll try a sandwich or regular pancakes.",

I flagged down  someone from the kitchen to get coffee refills and then again to get our check. The guy whom I asked for the check came over and tried to take our order until we explained that we had eaten and our waiter disappeared which didn't seem to elicit any response.    We paid the check as our waiter wandered back to the restaurant. He did a double take and I saw a dimly lit lightbulb flicker on when he appeared to remember that he abandoned us. He offered us a coffee to go in a sad attempt to do his job. We kindly declined and left. There is a lot of decent food in this town, a shortage of decent servers though.",

Its just the right amount of brooding. Our waitress hit me pretty hard w the menus in the mouth and yet still we had a great time. It was our baby's 1st birthday breakfast and she had fun too. They offered her banana and the coffee was really good. We ordered huevos racheros and french toast. Both were cooked perfect and slightly unique. Id most likely come back again. So good.",

The staff was friendly, energetic, and invested in their customers. They knew people by name and would talk to them about the latest happenings. There was a female server with short hair who was particularly energetic and created a fun atmosphere. My husband had received bacon on his plate, instead of the sausage that he had ordered. He didn't say anything about it, but she caught it right away and he said it was no big deal, but she said \"I know, but it is a big deal to me\". I thought that was the perfect example of exemplary customer service! The food itself was very good and the prices were reasonable. I particularly loved the pub potatoes! They were perfectly seasoned and had a perfect crisp on them...they were...perfect! I will be coming back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "I picked the Coffee Pub to meet with my friend and her daughter passing through Vegas. It was the perfect meeting place because it is very close to the west side of the I-15 freeway but not on the Strip, very easy to get to and had such great reviews here on yelp. It's in a creatively designed business plaza and isn't really very visible from the street although they do have a sign, but it's not huge. Another yelper said it was right across from the Bank of Nevada and that was a great help. It's also really close to Palace Station and is actually between that and In and Out on the In and Out side of the street.  I was greeted with a smile as I was walking in by a waitress serving people on the shaded patio who had their doggie with them, so it's dog friendly. They have a lot of the freebee Vegas magazines outside should you want to pick one or two up.  It was around 9:45 on a Sunday morning and there were only a few tables of diners at that time. By the time we left, a little after 11:00 am, things were fairly bustling with diners, so going early got me my pick of a great table in the corner with lots of light from the windows surrounding it.  I ordered the half stack of pumpkin pancakes topped with whipped cream, maple syrup and pecans. It was delicious and I could only eat about half of it. I'd say the two pancakes were about 8\" in diameter and took up most of the whole plate. The regular stack is only a little bit more money and would be great to split if you'd like to do that. My friend and her daughter both ordered egg dishes which looked wonderful and they both said theirs were really good too. I don't doubt it. They looked good and their portions were large as well. Oh, and they have gluten-free bread for those who don't eat gluten.  The only one little thing that wasn't perfect was the coffee. I am very finicky about my coffee so I asked the waitress what kind they served and she said \"Farmer Brothers and it is delicious\". I found it to be too strong even loaded up with sugar and what was probably half and half. They also have a soy milk option.  Next time I would try a cappuccino or something along those lines.  All in all, I was very happy I chose the Coffee Pub. There are surprisingly few restaurants near the Strip that I could find where they're open on Sunday, you can have regular good old American food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, has a nice ambiance and good service as well. Our bill was only $33 for 3 breakfasts.  I highly recommend it!",

We were instantly greeted and sat, but it took about 5 minutes before a waitress came over. The place wasn't busy at all. Our drinks came out quickly and their iced coffee and espresso based drinks are amazing. Unfortunately, everything else was lackluster.  I ordered the Pub Dip, the bread was over toasted and the beef was cooked to the point where it has a rubbery, bad clam texture. My sister ordered the huevos rancheros which was eggs covered in salsa and crusty re-fried beans.My mom's eggs were overdone, her potatoes burnt, but the sausage patties were okay.  The food here was on par with a low grade buffet. Nothing tasted fresh.  The food took forever to come out and the service was just blah. I won't be headed back to the Coffee Pub no matter how great their coffee is.",

Portion of meat was large but the meat itself lacked flavor, and sandwiches were dry without any condiments.    Would have asked for mustard, but service is incredibly lacking. There were maybe four employees running around but  customers are waiting for checks, condiments, and silverware longer than they're eating. Disorganized and impersonal, lack of consistency in both service and food quality.",

We were originally looking for just a coffee place but the neighboring coffee , tea , or me ? place happened to be closed and came across this on yelp.   When you walk in its more like a diner rather than a coffee shop that I had expected . They have a nice area on the patio to eat as well as two rooms inside filled with old pictures , reminiscent of it's past. You can pick your own seats as well. My seat seemed as if it was going to break which was a little uncomfortable so I switched seats with a table near by . I found that the interior part of the restaurant was uncomfortable so we opted for the patio. The patio area is a nice shaded area.   I got the frozen white chocolate mocha frappe and the salmon lox. Delicious ! They were both very good and the waitress even gave me a few more capers cause I'm a caper freak. Anywho , service was awesome and you can tell that everyone that works there cares about their customers. A few regulars came in and they greeted them welcomingly asking them how they've been etc . Was nice to see this and they even treated me like I've been going there along time .   It's cute if you want a nice low key breakfast dinner not so good as a coffee place , but I know now ! I'll be back , maybe I'll be a regular too .",

The smoothie we tried was delicious and balanced (not like drinking a cup of syrup). Belgian waffle is solid as well, topped with fresh strawberries, with syrup,  butter and whipped cream on the side so it doesn't go soggy. No dissapointments here, other than my stomach is too small to eat all of the things. Lauren, our server gave off the whole cool aunt kinda vibe. There is a pretty extensive decently priced menu off strip if you want to get away from the drunkards and strip clubs.",

If all waiters/waitresses/bartenders... hell, people in general -- were as friendly and at ease in their profession, there would be no need for Yelp.  That being said, I finally pulled myself away from the Eggs Benedict, and ordered the Huevos Rancheros; they were quite tasty. When the plate arrived, I didn't think I'd be able to eat them all. I proved myself wrong. I was going to order the hash browns as my side, but Lauren talked me into the pub-style potatoes (I think that's what they were called), and those are my new tip for the place; they were amazingly flavorful.   Definitely my go-to breakfast place when I'm visiting Las Vegas!  (Lauren, if you're reading this, Go Falcons! :))",

I am so glad that my family found this little breakfast pub. This is some of the best breakfast I ever had!   Everything we ordered was seriously so great. We had the banana and strawberry stuffed french toast and all I can say is WOW! I never had stuffed french toast before and I like how the flavors were subtle. It wasn't too sweet and the fruits were fresh. I also got an over easy egg and upgraded to the chicken apple sausage. The quality of the sausages were great and tasty too! The bacon here is crunchy and thick! The egg benedict also had a nice hollandaise sauce. I also wanted to talk about how good the hash browns are! I loved how perfect the crispy texture was. I also liked the unsweetened mango iced tea. It was very refreshing! I'm telling you everything here was so delicious!  The only downside to this place is that it's somewhat hidden and you have to actually go into the plaza to find it. The inside of the restaurant is a bit dark and the seats and tables are not so comfortable. Other than that, food and service is on point! If you're around the area it's right across the street from the Palace Station.",

The eggs benedict is always yummy, I enjoy the french toast, pancakes are nice and big. I like the pub potatoes and always opt for that with my order. Service is always friendly and fast. Sometimes I get the chai this smoothie and that's pretty good too. I don't drink coffee, so I can't really speak on that.  As with most breakfast spots, it can get a bit busy on the weekends but I've rarely had to wait more than 10 mins or so. There is a small patio area to sit out on when the weather permits.  This is a great alternative to Egg and I (which I feel isn't that great anyway) and Omelette House.",

If not to see and be entertained by the owner and the waitress, then it'd be for the affordable good food. I had the chicken soft tacos, by the way. I highly recommend them. They hit all of your needed food groups and were very satisfying.   Service was really what got me as fan. They're so personable and affable here that a conversation with them can wake you up better than the coffee they serve. That's not saying they serve bad coffee either.   Just check the place out. You'll like it. I'm sure.",

    "text": "Discovered this location on Yelp due to its high star rating. Unfortunately, this location really disappointed me... From the start our waitress Anna was horrendous. Upon taking our order, I tipped over my drink that splashed a little on the table. I asked her for napkins, to which she provided and finished taking my order and walked off.. she didn't even finish taking my husbands order who still had the menu in his hands. Then upon attempting to get her attention, she was nowhere to be found. My husband has to get up to look for her so that she could come to our table and finish taking his order. To which she did, she then messed up our beverage orders..  Once our food was brought out, the male who served our food was great! We got our side of bacon, which was dry and hard. We didn't even finish eating it. Our waitress, only stopped by BRIEFLY to ask if we were ok. I was already annoyed, we had several empty plates around the table, to which she didn't collect, she just walked off. She only came to our table to take our orders, finish taking our orders and one more time. Aside from that she was NOWHERE to be seen.. horrible service. I've never been so annoyed in my life! The restaurant wasn't even busy. As for the food, it was decent, Denny's has better service and food than here. We had the stuffed French toast, it was ok, nothing wow.  Hence, as a warning, visit somewhere else. My husband and I Left with a bad taste in our mouth from the service and food.",

As we sat down, we were offered drinks and the moment we got our drinks we were asked if we needed a minute..as it was our first time, we did need a few minutes. Literally 30 seconds later, our server comes back and asks if we're ready...not yet. We literally looked at only the first page of the menu. Once we figured out what we wanted to order, we waited 15 minutes before I flagged down a different server. After putting our order in, food came out in a timely fashion and it was actually delicious! But again...no server around to see how everything was or to refill our drinks. We flagged one down for the check and even that took forever and a day. This place definitely has potential. Better service will get them a better rating.",

I like the fact that they offer fresh fruit as a side, so I ordered it with my sandwich. This place doesn't feel like a diner, but they offer some of the food items that you'd typically find in a diner. This is place is worth trying if you're looking for something outside of the \"strip\"",

    "text": "I'm writing about an incident that happened before I started yelping because as someone who used to frequent coffee pub, I have not returned since. Coffee pub was hands down my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas and my favorite staff. I used to live near by so I would order delivery at least once or twice a week. The delivery driver was so fast and nice and eventually knew my order by heart. My go-to's were either bagels and lox or a Sandwhich. Since I moved from the area, any time I was on that side of town, I would stop in or order for pick up. The last time I went in for pick up, it was a warm day so I was wearing shorts and a top. As I went in to pick up, there was a bit of a wait. One of the men working in the back of house saw me and after he got done looking me up and down, he went and got the rest of the back of house staff and they all came out and were gawking at me until I felt uncomfortable enough to move. They moved too to get a better view and I asked them to stop. One of the servers asked me if everything was okay and I told her I felt extremely uncomfortable. She was nice enough to tell them to stop and get back to work. They all went back in the kitchen, laughing, and continued peeking out at me until I left. This was quite unfortunate because I miss the coffee pub but don't find it worth it to return to feel as uncomfortable as I did that day. I still recommend coffee pub to people, just advise females to dress conservatively, even in 100+ degree weather.",

We rolled in as they opened at 7:00am, just as what appeared to be the gardner was rolling up the extension cord from his leaf blower. He told us we could sit anywhere. We opted for outside seating, as the September morning weather was cooperating.   Drink orders were slow, as was the service in general. The food was delivered by, none other than, the \"gardner.\" A jack of all trades it would seem. The eggs, hash browns and sausage were all very good. The pancakes, on the other hand, were not. They were chewy and it seemed as though they must have been done before the rest of the meal and then reheated. The coffee was decent and the atmosphere had a cool coffee shop flare to it.   The slow service and chewy hot cakes prevent a four star rating. There is better food and better coffee elsewhere, but it's worth a trip just for the sake of saying you've been there.",

If you want a local hometown cafe feel, welcome.  The walls are decorated with local celebrities, home town hero's, even the local news team and statesmen, all autographed.  The staff was friendly and the men's room was clean.   Perhaps they were understaffed but my order was slightly wrong. Not a big deal but they forgot my orange juice, twice. Like I said, not a big enough deal to drop a Star. 3 employees got food and drinks for about 16 customers will little to no wait.  The prices were fair, they provide free Wi-fi and have a covered open-air porch if the weather is nice.  I had the Ribeye Steak and eggs.  The Ribeye was fatty for my personal preference but I don't rate on my personal preferences. Eggs - were - perfect. Anyone that cooks knows how hard it is to make a perfect sunny side up.  All and all, I will not only come back, I'll bring friends.",

The inside atmosphere is so-so, looking mostly like an outdated pub but with kids' coloring pages in the wall which felt very cluttered. The menu was giant. I hope in the future they can make the breakfast and lunch menu separate. We ordered the works omelet and a make your own breakfast. Everything was delicious, perfect sized portions. Iced Coffee Pub brew was really great with refills that kept coming. However, we did feel quite uncomfortable with the servers. One waitress was working very hard for her customers, but her actions were at times very unprofessional. Her shirt wasn't long enough, she was using profanity at a customer, and she sat on a table and put her feet up on the chairs. I understand she wants to make her customers feel comfortable, but with a few of the flaws here, minus the delicious food, it seems like something we would see Gordon Ramsey address on Kitchen Nightmares haha.",

I had my own version of a Denver omelet and it was very good. In fact everything was so good we decided to order our lunch to take for later. We work for an airline so they packed every thing special for us. Our waitress Lauren doesn't have an inside voice but she's a really good waitress - helpful and very up on all items on the menu - and there's a lot of them. My thanks to her and Kyle the easy going owner. The coffee pub is definitely a winner. If your staying at the Palace Station get out and try this place especially you airline people.

I feel like I'm at home when I'm here. It is off the beaten path so it is rarely crowded when I come...but it should be because it is that good!",

Service was a bit slow especially given that there were never more than 3 tables occupied outside. Overall this is a better breakfast choice than the overcrowded casino all you can eat buffet.",

Food portions were large, perfect for sharing. Our server was always smiling and went above and beyond. She even offered coffee to go. Will be back when we are in Vegas. Love these small mom and pop places!",

Their positive attitudes showed they enjoyed working there and were great to the locals and tourists getting breakfast. We had a basic breakfast of eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage/bacon and coffee. It was reasonably priced and taste good. Great spot for a tasty meal with good service.",
