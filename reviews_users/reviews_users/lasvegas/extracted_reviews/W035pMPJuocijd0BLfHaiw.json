Showed up at 11 pm to the bar and were attended by Sarah behind the bar. She was a great bartender and her personality was fantastic. We tried out the food here, also great, the music was blasting with good music we even got to see live music too. Wish we could have used the patio but it was just a bit to cold. Maybe next time if we show up earlier we will try it. I hate to write such a great review bc I know this place will be getting packed as people her about it more. All the best of luck to World of Beers.",

    "text": "Yesterday was a busy night, and my husband and I went to three different restaurants with insane waits before I said, \"Have you heard of that World of Beer place? Let's go check it out!\"   This turned out to be a great decision. We had an amazing experience from top to bottom. The food was delicious. We had the German Pretzel, with beer cheese and stone mustard sauces that were delicious. I had the Steak Fries, cooked perfectly. My husband had amazing, GIANT Korean spiced wings that were spicy and well seasoned. The beer was cold and tasty, with the insane selection they promise you from the second you walk into the door. The cooler special was awesome, so we spent some time in Great Britain for a great price before we moved to some microbrews (the Peanut Butter stout I had was one of the best stouts I ever drank).   But the service was honestly the best part of the night. My husband is in the industry and even though we live in the hospitality capital of the world, we get a lot of lackluster service. That was not the case here. Our server, Taylor, was wonderful from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. She was fun, incredibly knowledgeable, and very attentive. Our glasses were never empty! She helped us navigate the menu and provided great suggestions for both good and drink. Every moment we interacted with her, we were so impressed. Thank you for facilitating a wonderful date night, Taylor!  We're definitely coming back with family because the food is really fantastic and we obviously need to try all the beers, but we're pretty spoiled now. We'll only ever want to sit in Taylor's section!",

They use Cali Creamin and infuse it with fruits/dates/spices for a new concoction daily which is smooth and flavorful and on your first visit you can get a free local beer (although I hear this promotion will end soon)   Chicken wings are flavorful, tator tots great, and the German Pretzel is a monster of an appetizer lol.  Wasn't too impressed with Calamari but hey they can't all be winners right.   My favorite meal was the Hangover skillet everything you need/want in a breakfast including BACON!!

We shared & thought both were excellent.   Service was quick, friendly & efficient. Gentleman, who we confirmed was the owner, was hands on backing the wait staff.  I would have to compliment the owner for the restaurants hip atmosphere & menu. Also for his ability to hire hustling waitresses.

For two of us to eat and drink for a whole game was only $45. The food also had great taste. The tacos I thought would be small but we're decent size for the price. Favorite item was the pesto flatbread though! Another plus is the many options of beers. I prefer cider and they don't have many on draft but this is the largest cider selection I have found!",

While we do not we aren't fully able to enjoy the place as often or for as long as we'd like. Food is awesome. Definitely recommend the pretzel with the beer cheese. Have tried many options on the menu and have yet to be disappointed (burgers, flatbread pizzas, salads etc). The beer selection is amazing. If you do a sampler they will customize your selections based on your palate preferences. Even better- if you don't like one of their choices they will exchange it- no questions asked. Service is very friendly. The owner is awesome and makes sure to greet each customer at some point. Supposedly more locations are coming to Las Vegas which would be perfect!  Make it more convenient and I'll up the review to 5-stars!",

Also told us he was gonna bring waters and didn't. (at this point I'm not thirsty any more) We ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich, burger was like a hockey puck and tots were cold.

Another server came over which I can tell we weren't in his section and finally helped us.  The food was okay.  We orders the steak flatbread and pretzel. The pretzel was too salty that I was literally scraping the salt off.  The drinks were okay too.  Average experience I guess.",

We got a great seat at the bar and our bartender was VERY attentive - our beers were always replenished before we were even finished with the one we were drinking. The buffet was filled with typical bar snacks which were good BUT I wish had a few more healthier choices (maybe more veggies and fresh fruit trays for next year .) They had a lot of raffles and giveaways, including 2 sets of VGK tickets as well! All of the staff members, including the bar manager, were really nice, really welcoming and we had a great time.

She was patient with our indecisive group. Since it was the first day of NFL we decided to get finger foods. (Plus we decided to binge all day)   We ordered three flights, 1. intro to hops, 2. Tour of Belgium 3. Intro to WOB flights. We all took turns tasting each sample and finished the one we choose. Yes it is worth it!!!  The finger foods we ordered were the nachos (with chili) 20 piece wings flavors parm chicken, spicy Korean and something that was sweet I forgot. Oh and tatertots. The wing sauces are made to order, pretty amazing. Everything we ordered was very good!! Tater tots were .. well taters lol can't go wrong. As far as the wings, begeezus.. So damn good. The nachos are finger lickin' good, I almost died tho.. jalapenos are kickin'!   What makes everything 10000000000x better is the amazing service we received! Pua (again sorry) John, Jen, some girl with short hair up to her shoulders managed to chime in with great service and checked on us. These people were the best part of our meal. They definitely made our experience worth while.  Hopefully we can catch the same crew on our next visit.",

The shredded beef was soggy w/ the overbearing sauce so I gave it to my starving guy friend & ordered another one, plain.  The plain was dry & I narrowed it down to the beef just not being right.  I shared it w/ my girlfriend & she couldn't finish her half either.  We told Fredi, but we had already paid our bill so she told the chef.  Change it please.   The Tuscan or Pesto Hummus was great, but I wish they put veggie sticks & Pita, instead of Pico de Gallo & Pita... which none of us ate.    Very nice beer selection of course & they no longer have the free beer w/ check-in offer fyi.  I'm not a beer drinker so no big deal, but it was a nice offer.    Chicken Salad after five or six bites was horrible, we thought it would get better, but it was tasteless & not totally fresh.  I thought ok let's try the Macaroni & Cheese, not the fried bites, how could we go wrong here... it was burnt w/ hardly any cheese.  What in the world!  I will say to be on the safe side the Hummus & he Chimay Burger are the best.  Other than that, some items need to be changed or done away with.  Sorry Wolf, you left before I could mention these things to you.  We will be back & hope to upgrade the stars, but it will be awhile.",

Went to try and order brunch as it was Saturday and was told they only offer it on Sunday's . Was very disappointed . The service was slow and not great. Only one server was working for 8 tables. We got the wrong menu initially for weekday lunch and almost ordered wrong food that wasn't being served as it was the weekend. Definitely should have more staff on a Saturday at 12:00 .",

Our first choice was the Green Chili Chicken Nachos.  Pretty decent coverage of toppings including cheese, black beans and jalapenos.  The menu says it's supposed to be spicy cheese but I didn't catch any of the zing.    We also shared the Beer-brined Crispy Chicken Sliders.  I would not order these again.  Very very dry and lacking any flavor.  The IPA sauce was non existent.  There was maybe a dab which you couldn't taste.  It's unfortunate.    Our service from Rachel was really good.  She was very attentive and friendly.  Although the service was good, the food needs some improvement.",

In addition to the beer and apps menu offered at Happy Hour, there are cocktails  ($5 Tito's Vodka!). I am sure this place is always great, but between the Monday burger special and Happy Hour pricing, this family of 3 enjoyed dinner and 2 rounds of drinks for less than $50!",

    "text": "5 stars for beer selection.  1 star for food allergy concern. I can't say I've ever been able to go out and have a gluten free beer next to my boyfriend who drinks normal beers, until now. And I've had my gluten issue for almost a decade now.  He was able to find a flight of beers they recommended and he loved which included: - lost coast great white ale - ipa (not sure the blend, but he said phanto something?) - dogfish head pumpkin ale - belching beaver nitro peanut butter milk stout And I found an entire shelf of gluten friendly beers (half off for the day) along withb3 shelves of ciders (not a personal fan but thats an opinion) including a triple Belgian by Green's and and ipa by Green's. Personally I preferred the ipa. But the triple was good too. Boyfriend also ordered a citrus-y double ipa (we don't remember the brand sorry) after his flight and enjoyed it.  Regarding the food.... they have a special \"gluten friendly\" menu, but upon asking about their grilled chicken (dry rub, buffalo, and garlic parmesan) we found that they are grilled and then fried in the same frier as all other breaded items. Hardly qualifies them as gluten friendly.. needless to say we weren't able to order food. But in my opinion, for a \"bar\" to carry am entire shelf of gluten sensitive beers, that earns a 5 star review regarding their main attraction - beer. Thanks for thinking of us gf folks.",

Many tv screens hang over the bar and there is both outdoor and indoor seating.  The food is upscale bar food. On Sundays they have breakfast and brunch including a bottomless alcohol add on for $21.00 or so.  The food is good but didn't knock my socks off. But for a mall bar it has a lot to offer.  The staff was friendly, sometimes too attentive as I was constantly asked if I needed anything, perhaps because my table was in the server's path to the bar.  Overall it is a nice addition to the galleria cuisine choices especially when you drop your teen off during football.",

We gave up and sat, but had to wait for a server to notice us. iPad didn't work right away, but he got us another to look over the beer.  Not into the food selection. Everything I have had has been good, but I have a hard time picking something that sounds good. Most places there are too many good options. Don't know if they have a veggie burger option, but it wasn't advertised if they do.  And their Ladies Night has a hash tag of #girlsdrinkbeer, but the specials are for well drinks and wine. But not beer?  Overall underwhelmed.",

I never once had to look around and say, \"where is my server\" and they checked on us in a genuine and not pushy manner that made me feel they were authentic and striving to make each and every person that ate here tonight happy.

It's located at the Galleria Mall, but the entrance is on the outskirts of the mall so you don't have to worry about entering the mall period. It's a spacious spot, and they have booths, tall tables, you can sit outside and play some games, or just eat at the bar! On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I were sat down, and we didn't think we waited very long at all to be served. But our waiter was very apologetic about the wait, and continued to check up on us throughout our dinner. That goes to show they have a standard of their own! I always end up getting the two crispy chicken sliders with a side of fries. It's great for your pocket during happy hour which is Monday to Friday during 2-7pm and Sunday to Thursday during 9 to closing.",

I can't believe all the negative reviews!! You people are crazy!!!

But my God..... the service is horrible! Bartenders hate their job and the manager was a little bit of an asshole who doesn't cater to his guests.  I will still come here, considering the wonderful Sunday deal. $23 for bottomless mimosas, beermosas, or blood Mary's plus a breakfast item. Can't beat that deal. But we felt like we were in church, small crowd, we asked to turn ONE of the games up (denied) then we asked if we could at least hear music  (denied). So basically we heard everyone's conversation the whole time we were there.   Again, this place has potential, if the manager and Bartenders didn't have such rude remarks I would be recommending this place. But not until they get it together",

Have tried most of their menu which is all pretty tasteful. The bartender Matt is the best! He's very knowledgeable and has great recommendations.",

Definitely worth it for $5 each! Had the tacos, tried both chicken and barbacoas, which were full size ftw! Mac and cheese bites were bomb! The meatball sliders were okay, they were on the dry side but still tasty. Tater tots went really well with our flights of beer (not included in the happy hour) My favorite was the Margherita flat bread! Definitely must try, it was so goood!!!!!   The reason why we decided to go here was definitely the choices of beer, which did not disappoint, more than 500 beers to pick from. I had the local beers flight which were all delicious! Definitely will come back!",

That would have been OK except that the sound system wasn't cranked up loud enough to  overcome the crowd noise.  Also, we couldn't hear the music round.  But the worst part was that they let a team of 10 win first place after announcing 3 times that teams with more than 6 cannot win.   Biggest beer selection I've ever seen (living up to their name).  The food was OK, but the portions were kinda small.",

Every time I've been here the service and help has been perfect.  No shortage of beer....55 draft taps, local brews, and the full rainbow etc.  They also have an infusion tower that puts a creative twist on your favorite beers infusing them with unique flavors.  Bottles, cans , drafts in the hundreds.  Sunday 11am-3pm bottomless booze brunch for $25.  As far as the food it's your pretty standard bar food mix up. I'd figure the beer is the main attraction and the food is the step child.  Beer, beer and more beer! Hooray for the beer!!!!!",

My bf had finished his beer and we had both been finished with our apps, but we had to look around the restaurant trying to make eye contact with our server for 5-10 minutes before he came back over to us and unapologetically asked if we were ready to order. A table that came in after us, ordered and received their food by the time our server came back for us. We just took the check and left hungry because we didn't feel like waiting another 45 minutes to eat. We both work in bars/restaurants so we're always really understanding when it's busy but we should not have been waiting there for that long.",

I come here about once a month to check out the new beers they rotate on draft. Sometimes when its busy its a bit slower service but the servers and bartenders always keep an eye on my beer and check in which is nice. Its a very laid back environment that i can really unwind in. Its not your typical restaurant that you want to get in and out of in 30 minutes, unless its lunch time which also has some deals on the lunch menu. Knights games, Trivia nights and Live music are my favorite times to go as well, its more of a going out for the night kind of vibe without all the Vegas traffic and wierdos. I highly recommend this place if you are have a positive attitude and good vibes, no place is perfect but for this price, quality and selection you cant be mad!",

Service:  I've always say at the bar for the evening happy hour and the bartenders have all been great.  Always checking on your drinks and food to make sure everything is going well.  Food & Drinky Drinks: The beers I've ordered on draft off the happy hour menu have always been cold, optimally stored and never flat.  My favorite happy hour foods all at $5 Margherita Flatbread:  Tasty and great value for the price.   Mac & Cheese Bites: 6 bites that work very well with the dipping sauce Crispy Chicken Sliders: you get 2 sliders  and the chicken is flavorful All the happy hour food specials is great drinking food especially with beer, go figure  Ambiance: Lots of big TVs above the bar which can be seen throughout the whole establishment.  It gives off a PT's Gold vibe: Local, clean, contemporary with lots of dark wood.  I'm love seeing all the different bar taps and the impressive fridges of bottled beer for the sampling  This is a place for beer drinkers as the selection is fantastic.  The food has always been good to great and I've never had any issues.  I love how the menus provide information on calories and what type of beer would pair best with the entrees.  I totally appreciate them making me a better foodie through their menu.  I think it's time for a non-happy hour visit to try pair up a main entree with their beer suggestions and I'm excited to try that.  But that's another yelp tale....=)",

    "text": "I feel like if I had any other server my first experience here would not have been so awful. I came in with my boyfriend and his friend and we stood at the front for a while not sure if it was the \"seat yourself\" type of place or if a host was suppose to seat you. So after standing up there for a long time without being helped we figured we could just walk in and sit down wherever. We walked over to the only open booth at the time and it was dirty so we just stood in front of it waiting to be helped. Finally someone saw us and cleaned it off for us and brought us some menus. After 15 minutes of sitting there and not being helped our server, Andrew, finally came over to take our drink order. Then it took him such a long time to bring us three waters. Finally after waiting a total of 20-30 minutes JUST for waters, he took our beer/food orders. I decided to get the Belgian s'mores waffle since I recently ate. I wanted to get a vodka cranberry but I knew it wouldn't go well with the waffle and asked him what to do. Instead of suggesting drinks that I might like with the waffle, his response was \"Yeah, the vodka cranberry wouldn't go well with that waffle.\" So I ordered the waffle and was looking through the beer list while waiting for it to come. The waffle arrived at a decent time and I was surprise to find out it wasn't even a full waffle. They were four tiny bite-sized pieces. With no help from Andrew, I found the double chocolate stout beer and I really wanted that with my dessert. My only problem was that Andrew already dropped off the waffle and DID NOT come back to the table after that for a very long time. I could not wait any longer so I decided to eat it with only water. After 30 long minutes without being checked on and finishing my four bite-sized waffle pieces (which was absolutely delicious, it's the only reason this review gets two stars instead of one), he finally came back. I asked him for a refill of water since I was without water for most of my meal and for the double chocolate stout beer. Once I ordered that beer he had the AUDACITY to tell me \"That would have been good with the waffle.\" Are you kidding me? I WAS TRYING TO ORDER THAT WITH MY WAFFLE BUT YOU NEVER CAME BACK TO CHECK ON US. AND I EVEN ASKED FOR HIS OPINION FROM THE BEGINNING BUT ALL HE SAID WAS THAT VODKA CRANBERRY WAS \"NOT A GOOD MATCH.\" So I angrily responded \"Oh I know.\" Then it took him 15 minutes to bring us the chocolate stout (it could've been the bartender's fault, but at this point, I doubt it). Finally it comes, along with another beer for my boyfriend's friend. My boyfriend wanted to make another beer order but he never came back after dropping off the chocolate stout. At this point we had been there for AN HOUR AND A HALF and did not even order that much. We look around the restaurant and find him flirting with some girls at another table. Once he was finally done doing that we asked him for the check (WHICH TOOK HIM A GOOD 10 MINUTES, WHY?!???) He put it all on one check so we asked for it to be split and he split it almost immediately and brought it back (fastest thing he did all night). We left our cards at the edge of the table for another 10 minutes until he finally came by to take them. My boyfriend's friend stiffed him and my boyfriend tipped him $1. We ALWAYS tip 20% for decent-good service. We all work in the food industry so we know how it can be sometimes but this was absolutely AWFUL AND SLOW service. We were finally able to leave after TWO HOURS. We saw that his main priority was clearly to flirt with the women at the other table. I will give this place another try sometime in the future, and when I do I'll make sure Andrew isn't my server.",

It was just ok. I was put off by the older man, maybe the manager, walking around. The reason is the way he talked to the servers. He was pushy, not aggressive but just like barking at them in a condescending way. I felt bad for the servers. Perhaps he should reconsider his presence on the floor or be more aware of his tone and actions.    Husband ordered his first beer, came out in a snifter. When he asked the waitress for a recommendation for an IPA in a pint, she said let me get the list, I've got 7 tables, I'm really busy.  Overall totally not impressed.",

I arrived early and ordered a nice crisp cold beer which came in Goblet style glass. I ordered 2 beers the first was Fastback Racer, which had a citrus and rye notes. Hop forward and has some bitterness but amazingly drinkable. For an appetizer we had the tater Tots. Tater tots topped with our homemade beer cheese, jalapenos, crispy bacon, scallions & sour cream. These are really good. I like things spicy so having a chance to have a bite of jalapeno with a few tots was quite good. This is a big App so be careful not to fill up on these. I also had the dry rub chicken wings with house made blue cheese. Average wings but the home made blue cheese made up for it. They are more famous for some of their German food creations so I had minimum expectations of the wings. My friend had the schnitzel and he said it was good and flavorful. The staff was very accommodating explaining the different beers and food. The crowd was minimal for a Thursday night and atmosphere was calm and quiet. There were a few families here so don't be discouraged to bring your brood. Thank you for dining at World of Beer. I hope to go back here soon. I like all the choices of beer and I believe I saw a beer club that I would like to tackle. Some menu choices also looked inviting and would like to try a few different things. If at Galleria mall and want to get a cold frosty one and a good snack swing by and soak this joint in.",

    "text": "I guess the best way to describe this place is to say it is exactly what it is, a bar with beer and beer snacks.  Environment: pretty much a sports bar with some tv screens for games. This spot is pretty much a pretty chill spot to hang out with friends and have some beer. They have live music, but I have not experienced it myself.  Service: there usually aren't too many waitress so the times I have been here, I often had to wait a while to order and pay my check. They are all super friendly, but for some reason, there is always a big of a lag with the low staff. I would say if you are planning on staying here for a while, it would be more fitting, but not for a quick drink or meal.   Food and drinks: I have only had their pretzel here, and I think it is actually very good. The dips for it, cheese beer and mustard are for some reason not that great. I think the mustard was a bit sour and the cheese cooled off too quickly, but the pretzel itself is bomb. The beer option is very vast and you have so many to select from. Their cocktails are good, but the beer is usually why people show up here.  Overall, I think this is a good spot for after work or late night beer and snacks. Things run pretty slowly here, but i can see it being a pretty good spot to catch up with friends and nurse a beer.",

Super bowl Sunday, he the owner (hairy old guy), could be seen cussing at employees in front of us (customers) and then rubbing the shoulders of the younger female employees. It really was enough that we actually left and watched elsewhere.   Apparently the #metoo movement hasn't made it this far into Henderson yet.   What we (hubby and I) previously recommended as a cool place to go is no longer cool. No pretzel or beer is good enough to watch an old guy prey on younger employees.  Sadly, we rescind our recommendation of this place.",

We ordered some tacos and wings and the food was okay - typical bar food. Tonight we went, also a Friday night, but there was hardly anyone there and there was no live music. 5pm happy hour on a Friday night and the place was empty? The main reason for the one star is that we order nachos and they were horrible. Tasted like they poured fake cheese from a can or jar over then. Could have counted the number of black beans on one hand. The sour cream was runny and thin. Most of the Chips were dry without even the fake cheese on them. Really awful. We will not be back.",

    "text": "Recently went with my boyfriend and had the worst service ever! And the food left much to be desired. Monique was our server and I would definitely avoid her service if possible! We were greeted shortly after being seated. She asked us for drink orders and we weren't quite ready so we asked for waters. After about 5 minutes she dropped off the waters and we ordered food - my BF a burger and beer cheese nachos for me. I still hadn't decided on my beer so the waitress said she would put in the food order and be back. After 5 minutes I had decided what beer to get and we waited for our server. We saw several other servers attending to nearby tables yet no sign of Monique. After about 10 minutes of waiting (I went to the bathroom and saw our server inside cleaning tables) another server stopped by and asked if she could help so we ordered our beers. About a minute later our server arrives and we told her we had placed our beer orders. So we waited another 10 minutes and got our beers. Now at this point we had been here about 30 minutes and still no food. We watched as another table behind us who ordered food after us received their food. We finally flagged down our server and asked about our food. She said she would go check on our food order. We saw another couple get seated and receive their food within 10 minutes. Monique comes back and tells us the kitchen is backed up and she will make sure to get us a discount. At this time a family of 4 (parents and 2 kids) are seated next to us. They receive their drinks (sodas and alcohol) within 5 minutes. After about 10 minutes someone else brings out our food. At this point I ask to see the manager as it is ridiculous to wait 45 minutes for a burger and nachos. At this point this person identifies herself as the manager. She apologizes with no explanation and offers us a discount or to comp our next round of drinks. My BF's burger was good but nothing special. My nachos were mediocre. The beer cheese tasted like regular nacho cheese and there were very few pieces of chicken which I paid extra for. Not worth waiting for more than half an hr. Shortly after we get our food the family of 4 gets their meals. The part that is disappointing is that clearly the server Monique forgot to put in our order. Clearly there was no \"back up\" in the kitchen as multiple other tables who arrived and ordered after us received their food in a timely manner. If you make a mistake own up to it. And if you are a manager identify yourself as such and speak up prior to the customer complaining to help appease the situation. I have worked in the food industry and there is no need to blame the kitchen if you as a server forget to place the order. The whole situation was poorly handled by the server and manager. The other servers appeared to be doing their job correctly while ours was clearly lacking. We have been here before and never had an issue. Needless to say we will not be back. Seriously waiting 40 minutes for nachos? No thanks. Horrible service and mediocre food for the prices? Not worth it. Monique - 2 thumbs down.",

I'm not a huge beer person, but can appreciate what they have to offer. They have a selection of over 500 craft beers. This is the perfect place to get together with your friends. It's a laid back, friendly atmosphere. Shout out to Jeff, our server, for his awesome hospitality.

We were able to get 4 beers each and only spend $11/12 total, and for some good quality beer that is a great deal. Happy hour specials were pretty well priced and the food was top notch for bar food. We got the fried pickles, shrimp tacos, buffalo wings and a side of Mac and cheese and they were all cooked well and had some great flavor. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is the service was just a tad slow, which we think was just an anomaly with our waiter as everyone else had a little bit faster service. Definitely recommend checking out for some unique beer and great finger food!",

When we were seated, we were handed a menu of only their draught beers (only about 60 or so). Apparently the rest of the beer selection (in bottles) were listed in an IPad (which they ran out of). I would really recommend having more IPads available... since that is what most people come for (the selections of beer). Our food order came out timely & how we ordered it. One thing that I would like to mention was that the Manager was great. We asked for one of the TV's to be changed - and she came out immediately to do so. She also visited our table several times to check on our experience. I really appreciated that extra service!",

The food is good but they could use some more menu items that are vegetarian/vegan friendly. An awesome place to watch sports as well.",

World of Beer has so many different options on tap, bottles and can, that anyone can find something to get. They also have a lot of beer from the local breweries, which is a good way to make a chain seem a little smaller.  They have a good happy hour as well, which goes from 3 - 7. I almost never find a beer I'm interested in on it, but they food options are wide ranging. Another nice feature is the patio. It has its own bar section, multiple seating options, and even televisions to accommodate everyone. I have used it many times when summer is not making it less enjoyable.   If you are in the area and looking for either a fun bar to go to or a good happy hour, check this place out.",

    "text": "This is the place for the beer enthusiast. We've spent a couple of long Saturday nights here watching football trying to make a dent into the 500+ beers they have in-house. We've had some of the food which didn't have us in awe, nor did it disappoint. Service can be slow, but the knowledge of beer, especially from the bartenders, will definitely impress.   This number of taps isn't as many as other places such as Yard House, but what they miss in numbers, they make up for by having taps that rotate daily and a significant number of local brews or limited releases like the 17% Dogfish Oak Aged Vanilla World Wide Stout which is one of the strongest yet most flavorful beers I've had in recent history. They keep the selection spectrum wide enough, and well organized in their app, to keep any beer drinker happy. I'm always up for trying any of their nitro brews, which they usually have three to four tapped.  Also unique to WOB is their infusion tower and cask engine which can be hit or miss depending on the flavors you're in to. Feel free to ask for a taste, you won't get any opposition. What I did see being used regularly and should be implemented in every bar with taps is the star sink, or glass rinser. That extra rinse will lead a to a cleaner glass and pour which will allow you to appreciate the flavors and aromas.  The food was what we expected and everything was made to order. On the menu, they'll have beer suggestions to pair with your food. Unless we're starving and want a separate entree for ourselves, we just usually get shareable stuff and snack throughout the night so we can focus on the beer which is what we are here for. But you can't go wrong with the obligatory nachos and pretzel.  If you're one and done or a two-pump chump as far as the number of beers you drink, the night will be affordable, but if you're in it for the long haul and come in on a Saturday like we did, bring a Grant and probably a few extra Jacksons. Our tabs for two have both been $100+ before tip on both nights. Otherwise make sure to take advantage of their happy hour 2-7 M-F and reverse happy hour Sun-Thur 9-close offering $4 drafts, $5 spirits and shareables, and $6 wines. They also have a rewards program where you'll earn with every dollar spent. I'll keep an eye on the app when they bring in the next beer I'm looking for.",

Some pathetic, disgusting bartender with unwashed hair, that was blonde with faded pink highlights, that was extremely unprofessional, and uncomfortable to be around who also looked unkempt had the audacity to grab our bill, crumple it up right in front of us and throw it at the computer screen all because we took one bite of our medium spiced chicken wings and had our mouths burn for a half an hour, because she couldn't subtract right. She acted like it was our fault, that they make crappy food. Don't be ugly on the inside and unpleasant also. I was embarrassed for you. 201 bartender was her code at 3:00 pm today. You should find another job. I hope you get much needed therapy.",

Servers were more interested in sitting and chatting with other people (friends) that were at another table. I had to go up to the bar and ask for my check for a soda and juice we actually got. Ran into a plain clothes manager on the way, and he wasn't even interested in why we were leaving. Bartender didn't care either and waitress just rudely told us to just leave and not worry about the drinks. We will not give them another try. We work hard for our money and don't go out often, so experience is everything for us. You won't get a good one here.

Michael tried the Pork Schnitzel and said it was good, but a bit bland. (I tend to find all schnitzel bland, but that's just me). The tavern pretzel is a favorite there although we didn't order it this time. The place gets a bit noisy, with sports on the many flat screens and all of the lively conversations going on. But we were still able to hear each other at our table. There's a nice outdoor patio area, as well. We've sat there a few times in the past, and enjoyed it.",

My girlfriend's all I all had different entree's.  The food was on a scale from bland and tasteless to downright gross.  Our service was terrible, we waited a good 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table, appetizer was out before any water or drinks. After our food was delivered we never saw our server again! Another server came over because he saw us looking around for a while.  They charged us for items that we didn't order and took a long time to figure out how to remove the items.  One of my girlfriend's and I are type 1 diabetics and we both had to resort to sugar tablets after the \"meal\" due to the fact we just couldn't eat the food.  I very rarely Yelp about bad service/food I usually just deal with it and go on about my day, reminding myself to never return.  This restaurant was so bad that I had to write a review.  P.s. the Cobb salad comes with Greek dressing! Very dissatisfied! We will not return.",

We were told there were no tables, when there were in fact several open seats. And how did this man not know we weren't meeting someone at one of those tables.  We asked to sit inside and put our name on the list for an outside table when one became available.  We were told it would be \"at least an hour\" we had no problem sitting inside. Spending our money.  Until a table became available. However the \"owner\" wouldn't let us sit and enjoy our happy hour in peace.  Congratulations.

Myra was behind the bar and was very pleasant and attentive. Problem was when we got our bill. Tuesday's at WOB are 25% off bottles and cans and they didn't give us the discount for being a loyalty members. When asked, they said they didn't do that. Once I mentioned it was on their app as a part of the location, the answer changed too the customer having to ask for it. I've been to over 20 different WOBs over the past 8 years and never heard of this. Tuesday loyalty day is a company wide discount. I'm assuming the manager or owner came over, a white haired gentleman, grunting about giving us the discount, right in front of us!!",

The wait is usually long enough at Gen that we stop in WOB for a beer or two while we wait. We've always had pretty decent and timely service. The last time we were there we waited a while to be sat (they were busy). By the time we had a table, we waited another 5-10 minutes for a server. We already knew what we wanted (2 beers total) so ordered right away. After waiting another 15 minutes, we got a text that our table at Gen was ready. We tried to look for our server to cancel our order, but couldn't find her, so we left. After being seated at Gen, a woman from WOB walked over to our table to tell us we had to pay for the beers we ordered but were never served (or drank). We didn't want to argue, but we did feel it was a bit ridiculous given how long we had waited without even being served. She invited us to come in after our meal to have the beers we paid for, but we really have no desire to go back.",

Don't you think a server would pay special attention to a table like this? She did not. It was like pulling teeth ordering a beverage or more food. A few of us went to the bar to order drinks. We ended up winning the trivia game and won a $25 gift card. So, we have returned to try it again with our gift card. The service, yet again was not great. We walked in and were not sure where to sit. Nobody was there to direct us or anything. We sat at a table in the bar area and were greeted after having been sat for at least 5 minutes. Upon getting our appetizer my boyfriend ordered a drink, the server forgot it and we ended up getting the beer at least 15 minutes later. I also ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, I really did not like it, but was going to eat it. The server asked if I liked it and I was honest and told him I did not. He took it and said he would take care of it, which I thought was nice, but when we got our check there was only $3 comped off of it. That's fine, but if you were only going to comp $3, why didn't you let me finish it or take it home? If you took it from me you should have comped the meal.   To top it all off we had a $25 gift card and the server explained to us that the computer system would not allow him to charge the full $25 because it leaves room to \"allow for a tip\". What if I did not want to leave a tip? (Of course we did) this doesn't seem okay to me. Probably will not be returning again.",

Shocked to find out when we received our bill that they didn't take the flat bread off the bill. Wow, restaurant screw up 101, hair in your food,  you get it for free!  Drink orders took forever! Beer sat on the bar waiting to be served for 5 minutes before I went and got it myself! Server, did not care, neither did the manager! All around, terrible experience, which really sucks because it's has a great atmosphere,  and my husband and I don't get out much, so when we do,  we go to tried and True places.

We ordered something else and of course they had it!  There was a pause when we asked the assistant manager to take back the beer we ordered to replace it with the one they originally said they did not have:( 2 more beers on the iPad and they did not have it:(  Also our party of 8 ordered and only 6 beers came to the table! If you are marketing yourself as a specialty beer spot your staff needs to have knowledge about the beers and you need to have up to date menus!",

The restaurant wasn't full, but wasn't dead either - a nice laid back atmosphere. The beer selection is impressive with a front/back full page draft menu and an iPad which logs their 500 beer bottle selection. We began our meal with Tavern Tots per server recommendation. They were good, but not incredibly impressive. My uncle ordered the Black & Bleu flatbread which he thoroughly enjoyed and had great things to say about. My aunt ordered the veggie wrap with hummus which she enjoyed, but felt the hummus was a bit overwhelming for her. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings which were delicious - and they weren't just chicken nuggets served as boneless wings like you find at many places. As we were dining I noticed they have specials all week long such as Industry Night, Student & Faculty night, Ladies Night and more with great drink specials. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience and enjoyed the expansive beer selection. I will be returning when I have more beer-loving friends and family in town.",

That is extremely disrespectful to continuously nudge our server in the back while we are trying to speak to him. The beer and the servers are great!

I said ok let's do that. She came back with two beers for my gfs, one was wrong. Gave me a water and asked my 18 year old sister if she wanted a different beer because they \"don't have\" angry orchard. WTF. We corrected her and I chose another beer. We had to get a manager to fix the order of the other beer.. then they brought the food. It was good except, one plate had fries but only 7 fries exact. One plate had Mac n cheese which was ROCK hard. We asked for a side of sriracha aioli and she forgot it twice. The third time we asked she brought plain sriracha. It was so dumb we couldn't understand what was happening. When we would tell her what's wrong she didn't understand what we were saying. Idk if she was on drugs or maybe drunk? The four of us will never go back.",

He brought me some samples of the beers on tap. I fell in love with a beer that was not on happy hour (way worth the extra 2 bucks) I ordered the mac and cheese and the chicken sliders YUMMY... Defentally stop buy make shure to ask for Matt",

Being far from quintessential, we were helped by the ever so amiable staff to this innumerable collection of libations. All beers displayed a cool frothy head and crispness likened to sitting on a veranda consuming a tantalizing peach. To compare this liquid gold to the swill I must consume in Utah is blasphemy.

We have probably been here half a dozen times and every time we have waited at least 10 minutes after being seated before a server came to our table.

The servers are nice and the drinks, especially on happy hour, are reasonable and good.  I am deducting a point however based on the food.  I have tried many different items here and it has all just been mediocre at best.  It's weird when you have a full menu with unique items and the pretzel is still one of the better items, along with the chimichurry meatballs, although not in slider form...I feel like the food should be miles ahead but it just isn't.  It's just there so you don't get hammered and that a shame because with such a diverse menu, I feel like they could be on the same level as Yardhouse but they can't compete when it comes to their food in taste, quality, and size.  The service although friendly, is a bit slow though so WOB is getting a slight deduction for that as well.    All being said, still come and check this place out.  It's not open as late as I would like but then maybe that's a good thing because I would probably stay here too long chatting and having a good time.",

Fortunately I had the option of building my own flight of 4 selections. The most memorable of them being the Coronado Switch Stance Blonde Stout. It came from a recommendation from our server. When you go to take a sip you expect your typical blonde ale taste, but no! It is creamy and chocolaty and delicious. It messes with your senses in am awesome way. The food was also really good. We had the pretzel with the beer cheese sauce. Tip - try mixing the mustard and cheese together when you dip your pretzel...yum! Both both the cheese dip and mustard sauce on their own are fantastic. we also had the Barbacoa tacos from the happy hour menu. They were bigger than expected and had great flavor with a nice amount of spice to them. Overall, a great place with lots of beer options, great food, and a fun atmosphere!",

This place is fine it has and excellent beer selections with IPADs on helping you find a beer, an app for your phone as well. BTW anyone that really drinks beers know you don't chill the glass, you give it a water rinse and pour. As far as slow service I just haven't experienced it and I've been here many times. MATT the bartender is on point with service and knowledge. Plus discounts for service industry and fun live music provided (yeah it's live music, it's gonna be loud but it's not the radio either). Food... it's not Joel Robuchon but it's good bar food. The mac and cheese bite on happy hour price deliciousoohhsoo! I do wish some of the stuff was a bit better meh it's in it's zone but I'm smart enough to know what place I'm in and know they can always tweek it with -constructive criticisms- come on yelpers. Area of the bar is big and inviting and the patio is nice and they have cool air fans out there, it's 106 tonight and I'm perfectly comfortable out here in pants and flip flops. A bonus fact every time I've come the restroom have been emasculate that shows a dedication to cleanliness! One more thing any review you read that has someone saying the manager doesn't care is always full of it. All managers care about their customers, it takes a special, ahem (back side) person to make a managers say no to a guest.  So for an honest review of this place  1 real good beer selection 2 clean establishment  3 bar food on par with anywhere else 4 friendly staff (you just have to say hi yourself) 5 management staff that will listen to you and I've seen myself helping out their employees  6 big area for large groups 7 B 8 E 9 E 10 RRRRRRRRR",

They probably have about 50 beers on tap.  Hoppy, dark, light, sour - whatever you want, you can probably find.  They also have a huge selection of cans and bottles.  I didn't really look at the cans and bottles closely, so that would be something to do if I come back.  Food was good pub grub.  Service was polite and efficient.

With the World of Beer being my first bar/restaurant as a new resident of Henderson, I would have to give this place a solid 4 Stars. Location, location, location! WOB can be located in the galleria mall, with the entrance from the outside of the mall. They have an outdoor patio over looking the hillside to the south. The indoor eating area is nice and spacious which offers many TVs to watch sports events!   When we were seated right away on one of the high tops tables in the bar area, our awesome server- Marissa was on it and took our bevie orders right away! Thanks for the awesome hospitality Marissa!   So it's quite clear that if you're a beer lovahhh, this place is all you boo! They offer a plethora of beer options. With my preference being SOURs, it was hard for me to decide which one I wanted so I hoped for a sour beer flight. I loved all of them!   For foods, we hit up the happy hour menu which offered great items! We tried the barbacoa beef tacos, the chicken tacos, the fried Mac n' Cheese, the wings (naked, ofcourse!) with a side of the Korean spicy dipping sauce!   All this food plus beers was the perfect setting while watching the Golden State Warriors basketball game. I was in heaven! The happy hour options here are delicious and reasonably priced.   Cool atmosphere; delicious food? I would totally come back for more delicious sour beers!",

Maybe if the flavors sound appealing to me the next time I come in I'll try it.    The menu is interesting and reflects the WOB philosophy by being a bar menu with international influences.",

Actually all the food I've had here was good. However, the service has gone downhill dramatically.  I left and went to a dog friendly restaurant at Town Sq. the last time I came, as I couldn't get anyone's attention to get waited on, on the patio. The hostess today didn't know of the mystery beer, as she \"isnt 21.\" Waited a really long time today to be acknowledged as well. Come on management, get it together. Yes, this is a suburban mall, and perhaps my expectations are too high.  The beer selection is still top notch. Still need purse hangers and a foot rest at the bar. The patio furniture is disgustingly dirty.",

There were ceiling fans blowing cold air fairly hard no matter where you sat, so I can't say I was comfortable. As expected, when any restaurant is slow, the employees are no longer on their toes and the service suffers for it, which it did. I got the impression they forgot they had a customer at one point. One draught beer is $6.50. The food took much longer than it should have. One meal was way overcooked - almost to the point of being burnt, like the cook also was not on their toes and forgot it was in the fryer. Hamburger however was pretty good. Since we were not even comfortable sitting there because of the cold air blowing, I doubt I would give them a second chance.",

I've been able to try quite a lot of different items from their menu and they have yet to disappoint.  Don't get me wrong...there are a couple things I've had that weren't amazing...but they weren't terrible either...but all in all, the food is very well made.   I would recommend most anything on the menu....as people tastes differ there is something for everyone.  Stand outs for me though: Pretzel, Mac & Cheese bites, pesto hummus, Black and Tan Sliders.......  A must have is the Chimay Burger.....I'm telling you to go and get one right now!!  I've had this burger probably 10 times, and every time it has been cooked to perfection.  The flavors are just on point.    Beers....what can I say...to many to choose from.  They have a cool app that can track the ones you've had.   I think my only negative would be the lack of sports on TV...they have a good number or TVs with random sports but the sound system is lacking so you really can hear your game (if it's on)....although it's not really a sports bar so I don't really blame them.  Would just be nice.",

The server took our drink orders and my food order (nachos as an entree) and started to walk away before my partner ordered. So I stated again the nachos were my meal. The server didn't write down my partners' order (BYO burger: medium on a gluten free bun with ale cheese and caramelized onions with tator tots)  and had to come back to confirm because she forgot details.  My nachos came out minutes later \"so they don't get soggy\" at least 8 minutes later the burger came out. Never mind the nachos were my entree, I was almost done before the burger came.  The staff (because at some point we gained a 2nd server) were exceptionally inattentive to the empty soda and plate. When I got the soda refill I had to hand them the empty plate as they walked away. They had to be flagged down when my partner was done eating (and had been for awhile) to get a box and the check.  I was sorely disappointed at their reaction to our raising the issue of the timing of our food. Because nachos are \"super fast\" and \"only take 5 minutes\". We only received a discount after talking to two different staff and then received a larger discount after I started typing this review.",

We tried 3 different draught beers. We tried the calamari, mac n cheese and the chili. Loved all of it. Especially the calamari.  We will definitely be back our server Jason was great, very upbeat and lively.  The gentleman who seated us checked on us regularly too.

    "text": "We hit this place after a week of trying all the local breweries. Really great selection of over 500+ beers, a lot of which are on draft. Their app (which they have on iPads at the bar) makes it much easier to find something you are interested in based on style, country, etc. The service was good and the people working there were knowledgeable about beer in general and what they had on draft. They always checked in on us and made sure our beer never got low. Extra points for having a daily 50% off beer cooler. This is a fun way to try beer you might not have while getting them at half price.   The only downside I can see to this place is the sort of gross mall location and a general corporate-type vibe inside (probably due to the mall location). We also tried the food and it was OK, not great, a tad spendy for what it was (mall location, again). Overall, stick to hitting the local breweries (Bad Beat and Lovelady arent far away) for a more chill, authentic experience, but hit WOB for overall selection (they also carry the local Vegas beers).",

I have been to 13 different locations around the country and was excited on a recent trip to Nevada that I could add this one to my list. It was larger than I expected. The old food standards I used to enjoy - the Pizza Margherita and the Tavern Tots were always my favorite. I ordered both and they were as I expected. The service was okay sitting at the tables. Most of the action was up near the bar. The one distraction was it was very loud in there. A lot of people, which is good, but the noise level was distracting and I couldn't even hear my own tablemates talking. I had one drink and checked out.",

First off no one was at the front to seat us so after a few minutes  we honestly thought it was self seat so we started to walk back to an empty table only to be pointed back up front and told to wait. We waited and were seated shortly after. We sat down looked at the menu picked out what we wanted for drinks, appetizers and dinner and still no one had even come to our table. Eventually we started a timer, it was almost comical at first but 15 minutes later and not even a sighting of our possible server. We walked past the hostess and told her to give the table to the 2 people waiting because we never even got our drink order put in. She was snotty un-apologetic and rolled her eyes at us. Will not return here or recommend.",

They have a variety of beer selections to choose from, and also their tots are probably one of the best in town. I really love the surroundings, the ambiance is really nice. I wish they had one near where I live-southwest- to enjoy it more often, but I would not mind coming here after work and enjoy some good beer and food. Definitely a place to try out if you are in the area, or even if you are not the area.",

    "text": "After a bit of shopping at galleria mall, I was happy to sit down and relax outside for a bit and try out a new place.   This place offered indoor and outdoor seating, immediately was able to seat myself and received a prompt greeting and drink order. I also ordered the tator tots with the cheese, jalapenos and bacon, I forgot the name but they weren't the poutine tots. They were good, the jalapenos were fresh and the beer cheese wasn't lacking. I hate when places skimp on cheese! I had the bangers and mash and my friend had a burger with avocado and some type of green salsa on it. While we both agreed they were good, but not great, i felt the dishes missed a lot of opportunity for flavor. The orange sweet gravy on the bangers and mash was yummy, and pulled the dish together well. However the sausage, peas, and potatoes were kinda boring and not very fresh tasting. I admit I am a food snob though so don't let this honesty detour you.   For 2 entrees, an appi and a glass of lemonade our meal was only $33. For the price and atmosphere you can't really go wrong for that. I'm sad I left my ID and couldn't try the beers! I feel that would probably be the best part of the place... hence \"Beer\" in the name..   The service was outstanding, and I absolutely LOVED that they allowed a man to bring his dog inside the outdoor seating area. Try this place out! And I hear they have happy hour. They're worth a shot!",

The one back home was strictly a bar and had deals with local restaurants to have food delivered to your table which was still pretty cool, but having a full kitchen makes a big difference.   I've stopped in a few times and each time the service, the beers and the food have been great.  I usually opt for a Belgian quad (my weakness) and a snack while I hang at the bar for a while.   Service is always great. Their flatbread with filet (can't remember the name) is sooooooo good, and their Cali bowl is great for a daytime lunch. I've tried it with the beer battered shrimp and I am hooked. Whatever sauce it is that comes with the bowl, I could put that on anything.   Beers are always cold, service at the bar is always great and the food is always on point.   I'll be back in to try their brunch because the menu looks that good. Props to WOB!",

    "text": "What you need to know: - Decent Beer Selection - Lively Atmosphere - Good Happy Hour Specials - Live Music - Beers on tap will rotate and might run out  The experience: So I have been twice to World of Beer and both times had a slightly above average experience. Definitely has improved over time as they got things more dialed in. My wife and I went last night, she had a free beer for her birthday. We sat at the bar and were greeted quickly, the bartender asked what we were drinking and gave us their beer and food menus. Now, the place is called World of Beer, so you know they have a decent beer selection. I feel it is a good balance though between draft and bottle/canned, they don't go crazy like places like Yard House and have \"300 beers on tap\".  My only criticism was that the 1st two beers that I had asked to sample were both out. We were there at 7pm on a Friday night so I would expect that a bit more for close to the end of the night. However the bartenders good service made up for it and offered some alternatives that were good.  The previous trip we tried some food, this was close to opening so I am not judging them too much on it. The food was ok, nothing to write home about but nothing I would be upset about eating.  Lastly it was nice and I am not sure how regularly they do this but there was a live band playing some Hawaiian music. Not too loud, just a nice thing to have in the background.  Definitely stop by if you are around and want to try some good beer at a decent price.",

Food:   Mac & Cheese Bites: These were fried to crispy perfection, but they seemed a little lacking in flavor.  Loaded Taters: This is definitely worth it during HH. It's a big tray of tots loaded with the works. Our server was nice enough to put everything separately because some of our members had dietary restrictions that we had to work around.  Tacos (Crispy Chicken & Barbacoa): The tacos are surprisingly good, even if they aren't \"authentic\" per se. They come on fluffy flour tortillas and are packed with flavor. The chicken is perfectly crisp and the barbacoa is juicy. The barbacoa is a crowd favorite if you have to choose one.  BYO Burger  Service: 4  Servers are really nice and handle big groups well. However, they do seem a bit short staffed when it gets a little busy and they will leave you mostly to your own devices. So just keep in mind that it will be almost next to impossible to flag down a server when they're busy.  Ambiance: 4  It's a pretty nice pub with lots of different seating choices. It does get pretty noisy, as places like this tend to get, so don't come here if you want a quiet meal.",

The brunch burger has bacon, arugula, fried egg, patty with cheddar cheese served on a brioche bun.  The egg was cooked perfectly and cut open oozed all over the burger.  The sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside and soft sweet on the inside.  They dusted it with powdered sugar.  It was rich and decadent and definitely reminded me of brunch.

    "text": "These guys rock my world.  World of Beer (WOB) is a paradise, albeit one which I would only have appreciated around this time last year after I started to explore the world of craft beer. They're located in the upper outdoor \"plaza\" of the Galleria mall in Henderson, sandwiched between not-best-in-genre AYCE KBBQ and charrasacuria (Brazilian steakhouse) restaurants. Parking is considerably easier on weekdays than on weekends; this is a mall, after all.  WOB is the only legit beer bar on this side of town, and I will argue this to death. Sure, there's a place over on Marks with over 200 draft beers, but the 50+ drafts here consistenly contain a more refined, higher quality representation of brews. I have seen (via their website and in-person) and tasted rarer, more desirable beverages here than at this competitor bar (via other app and in-person). Recent WOB examples include 120 Minute IPA and BBA Palo Santo Marron, both from Dogfish Head, and Man's Best Friend #002 from local Big Dog's Brewing Company.  The foods are not the main reason to come here, but those which I've had here are solid. Mahi mahi tacos, shrimp tacos, and loaded tots are all enjoyable. The tacos, by the way, are among the cheaper items which can be used as the paid prerequistie for the current Yelp check-in offer of a free local draft beer. This is why I've yet to explore the Monday $5 burger and Tuesday taco specials.  World of Beer is an amazing local craft beer spot. If you're into that kinda thing at all, check out their updated beer list on their website ASAP, or just swing by if you live nearby like I do or happen to be passing through the area.",

Tearing and crumpling a piece of paper at our table isn't the greatest way to get return business. You create a very hostile and unbearable experience. I'm sorry that all you have made of your life is being a trivia host, my engineer co workers and I really look to have an enjoyable night after a long real day of work.

Very open as well.  Tons and tons of beers to choose from as well as ciders!  For ciders i recommend ace space!  Tenaya creek brew is always a great choice  They also have happy our 4 to 7pm i believe.  Burgers are awesome and the beer battered shrimp tacos were off the chain.  Ushually its a hit or miss with these kind of places but they must of had a super skilled chef back there..  The only reason for my 4 stars if because if you dont know where this place is it can be somewhat confusing. Their actual sign wasnt lit up and the entrance kinda seems like a back door or side door to the surrounding establishments!  I would highly recommend coming here if you have family from out of town or a large group!!  Also its worth the drive i live super far it was about 25 min drive or 30 but well worth is just go in the evening.",

Unfortunately this morning when I decided to bring in some tourist to WOB I was greatly disappointed and embarrassed by the service offered this morning. The service industry is a thriving, busy part of Las Vegas and its unfortunate that WOB is not up to par. Our server offered items that were unavailable, he failed to put in our food order in a timely fashion and on top of it all he also failed to even offer a simple understanding or apology. Along with the management I appreciated her comping part of the bill but the manager as well failed to realize that this shit show shift isn't normal. WOB has real potential to be a nice gem but the way it is currently running I don't foresee it surviving. So basically save your money and try another restaurant.",

The right side of the restaurant has the imported beer in bottles and cans. The German pretzel was freaking AMAZING! I loved it, the perfect appetizer. The fat tire cheese was awesome! I even ate the cheese with my steak fries came out, GREAT COMBO! The sandwich I felt needed more chipotle sauce, wasn't spicy at all. It was tasty though. Happy Hour starts at 2pm. They have very good drink specials, and they have very good craft options! So many beers on tap! Their drink menu, is very organized by the type of beer. Very easy to pick out what kind of beer your searching for, the menu is made to reduce confusion. They even have different beer combinations. For example I forgot to take a pic of the menu but if you like beers that are similar to a sour, I would recommend the Red Monk! Sweet but similar to a sour, very freaking DELICIOUS!!",

The mac n cheese bits are warm and gooey.  The dipping sauce has a bit of a kick.  The street tacos are delightful.  This last time I have the chicken, but I have also partaken in the beef.    There are a number of sausage-related dinner options.  Hubby's mind was blown.  He is ready to come back and get the bangers and mash next time.  Delightful food.  Good customer service.

The beer selection is awesome though. If you like trying new beers this is a great place to go.   Service is generally pretty good. There have been times we have had a really long service time. Sometimes it's busy sometimes it's slow. Other times, service has been exceptional.  Examples of some food I've liked there:  The pretzel and sliders shareables. The chimay burger and steak and frites.  Things that I haven't liked: The Mac and cheese bites, the tacos, the buffalo chicken sandwich and chipotle sandwich.  The one item that really bummed me out was the \"korean spicy wings\". I LOVE korean food. The buffalo wings were good so I ordered the korean ones. But they just tossed them in gochujang. That would be the equivalent to tossing wings in franks instead of wing sauce.  Had they just put more care into the wing sauce by adding some ginger, honey, soy sauce etc. the wings would have been awesome. That's how I feel about their food. Clumsy and half hearted. Not bad food just disinterested food.  Fortunately, their service environment and beer selection make up for it.",

Not only did I get to enjoy my favorite beer but was also recommended other beers that were delicious. The service was amazing! We actually drove back from Arizona the next day because we had such a good time. We were served by Andrew and he was amazing. He has an amazing personality and made us feel welcomed. It's hard to find servers and bartenders that you can joke back and forth with. As a server myself I know the stress of the job and how important it is to keep your customers happy and Andrew did more than that for us. We will be back again soon!",

Well guess what...I can find the same selection of beers elsewhere where the sound will be on..oh by the way the music is obnoxious to the point that you can't here the person next to you to discuss the beer you are drinking or whatever just happened on the game you were trying to follow on the tv...good by",

Figured he had not put in the order. We asked to pay for our two beers from the manager/owner? Bill came out to $9.75, we gave them $10. And he had the audacity to say \"wow\".

The service, on the other hand, was absolutely confusing and frustrating.   First, we went on a lady's night that they advertised to be 20% off the whole tab for ladies. We were never seated properly, and it took a good 15 mins before anyone came to take our order. When we asked the server about the special, she looked confused and said \"I think there is some sort of special, but I'm not sure. Maybe 10% or 15% off, I can never remember.\" Ummm what?! I told her it said 20% off online and she just went along with it.   The beer was great and the variety was definitely impressive. The cocktails were atrocious, please please please save your money and stay away from any drinks that aren't beer. I got a cosmo and it tasted like hexane mixed with cough syrup, no joke.  The server came back and didn't take the 20% off our tab. We had to remind her and she took off additional 20% on top of the happy hour price. We stayed longer and ordered more, but the server on the next shift wouldn't honor the 20% on happy hour food even though the last server did AND it said on their website that ladies get 20% off the check 7 PM-12 AM. I'm just so confused. Not angry, but confused.  Anyway, food is great, will probably come back for the burger and beer, but no to cocktails and no to service.",

The only thing on tap--they don't have very many pale ale's. They did have one that was CRAZY good.  Modern Times Trueland. That one was great.   The food was good. It wasn't great, as I was hoping. The pretzel was pretty good and the beer cheese was delicious. But the main dishes were just \"okay\". Most of them had a ton of garlic on them. So much, that I've been tasting it for 2 days now. That's not very appealing to most people. I had the Steak Frites. It was good and tender. But the quality of the meat didn't seem that great. But for the price, it was quite alright.   The server was good. There were about 10 of us there for almost 4 hours and he kept pretty good tabs on us. We did miss out on a couple of beers. He was super nice though.   The second best thing here would be that they play fights and other types of sports. AND they take reservations for larger parties. That's a huge plus.   I hope they open one in the Summerlin area.   Maybe we'll make our way back down there one day. But it won't be soon, because we're too lazy to drive that far.",

    "text": "Beer Paradise!  Bullet point review:  - Largest selection in Vegas (nearly 600 in bottle / 40 on tap, ever rotating with great selection of Nevada craft brews).  - Cool vibe without being craft beer pretentious.  No man bun bartenders who scoff at your lack of knowledge.  Sit at the bar if you want to learn about the beer you're drinking, else rely on the excellent descriptions on their mobile app.  - Full bar for non beer drinkers (though why would you come to a place called World of BEER).  - Lots of TV's and games to keep you entertained and test your inebriation level.  - Well priced HH (rotating list of $4 somewhat interesting drafts, $5 beer worthy bar bites, Guinness  bathed brat FTW).  Good daily promos.  - Decent grub.  Everything designed to work with beer.  Nothing fancy.  Crispy, moist but oily, plate of beer battered fish and tater tots with an apple kale coleslaw (great with beer), a slightly dry but well flavored beer can chicken (good nuisances of the beer permeate throughout, garlic mash and pan gravy bring it all together, sweet sour onions brighten it up).   Great breaded and fried pickles (dill pickle chips, peppadews and spice warming pickled green beans whose warm vinegar goodness makes beer sing).  Finally, a giant pretzel.  What's to say, it's a big a$$ pretzel and beer's buddy!  - Fast and local service at the bar.  Only downside; unless you live in Henderson, this place is FAR, made worse by the lack of expressways and highways.  Visitors, 30 minute Uber from the Strip.  In a word, fun.",

We were asked to move because a larger party was coming in (okay understandable) so we've now asked four times if they can switch the TV they sat us in front of to the game we came here to see. Still nothing. Like, why am I even here then bro? We've resorted to streaming it on our phone which we could've done at home without the overpriced beer. Jussayin'.  UPDATE: still no game. Ordered an appetizer 40 min ago. Still no food. Just gonna pay for it and leave. There's only 15 min left of the game anyways. Legit paying for food we're not going to eat just to get out of here.",

    "text": "The GF and I had an appointment on the other side of the valley in the kingdom on Hendo.  After a trip of such magnitude, one or two needs food and maybe a beer or two.  I hopped on the trusty lap top and begged the hamsters to work as I fired up the <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a>. BOOM!  WOB presented it's self.  Arrived in the all too familiar mall parking lot, I have parked in, who knows how many times. Walked an ohhhh soooo familiar walk......and then I reached down and opened the door for my lady and in we stepped.  In we walked into a magical world with 500 (bottled) beers on the wall. Take one down...pass it around...500 bottles of beer on the wall...Wait, what....Take one down, pass it around...four hun..500 bottles of beer on the wall.  Confused?  Don't be!  There is always one to replace the original..but I digress.  We were greeted in happy fashion.  Met two other employees, sort of, before a nice lady came to take our order.  There are all sorts of beers!  Over 500 for that matter.  There is something for everyone!  If you check in on yelp, you can get a local beer for free!!  The southern Nevada beer scene is awesome!  This particular check-in allowed me to sample another Lovelady gem, which is also not to far away, I might add.  The GF had some crazy infused cider from some even crazier contraption at the bar.  It was divine!    I took in the atmo, very pubish, with lighting I have seen in other places on the west coast.  During lunch on a Friday, I found the vibe to quit relaxing, my physical reaction to finding an awesome venue at the Galleria Mall, I found shocking!  Malls are not cool nor are they relaxing.  Not a lot of people.  Large televisions were everywhere.  The service was friendly.  I took note of the retractable walls that led to the outside.  Cool October desert air flowing inside.  The though of these same portals being open during a monsoonal storm, made me emotionally erect. Sipping cool brew, while a T-storm rips through Hendo....would be awesome!  The food:  I asked our lady what she recommended, and she instantly said, \"Chimay Burger.\"  Well now!  Chimay is monk beer made with pixy dust.  I'll have that!  \"Fresh beef burger piled high with Chimay Classique cheese, sauteed mushrooms, & caramelized onions. Served on a brioche bun with house-made Chimay sauce. Complement it with a Belgian Tripel\" (retrieved from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldofbeer.com&s=26ae1adadc64bd9447aad2569437cac8a6fcbe43218c1fc814d0995c42f7257a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">worldofbeer.com</a>).  Ordered medium well....it knocked my socks off.  The tots that accompanied it were equally awesome!  Great spot!  I would absolutely visit again!  After further inspection of my review....I am giving WOB and extra star!",

They have 50 beers on top and a really nice outside seating area with market lights around the palm trees.

    "text": "Such a great experience. I found out about this place while shopping at the Galleria. There isn't much advertisement for this place so I did not know when this place actually opened. A friend invited me to check it out on a Wednesday night and I was quite impressed.   World of Beer has a great location. In the Galleria next door to Gen Korean BBQ, it was quite easy to find and there was plenty of parking located right in front of the place. My party of 3 arrived at 8pm. The host greeted us immediately and we were able to sit at a table that we picked. There were only 4 other tables and a few people sitting at the bar. There is a nice patio but it was a bit chilly so we decided to sit at a booth inside.   Our server Andrew M. was nothing short of excellent. We asked him for food and drink recommendations and were glad that we listened to him because the choices were awesome. We ordered a pretzel (be warned, it's huge and good for about 3 people). The pretzel came with a side of cheese and Dijon mustard. It was perfectly buttered and filling! We also ordered wings, half spicy Korean and half garlic Parmesan. As warned by Andrew, the Korean wings were a bit spicy but super tasty! We enjoyed both flavors but loved the Korean wings because we love Spicy! We also listened to Andrew and got the Shrimp Tacos with Aioli sauce and Barbacao Tacos. I was really happy about our order but even more satisfied due to the amazing service Andrew provided us with.  Andrew talked about how the place just opened and what to expect in the coming weeks like brunch with Bottomless Beer, Beermosas, Mimosas and Bloody Mary's. That sounds like such an amazing thing especially during football! (Did I mention they have tons of flatscreen tvs to show games). I moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and what this city needs are more brunch places with bottomless brunch that is a good place to watch sports! Andrew was also knowledgeable about all the different beers that they carried (soo many beers, it's amazing). He also offered to bring board games to the table which was really nice. The had games like \"never have u ever\" and Jenga. Which is such a good idea!! Especially waiting for food! And then again to play after a few drinks!  Because of the experience our server Andrew provided us with I give this restaurant 5 stars! We will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  As far as selection of beer, this might be the best in town.  In Henderson, World of Beers is top for sure.  They offer sample of 4 oz for about $2-4 per draft and also smaller samples from te bartender to try before ordering a pint, for free!  The thing that places World of Beers above the rest is their selection of high ABV brands of beer.  From their extensive draft list of over 30, I found about 15 above 7%, which is very remarkable for Vegas.  Their can/bottle list is even better as it's listed at an affordable price with most under $12, even rare, Belgian varieties.  They ave an easy to navigate menu for bottles/cans as well as . regular draft menu that' sup to date.  On top of this, they had a Happy Hour 5-7pm which offers some draft beer discounts on pints, a hlaf dozen $5 food options, and $6 wine.  In all, the waitstaff is great and the Happy Hour is awesome.  The selection is fantastic as well.  My Lots of TVs and an indoor/outdoor venue makes it great for summer.  My biggest complaint was that the flights are not priced consistently.  When receiving the check, I was caught off guard that my flight was about $14, as each pour ranged from $3-4 rather than a consistent $12 (or the like) price for a flight.  I would like some consistency in flights, but overall I was very happy with my night out, watching sports, drinking great beer, and enjoying the Happy hour food menu.  I will be back certainly when I'm in the area.  Please expand to Summerlin!",

    "text": "I genuinely can't say enough about this WOB location. The people, the service,  the food, the atmosphere, the cleanliness, the offers, THE BEERS... everything just deserves 5 stars.   Here's my top reasons and tips that you need to appreciate them to the fullest!   Reasons and Tips:   Food - Order anything or everything... especially during happy hour It's hard to not afford all of it if you have a partner in crime to share the load with. Follow them on facebook to keep up with their daily specials and pictures of new menu items. CALLING ALL VEGETARIANS, they've got you covered! I highly recommend the tavern tots, any burger, anything served with fries because they're unreal, sweet kale salad, the flat breads and anything on the brunch menu. (Also the brunch doesn't get any better $25 for an entree of your choice and unlimited beermosas, mimosas, and bloodymarys).  Beer - Do you even beer? Well if you do, download the app and sign up for a WOB account because you get all types of perks. My favorite being that the new kegs are updated practically real time on the app. They have an awesome rotating draft list, at any given hour during your visit a keg could go and they could throw a different one on there. Also keep an eye out on the infused beer. Daily they switch out the fruits in the clear infuser that adds a hint of sweetness and fruity flavors to their selected tap attached. [ask for a sample] That leads me to another thing SAMPLE SAMPLE SAMPLE! Not sure about it? Ask to taste! They're usually even ahead of the game and bring a few similar ones for you to try as well. Don't forge about the coolers too, they even will do cooler sales such as 50% off anything is cooler 1. The black board to the right of the beer coolers also usually has the specials written on there. Currently all Okotberfest beers are $5 and it's not just a little pint (Oct 2017).   Team - Those working there are absolutely amazing. Without going anywhere near daily I always feel welcomed back as if living I'm living in a small town. I specifically have to highlight the bartender Sarah who's been there since it opened and knows her beer (I owe you more tips girl because you're doing big things over there). Secondly I have to shout out the server Jeremiah because he was nothing but attentive when a few of us came to watch the mlb play offs. So much that when we mentioned we'd see him for the next game, he without us asking kindly reserved the couch seating area for us to watch again in the same spot. I couldn't be more thrilled with his thoughtfulness and really just for recognizing us. The manager on staff is also really kind, you'll often see him out pushing in chairs and running food to tables which is nice to see. He gave me a little heat about the dodgers but I can overlooked that since he always friendly. I'll have to return with two more bartender's names because they too are worth including! [I told you couldn't say enough about this place].  Atmosphere and Cleanliness: They have an awesome patio with soft lighting, a few fire pits with big chase lounge chairs, and some high top seating for couples and large groups. There's also a few outside bar seats that are awesome but you have to keep an eye out for those bad boys. The bar itself accommodates quite a few people and you can dine on the full menu there. I personally dine there most although I'm still waiting for purse hooks [hint hint]. They also have high top booth, regular booth and table that can accommodate larger groups as well. All with a great view of many TVs. My favorite spot though is the couch area just inside the door, it's like your own private living room with seating and a large coffee table for your food and drinks. The restaurant is spotless, I can't think of a time I've even seen a napkin or straw wrapper on the floor. The same goes for the restrooms as well.",

There are plenty of big screen TVs for your favorite sports game however, the atmosphere is laid-back, so don't expect any sound for the games. For me personally, this is a plus.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I waited and didn't know to seat ourselves or wait so I walked over to two young women (employees) talking behind the bar and had to interrupt them to ask if we should seat ourselves they said \"no go wait by the hostess stand\" there's no \"stand\" it turned out to be a barrel which is fine but it was sort of confusing since we've never been there before. I didn't think to look for a barrel to wait at especially since there was no hostess there. I thought the customer service wasn't great. No one apologized for the confusion and no one to greet us. The food wasn't that great either. The drinks were decent. I wouldn't recommend World of Beer, you're better off going to Yard House, Miller's Ale House, Red Robin, even Buffalo Wild Wings. I would never go back to WOB again, it's nothing special at all.",

However after my last experience it was fucking disappointing. In the last visits the witness was being mean/giving us shitty service, tipped herself the tip she apparently deserved. No. We didn't say much the first time because it was weird but we didn't make nothing of it. Until the second time she tipped herself an amount she didn't deserve, due to her shitty service. When we go out we always tip cash, I've worked in the food industry and my bf family has as well to know how it's like. I find it disrespect to not give a person the tip they deserve. However this girl doesn't deserve anything. I believe she has us confused with someone else but that fact that they know we go there often and accuse of not paying the waitress a tip, is pretty ridiculous. Took her 30 mins to get us a sprite. The fact that she was being petty to us for no reason and we are loyal customer that tip in my opinion / more than some deserve/was insulting. Only good thing of this place is food but oh well ",

Their menu was diverse and offered something for everyone. My friend had fish-and-tots while I had a BBQ burger, both of us were impressed at the flavor. Towards the end we noticed servers walking around with s'mores waffles and decided to indulge - the best decision of the night for sure.  Our server was friendly and the service had a moderate wait time, but the TV's with the game and the atmosphere made it so we didn't mind. It felt very casual and modern - a great hang out spot! The patio was beautiful with fire pits, couches, and tables.  The only thing that put a slight damper on the evening was the fact that children were allowed inside the pub. It seems to me like the kind of place that would be - and should be - \"adult exclusive\".",

The atmosphere is nice and inviting, but the selection of beers is lacking. We asked for about 6 different beers that they don't even have...World of beer my ass. I ordered a Bloody Mary that was overpowered with ice and spice. So I changed my selection to a mimosa instead....about 90% OJ. When i asked the server for a mimosa with Champaign in it, her reply was \"oh sorry it's because we are almost out\" So I get screwed on the drink that I paid for? Nice! The only reason i am giving this place 2 stars is because the chicken and waffles was Bomb and our server was actually really sweet and attentive. Other than that, we won't be back.",

    "text": "World of Beer is actually pretty great! They have a huge selection of beers, and a pretty tasty lookin' menu. You definitely won't leave disappointed (about the food).  We first arrived around 2:30pm to check out the menu. They were going to seat us and we decided we wanted to sit at the bar top. We were greeted by a lady who seemed like she didn't care about us and towards the middle of it we realized her shift was actually ending, so it made sense... (would have been five stars if not for her kind of awkward service). I get that you're about to leave but you should still act like you care as that affects our mood. Another guy comes and takes our beer and food orders. He takes a pretty long time to check on us after we receive our food, however another girl with tattoos made up for his lack of attention, but it's okay cause we're not that needy, just is nice to be asked how is everything tasting etc...  Calamari- 2.5/5 overly breaded so it hides the taste of the seafood itself Wings- 4/5 buffalo & spicy Korean sauces were pretty tasty, served with ranch or bleu cheese and celery Beerunch Burger- 5/5 beef patty, bacon, arugula, tomato, cheese, and egg on a brioche bun, served with tater tots.... SO good and tasty  Classic Cheeseburger- 4/5 beef patty, lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese, served w/steak fries  Ace Pineapple Cider- 5/5 suuuuper delicious, your True cider type of beer Bad Beat Bluffing Isn't Weisse- 5/5 \"it was bomb and tasted really good\" according to my bf, LOL.  The service needs some work, but thank goodness the food and venue makes up for it. Multiple tvs, booths, tables, high tops, bar seating, and patio seating. We wanna come back for the $23 bottomless booze brunch special- all you can drink beermosas, mimosas, or bloody marys paired with a breakfast item.",

We all ordered drinks and food. Maybe the waiter was new but there was a lot of confusion. First of all our drinks took a long time to come. Granted we were 12 people, but 20 minutes seem long.   After our drinks came, food took another 20 minutes to come. The place was not too packed, there were a bunch of empty tables, and we were the only big party there!  The food itself was pretty decent. I got the chicken sandwich and it was really good. Came with a side of crispy tator tots. I also tried the wedge salad and the margarita flatbread. The flatbread with really good. Loved the basil and the pesto sauce. Wedge salad is a wedge salad.   When the bill came, they gave us separate checks, which is awesome!  However, there was a lot of confusion because we were charged drinks that we either never ordered or never got. Some stuff got billed into other party's checks.   Food here is pretty good. The waiters we're really nice as well but food just took a long time to come and the bills should have been more organized.",

Several of the people at our table had asked Jay for beer recommendations and he did not lead us astray. There seemed to be a decent selection of local/craft beers which my friends seemed to like. Jay even pointed out a gentleman who was a local brewer and mentioned that some of them like to come in on occasion.  The drink prices were surprisingly good. Some of us got our checks back and were surprised that it didn't add up to more. This is a nice mellow spot to come drink with your friends, chop it up with the waiters, and munch on some decent food. I would say food is decent, but main reason you wanna come here is to try the various beers they have to offer.",

It would be great if something vegan could be on the menu. More and more people are switching to a plant based lifestyle and its a shame to miss that demographic. And I am sad that I won't frequent there as much.   Please being back a real vegan entre so that vegan and omnivores can all eat and drink and be merry together at your great restaurant!",

Well the the chicken street tacos apparently use the same chicken fingers I microwave for my kid. She loves them. Me I don't think they belong on adult food. Plus you shouldn't deep fry those things. Just my opinion it makes them dry and not tasty. The beer cheese nachos were a lot of chips and very little else. And the chips got harder as you reached deeper into the dish. We probably won't be returning here. But the hipsters and millennials were here in droves.  The second star is for our server, we told her about the tooth breaking chips and she deleted the item from our check.",

We got our food at least so that's good!  The burgers were excellent and a good deal. I don't know if I'll be back after the experience but don't let it deter ton from trying it out. I can't comment on the beer or selection because I lost out on that experience",

He was even honest on what beers he did not prefer and recommended an outstanding one for me based on what I liked.  Ask for samples. My wife never knew she liked infused beers.  We shared the pretzel (with cheese) and nachos (with chili). The pretzel was soft with a lovely outer crisp... and the size of my face! Plenty to share.  The Nachos never got soggy but was a little higher on the chip side of the chip-cheese ratio. But the chili was phenomenal. Hearty, not runny, and had chunks of succulent beef chunks.  All in all, this is s great place to bring a couple friends for some wonderful brews, eats, and service. Order from the shared menu, set the search list on the table-side iPad for your favorite style beer, and relax.",

The Bf ordered some type of beer that tastes like blueberry pancakes (which was amazing) and the bartender recommended a mule drink with ginger beer! It was so good! Ambiance was nice! Next time I'd come here with my girlfriends. As far as our main entree.. I ordered the Korean Bibimbap has no flavor at all, no sauce that went with veges the meat was flavorful. Bf got the steak with fries he loved it! But I would not recommend the Korean Bibimbap bowl. Other than that, We'd love to come back and try other beers and that fried Mac n cheese tho!",

The staff is always super friendly and efficient. The host always gets us seated quickly and the servers are extremely knowledgeable in the selection of beer they carry. They will help you find an impeccable brew to pair with your delicious meal. Our server even let me sample one of their sweeter beers and I swear that beer tasted just like a bowl of fruit loops! They have indoor and outdoor seating, plus a large beer and food menu so there's something for everyone to enjoy. Definitely recommend trying this place out if your in the henderson area.",

Lots on tap with tons in bottles and cans. If you can't find it here it may not exist. Having said that I was looking for the iconic Iron Maiden Trooper beer but they surprisingly didn't have it. No big deal. Lots of other options. I was just hoping to find it here.   Wings were solid. Being from Buffalo, I could prob teach them how to make a better sauce but all things being even, pretty good.   Then we took our beers on the patio and threw bean bags for an hour and a half. So much fun! Only downside was smokers coming out and ruining the air on the patio but otherwise, a great place with a fun atmosphere. Def be back soon!",

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my 4 month old and husband. I came in and the hostess was cleaning up tables. There was already a group of 3 waiting. I waited a few minutes then went to the hostess and asked her if we could have a table because the restaurant was half empty. From my perspective, customers are a priority when the restaurant is half empty with a ton of clean and open tables. The hostess told me she could not seat anyone because her boss told her she had to clean every table before she could seat anyone. So I asked her if I could speak to the manager. All I wanted to do was sit down at a table and wait, rather than standing in the entrance being ignored while staring at least 10 empty tables. The hostess said she can't get the manager because she is busy in the kitchen. Okay I understand the manager is likely always busy doing something, but regardless, I wanted to speak to them. I asked her so you're literally not going to let me speak to your manager? She said she's really busy in the kitchen and would not go get her. Hostess name was Alexis or some variation. I go to another employee at the bar and ask them to speak to the manager. The hostess goes up to the bar tender and then she finally goes and gets the manager. The manager, female pregnant and name starts with a 'P,' Puma or Pama. She walks up with the hostess, frown on face, to the group of us waiting for a table (2 more showed up) and she says \"which one\" and the hostess points at me. This manager doesn't introduce herself, she doesn't say hello, she literally says \"which one\" because she doesn't want to deal with me. I explain to her there are a ton of empty tables and you are telling your employee to ignore us because cleaning a few tables is more important than serving customers. She said we only have 2 servers right now and that we don't have the staff to seat you. I said ok then I'll be leaving and I asked her what her name was and then says \"my GM's name is Jeremy, tell him I say hi.\"  This is the type of people that this place chooses to employ? This is the type of manager you have running the place when the GM isn't present? I have never experience such shitty customer service at a restaurant without having even tasted the food. Happy to say I will never be trying this food.",

This place is spacious with dim lighting and heigh ceilings with plenty of seating (tables, high tops, bar, patio...). Lots of TV screens as well so a great bar for watching sports!   We arrived during Happy Hour, which had pretty decent offers: - Mon - Fri, 3P - 7P - Reverse HH Sun - Thurs, 10P - Close  - $4 draft beer selection - $5 appetizers  - $6 cocktails and wine   We shared some small bites - the Tavern Tots, Chimichurri Meatballs, and the Mac & Cheese. All tasty bar apps. My friend and I were such fatties we actually ended up ordering a second round of Tavern Tots. No regrets!  I got the Hefeweizen (Bad Beat Bluffing Isn't Weisse) for my first two drinks then switched over to the White Sangria. The Hef was excellent and the Sangria was refreshing.  Our server was great - water glasses were never empty and he stopped by to check on us frequently.   If this WOB wasn't on the other side of town from me I'd probably frequent more often. If I venture out for some shopping at Galleria Mall I'd definitely stop by to grab a beer!",

    "text": "Finally decided to give this place a try after trying to find a late night spot to get a drink and some food. For those of you who live out here in the Henderson area, things tend to shut down pretty quick during the week and there aren't too many choices that don't have slot machines in bedded in the bar tops to get some decent food and a cold beer.  We came here on a Wednesday night about an hour before closing and the bartender Matt was extremely gracious and kind.  Their beer list is exceptionally packed with variety and very good choices. Matt walked us through it and offered to give us any samples of anything we wanted. Also showed us the happy hour menu which was pretty impressive.  We decided to go with the tater tot nachos, not sure if that was the name but basically what they were, the wings and the mac and cheese bites.  The wings were pretty good. Meaty and juicy. I was a huge fan of the blue cheese sauce. I am more of a fan of the traditional chunky blue cheese but this was pretty tasty. Wings were not dry at all and refried to perfection. I'd give them a solid five out of five. We went with the traditional wings, but they do offer the boneless. And we went with the traditional buffalo style as well. Definitely a step above wing stop or any of the local bar and gaming places.  Tater tot nachos were definitely her favorite. Cheese sauce was typical, a little bit better than velveta unless it was velveta. Topped with bacon jalapenos chives and sour cream. Everything the heart needs to be happy. Another 5/5.  Last were the mac & cheese bites. I have to say these were not my favorite. Not sure what it was. Maybe the mac & cheese mix they used to make these lacked a little flavor or what. But they were good overall just didn't really pack a wow to them. I'd give them a 3/5.  Overall loved this place. Definitely would recommend this. Pretty cool that's part of the mall so you can do a little shopping it is before you had this place up.",

Haha i am not big beer drinker, but they had these fruits and ciders that were awesome! I can't exactly remember the name, but it was so good!!! It was a raspberry flavor! The beer was great, but the food was not all that. I wouldn't go their to get a meal, but to have a beer yes. Also the service is amazing!!!",

We were there about 15 / 20 minutes before our drink order was taken.  It took another 15 minutes or so for the drinks to come out.  It wasn't to long after we put our order in that it came out.  Mine was cold and the person who had chicken wings said he could cook better at home and they tasted awful (they were plain - nothing fancy).  He ended up leaving about half of them.   One had mac n cheese and said it was flavorless.  Though they knew we had a birthday (told them as well as gifts were unwrapped) we were bummed nothing was offered.  Most places offer some sort of dessert - even a bowl of ice cream would have been nice. I know I won't be back.",

I mean copious amounts of brew, cozy booths, TVs, and wings, it's a magnet for light colored jeans and stark white New Balance shoes. I slumped in here after enduring the pain of Macy's right after the Christmas holiday and needed to rest and maybe sip a few drinks.   The beer menu here is staggering, and there's a style for every beer palate, Belgium brews, Heffs, IPAs, 2xIPAs, Ciders, Seasonal Beers, Porters, and the list goes on. Thet also a have full menu filled with tasty bar food, for seven dollars you get a main dish and two sides. We went with fried chicken sliders, mac n' cheese and fries and also ordered a house salad for some green on the plate. The sliders were ok, but the mac n' cheese was gooey, cheesy and covered with a crunchy bread crumb top.  There's a full patio with tables, TVs, blocks for kids and a cornhole set. This place will be popular during the spring time and March Madness, so if you're headed to the mall and a hop-head check this place out ASAP.   P.S. - A Yelp check-in gets you a free beer!",

This is a great place for a spot of lunch or to watch a sports game. I have had a few menu items that are less than par, but today we had pretzel, margarita flatbread and chimay burger. All delicious.   Pua was our server and she was excellent. It's always a fun day at World of Beer. My only negative comment...on World Cup Qualifier games , they should open early!",

Atmosphere is very nice good place to go all year long.  Checked in with yelp and got the free local beer, tried other beers as well,  so many beers  too choose from. The food was ok had the meatballs, tater tots, fried pickles and a gigantic pretzel which was the best. Our bartender was ok she never asked how we were doing and it was hard to get her attention. Now for the bad part I had a piece of hair in my fried pickles,  the bartender replaced them but kept them on my check and I don't remember her apologizing for it.  The 4 stars are for everything else but the pickles",

The only complaint was with the bratwurst; it was good but the girth and size of the brat resembled a prepubescent boy. All together I would return.",

One bad server is all it takes to ruin a place for me. I won't be coming back here. Good place for beer, not for food.",

The waitress didnt tell her that there was bacon on it and she's a vegetarian.  It wasn't even in the description in the menu.  And the waitress didn't offer to exchange it and the bacon one was not taking off her receipt.  Weather in that will definitely go back to guest place very good atmosphere the food was good and we let our waitress pick our selection of beer for beer tasting and did a very good job",

Atmosphere: very chill. The setting is family friendly as well. They have couches. Some games on the patio that you can do. Pretty awesome!  Service:  our server was excellent. She was very attentive and she was always there when we needed her. if she wasn't around,  other servers, hostess and other staff made sure that we were doing ok and had everything we wanted/need. My friends came here with their toddler and the staff was so sweet playing with him.  Food and drinks: food are reasonable price and it's really good. Not greasy, perfect proportion. I liked what we ordered (which was burger) beers! Beers! Beers! I love it. They give you an iPad and you can view all the beers they have from all over the world; hence world of beer! Lol! Price is good too. You can sample all of them if your not sure what to get.  It's a must go place if you just want to relax. Away from the crowd on the strip! Good job Henderson for having this place!",

It took the server 10 minutes to let me know that they couldn't make the drink because they didn't have a Belgian Quad. I witnessed the bartender struggle to break a large bill for another customer while holding up a handful of other people waiting to order at the bar. Very subpar service.",
