The food is always delicious no matter what you get but what really makes this place shine is the impeccable service EVERYONE gives. Love the unlimited fresh chips, salsa and beans they bring out when you sit down. You could probably get full on just those but save some room for the main course! Highly recommend the 1-3 item combination plate where you can have a choice of several items plus soup, rice and those yummy beans. Also top on the list is their namesake Flaming Fajitas, which True to the name, they light on fire tableside before serving! Forget the fancy, overpriced, sub-par service restaurants on the strip and come here for your fix!",

This place is awesome!  Chips were great and not greasy, I love the complimentary grilled veggies and they even tossed in fideo soups for both my son and I (it usually only comes with an entree at other places and I ordered the app nachos and he the kid's meal). Service was really exceptional. Omar waited on us and there was also another lady that really took care of us. Drinks were filled without being asked and dirty plates were taken away without being noticed. I had mentioned it was my first time and Omar brought us churros at the end of the meal!   Food was great and portions plenty. I ate about a third of my nachos and the kiddo didn't finish his kids meal either. I really digged the environment,  decor and murals too. Considering this used to be a no-frills BBQ place, they really amped up the Mexican theme. The flaming fajitas tableside really added to the fun of the whole place and we enjoyed being wowed when others ordered it.  Juan's is def my new neighborhood spot for Mexican.",

(grilled onions and jalapenos were also provided.) while it did take a little time for the food to arrive we had fun enjoying the atmosphere and the kids liked watching them make fresh tortillas. we of course ordered a flaming fajita plate, which was impressive and delicious but the rest of us couldn't resist ordering from the happy hour menu, which was impressively inexpensive and incredibly filling (maybe partly because you can almost eat your entire dinner with the bean and salsa dips?). they also provide complimentary soup, which is like a tomato-based soup with rice (the kids loved it), and we all left with to-go boxes! they do have tv's all around tuned into sports if that's something that you're into but a slight draw-back since we had young kids and a couple of the tv's were showing a pretty graphic boxing match.   i'd definitely come here again and if we were locals we'd probably be regulars!",

Plenty of parking, short wait for the rest of our group to arrive so I had a mango margarita at the bar. We were seated immediately when our party arrived and the parade of deliciousness started arriving starting with the chips, salsa, and received beans. I'm not sure if some in our party requested grilled onions and jalapenos with the chips and salsa or if it's a regular thing that comes with, but do yourself a favor and order it! We also got the table side guac which was great. The highlight, obviously are the fajitas! Tip: if you're getting an appetizer, soup, or multiple baskets of chips and salsa, order the fajitas for one. It comes in a Dutch oven type pot with a burner underneath and they literally light the thing on fire before placing on the table(fire out before hitting the table but burner underneath still lit, so watch little hands).  We made the mistake of ordering the fajitas for two and we had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Great place, prompt friendly service, now I know why everyone I talk to recommends the place! We'll definitely be back and will bring newbies with us too!",

    "text": "I finally tried out JFF! The parking lot was packed when we arrived, so I worried we might have to wait long for a table. Nope! Just a couple minute wait and we were on our way. Soon chips, salsa and bean dip were at our table. They also brought a side of grilled veggies! The salsa was alright, but could have been thicker for my preference. The bean dip was very good as were the chips. Our server mentioned they have excellent guacamole made table-side. The guac sounded good and I would be the only one trying it so, I asked for the small side priced at $3.95 on the menu. The small side of guacamole was not made table-side so I didn't get to choose any of the ingredients that went into the guac. It was just brought to the table already prepared. I didn't like it at all. it was just bland mashed avocados with way to many tomatoes in it. I would have liked some onion, jalapeno, salt and maybe even some lime, but I wasn't offered any. The kicker for me was when my food arrived and there was about the same amount of the same exact bland guacamole on my plate that I paid extra for prior. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered the other, but the server also said it would be made table-side and to my customization.  My friend and I ordered \"Combo Fajitas For Two\" priced at $25.95 with beef and pork. This comes with a cup of \"Fideo Soup\" that is out of this world yummy. The soup really packed some delicious flavor. One thing that impressed me here is that a lot of the time when you order fajitas somewhere it usually is just meat and tortillas, but they actually gave a small side of sour cream, bland guacamole, pico de gallo and you can choose flour or corn tortillas. The meal also came with rice and beans that were very good. The fajitas were so-so for me. The meat is thicker than I am used to and was a bit tough and the bell peppers were still to raw and not cooked enough. My hubby ordered his own combo plate that had Chile Relleno and a Cheese Enchilada and thought it was good, but nothing to write home about. There were major hits and misses with the whole meal. Our server was very friendly and checked on us often. It was worth at least giving it a try! Will I come back? Not anytime soon, but I can see giving JFF another shot at some point maybe with a coupon.  When you walk in the dining area is on the right and there is a cantina towards the left.

Huge portion sizes on the meals too ! Make sure to check for he happy hour drinks and check in offers to get some smoking deals ! Pro tip -  Always make sure to budget time to be seated during dinner time each time I have had to wait about 20 minutes during peak times to get a table - check to see if you can make a reservation-  but the wait is worth it !",

For my meal, I ordered the flaming chicken fajitas with corn tortillas and devoured my entire serving of fajitas.

My first thought ... there's no way they're closing at 9 !!  Happy to say the food was amazing. Flaming table side beef and shrimp fajitas were the best I've had in Vegas. Service was impeccable. Guacamole was as good as my own (and that's a very good thing!). My advice ... run to Juan's. Yes ... right now !! I'm a foodie and I wouldn't post this if it wasn't 100% True!!",

My first time stop at Juan's iinvolved  a Friday happy hour and I was enthralled from the start. The happy hour menu is outstanding from beer to margaritas it has something for everyone that enjoys a cocktail. With Juan's not only do you get incredible chips and salsa they also give you fried onions and jalapenos which are a prefect complement with a cocktail since the jalapenos have some heat! It goes without saying the number one menu item to try are the fajitas! Chicken, beef or shrimp it does not matter they are all superb. I have eaten at Juan's approximately fifteen times and it has been fantastic everytime. Put Juan's at the top of your must try list!",

We came here on a Saturday around lunch time. There was a wait for seating, with a few customers ahead of us. So we opted for a table at the bar where we were promptly seated.   The server quickly came to take our drink order, which consisted of a water and a small house margarita on the rocks. The margarita came out quickly. Overall, the service throughout our meal was swift & friendly.   Complimentary chips with 2 types of salsa (red and green) and beans quickly followed. I enjoyed the red salsa. They also serve complimentary grilled jalapenos and onions. Awesome!  They were a bit salty, but I like it nonetheless.   We ordered the chile Colorado and the flaming chicken fajitas. Both came with sope de fideo soup (noodle soup). The noodles were thick like spaghetti and there were small bits of tomato. It was okay - not my favorite version of the soup.   The chile Colorado was okay, nothing outstanding. The flaming chicken fajitas were set aflame table side-this is what sets this Mexican restaurant apart from its fellow competitors. When I order fajitas I like 2 things 1) flavor to the meat and 2) a selection of veggies. Most fajitas have bland meat, requiring me to lime down my fajitas. These fajitas weren't bland, which I was happy about. They came with red & green peppers and onions. Not overly zealous on the veggies, but I like when I get red bell peppers so yay! for this. The fajita menu also offers lettuce wraps in lieu of tortillas.",

Food: Husband ordered the Carne Asada burrito. It was excellent and he cleaned his plate. I ordered a combo with a Chile relleno and a cheese enchilada.  It was good, but nothing special. So, knocked off a star since it was just ok. Didn't like that the cheese used in the relleno didn't melt.   I'd definitely come back and try the fajitas. They looked amazing.",

Few TVs in bar area, great selection in the bar for drinks, but we had margaritas. Very good standard margaritas.  My girl had the Huge burrito with French Fries in it. She said it was really good (it looked great). And I'm one for visiting new places and trying what they advertise... Fajitas of course!!! The steak fajitas are so good and the Presentation when they are brought out, wow oh wow cool!   I wanted a nice spicy sauce but all they delivered weren't very good ( for my taste). Everyone else must like them.   The guy that waited on us seemed like he was really into himself. Like everyone walked in wanting him. Kinds cocky but whatever. Good luck with that.

Hernan, our waiter, was very attentive and checked on us every 7-10 minutes to make sure everything was perfect.

In an act of desperation and pure genius, she phoned me and asked if I knew of a great Mexican restaurant in the area. It just so happened that I had bookmarked Juan's a few days earlier and deciding to to put my faith in my fellow Yelpers, we headed over... And once again, my Yelp compadres, you did NOT disappoint.  As soon as my mother and I opened the door we were greeted. This is a large space, with a separate bar and patio area (which pleases me because I don't have to sit near children - no offense to you parents out there). We were seated at a table and were greeted within 15 seconds. Needless to say, the serve was on point all night. My iced tea was never more than half full the entire night.  Chips and salsa and bean dip came out immediately, quickly followed by grilled peppers and onions.Then we got a cup of the sopa de fidello.  Being the avocado lover I am, I had to gets my guacamole on; Juan's make theirs table side with fresh cilantro, tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions. You really can't mess up guac, it was a total win. Fresh to death.   My mother and I wanted to see what these Flamingo Fajitas were all about. We ordered the fajitas for 2 (priced around $23), steak and chicken combo. It came with a side of rice and beans, as well as more guac (there is no such thing as too much guac), pico de gallo, and sour cream. The fajitas came out, our server set the tray done and lite that bad boy on FIY-AH! It was awesome. The fajitas were then placed on the table and we devoured them. The meat was perfectly season as were the onions and peppers. DELICIOSO!!! Some of the best fajitas I've ever had. This entree actually served three and we had left overs.  We didn't have room for dessert so we skipped that. All in all, the hole in my mom's heart has been filled. Juan's delivered. Great food, great service. I am a fan. I cannot wait to go back and try their other entrees. Ole!",

We will definitely be back and will ALWAYS request to sit in Amanda's section! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up and a thank you very much.

For meals, my boyfriend and I had the shrimp enchiladas and the pollo asada tacos. Both were absolutely delectable! Each entree came with a Mexican soup as well as beans and rice on the side.

We were a party of 5 and immediately greeted as soon as we sat down. Chips and salsa (both delicious and fresh) were served within seconds. We ordered both chicken and steak fajitas and they were seriously some of the best I have ever had! Very hot and flavorful. Loved that they were served on a sizzling platter lit by fire from the waiter. Great show! Additionally we had the pleasure of listening to live music provided by the roaming guitar playing musician. He was wonderful and even took our requests and sang to our table! Perfect! Our waiter Gustavo was a \"10\" in terms of service and professionalism. Definitely worth every cent of our 20+% tip! We never waited for refills or plates to be removed. He was very prompt, polite and attentive. Our party agreed that we would be back again SOON!! Give this place a try! You will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "THE FOOD LIVES UP TO THE REVIEWS!  They are a long way from my house, almost 40 miles round trip. Which is why we waited so long to try it. Nothing fancy or like interior authentic, just really good food and plenty of it.  The chips and salsas are tasty but the grilled onions and jalapenos take the whole amuse bouche (sorry don't know the Spanish term) to another level. The Sopa de Fideo reminds me of Texas in the 60s.  The shrimp ceviche was so fresh tasting and a huge portion. I will need to tweak the Margarita Martini a little to get it where it needs to be but they have Bohemia; absolutely the best Mexican beer by far and harder and harder to find Outwest.  My GF ordered the Chile Relleno. Now a short discourse on that dish; it should be made with a Poblano chile that has been roasted and peeled NOT deep fried and peeled. An Anaheim or long green is too mild and somewhat insipid tasting, deep frying leaves the pepper al dente. Even though picadillo is also traditional filling, I prefer cheese with a thick but fluffy batter. A light red sauce and some queso leaves you with a 9 out of 10 relleno!  I had the green chile burrito enchilada style (an homage to the Jungle Club/El Jardin) and a cheese enchilada (because I am from Texas). The enchilada sauce was darker than I usually like, a little bitter but really tasted homemade and the enchilada was great!  Rice and beans are well above average and the service was excellent. $60.00 for 3 beers, a $9.95 Margarita, a huge appetizer, and 2 combination plates. Living La Vida Loca!",

    "text": "3.75 stars.   Because of past experiences with other large party-friendly, expansive \"Mexican\" menu, margarita-obsessed restaurants (*cough* El Torito, Acapulco *cough*), I almost dreaded having dinner there.   I expected watered down, over-saccharine drinks, bland meat, weak salsas, and to eat my weight in tortilla chips.  What we got were surprisingly good margaritas (even the happy hour one I ordered for the first round, nicely charred sizzling meat and juicy shrimp, and a trio of dips to include two tasty salsas and a dip bean that ensured I would still eat my weight in tortilla chips.   Let's back up to the margaritas. Happy Hour margaritas are usually 99% margarita mix and have no strength. They're also usually some ridiculous price like $2. The HH drinks here come in at around $6 on average, but actually have some body to them. I was surprised to find that even the flavored selections didn't wuss out. That said, on round two, I opted for a full-priced spicy watermelon margarita. It was an extra $2 well spent.   The food exceeded my expectations. A first timer should definitely order the flaming fajitas. Aside from the name of the place practically telling you to, you should do this if for nothing else than the sheer spectacle that is the meat arriving on a round custom \"JFFC\" grill. Said grill is then set on fire causing an eruption of flames at such heights that I wonder how many servers have lost their eyebrows as part of regular dinner service. Come on, man. It's in the name.   My husband and I ordered the combo fajitas for two and opted for steak and shrimp. Oh, yeah. If you have an eating partner, are a greedy face, or like to eat dinner leftovers by yourself for a few meals after, get the combo. It just looks cool. Bigger is better, right (yay, 'Murica?).   My only squabbles on the food would be that the number of shrimp provided and the sides. The portion of shrimp provided for maybe 2.5 per fajita if you used 3 tortillas for the meal. As for the sides, if you're going to the tex-mex, gringo-leaning menu, then cover the beans in cheese. Smother those things. Yeah, yeah. I know I'm Asian and well on my way to lactose-intolerance, but I love my cheese-covered beans.   Aside from that, service was just okay. I didn't get the impression that our server cared much for us, but perhaps it was because it was a Thursday and he was as over the week as the rest of us. He gets a pass.   Based on the scene when I arrived, I would suggest making reservations. When we arrived at about 5:15pm, the lobby area was packed and wait times were at around 25 minutes. Luckily for me, this experienced was skipped thanks to folks from our party having arrived early to snag a table.  Anyway, does this place suck? No. Is it like the El Toritos and Acapulcos of the world? It's a better, upgraded version. Is it the best Mexican food in Vegas? Not by a long shot.   But I'm not mad at it.",

For being a Friday night, the place was crowded but we were sat instantly. The place is decent size with tons of tvs around the entire restaurant. We ordered the steak & shrimp fajitas for two and shared the colada de guava drink. That drink was so delicious it could have been a dessert. While you wait they bring you chips, two salsas, bean dip, grilled onions & peppers and sopa. Our food was brought out as soon as we were finishing up our soup. And it's called Juan's FLaming Fajitas bc they pour liquor on top and light it up table side. Hence, the flaming. The fresh in house made tortillas were amazing and so was everything else. The portions are huge. We had to force ourselves to finish. For the price & portion size I will definitely be back. The negative one star is because there needs to be more ventilation from all the fajitas, it was very Smokey and stuffy. Be prepared to smell like fajitas after you eat here.",

Wait: Half hour on a Thursday, not shocking because of a handsome amount of good reviews. Be prepared to wait even more on a weekend.   Little things I noticed: the ladies at the front were wiping the menus after being handed over by the staff inside. I appreciate this GREATLY. Good job!   Service: Callie was our waitress for the night and she was attentive and polite. Everyone else who swung by our table to serve drinks, starters and food were absolutely welcoming. Good vibes all round.   Starters: The complimentary starters were cool and a welcoming sight to one who is famished waiting outside for half an hour. Soup was tasty, as was the chips and dip! Loved the side of grilled peppers and onion. Yum.   Now here comes the part I am sadly iffy about:  Table-side Guacamole: Always fun to see someone make your guac fresh. Nothing like fresh guac.   Partner had the pork carnitas to which he said it was bland, given the amount of sides he had. He felt there was no flavour or kick to it despite hauling all the goodies in the tortilla.   Baja fish tacos: batter was so-so on the fish, but what irked me was the slaw. Very confusing on the palette and didn't merge the taco together. Was very sad.  Does one return? On the fence. With the amount of reviews perhaps one came in on the wrong night. Willing to try again. Any recommendations for a good Mexican joint are welcome our way.   Sorry Juan, we really wanted to like your fajitas. Maybe next time.",

So here's the scoop, Saturday night busy of course, looks like a hole in the wall, don't be put off by that, don't be put odd with the 30 to 45 minute wait either, it's worth it I promise. 1st wow factor the table is set with our menus chips & salsas, with bean dip and peppers at the table before we even sit down, impressed already. The server is there mere minutes later taking our drink order. Order Manuel Margaritas it was yum, fresh lime and fresh orange juice delightful. I have a sensitive tummy so though I love margaritas I can usually only have 1 before the acid reflux hits, they put some magic fairy dust in there cuz I had two and I'm good! But I digress, the food, ok, our thought process is you go to place with Fajitas in there name, you should probably try the Fajitas, they don't disappoint. They have a deal for two, we highly recommend we're stuffed and had a hefty doggie bag. So many goods, homemade tortillas, soaps before the meal, the guacamole fire, the roasted peppers, just wow. But the biggest wow is the staff, the wait staff so attentive and knowledgeable about their product, but the bus staff we were so impressed, the hardest working bus staff, they had tables cleaned and ready to go in minutes. All the staff really, Mo the manager chatted with us for a bit to check in our experience, they have something special here for sure, we'll be back!",

Table side guacamole is cool!  Juan's also has an amazing happy hour every day and daily specials (each day is different so check out their website). The day we were there it was 15% off for Veterans ( That is Awesome!!!! Thank you!!!)  Plenty of parking. Weekends get crazy busy so beware.  Yelpers get $5 off their $50, or more, purchase!",

I was slightly concerned about how far away the restaurant was from our hotel on the strip, but the short drive was well worth it.   The meal began with with free chips and salsa with a few other additions (Bean dip, fried jalapeno, and grilled onions). All of it was delicious. We also decided to order the large guacamole and an order of queso. Both of our appetizers were excellent and came quickly.   After a few minutes reviewing the menu, my wife and I decided to get the steak fajitas for two, smothered in Monterey Jack cheese. The restaurant is known for lighting the fajitas on fire table side, which was really neat. The jack cheese was a perfect combo with the steak. The steak was cooked perfectly and was high quality meat.  Service during the meal was excellent. The staff was very attentive and stopped by the table frequently to refill beverages and check in. Omar was our server and we enjoyed his service.   The restaurant and bathroom facilities were very clean. Overall, an excellent experience and I will definitely return.",

I was a little nervous ordering the rest of my food because I definitely didn't want to get sick. I asked if someone else could come by my table to help me with my order, which they did. Food came out in a timely manner and it was really good",

We ordered some drinks, most of us enjoyed ours but my uncle didn't enjoy the Moscow mule he got. He kept saying it wasn't made right but he didn't enjoy mine either so he could possibly make his differently. My family ordered two orders of the combo fajitas for two with all four meat choices while I ordered the pollo asado burrito. My parents really enjoyed the steak, shrimp and chicken fajitas. The pollo asado burrito I had was to die for! I ate the entire burrito and I normally can't eat half, but was so enjoyable I wanted to finish it. I will definitely be back!",

The service was great--very quick. There were also so many 'freebies'! Chips, red salsa, green salsa, and warm bean dip all come with the meal, as well as free sopa de fideos. The green salsa was amazing, but the beans were not as flavorful as Ricardo's. I ordered the guava magarita (virgen/slushie only) and the chicken fajitas. The margarita was absolutely delicious! It tasted very fresh and was the perfect amount of sweetness. The fajitas were the best I've ever had--and they arrived with a show (they set them ablaze at your table)! Jesse ordered the Tex-Mex shredded beef enchiladas and enjoyed those as well (but the fajitas are where it's at!). The atmosphere was chill. Sports were playing on the TV's. Overall, it was great (aside from the rice and beans being on the bland side). A great (BIG) meal for a good price. I'll definitely go back!",

Located at the end, tucked in a strip mall, but ample parking. Fajitas are their specialty, seasoned beef, chicken, shrimp, pork or a combo, served on fire in a caldron with sides of refried or black beans salsa, guacamole and tortillas - husband god the steak said it was delicious. Friends got the chimmy stuffed with steak fajita, they also had some Jalisco specialties which you could order any protein (chicken, steak, fish or shrimp) and they had different combinations of sauces/vegetable specialties such as cactus, chipotle/cream/wine sauce, mole poblano, Vallarta sauce with capers and peppers, a chili/poblano cream and Monterey cheese sauce - these are great. They have an extensive menu including appetizers (excellent ceiviche), salads, soups....typical line up of enchiladas, tamales, burritos, chimmy's, combo plates. Go for their specialties of fajitas or off their Jalisco plates, u can't go wrong. Services are excellent.",

Depending on who the cook is or how or what you order can determine the number of stars I'd give. At an overall rating for price , food quality and timely ness I give it 4 stars. Juan and Alex behind the bar are both great bartenders.   Pros : good happy hour             Bar/ TVs/ Machines             Patio             You can switch out your rice or beans for veggies  Cons : if you go to Juan's during busy hours there's a chance it could be really packed    If you have to be at work or somewhere you'd rather not smell like fajita smoke save this occasion for another time  Parking can be a bit of a challenge",

    "text": "Me and my mom were hearing so many good things about this place that we were dying to try it. With so many great reviews we thought we'd love it, unfortunately this place was a disappointment.  The wait was expected to be a lil long as it was dinner time and it actually went by really fast the only down part is this place is so small and there's barely anywhere to wait to be seated. Good thing it was only about a 20 min wait. Chips and salsa came with beans and grilled chile and onion which was good.  We ordered margaritas blended and they were so watery. Good but not frozen.  Plates come with Fideo soup which the noodles were overcooked and mushy.  We ordered chile Verde plate and this is where the most disappointment stood, the pork was extremely tough as it had not been cooked long enough.  My jaws hurt after from biting into the hard meat. The sauce was so runny and watery that my rice and beans were soaked in a plate of sweet green sauce.  Not so appetizing eating soggy rice.  Our waitress was nice checked on us a little too much, you know seeming like we were being rushed out. We felt as in hurry up and eat and get out so we can get others in.  Very uncomfortable.  There was a gentleman cleaning the table next to us and he was sweeping like a mad man saying \"little kids\" over and over as he swept up the floor banging the brooms on the highchairs shaking his head. Also uncomfortable when ur sitting enjoying your meal.  I'm not sure if this was just a busy night, which I wouldn't be surprised as to every night is, but we held high standards for  this place and we weren't impressed. We will stick to Pancho's! Maybe give another shot in the future...",

Then of course, their fajitas are amazing in every way. They also have a great house Sangria you should try. Every visit the food is the exact same great quality, every single time. The same is True of the service. Even if there is a wait to be seated, once you are sat, the food comes out within 20 minutes. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I take them to Juan's, not only because I know they'll have a great time and a great meal, but it gives me an excuse to feed my addiction!",

    "text": "Everything was pretty damn good! I might have to say those were the absolute best fajitas I've ever had, and their presentation was pretty cool to boot. Two things I think could be improved, one: check on your tables a little more often (everyone was extremely friendly and very accommodating, I just would have liked to have my drink refilled w/out having to flag someone down) and second: the lights were very dim and the ceiling fans were going a little slow creating a very odd effect of making all of us dizzy; had to walk to several tables before finding something acceptable to dine at. Mind you I was pretty tired but I've never had that happen and I think it could have been avoided by either turning the lights up or even down a little bit more. Could have just been an odd occurrence but everyone in my party complained about it as well. Wish we had saved room to try the desserts because if the entrees are this amazing I bet the sweets are just as good! I would recommend this place to everyone...give it a shot!",

    "text": "First of all, I would just like to point out the fact that this place has not been open very long. Maybe a year or two, max. I remember it being a barbecue place, with that said, it has more reviews than other Mexican restaurants I was looking to take my husband to for his birthday. So, to me it says something that a place that hasn't been established long has so many great reviews.  Service- everyone there is very friendly and go above and beyond. Example- we brought our 17 month old and after seating him a lady brought out a drawing game for him to play with, this ended up being a lifesaver!!!!! I also saw her bring one out for an older boy, as well as the standard coloring paper and crayon. Everything came out very fast and was a pleasant experience.  Food- the chips, bean dip and salsa were good! They literally bring it to you as your seated! The sopa de fideo is so tasty even my picky toddler gobbled it up!!  My husband and I both ordered a 3 item plate, chicken tacos, beef flautas, and cheese enchilada. The beef was shredded and moist and oh so tasty, I didn't make it to my taco, but it was generous in size and my husband said his was great. The enchilada comes with red or green sauce, which to me can make or break the enchilada. The green sauce was very good and so was the red. The portions are HUGE so expect leftovers. We ordered the churro, even though the server recommended the fried ice cream, now I wish I had gotten that. The churro wasn't really anything special. Not something is get again, bit hey, I don't typically have room for dessert at a Mexican place, so it doesn't knock off any stars in my book.  The place has happy hour every day and it's not crowded at all...yet, although the way the reviews are going I'm sure it will get there.",

Both were perfect; very flavorful. We liked the chips, salsa and bean dip served as soon as we sat (included with the meal.  All in all, a very good lunch.

I ordered the mole inchelada which I could tell the chicken was pre-cooked and overlooked. Why are you guys wasting sour cream and lettuce? Nobody eats that, I could of gotten an extra enchilada for what was wasted in lettuce. I went with a party of five, I can tell the cook needs major improvement you can tell that none of the food is fresh. And for the price per plate I rather go to Denny's. I don't see this restaurant open when their lead is over. The Ambience is dead boring, the manager took the waiters check which I don't approve of because I have worked in the restaurant business. The place can use a touch up, and I can save the owner more money Nd put more quality in the food myself. The French fries and chicken fingers my kids for we're just plain crap they didn't even eat them because it was so gross.  Cut back on the waste, fix the lighting. Have some Mexican music playing, make me feel like I'm in Mexico for some real Mexican food. Not some microwaved feel dinner, no offense. I give it two stars because the mole sauce was good that's it.",

The food was excellent, starting with the chips, salsa and bean starter. Along with that trio , came a wonderful grilled onions and peppers combo. That was the first time I've ever witnessed that accompany chips and salsa. My family and I felt it was necessary to try the dish the restaurants namesake is, fajitas. We ordered the combo chicken and beef, and they were excellent. Full of flavor, neither the beef nor chicken was dry. The portion was plentiful. The fajitas were accompanied with rice and re fried beans. The rice was soft and flavorful and the beans perfectly seasoned. My first experience was excellent all around. The service was attentive the moment we sat down until we said thank you and goodbye. I will return and make sure I inform anyone who hasn't dined there to give it a try.",

Venny and Alex. Being in the bar industry, I have high expectations and they more than fulfill and satisfy every need of mine and their other patrons. I am very observant and always come by myself so I can't help but watch how attentive others are with their guests. They are AMAZING! Always on top of it. If they're not charming their guests, they are cleaning or preparing wonderful drinks. Two of my favorite bartenders in Vegas, hands down!",

    "text": "Thank you, Shirley B, for choosing Juan's Flaming Fajitas for your birthday celebration. If not for you, I probably wouldn't have made it to this place. I also probably wouldn't have developed an obsession with homemade flour tortillas, either! Yes, it's that good, and I can't stop thinking about it...  Okay, concentrate Suzy. Let's write about the other awesome stuff:  Service. The water/sodas were filled continuously throughout our meal. Endless warm chips, salsa, and delicious bean dip were replenished quickly. Too quickly! Food delivery was speedy, too. Shirley B & Terri R both brought outside desserts and the staff was more than happy to supply the candles we forgot (oops!) and present it with an enthusiastic birthday song and sombrero for the birthday girl! Awesome, friendly, and efficient staff!  Value. I don't frequent Mexican restaurants very much, but I think it's a great deal. All entrees include unlimited chips/salsa, fideo soup, choice of vegetables or rice/beans. Our party ordered the infamous fajitas. Get the combo if you're sharing, it's definitely worth the price. Even the other items, such as the big bowl of pozole my boyfriend ordered was only $4.95.   Food Taste: I've had the shrimp fajitas. Big shrimps! My party loved them and Chad S loved his carne asada burrito. We've returned back a 2nd night and we ordered the Dulce De Leche Fried Ice Cream. Yum! We have to go back to try their Sopapillas, for sure!  Homemade Flour Tortillas. (Yes, it's that good) I've been a deprived girl who hadn't been exposed to authentic tortillas very often. From now on, I'll be comparing future flour tortillas to Juan's. And yes, I know, if you're eating authentic Mexican food, you're supposed to be eating corn tortillas. But I can't help it, I love them! Served piping hot, it's so delicious that you can just eat it by itself. Or with a bit of their bean dip. It's worth the drive just for these. I'm planning my next trip there as I write this...  There's TVs to watch the game, decently clean restrooms, and has a very festive atmosphere like most good Mexican joints. Come here for your next fajita fix. But bring me back more tortillas. ;)",

The front waiting area is a tight squeeze and a lot of foot traffic of people coming in and out. Once we were seated we were greeted with bean dip, two types of salsas, and chips. Our waiter came really fast before we even looked at the menus, but my kids knew they wanted horchata. They thought it was just okay. I had the guava colada and my husband had the sangria. Both drinks were decent, but we've had better. The food portions were large enough to share, but since it was our first time we all wanted our own dish. They had a live musico who my kids enjoyed listening to. Our food came out fairly fast and it was good. We'll try it again!",

    "text": "Happy Birthday, Tita Shirley B!!    For now on when I think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas, I going to think about Shirley B's Birthday celebration. It was Shirley's pick to come here.  And when people asked her why Juan's for her birthday, her response was \"because it's MY birthday\".  I agree with your choice, Tita.  Juan's was a great dinner.    One thing I love about fajitas in general is that you can chose to make it a high calorie meal or a low calorie meal.  It really all depends how many fajitas you plan on demolishing and what you put in it.  But Juan's is more than just their infamous flaming fajitas, right?  Sure it is.  At Juan's there's a huge selection of Mexican dishes and by the looks at everyone's orders around the restaurant, the dishes are definitely hooked up.  Review their menu...you got burrito options, taco concoctions, salads, nachos, ensaladas, soups, chimichangas, and of course, fajitas.  But before I even talk about their main dishes, I have to mention their bottomless tortilla chips.  My goodness, it should be a crime that these are bottomless.  The chips didn't even have a chance.  After multiple chip refills (i.e. 9 basket of chips), I came to the conclusion that their tortilla chips are addicting.  I swear, they should rename this place to Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Tortilla Chips.  Just saying.   Everyone on our table, with the exception of Chad S and Mr B (aka Shirley's husband), got the fajitas.  I didn't try Chad's Carne Asada Burrito, but was able to sample some of Mr. B's Steak Taquitos.  The taquitos are bigger than most. It's was more like a mini-chimichanga if you ask me.  Terri and I shared the steak & chicken fajita combo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=l3lS7rPzGYQukY10aqTMSQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).  This is huge, feeds two, and was served flaming.  Yup...this was one good dish.  Both the steaks and chicken were seasoned, properly cooked, tender, and fresh.  Hard for me to describe, but their fajitas is pretty much as good as it gets.    As for their service, I thought that it was pretty good considering how busy the place was.  The restaurant is decently sized with the bar on one side and the main dining area in another.  Both had one thing in common...tons of TV's from every angle.  Yeah buddy!!  Not missing sports at this restaurant.  Our server was Juan.  No joke.  We had Juan, not THE Juan, you know the one.  He was great and treated us like we were his only customers.  It's like Juan on One.  Hah!  All joking aside, Juan was great.  By the way, there's 3 other Juan's working here too.  I bet you can't find that anywhere.  I wonder if I go to Mel's Diner would I find 3 other Mel's.  I bet not.    Juan's allowed us to take our own desert, which consisted of Hello Kitty cupcakes and an Niner/Hello Kitty Birthday Cake.  All for Shirley B.  Juan and the staff at Juan's brought the deserts to our table while singing Happy Happy Birthday to Shirley B.    Overall...fajitas and a lot of sugar with friends equals a great time.  Happy Birthday, Shirley B!  Go Niners!!!

Chips, salsa and guacamole were very good. I really do not have a lot of bad things to say, but I was really not impressed. The service was good, the atmosphere are price are excellent! Fajitas, rice, beans, guacamole and sopa de fideos with two choices of meat for just 24 dollars! It really sounds like a good deal.",

They will always put on Pittsburgh sports for us, even though I am pretty sure they aren't Pittsburgh fans.  I really like that they have a vegetarian menu, but last time we were in there, the waiter told us the fideo is made with chicken broth (I knew that) and so is the rice (I didn't know that). I mostly don't worry about stuff like broth when it comes to Mexican food, but I do think they need to either tell people or get it out of the rice, because it's a little misleading to call it vegetarian when it isn't. On the other hand, I did ask Juan once if they'd ever consider tofu or fake meat for the fajitas and he told me if I brought some in, they'd try it in ours. I'm not sure if I'm going to do that, but it was nice that he offered!",

Food is amazing and the staff is awesome.  The only thing that's a little annoying is if you eat inside, everything you bring in will smell like fajitas  but that can be easily solved by eating outside. I also noticed the smell wasn't so bad when we ate in the bar area. I still love this place but wear things you can wash easily!",

    "text": "Some of my family came here for dinner when we were visiting my uncle. Despite the great Yelp reviews, this place was not really busy on a Saturday night. That might have been because it was a long weekend but it was fine as our part of 7 got seated immediately. From the moment we walked in, the service was really friendly and excellent.  They give you bean dip, salsa, and chips to start. The chips were okay; the salsa was good but pretty spicy, and the bean dip was a nice alternative to the spiciness of the salsa. The drinks are really reasonably priced (like $5-6 for margaritas and less for beers) and looked good although I didn't order anything. The menu is pretty extensive and has a ton of options. Everything we ordered looked awesome and what I tried was really good. They light the fajitas \"on fire\" which is a nice presentation. More importantly, I tried some of my mom and brother's fajitas and they were really well seasoned and perfectly cooked. My cousin had one of the platos, shrimp with the mojo de ajo. He liked it a lot but I found it way too spicy.   I had the enchiladas de mole. I liked my dish, but I found the mole sauce a bit disappointing. I think it had peanut butter in it did not compare to other mole sauces I have had. A bit too heavy and sweet, but it was alright with sour cream and I liked the chicken inside it a lot.   Based solely on my dish, I would probably give this place 4 stars but I think it definitely deserves 4.5 based on the other stuff I tried, and I round up because of the service. They have a little stage so I assume they have live music from time to time and their happy hour looks good also. I would come back again when visiting my uncle.",

    "text": "Had heard and read a lot of great things about the eatery - and since our family is a big fan of Mexican food, we were eager to give it a try.   Didn't have to wait long for a table, despite the fact that the waiting area was crowded. Once seated, chips, salsa, bean dip and a (kind of weird - what do you do with this??) plate of grilled onions and jalapenos were promptly delivered to the table. Our drink orders were also taken. Then, the \"chip guy\" inquired whether we'd like more bean dip, and quickly brought over an additional four bowls. Seemed a bit like overkill, but OK.   But then, nothing ... for about eight minutes. No one came to take orders. Our waiter noticed (finally) that we were ready to order, but said he'd be back in a moment. We ordered chicken tacos off the combination menu, a kids' enchilada and chicken asado tacos. All came with bowls of fideo soup, which was on the bland side (and mine was hardly warm).   We also ordered the queso fundito appetizer. Don't bother: It's a lump of melted cheddar (not in a good way, but a stringy, difficult to eat way) with a few tomatoes and onions mixed in. Thank goodness it was discounted for happy hour (as was the strawberry margarita we ordered - good price, but nothing to write home about) or I would have been REALLY disappointed.   Overall, the quality of the entrees was just OK - much better than the salsa/beans and queso, thankfully. I just wasn't as blown away by the flavor as I'd expected to be based on all of the terrific things I'd heard. The food was pretty run-of-the-mill. The service from everyone (with the exception of the the chip guy, who was top-notch) was spotty throughout.   Will we return for another meal? My spouse answered that best: \"If Lindo Michoacan is ever REALLY busy, this place could be an acceptable Plan B. But Lindo's never THAT busy\" - in other words, we likely won't be back.",

I loved the fact the owner immediately recognized us and welcomed us with open arms. Their lunch specials are a great deal and comes with a drink! Score!! If you leave room for dessert, you have to try their churros! Better than Disneyland's!! Can't wait to go back and try their happy hour. 7 days a week 3-7 HH is prime time on my book!!",

Have found the steak fajitas to be tough and the shrimp tend to get overcooked.  Stick with the chicken and you will be happy.  Chicken chimichanga was large, but salty.  Ice tea tastes freshly brewed.  My very critical 86 year old mother gives  Juan's the thumbs up.  I don't know a better recommendation than that.",

Chips, dip and salsa were so good we couldn't stop eating while waiting for the lunch entree. They were on top of drink refills and chip refills like some kind of magic from Disney land. It's hard to make me feel like I am on vacation while on lunch break but hey I really felt that way. I got the Mulitas and it was very good. The service coupled with food quality were out standing for the price. I will be back for sure.",

But the 3rd visit puts Juan's back in 4 Star territory. And there are two key reasons for those stars. Our server, Omar provided great service, and then there's the steak. The OMG, melt in your mouth, cooked to perfection steak tacos that my wife ordered. It was so good she shared some with my son and I and it got a unanimous vote of approval. One bite and we gave each other \"that look\"... the smile that comes from when you order something and it exceeds your expectations and is just amazing!   Parking was a bit of a pain as always but the wait was super short, the front door staff actually paid attention to us this time and then when Omar took over we were well on our way to a good experience.   Try the queso, and don't ignore the plate of jalapenos and onions they bring out. Dip those jalapeno slices in the queso and you'll be hooked. I'm also a fan of their fish taco. It's one of the few that's not overly cooked or more batter than fish.   I'm happy to bump Juan's back to 4 Stars, and my wife is like we gotta try the steak fajitas next!",

The patio is nicely decorated with fresh flowers and most of the tables were in the shade at 6 PM.  Service was prompt and we started  with a pitcher of margarita's. A complementary appetizer of sliced jalapenos and sauteed onions was well received along with chips and 3 types of salsa. The Chicken Fajita for 1 was large enough for 2. The entree is served on a dutch oven type pot and is flamed table side. The chicken and vegetables were cooked perfectly and piping hot. A very tasty and satisfying dish that is served with tortillas, rice and a choice of black or re fried beans. The black beans were excellent.   Our server Hernan checked on us periodically and also refilled our margarita glasses. Juan's has a very comfortable atmosphere and treats it's guests like family. I look forward to a return experience as their menu has a large number of choices.",

When you come in you can go right which is a bigger dining area or go left which is their bar area which also has ample seating.   They got TV's by the bar area so you can watch your sports (golf was on...?) this area is pretty tight so impossible to get bad service in my opinion because staff is always walking by you, they really can't miss you.    You start out with noodle soup which I enjoyed, wasn't spicy. I ordered the steak ranchero, basically a steak with melted cheese on top. Comes with rice and refried beans. I enjoyed my meal but was thinking maybe I should have ordered the Fajita. Ellen F. ordered it and this guy rolls it out on a cart and whoosh! sets it aflame.   Wifey ordered it for one and aside from eating my steak I was able to pick at it as it was more than enough, they also have an option for two. We ordered margaritas and we're with my parents, they had booze to and some extra sides. All in all with Steak a Fajita for 1 and Fajita for 2, booze for four people it came out to about $81 with the 15% check-in coupon from Yelp.   Word of advice if your going to a place with the words flaming Fajita in its name, have the Fajita. As you want regret it, next time I'll try the shrimp Fajita.",

Each entree came with a yummy fideo soup (tomato soup with noodles), a choice of rice and beans or steamed veggies, and guacamole and sour cream. Everything was pretty good but I've definitely had better Mexican food. The chicken was a little bland in my opinion but then again my best friend is Mexican and her mom is an amazing cook!  Would we return? Eh probably not unless we were on that side of town.  Happy hour is worth checking out though. They have a good assortment of appetizers and drinks on it.",

Great service and loved the fajitas for 2 and happy hour margaritas- delish.  So glad to hear they are opening in Henderson end of September.  Will tell my friends and family",

After being told by a few clients of mine how amazing & authentic the food was at flaming fajitas, I of course was more then happy to drop by and try. In a city where it's not easy to find authentic Mexican food., I was very pleased with this place and how good the food and service was. Th bussers and servers were very attentive. They have a great happy hour menu, and margaritas are amazing. The only thing is that it's always busy and there's almost always a wait. But the wait is worth it. I will be back again.",

    "text": "A few months ago, Flaming Fajitas was only a month old, we stopped in for dinner while my sister and nephew were visiting. The five of us were eager to try the newest restaurant in the neighborhood. You'd think Las Vegas of all places would have great Mexican, and while it does have a couple gems, it really has a poor showing overall. However, Flaming Fajitas has brought some heat to the scene. I mean that quite literally.    I love spice. And Flaming Fajitas delivers. I love the plate of grilled onions and jalapenos that gets you started and the salsa is quite tasty. This is often the weak link when I dine out, but it fresh, bold and well balanced. The staff aims to please and they were more than willing to accomodate special requests made by our group. We were started with delicious fideo soup. Then, a short bit later, hot plates piled high with food swirled around us. I ordered the tacos al pastor. However, what was presented before me was not tacos al pastor. I don't know if the kitchen made an error or if they prepare them differently but these had no lingering flavor from chilies, nor a hint of pineapple. Whatever it was, it was decent, but fajitas is the name on the building and it's what you should get here.   My brother went with their signature Chicken Fajitas and there is quite the presentation; far more showy than any fajitas I've seen before. Usually you can hear them sizzling, but these are actually set on fire tableside.   The fajitas are excellent. So much so, I took my husband the following night we shared the steak and chicken fajitas for two. The chicken is far better than the steak. I noticed they also offer pork. I will try that next visit. I also prefer the corn to the flour tortillas. They have a great and reasonably priced beer selection to quench your thirst and come for happy hour to enjoy great specials.",

    "text": "Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!  Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!    We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!    We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!  The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!    This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!",

The chips with salsa and bean dip was spiced well. My mom ordered the chicken fajitas which were amazing and had flavor. I got the grilled fish tacos and chicken tamale with green sauce and it was very flavorful even the rices and beans were. The prices are a little cheaper compared to Lindo Michocan and way better quality. Even the margaritas are good. I got a mango margarita. I will be returning to this place more often. Oh and every entree you order you get a delicious fideo soup which is my favorite.   TIP: Ask for side of roasted jalapenos (free)",

Ambiance was nice plenty of booths arrived at approximately 5:15 PM seated within Five minutes, which was a surprise due to the line. the patio area was large and numerous people were enjoying their meals seated in the patio which had misters also they have huge welcoming bar area. I ordered the shrimp fajita and my other half ordered grilled fish tacos which were incredible with home made Corn and flour tortillas. i also ordered the fajita Nachos for happy hour $6.95 which was an incredibly generous portion. Shrimp Fajitas were great not to be forgotten is the Fire presentation for the Fajitas that arrived at our table. Omar was a warm and wonderful waiter who could not have given any better service. Jose the bus-boy was extremely attentive and ensured that all of our needs were met without having to request water or napkins.Jose needs to be promoted as a server as quick as possible.  Happy hour is from 5:00 PM until 7:00 PM so worth the visit you will not be disappointed also the prices were quite reasonable for the size of the portion. Who has happy hour on Saturday? very rare! Juan's offer a happy hour which you will enjoy.  I was so excited about Juan's and our experience i almost forgot to mention the bean dip and salsa with the best grilled onions and grilled chili peppers.       Omar and Juan thank you for a great experience and your exceptional service which is uncommon to have it all.  I love this place.....",

The service was great, food was equally as good, and prices were reasonable. My drink stayed refilled constantly. Chips with salsa and bean dip, both tasty, to start, then Fideo soup before the meal. They've only been open a couple of months, but there is no reason (other than maybe location) they can't give Bonita & Lindo a run for their money.  Will be going back often.",

The staff looks happy to be there, and genuinely care about their customers. It's fantastic.  The food is absolutely delicious.

    "text": "I frequent all varieties of  Mexican restaurants, from Roberto's to Mundo, but Juan's Flamin' Fajita is on the do not return list after my meal.  Many of the items that came to the table were not made in house. The chips were not fresh, some store bought variety. The salsa, despite many other reviews, was not fresh and pretty spicy. The margarita was the worst margarita I have ever purchased. The mix they use is super sweet and just plain terrible (and probably old). I tasted very little tequila and even less lime, odd for a drink that consists mainly of those two ingredients. It was so sweet  that my girlfriend couldn't even drink it (and this went completely unnoticed).   I ordered some of their \"Flamin' Fajitas,\" and was not impressed. It reminded me of something you could find at Chili's. The flame they give you at the table, while fun to watch, is terrible to taste. The protein was cooked beyond well done- chicken being super dry and steak being very tough.   I will say the service was pretty good.   The manager did notice our apparent dissatisfaction with the food, but at that point we knew we were not coming back and did not even bother explaining everything we found wrong with our visit.    Overall, it was not the worst meal I've ever eaten, but our experience was no where near five stars.   And on an unrelated note about Juan's, the font on their menu is horrendous. It is childish and ugly, I think they should change it. However I will not be returning to check.",

They make really good margaritas and have such reasonable prices. The chips and salsa are the BEST I've ever had! They give you 2 different salsas, refried beans and cheese, and grilled peppers and onion. Really great to munch on while you drink and wait for your food. The service is also outstanding. I love their chimichangas, fajitas, and enchiladas. Their shrimp ceviche is pretty bland and tasteless, it's definitely missing seasoning and that tangy lime juice taste. They could definitely improve on that. Overall one of my fave spots in Vegas. Five stars!",

Two kinds of salsa and a bean dip come with chips when you sit down, as well as grilled onions and jalapenos.

The main course combination platter of a Chile Rellano and chicken flauta was very good.  The star of the show were the steak fajitas.  Outstanding taste and the steak was perfectly marinated and cooked.  Flour tortillas were obviously made in house.  Will definitely order them again on our next visit.",

The free chips and salsa are all store bought crap. I swear the bean dip comes straight from the can. The quality and service are low!

They placed my friend and I at the table in front of the window where they make the tortillas. So I had a very clear view of the tortilla bin. When I saw that the servers stuck their hands in the tortillas to place them in the baskets I was in shock. I was surprised not to see some type of chip scooper or someone wearing gloves ....something !!!! And the people that were taking the chips out were also taking peoples money, credit cards, etc. I'm pretty sure if the health dept. came through that would be a violation. Let just say I was good on eating any more chips.",

Go before 12p or after 2p for lunch, go before 6p or after 8p for dinner.   Of course the name says it all, order the fajitas they are all good all the combos. We usually order the beef because the chicken when reheated tends to dry out. They're generous with refilling our salsa and bean dips.   The Chile verde and all the soups are winners for us. But there's so much choices for everyone. The only disappointment is that the shrimp cocktail is not as good as I hoped it would be. Not enough flavor or Clamato.",

They start you off with complimentary chips, 2 types of salsa, bean dip and grilled onions and jalapenos!! Service is excellent and every one is so friendly and efficient.  Excellent lunch specials (including $3.95 lunch margarita!!) served with rice and beans. I appreciate the fact that they mention their bean dip is not vegetarian but you can request their vegetarian version. Kids meals include soup, entree, drink and choice of fries or rice/beans.   Happy hour is in the entire restaurant and everyday from 3 pm to 7 pm. Lots of margarita choices, also have wine/beer, well drinks and food specials.   I did not get to try fajitas this time but they looked really great. Can't wait to return for happy hour and dinner.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. With all the great reviews, I don't know why it took us so long to get around to going here.   We sat in the bar area, which was less crowded than the main dining room. Our waiter, Alex, was right there waiting to take our orders. I try to stay away from mixed drinks these days, but the wine availability is very limited. So I decided to have a small (12 oz.) margarita. Because the kind of wines I wanted wasn't stocked, I was treated to HH pricing and my choice of tequila. It was the best margarita I've ever had, by a landslide. Not too syrupy, just the right amount of ice, and the slice of lime in the bottom of the glass kept it flavorful to the last sip. Next time I won't care about the wine; I'll just go straight for the hard stuff.  We ordered the flaming fajitas for two - chicken for my husband, Mr. Cluck, and shrimp for me. I was so happy to learn that we could have regular or black beans, rice or - be still, my heart - steamed veggies, and could choose two of those in any combination. I swear, in my next life I definitely WILL be a vegetarian! The veggies were a mix of many kinds, and fresh and unadorned, just as I like them. The black beans didn't taste like they came out of a can. The tortillas were the lightest I've ever tasted, which explained why the complimentary tortilla chips were light as air, too.  Those tortilla chips were accompanied by a dish of grilled onions and jalapeno strips, and two salsas and a bean dip. When I tried the bean dip I thought I tasted lard. I asked Alex, and he confirmed it, then asked if we wanted dip without lard. It was replaced before I could blink.  To top off the fabulous service and food, the background was my beloved Mariachi music, making me yearn for the good ol' days, when I was in school there for three summers and then visiting the country often twice a year. Juan's is that authentic, and I look forward to another visit very soon.",

    "text": "If you are looking for Mexican food that is close to authentic, this is the place to go. It is not fancy, so very casual is what the environment is all about. I liked the fact that there was a vegetarian menu section. I myself am vegetarian for the last few months so this was very nice to see. I ordered the vegetarian fajitas and they were delicious! They brought a nice portion of sour cream helping to the table with it. Apparently, the beans are not vegetarian but you can request vegetarian beans and they will bring it. The rice was just OK but the beans are delicious. The meal starts with a small portion of Fideo soup that was yummy. They also bring fresh tortillas to the table and three different sauces come with it: a mildly spicy salsa and a spicier salsa and bean dip, as well as a plate of fried onions and jalapenos. My friend ordered a different vegetarian enchilada with she greatly enjoyed as well and we ordered a chicken enchilada for her son and he loved it.  The margarita was the house margarita and it was only four dollars and for four dollars it was pretty yummy. The service is very friendly. So why only four stars? I would have given this place 4 1/2 stars if I could, but the reason I did not give it five stars is because we found it to be way too informal. There are other Mexican restaurants in town that work on giving it more of a flair with a nicer environment. It was too plain and we did not find the seats comfortable. It was the closest one to our house which is why it was ideal, but there are other Mexican restaurants in town that have food that I believe is just as good, if not better, with vegetarian options, and are just more comfortable and much nicer to look inside. That is my only critique of this place.",

You know the food is good when the restaurant is super busy on only a Tuesday night, jam packed with at least 30 people waiting for a table. While I've eaten at Juan's for lunch before, this was my first time at the restaurant at dinner time and getting takeout.   Elizabeth provided great, friendly service at the hostess stand and happily accommodated the special requests in my order. And amazingly, my take out order came out accurately with the special requests, it came out with everything as I ordered and paid for and it came out in 10 minutes - 10 minutes faster than the originally quoted 20 minutes and while they were extremely busy!  And on top of awesome service, the food was delicious (especially love the salsa) and so much food with ordering just two entrees! With people still waiting for a table while I left with food already, you might as well just order take out, save lots of time and eat in the comfort of your own home!",

The fajitas are lit on fire table side before serving them, so ladies and long hair guys.... watch your hair :P They do serve chips & salsa with meals, but their queso and/or guacamole are worth upgrading to.   For some reason, I've only ever sat in the bar area, which is loud and nothing fancy. But it does mean that ordering drinks is easier and drinks arrive faster! They have an outdoor area which would be nice if Ft Apache wasn't a busy-ish road. There's also a bigger, non-bar seating area that has some traditional-ish decor. It's a pretty sizable restaurant.   Overall, it's a fun place and the food is really good. I highly recommend it",

Our server was also extremely friendly and prompt.   The host desk was slightly disorganized. We were sat after 15 min, at the empty table we watched from the front area. It seemed as though this was happening a lot from the grumbling of the other patrons around us. I just don't think they knew what tables were open in the restaurant.",

If you go during happy hour, you'll get some nice options of food and drinks at a great price point. Truly a great experience, friendly staff, decent portions and upbeat ambience. This establishment also offers some nice Decour and is family friendly. I would definitely go back again when I visit Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Consistency is key! My fiance and I have been to Juan's four times now, and the food has been nothing short of amazing every time.  Service has been spotty, unfortunately, as once when we sat at the bar, the bartender was rather unattentive (outside of peak hours, mind you), and another time when we sat at a table in the bar area, we had what amounted to an absentee server. During our other two visits, we received impeccable service. I can't even deduct a star for the spotty service, however, as the food is so good that it compensates for service issues.  They have a pretty good happy hour. Get there early for it though, or you may not get a seat.  Speaking of getting there early, if you visit during peak dinner hours, particularly on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be face with around a half hour wait for seating. It's totally worth it. However, your best bet for avoiding a wait is to get there before 6pm or after 7:30.  In Joey Tribbiani voice: Entrees? Good Queso? Good Gauc? GOOD!  I haven't tried the fajitas yet, but their tacos, taquitos (which are very cheap during happy hour by the way), nachos (also a good HH special), and burritos are all delicious. The grilled chicken is easily their most flavorful protein  The crispy rancho style taco is my favorite thing on the menu so far. Ordinarily, I don't care for crunchy tacos, as it hurts my teeth and gums to eat them. This taco is actually not crunchy though, and \"crispy\" is the perfect descriptor. Order the combination plate and get a couple of them!",

So worse, we didn't come back for two years and we actually flipped a coin, it won.   Well to our surprise, the same waiter that we had two years ago that was so rude and a horrible human being, was the same waiter.  But this time, he was a changed man.  I don't know if he was complained on before and management talked to him, or their was a mandatory class on how not to be a horrible human as your waitering? Let me tell you, he was great.  The food was great and my family had a change of heart. Two weeks later(about 6 days ago), we returned to the restaurant and continued to have a great time with the staff and food.   So, after a bad experience we gave this place a second and third chance and came out, loving this place.",

Thankfully they have a bar you can grab a drink at to wait.  I did the fajitas with steak and shrimp. They come out literally on fire and smoking on a giant cast iron plate. You also get a side of rice, beans, pico, sour cream, and gauc along with your tortillas. The veggies had a little of that char flavor, and the meat was tender.   They also bring out chips with 2 kinds of salsa and some bean dip that was all amazing. I definitely can't wait to go back and try some of the other food!",

I'm sorry but it really was ... food was a 7-10 pretty decent, nothing to write home about though. Lindo is better..  Update   The owner contacted me and reached out. Lunch was very good and the service was much better. Thank you Juan I will be back again.",

We got there at 5pm and our wait was 30 min., but we knew there would be a wait a head of time. We were told by staff that there is usually at least a half hour wait all day long. The complimentary chips and salsa were awesome and came with two different salsa options and a warm bean dip. We had the shrimp fajitas and chicken fajitas. Both were excellent. Service was excellent even though they were extremely busy. Every employee from the hostess to the manager were polite, friendly, and efficient. Multiple staff members kept checking on us to see if we needed anything. Additionally we witnessed the Manager, Amanda, deal with a verbally aggressive husband and wife very professionally.  From what we gathered the husband and wife were upset about the wait they had and the wife cursed at the hostess. Once they were seated, Amanda listened to their concerns and tried to diffuse the situation. No matter how rude the husband and wife became Amanda was very polite and professional in dealing with them.",

Not only did they say we lied about not having a to go box but she said I can't accommodate you. We go there all the time and when we said we wouldn't be coming back they just said okay !

The Salsa was very good, some of drinks seemed amazing others had as I just had Iced Tea, but I had a very good experience at a nice place not too expensive....

Chips with two kinds of salsa and bean dip, two cups of soup, six tortillas, two plates of beans and rice, two trays with pico de gallo and sour cream and guacamole, and a huge serving of sizzling steak, shrimp, peppers, and onions. Which they lit on fire when they brought it too our table, which was awesome. It was delicious, and for the sheer amount of food, the price can't be beat. (The leftovers made a huge lunch for us the next day.) We also ordered horchata, which comes with free refills. It was on the sweet side, but I enjoyed it. Very impressed, and we'll go back again the next time we pass through Vegas.",

Food was mediocre I thought as well as my dining partner. Ordered a chimichanga & it wasn't crispy or hot. Rice & refired beans were not warm either. Sadly disappointed. Maybe I should have ordered the fajitas as they light them on fire tableside (would have been warm @ least). The old SuperMex on Green Valley Parkway & Pecos had the best chimis. 3 for the great service when they were packed.",

This is a fantastic lunch spot and I've been here about 20 times in the last two years. It's a pretty large place between the restaurant and cantina side so if there's wait it usually isn't too long. I work from home and have often just came here for lunch where I almost always get the shrimp fajitas for $11 and leave stuffed. This can be attributed to the fact that I eat way too many tortilla chips because the warm bean dip they bring when you sit down is addictive. Service is usually pretty good here and I've never had a complaint about the food either. Perhaps the only thing I dislike about coming here is that it's in a busy shopping center next to In-N-Out so parking can suck sometimes, but it's not really a big deal.",

I am fussy about Mexican food and I was very satisified here and will return. The managment staff is present during the evening and I received a very pleasant follow up note from the Owner. This is definately a restaurant that  cares about their customers. This makes for an all around good experience.

    "text": "I was in the mood for some delicious Mexican food and came to trusty Yelp to find it. Juan's isn't close to me, but I was willing to travel to meet a friend for dinner so this is what we decided on. We got to the restaurant at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and it was packed! They told us the wait would be around 40 minutes. Both of us were okay with the wait, so we stood outside chatting, waiting for them to call our name. The wait ended up being only 20 minutes or so and inside we went. We were brought chips and salsa fairly quickly and within 5 minutes of sitting down, we ordered our drinks. I ordered a Mai Tai and it was amazing. It was strong and tasty and not expensive. Then a few minutes later, the waiter returned to take our orders. I ordered their flaming chicken fajitas and my friend did enchiladas. About 15 minutes later we received our food and a show of sorts when they light the fajitas on fire in front of you. I also asked for a side of cheese which is an extra $1.50 but holy mountain of cheese Batman! They do not skimp you on anything. Now, the food. No lie- THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS I'VE EVER HAD! Ever! The flavor was on point. There was no one seasoning that overpowered another. The portion sizes were good as well and the food that I took home for leftovers was devoured the next day and let me tell you, it tasted just as good reheated as it did the night before. As we finished up, we noticed it was close to closing time, but no one rushed us. We were able to enjoy our food and take our time. When we got our bills, I was so impressed by the total! It was less than $40 for both of us. For good drinks and great food? That's unheard of! I will be singing Juan's praises to everyone, because it was that good and I look forward to returning as soon as I can!",

It's a tableside show of high flames that kids will love. The beef and chicken fajitas for two is the way to go. Portion sizes were large enough that two of us had some left to take home.   Their guacamole is plenty good as are their margaritas, which they have several to choose from. Try a two item combo if you can't decide what to get. I opted for a chicken tamale that had a masa texture that was somewhat thick and gummy, but the flavor was solid. The al pastor burrito was filled with chunks of smokey, deep flavored pork. To finish the meal we tried their churros -- unfortunately too oily.  This place doesn't try to redefine the cuisine, they just do a solid job of executing typical Mexican-American fare at decent prices in a great atmosphere.",

    "text": "This is another 3.5 star situation for me. But because of a few things, it just feels more like a 3 than a 4.   My girlfriend and I went here for their happy hour (3-7 daily), and since I love margaritas and very infrequently get them, I was excited about their margarita on happy hour. We got there and we ordered a margarita, a daiquiri, the quesadilla, and the nachos.   On the happy hour menu, they have a bunch of apps which looked good, but we were sticking to cheap and the nachos and quesadillas were listed as 3.99.   My margarita was... Bad. It was a house margarita, and weirdly enough I had the exact same experience at a NYC restaurant with their happy hour margarita. It tasted like toilet cleaner. I guess when they pre mix a huge batch for happy hour, it's easy to mess it up. I told the bartender and he switched it out immediately, I don't know if it was because it was good service or because this happens a lot. I barely finished my sentence and he was making me a new fresh one.   The quesadillas were very very good, and we had agreed to get chicken on it instead of just cheese. I figured ok. At 3.99 we could take the upcharge for chicken right? Well unfortunately he failed to mention that by adding chicken it was no longer the happy hour menu item, so it was $7 dollars. Not a big deal, but was expecting a little bit less.   The nachos were... Very bland. They had way to much bean on it and it honestly canceled out the cheese taste. It was covered with cheese but you barely tasted it, and nachos without cheesiness are a waste IMO.   Overall, I liked my second margarita a lot, the daiquiri was pretty good, and the quesadilla was delicious. The manager also checked with us as did the bartender multiple times to make sure things were OK, so clearly they care about service. However, with that bad first margarita and very mediocre nachos, I just can't give this place a four at the moment. Will go back to try again!",

Time after time, Juan's delivers (pun intended) high quality, fresh, delicious food. Their carne asada (ordered in salad and burrito) is so good!   I love the healthy options - their steamed veggies aren't lame carrots either, it's a mix of zucchini, cauliflower, and broccoli -- AND they are small pieces not giant chunks.   And once again - that green salsa is bomb.  I love this place!!!",

    "text": "The wait was longer than I would have expected on a Monday night (20 minutes) but luckily there was room in the bar.   We got there a little before 7pm and were able to order off the happy hour menu. We got the queso, which was good but more cheese than 2 people should eat in one sitting.  For my entree, I got the 2-item combo (I love a combo!) with chile rellano and chicken enchilada. I enjoyed both, especially because the chile rellano wasn't heavily coated with batter. Came with soup, which I liked so much I also had the hubby's portion. For dessert, we ordered the fried ice cream which I liked. Ice cream is a combination of 3 flavors (I think caramel, vanilla and chocolate?) and was still very cold inside the deep fried batter, but the batter was chewier than I expected.  My overall experience was good. The only thing that dampened it was there was a large projection screen in the bar, which was showing the hockey game and the table next to us was overly loud and obnoxious with their hockey commentary. But that's not Juan's fault, lol.",

    "text": "Had to check this place out with such a high rating!  After a fun filled day of adventures we were starving driving back into Vegas so I went into my bookmarks and decided we were going to finally come here. I have to say this place is doing it! Lots of people waiting to be seated when we came in and when we came out. That's always a good sign!  It's crazy loud. Lots of celebrations going on everywhere and tons of tv's all around playing multiple games. I wasn't into all the tv's and it made it feel somewhat of a sports bar and the decor wasn't my favorite either as it was a tad on the commercial side. It reminded me of visiting the super touristy spots in Mexico that I didn't enjoy too much. But everything else was great.  The service is very friendly. The food was delicious & filling, especially if you're extra hungry and the best part was the older gentleman walking around singing Spanish songs with his guitar. What a nice touch! Also ~ all Yelp check-ins receive 15% off! Thanks Yelp!   We of course had to try the fajitas and they are cooked in front of you sparking a fire that warms the entire room and I had a cheese enchilada with a hard chicken taco that were very flavorful. Everything was great and it's definitely a very fun and energetic place. Expect a possible wait time as this place is very popular.",

We arrived around noon and the place wasn't busy at all. We were seated in the bar area and given the full menu as well as their lunch specials after our drink orders were taken. The lunch specials were all very reasonably priced and they all include a soft drink or iced tea. I decided on the steak fajitas with corn tortillas and my mom chose the chicken mulitas. Both came out quickly and of course the fajitas were flaming as promised. The first attempt didn't work out, so the server had to go back get some more oil to stoke the fire, literally. Second times a charm and they were certainly flaming. The fajitas were good. I don't typically order fajitas, but these were solid. I wish they were a little less well done, but all the flavors were right and the portion was generous. I enjoyed the entire meal.  The best part about Juan's is the fabulous service. Our server was so friendly and attentive and the rest of the staff checked in with us regularly, made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed to make our meal the best it could be.",

The food was amazing we ordered the street tacos with carne asada, the carne asada dish and the shrimp ceviche all was excellent flavor.  The margarita was delicious. We had leadership come by our table multiple times making sure we where well taken care of.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

The parking lot was packed and there was a 45 minute wait but we decided to wait it out and I normally roll my eyes to people who say, \"it's worth the wait\" at restaurants, but shiyet... it's worth the wait!! (Cue eye rolling)  The service was friendly and quick! They have mastered getting you in and out since they probably always have a wait. Their guava margarita was strong and good, their shrimp ceviche was delicious, and their steak sizzling fajitas were tender and amazing! We only ordered an order of one for the fajitas and it was actually perfect for two! We also decided to order the fried ice cream and that too certainly did not disappoint. We practically ate the whole thing. I see now why this place is bringing in the crowds....  You want Mexican food? This place is where you need to be.",

    "text": "Why did I give it 4 stars? Well their speciality the fajita which has a great flaming presentation but lacks flavoring. I mean it's bland without the usual meat marinade so one must use the salsa to give it a boost. I'd suggest ordering something else in all honesty.  On the bright side their appetizers are freaking fantastic. The sampler plate is a must and I'll probably order that for dinner if I ever go back.   If there is anything I'd like to 5 star. It's the service. Our server was super attentive and on the ball. Our beverages never ran out and her timing was perfect.",

The chips come with 3 types of salsa. All good. I ordered the combo with burrito, fish taco and tamale. Great portion size I left with lunch for the next day. They do have a happy hour where you can get good deals on drinks.  Now my issue. While eating my food I noticed something sticking me in my throat. I figured it was just chips that didn't go all the way down. After drinking copius amounts of water it was still there. It was uncomfortable and irritating but I just figured it was part of a chip and or would go away.  I finally went home, 17 miles away and just decided to look into a mirror. I noticed like a splinter at the back of my mouth. I had to use scissors to pull it out. I added a photo.   Juan's has a great reputation and by no means is this an everyday occurrence. Food is great, better than great. Service is always good but I can't ignore this this one issue.",

    "text": "Wow Juan's!!!!  You guys delivered on food, customer service and deliciousness. This is my second time visiting Juan's and both times I have been impressed.  On my first visit I ordered a yummy chicken chimichanga with rice and beans and a 16 oz draft beer. The portions are so big that I had plenty of food left over for lunch the next day.   On our second visit my fiance and I ordered the smothers steak, and shrimp fajitas for two and oh my oh my. Each person get their own plate of sour cream, guacamole, rice and beans and a choice of flour or corn tortillas. If you sit close to the kitchen you can see someone making fresh tortillas while you wait for your food. I also order a strawberry house margarita and it was delicious. They have all different sizes but I opted for the 12oz and it was perfect. Amanda out waitress informed me that the house margarita is popular because it is in the happy hour menu so it is ordered more, but her favorite was the top shelf margarita. (I'm trying her suggestion on my next visit)  I love how as soon as you sit down someone is there to take your Drink order and give you complementary chips, veggies, bean dip and salsa. I am unsure if soup comes with every meal but the two times that I have visited, I have gotten yummy soup.  The menu has a ton of food options and a great happy hour menu as well as lunch menu.  If you're ever in the mood for some delicious food I suggest giving Juan's a try. You want be disappointed",

Upon entry of the business, I went to the front counter to hopefully get seated for myself and two more members of my party. To my amusement, although I'm in front of the hostess's- they don't seem to know where the line starts or ended. So after two other parties that came in before me were checked in, I decided to leave. Overall, I would have to say customer service here is a fail. I'm willing to come back and give this place another try later and update my review but as it stands... not for a while.",

Luckily my friend had arrived earlier and had already secured seating.  The service and food was great.  The carne fajitas were tender enough I could cut them with my fork.  The flour tortillas were very moist; sticking together in the tin foil(not a bad thing).   The salsas provided with the chips were delicious.   One of them looked like a roasted version and it was my favorite of the salsas presented.  The only item I would say that I ordered that I did not finish was the refried beans.  To me they were good, but on par with my other favorite Mexican restaurant beans.  You can feel the heat coming off the fajitas when they flambe them table side.  There were a couple of times when they would be serving other customers nearby and I was concerned that one of people in my party would have her hair ignited as she used a lot of hairspray and the flaming fajitas were very near her!  Luckily, she stayed flambe-free.  I wish the tables were not packed in so close together.  You have to maneuver carefully so as not to bump into people seated as you attempt to get to and from seating.  I realize they are popular so they pack in as much seating as they can, but it makes for feeling like you are also dining with others nearby.  I was too full to try a dessert; a good reason to come back.  There is covered patio dining.  The parking lot is challenging as the spaces are packed in like the seating inside the restaurant.  These 'challenges' however will not deter me from coming back.  I've been here once and anticipate returning.",

It seems dangerous and the pots are still extremely hot when placed on your table so please be careful.  You can order various choices like beef, chicken, or shrimp or get the combo for 2 and save a few bucks.  Served with chip and 2 kinds of salsa/beans.  Then you get a soup with noodles in it (see photo).  Fajitas are served with sour cream, salsa, and guacamole as well as corn/flour tortillas.  I thought the flavoring of the steak and shrimp was pretty good. The real go get 'er is the frozen margaritas.  Quite a few awesome choices like mango or guava and I loved the guava!  It is a really strong margarita too so keep in mind you light weights   Service/Ambiance: good service, cleaned away dishes well.  We were a huge party and our name wasn't on the list even though we made a reservation so they still made room for us even though we made a reservation.  Glad they could make room for a large party since they had made the mistake, very nice business!  Ambiance is whimsical, otherwise very packed since so many people want fajitas on fire!    Get them while they are HOT-HOT-HOT",

The bean dip and salsa verde was delicious but the white cheese dip is exactly what we were looking for. I could finish off a cup on my own. Honesty everything was excellent.  Special thanks to the wait staff Yajaira and Paty, we never ran out of soda and they made us feel right at home. Entire restaurant is super clean and comfortable. I'm already looking forward to our next family dinner at Juan's.",

    "text": "If you're not looking to read a long review but want to know whether this place is worth a visit then YES IT IS!! If you fancy great Mexican food, go right now!!  Ok, so a break down...  My partner and I tried this place for dinner and despite it being quite bustling, we were greeted and seated right away.  The restaurant itself is fun aesthetically, casual and from the art on the walls, it's got more of a coastal Mexican vibe with beach scenes and little bar tops that stick out and covered with straw.  Lupe was our server and got us some complimentary water and chips and dip straight away. The chips and dip were a great size to share while browsing the menus and the onions, chillis, sauces and beans to accompany were really flavourful and tasty, rather than bland and gloopy like I sometimes experience in restaurants.  My partner went for a straightforward soda. I on the other hand asked for a mocktail-style drink - orange, cran and pineapple with a splash of sprite. Lupe was only too happy to oblige and it tasted good!  We ordered some taquitos to share as a starter and it was a lot larger of a portion that we envisaged. Arrived hot, full of tasty, juicy meat, wrapped in crispy tortilla and with a delicious guac/lettuce mix, sour cream and salsa. So good!!! Would have again in a heartbeat!  For mains, I went for the JFFC taco salad. This one comes with steak for less than $1 more than the ground beef version and it was delicious! FULL of flavour, ingredients and the bowl itself held really well without going soggy. I loved it!!  My partner did a combo plate with tacos Al Pastor & a tostada. He loved them all and as part Mexican, he's had his fair share of Mexican food.  As I asked him to remind me what he ate so I could write this review, he told me he's hungry again and wants to go back tomorrow. That's how good the food was!  Staff were super attentive throughout our experience and offered napkins and takeaway boxes before I even had chance to ask because, of course, we ordered too much!  Both my partner and I loved every dish and every part of our time at Juan's. We'd come back in a heartbeat.. possibly tomorrow..!  Give it a go. You won't regret it!!!",

    "text": "Wow.  Just wow.  Fajitas on fire, y'all! Dropped in here over the weekend to check out this place because of the Yelp reviews, and was NOT disappointed. The food was scrumptious, and the service was more than fine.  It's a bit dark and cavernous, and a little noisy and chaotic, but it's a definite return!  The servers are above average in hospitality.  They greet you warmly upon entering, and if there is no line (if you're lucky like we were), you will be taken directly to your table.  The decor is kitsch and pub crawl.  The menu is the typical oversized, overabundant offerings.    But the food...the food is Tony the Tiger, GRRR-EAT.  With an emphasis on \"eat.\" They actually bring you something like an amuse bouche, a tasty, piquant tomato soup that just opens your appetite. You are also gifted with perfectly cooked onions and roasted jalapenos that are not so spicy that you cannot enjoy them by themselves.  The chips and salsa (my favorite) are like a meal in themselves, they are so flavorful and hearty.  We picked the shrimp and steak fajitas for two, and were delighted when they arrived IN FLAMES! What a show! If you have small kids, (well, heck, even us!), they will squeal.  The show was not just eye candy.  The food was really good.  The steak was well-cooked, as were the vegetables.  The shrimp made you feel you were in an oceanside town.  How could they possibly taste that plump and fresh? The fajitas come with a side of tortillas that taste made in house (whether they are or not, I don't know), and rice and beans that will make your Mexican grandmother proud.  Forget keto.  I ate them all!  The price for the two of us eating to our heart's delight came to $36.00 before tip.  Can you say, \"bargain?\" Yes, you can.  Will we be back? Why, yes, I hope we will.",

Watching the flaming fajitas being served as the flames shoot up about 3 feet and smelling them is fun. It's even better when you're the one eating them.  I'm writing this at 12:30 in the morning.

The hostesses were very welcoming & we got seated promptly. I noticed we got sat next to a bigger party which our sever was also taking nonetheless he was still very attentive and didn't forget about us. His busser (wish I could remember their names) took our drink order which showed great team work.   They have really nice chips & salsa/beans, accompanied by Chile's toreados & cebollitas which they bring out right after you're sat. I ordered the ceviche as an appetizer which was great. For the entree I had their Camarones a la Diabla & as soon as the server said they add Chile the arbol & other extra spicy spices I was all for it. FINALLY a la diabla style that was actually spicy & still enjoyable (for me). My mom & her boyfriend had the fajita dinner (it was their second time there and they loved it before just as this time)  Before we new it we were the last table left after they closed (which we apologize for as we know how annoying that is) yet, besides the fact, our server still talked to us and didn't seem to be rushing us out in any way. Definitely knew how to make us have an enjoyable experience.   It's just about 5 min away from my house so will definitely be back!",

    "text": "My wife and I are new to Vegas, and after an underwhelming return from our google search for good Mexican food, we decided to try Juan's out.  The restaurant is nice enough: good appearance, well decorated and thought out, everything appeared clean inside and out.  Be prepared for a tight parking situation if you arrive during the lunch hour.  When we went, Juan's was not busy, but its already narrow parking lot is situated right next to a popular In N Out location which can make things a bit tricky around that time. Not a real problem, however.  I enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa.  The chips weren't served warm but they were fresh and tasted quite good.  The salsa was enjoyable too.  It was a pretty standard house salsa but I didn't mind it at all.  Most Mexican restaurants offer free chips and salsa when you dine in, but what I really appreciate about Juan's is there unique addition to this tradition.  They also bring out a bowl of refried beans (very tasty), and a plate of roasted Jalapenos and sauteed onions to the table.  Honestly, I love snacking before a meal, and im a spicy food fanatic, so these complimentary offerings really speak to me.  I can't say I enjoyed the rest of my experience as much. My wife ordered a steak fajita burrito and I got a two-item lunch combo with a chile relleno and an enchilada.  The presentation was decent, but there were no stand-out flavors.  Enchiladas are one of my favorite things in the world to eat and I've got to say that Juan's take on them are just sort of average. I liked the relleno a little better, but it wasn't great.  The meat in my wife's burrito was pretty good but she didn't like her meal, overall.  I'll admit, it's a little unfair to visit a place with \"Fajitas\" in the title and not order a fajita platter to try on our first trip, so maybe we'll try that if we ever return.  Juan's serves pretty decent Mexican food, the place is clean and the staff is friendly.  I didn't hate anything, but nothing really left me wanting more.",

Our server was really attentive and nice and so was the wait staff assisting him.   Some tips: Unless you're dangerously hungry, an entree should be enough for one person. We got an appetizer, entree and drink, and boy, were we filled. We ended up taking a lot of to-go.  The food itself is awesome though. What we had:  House Margaritas ($3.50 during happy hour from 3pm-7pm. Felt like a generous portion of tequila. I like.) Juan's Sampler (Tasted great, but wow did it fill us up.) Combo Beef & Shrimp Fajita for Two. (Great flavor and very tender. Comes with a good portion of sounds. They even light it on fire before they serve it, awesome.)  There are also the complimentary chips and dip. Honestly, one of the best dining experiences I've had. Great place. Our server even mentioned they were planning on increasing the store hours for later nights since they have a full bar and all.",

First pyromaniacs will love this place! The name \"Flaming Fajitas\"  is well deserved and quite frankly and understatement. When they bring your Fajitas out the server ignites the dish and the flames shoot 3 to 4 feet into the air!   The food was top notch fresh and flavorful. The only negative experience of the entire night was in relationship to their cheese dish I ordered to go along with my chips. It had to be cut with a knife and fork and couldn't be spooned up by a nacho chip. It had great flavor but I won't order it again as it was to much effort for chips and dip.  The wait staff was great, drinks were never more than half empty, the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip was similarly filled whenever they appeared low. We had one main waiter but he was getting help from everyone else on the staff and he was helping out the other waiters and their tables. It would appear they are a highly functional unit that wasn't worried about sharing their tables tips. Simply stated it was a True pleasure to dine here.  You could read that and guess it was a slow night but no, there was only one maybe two empty tables in the entire restaurant.   If you live near or far you must come experience this dining experience its something you will not regret!",

See how I pick my friends?  Always thinking about the sugar!  Anyway, we had a solid meal here, going with the flaming fajitas, of course.  I got chicken and my pals shared a chicken and steak combo for two.  Both courses came out in a timely manner, with the flaming presentation for each, literally.  It's cool to see your food on fire.  I enjoyed my chicken fajitas and my pals rated the chicken better than the steak, too.  The chips and salsa were nothing special.  Service is attentive and friendly and the rest of the menu is quite extensive, but for my first visit I had to have the fajitas and not bad at all for $13.95.  I'll come back to try something different next time--nice to have an option for Mexican cuisine on this side of town, near Sweet Addiction AND Perfect Scoop ;).",

Omar always starts us with a heaping plate of chili's toreados and queso fundido.  We love the fried chili's and onions rolled in tortillas.   Our meal started with a cup of fideo soup always yummy and full of flavor.  While the draw here is the flaming fajitas our favorite has always been the seafood parillada for 2.  It is shrimp, fish and scallops on a bed of grilled onions.  While it was for 2, the 3 of us did not finish it and there was still some fish on the plate.  Omar finished our meal with a complimentary fried ice cream.  Service and food have always been top notch here and all your requests are easily met.  We have been coming here at least once a month since they opened and if we did not have a 45 minute drive across town to get there it would definitely be more often.

The chips and salsa were fine, in fact, the salsa was actually pretty flavorful. The fajitas were very enjoyable, but the accompaniments left a lot to be desired. The refried beans creeped me out a little, and my wife reported her guacamole to be quite watery at the bottom. They just didn't seem very fresh.  I had a pretty strong-ass Patron margarita, too. Although - and this sounds totally lame - the balance was a bit off. The tequila overpowered the rest of the drink. I know - that's the dumbest thing ever to complain about.

It was made (AFTER our dinner was served) & was very bland. No offer was made for enhancements. Our chip bowl was crumbs & was never replaced. No one came to check on us. We quickly were out of napkins & were using the beverage napkins. While we were still eating we were offered to-go boxes & plates were removed- WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING!!

Nothing too complicated, most dishes $10-12.  Interior of restaurant is nice and service is polite but painfully slow. Complimentary chips, salsa, and beans stave off hunger, but after half an hour (and being one of few tables, early on a weekday), no one had been served. We let the staff know we would need to get our orders to go, and it still took an additional 15 minutes until we were brought our food and checks. No one ordered anything more complicated than tacos, burritos, and a chicken breast. We were never given an explanation for the delay.   CHILE RELLENO: overly battered but tasty, not spicy, quite cheesy. GREEN CHILE PORK BURRITO: wrapped in a flour tortilla, dry, more like an enchilada than a burrito. Didn't care for this. Side of GRILLED VEGGIES was an odd assortment of broccoli, cauliflower, and squash- considering this is a Mexican restaurant I kind of expected onions and peppers, maybe mushrooms and squash, so it was an odd but tasty.  Restaurant entrance has several posters with their daily specials, and they also offer a HH and MNF specials. Seems like the fajitas are the best thing to get here, given the name and the fiery presentation.",

Couple of things threw me off though. 1 the size of the plates in comparison with the size of the table. I was so uncomfortable trying to find a place for everything (and squished next to my husband) and that's with two couples ordering only 2 meals to share! The second thing- I ordered veggies as my side with the fajitas expecting veggies I could add into the fajitas? Corn? Additional peppers? Something? But it was steamed cauliflower broccoli and carrots that reminded me of Marie Calendars. Just unfitting for the restaurant lol",

I ordered the shrimp fajita lunch, my friend ordered the steak fajita. My shrimp was big and juicy which was awesome. I  got rice and vegetables with my fajitas. Loved the vegetables that came with it. We both ordered cocktails. My strawberry margarita on the rocks was perfect and yummy. It came in cool cute glasses. They give you chips with three different dips while you wait to order and get your food. Our food came out and everything was delicious. The price here was affordable and not overpriced.

Now whenever we come here we share the most delicious steak fajitas we have ever had.  What I really love is that you can get grilled veggies instead of rice and beans.  Their pico de gallo and guacamole that comes with the fajitas is fresh and delish too.  I love the grilled jalapenos and onions that come with the delicious salsas and a basket of chips when you come in.  What gives this four instead of five stars is the chips and tortillas - they are not made in-house.  The chips can be on the stale side.  I'm also not a fan of the soup that comes with the meals but no biggie - more room for fajitas!  However the warm, friendly and attentive service more than makes up for store bought chips.  Most of the time Juan himself comes and checks on you and service has always been terrific!  We love this place!",

I've been here I think 3-4 times so far, and I've tried the Fajitas and enchiladas, both were as good as any place I have ever eaten.  One of the things that I really like about this place is the chips n salsa they serve as appetizers.  The chips come with usually 3 or more types of salsa which are all very good, as well as comes with bean dip which is also very very good.  The atmosphere here is really nice.  They will often (usually at dinner hours) have a man playing Mexican guitar music while walking around the dinning area which is nice.  I have also been extremely amazed at how quickly the food arrives.  Normally with any Mexican restaurants, my family is able to go through 3-4 baskets of chips before our main course arrives, but here we are getting our food right around the time we finished the first basket.  Now this may depend on how busy they are, but so far I have never experienced a long wait for the food.  I will say the one downfall I experienced (which really isn't a negative on their part), is that we had to wait a long time to get seated due to them being so busy on one occasion.  This was around the dinner rush time on a weekend, so the line was all the way outside, but still it was worth the wait and I can understand why so many wanted to eat there.",

Because I love it & eat it all the time!!  1st visit: I had the chorizo tacos ... Excellent! Rice and beans were good, too I was especially impressed with the fideo soup ... very tasty broth.  I don't usually like fideo [Lindo you better step up your game]  Service was excellent ... I came after work, and got no grief for asking for a booth even though I was solo.   I'll probably give 5 stars after trying a few more items!!  2nd visit: less than 1 week later, I'm here after a hard day's work. Happy Hour ... YAY!  Enjoyed the HH classic margarita on the rocks. Today, I tried the Juan's sampler which included taquitos, nachos & quesadilla with sour cream, and guac ... Again enough food for two meals.   Excellent service, upon arrival I was asked if I wanted my usual booth ... Of course I did, glad the host remembered me.    I wish they were close to home, but they're close to work so that's OK too",

My favorite lunch plate is Mulitas and my favorite Jalisco dinner plate is the Pollo Asado with Rajas con Crema. Try it! You won't be disappointed!",

Service was exceptional (6 stars!). The staff was so friendly, through out the entire meal. We lost track of time talking and didn't realize that all the patrons had left and that it was waaay past closing (45 minutes +) and no one rushed us out. Even after we left and were getting in our car, someone came out just to say thanks and to have a good evening. On top of the outstanding service, the food was excellent and well priced. The complimentary chips and salsa came with beans and grilled onions and peppers. We ordered the guacamole and fajita steak nachos. Margaritas were only $4.50. Everything we ordered was delish! I highly recomment this place for a casual spot for good food and sipping on margaritas.",

Unfortunately, in every Mexican restaurant in which I've eaten, the fajitas cost twice as much as the combo plates, so I've been eating combos because I get 3 selections, and they fill me up. What separates this place from the other Mexican restaurants are the fajitas. They are reasonably priced, AND the portions are bigger than most other places, so for me, it's the best of both worlds. I can't fault them for being on the other side of town, so I'll just eat my combos closer to home, and when I'm in the mood for fajitas, I'll drive the extra 15 or 20 minutes and go here. It's worth it! Really, really good!",

We went to the bar and the bartender (I did not ask his name) was the coolest guy. We could see he took a great pride at what he did and really enjoyed his workplace. The owner (or manager, I was not sure) was constantly checking on us making sure everything was to our liking and there were no complains from our side. We used to go to Mi Lindo Michoacan a lot for its Queso Fundido, now this place can easily compete with them. Got a pitcher of margarita made with Corralejo Anejo only for $28 and that's some good stuff!!! Bartender recommended Steak and Shrimp Fajitas and that's what we got for an entree. When the food runner brought it to us he actually flamed the cast iron skillet. Great presentation! Now the flavor was....WOW!!! Shrimp were so fatty and juicy and steak had nice charr, just the way we like it.  They told us it's going to be a great fiesta for May, 5th with mariachis and drinks specials, so we will do our best to make it there ( we are in the middle of moving). Thank you gentlemen for taking such a great care of us! We will be back soon and I would highly recommend it to fellow yelpers! Cheers!",

They have 7 day a week half of drinks and appetizer happy hour. I ordered a beer Josie a Mango margarita. Both arrived promptly. Josie had a chicken taco and I ordered a Beef chimichanga. Chimichanga for me was really tasty. The guacamole was quite good. It was a smaller portion than most Mexican restaurants but that is good I did not leave overly full or waste leftover food. The staff was ON IT. Never had empty water. Bonus!! I recommend this place can't  wait to try other dishes. I also liked the fact that many regulars came in and were greeted by name and staff came through to say hi to the regulars. Have to say, best experience I have had eating in quite awhile.",

Once we ordered , we received fideo soup which I could have eaten 5 bowls of.    I ordered a shrimp chimichanga w veggies and my hubby ordered a carne asada burrito.  Both of us cleared our plates!    My first margarita was a little strong and just ok. But it was happy hour so it was good for the price.

It wasn't very busy at all but yet after 10 minutes we had to ask for someone to come over to us. Everything took forever and one guy even sat at a table to talk to a girl instead of working . The guy who took our order kept asking things over and over about our order so I told him he should write it down but he didn't and our order was all wrong. We couldn't get a refill on chips or salsa. I couldn't even get my water refilled.

The staff is so friendly from the minute you walk in the door to the time you leave.  You get a lot of value for your dollar.  I give it a thumbs up, all the way.",

    "text": "Me and my husband decided to try this New Mexican Restaurant (despite already having a \"usual\" Mexican place we frequent). We showed up 10 minutes before they closed and honestly expected a little rushing on their part perhaps a little attitude .... I know how it is when customers come in minutes before closing when you're expecting to start clean up and get out of there. However, we were treated very patiently and kindly by the hostess, waiter and busier. We were really hungry and they brought out chips, salsa, retried beans, and grilled onions and peppers! It was great. I was even more pleased to see that they had a section on the menu for vegetarians!! I was thrilled! We got our food rather fast, it looked great and tasted great. Serving size was perfect and we were able to take home leftovers. Bathrooms were clean, restaurant had an overall pleasing atmosphere. Hubby and I decided to make this our new home Mexican restaurant!",

The best part is after you get served your chips and salsa, you get a cup of yummy fideo soup which is a great complimentary starter to your meal. There are big screen TVs there so you can watch the game while you eat, there is a separate bar area and a dance floor. The wait staff try very hard to be attentive. It can be hit or miss depending on who you get and how busy it is, but if you are not quite happy or if there is a something amiss they do not hesitate to try to fix it. Luckily, there were no big issues, just a misunderstanding with our fajitas for two. I wanted the shrimp cooked separately and not mixed in with the steak fajitas. They offered to remake the meal, but we declined and ate it anyway and it was delicious. Try this place, it a new business that is working very hard to make a great impression on every single customer.",

The happy hour margaritas were so sweet that we had to send them back.    They brought us new ones which were better but still not very good.   The chips were ok,  but the salsa, beans and the sauteed jalapenos and onions were really good and a great idea.   It took a long time for someone to take our order and the place was empty except for one other table.

The burrito was very filling for the price, if you don't eat too much, two people could have shared the burrito. We ended up with a lot of to go.  Prices The Burritos were all about $12.95. In my opinion, it was a little bit pricey for a casual lunch.  Service The service was great. They also have complementary chips and salsa for us which was great for us when we were talking and waiting for the food to arrive.  Overall The food was good and met my expectation. The price was a little bit pricey so unless you want to spend $10+ for a burrito, might want to consider ordering something else or sharing with a friend. Otherwise highly recommend for some tasty mexican food when you want to avoid the fast food places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle.",

Some of our favorites are the Beef Taquitos, the Table Side Guacamole, the Shrimp Ceviche and those wonderful roasted Jalapenos and onions they serve for free when you first sit down.  Portions are big, we always end up eating too much, but food is just so good you can't help but stuff your face. Margaritas are fantastic too.

I've been coming to JFF (Juans Flaming Fajitas) for over 3 years now (sorry this is my first review). Before I had even visited JFF I had this image of a robertos type place and oh, was I wrong! It is very spacious, family-style restaurant and it can seat parties of 20-30 (I've been to 3). An authentic feature is that they make their own tortillas in the restaurant while you're dining.  I have brought every family member, friend, coworker, and even my dog to JFF. Yes...you can dine with your pooch on the patio (just let them know before hand and they'll let you and your pup in the side entrance). I have never heard a complaint about the quality of the food, the presentation, or the pricing from any of the several affiliates I have introduced to the JFF family. I often get invites from people I brought to JFF asking me to join them there because they are now JFF (Juan's Frequent Flyers).  About a month ago I was entertaining family on the strip and while chatting it up with a bartender at a well know Mexican restaurant, she actually mentioned JFF as the best place for locals! That just speaks for itself. I'm excited that they'll be opening another location soon.",

    "text": "After seeing so many of my friends check in to this place and proceeded to give it no less than 4 stars, I knew it had to be good. Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!  So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entree comes out.   So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place \"Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina\". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sauteed veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it.   As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.  So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!",

It was my parents and I first time trying this place, and it did not disappoint. The place was packed, so we had a 10 minute wait. When we sat down we were given salsa and chips and soup. We ordered the steak fajitas for two that came with beans and rice. It was $28 so I think it's a great offer! When the food came out the presentation of the fajitas was amazing! The portions are pretty large so it's quite filling and really flavorful and tasty! If you love Mexican food than this is the place to go! I love the variety of the menu so when I come back I will try more things off the menu, this place gets my seal of approval.",

There is usually a wait to get in which alone should tell you it's pretty great. Highly recommend the queso dip! Fajitas are yummy, you definitely get your money's worth here as the drink prices are very reasonable as well. The only thing that sucked was the waiting area is way too small and you have to be inside to hear them call your name but it's pretty cramped with people and is uncomfortable. The Host, Waiter and Bussers were so awesome. Overall will be back again and again and again!!",

The server brought our rice and beans and the fajitas without the cactus. We politely explained that it want what we ordered and wanted the cactus in the fajita and the vegetables not the rice and beans. The fajitas smelled and looked great. She took the fajita back and the rice and beans. We waited another 20 minutes for the right order to come out. It seemed as though they literally re-cooked that same steak with the cactus ... the steak was burnt and dry and the vegetables were over heated and dry. They should have cooked a fresh meal but instead basically served that same order but te heated it and added the ingredients ... this altered the quality of the food greatly - the bill was over $50 which was ridiculous considering the burnt food I couldn't even consume.",

When we finally got seated, it looked like there had been people already at the table as there was plates, waters, and chips/salsa already setup. Drinks were served promptly and the meal was out quick. My friend and I did the 2 Fajita share with chicken and steak. We also ordered a few drinks. The white queso dip was phenomenal. After a little bit of time, the manager came over and asked for us to move and be reseated to a different location within the bar. I have never, at a restaurant, been asked to be moved to another table after a certain time. Now, we were comped a $5.00 off next visit on the next meal, but after being asked to move, my friend and I promptly left the restaurant.  If you are looking for some great mexican food, this is the place, but be wary of the service coming here. The parking is a little rough at this restaurant too. There is limited spaces.",

She could just give us the steamed veggies on the side and I would have been fine. Not trying to come off as entitled to get asked what I want, but I feel like she was not trying to help the situation.

I'd pick Lindo's over this any day.",

    "text": "I've tried this new place several times now so I figured it was time to write a review! I'm a big fan of fajitas and Juan's does it right! The veggies are really good and the seasoning is tasty. Best of all, the kitchen uses high quality meat and it shows. If you don't want beans and salsa, they'll sub a very hearty portion of garlic butter vegetables that are really yummy!   The tableside flaming fajita show is a lot of fun for kids and adults. It's a neat gimmick. I do think the portion size on the fajitas for 2 is a bit small; you are better off paying a little extra and order your own fajitas.   The chips are pretty good and the salsas are tasty. I really like the bean dip, it's my favorite. The service has always been absolutely amazing. Out of the few times I've dined here, only once did it take a super long time for our food to come out of the kitchen. I don't know what was going on, but it took over 30 minutes. Usually they are pretty fast, making this a great spot to grab a quick and healthy meal before going to a movie, out shopping, etc.   I only have two criticisms for the place: 1, make the portion size on the \"fajitas for 2\" a bit larger and 2, I wish the kitchen would serve homemade tortillas. The tortillas are so bad I usually ask for none to be brought to the table.   Overall, the restaurant is cute and comfortable, the prices are fair and the food is good. What's not to like?",

The restaurant is huge and provides the perfect setting for a variety of purposes. There is a spacious dining room, perfect for families and date-nights. There is even a stage, and when we visited, they had a live mariachi. There is a bar area with one gigantic and several smaller screens, perfect for all your sports viewing. And, then they have a spacious patio, perfect for basking in the perfect Vegas sun. They also have a daily happy hour from 3-6pm that can be enjoyed anywhere in the restaurant. It features food items and $1 off adult beverages.   From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted with smiles and genuine service. Everyone who visited our table was clearly concerned with ensuring we had an enjoyable experience.  And we did! First, I thought the salsa was delicious, and I appreciated it was actually spicy versus the mild you typically receive. In addition to salsa, you receive bean dip and grilled onions and jalapenos. Meals also come with fideo soup.   We had to go with the flaming fajitas for two, and we decided to sample beef, chicken and pork. They are happy to split up the meat. We were told by two separate employees that the meats are marinated for 48-hours, and I believe them. All of the meats were tender, juicy and flavorful. For the first time I can remember, my husband and I actually finished fajitas for 2!   Considering every detail of the experience, it is definitely worthy of 5-stars. I am sure we'll be adding it to our regular rotation!",

Modest serving size (even for lunch) and not much in the way of anything special in regard to taste. Average at best except for the table side presentation which accounts for the higher than average \"3\" rating.",

Started with Peach and Mango Margaritas.  For food we ordered the JFFC's Nachos, Queso Fundido and Shredded Beef Taquitos.  Food and drinks were great.  By the time we left we tried all 5 of the flavored margaritas and loved each one.  Can't beat the price of just over $5 (+.55 for flavored).  Service wasn't the best.  We felt rushed even though there was plenty of room of open tables.  Even with the service issues still a good choice for Happy Hour.",

We were seated quickly and the waiter didn't delay in taking our orders. The food came out so quickly! Our waiter continued to check in on us and refill drinks well before necessary.   I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas and loved them. The flavor of the shrimp and vegetables was delicious. The tortillas were warm and soft. The sides that go with the fajitas were tasty as well and I really liked the guacamole. The salsas and grilled vegetables that come out with the chips before the meal were all great too.  Something unique to this restaurant was the option to get healthy options. Fajitas can be ordered with romaine lettuce instead of tortillas and rice and beans can be substituted for steamed vegetables. I love when restaurants offer healthy alternatives.",

It's a chance for us to go over the success and failures in an effort to make our events better each year. But mostly we like to have a few drinks, good food and chat. We had heard a lot of buzz about how great this place was so we braved a Friday night 30 min wait for a table of 4. Considering we were in an active conversation throughout the experience, the server did a great job of getting us what we needed. Everyone enjoyed their Margaritas (5 star), there were a few fun flavors to choose from, my cohorts got creative but I went with the classic Cadillac. The food is where they fell flat. It wasn't bad, just not great. There are so many really great Mexican restaurants in the valley I can afford to be that picky. All in all I'm going to revisit them on a slower night to see if they were just a little off.",

The outdoor seating was closed off for a private event that seemed to only be hosting a few people so there were a lot of empty seats not being used. And groups were showing up after we'd been waiting and getting seated before us so there seemed to be preferential treatment to regulars or people the hostesses knew (we were told they don't do reservations or waiting lists). Once we were seated everything was great. No complaints whatsoever about the food and honestly the best horchata I've ever had. We came three hours before a show we had tickets for and because of the wait to be seated and then service being backed up we nearly missed the show so I'd say come when you don't have plans for anything afterwards.

But when you put the fajitas in the spotlight, they are flavorless and dry. Paying $16 for an bland entree served along with rice, beans, tortillas, sour cream, salsa, and guac, is pretty much an do it yourself burrito. I would rather go to an fast food Mexican spot to indulge myself with an carne aside burrito that can satisfy your palate with flavor. I'm glad I gave this place a chance, as the curiosity will no longer be.",

We recommend going before the 5 o'clock rush, however, if you don't want to have a long wait.  We were able to get right in, get a great table and enjoy our meal.  Servers and team members are on point and do their job, without being intrusive.  Food is always good, and we highly recommend it!",

I was amazed that we not only were served chips, salsa and a delish bean but also a tasty plate of roasted peppers and grilled onions. Amazing!! Lupe was our waitress and she was  terrific.  Very attentive and just a doll.  I had Poblano mole steak and it was so delicious.  Very generous portion.  My husband had the Carne Asada  and he enjoyed it very much.  Friendly service, delicious food, generous portions at reasonable prices.  Highly recommend!!",

Best of all, a margarita is only $3.75 during lunch! Scored!! I also love that they serve their chips and salsa with a bean dip and grilled onions and jalapenos. Friendly service all around.

The service is always excellent, the food has never disappointed and the complimentary chips and salsa are easily worth the trip alone. The atmosphere is fun and lively, there are TV screens showing sports mostly but you can still hold a conversation.  The only downside to this place is that sometimes there can be a wait. They will quote you 20 to 30 min, which is reasonable for a great place like this, but you will usually only wait 10 to 15.   My advice for this place is to come hungry because will definitely leave full!",

As for starter we ordered Pozole, it had so much flavor in it, and the meat was tender. We ordered a alcoholic drink which was the Micheladas for about $8-9 can't remember?  For our final entree we got the fajitas for two combination of shrimp and steak. They do live for their restaurant name for \"flaming fajitas\" as it put on a fire show infront of our table as they served it. It came with your choice of rice and beans with pico de gallo for two. The meats were not bad but not the best I ever had. Overall the service was great always checking on us, and the environment has a good warm welcoming feeling.   Will come back again soon to try some of their enchiladas. They do offer 15% off for checking in which saved me a ton.",

This place smelled so good the moment you entered the doors.  We all tried their flaming fajita which is what they were known for. As the dishes come out they come sizzling and the server lights up the fajitas and it was flaming!  Ordered the steak and shrimp fajita and the flavors were on point! The plate didn't really burn the meat or shrimp and it was not over cooked. The servers were very friendly and even brought out a special hot sauce for us which just added a habanero mouth water king kick to our fajitas !  I will definitely want to come back and try their happy hour menu! This is also a great place to bring guests who are coming in town to visit.",

I think the tortillas are homemade and the side dishes are always fresh and good.  The drinks are well done too.  It does get busy and sometimes there's a short wait.  Parking can be a pain because it's so busy but this is a very well run restaurant that serves amazing fajitas at an affordable price.  UPDATE: We're still eating here regularly; food and service better than ever! I'd say one of the best run restaurants in Vegas- really amazing; highly recommend!",

We waited five minutes to be seated and within a minute one of the servers placed two different salsas, refried beans, and fresh tortilla chips on our table and took our drink orders. Im one of those guys that goes through three glasses of soda during my meal and not only did my glass never go empty, they refilled it when it was only half way gone. The service is unbelievable! I ordered the lunch special and opted for the carne asada burrito and the chicken taco. I've never had carne asada this good. Tender, juicy, hot, with just the right amount of spice as to not overpower the meat. The chicken taco was also delicious and juicy. My wife chose the chile relleno and she loved it as well. She kept saying the word authentic (She was born in Mexico City) and that this tasted like a meal her mother and grandmother would make. The only downside to our visit was we got so full that we didn't save enough room for desert and we wish we should have because they looked amazing. I can't say anything more about this place other than you should stop reading and go in.",

LOL It's family owned and the owner always walks around to make sure everyone is doing okay. The food is amazing. The service is awesome! They're always super fast to bring out our food. I'm sad because we are moving in about a month - our house now is right next to this place and our new home is farther away. You better believe though we will be driving the extra miles though just to come and eat here. My favorite restaurant!",

Waiting area is small and felt in the way with people going in and out. We were actually seated in 10 minutes! Had the table right in front of where they make the tortillas! This was great for our almost 3 year old. Wait staff was grand; never had an empty drink! Chips and salsa were wonderful! Added bonus was the grilled veggies that came first! Ordered steak fajitas for two (loved the fact you could choose rice and bean or veggies) and a children's quesadilla (had choice of rice and beans or french fries)! Fideo before entree was another added bonus!  All food was amazing! Kids started to argue over the one orange slice so asked waiter for another one, he brought six! Fantastic place and we will definitely drive all across the valley again to come back!",

My Pacifico was cold and came with lime, the fideo soup was exceptionally good, and the carne asada burrito tasted like heaven.

You can get beer & cocktails starting around $3.50 during HH. You get free chips & salsa, but don't fill up too much because their portions are pretty big. Each entree can feed 2 people. They are very good on refills too.. when you are not even half way done with your drink, they come by & fill it up for you.   You definitely need to try their staple, Flaming Fajitas. They set fire to it at your table! Also, let them know when it's your birthday.. you will get some tasty caramel churros on the house!  Don't forget to Check-in to get $5 off $50.",

Be sure to stop in for happy hour sometime for great margaritas and good deal on beer.  Food offerings on HH special are prefect especially for cheese lovers - go with the Juan's sampler or Juan's nachos to share for the table, otherwise it'll end up being your dinner. I've also come in for brunch and their breakfast burrito offerings are excellent!  Brunch meals even come with a beverage",

I probably would have enjoyed more if I would have actually ordered fajitas. But I got the fajita chimichanga with chicken. I would return to try more options. The margarita was good and so was desert!",

It was on the happy hour appetizer specials.  Next time, we'd choose guacamole instead.  Entrees were a combo platter of a burrito and an enchilada.  Both were very good. The best thing we got, however, was the fajitas.  Very authentic and very good food.  We will definitely be returning.",

We ordered the chicken fajitas - they were juicy, flavorful, and the spectacle of the flames made them even more enjoyable. (One other thing to note: one order was requested to be well done, and the other wasn't; the restaurant did an excellent job of cooking those two and they even came out at the same time). The free soup was good, too. I was definitely a big fan of the salsa since it didn't have huge chunks in it and it also had a little kick.   But, the main selling point of this place was the customer service. Every staff member we interacted with was kind and attentive, bringing the sides/condiments we needed with no wait. We never even had to ask for water refills or extra tortillas; they were always on top of things. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in how our experience was, as well.  Just as we thought it couldn't get any better, our waiter returned with a complimentary churro dessert to commorate our first visit! It was an extremely kind gesture - this place really knows how to lure in customers and keep them coming! Make sure you visit this place if you're looking to be treated well and eat the most delicious fajitas on this side of town.",

The view from the patio is non-existent, so if you're looking for that type of ambiance, this is not your place. If you want great friendly service, awesome food, a welcoming atmosphere and a fun time out - THIS IS YOUR PLACE. Tried a bunch of things on the menu, never had a bad meal or bad service ever. The drinks are good too, everything is very reasonably priced. It's also super close to the 215, so it's not far off the beaten path to get to or go from. Recommendation; if you are going out after dinner and order the fajitas, sit outside on the patio if you don't want to smell like your delicious dinner.",

The real stand out was the soup, it's excellent, we all complemented on it and the perfect temp didn't go unnoticed.    The place was quite full, understandably, so we opted to be seated in the bar rather than wait. Our mistake, good meal in a noisy chaotic environment, bit of a shame, took some of the enjoyment out of it. Fortunately the food is as good as it is and made it worth while.  Would definitely return given the chance.",

    "text": "BEST. MEXICAN. FOOD. IN. SUMMERLIN!  I saw this place every time I was going up or down Trop (we live nearby) and always wondered how it was.  Our friend told us she loves the place and we had to try it.  Ho-leeee Mo-leeeeeeee.  Their food is amazing. Authentic Mexican (we're from San Diego - we KNOW Mexican food).  I would go on and on and on about their food, but suffice it to say, EVERYTHING is beyond FRESH and DELICIOUS.  They start you off by not only bringing chips (which by the way are really good - not greasy, light and always fresh and hot), they bring you the salsa, some beans and a bowl of fideo soup.  If you haven't ever had fideo soup, you haven't lived.  It's so easy to scarf down those chips, so be careful!  I order the fish tacos - and I swear they make their own tortillas. I keep meaning to ask every time we're there.  If they don't - they're the best corn tortillas you'll ever eat in a restaurant.  My husband usually orders tacos, enchiladas, or burritos, and he's always loved what he's got.  Never one complaint about the food. And I'm picky.  Especially with Mexican.  I grew up eating it in Tijuana.    The best part?  AWESOME wait staff.  Never have to wait for refills, always checking on  you, and always very very pleasant.    Definitely check this place out if you've been curious. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",

I think because I live in So Cal and eat the best Mexican food (LA, SD, OC) of all time my review might not be fair. We literally have the best Mexican food in So Cal. It's hard to compete with the Mexican restaurants and taco stands in LA.   But this place has some legit food don't get me wrong. Service was also on point. Our server was very attentive and nice.   THE FOOD: I got the Shrimp and Steak Fajitas. It was good. Shrimp was better than the steak. Steak was a tad bland and being on the flame grill was a little overcooked.   My dad, mom and sister also got the Steak Fajitas and they felt the same. Nothing spectacular. But still good.   We all shared the Ground Beef Nachos. We all liked this dish. Very good appetizer.   This place definitely has a variety of more authentic Mexican plates with Pork, Chicken, Fish, and Beef as well as the more Americanized things like Tacos, Enchiladas and Burritos. So there's something here for everyone.",

Juan's is known for the fajitas and it's because they are awesome. We had the shrimp fajitas for 2: Grilled onions and bell peppers garnished with sour cream, guacamole, beans, pico de gallo and corn or flour tortillas. Served with sopa de fideo.   Grilled peppers, onions, chips, salsa and bean dip are standard starters.  Without hyperbole I can say these are the best fajitas in town, the shrimps are large, plump, and perfectly cooked and the veggies are fresh and tasty.  Happy hour appetizers are outstanding-the queso fundido is excellent and the Mexi fries with Chile Colorado, Diced beef cooked in red chile sauce are a decadent double fried treat, think Mexican poutine!  Service is friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. The decor is warm, clean, and comfy. The staff does a great job accommodating customers even at peak times when they are crowded. A popular place that does an excellent job.",

    "text": "Introduction:  I come here a minimum of once a week, no clue why took me so long to write this review.They have the best fajitas and 2nd to Javier's on their Carnitas, except a third of Javier's pricing.  Quality: 5/5 I usually have the Chicken Fajitas, which is OUTSTANDING.  However, their fish fajitas is even better if you like fish. My friend love their Carnitas, once again, it's way up there and we go to Mexican restaurants quite often.  Furthermore, they have amazing chips and salsas. The green one is to die for and their grilled onions & Jalepenos that serves  with the chips are also outstanding.  Customer Service: 5/5 Exceptional! From the moment you walk in, they acknowledged you loud and proud and makes you feel super welcome.   In addition, all their waiters and waitresses are Superb as well. They're both, patience (if you are picky like me) and very friendly.  Atmosphere: 5/5 I must say due to the friendliness and how accommodating everyone is, the atmosphere itself is great. From the volume of the musics to their playlist choices are also great. Makes you feel you're authentically and legitimately in Mexico.  The only thing I don't really care for is that you walk out smelling like fajitas, but that's not their fault cause they're so darn good that everyone and their mom is ordering them. So rating on everything else when it comes to atmospheres, it's an easy 5 stars rating.   Quantity: 5/5 Two words, too much. Yes, that's possible,  I am not complaining cause I always have enough to take it to go for next day's lunch or dinner & then some.  Price: 5/5 For what you're getting, service, atmosphere and their general portions, another easy 5 stars to give. Even minus the portions, they still get 5 stars cause their service and quality is that great.   Tips: They get very busy depending on the time of day you're going.  However, they are super organized and moves really fast. Definitely 110% worth the wait.",

From the chips and salsa to bean dip to ceviche to fajita's  All was so good and fresh tasting. They take such good care of you that you can notice!  La familia That's how it is, that's how it feels  It was our first time there but we'll definitely be back. Thank you Juan's for a great and delish experience. The food comes out quick and steaming hot! The smell is great and so is the restaurant itself. Muchas gracias por todo :)",

    "text": "Worst experience today at Flaming Fajitas! I have been here many many times before, but I have never sat at the bar. Maybe that was my mistake.   I ordered a skinny margarita (from Flaco) to start which was extremely weak and I could not taste one drop of tequila. Then I waited and waited and waited for the bartender to acknowledge me so I could ask him to make it into a Cadillac (add grand marnier) and I also asked for a shot of tequila on the side as well so I could make it stronger. He took the margarita and added grand marnier but never gave me the extra shot.   Then the busser came over to drop chips and dips...my husband said, \"oh, we didn't need any chips\" because we told the bartender we wanted veggies to dip instead, and the busser walked away taking everything else with him as well. Then when my husband told him we only didn't want chips and we will take everything else, he got an attitude with him and myself like it was too much to ask.   Then we ordered queso fundido with mushrooms and corn tortillas. We received flour tortillas and we had to wait again quite a while for an acknowledgement by the bartender saying that we wanted corn tortillas...meanwhile cheese getting cold......he brings 3 corn tortillas, great! (There are 2 of us) So we eat two tortillas and then are waiting for an acknowledgement again....cheese is getting colder.....by this time, the cheese is too cold to eat because employees at Flaming Fajitas obviously can't do simple math and see that we are two people and maybe, just maybe, we would prefer an even number of tortillas. Also maybe, we would like enough to finish this damn cold cheese!!   I think I'm done with this place. There are too many other superior Mexican restaurants in Vegas to eat at without having to deal with clueless employees.",

They do run a happy hour special with five dollar margaritas. I will say, the margaritas for happy hour are weak. So I upgraded to the Cadillac peach margarita and it was awesome! Definitely worth the extra few dollars. The queso with chorizo was heavenly. It came with fresh warm flour tortillas and the portion was huge! It could feed three people. I was impressed also with the chips and salsa - the chips were fresh and thin which I really like. The fried onions and jalapenos that come with the chips is a nice complement. They were well seasoned and very tasty. I did not try the fajitas but they looked great, maybe next time!",

In fact, the fajitas were AMAZING. The best I have had in a very long time. The sopapilas were a great follow-up as well.  Definitely save room for dessert!  The service was quick and friendly.  Much appreciated. Very laid back atmosphere.  If you like Mexican food, I highly recommend coming here.  Bring your appetite!",

This past visit, the three of us had the combo fajitas plate for two, the happy hour chicken nacho plate, two glasses of house Cabernet and two large beers for....$67 total. Great price plus left overs!!   5 Stars AGAIN for food 5 Stars for CONSISTENT customer service from the door to the bar to the server. ALWAYS!!   I've always had a great experience. Tv's to watch sports, patio, safe parking lot, VERY family friendly.   Busy main street nearby so just watch when entering or leaving the parking lot. I suggest exit and enter on the slow residential street.   Check out my pics for the fajitas arrived bing to your spot at the bar or table.   If your vacationing in Red Rock/Summerlin area, and you have a desire for very good Mexican food...you'll be very happy.",

Of course it wouldn't be called Juan's Flaming fajitas without the fire show that accompanies it. It's worth getting it every time just for that lol. Portions are huge and very shareable.   Also worth noting is their happy hour everyday from 3-7. Plenty of food and drink options and a perfect place to just relax and unwind after a crazy week or day at work. It's a suitable place to have a get together with friends or to celebrate something. Reservations for large parties recommended obviously, they don't really like splitting checks but they'll work with you if you do it in groups. All in all a solid 4 and a place I see myself returning to over and over again.",

Waiter took our order right away, drinks came next and our food was up shortly after.

    "text": "I was VERY uninspired about coming here due to the very cheesy name they chose for the place but I was made wrong once I ate here.    Pulling up to the location sucks and the parking lot is a nightmare due to In N Out burger sharing the same parking lot with them so make sure you plan ahead. Inside the waiting area isn't that larger so patrons are forced to wait outside the restaurant with no added seating while you wait for your seat.    Food is rather tasty and for what it is you'll be happy. The guacamole was super fresh, cold and seasoned well; as were the salsas they place on the table. Fajitas are really good and they're highly recommended.   Service was decent but could use some more training on table maintenance to ensure you have a full beverage, clean plates and utensils.  All in all good place to grab some grub",

Yesterday however we went and everything was horrible there were people seated after us and got there meal way before us by the time mine got there and it wasn't even correct I asked for a to go box. Our waitress brings me a dirty ( used container) and when I asked for a clean one she laughed and said oh sorry about that. The whole experience was just terrible and being a customer  for years I just feel like it might be time to branch out and find another local Mexican restaurant to go to.  Very Ok so we went back glad we did service and food were back to the quality we have become accustomed to receiving. Amber your amazing!!!  Thanks for caring about the customer.",

    "text": "Arrived during a weekend night for my birthday dinner.  The foyer was packed with patrons waiting for a table. Thanks to Terri R who made reservations days in advance. Once we told the hostess who we were they immediately took us to our table that already had  menus, place settings, plus we each had our own chips, bean dip and salsa already set on the table! I had brought some cupcakes and the host offered to store in their refrigerator as well. What nice start!  Menu featured their signature Flaming Fajitas, with choice of beef, pork,chicken or shrimp. You can do an individual order or a combo for two which included your choice of 2 meats. The latter being the better deal at $25.95. The extensive menu also included combination plates, vegetarian dishes, specialty entrees, tacos and enchiladas.  Mr. B. got an order of tacquitos for appetizers. It was an unexpectedly huge order too.  This alone could be a meal. It sure was plenty to share with our group. The complimentary bean dip was my favorite side. The beans whipped smooth and delicious!  It was quite addicting.    So our orders of the flaming fajitas were presented at the same time. All three were lighted simultaneously right at our table. Flames shooting a good 3 feet! You could even feel the heat! (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FjGA9r1jSB9%2F&s=470f09384baf5e305c011dcfa525be3b7f8e81be1b705d4c4d3845477a2ac50a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/p/jGA9r1jS...</a> ) It went out like a flash and charred the fajitas perfectly. The beef was tender, well marinated, good southwest flavor and seasoning. Grilled onions and green peppers were right texture as well. We each had our fajitas in sterno heated griddles that kept our fajitas sizzlin throughout our meal.  Service from beginning to end..MUY BIEN! Great teamwork by all staff. They were not only gracious enough to store my birthday cupcakes, little did I know my awesome friends also had a birthday cake for me which they not only stored but they provided the candles and brought out the cake lit up and sang HBD, maracas, sombrero and all!  Atmosphere was festive and family friendly. Large dining area, can accommodate large groups. The bar is in a separate section. It's also cool place to watch sports with tvs around the dining area.   So summing it all up:   Festive + FUNtastic + Foodielious Flaming Fajitas + F(ph)enomenal Friends + Forty Niners(cake <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fphoto%2FYUjPn82nej6E1xy5M4Wtdw%2Fl.jpg&s=5eccc2133ab9bfa54a478937e1690aebd95018f6b095ae72dc8846c7caf6434f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>) = FIVE Star FAB Fifty Birthday dining experience!",

Need say more its all in the name of the restaurant. I never ordered the Flaming Fajitas. I felt like constant bonfires going off every five mins looking around the restaurant. So really hard not too order the star or show stopper but thankfully bunch of us so got too watch the show up close. I heard about looked and smelled great everyone said that it was really good.   What I did order was the Carne Asada Burrito. I loved it! The portion size is huge. I know its mexican restaurant so that really should not come as shocker. I felt like you got nice portion of rice and beans. Not only the size but everything on the plate had great flavors and really really good. The Carne Asada meat by itself was fabulous! The thing was the burrito was packed with meat more meat and went with the red not green chili.  The meat was nice, moist, well seasoned, and use base carne asada any style taco, burrito, or whatever be in Carne Asada heaven. The rice and refried beans had nice flavor. Sometimes go mexican restaurant taste very bland or feel like out of can. I felt like both sides freshly made each day. The guacamole was nice.   The chips and salsa start up with highly ADDICTING. The chips were nice, Hot, fresh and crispy. The salsa too the warm bean dip. Be warned might want too take it easy on the chips before your meal. No room for entree.  The service was awesome. We brought in two different desserts from outside businesses. They still more then happy too keep them refrigerated in the back until we finish with dinner. Missing candles they found two candles for us. The whole they never raised stink eye about us bringing outside stuff. The staff guess birthday they sing happy birthday and the birthday person gets too wear sambrero. We slowly but in time we all showed. I felt like they never rushed us too turn over our big table. Never empty glass of beverage or chips on our table the whole night. They more then happy too split our checks. Talk about reasonable family friendly prices. It been while since went too mexican restaurant but here at Juan Flaming Fajitas one that see coming back many more times.!!!!!!",

Originally from Southern California, Mexican food is not only a staple in my life, but it's also my favorite.   The low down:  Viva Mercados USED to have the greatest food, but they closed. Flaming Juan jumped onboard and kept the recipes and food alive in this new location and name. Viva Mercados eventually re-opened in a new location, but the food is awful. Like seriously terrible.   Bottom line:  Flaming Juan (yes I realize that's not the name technically, but this is MY review lol) has done a great job at reviving an almost lost and the ONLY decent Mexican cuisine in this dust bowl of a valley.   Favorites: Complimentary Fideo soup, green chicken tamale, fajitas (any kind), avocado tostada, happy hour specials, and anything with carne Asada.   The staff is usually very kind. Especially Juan (waiter, not manager), and Amanda. They're the best waiters.   * disclaimer * they've recently changed their bean dip and they need to change it back. It's missing something, maybe the pork it used to have, I'm not sure but that's the first sign of bad news if any.",

We watched a server clean the table with a rag from God knows where - without sterilizing the table. The veggies tasted like rubber & had no flavor. It's like they just microwaved the veggies...all in all, not clean & food was not worth $40 spent...Left extremely disappointed.",

My kids ate off the kids menu cheese sandwich which was on torta bread and my daughter had the taquitos. She loved the rice. Oh and the soup was very good as well. Service is outstanding very attentive. We had to wait a while for the food however they apologized to us. We also got churros not sure if that comes to everyone or due to our wait but better then Disney. Can't wait to go back",

They carry Tecate in the bottle and that's my favorite beer period.  They give you Fideo soup (it's a tomato based soup with angel hair pasta) as a free appetizer.  I ordered the Steak Fajitas and shared it. It was great.  I took the advice of another Yelp user.  If it's in the name, order it.  I was not disappointed.  One of my other family members ordered Carne Asada and it came out a little dry and bland.  I've had that problem before with other Mexican restaurants so it's not that big of a minus.  Ideally, Carne Asada should be cooked well done and still come out flavorful and not dried out.    One of my kids had Chicken fingers and fries. The fries were a little over cooked. But as I usually say, you don't go to a Mexican restaurant for chicken fingers.  But like most smart Mexican restaurants, they put that on the kids menu for the kids who aren't craving Mexican food at the same time everyone else is.  I will come back again and try some of the other items on the menu.  Order the fajitas if it's your first time, you can't go wrong.",

We had about a 30 minute wait for a table which was not a big deal. So my mom and I went to the bar to order my first drink as a 21 year old. The people at the bar were super friendly and made it fun. The margaritas were super bomb, too. We got seated on the patio and our server was Christian. He was an absolute amazing server and made the night even funnier than it already was. He was on top of everything and just added in to how crazy and loud my family is. I love servers who know how to have fun with a family like mine. The food was awesome and I loved the experience. I'll definitely be coming here on my Friday's for a margarita and some queso dip lol.

The company was great. We always have a fun time.   The service was good, above average. However, $15.95 for beef, chicken or pork fajitas seems high to me. ($1 extra for shrimp). For a combo it's $25.95 (again a buck more for shrimp). The side of guac and sour cream wasn't enough (I mean is there ever enough sour cream? Me thinks not). The fajita's tasted OK. But, for a place that specializes in them, I thought they'd have more wow. They serve horchada which I love. And even that didnt impress me. It tasted weak and strong on cinnamon.  They do serve complimentary chips, salsa and beans. I happened to like the beans, but the salsa wasn't good. I wouldn't say it's expensive necessarily, but it's certainly not cheap food. I wont say I'll never come back, but it's not a place I'll be back any time soon.",

Some of the highlights:  Import Draft Beers: $3.50 for 16oz or $4.50 for 20oz Well Drinks: $3.50 Margaritas: $3.50 for 12oz or $4.50 for 16oz Fajita Quesadillas: $6.95  Come in during happy hour, and for around $20 or so you can have quesdillas, free chips and salsa/beans, and three drinks.  Not bad at all.  Outside of happy hour I've had their fajitas: beef, chicken, pork, and shrimp.  The fajitas are decent, but not necessarily something to go out of your way for.  The fajitas for two combo is about $25, which really can be enough for three people if you keep snacking on the chips and dips.  Again, not really good enough to warrant going out of your way for, especially since they close pretty early.  Fridays and Saturdays they close at 10:00pm, the rest of the week they close at 9:00, so unless you're in the area you'll want to be sure to come here early.",

The bar is separate from the main part of the restaurant so it's more quiet if you like that. Drinks were great too. Bathrooms were very clean which speaks highly of the staff and management.

The steak melts in your mouth and is so tender and the peppers and onions were cooked perfect! My husband got the Steak Chimichanga and it was so flavorful and the best we have ever tasted. The margaritas on happy hour are a great deal and we got the Sopapillas for dessert. They were so delicious and made you feel so happy! I would give this place 6 out of 5 stars if I could.

The fajitas were not seasoned in any way. I got the veggies with mine and took one bite... Ugh no flavor either. Tried salt and pepper didn't help. Also how can you mess up fideo soup?!?

I order a chile relleno lunch plate, hubby ordered the chicken asado it was all so flavorful, fresh and made my tummy happy! I ordered a medium sized pozole to go bc the reviews said it was yum.

The hostess recommended I sit in the bar area.  Unfortunately, the table they sat me at was right by the door going out to the patio, so cold air would rush in every time they opened the door.  I ordered a house margarita, which was pretty good.  Chips and 3 types of salsa came out soon after.  The salsa was mild.  I ordered the flaming steak fajitas.  It came out 10 min. later, I was still working on the chips and salsa.  One observation about the fajitas, is that they didn't have a lot of seasoning to it.  Besides that, it was some good fajitas.  My waiter Sebastian was very accomadating.  Other staff members stopped by the table to see how I was doing, I was never left alone.  Probably will go back, next time I'm in town.",

TV's all around, and a great place to spend some time over margaritas and quality Mexican food. You won't be disappointed.",

Great service, too.  We will certainly have to eat here one more time before we leave the area.  We will make sure to come hungry, very hungry!!",

Then our server introduced herself and made us feel welcome and took our drink order. Since it was Happy Hour we had their house made margaritas and was very pleased.  Everything was delicious especially their famous Flaming Fajitas. I opt for the steak fajitas and enjoyed every bite. The meat was well seasoned and wasn't over cook but consistent and flavorful especially the grilled veggies and I was surprised with the portion size for a single serving of fajitas.  My sister and I shared a Flan for dessert and didn't regret it, because it was simply amazing especially since we had one in awhile. The soft texture and not so sweet caramelized sauce was perfect.  Our server Noemi was very friendly and energetic like the majority of the employees including a manager on staff. From the outside it look like an average size restaurant but it's large and broken into three sections: Main Dinning room, Bar room & Patio facing Tropicana. Will be back in the future!",

Now if you want to avoid a wait most of the time you make a reservation. We called to try to make one for 4 people because when we went there last time it was a 40 min wait and that is just ridiculous when you can avoid all of that and make a simple reservation. When we called to ask they said you can't make a reservation unless it's 10 or more people??? So ummm they think people are just going to wait 40 min or more just to eat... I don't think so. Just a suggestion they should definitely let anyone make a reservation no matter how many people are going to be eating.",

I always love that first bite when that beautiful citrus marinated chicken hits my taste buds. The flour tortillas are made in the restaurant. That's always a plus in my book. The margaritas are great but decided to be brave & tried the pina colada margarita. I'm in love! The best of both my flavor worlds! The green salsa is awesome!!! I always ask for an extra side to take home. I don't mind an extra fee-give me a big one. My only complaint is that we don't go as much as we used to because they are always so busy! Good for you Juan!!!",

Well, the time finally came and my boyfriend and I were craving fajitas.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is amazing because this place is HUGE and it was very busy. The staff is all super friendly and everyone we encountered was amazing.  They have a lot of options on the menu, beyond fajitas. We ordered the queso dip to start and went to town on the chips and salsa (big mistake!). We then decided to share the steak fajitas for 2, which is SO much food. I love the presentation - they wheel up a cart to your table and set your fajitas on fire. Pretty cool. Each person gets a plate with beans/rice and sour cream/guac. This was way too much food for us and we ended up taking quite a lot of it home.  I have a theory that there is always room for ice cream, so of course we ended the meal with fried ice cream.  Overall, I really enjoyed our experience at Juan's and we will definitely return!",

But I thought I would throw caution to the wind and also order a fish taco.   So I have never been here before and I show up at 1pm and I am seated in the bar.  Holy cow, if I knew that the chips and salsa and beans and grilled onions and peppers were showing up I would have NEVER ordered so much food.  Either way....... My chimichanga was served with some kind of red sauce on it.  Not like advertised which said it would be served with guacamole and sour cream.  I really did not care for it.  My fish taco was right next to this red sauce drenched chimi, so I couldn't even pick up the taco.  The fish was blah and semi cold.  I was not impressed.   My service was impeccable.  I will be back to give it a second chance.",

Love the two different salsas they serve (one red and mild and the other is greenish and has some heat) with the chips and also the bean dip. My kids eat it with a spoon, it's that good.  My husband and I share the Guadalajara special. It's carne asada covered in melted cheese with shrimp and scallops on top, sitting in a spicy white sauce. It is magical!  We've also split the carne asada a la tampiquena and that is in a red sauce (not spicy at all) with shrimp on top and an enchilada on the side. Also, amazing.  The kids split the carne asada on the kids menu and it's a good amount of meat for a child entree.  I'm scared to give such a good review because it's just going to get busier (parking is a drag), but they deserve it!",

My lady and I were tired of the over priced and underwhelming options on the strip, so we swung out in the rental to hit a few desert parks on the outskirts on Vegas, hitting Juan's for dinner on the way back.  Juan's did not disappoint.  We sat in bar area, as main dining area was full.  Waiter took drink orders immediately after we sat, then after offered good suggestions on the menu items. Another waiter brought a big bowl of chips with 3 different salsa, some melted cheese, some beans, a plate of fried onion, and a plate of nice hot peppers, a nice damn little meal by itself.  An appetizer of ranchers taco's was 6 excellent tortillas fried crispy filled with shrimp.  We both had Jalisco style platters, she had steak Monterey style, loaded with peppers. onions, and monterey cheese, myself the chicken poblano, a deep, dark mole sauce with sesame seeds.  Both came with a cup of soup, beans and rice and were more than ample sized, that we had take out to drop in the cooler for a morning snack in the desert.  Fairly priced, superior customer service by the wait staff and great portions of real hearty Mexican food and non watered down drinks make this a must stop anytime I am in the Vegas area.",

To be honest, we got so full before our entree even came! Hubby and I shared a steak and shrimp fajitas combo. When we sat down, our waitress quickly took our drink order. When she returned, someone also brought chips and salsa. He brought a mini bowl with no spice for our son just in case and a side of grilled onions and jalapenos which was super yummy. We ordered a chicken quesadilla appetizer, which I completely recommend! The quesadilla was HUGE and the chicken was flavorful. Our entree came with a side of fideo soup and they even offered to refill our basket of chips and salsa, but I was already feeling stuffed and our entree hasn't come yet so we declined. I thought I was a nice gesture because from entry, their staff seemed like a we'll oiled machine in customer service. The wait time for all of our food was minimal. The fajitas were superb and it came with a size of tortilla, rice, beans, sour cream, Pico and guac (my choice). I can't wait to come back to try other things on the menu!",

Nobody really enjoyed the food all found it bland and the server refilled my drink wrong. I am not sure what happened from the first time I was here. My dads order was wrong, my food didn't come out as I ordered. He forgot our sides that we had asked. Maybe It just wasn't their day today.  and to make it worse, it was EXTREMELY cold in here. Like everyone was runny nose cold. I was literally freezing. and my dad who keeps the house at 68, was even cold and the man never gets cold.  Everyone is extremely welcoming and nice though.

All of their fajitas come with a noodle soup and your choice of rice, beans, and wraps. The sopa de fideo is delicious.  I had the chicken fajitas.  My friends had the steak and shrimp fajita combo.  They just might be the best fajitas in the world.",

    "text": "I feel like I need to visit this place a 2nd time to give it a good sound review but I really don't know when I would get an urge to come back again. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and although it's only 5 minutes from my home, it has taken me at least a year to finally make the trip. It might be because I've pretty much given hope on Mexican food in Las Vegas and rather just wait till my trips back to Texas to satisfy my cravings. Well unfortunately Juan's Flaming Fajitas has not changed my outlook on Mexican food in this city.  They provide salsa and refried beans with a basket of chips for you to snack on while you wait. I really liked the salsa but I wish it was a bit more spicier. Or just spicy in general. Kudos to them for being on point with switching out our baskets as we were close to running low on chips.   I think these places are smart to provide free chips and salsa because it almost makes you lose track of time of how long your food is getting to the table while you're snacking away, this trickery didn't work on our party though! It took quite some time for us to finally get our food and when it did, 2 of the 4 dishes were already cold leaving it unappetizing -- cold burrito with hardened cheese and soggy fries in the middle? No thanks. 2 of the dishes down, and leaving one of our friends running to the restroom right away. Yikes.  Luckily I was on the (somewhat) winning side of the order. I ordered the Taco Salad which wasn't bad, but how do you really mess up a taco salad anyway? And it sitting out too long doesn't affect it too much, only made my lettuce a little wilted but didn't completely ruin my meal. My friend ordered the fajitas and although it's pretty cool they have it at high flames next to your table, I honestly think it's just for show and does nothing really special for the dish itself other than warm it up again. They then place this giant cauldron with the fajitas sitting on top of it in front of you, taking a large amount of space with little room left for the other people at the table or even (large) side dishes like your beans and rice.   The prices weren't terrible and it seemed as clean as it could be. I don't think this place is an ultimate failure, we just didn't have the best first experience. Sadly it's the first impressions that matter the most right? So I have to confidently say that it will be quite some time till I feel I can go at this again.",

    "text": "AYYYYY MUCHO CALIENTE PAPIIII~!!!!  haha I have been wanting to try this place just because the pictures look so darn cool! Coming in I knew that we just HAD to try the flaming fajitas I mean if it's in the name of the restaurant then you should probably try the dish right? HAHA Walking into the place it's your typical family run Mexican joint nothing fancy but it was very clean and colorful. There is a full bar and patio area to the left and then the main dining room is comprised of both tables and booths.. I even think they have a little dance floor area.   We ordered: -Table-side made Guacamole: ($7.95) They make it exactly to your liking so if it tastes bad it is your own fault! -Chicken & Beef Flaming Combo Fajitas for Two: ($25.95) I don't even like fajitas but these were so good. Good quality meat and you gotta love the little fire show that you get.. I love that the plate is indeed sizzling and pretty much stays sizzling so your meat/onions/peppers stay hot!  -Combo comes with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, rice, beans or you can substitute the rice+beans for VEGGIES yay.. I love how they bring 2 separate plates of these instead of 1 to share between the 2 people! Combo also comes with a choice of corn or flour tortillas (6 total!) -Complimentary Fideo soup which is like a tomato based soup with some noodles.. was a little salty for me but I still liked it! -Complimentary Chips, Salsa & Bean Dip: The chips were mixed with the standard yellow chips and red and green chips.. served warm but not oily.. The salsa tasted fresh and was not too spicy and the bean dip was a little too salty for me but still tasty!  On the menu it says the first round is on the house but that they charge after that.. They asked us if we wanted a refill and I said yes but they didn't charge us so maybe it's 1 per person?   Awesome friendly service from all of the wait staff.. Food took a little bit longer than I had expected but I didn't really notice since I was too busy munching on chips.. I told Juan I found them through Yelp and he said Yelp has really helped them.. I definitely recommend trying this place out.. If you don't like fajitas they have a bunch of other items (no a la cart items though) & they have a daily HAPPY HOUR 3-7!   HOT TIP: print this coupon before you go.. I forgot to print mine so they didn't accept it but oh well haha: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmobileapp.moneymailer.com%2FIcfV2%2FgetIcfImage.aspx%3Fim%3Dsat%26o%3D7ACFE9EB-ADE7-4468-B58D-244231566823%26di%3D%26t%3DHOTPDF%26p%3DF&s=c950cb9bc4236dc86a2460686f679dfa1750930ac2a39f6c93c4ad7a70d0904a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mobileapp.moneymailer.co...</a>",

Portions are too large for an average-sized diner; hence, both my date and I felt guilty for leaving such large portions on the plate.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were sub-par. It's never a good sign when a restaurant uses baby shrimp in their dishes. This means the shrimp is either frozen or purchased cheaply in bulk. Not a lot of flavor in the shrimp but the sauce was pretty good.  My date had the taco salad with chicken and claimed it was okay. Like other reviewers stated, there's nothing necessarily \"bad\" about the food it just seems like your run-of-the-mill place. Nothing remarkable. That said, by the time I finished one taco my date's tostada was getting quite soggy. It was kind of gross.  So, I can't imagine returning unless it's for happy hour when a mariachi band is playing.",

    "text": "Quick tip: If the restaurant is called Juan's Flaming Fajitas, you should order the fajitas.   We came here for our Cinco de Drunko dinner celebrations without any high hopes or expectations. All we were looking for was a Mexican restaurant near the house where we could partake in the national drunk day! Man we hit a jackpot with this joint!  We ordered flaming beef  fajitas (for one) and 3 combo plate (carne asada, pollo asada and carnitas) all tacos.  We got dinner and a show with the fajitas! I'm usually not a big fajita fan because every time I get them the meat is usually dry and rubbery.  Their meat was moist, juicy and full of flavor! (insert gay joke here) The peppers and onions were cooked just right as they still had a little snap to them.   The tacos were decent in both taste and size but could not compare to the flaming fajitas! This place is called Juan's flaming fajitas not Juan's flaming tacos so order accordingly. If the tacos had the same pop as the fajitas this place would be a 5* without question.   The freebie chips and dip were decent. They provided warm beans along with the salsa. One surprise was they provided grilled chilies and onions with the salsa! The chips were nothing special and probably of the bagged variety.   Very friendly and attentive wait staff. We never had to ask for more chips and salsa or to have our water refilled. Our waiter was quick to point out that since it's cinco de drunko that the best bang for our alcoholic buck was the beer margarita since it was only $1 more than a standard margarita. SOLD! No need for up sell here my friend..  I think that we found a new place near our house to get our Mexican and margarita fix.!",

The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars because the fajitas were a bit - well - boring actually.

I could understand if the place was packed and everyone was running around but it wasn't. In fact I saw our server sit down for a few seconds before he jumped up to serve the table by us. The rest of the night unfortunately didn't speed up.  We had to ask for the check after we were obviously done.   The food lacked any flavor.  We had the fajitas. Wow, the worst fajitas I've ever had.  I can make amazing fajitas at home - salt, pepper, a little cumin and spice. Apparently the chef has never heard of spices because he sure did not use any.    Just an overall disappointing experience. I don't go out to eat too often and when I do I expect it to be on par or even better than what I can cook at home.  I doubt I will ever be back.",

Always good, especially during the NCAA tournament (if you are not a Kentucky fan like myself).  Negra Modelo on tap = Sunday Funday.  Although I am a Lindo fan, the chips and salsa at Juan's are much better.  So is the fideo soup.  We decided to split the flaming chicken fajitas because it is the namesake.  Because I will always be 10 years old, I was overly facinated with the tableside flaming fajitas (see pic).  In addition to the show, the fajitas were great.  Came with the aforementioned fideo soup, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, cheese and tortillas.  The only thing I wasn't wowed by were the tortillas, but when your BFF is a latina rockstar and her fabulous momma hooks you up with decilious tortillas, your standards can be pretty high.  Don't worry Lindo.  There's room for two great Mexican spots in the Southwest.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Juan.",

    "text": "I was recently referred to Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina by a friend who was being continuously unimpressed by the taste of the Mexican food in the Las Vegas area.  I found this a little disconcerting being that Las Vegas was essentially a border town of the old west and as the west expanded, Las Vegas continued to maintain the southwest flavor.   Nonetheless, it was a trusted friend, who had turned me on to some other fine establishments, so I decided to give Juan's a try and see why they were set apart from some of the other Mexican favorites in Las Vegas.   Upon entering Juan's you see that the Cantina is set aside to the right.  As much as I enjoy a good Cantina visit, I was here for a lunch date and proceeded into the regular dinning area. Inside the dinning area, I was immediately welcomed with the laughter and good graces of a table of about ten people enjoying a birthday luncheon.   As my friend and I were seated, we were greeted by a team looking to fill our drink order and who promptly brought chips, two salsa bowls (green and red) and beans to the table. I thought this was wonderful, so many restaurants just bring chips and salsa, but then there was more, there was a small dish of onions and sliced jalapeno peppers.  All this just to get us started.    After looking over the menu and the waiter stopping by a couple times, just to make sure he didn't miss out on our desire to order, we made our selections.  My friend ordered the beef taquitos with veggies and I ordered the chicken fajitas with beans and rice.    I don't know if our conversation was just that good or if the service was that prompt, but it seemed like no time at all that our food arrived.  As my friend was served her taquitos and veggies, I knew that I had missed out on a change of pace from the beans and rice, the veggies looked grilled and tasty.    The fajitas were wonderful though, the perfect lunch portion served with three corn tortillas, the perfect amount of chicken and the right ratio of green/red peppers and onions.  All three tortillas were used and there was still a small of chicken left over to munch on.  I really didn't eat the beans and rice, not due to anything wrong with them,but mainly I was sad that I hadn't opted for the healthier veggie option.    The chicken was tender and juicy, with the veggies grilled to the point of almost burnt, just enough to bring out the flavor and the unique flavor that is expected in a fajita dish.   I would say that I am not sure yet that Juan's is better than any other Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, I believe I need to further explore their menu, but I would say that it is as good as some of Las Vegas' other premier Mexican restaurants.   I would also point out that my friend and I stayed an visited for about an 45 minutes after completing our lunch without ever feeling rushed to leave.  I felt the manager and staff were very attentive to our dining needs.   I would certainly recommend Juan's to anyone looking for a relaxing Mexican style lunch in the southwest side of Las Vegas.",

Service is always fast and friendly. Huge projector tv in the bar area. Rolando is a great server, my friend and I usually sit in the bar area and get great service. Friendly owner. The place is nonsmoking (yay!!) and they also have outdoor patio seating.",

Got a raspberry margarita (hh) which was far too sweet and lacked any alcohol... The sopapillas for dessert! Great airy perfectly fried dough with honey and whipped cream.

We came during happy hour and ordered rolled chicken tacos that were only $5. We also ordered a one person chicken fajita to share.    On the house they give you chips and salsa with refried beans. Chips were warm and perfect! Then they give you a tomato sopa that was tasty but a slight salty.   When the fajitas came.... FIREEEE! They put on a cool fire show with your fajitas and it's comes so hot and sizzling! The one person fajita was more than enough for me and my girlfriend. The rolled tacos were okay and kinda greasy.   Actually will come back for more fajitas!",

    "text": "Took Mom here for Father's Day based upon a recommendation from a friend. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you walk in the vibe is quite nice. Definitely the look and feel of an authentic Mexican restaurant. Was a little disappointed that three TV's had the US Open on and not one had on FIFA Women's World Cup.  The place was semi-busy even though we got there when it first opened. They have Coke Zero too so that made the visit that much more awesome. Both Mom and I ordered the shredded chicken taco salad. They came back in less than ten minutes. Now that's fast! But, I have to admit I was skeptical with it coming back that fast. The server mentioned it was a simple process, that's why it was so fast. That didn't help matters for my skepticism.  It was actually pretty good. At first, the taste was not what I was used to. The chicken tasted a little funny, at first. But after a few bites, I couldn't stop eating! Overall it was pretty darn good. And they serve chips, refried beans, salsa, onions and jalepenos while you wait for your food. Good thing because I was starving!  I will definitely come back to try something else on the menu. Until then, four stars. Have to explore the menu. As far as customer service, it was extremely good. And they do not rush you to order or pay, for that matter. Great spot!",

So when we first walked in and saw how busy the place was (there was even a wait!) we were quite surprised!  We were seated within the quoted 10 mins and the moment we sat down, we saw why the word \"flaming\" is in their name! As you can see from the photos, their fajitas are literally shooting out flames up toward the ceiling! They're quite delicious, I guess the flames add a flavor only a flame can add :)  Also on the menu: Table side guacamole, raspberry margarita and a coronita. Good, bomb, and meh. I'd definitely have the raspberry margarita again, damn thing tastes like juice!  We loves. We're returning.",

Although, there are very many different styles of Mexican food and a lot of great hole in the walls, this place beats the best of them. If your on the fence just go!

They let us set up a surprise party for her on their patio. Their staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. If you want to eat good food with a side of A+ service, visit this amazing place.

I had shrimp fajitas - and yes, they were flaming!  My husband had a wet carne asada burrito, and the meat was so tender!  Homemade chips were served with two salsas, bean dip, and grilled onions and jalapeno - yum!  We also had their special margarita on the rocks, and it was absolutely incredible!  Staff was so friendly and attentive, and helped made this a great choice for us out of towners.   A surprise free dessert of warm churros almost made us ask for a cart to take us out - we were stuffed, but so happy!   We liked it so much, we bought a gift certificate for someone at our hotel who did something nice for us - so that shows you how much we liked the restaurant!  On our list for whenever we visit Las Vegas!  **Edit - we went to the restaurant the next day because we enjoyed it so much, and brought two friends with us!  My husband had the Chili Colorado burrito, and IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!  Our friends loved the food and staff too!",

Check your credit card statement with your receipt!  I went there for the first time a few days ago and gave a generous tip of 30 percent. I checked my credit card statement and noticed the restaurant charged an extra $22 in addition to my bill plus tip! I called three times and explained what happened. I was told the owner was the only one who can help me out so I left 3 messages. I was told the owner would call today but when I waited all day and didn't receive a call, I called again and was told the owner left for the day. I got the impression this isn't the first time this has happened.  It's not about the money, it's about the principal and service. A few dollars added to a handful of tabs each month can make for a nice bonus.",

Though the food taste like a million bucks, it was definitely cheap/reasonable, & service is quick & served with a smile. Happy hour drinks was on point as well  lol. The guitar guy walked around and played beautiful mexican music. Everything was perfect and very special as it was my Mothers' birthday. I will most definitely be a returning customer, and this is now our chill & family get together spot. Thank you Mary, Amanda & Pao for making our experience a great one!

Let's face it - most Mexican restaurants are not really authentic but \"Americanize\" their dishes to fit everyone's boring concept of Mexican food.  Not this place!  The food here is the real deal.  Salsas were flavorful and the sauteed onions and chiles were delicious!  We think these were poblano and not jalapeno chiles - very good!  We had green chile and steak picado and both were very tender and yummy!  You can tell that the owners have put some thought into their menu choices and the ingredients they use.  We will recommend this to our friends that live in Vegas and anyone who will be visiting.  Great margaritas and greatfood",

Anyone that I've referred here has loved it and gets hooked as well.  Food recommendations: Have only had steak and chicken fajitas (amazing and a lot of food), taco salad, chicken tacos and ceviche are my go to's. Also love the fact they serve veggies instead of rice and beans upon request. I've never had them but the churro's look great too!   We used to go to viva Mercado in village square and honestly no other Mexican restaurant compares to Juan's.  Wait time at dinner time can be long but nothing a margarita or two can't fix while waiting!!!! :)",

Needless to say this is the THIRD time we have come in the evening to take advantage of the patio and they REFUSE to serve customers out there. Why have a patio and never have it open? They turned away 30 customers. Unbelievable! What a poor decision by management to do that. We even asked to order \"to go\" and eat out on the patio so their precious servers wouldn't have to walk outside. The hostess staff was extremely rude and screamed at our group that they don't serve on the patio! Meanwhile, they do have one table out there getting service. Your service SUCKS! Keep turning away loyal customers and watch your sales dwindle. We will never recommend this restaurant again regardless of the food because the staff is so rude and they continually turn paying customers away.",

The fajitas are the best I've ever had and I love the \"show\" with the big flames when they deliver the fajitas. They don't cut corners and the tortillas are made fresh there. The soup which is part of the meal is delicious and I absolutely love the shrimp ceviche. Margaritas are also perfection. Try the mango margarita during Happy Hour (it's from 3-7p.m. daily) and you won't be disappointed! I've taken all my friends to try this place out because it really is the best Mexican restaurant in town. Love that they have a gentleman singing on weekends.

We order drinks and they literally took like 5min for them to bring them, we also ordered the adobado burrito and the chicken shredded chimichanga, we were so impressed on how fast our food came, they were delish and very worth it!  I'm so impressed with the service the people and the restaurant overall! I highly recommend this place if you're in need of a good Mexican restaurant!

During our visit I had the chimichanga and an appetizer. A number of people around us ordered the Flaming fajitas which seem to be very popular at the restaurant. I guess it was very popular because it was enough to feed two people off of one entree. When I got my chimichanga the carne asada was overcooked therefore making it dry and less flavorful. I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to this place but, I feel that if I do I should do as everyone else and order the Flaming fajitas. However, on the upside their Margaritas are amazing and they come in a multitude of flavors for you to try. It's Cinco de Mayo coming up I highly suggest you get there early to partake in all of the festivities and nice food that they have to offer.",

As soon as we sat down the chips hit the table along with a bean dip and fresh roasted peppers and onions. Right off the bat the service was excellent and we never had less than 3 waiters hovering around for our every request. We all settled in with drinks before ordering our dinners. I went with the Guadalajara special, I got a large piece of Carne Asada topped with scallops and shrimp covered in a delicious brown sauce of some sort.My Carne Asada was a bit overcooked for my taste, but the seafood and that sauce were simply amazing. Everybody got different things including my niece who went with an order of the Taquitos. Her Taquitos were huge enough that they made a meal  for herself and her girlfriend. By the end of our meal the wait staff brought over a nice dessert with a huge Sombrero for my niece as they sang Happy Birthday. Overall everybody loved their food and Juan's really made my niece's Birthday dinner super special.",

The food here is wonderful and a treat to behold. The service is top notch, and your food arrives very quickly. The restaurant is located in what I guess would be southwest Las Vegas and is nice, but clean and appealing. Otherwise what can you say about the food is wonderful I've pretty much only had the fajitas when I've been there, but hey why not that's what their famous for. Parking can be a little tight as it's in a shopping center with a lot of other stores, and I can imagine this place gets quite crowded on the weekends. All in all, you won't be disappointed with The Flaming Fajita it is simply delicious all the way around.",

I was next-door getting my car fixed and noticed this place across the street it's always been one of those places where you drive by but never stopped and eat at. It was my best friends birthday so I suggested this place being that we both love Mexican food. Upon arrival we were greeted by 2 really friendly hostesses. I asked if they had happy hour and they said yes from 3 to 7 and it's not only in the bar area like most restaurants its everywhere you sit which is a plus. They have a bar as well as a patio outside. The restaurant had a very authentic Mexican feel, I loved the ambience. I was really surprised with their happy hour menu there were so many choices! The margaritas were amazing and only four dollars for a 12 ounce or five dollars for a 16 ounce you can't beat that! I ordered the pina colada margarita on the rocks and my friend had the blended mango margarita both were amazing and just the right amount of alcohol. I like how they offered complementary chips and three different salsas some restaurants charge extra. I ordered the steak quesadilla and I was so shocked at how big it was two people definitely could have shared it! My friend ordered the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and she was scraping her plate at end it was so good. I informed the waiter that it was my friends birthday and he made sure to bring out a complimentary dessert and they sang for her. Overall I loved the experience at Jauns the service was quick everyone was professional and friendly and very attentive. They have one of the best happy hours I've ever seen I will definitely be back!",

We got there and were so lucky to have gotten a spot at the bar. The bartender Juan greeted us right away. He offered chips and salsa. The other bartender Javier came by and got our drink order. The server assistant was younger and walking around the bar he asked if we needed chips and salsa. All within 10 minutes of sitting down I had three people come and greet me! I was already sold! Great service is hard to find, next we ordered appetizers that were on the happy hour menu (shrimp ceviche, and shrimp cocktail) they came fast and were delicious. They served the cocktail with saltines and the ceviche with tostada. The bean dip and salsa they serve with the chips are really good. They taste like authentic salsa. We were so impressed we wanted to try more food! We ordered the two combo plate with Chile rellenos and an enchilada with chicken and red sauce. It also was served with fideo. The fideo is a light tomato based soup served before the main entree. This one at this location is so good! The food was great and I feel like I'm really picky when it comes to Mexican food. The service, the food, the ambience. They have it all. There is a reason there was a 40 minute wait! I love it I will be returning to try their specialty the Flaming Fajitas!",

Although not gonna lie, you can't beat $3.95 margaritas for happy hour.    I mean seriously, Vegas sell fajitas everywhere and this place was like \"let's put water on the fajitas, light it up, make it flame up, then make it our best seller. and BAM! Thus Juan's Flaming Fajitas was made. Definitely try it. All about the experience.  Their service is PHENOMENAL! It was jam packed busy and someone was always helping us at our table. If the server wasn't there, someone else was attentive to come by our table and ask if we needed anything. They are on top of the way they run things here so don't worry, no matter how busy it gets, they have enough people to attend to you.  Other than that, get the damn flaming fajita. Food was very flavorful, juicy, and what a cool experience to see my fajita go up in a 5 foot flame.   This place gets packed towards the evening with a wait, so I suggest going a little bit before dinner because 1) it's happy hour and 2) it's happy hour",

When I looked through the menu I noticed a vegetarian section and was impressed that they notified vegetarians that their bean dip was not vegetarian and that there was an option of vegetarian bean dip.   I ordered a vegetarian burrito with no cheese, cauliflower, and sauce. The burrito I got was literally just a bunch of vegetables wrapped in a tortilla with no beans inside. There were beans on the plate and another portion of vegetables, including cauliflower.   The vegetables were good, but I was a little disappointed. I was expecting something like a portion of black beans, rice, and some veggies inside the burrito, but that's just not what it turned out to be.   My boyfriend order the California Burrito with chicken and thought it was pretty good, but not amazing. One of our family friends also did not think the food was that great. His grandma seemed satisfied with her shrimp fajitas.   The waiters were very nice though! They put a sombrero on grandma's head and sang her happy birthday, giving her little churros with a cherry and candle. They also brought a \"shot\" (looked more like a glass but it probably was watered down) of tequila out per her request and said, \"ready?\" She said yes and they held it to her mouth and had her chug it, no warning. It was pretty funny.   Grandma is pretty lit.",

The tables always start off with chips, two salsas, and sauteed onions and jalapenos. It's always fun to try the different combinations of each or just pile them all on and enjoy. Their Steak is  always tender, Shrimp are never overcooked, and the Chicken has never been dry. I'll have to get back to you when I try the Pork. The little flambe show is always entertaining and the char on the veggies and proteins from the sizlling hot fajita grill adds a great smoky flavor. It comes with their rice, refried beans and all the sides you would expect so you know you won't be leaving hungry.   I always enjoy their Margaritas whenever I get a chance. They pair so well with the food. I'd have to say my favorites so far have been the Mango, Peach, Pina Colada, Raspberry, and Strawberry. All the fruity combinations have me feeling like I'm drinking candy.  Their Happy Hour menu is no joke. You expect portions to be smaller like other restaurants, but what we got looked like a full order. Juan's Flaming Fajitas has given me more for my money on a happy hour menu than any other place I have been to.   Service has always been friendly and attentive whenever I have visited. I look forward to visiting again. Save a little room for dessert!",

The notorious fajitas are priced under $30 for 2 which for their notoriety and what comes with, is pretty great deal.  Sufficient amount of meat with the onions and peppers roasted and \"flamed.\"  Each person gets their own beans and rice and some smooth guac.  Shredded lettuce is only $1 more and plenty to share. They also have a spicy salsa perfect for the fajita.  The fajita was one of the better, more filling I've had.  Steak was the way to go with the chicken tasting cooked but boring.  The free chips had a few salsas to choose from and even some fresh pepper and onion to accompany.  The Happy Hour is every day until 7pm and offer wine and other drinks for under $5.  Juan's has great food fit for a family or a night out.  I would definitely come back, though try to do off hours as every night there is bound to be a wait.",

They started us off with chips, beans and salsa. Their green salsa is really good.  And they give you a plate of sautaide jalapenos and onions. We ordered a lovelady to drink.  We ordered the chicken fingers and fries for my daughter. My boyfriend asked the server if they had carnitas as an option for a chimichanga ( it's not an option on the menu) and she said yes, so he ordered that with rice and beans. I ordered chicken mulitas. They start you off with video soup.   The beer was good. Served in an iced glass. The kids tenders and fries were great. My mulitas were really good, but they're hard to eat. It gets a bit messy. My boyfriend took a couple bites but didn't like his chimichanga. The carnitas weren't what he expected. They were a bit dry and weren't the shredded soft kind hes used to so he didnt eat it. He let the server know and sent it back. She asked if she could get him something else but he declined. When we got our check we were still being charged for the chimichanga even tho he sent it back. He talked to the manager Mimi. Her answer was, \" you should have asked for the shredded carnitas.\" She made it clear that she believed she was right and the customer was wrong. She came to the table and offered 50% off the chimichanga meal. I asked her why if they had two types of carnitas it's not on the menu ot wasnt mentuoned by the server. She was very quick to say that other restaurants do it different ,but they have two types. Again i asked, if you have two types why wasn't  it mentioned. She said she thought 50% was fair because we also had chips and soup. I asked her why she was arguing with me if all i was asking was why if theres two types of carnitas it's not mentioned upon ordering. She mentioned  that she still believed that 50 was fair but that if we wanted off the check she would take it off. She walked away with the check and came back with it off our check. We don't go to restaurants to get a free meal. We go to have an experience and try amazing food. A customers feed back should be most important to a restaurand and it's managers. We didn't apreciate Mimis attitude. I loved everything else about the restaurant but vecause her unappreciative and rude attitude, we will not be back. She ruined our experience.",

The food is awesome and consistent. The fajitas really as flaming and amazing! Taquitos are good tacos are yummy everything has been great! I don't live in the Southwest at all but go that way just for Juan's! Never had any cocktails there but there's a full service bar which is awesome if we ever go without the kiddos. The only thing I really dislike is their lack of waiting area...you're constantly in someone's way when waiting and often end up standing outside. If they could figure out how to expand that area this place would be perfect!",

The hostess informed us we were in time for Happy Hour, so we scanned the menu to see if anything caught our eye. Man oh man is their HH menu extensive!? I was blown away!? We settled on a beer and strawberry margarita. Beer is standard, good as always; as for the margarita, that could be deadly and dangerous. It is so perfectly blended that you cannot taste the tequila. As for munchies, we were given an endless supply of chips, salsa, and refried beans. Yum.  As for our entrees, they were ridiculously good. We both live in San Diego, so our standard for Mexican food is relatively high, but I would come here in a heartbeat, if in the area again. We ordered a beef chimichanga and a chicken enchilada. Both were delicious and flavorful, especially the chicken. Neither were dry either. The portion was just right too. Not something you would share with someone else; if you took any home, it would be a VERY small amount.  The service was excellent, above average I would say. The food was spot-on. I hope this place makes it. It's a hidden gem if you are looking for somewhere off the strip to relax and enjoy.",

We chose Juan's based on the great  reviews.    Started in the cantina since the wait on this Friday evening was about 20 minutes.  The strawberry Coronarita's were a hit with the group.  Dos XX and Corona Light on tap along with a number of other options.  Chips were good and we couldn't stop eating the salsa and bean dip.  They're famous for the Flaming Fajitas so the mixed chicken and beef were the choice.  In a word, excellent.  Big portions, all the options included (sour cream, pico, guac) along with rice and beans or veggies.  Not only was the food great but service was very attentive including refills on everything from drinks to chips and sides.  We rounded it out with the sopapillas and consensus was, this will be a repeat too.   Will be back soon and often!  Glad we found Juan's!",

It can get pretty busy though so I'd recommend making a reservation if you're looking to go in the evening time, or try to catch a seat at the bar! It's a great family place but also perfect for a date night!!  My husband loves the chicken enchiladas with red sauce but my favorite is the Mulitas!!!! Although I prefer the lunch portion because it's a HUGE serving and I can rarely even finish one!! No worries, you can always take the leftovers to enjoy later at home!!!  Really no place compares in my opinion to Juans, it's just excellent all the way across the board!! Soo happy to finally have a great Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood!! Good job Juan!!! :)",

So as we're driving into the parking lot of the Flaming Fajitas I quickly pulled out the Yelp app and checked some of the reviews. Norm K. recommended the flaming fajita so I decided then and there that that's what I'm getting.   Immediately upon sitting down, a waitstaff came over to our table and laid down a plate of grilled onions and jalapenos, chips and salsa. I absolutely loved the grilled jalapenos and the bean dip that came with the chips - so much that I asked for extra servings of jalapenos!   The flaming fajita serves two people. We shared that and had plenty of leftovers. Normally I find that beef served at Mexican restaurants are always on the tough side. But at Juan's Flaming Fajitas, the beef was very tender and flavorful.   Over all it was a great experience! I will sure to come back to try out the flan, more grilled jalapenos and more flaming fajitas!",

The day was rainy and cool; the lighting was dim and coozy; the sizzling sounds and heat from nearby fajita platters kept us warm.  They have a three dollar margarita that will keep you entertained while consuming delicious salsa, bean dip and chips.  The salsa is fantastic.  The smoky flavor reminded me of a favorite haunt back in my home town.  The GF and I split a delicious chicken fajita quesadilla.  Looking forward to trying a flaming plater of meat and vegetables in the future.  Alas, a majority of lunch consisted of $3 dollar margaritas.  The service was at times a little slow, but the server would make up for it with his friendly demeanor.  As the rain continued to fall and eventually start flooding nearby Tropicana.  With check having been paid, I made a run at the cantina.  The bartender was friendly and served up a mean margarita that had a lot more soul and booze than the tres buck version.",

Instead of being just another boring Mexican joint, Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina does a lot of little things to set themselves apart from the rest.  The chips came with two kinds of salsa, beans and grilled onions and chilies. They gave everyone a very good cup of soup prior to the meal. The flaming Fajitas were a nice touch and the food was great.  Highly recommend this place and will be a regular spot on our next trip.",

Between us we have chips/salsa/bean dip, soups, chile Colorado, fajitas (chicken and steak), and some really yummy looking tacos.  I tried both, the corn and flour tortillas with the meal and they were also a good compliment. I didn't drink as I went for lunch so unfortunately I wasn't able to rate the margaritas.

This last visit we were in the mood for some authentic Mexican breakfast, so my wife ordered the huevos rancheros and I ordered the huevos con chorizo y papas plate. These items are under the Brunch section of the menu and a drink is included from soft drinks to a draft beer, mimosa, or a margarita.  Both of our plates were fantastic and the beers went down nicely as well!! The portions are generous and you also get chips with salsa and beans to get everything started.   During football season, Juan's also has all day football specials that include $3.50 pints of their Mexican beers on tap and an assortment of appetizers and taco plates. On top of that, they have an awesome Happy Hour from 3-7p everyday that also has similar specials.   I haven't tried the actual flaming fajitas yet, but I plan on doing so on one of my next visits. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy some killer Mexican food in a fun and relaxing atmosphere!!",

    "text": "I am extremely disappointed in my experience this evening at Juan's. My husband have enjoyed coming here regularly since moving to Las Vegas. Their Queso Dip is one of the reasons we like it so much. Tonight, we were having friends over and decided to order their queso to-go to bring home and share. Upon arriving, the to-go waitress brought out a very small cup in a brown bag with nothing else. When I asked why there were no chips, I was told \"chips and salsa are only complimentary for dine in guests\". I reiterated that I ordered the Queso \"DIP\" and was expecting chips to DIP in the dip. She again said that \"chips and salsa are only complimentary for dine-in guests\" but she would be happy to ADD chips and salsa to my order. Let me be very clear, this was not a small side of queso that we ordered, it was an appetizer listed under appetizers on their menu. If the queso is not SERVED WITH chips it should not be listed as an appetizer but as a side instead! The to-go server did not see the problem with an appetizer of queso with no chips and ensured me I could ADD salsa and chips. I had no interest in adding additional food to an order I expected to be complete with chips. She did not offer to bring only chips, only that I could add them with salsa.   In the past, the same to-go/host has greeted us. She's not friendly. The service staff is usually much more friendly. But, we go for their food. After this experience and the disappointing fact that because I'm not DINING in this evening I will not be given chips with the queso \"DIP\" appetizer I ordered to go, we will not be returning to this restaurant. Juan's is not the closest Mexican Food Restaurant to our house, but we've enjoyed the food. After this experience with their host / to-go person, we will find a different restaurant to frequent.   I want to give zero stars for this evening alone, but I don't think it's fair to the kitchen staff to not at least be recognized for the food we've enjoyed in the past.",

They have great customer service here.  The waitstaff and hostesses do an amazing job!  Chips, bean dip, salsa and sauteed toppings are brought out with seconds of sitting down.   Fabulous!  The sauteed toppings include onions, jalapenos and red hot peppers.   Yummy!    With the dinner entrees, their soup is brought out for the table.   It's delicious!  Great flavor!  Honestly I was almost full after the chips and soup! It seemed as if it were 2 seconds after I finished my soup were our entrees delivered.   On our first visit, we had to order the flaming fajitas of course!   What a show!!    The mound of meat and veggies on this are sure to fill anyone's appetite.   They were absolutely delicious and would highly recommend them!   On my second visit I wanted to try the shrimp tacos.  Again, fabulous flavor and filled with a lot of shrimp!  On both occasions I ordered the grilled vegetables instead of the rice and beans.  It's a great side item that compliments any meal.    Our drinks never went empty and our stomachs were filled to the brim!  A fabulous restaurant!  Thanks Juan's!",

All of that happened even before we can open the menu! It's a bunch of different servers working together. I think that's one of the things that made this place stand out for me. We have one server who took our orders but there were a bunch of other people working around making sure our drinks were filled, our dips were not running low, the used plates were out of the way, everything they were on top of it!  The food was excellent too. I got shrimp fajita that came with a side of rice, guacamole and beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I was excited to see them light it on fire! It was surely entertaining! If you order the combo on a Tuesday night, instead of paying $12, you only pay $10. The portions were huge and the sauces they provided were abundant. For two people, it was definitely a feast. We made room for desserts and ordered churros. It was sooooo good. Maybe because I have been craving them but seriously, with a little bit of whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, those churros were melt in my mouth good.   Also, I love it when the whole restaurant sings when it is somebody's birthday. It makes the ambiance more friendly and festive. I was definitely a good change from my boring Tuesday nights.",

Of course, order the fajitas...I've had the vegetable fajitas, shrimp fajitas, and chicken fajitas. The shrimp fajitas were definitely the best. They're cooked perfectly and the caramelized onions on the skillet are amazing. The wait time can get pretty long if you go around the 5PM hour on a friday or weekends...but I would say it's work the wait.",

Omar was on target and gave us the best service we had in a long time. Thank you for a great meal. Steak fajitas were awesome, tacos delicious.   We will be back.",

I love how they light them on fire before they put them on your table. Great presentation! And I also like how the fajitas are in a round raised bowl instead of flat on the table with those long handles so you're not constantly having to be careful to not burn yourself! The chips and salsa are excellent and bean dip is super good! The service was outstanding. Several workers checked on us throughout our meal and were very friendly. I can't wait to go back. The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because the place needs more decor! I like going to Mexican restaurants that are all decorated inside like a fiesta! There was nothing fun about the inside of this place. Will definitely go back",

I would recommend to anyone that enjoys excellent Mexican food. This is also a great place to bring friends/family from out of town. Delicious!!!",

I always order the grilled fish tacos. The fish is so tender and moist.

The chicken had great seasoning and the right amount of char and even had a touch of flare with a fire bath before serving.  So good!   Total bill for two during lunch was $24.",

There has only been about 2-3 times, we only had to wait 10 minutes.  Do expect to smell like fajitas afterwards, even if you don't order the fajitas.  Other people orders it, you will smell.  I wouldn't suggest to eat here is you have some event to tend afterwards.    Fajitas are the best here.  We tried so far the shrimp and steak.  I think I like the shrimp better.  I tend to order the Chicken Quesadilla, Mexican Combinations (tamales, enchilada, tacos, and/or burritos).  Portions are huge, fresh and tasty.    Definitely try to eat here as often as my husband allows it.  LOL, he doesn't like the way we smell afterwards.  Will have to shower once we get home every time.",

The parking lot is way too small for this restaurant AND an In N Out (just saying).   Once I walked in the I was greeted by the hostess and found my friends immediately. We ordered margaritas off the happy hour menu. They make a mean margarita! Then we had the fundito cheese to start along with warm tortilla chips and 2 types of homemade fresh salsa. The fundito cheese is basically a flavorful cheese melted on a hot ass grilled plate. It was DELICIOUS!  Once we placed our entrees, we were brought out a small cup of hot fiedo soup. It was the best fiedo soup I've ever had.   We HAD to order fajitas at a Flamming fajita's restaurant! So I see the fajitas coming out way. Once they came to the table the waiter ignites the fajitas on FIRE! It smelled so good. My friend ordered the steak fajitas. The meat was so tender and had such an amazing seasoning on it. I recommend the steak or beef opinion. Then to finish off the night we ordered the fried ice cream.  Ambience: Fun but a little loud and smoky a bit during to the fajitas on fire.   Quality: 10 out of 10. Great flavor and so tender!  Price: Very well priced. Between the 3 of us each of us paid $23 bucks  Service: The best. Very attentive without being too attentive.   Once we left the waiting area was full and people were actually waiting outside! So their busiest time is between 5-6pm.   Final thoughts: I have to bring everyone I know here it's THAT good!",

There was no seating at bar either, so we had to stand, but bar tenders were quick and friendly. They have happy hour EVERYDAY! The margaritas were like $5 and cheap beers. The margaritas were not watered down. I had the Pina Colada flavor, and it had sweet pieces of coconut and pineapple.  I also had a spicy watermelon that was not on happy hour menu, but only $9 nice flavors and strong.  Our waiter was really nice and took our orders pretty quick. Then we had the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. The bean dip is sooo good, but no free refills.  2 other staff members came by to check on us throughout our meal and even apologized to us for the long wait. Our food was delish and tasted homemade. Beans were creamy and full of garlic flavor. My fave was the chile relleno. It was stuffed with cheese and had a nice crispy coating even with the delish red sauce on top. I will def be back especially for the delish and cheap margaritas! Hopefully not much of a wait on the next visit.",

Great mix of people in the restaurant from blue collar to corporate executives and Senior citizens.

The service has always been excellent from the hostess to the waiters and bus boys all the way down to the owner (who has been there to greet us multiple times during our visits).   The appetizers are very tasty with good fideo, grilled onion and jalapenos, and salsa and beans for the chips. The table side guacamole is also good a good choice. The only detractor is the chips. I thought that they used to make their own tortilla chips but the last few times they were underwhelming and bland. I don't know where they got them but I would much rather have True tortilla chips.   The meals taste great and the portions are plenty big enough (2 piece combo fills me up and you can add another item still). I've enjoyed the fish tacos and carne asada burrito (red sauce) among other things. The taco salad with grilled vegetables is another highlight for me. On birthdays they will humiliate your friend by throwing a sombrero on and singing their version of happy birthday so that's an entertaining plus ( they get a super sweet churro dessert for being a sport).   Overall I'm a fan of Juan's Flaming Fajitas and will be back again.",

A lady (not our server) asked us if we were done while we were taking a break from munching on our food.  She then proceeded to take our roasted jalapenos not asking if we did not want it (and we did).  While hubby puts away our food in the to-go box, this same lady puts her whole arm in front of hubby as if he was the one in the way of her getting everything off our table.  She comes back to our table and asked if I was done with my plate when here I am, holding a spoon to feed my toddler.  I just didn't understand why she kept taking things away from our table. Why was she rushing us when clearly there were empty tables and no one waiting tone seated.   What bothered me also is that she kept passing by our table looking at our empty water glasses and never bothered to refill it (and this was even before she started rummaging our table).  If you're not going to refill it, then don't look over!  Ugh!    I'm so UPSET!!! I loved going here until this lady! I was so bothered!!!",

We ordered the chicken, shrimp, and steak fajitas. It was all great! However we both felt the shrimp didn't have much seasoning on it and tasted a bit bland. The chicken and steak were seasoned perfectly! We highly recommend either one.",

After coming to this place, my opinion has changed and I'm admitting that this restaurant has changed my view of Mexican cuisine.   Juan's puts out complimentary chips and salsa. The chips or nachos are out of this world. Warm and crispy dipped into a bean dip, mild, or hot salsa made fresh. You can tell each element was made fresh and not reheated packages food.   The complimentary soup was delicious and vibrant.   We ordered the steak and chicken fajitas and the queso dip appetizer. The marinade in the meats were on point. We put queso dip into our fajitas and it was an explosion of flavor that I've never experienced at a Mexican restaurant. By the time we finished I could barely move. Lots of people I hear end up getting half full just off the nachos and it's hard to resist them because they're so delicious. I have no idea how anyone has room for desert.   We came in around 4pm. My thought process was this place has to be busy during dinner hours so it's best to go early to get seated right away. When we arrived at 4pm, the place was nearly packed. I couldn't believe it. Even really good restaurants I frequent isn't this busy at 4pm.   I do plan on coming back but with more people. It's too much food for just two people even if you order just one entree. Between the  complimentary nachos and soup, half your stomach is full before the entree arrives.   This is by far the best Mexican restaurant experience in my life! You gotta try this place. The food is worth the wait if you can't get seated right away.",

We had queso for our chips that were served with a bunch of sauces. We had a taco salad, Guadalajara seafood special and the steak fajitas.   We will definitely be going back. The food and service was 5 star and this is now a recommendation when on the west side for Mexican food.",

    "text": "My friends and family have been talking about this place for a while and I was excited to come check it out. The food was very good, the service very good, happy hour excellent, and the portions solid for the price.  This place was SLAMMED on Sunday at 4. I imagine it's always this busy. They quoted us a 45 min wait, but it was less than 15. They send text updates and you can check where you are in line at any given moment. That was convenient.   Normally, I'd sample a bunch of items before posting a review. This trip we ordered the namesake: Flaming fajitas. We ordered the fajitas for two with steak and pork. We got margaritas as well.   Margaritas was better than average at a really good price point. $4 during their happy hour. The fajitas give energy to the room as the service gives a table-side flambe just before serving. The tortillas were also solid. The steak was maybe the best fajita steak I've ever had, but the pork was underwhelming. If I went back again I'd just order anything with that steak in it.   Our waiter was busting his behind trying to keep everyone happy. He was a little slow with our check and brought us the wrong tortillas at first. He fixed the tortilla issue though as soon as we asked.   They seemed disorganized and outside of the steak and table-side presentation of the fajitas it was just a run of the mill Mexican spot. I look forward to going again to try more items. Having only had one item, this seems to be one of the better Mexican places on the west side of town.",

As you sit, your table will get chips salsa/bean dip/sauteed onions and pepper, but don't get too full on this. Leave some room for your main entrees. Portions are big and it never fails that I need a to-go box for the left overs. The table side guacamole and ceviche are bomb as well. I like the fact that the servers check up on you often. There can be a bit of a wait especially if you come for dinner time (30-40mins). The parking lot gets full also, since it is right next to In N Out. Food is delish, I just hate that you smell like fajitas afterwards hahaha.",

I wanted to like this place but with our orders being wrong twice, the food being flavorless and our waiter having attitude and not paying attention this family will find another place to go....ATTENTION MANAGEMENT: if your personnel make the mistakes and fail in there day to day Conduct have them own it, learn from it and move on from it so they don't repeat it. Don't see how all these glowing reviews make it !?!",

I'm handed a menu and asked for my drink order. Always with a kind smile and great attitude. As I place my order to go, chips, 2 salsas and beans, onions and jalapenos are places in front of me. I've been here twice now and my orders have been: chicken al mojo de ajo and the chicken con nopales. Both come with sopa de fideo (best I've had yet) and rice and beans. The food is mouth watering delicious! This place is all in all 5 STARS!! The service from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave AMAZING! The food is the best in town!

I informed our waiter that my wife can't do cilantro (I happen to like it but it bugs me when chefs toss it on everything but oatmeal (Bobby Flay do you hear me? So he made sure that there was no cilantro (except some on the side for me). He even had the chef slice up some nice avocado instead of giving us guacamole which had cilantro. Super margaritas. Chip, salsa you expect, but the EXCELLENT warm bean dip was a delicious surprise if I lived near here I would come in for margaritas and chips and the bean dip. We had fajitas for two, chicken and pork. SO MUCH FOOD! And skillfully prepared. Very fresh and al dente veg. Cup of soup included was delish as well. Can't tell you about dessert, we never made it through HALF of our fajitas!!",

A friends of mine said he heard it was good so my wife and I tried it after reading all the rave reviews online. Well we now have a new favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. What can I add to what's already been written? The service is friendly, attentive and overall outstanding. The fajitas are very generous (the two of us could have split the chicken fajitas for one) and my wife enjoyed the enchilada and taco combination plate which she ordered with the fresh vegetables. That's a really nice touch that you don't see often as an alternative to rice and beans (they have refried and black beans). As everyone has said the chips and salsa/bean dip that arrive moments after you are seated are excellent. We heeded everyone's advice and held back so as not to spoil our dinner. We went on a Monday at 6:00pm and did not have to wait for a table. The place was busy and as people left they were replaced by an endless stream of customers. They do have outdoor dining but it was 109 degrees outside, even shade with misters (both of which they have) wouldn't be enough to make it comfortable for me (admittedly an wimpy AC devotee). We really enjoyed Juan's a lot.",

Right with us she was because we were immediately seated into a large booth that accomodated these minions perfectly. Booths were high enough so when the 2 year old decides to abruptly stand on his seat he isn't looking over into anyone's way or making eye contact with the people.behind us.  As soon as we were seated, it seemed like we were instantly served freshly fried house chips, salsas, and their bean dip. They also brought a small.plate of grilled jalapenos and onions. In which to my surprise the jalapenos were sweet and not spicy. I'm not accustomed to the non-spicy jalapenos. I thought it was a nice touch as that isn't something we typically see when eating at a Mexican restaurant as a house offering. She then brought out a couple cup size bowls of their fideo soup. Which was awesome because we I ended up feeding it to my 10month old...twas a good tranquilizer. Lol.  They serve their happy hour menu daily from 3-7pm. We came in close to 4 and the place was just filling up. It's a nice restaurant that offers a 21 year and over section, and even patio seating.   I quickly found the house margarita on their happy hour menu. You can choose between a 12 of a 16oz for $4.95. I think the 12oz is for a dollar less. I didn't pay attention because I was looking for the largest size I could get at a deal.   Honestly, I wasn't expecting their house margarita at a happy hour menu price to be potent. I kinda don't expect that anywhere. I will say that their house margarita was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it to taste better than alot of margaritas ive tried. I can't imagine what their top shelf margaritas taste like! I would have to return without the kids to find out. 2 16oz glasses of their margarita later, and I literally could of drank 4 more to probably catch a thorough buzz. It did, however, fulfill my taste buds for that margarita crave. Since I had the kids, coming from a quick hike, and bound for the mother-in-law's house...I suppose it was a good thing the drink wasn't doused in tequila or else I'd be heading to the in laws drunk. Not a good look. Lol.  Anyway, with the chips and salsas...they were super quick to refill our chips and dips. I love how they offer a nonspicy salsa for the kids. They certainly weren't afraid to serve those up. I even told my husband if they keep refilling our chips, bean dip, and salsa...I don't even think we'll order actual food.   Which is kinda what happened. My kids just wanted taquitos, which to my excitement was on the happy hour menu. Lol. So I ordered one beef and one chicken in which each plate comes with 4 taquitos cut into halves. So in total...you have 8 pcs to pick at. I had to try them, and thought they were pretty good. There was certainly flavor in the meat.  The husband and I decided to share....we'll what else, a Flaming fajita. You have the option of ordering the Flaming fajita for one or two. Because I wasn't that hungry anymore after all the chips and salsas I had been chunking down...we opted for the one and decided to share that.   Our orders did not take too long to come out. Perhaps I didn't notice because the chips and my margarita was distracting me from keeping time. When they bring out your fajitas....they literally flame it up infront of you. Our waiter, Hernan, fantastic by the way! He drizzled some kind of oil and lit that sucker on fire. And voila, Flaming fajita right before your eyes.  Overall, it's pretty standard. The service was wonderful and homely at the same time. Our waiter counted our 4 boys, plugged in the 5th child girl spill...the lady who kept cleaning our table off always took the time to stop and play with our 10month old the way an aunt would. When our 10month old would fuss she'd come by with crackers...so that was real thoughtful.   We certainly had a great experience. The meats in the taquitos and the fajitas (husband chose pork, btw) were definitely moist and not bland at all. The service completely made it a 4 star experience. We would certainly come back.  Definitely recommend if you are in the vicinity. Kid and stroller friendly! Although, I'd say just leave the stroller in the car just so it isn't in the way, unless, they can seat you in booths that have lots of aisle space. Also, working buckles on their highchairs! Thank you for that!  P.S. Always check-in each visit as you get 15 percent off your bill. Shibby!",

I would have wanted to walk-out and cancel our orders but my wife was still busy talking to somebody over the phone. So I waited, waited and waited. And then I noticed that the 2 customers on the other booth who arrived 5 mins late than us received their orders already and then the 2 other tables received theirs as well..Then finally, came ours. I didn't complain about the unreasonable delay but the servers noticed that I was not happy. A server approached us and apologized for the delay and few minutes thereafter, they gave us a complimentary dessert.  I hope this won't happen to future customers. Good food but too much delay in the preparation. 20 mins of waiting is acceptable, 30 mins is already considered delayed but 46 mins of waiting is totally unacceptable. It's our first time to dine out here but it's not worth it.   Thanks for the free dessert though!",

The grilled steak & chicken were good with the right seasoning. I liked the brief fire show when they brought the fajitas to our table. It was surprisingly a huge fire, but it only lasted about 2 minutes. They provided nice, thin chips with many condiments, such as two super spicy salsas (too much for me), pureed beans, grilled jalapenos & onions. My only complaint was about the tortillas. They steamed them too much that they were stuck together and on the doughy side rather than being more like bread. We went on a Saturday, and the place was really packed. It took about 30 minutes for us to get a seat.",

My wife had the chicken floutas and she loved it. My grandma had the cheese enchilada and tamale combo plate and everything was fresh as can be. we noticed a lot of people ordered the flaming fajitas. My friend ordered the steak  fajitas for one and he said it ranked up there with some of the best he ever had.I can't stress how fresh the food was we were all very impressed and will definitely be coming back again soon!",

From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out, the experience was phenomenal. Arguably the best food/service we've ever had. The host was nice when we walked in, the waiter and multiple other waiters/bus boys were attentive and nice the whole time we were there and ALL the food we ordered was great! Their chips, salsa, refried beans and grilled onions with peppers and soup (all are complimentary) were excellent. We had some shrimp ceviche to start and shrimp fajitas for dinner. It was all fantastic. Highly recommend this joint. Food was a 10, service was a 10. No cons to even mention.",

Our waiter came back to see if we needed anything and even brought more then 1 bean dip and salsa for the table without us asking. Most of the time you get a tiny cup to share with a group of people but these were decent sized salsa and bean dips and requesting more was no charge. I didn't care for the salsa and it was thin. The bean dip was good and liked by our table. A cup of Fideo soup was included with the meal and it was really good. For dinner I had a 2 item combo. Chili Relleno, Cheese Enchilada and of course rice and beans. The beans were good because it was probably the same bean dip we were eating previously. The rice was dry and nasty. My plate was swimming in red sauce and some of it was soggy. The relleno wasn't great but I did enjoy the enchilada, soggy and all. This plate could have had less sauce so you could get more flavor from what was under it. My wife and a friend had fajitas and I ended up eating a couple. The meat was tough and chewy and the vegetables weren't even cooked. My wife is also in love with avocados and was not pleased with their guacamole at all. Maybe we came on an off night because this appears to be a popular place and the restaurant had plenty of customers in it. I just can't say I ate anything that I would come back for.",

From the fresh chips and 3 types of salsa on the table as we were seated to the perfectly crispy churros brought with the check, every detail was on point. Dinner started with a cup of soup for everyone at the table. It was a noodle soup in a chicken tomato broth, simple but delicious. I ordered the New Mexico enchiladas. They were packed with well seasoned chicken and covered with a rich red sauce (extra spicy as I had asked for) and topped with plenty of melty cheese. The others at the table (also Southern Californians) ordered different dishes which they all loved as well. Service was great despite the restaurant being packed (8:30pm on Saturday night) and our waiter Omar was friendly and provided great recommendations. Happy to have found my new home for Mexican food in Vegas!",

    "text": "My husband and I made our first trip from the far Northwest side of town to Juan's Flaming Fajitas last week. There are a few Mexican restaurants in our neck of the woods, and the ones we have tried have not impressed us. I could not have been more pleased with the service or the food at Juan's! I had the chicken fajitas and my husband had cheese enchiladas. I'm allergic to green peppers, so I asked that they be left off my dish. The waiter was very accommodating and said that was easy to do. When my fajitas arrived, they had green peppers. The food was delivered by someone other than our waiter. I'm so used to this happening, I proceeded to remove the green peppers and started my meal. My waiter came over almost immediately and asked how things were. I said other than the green peppers, everything seems great. He offered his apologies, and left the table. Within a minute, he returned with fajitas minus green peppers, saying apparently the young man who delivered the food had not noticed and picked up the wrong order. I offered to give him back the fajitas with the peppers and he declined. He said I deserved to have the order I requested and left me with both plates. Well, I had already started the ones with the removed peppers so I proceeded to eat that dish and he very kindly packed up the second dish for what was an exceptional dinner later that night. My husband did not love his enchiladas but my husband rarely loves his enchiladas, yet he continues to try them in every new restaurant. We had one restaurant in town that has closed after 40 years in business and that was his spot. I'm not really sure what he's looking for, but he is super finicky so they may be fine for everyone else. Overall, I give this restaurant five stars for food, service, and prices. You can't forget prices! They are extremely reasonable here and I'm sure we will be back soon... I just won't let my husband order cheese enchiladas",

The pork is incredible and the sauce it's cooked in is sweet and jalapeno spicy. The corn tortillas actually smell like corn when you open up the holder and are super fresh and thick.

My husband and I stumbled upon Juan's when we were going to in-n-out (who they share a parking lot with) and knew we had to try it - we are so glad we did. We were quickly welcomed by the host, who I believe is the owner, seated quickly, and had the best first experience - our server explained the menu, made suggestions, and was just a pleasure to be around. Every single one of our experiences since then have been just as awesome, or better. The service is always spectacular, fast, and everyone working always acts like a team. The last time we came on a weekend, they had a full mariachi band and chorus of singers - the atmosphere here is warm and comfortable, but also lively and fun... It's like they're welcoming you into their home. That's how great this place is.  Now the food - yes, the tacos are amazing. The chips and salsas (they have several- just ask!) are fresh and tasty - but they live by their name. The fajitas are where it's at!!! They have a great deal for fajitas for 2 - we always get chicken, and they are truly the best fajitas we have ever had. It's a huge portion and we always have leftovers. Plus we love when they come out, pour the vodka over the grill, and light the flames - what a presentation :)   We're completely in love with this place and it's hands down our favorite mexican place in Vegas. Highly, highly, highly recommend!",

For starters, Juan's replaces the mundane chips and salsa from every other restaurant with a medium salsa roja, salsa verde, and bean dip. Both salsas had an appetizing kick, but the verde was my personal favorite.   As I wandered in around 12:30, I found their lunch specials for $9.99 chicken fajitas. Served with the typical accoutrement of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo, the fajitas were incredible! And as the name implies, they are indeed \"flaming\" when they finish it off at your table flambe style!   Overall, this place now tops my list of Mexican eateries in the area, and located within just a few minutes of the 215, I will DEFINITELY be back again soon!",

    "text": "So I would like to start off by saying I have been coming here (quite often) for the last 2 years but have never gotten around to writing a review but it is long overdue!!! I usually go with my boyfriend and we always have a good time and enjoy ourselves, but we have started to request Omar because he is amazing!  I have never felt like \"VIP\" at a local restaurant but as soon as we sit at his table he treats us like we are family friends.   The feeling is amazing & (along with the delicious food) it keeps us coming back.    We recommend the table side guacamole (extra spicy) or shrimp ceviche for apps.  They also serve sauteed peppers and onions with their complimentary chips and salsa.  For main course the list goes on and on!  You can never go wrong with the fajitas of course, chicken and shrimp combo is our go to.  The Guadalajara special is a MUST! We get this more often than the fajitas.... it's perfect to share after a basket of chips, salsa, & guac!  The parrillada, carne asada a la tampiquena, marisco adobados, and the parrillada de marisco are all delicious choices!! This place has awesome entrees that are \"outside of the box\" for a normal Mexican restaurant. Do yourself a favor and skip the traditional tacos and quesadilla and get one of these amazing entrees!",

The chips and salsa was awesome and the place smelled really good.  We all ordered fajitas. My son and his fiance got the Shrimp for 2, I got the steak and her mom got the chicken. The presentation was awesome how they come out and set it on fire right in front of you. Then he placed them on our table and right away my first comment was \"wow that's a lot of onions\"  It was basically lots of Onions, meat and a little bit of bell peppers. No flavor but onions. I whispered to my son, \"can you taste the fajita flavor? Cause I just taste onions\" He said he must have been really hungry the first time he came because it's not that good today.   The Margaritas were awesome and so was our server.  I'll probably come back and try something else, just not the fajitas.",

Spanish guitar helps with the digestion!  5.  The Food is excellent.  The steak fajita is the best I have ever had with juicy and tender steak.  I also enjoy the pageantry and presentation that comes with ordering these flaming fajitas.  6.  FRIED ICE CREAM.  I have always been a fan of the dangerous idea of dropping scoops of ice cream into boiling oil!   7.  The overall price is very affordable especially if you use the Yelp Discount!",

We actually decided to eat dinner earlier and at 5 there was a bunch of families already there eating and watching football.   Service was really attentive from the start. We decided to order the mixed fajita (chicken and beef). We both got Fideo soup and it was pretty tasty. The flaming fajitas part was entertaining but I think what matters is the food. The chicken and beef were tasty and moist and I even ended up eating onions with it and I don't like onions.  I asked for double rice instead of the rice and beans on the side and they gave it to me like I asked! The tortilla was a thicker type kind of like the type you get at Taco Bell, but other than the tortilla everything was delicious. We actually ended up ordering the churros for dessert too which was good.   Overall, this place is good if you want fajitas. I definitely want to try some of the other items on the menu too.",

I was skeptical, as I have yet to find a place that is as close to those in Northern California, come close but there is something missing.  Juan's in my opinion is 90% closer and that is a good thing. The restaurant is located off Tropicana and Fort Apache in the Southwest side of the town that we visited early one afternoon and happened to hit Margarita Wednesday, the ambiance is typical of most Mexican Restaurants, the decor, multiple televisions etc.  We arrived right before the rush and glad we did...by the time we left the place had people waiting. The menu is very extensive and offer many combinations, my wife and I selected the Beef Fajitas for two and were complimented with great Fideo Soup, chips with salsas etc.  The delivery and presentation of the Fajitas was outstanding, Overall the food was delicious, as expected and to my surprise I found out that they have posole all the time.....I am hooked.....since our first visit...we've been there 4 times in 3 weeks...it is now one of our go to places.....plus the service staff was awesome...",

We were seated fairly close to the reservation time.  The place was packed on a Wednesday evening.    We tried their famous margaritas.  I thought the peach margarita was quite good.  It was definitely strong though not too \"peachy\" in flavor.  I sampled a mango flavor which I think was better.    Unlimited chips and salsa were provided along with a complimentary soup.  The chips and salsa were quite good.  The salsa was fresh and zesty.  The soup was OK; it tasted more like an instant soup powder with water added.    Then we had the chicken and steak fajita combo for two with rice and vegetables.  This was a large though not apparently flaming platter of assorted meats and vegetables.  The meats were tender and flavorful, and this was of course served with tortillas which were excellent and tasted homemade.  A large portion but perfect for two.  We saw some interesting desserts on the menu but decided to wait on these for next time.    Our server might have been overwhelmed by the large party because he was frankly kind of curt and not terribly friendly.    The food would definitely bring us back to try again, though!",

Our waiter was Valentin. He was wonderful. We got the flaming fajitas for two. There must have been enough food for four people. We had chips with salsa, beans, onions and peppers. Them came soup for each of us. At this point, I'm already thinking that this is a lot of food and I'm not sure how much I can eat. Well...to my surprise, here comes the main attraction where he set the fajitas ablaze. It definitely caught our attention. Mind you, this was our first time coming here. We came here because it was suggested as a good place to eat although the suggester has never been here. If you live locally and haven't been here, then shame on you. If you're here traveling or on vacation, then make sure to stop by. The staff are all friendly and will take care of you.",

The guacamole was fresh and authentic, containing large chunks of avocado. A great start to an anticipated good meal.   Of course going to a Mexican restaurant, you need a beer, and the Do's Equis Lager hit the spot.   We tried a carne asada chimichanga and the Guadalajara Special. Both dishes were huge and tasted great and authentic. We finished with an order of churros, which was a great ending to an enjoyable meal.    Our server, Yajaira, was super nice, friendly and took the time to tell us about the ingredients in some of the dishes we were not familiar with. Great service. Looking forward to our next visit, but be sure to go hungry. The portions are huge.",

The best part was the endless fresh chips and three different types of salsa's; red salsa(hot, but the best), green salsa and a sexy bean dip which we all loved. All the dishes were excellent. I had the New Mexico Chicken Enchiladas, very tasty. I did try one of the beef taquitos, which I was originally going to order, so good! We all enjoyed our food and will definitely go back for seconds!  Check in on Yelp and get $5 off your $50 bill. Love the check in Perks!  Highly recommend.",

I saw there was over 1000 reviews had to try it for myself. Be ready for a wait during dinner. Hostesses were friendly with the crowd waiting and kept us up to date on time. When we were seated they brought us chips and 3 dips- the pinto beans we had to get refilled, it was that good! I got a margarita, give that a 3 out 5 for taste. My husband and I did the 2 meat combo fajitas. The shrimp and steak came out flaming- literally! Great 5 second show. Steak was tender but could use some salt. Shrimp was good size. Dinner was delicious definitely want to go back and try other things on the menu. Ambience- fun bar with lots of tvs, there's outdoor by the fire pit and a dining room area. Will definitely come back I had attentive and suservers!   Came back on a Tuesday found out more good menu specials. $10.95 Tuesday specials on the combination and happy hour is till 7:",

    "text": "The wife and I stopped by on a Thursday afternoon between 2-3 p.m. We found this place by looking for Las Vegas restaurants on the internet and this place popped up in the results. This is the best Mexican food in town. Service is always excellent.   The food was very fresh and the Margaritas were good as well. My wife and daughter split the fajitas and I got a combo plate. Fresh chips and salsa, amazing margaritas with so many flavours, fajita was perfect. We had both the steak and the chicken and were equally as good.   I'm picky about my Mexican. This place gets 5 stars being authentic and very good. For the price totally worth it.  Awesome food. Huge portions. Great price. Everything we ate was tasty and homemade. Open one up on the East Coast plz. I will definitely be back every time I come visit Las Vegas!",

    "text": "We were planning to go to a different mexican restaurant for hubby's b-day until we saw the bad news on Dirty Dining (talk about disappointing, and gross). Enter seeing the busy parking lot, one day, when hubby saw it during Happy Hour. He asked me to check it out on Yelp (great reviews, lots of positive attention, the menu looked appealing). And we had renewed faith into eating out again, just like that. Yes, there is a silver lining!!!   We went here on lunchtime for hubby's b-day (saturday) and the line was almost out the door (I was at the door!). The lobby was standing room only. The line for checking in seemed to go faster than I thought it would. We asked for seating in the dining room. A few minutes later, we went to our table in the middle of the dining room. It was busy (but that was a good sign). Our first sign of noticing the popularity was that the parking lot was crazy full.    Our excitement grew as we saw many other tables ordering what we were going to order: Fajitas for Two, $29.99 (two meats- choice of steak, chicken, pork, or shrimp, onions, peppers, tortillas (3 ea), beans, rice, sour cream, pico de gallo. Comes with fideo soup (small thin noodles in tomato broth soup). We got a kids meal for our little man: shredded beef burrito which came with fries. While we were waiting, we had a basket of chips with bean dip, three salsas (all of them were yummy and flavorful), with grilled onions- nice touch, and jalapeno peppers (sliced lengthwise).   I observed that there were seven TV's throughout the main dining room (that I could see from my vantage point). Two ladies were making fresh tortillas in the corner (I like to see that, because it's fresh). There were more tables and chairs than booth seating. It is dim in the room, but I think that adds to the ooh's and ah's from seeing the flame on the fajitas. The smells and aromas wafting throughout the space, was adding to the whole experience.  When it was our time to get the fajitas, oh man, it was excellent! Hubby noted that the meat was not overly salted (something I appreciate), but it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The veggies were also done to our preference (cooked, but there was still a crunch). This is a generous sized meal- we had leftovers (three containers to be exact). Our son said that he wanted to come here for his birthday. We really enjoyed our meal here and we were going to enjoy it the following day too (yesterday).     Nice staff, smiling faces, we were thanked for coming in, as we were exiting. It is clean. We were checked on several times throughout our meal. It is busy. But the turnaround was pretty good, as the attention to the table cleanup was prompt.   Since the restaurant is close to our home, I think that we have found our new go-to for mexican food, as the fajitas are quite memorable (our bellies were happy).",

Their al pastor burrito is amazing!  What I love about this place is not only the chips salsa and bean dip, but they also bring the sauteed jalapenos and onions as part of your pre-dinner appetizer   I love making those at home, so it was a nice surprise to have them come with our chips and dip.  I have yet to try their flaming fajitas, but everything that I've had there so far as been very delicious!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  This place is packed for many reasons.  First of all, the food is excellent.  The flaming fajitas is part show and part gimmick but it's very entertaining.  This is obvious with the name of the restaurant, it's their most popular dish.  The fajitas filling are well seasoned and the portions are very generous.  The chips and salsa comes with the meal and they give you three types.  Two out of the three is quite spicy and has an awesome kick.  The bean based one can be used to calm things down.  Very homemade taste and puts the crappy mass market salsa you get at the store to shame.  The comp soup is excellent also.  For folks who don't like the strong favor of parsley, think that you find the soup intriguing, it's as subtle of a taste of this polarizing spice that I could recall.  This along with the tomato base and rice, was tempted to ask for seconds.  Service is excellent and very friendly with multiple visits for re-fills and see how we are are doing.  Highly recommended.",

The complimentary chips are light and crispy and go well with the salsas that are flavorful, but not too spicy. I always order the shrimp ceviche which is a great quality of large shrimp pieces and definitely big enough to share. The fajitas are so tender and delicious; I've tried the chicken and the steak. It's a nice spot to go with friends. The only negatives would be the wait (usually 15-30 minutes) and with all of the fajitas sizzling and the smoke permeating the air, the ventilation could be better. If someone is sensitive to smoke, it could be an issue. I always smell like smoke when I leave and sometimes it does make me cough as well. But the food is great, so I will continue to visit.",

The fajitas were also very good with nice chunks of pork and decent sized shrimp.  The entree also came with a side of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de Gallo for each person, hot corn or flour tortillas, and a cup of their soap de video (tomato based soup with broken noodles.

I am happy to know that Juan's will continue to thrive, but the wait times have become somewhat lengthy due to their overwhelming popularity.  They have the best chips & salsa.  Everything on their menu is perfection; my personal favorites are the shrimp fajitas or the Guadalaja special.  Additionally, they have become more environmentally friendly by switching from plastic straws to paper and cardboard carryout boxes instead of styrofoam.  This is so cool; great job Juan's!!  If I could suggest just one thing to Juan's, it would be to open a location in Southern Highlands where we have no restaurant choices.  You would totally crush it in the SoHi neighborhood.  There's so much empty land around LV Blvd & Cactus....",

My parents were very impressed and they even brought out dessert on the house for my parents to celebrate their anniversary!!

We used to go to Buzz BBQ when it was there, and based on the amount of fellow diners joining us, Buzz can't blame their lack of crowd on the location.  Juan's was packed for a random weekday. I got the carne asada chimichanga, the meat was very good, I just didn't realize it was going to be served smothered in sauce,  which ruins my favorite part, the crispy shell. But it was still tasty. My boyfriend had the fork fajitas,  and the meat looked dry, but it was actually very tender, and full of flavor and not dry. He loved his meal! The staff was very attentive and full of energy!",

Barely tasted like alcohol at all but hey maybe I've just been getting some good margaritas EVERYWHERE else I go (including some pretty crappy chains).  Chips, salsa, beans, and jalapenos/onions to start. Great! The salsa had a nice spice to it. The jalapenos and onions were a pleasant surprise and tasted wonderful. I don't like beans but for some reason I liked these and ate more of them than anything else.  For mains I ordered a steak/shrimp fajita combo. Worst thing about it, WAY TOO MUCH FOOD! I guess that's not a bad thing but I did feel bad for how much I left. Every piece of it from the meat to sides were very good. The tortillas ended up getting very dried out since they were just brought out wrapped in some paper. This is something that should be figured out since it does take a while to work through the tortillas.  Overall great food, not good margaritas.",

I usually always get something different every time I come and it's always been amazing. The chicken fajitas have been my most common choice lately, but I do really like the chicken tacos and the mole. The service is very friendly and fast. I appreciate that the owners work in the restaurant and ensure that everyone is happy with their experience. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a delicious Mexican meal in the southwest.",

However 3 of a party of 6 ate the Shrimp ceviche; all three ended up with food poisoning and not only battled that miserable issue but were also forced to call out from their jobs while they recovered. A health and sanitation check is in order. Be warned!",

    "text": "Finally a solid Mexican feast that can fit into my low-carb lifestyle! Skipped the chips and salsa, but ate the grilled onions and peppers that come with it! Those peppers have some heat to them. What a pleasant surprise!  Ok, so I read a few reviews that said the food is not spicy at all.  I lean toward my food extremely spicy. They happily brought out a dish of habanero sauce but gave warning to use very little, since it was extremely HOT!!! I think I was more amused as they watched the \"little lady\" (ME) douse my food in it and eat ALL of it. Love that they have the option of grilled veggies instead of rice and beans.    I will say the carnitas was a bit dry and not the best I've had, but was fine with a bit of salsa and hot sauce mixed with all the veggies, it was more like a nice Mexican stirfry.    My husband got the \"flaming\" steak fajita, which is impressive at they brings it out a sizzling cast iron pan with a flame under it to keep it well...sizzling.  My husband enjoyed his feast of  fajitas with surprisingly flavorful rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, and  corn tortilla.  Guess what? We were pleased our food was not drowning in cheese, nor was needed or missed.  However, these servers were nice and attentive and I am sure they would have brought some cheese out if we requested.    I am sure to be back, nice service, decent Mexican food (finally!).  The Cantina looks entertaining as it is big lined with tvs, has a full bar, and even an outdoor area,  but it was empty since it was just shy of noon on a Monday?  Luckily they also have 4 TVs in the dining area too.   The drink specials look decent, affordable, and even tasty.   My one negative, is that I am not a fan of \"rustic\" aka cheesy Mexican decor and this place was dressed just like that...however, I focused my eyes on a 26th seed beating Serena Williams at Wimbledon.   Awesome that they had it on!",

    "text": "Probably the best fajitas I've ever had.  The service is very friendly and  great.  It has a typical cantina feel.  It was very clean in there. The chips are served with two kinds of salsa.  I only had the red, which was great and perfectly spiced.  They also served grilled onions and peppers to go with them, which is a nice touch.   I had the combination steak and chicken fajitas.  They were great and flavorful.  They brought them out sizzling on a cart.  And then they pour something on them and light them on fire. It is a neat presentation.  They serve them with soup (which I opted not to have, because I felt like it would be too much food), your choice of refried or black beans, rice, guacamole, and pico de gallo, as well as choice of corn or flour tortillas (I got the corn).  And the tortillas are made there at the restaurant.  It was awesome.  My only complaints are that the rice and beans were lukewarm.  It was alright though, because I put them into the fajitas anyway.  They brought the tortillas a couple of minutes after my food, which they probably were fresh from the oven, which was nice, but they probably should wait and bring everything at once.  The worst thing is that it is in the same parking lot as a crappy In-N-Out Burger.  I almost got into a wreck twice, with people trying to get to In-N-Out.  But I look forward to going back there again soon.  It's the closest thing to Tex-Mex, as I can find out here in Vegas.",

You can tell they make it fresh and not from mix. The staff is amazing. Very attentive and friendly. They are sincerely happy to have you there because of how new they are.

My husband got the 2 taco hard shell shredded beef combo and I got the beef fajitas. His tacos were bigger than most Mexican restaurants in the area. They were brilliant with their presentation because the tacos were laying on a flour tortilla to absorb the juice so your taco stays hard and doesn't fall apart when you try to pick it up. My beef fajitas were soooo good too. Oh, we got guacamole as an app and it was delicious as well. Great service, reasonably priced and best tasting Mexican restaurant style food in the LV area that we've had in the 10 years living here.",

Can't recommend it enough - if you're craving Mexican, go to Juan's and you'll have a great meal at a perfect price!  I honestly enjoyed every single thing we ate - the chips (fresh), the salsa (perfect), the soup they automatically serve before your entree, the fajitas, the dips, everything.  I will say it was all slightly on the salty side - but I *love* salt so that's right up my alley.  We ordered the chicken fajitas for 2 and, along with the free chips and salsa, and the tomato-based soup that comes out first, it ended up being 4 meals for the hubs and I.  Well worth the money.  And again, it was all so, so delicious!  The hosts and servers were all super friendly and helpful and everything was brought out quickly.  We honestly don't have a single complaint - except that we didn't go here sooner!  We'll be back very soon to try some of the others options like the quesadillas and enchiladas and I'm already looking forward to it!",

And for those who think Lindo Micochan is So Great - first of all, that place is terrible and Both times I went, service was lousy and the food was not only over priced but not even that good. Anyways!  My friend and I walked in on a Friday night with no wait, around 8pm. We were brought to a booth with a friendly hostess and no more than 4 minutes later we were brought chips with bean dip and salsa. Both were good.  Then a few minutes later, we were brought Fideo soup! That was unexpected even though it comes complementary at some places. I have to say, I'm not huge on this soup because nobody ever seems to get it right and I've tried it at a few places. This was by far the best Fideo soup I've ever had and was impressed already.  Our waiter, Amanda, was So Friendly and pleasant along with being helpful with the menu, it was very comforting along with the great soup and chips so far. I got the chimichanga with shredded chicken which came with a generous portion of sour cream and some guacamole and pico. I also got a taco with shredded chicken on the side with rice tortilla, fried. It was whoa! Ask for the house salsa with the taco or whatever you get and I recommend mixing in a little tapatio sauce. You'll be happy you did.  Great portion sizes too! All that and my friend got an enchilada burrito with veggies on the side. I can't believe they serve veggies on the side. That's unheard of, and I'm not talking about a few peppers and onions. No. It was broccoli, zucchini and cauliflower that filled 1 half of the plate and had really nice seasoning on it and it; so good with the salsa too! All that for $28. Go here if your'e craving Mexican food and I don't think you will be displeased :)",

I ordered Rajas y Crema which is my favorite Mexican dish and I order it wherever I go and see it on the menu. This was not good at all. I question the age of the chicken and pasilla peppers because they tasted super old! And the \"cream\" was separating. So nasty. Needless to say I don't think we'll be back.",

Food was alright a bit salty, the hit here is the flaming fajitas which they douse in vegetable oil in order to light. We did really enjoy the chips, salsa, and onion chile slices however we did not receive amazing service like most if the reviews. They took ten minutes to get our waters and soft drinks, and the pina colada my dad ordered was pretty much ice chunks and milk. After receiving our meal we had to flag them down to get refills and extra napkins or what not. Definitely not a high chance of returning.",

She thought all 3 items were excellent.  I had a chicken torta (sandwich) which also was very good.  The owner, Juan, stopped by the table and visited with us.  Now we know why all his severs are so hospitable as Juan was very engaging and let us know about the happy hour and other specials.  This place is a special treat and we will most definitely be back and will be bringing friends.  Great job Juan, keep it up!",

It was kind of a \"Lets try it\" sort of night and most of my group (2adults and 3 kids) were in cranky moods, so I might return to try it again and hope for better.  Finding it wasn't easy, the parking area is kind of poop but we found a good spot, luckily. They were doing some construction or set up in the porch area but that didn't really matter since it was kind of chilly when we visited. Sat quickly and our drinks were brought quickly. Bus boy was polite. Our waiter didn't really come check on us very quickly. Complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip was pretty good. Soup with meal -- the step kids loved it.   I ordered the taco bowl. It's my go-to since I'm not huge on Mexican food anyway. Food took it's time getting to the table, drinks weren't re-filled very quickly. Different waiter delivered our food but eh, at least it came. My chicken was dry and my bowl was soggy to start. The 1 out of 3 kids enjoyed and devoured their enchiladas and the other two just whined and played with it. Neither one could explain why they didn't like it. So it could just be picky children being picky. My guy ordered the fajitas and the waiter bringing our food forgot to bring the tortillas. It took another 10 minutes to get the tortillas and by that time we were ready to go.   It's not the restaurant's fault everyone was cranky. But the service was lacking, music too loud, and food not done well. I'm willing to try it again since the reviews from all you others are so good and I want to believe my visit was a fluke. =P",

    "text": "5 STARS!!!  Love this place.  I have to drive to get there but happily make the trip.  The fajitas are the best in town.  The condiments that go along with it are generous (grilled onions, peppers, avocado, pico, sour cream.  You get a choice of either corn or flour tortillas.   They also bring out an interesting cup of soup before the meal.  They also bring out hot bean dip and salsa and chips before the meal which is one of my favorite things about this place.   Juan, the owner is often there and working his butt off.  I wish they would open another location (ie. Summerlin would be awesome!!  (Juan, if you are listening).  What else to say about this place?  Everyone is friendly...service is great!!!! I love everything about this place.",

    "text": "Came to celebrate a coworker's Birthday. We had a reservation so they were able to quickly accommodate our medium sized group. At a quick glance, their lunch menu was reasonably priced.  Four people in my party ordered the fajitas which was a sight to see when they came out. They literally lit the skillet on fire and flames were jumping! After a bit the fire went out and we were served.   I had the flautas which I usually enjoy at other Mexican restaurants. I ordered it in a crispy flour tortilla with grilled vegetables instead of beans and rice. I was surprised that my order was really good! Although they had large servings, I took home my leftovers and had them for lunch the next day.   The reason why I can't give them the full 5 stars is, as I don't speak Spanish, some of the waiters spoke really fast English and I could not understand them. Additionally, I felt like attitude was given from one person serving us, who I think may have been a manager. Not cool.   Overall, I would probably eat there again if someone I knew wanted to go. I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, but I would definitely like to try other items on their menu.",

    "text": "There are a ton of really high reviews here, and I love mexican food so I was excited to try this place out, but my experience doesn't reflect a similar experience.   The chips were okay, kind of thin and tasted like some cheap supermarket chips. The salsa and beans were alright, not special but not bad at all. The non-custom standard guacamole was really good, but that was about the only thing I had that could be called really good.   My main meal was the flautas combination plate with grilled veggies. The veggies included broccoli which was absolutely ruined. It was grilled fast on high heat, which ended up just burning and charring the florets, and that's a very bad flavor to add to broccoli. The flautas themselves were okay, not special, I just kind of ate them until I was tired of them and didn't take home any leftovers. I feel like that's almost worse than giving me bad food. At least make me have an opinion about it, right? The shell was also cooked a bit too much, so was hard to cut through.  The wife was also unhappy with her meal, I forget what exactly she got but the tortilla it was wrapped in was super soggy on the bottom and not all that pleasant to eat.   The staff, however, was great. They were very attentive and treated us great. I'll definitely give this place a second chance for sure, if for no other reason than to try their custom guacamole option made table-side. Hopefully this was just a bad outing and they will live up to all these other high praise reviews next time.",

Right away we were treated like old friends. We were able to make a few changes, like poblano instead of bell peppers on the fajitas. Tamale, confirmed wrapped in corn husk and not the dreaded banana leaf. When asked weather they needed sauce, the answer was no, and they did not. The pork tamale was good enough to stand on it own without being smothered in sauce. I got the chili poblano pepper and it was excellent. Chips, hot sauce red, hot sauce green, grilled onions and peppers came when we sat down. Guacamole was chunky and fresh. It is kind of a shame to visit a place so good when you are from out of town because you will come back next time, and not eat at other places. On the bright side, you know you are not going to be disappointed. Real sopapillas - puffy pillows, not the fake flat ones.",

Chicken enchiladas and rice and beans you cannot go wrong at all . They also give you this amazing bean dip it is to die for . Definitely gonna be back sometime this week to explore the menu .

However, even though I was seriously underwhelmed by the service I didn't take any stars off for that - everyone has a bad day! We sat down 30 minutes before happy hour ended, and he would not give us happy hour pricing. So I guess my advice would be to finish your meal before happy hour ends!   So, without considering the service, this place is three stars. The food is alright. On the sampler platter, my quesadilla was underwhelming, to say the least. It wasn't toasted on the outside, which is how I prefer them, but even adjusting for that the cheese might as well have been from a can. The chips that came alongside it with refried beans were better, but the taquitos were basically flavorless. Shrimp cocktail is usually the saving grace of any Mexican eatery for me, and this was my least favorite in Vegas. It wasn't bad, I still ate it, but it wasn't good. If it was my first time having a shrimp cocktail in this style, I probably wouldn't have bothered to try it again.   If a friend wanted to try this place, I'd go back, but I wouldn't choose it on my own.",

The customer service was great and everyone was prompt and attentive which i appreciate. I ordered the steak fajitas- which they set on fire for you in front of your table and they were so good omg. The meat was tender, it was hot, and sizzling for a while. I also got the house margarita frozen. My bill came to under $20 for myself only. I think I found my new favorite Mexican spot",

A friend mentioned that many of the former staff of Viva had moved over to Juan's Flaming Fajitas, and suggested we give it a try. I am SO thankful they did!   Everything I loved about Viva can be found at Juan's, from the friendly staff that remembers regulars to the grilled onions and jalapenos served with the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip...    Every meal I have had at Juan's was been for lunch, they have numerous lunch specials daily, including a $3.75 lunchtime margarita.  We always sit in the bar area and get fantastic service.   Every item I have ordered has been fantastic, I especially enjoy the chicken flautas. And I LOVE that you can get steamed veggies in places of the beans and rice as a side, at no added cost.   Juan's Flaming Fajitas is not close enough for me to frequent for dinner, but for weekday lunches it's one of my favorite spots in town.",

They bring your fajitas out on a cart and set them an fire table side. It is a fun show and makes the meal that much better. These were probably some of the best fajitas I have ever had. I will definitely go back just for them.  The Staff: the staff greeted us upon entering and gave us all the available seating options (patio, bar, dining room) which was nice. They were quick to seat us and the waiter we had was great. He knelt down to our level to talk to us which made it more personable. He was extremely attentive and caring. He always asked us or anticipated what we needed before we even asked. Keep up the great service guy!!!",

It's like she knew us when I asked her if we should get the two person fajita or the single portion! The manager took time to check on every table in the restaurant which was much appreciated.  He followed up with our table at least twice.  What fantastic hospitality!  Our server suggested the single steak fajitas for both of us since we weren't too hungry.  We ordered it protein style with fresh romaine wraps and in addition we ordered shrimp ceviche and the churros and scoop of ice cream.  Gotta have balance!   The fajitas came out blazing hot. The food runner lit it and it bursted into flames... hence Juan's Flaming Fajitas.  The steak was juicy with a lightly charred exterior and it came with caramelized onions and peppers.  The shrimp ceviche was alright.  We honestly had better.  The churros were .com So get that with a scoop of dulce de leche  ice cream if you have space.",

Our server seemed interested, but never checked on us until long after the food arrived. The server delivering the food was in way too much of a hurry to even care to check that the order was even correct. So we waited until finally someone came over to check. Then, they kept interrupting while we were trying to eat just to keep apologizing.  I get it... you're sorry... are you trying to make me leave?  Summary: Food was \"meh\" at best, service was horrible. I'm hoping this was an \"off\" day because I really wanted to like the place.",

They even packed the complimentary chips and dips and soup into the take out, which is considerate. FYI, the salsa they packed us was so large, it lasted my boyfriend and I for three days. Definitely worth it.",

I got the vegetarian Fajitas....so so good. And so many veggies. (Their refrained beans are vegetarian too!) My boyfriend got the steak and loved it as well. The guac was amazing...no need to go for the table side-their house guac is so worth it.  And even with all the amazing food, the best part about this place is the service. Few times have I experienced such excellent service in a restaurant. Everyone was attentive, polite and nice. Even one of the bus boys brought us napkins when he saw the ones in our hands wadded up. I will be back and I will recommend this place to everyone!  Update: after writing this review Juan sent me a message ensuring I knew which sides they give with all meals had a meat base and let me know which I could get vegetarian. Even more respect for this place!",

Maybe lunch would be better  Now to the food --- right away they brought us our drinks with chips , salsa,& bean dip . Also a small plate of grilled sweet onions & jalapeno chiles nice ...I had a chile relleno & beef soft flour tortilla taco! I always order the relleno @ new places I go to & if it's good all else can't be to bad . My partner ordered chili Colorado with side of black beans  very good ! he does not like cilantro & I think the red sauce although yummy had to much coriander oh well ! All in all very hopping place will try again on a slower week day!!!!",

Salsa are pretty generic as was the beans.  Ordered a shrimp ceviche that was recommended by waiter but they seemed to forget about it.  Got the fajitas since that's part of the name.  Nice flashy presentation but pretty boring on the follow through.   Lacked flavor.  After asking the runner that we never got our ceviche, it finally showed.  It was okay but again lacked flavor.  Sadly, cucumber was most noticeable part which obviously shouldn't be the stand out ingredient.  All in all, a nice place but more for atmosphere than food.",

The peppers and onions were certainly a treat for my husband and I.  My Margarita was great.  The Chicken Flaming Fajita and Cheese Quesadilla were both very good.  The Chimichanga was not as crunchy as we're used to (that's part of what we used to like about it) and we got the regular one, which tasted like they just boiled the chicken in water and was VERY bland and gross.  The chicken that came with the Fajita was grilled and delicious.  Our waiter suggested we should have gotten the Grilled Chicken (Pollo Asado) Chimichanga instead and then it would have tasted better - wish they had recommended it back when we asked what Pollo Asado was!  There were so many other authentic looking Mexican dishes on the menu that we can't wait to go back and try something new!  Overall a nice spot with good ambiance - oh, and the busboy walking around singing to himself while he wipes down the tables is a HOOT!",

You can tell a lot about a mexican restaurant if they have good chips and salsa as usually the food is good I have found over the years. This restaurant is great and it might just be one of the top three mexican restaurants in Vegas. I love El Dorado but this is just right up there next to it.",

I still feel like this is the best mexican place I have found in Vegas, but to be fair I haven't tried anything but the fajitas so far. My husband has had the nachos on the happy hour menu before and enjoyed them. They have been busy each time we have gone, but we never have to wait long and everyone there goes out of their way to greet you, ask you how everything is, if you need anything else...etc. Top notch customer service for sure!",

    "text": "Great experience at Juan's!    It was my mid-week birthday dinner and we felt like we wanted to try somewhere new - so I turned to my fellow Yelpers.  Mexican is one of my favorite cuisines (along with everything else it seems) and when I read all of the stellar reviews - I knew I had to try Juan's.  We arrived in time for Happy Hour which let us try two different types of margaritas at a super reasonable price, the house and the Don Julio.  I found the mix a bit lacking in depth of flavor and thought that the house margarita might be watered down - but one sip into my second, and I realized these babies pack a punch! (Also evidenced by the pitcher-sharing table of seniors next to us who were getting into increasingly loud, contentious political conversations in the table next to us. Apparently I'm not the only person that gets sassy on tequila!).  The gratis tortillas chips were fresh and crisp - the salsa and complimentary bean dip tasty!  (Note that their regular bean dip isn't vegetarian - but you can request a veggie version! Love that!) The complimentary plate of grilled peppers and onions was delish as well.  We ordered the shrimp fajitas for two - with two different set-ups - rice & beans, steamed veggies, flour tortillas as well as corn. The best of all worlds and a great way to try a lot of different items on the menu for first-time visitors. When I missed taking a shot of the flaming of the fajitas - our waiter flamed them a second time for me - nice of him!  They don't skimp on the shrimp like some restaurants that serve fajitas in town - here they made up the majority of the meal and were good quality - nice and plump and perfectly cooked. I have to say, the side of veggies was really great - I don't know what they do to it, but it has some really great subtle additional flavorings in there.  I had jokingly mentioned that it was my birthday at some point, and the staff surprised us with churros with chocolate sauce and whipped cream - served up with a hearty version of \"Happy Birthday\" and a paper tiara with a sombrero on it at the end of our meal.  Awesome touch, you guys!    Overall, had a great time.  The service was great and friendly, the food terrific, the prices super reasonable during happy hour. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Welcome to the magical land of sizzling proteins and delicious drinks!!! The fajitas are really flaming! Oh man, why did I wait soooo long to visit?!?!? Came on a gorgeous Sunday evening, hoping to sit outside and enjoy the weather. The patio already had a large party there and our group was large too, no sweat, we can sit inside.  The restaurant is fairly large with a sort of divided dining are, a patio, and a bar that's separated. I like that it accommodates what ever type of night you're looking to have. Now the food! I absolutely LOVED the shrimp and steak fajitas! I typically don't order steak unless I'm at an actual steakhouse but took a risk and it paid off! The steak was tender, not at all chewy and had wonderful flavor. The shrimp was great as well. Perfectly cooked with flavors of pepper and onions it was cooked with. I really enjoyed watching the server torch the fajitas, a nice touch that adds flare to the dining experience.  The fajitas are paired with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, and freshly made tortillas - corn or flour. You're able to swap the tortillas for romaine wraps, as well as rice and beans for steamed vegetables. Great option for the health conscious. I personally would not sacrifice the flour tortillas for a few calories, they were delicious! Oh, the fajitas also came with a little bowl of soup! I really did not need it as, the table tortilla chips were pretty good and kept me busy while waiting for the food. Another star of the show for me were the margaritas. ON FIRE! I had the raspberry margarita that got me buzzed, followed by a shot of tequillaaaaaaaaaa, then a pina colada margarita... The Pina Colada Margarita was my fave, perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I look forward to having it again and again :) The service was good, it seemed to take a little while for us to get our order in but we did not mind as we were enjoying each others company. The drinks came right away though. I am not a die hard fan of fajitas but can have them anytime if they are from here. Really!",

So we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table hoping it was worthwhile.  Will I go back?  Probably not, but rest assured though, plenty of others will...It was packed, many large party tables and mostly with rug rat kids screaming.  Just not for me. Positives:  1.  Really cool thing is they have an internet based system so you can see how much longer you have to wait and who is ahead of you.  2.  They had chips and salsa waiting at our table for us as we sat.  The side of peppers was smart and a nice free addition. Negatives: 1.  I thought the Fajita's were fair at best.  Greasy and what I really don't like is leaving a restaurant with my clothes smelling like grease.  They add oil then fire up those bad boys.   Imagine the greasy feeling with nearly every table ordering fajitas.   2.  Stomach ache post meal and let's just say GI tract didn't sit well the next morning.      Ole!",

Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite. My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here. Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat. We will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!",

I generally get the pozole or menudo along with a chorizo quesadilla absolutely delicious!  Everything is seasoned well And piping hot.

Yum! The fajitas come out table-side, as the waiter creates a flame on them, before handing them off to you. Dinner and a mini show! The margaritas are my favorite there as well!",

My only negatives are that the fajitas had a TON of bell peppers and onions (disproportionately so to the steak) and the refried beans had no flavor whatsoever. Honestly these two things didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying my meal. I will definitely be back.",

I am usually pretty picky with my Mexican places since many places in Vegas seem to have either no flavor or are too greasy.  The service was absolutely fantastic, from the hostess to our server Omar, everyone was very courteous and helpful but not naggy or anything annoying.  It was great.  We were immediately seated and brought chips and salsa and our drink order were taken. We went with the pork and shrimp fajitas, and wow sooooo good. They light them up when it's wheeled out to you, super cool! The veggies, meat, and shrimp had so much flavor.  The tortillas were very fresh and warm.  All the sides: guac, cour cream, pico, beans, and rice were fresh and super tasty! I would definitely recommend this to any Mexican food lover or anyone who needs to be converted.  Definitely my new favorite place!",

Adrianna took our drink order and brought chips and salsa to the table before our kids could organize a protest. In fact Adrianna was incredible... drinks were always full and the chips never ran out.   Rolando our server was excellent. He'd visit with the kids and make them laugh.   Rolando and Adrianna made the dinner experience perfect for our large family.  I almost forgot the food. When the kids received their food... they were quiet. That's how you can gauge how good a meal is. My wife and I ordered fajitas for two and they were delicious.   Juan's will be a regular dinner choice for our family.",

That's how good the place is. We were told that it would be approx a 30-35 minute wait and actually got seated within 10 minutes! The chips and dips were delivered almost immediately as was our drinks. After 2 or 3 sips of our drinks, they were continuously refilled the entire time. Our entree's came out rather quickly also.

The bartender who's name is \"Juan\" (not the owner) can't multitask to save his life. I waited 15 minutes and he never even acknowledged me or said hi or anything at all. There were only two people at the bar and I was one of them. He just stood back there making drinks pretty much staring straight down not caring about anything else. I asked to be moved into the restaurant because of terrible service in the bar and then on the restaurant side my order was taken immediately by my waiter as it always is on my visits. Customer service goes a very long way in my book and unfortunately that guy has none. They might want to tell him to step his game up or get rid of him.  UPDATE: I was served again by that same bartender last week and he was on point and very helpful, so maybe the first day he was just having an off day.",

The atmosphere is clean, casual and open.  The staff are very attentive and friendly.  A lot of the staff are previous employees of Viva Mercado.  Our usual waiter, Hernan, is awesome and has great recommendations.  The grilled fish tacos and steak fajitas are excellent.  The fish tacos are not fishy at all and has a great charred flavor along with a generous portion of fish.  The steak is very tender and seasoned well, unlike some places where the steak is chewy and tough.  Overall this is our favorite place to go for great Mexican food.  Highly recommended. If you have a large party make sure to make a reservation because it gets pretty crowded at dinnertime.",

I always order the same thing which is a combo of a beef burrito and chicken taco. The burrito is flavorful and juicy. The chicken in the taco varies a little each time though and can either be juicy or quite dry, but when it is dry I just put salsa on it and it is fine. The staff is always super friendly and quick.   I've seen at least two other restaurants fail in this location, but Juan's seems to know what they are doing because it is usually pretty packed.  I am giving it four stars rather than five because the drinks are very inconsistent. Sometimes the apocalypse drink tastes great and other times it has so much alcohol I can't even drink it.",

Best experience in any restaurant EVER no matter the cost, country or nationality!  From the moment we walked in at 3:15 in the afternoon we were treated like long time customers (that tip very good) It was truly amazing.  The hostess girl at the front desk was so sweet and so nice and our server super nice, helpful and FAST... my only caveat is to be careful with the roasted peppers that come with the chips and salsa...Very HOT! Whew! but I recovered fast...  We arrived in time for happy hour and were happy to see red wine for $4.50 a glass and decided to do 4 different happy hour treats from the special menu.  We do this from time to time at different restaurants as we eat our dinner early so we don't go to bed with a full stomach.  When the food came we were shocked at the size of the portions! they were huge and each came with very generous portions of avocado and sour cream.  We had the fajita nachos and fajita quesadillas, shrimp cerviche and something else I don't recall.  Every thing was delicious and full of meat.  The cerviche was delicious, cool, refreshing and with lots of shrimp and avocado in it.  The red wine was tasty and everyone (including both the manager and the hostess) came by to see if everything was OK, at which time we gave them a total thumbs up!  We ended up packing up enough for us to have a light lunch in a day or two.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Excellent experience!",

    "text": "Wow!  We were going to hit \"In N Out\" while waiting on an oil change ,,,,, we saw this place and ditched the burger idea. Glad we did!  We ordered Taquitos ( i'm not really too hungry, my sweety says)  and I ordered Rancheria Tacos. With a margarita, and a cervesa. Quick and friendly service.  Chips were brought to the table, with salsa, bean dip, and grilled onions with jalapenos! Very tasty salsa and bean dip - and we massacred the onions , jalapenos :-) The taquitos - a massive serving, with guacamole, chopped lettuce and queso. Sour Cream, too. The Rancheria Tacos were huge, too. Same garnish as the taquitos ,,, so friggin'  tasty, awesome!  I don't precisely know what we expected, probably more mex food mediocrity, which is common, but \"Flaming Fajitas\" really exceeded all expectations for us both. We will be returning. The prices are very fair, the food was definitely a cut above, service was great, and the drinks were ice cold. Recommended. We'll be coming back here for sure!",

But be sure to call ahead of time to check the wait time, as they can get quite crowded on certain days! It sucks that we moved further away from this place, what used to be down the street is now a 15 min drive on the freeway, but it is worth it for the delicious food! And finally, don't miss dessert!

They took our drink order and brought hot, fresh tortilla chips to the table, along with a plate of grilled onions and grilled peppers, and several fantastic dipping sauces and bean dip. Our chips and drinks were refilled before we had to ask.  A delicious soup was brought to each of us before our entrees. The entrees were excellent, although after seeing the presentation of the flaming fajitas I was wishing I had ordered them. The service was impeccable. Such a fun atmosphere.

The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it isn't the most beautiful of places, just average. But it is still excellent Mexican food and service. and I would totally go back Tip: checkout happy hour times and try to always get reservations since they're always so busy",

We got called at the 25 minute mark. For the record, I don't like fajitas that much. I like the smell of the sizzling meat on the hot plate, but I don't really eat it. Like I love the smell of coffee, but I don't drink it. But I digress. We ordered a fajita for two with steak and shrimp and nopales (cactus leaf). Hubby, daughter and I split the meal. The steak had a good marinade. And unlike most fajitas I've seen, the meat was thinly sliced. It's not cut into strips. Those get dry easy. The dish came with all the fixings. There were so much food there was a ton of leftovers for my lunch tomorrow!",

Came here on a Saturday night and boy, it was packed! The wait for 2 was about 20 minutes. We walked out for 10 minutes and came back. We started realizing many groups who got here after us got seated. Roughly about a total of 30 minutes I checked with the hostess and realized our name was called way long ago (when we stepped outside in the first 10 minutes of putting our name down). The hostess quickly apologized and sat us down immediately.   The vibe is so cool, almost like you're in little Mexico! You get complimentary chips & dip, grilled peppers/onions and soup. We ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas for 2 which was way more than enough for 2 people! Everything was so fresh and delicious! Totally worth the hype.   I cannot wait to come back! This place is also great for kids and big groups of families!",

    "text": "Juans Flaming Fajitas was just ok for me.  Typical long wait on a Saturday for a known good restaurant. 45 mins- 1hr.  Hostesses were friendly.  Our waiter Omar was EXCELLENT!! He took care of our table with exceptional sevice. He was on top of everything. He checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything else , asking how are meal was and we never had to worry about our drinks being refilled. Service with a smile, professional, and extremely efficient. 5 stars for Omar.  The live music by the gentleman playing guitar was awesome!! We really enjoyed that. :)  Restaurant a bit too smokey for me. Yes, it's because of ALL of the flaming fajitas. Hence the name \"Juans Flaming Fajitas\" I know.  I smelled like mexican food the whole way home. If I come back, I will request the outdoor seating if it's available. ;)  Unfortunately, the food was too salty for my liking. The soup and my steamed veggies were packed with sodium I'm certain. I was unable to finish either. :(   Fajitas sadly the same. Too much salt. MY goodness! My suggestion- I would have liked the option to salt my food myself, if at all.   Ambiance was ok,  service was fantastic, dinner was clearly a miss, dessert  (fried ice cream)  was a hit though. That's how I arrived at my solid 3 star rating.  Alot of great things about this restaurant on Yelp. Based on service I would recommend. Definitely give it a try. You can decide. When you do, maybe leave a review. :)",

The service is perfect and your glass is never empty.. everyone works together to make sure the customers are taken care of. We had Jovanni as our waiter and he was really nice. He gave us tons of suggestions of food to try and had a great personality!!  Many friends of mine go here too and they love it. You won't be disappointed!!",

    "text": "This was my first visit, We wanted Mexican food so started looking around for someplace we have not tried before. Most of what we found where counter style places but this one stood out, so we decided to give it a try.     Its off on the west side so people from the strip over have to travel a bit but let me tell you ts worth it. They share a parking lot with some other businesses that are not open at night so plenty of parking. Oh did I mentioned its next to an In and Out?      The restaurant has to seating areas the bar and the main dinning. The bar looks a little dark compared to the main dinning but looked inviting also. We sat in the main area, let me tell you its a bit of show with flames shooting up from almost every direction.. They ignite the fajitas table side with a nice shot of tequila.  I myself have not tried them but they look fantastic  and smell wonderful.      The menu has lots of options and will cover just about any ones taste.  They start you off with chips beans and 2 salsas, one green ( which I preferred ) and one red (this on was a bit bitter to me ). But both tasty.       The staff is very efficient we did not have to ask for a thing. they kept us filled on chips and drinks and food was done in a timely manner and served very hot. The staff continued to check on us to make sure everything was on par. The food was fantastic, good flavor and you can tell not bag and box seasoning. Portion where large we had enough for a second meal at home the next day.     Juan's has become part of my top five in Las Vegas closer to the top of that list. I can say with confidence I will be back many times in the near future.         If you get a chance to be in the area of Juan's I highly recommend you pay them a visit.. you wont be disapointed",

Speaking of the bar and the post of homeboy jumping on top of it like he's at a restaurant's pay place. Juan's has very responsible bartenders and as soon as he started getting loud, they let him know, cut him off,  and gave him a chance to stick around. The man didn't know his limits or how to act. For that, he was quickly removed.",

The service was slow at best, and it took about an hour before our food arrived.  They did keep the chips full so it didn't seem horrible.   Today, we can't seem to get rid of the flaming fajita smell!  It's all over our sweatshirts and jackets and has even defeated a good spray with febreeze!  I thought maybe it was just me, but my son, who lives in his own home, says he has smelled like Mexican food all day.  I think I'll stick with Mi Casa Grill Cantina at Silverton Casino.",

Great atmosphere: was greeted and waited upon as soon as I got out of car. Horchata could use more sweetness, but still good. Chips came with free fajitas! Owner greeted us as well! My girlfriend like their salsa. HAd a burrito with green sauce ! OMG too good!  My girl had a mojo de ajo which was even better ! Fresh guacamole , delicious fried ice cream with plenty of whipped cream ! Even the rice and beans were delicious! Everything was hot and fresh. People were nice , staff was even nicer. Got attended by Arturo. Ask for him! He is a great server. Calm and well mannered , and always brings you refills. Never leaves you dry , which is my favorite part about him. Love this place , love the food. Taste authentic , and that's what I was looking for.   Will definitely be back !",

The problem was the quoted wait time which became two hours.  We kept being reassured they were attempting to seat us.  It became an issue due to our 16 year old wheelchair bound nephew.   I asked politely a few times about the wait.  A female manager approached us and actually used the words they were ADA compliance.  Really!!!   I have never felt so discriminated against before.  We've eaten there many times and it's never been a concern.  Tell you what I'll never step foot in there again.  And to add insult a cheese Queso was supposed to make up for the discrepancy in the extra hour quoted time.   If I was approached after 40 minutes stating it would be longer than expected we would have made other meal choice!! There wasn't an apology after our meal or even 10 percent off the bill.    As the aunt of a child that was hit by a car and to not have the courtesy of an acknowledgement I now understand the unintentional discrimination.",

    "text": "The tableside guacamole is the bomb! The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was lively. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. You must try the Parrillada De Mariscos.  I might have been in a review funk when I wrote my first review of this place. I thought it was strange that it had so many great reviews when I just couldn't seem to see past mediocrity.  I am glad I gave the place another try. My previous experience is leaps and bounds different from today's experience.  As soon as we stepped into the restaurant, the owner greeted us. Our server Amanda was very knowledgeable about the food. She made our guacamole at the table to our liking (e.g., jalapenos, onions, cilantro, salt, pepper, tomatoes). She also waited for us to try the guacamole to ensure we were happy, which is part of my definition of exceptional service. The chips were fresh, light, and crispy. Together this was a great beginning to our meal.   Amanda then made some recommendations for entrees.  I love when servers take the time to make recommendations or ask if there are questions about the menu. All too often I get servers that approach the table and ask, \"Are you ready to order?\" or \"Have we decided what were going to have?\" as though they are in a rush and we are just a number. I definitely believe that good service involves finding out what your customers want - and then making recommendations that you personally know will make their experience a lasting one.   The Parrillada De Mariscos for two was her recommendation since we both felt like seafood with a Mexican flare. This is a sizzling fajita style fish platter with scallops, white fish, shrimp, onions, and whole roasted jalapenos.  I wasn't courageous enough to bite into a whole jalapeno, but the flavor seeped into the seafood adding just that right amount of temperature and flavor to the combination of seafood. Plus, some color on top of all that sizzling yummy seafood whiteness was definitely well needed.   The tortillas were offered in either flour or corn. We were able to watch the tortillas being made fresh in the corner of the restaurant. The restaurant also has flowers throughout in beautiful vases.   Dessert was heavenly fried ice cream. I have had Mexican fried ice cream before at other Mexican restaurants, but this was scrumptious. The corn flakes seemed to coat the French vanilla ice cream like a puzzle. Then it was lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with whipped cream - and yes, a maraschino cherry.  I will come visit again!",

I've found a couple of good ones, including taco shops, but I still was searching for one like back home, San Diego,  CA. Today a co-worker texted me asking if I had plans for dinner.  When I didn't she suggested we get together and try out Juan's.  It had been highly recommended by a neighbor of her whose boyfriend is a chef.  So she figured, must be good! And it was really good.   I had the carne asada taco plate and the meat was cooked perfectly.   Just like back home at my one of my favorite restaurants.  While the tortillas were not made on site, they tasted close to it. The beans and rice were just like I like them. My friend had the fajitas and said they were also really good. Before you order, they bring the chips out with both salsa and beans.  I had never seen beans brought before with the chips, but it worked out really good. The service was perfect from the staff. No question, I will be back again and again!",

We took my brother there last week and he wanted a shrimp burrito. It was not part of their menu, but they made him one anyway and he said it was GREAT!  They are very accommodating here and always friendly.",

After moving out here to Vegas, we have realized how many mediocre restaurants there are and we haven't been \"wowed\" with any place but this one. The service is fantastic and the staff is so friendly. The complimentary fideo soup is always good. We usually order the beef fajitas which are never disappointing! This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas!",

Great deal on fajitas for two and they are delicious, the one thing I wish they would not have done is mixed our fajitas. My hubby and I ordered fajitas for two me shrimp and he pork and they brought the meat all mixed together well the only problem here is that I do not eat pork, beef or chicken. I'm not a total lunatic about it so I didn't complain but if someone was and they had ordered just veggie fajitas or if there was an allergy this would be a problem. I used to eat beef and chicken but hate pork and always have so um yea will just make sure to tell them not to next time and I just picked through it this time. Great guac, fresh ingredients and good service would take friends there.",

Beans were good, but lukewarm.  We ordered, New Mexico platter, chicken enchilada, fajita salad, and flautas.   Fideo soup was brought to each of us.  It was mildly spicy, but tasty.   Server apparently misheard or scribbled, and fajitas were brought instead of flautas.  No apology was given and our diner felt pressured to keep the fajitas, which she graciously did.  Food was good, but not mind blowing.  We were still charged for the fajitas, which were more expensive than the flautas, even though it was their error.  Again, no attempt was made to rectify their mistake.  For this reason, and the fact that I found a long strand of hair in the salsa, I am giving Juan's 3 stars instead of 4.  I will go back, but I will have the waiter repeat our order next time.",

They bring the Fajitas to the table and then throw on a large shot of clear liquor which instantly burst into flames.   We get the Steak Fajitas and the meat is deliciously flavored, soft - not dry and hard as so often they are else where, and mouth watering!   Of course you get the Nachos served immediately with both a hot dip and a hot bean dip.   With the Fajitas for 2 you get a very tasty cup of soup and then a large platter with rice and beans which are delicious.   The decor is simple with an outside eating area offered as well.   The service is fantastic, attentive and always give you the feeling they really want you to enjoy your meal with them.   On our second visit, though not our waiter, the waiter who had served us the last time checked on us several times to insure we were enjoying ourselves.   He actually remembered us from our first visit.   You can tell the staff enjoys working together and insuring that each customer enjoys their visit with them.   It has become our number one place to take visitors to eat and they are always impressed with the quality, amount and taste of their food!",

Everything was very good; the soup that came with the meal, beans, rice, guacamole, and salsa.  The portion is big and had extra for take home for another meal.   The service was outstanding.

It's family friendly which means there's kids everywhere! So many, in fact, that they ran out of highchairs on our last visit. The good news is it's the perfect place for antsy noisy kids because they are at every table and no one would notice.   The happy hour specials are great! The ceviche is generous and tasty. The quesadilla is huge and packed with meat and cheese. The house margarita is meh but the fresh ones and skinny ones are very good! The sangria was ok; the flavor was too muddled.   Our last visit with yummy food, leftovers to take home, 3 full bellies and 3 cocktails was only $48. Can't beat that! There is a singing guitar mariachi that serenades your table and is great with the kiddos too. Fun!",

    "text": "First I would like to give you a short history on my relationship with Mexican food so that you can fully understand how genuine my review is.  I was born and raised for 17 years in Los Angeles, where I was treated with fantastic Mexican food on every corner.  I moved to Las Vegas and worked in construction for 10 years, surrounded by Mexicans and their wondrous food.  I learned to appreciate everything about authentic Mexican food as well as learn their language.  The problem, there was no good authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas.  I have tried almost every restaurant Las Vegas has to offer, and I can tell you now, after visiting Juan's almost 10 times, there is no question that Juan's is the best.  You are always greeted at the door with a smile.  If there is no wait, you are quickly seated and if you don't like the table, the host/hostess is more then willing to switch you to the table of your choice.  The bussers  are always quick to respond to your table with chips, salsa, bean dip, and a plate of sauteed jalapenos and onions.  The salsa is the closest to Los Angeles style restaurant salsa I have found in Vegas.  My wife caught me eating it with a spoon yesterday.  Yes, it is that good.  The bean dip is the best I have ever had.  I can't explain to you what that really means, just know that Mexican food is my absolute favorite and I love my bean dip.  My wife loves to take the onions, dump them in her bean dip and eat them with a chip.  The flavor is pretty mind blowing.  I prefer to take a jalapeno, and put it on every chip dipped in beans.  If you like spicy or jalapenos, give it a try.  Beware because they staff will continue to replace the bean dip and salsa and attempting not to stuff yourself on these delicacies is a difficult task.  Juan has 8 beers on tap.  8!  For a Mexican restaurant this is quite unique.  I have sampled the Dos Equis, Negro Modelo, Victoria, and my wife's Budlight.  The draft is always fresh and the prices are amazing.  Their happy hour runs from 3-7 every day throughout the entire restaurant.  A 22 oz fresh draft for $4.50 is hard to beat.  Every Mexican brew is served with a lime.  I am usually almost full by the time the entrees come around but I try to find a way to fit them in.  I have enjoyed every item on their vegetarian menu, their flaming fajitas, their carne asada, and all their entree's have been excellent.  Their flaming fajitas have a great presentation and the portion size is rather large.  There is one restaurant in Las Vegas that beats Juan's just in the Fajita category and that restaurant is called Leticia's.  The reason is because Leticia adds mushrooms and zucchini into her fajitas.  I had to find a solution for this because my wife is a Fajita snob and I didn't want to go to a restaurant that lacks in all other categories because their fajitas were \"better\" (according to my wife of course).  The solution was simple.  \"Could we add mushrooms and zucchini to our fajitas?\"  we asked.  \"Of course\" was the reply.  And so, our love affair with Juan's has continued and my wife gets the fajitas her way, every time, and they are excellent.  This restaurant is the best Mexican food that Las Vegas has to offer and I would put it up against any place in L.A, anytime.  To all my friends that haven't had a chance to partake in Juan's, make time, you are missing out on life.  P.S.  If the staff makes any slight mistake, which most restaurants would shrug off, you will be treated with free churros and whip cream.  Pray for a mistake because they rarely make one.",

The guy who plays the guitar comes around singing, it was nice, but I had no idea what he was saying. $15 for a carneasada ( probably spelled it wrong lol) that includes rice and beans and a soup. Seriously ?! So much food for just $15. If I lived in Vegas I would probably go there every week.",

Their were grilled onions and red and green bell peppers mixed in with the fajitas.  The server brought the fajitas to the table in this large cast iron pot and set them on fire at our table!    The servers were very attentive and by checking in at Yelp, we got a 15% discount off of our bill!  Our sever gave us a free flan just because I mentioned it was my first time there!  All in all, we had an enjoyable evening and we will definitely go back again!",

First of all the service from Sebastian is some of the best I have ever had both times I was here. The chips, beans, salsas and grilled veggies are great. We got fajitas both times and they are great. Chicken is flavorful and the peppers and onions are too. Sebastian's helper kept our waters full, brought us more chips and kept used dishes clear. I will continue to go back when in town and maybe try something different on the menu one of these times.",

When I showed up, they couldn't find the reservation because someone had put my name down for the following Saturday. The managers worked swiftly to accommodate my party and got us right in at my appointment time. They were very accommodating and apologized for the mix up. They have outstanding service here over and over again and that's why I keep coming back. Thanks to the managers who went above and beyond to accommodate my party. I had a wonderful birthday and they brought out churros and sang to me as well! The food here is amazing and their margaritas are delicious! I love the mango and guava margaritas. Ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas for two and it never disappoints! Our server was very kind and took multiple photos for our group too. Thank you to everyone at Juan's who made my birthday very special!",

This place will turn anyone on to mexican food for sure. It is delicious and you get so much food for a very very low price.   I loved the steak fajita and the california burrito was also really yummy and unique. The churro dessert was very good as well. They also provide you with so many complimentary appetizers like fresh tortilla chips with multiple dips and they will give refills on chips or dips. We refilled our refried bean dip about 3 times because it was so delicious. They also provide a complimentary soup which was reminiscent of noodle soup with chicken broth. We went home with full bellies and lots of leftovers.   The service here was amazing. We came in 7pm on a monday and it was packed with a 25 minute wait. Somehow we were seated in only 5 minutes and our servers came by very frequently always refilling our drinks and dip and chips.   I would definitely recommend this place & I would love to come back again.",

They serve it and set it on fire at the table. Today we had three of us and each had three fajitas off the one for two. Delicious! I only wish it wasn't so far away. But definitely worth the drive!

I usually get the carne asada plate because of the preparation of the steak and they also have a steamed veggies option as a side which I always get.

    "text": "Got here on a Friday night around 6:30pm. They said the wait was an hour but it was only about 20 minutes so that was great. Food was tasty so if all you care about is eating some good food, maybe order to go.   Here are my issues: Their service sucks!   We ordered their namesake- Flaming Fajitas. This was our first time here and I specifically wanted to see the flames. The person who brought the cart over didn't say anything. He just lit up the food. I had my back turned and was engaged in conversation. I happened to turn around as the flames were lit and had to get the attention of the people at the table to watch the 7 second spectacle. If this was the only issue, it's not a big deal. But it wasn't.   Here's the main issue: The fajitas are served with a plate of rice and beans. I barely ate one fourth of it before the waiter asked to take it away. I would understand if my plate was empty but it wasn't. I informed him I was still eating. About 5 minutes later, he stops by and asks if I want to box up my food. I had another uneaten plate on the table which I was going to eat after I finish my fajitas. However, I felt rushed so I said ok to a box. I guess I'll just eat it at home. He brought the box and I placed it at the corner of the table so I could finish my first plate. He came by another two times to clear out dishes while 5 of us were still actively eating with no empty dishes to clear out. Dishes that my family were still eating from. We basically were being kicked out of the restaurant. We were not even asked if we wanted to order dessert which we were planning on doing. We were in the restaurant at the table for about 35 minutes from start to finish. I don't think that's too long of a time to be kicking people out.",

From the time we walked in the staff was so friendly, we had a large group and were seated right away, tables filled with chips, salsa, bean dip and peppers (all which were fantastic). Our waiter was very attentive and personable. Order guacamole for an appetizer which was so good. Drinks came right out. Food took a little long to come out but there was 11 of us and they continued to offer to refill chips etc. All food came out together and it was unreal. Every persons meal was delicious. Can't say enough about this place! Just wish there was one back home! Without a doubt worth a stop for dinner if you haven't been!",

Food is great, drinks are great, service is nothing exceptional but not terrible.   Had a carne asada burrito with green sauce from the one item dinner and two margaritas during happy hour. Everything was really decently priced and margaritas are a steal during happy hour. They give you chips, salsa, beans, grilled onions and jalapenos (and soup with your entree) before your actual meal so before you know it you've eaten your weight in chips and when your actual food comes out you're on the struggle boat trying to finish. All good though. I finished. Came at a cost but had to do it.   Btw, you come out of the restaurant smelling like their flamin' fajitas so make sure you've invited everyone you needed to because people will definitely know you were there and will be bummed if you \"forgot\" to invite them.",

I must say that we were not disappointed by their restaurant selection!  They gave us ample chips and salsa's to munch on beforehand and the service was great!  The place is quite the buzz, so expect to wait quite a while for your table and food once seated.  We had the Baja style Fish tacos and the flavors were a hit!  The portion sizes are crazy, so unless you feel like gorging and rolling out of there, be prepared to take home half your plate.  We were pleased that they allowed us to substitute the kids quesadilla plate, as we wanted no meat and only rice.  A to go box is needed for the kids plates as well!  Make sure you try their yummy churros afterwards, if you still have room in your belly!  They are cooked perfectly, not greasy, and the caramel adds to it's deliciousness!  My only regret was not ordering the flaming shrimp fajitas, as those looked amazing!",

I have to tell you that this place is not afraid to give an appetizer or some small token off appreciation for your visit, not ever time you go but it can happen, so that's cool. The queso dip blew my wife away. The food was excellent. I actually liked the camaron cocktail better at this place then some of the marisco restaurants I have tried in north Las Vegas.

At least the steak was stringy and the choice of vegetables was odd. (Who puts broccoli in fajitas?)

Like many others, really enjoyed the grilled onions and jalapenos that accompanied the chips, salsa, and bean dip. Nibbled off the niece's beef fajita (someone had to get them) plate; really tasty. The shredded chicken in my sister's chimichanga was flavorful. That surprised me as many places that I've tried seemed to have boiled the chicken leaving the diner to season with sauces and such. Liked the fact that a plate came with a grilled vegetable option versus having to have beans and rice. Also liked the fact that a cup of fideo accompanied each entree. I'm a carnitas fan and that was my only let down; I like bigger chunks of pork versus the small diced version. Had no complaints about the taste or tenderness of the meat though. Portion size was great. Definitely deserves a return visit next time I'm up that way.",

Portions are huge - 2 people can share many entrees and the fajitas for 2 could probably serve 3.  I don't normally leave reviews, but after the absolutely overwhelming mediocrity of the Border Grill at Mandalay Bay last night (all except the price overwhelmed), I had to review Juan's given it was spectacular in its own right, and spectacular x 100 in comparison to the bland, tiny, over-priced fare at Border Grill.  This was the Mexican fix the family was looking for before our vacation ends - I'll be leaving a recommendation with our hotel concierge.",

    "text": "THIS place has shot straight to the number one position in my \"best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas\" list.  There are a number of reasons as to why I think Juan's is #1 but for the most part: the food is fresh, cooked perfectly, unique, and consistently delicious; the service is probably the best I have experienced at a Mexican restaurant; their alcoholic beverages are nice and stiff (unlike most watered-down drinks at similar restaurants); the decor is actually really nice and comforting with great booths and TVs strategically placed around the whole restaurant; and, last but not least - the waiters and staff are AMAZING.   Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to our table within seconds of being seated. I really, really enjoyed the flavor and spice level of the salsa - it was unique, tasty, and definitely did not come from a jar.  The bean dip was great too.   I ordered fish tacos my girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas en Tomatillo after our waiter highly recommended she try it.    Before our food came, our waiter brought out some complimentary soup.  I'm pretty sure it was pizole or fideo, but I could be wrong. Either way, it tasted amazing and I actually finished the whole bowl. I never like the soup at Mexican restaurants, but the broth was so flavorful I found myself slurping up the entire bowl.   My fish tacos were pretty good - the fish was crispy and flaky without that soggy-ness that often comes when you do not eat the fish fast enough. I enjoyed them (although they are no Phranks!).  The REAL winner were the enchiladas. Ohmygod I have never tasted enchiladas so delicious, creamy and unique. They had onions and white sauce and cilantro and chicken and cheese and it took everything in me not to finish the rest of my girlfriend's meal when she left the table to use the restroom. I highly recommend this dish.   I will be back ASAP to try the flaming fajitas. The table next to us ordered some and all I could hear during the remainder of our meal were variations of \"mmmm, ohmygod, did you try this? damn this is good.\"    Also, we ordered a couple of Coronaritas, which were made with top shelf tequila,  and they were cheap AND fantastic.   I wish I lived closer because Juan's has a great happy hour and Mexican restaurants never have great food AND great service.  Juan's definitely gives all other Vegas Mexican restaurants in this price range something to be scared of ... because they all need to step up their game.",

He was short, despite me being very polite, and that frustrates me when I am patronizing a business.   I ordered the vegetarian fajitas, but was dismayed when I was offered a side of rice. As a precaution, I asked if the rice had any meat in it or if it was cooked in a meat based broth. Indeed, it is cooked in chicken stock. Okay, why, then, was I offered it if I ordered off the vegetarian section of the menu? 15 minutes later, I was brought a complimentary appetizer soup. Again asking the same question, I was told that this, too, had chicken stock in it. Hmm.  My suggestion to Juan: please tell your staff to not offer meat-based items to those guests who order off of the vegetarian section of the menu. Or, offer them, but indicate right then that they are made with meat-based ingredients.   When my entree came out, the pan was barren and a couple veggies that were listed on the menu were not served. And the taste was nothing to get excited over. There are two other Mexican spots in town that have delicious veggie fajitas, and these ones just left me yearning for more.",

The chips came out warm accompanied with salsa that had just the right amount of spice and a bean dip that reminded me of my long lost favorite Margaritas Cantina (at the old frontier casino), so of course that alone will bring me back!   We ordered the fajitas for two people for $25 (a steal in my book) and there was more than enough meat and veggies! The meat is so tender and flavorful that I didn't really even need all the fixings. But I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the guacamole tasted and used my chips to truly enjoy the taste instead. The rice and beans were also quite good.   This place is about 20-25 minutes away from our house but we are already planning who we want to bring!   P. S. Service was great!",

Only tough part is it's always busy, so hard to get seats unless you come earlier before meal time. Worth the wait, though!! Service is great, too. Good job!!",

    "text": "The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.  This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.  What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapenos. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed \"now that's service!\" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.  The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.",

Not only were we presented with warm tortilla chips, but they also gave refried beans and grilled onions and peppers as well.   My husband ordered chicken fajitas and I ordered steak and enchiladas. YUMMY is pretty much how I can sum it up! Best meal we had in Vegas out of a total of 4 days.  The service was second to none!

Figured with all the great reviews we would be getting some great food.  One. Let me say that the hostess at the front is a 5 star. And the ambience in the restaurant is a 5 star. But what else I experienced there means they receive a 2 star overall.  Our waiter wasn't the greatest. When we started ordering he kept trying to up-sell everyone to one particular dish. I don't didn't catch on to it until after he left the table and we realized that my teenage daughter ordered something he said she should take instead of what she wanted.  When the dish came, I looked at it like \"she ain't going to eat this.\" One. It was freaking massive. It was fit for 4 people. Not a 115 lb teenager. Two. I had realized that was the same dish he tried to upsell me on and that I said no to. Why the hell was he trying to up-sell us this particular dish? Was it because it was more expensive? Was it something he personally like? I don't know. But I would figure when someone says that they want something specific just let the order be done and let it be over with. There's no need to upsell. Noticing the commotion on our table, another waitress came to the table and asked if everything was okay. I explained the situation to her and she said she would take care of everything. At that moment the other waiter came back to the table and asked if my daughter would like what she originally ordered instead. Interesting Lee, he knew exactly what the dish was and did not even have to ask her he said he would just bring it right away. Now I'm not no food kinda connoisseur but I do love food! But I cannot under any circumstance understand what the big hype is about this place. This is not authentic! And I mean not even close! I mean all I had was tacos. And even that was not good. How do you serve a not good taco? Me and my wife and my youngest daughter ate maybe half our dishes we weren't exactly thrilled with the flavors. My oldest daughter the one who was up sold and then got the dish that she did one scarfed all her food down but I think it was more out of thinking she was satisfying me in some way rather than enjoying the food. The rest of our evening they're followed with a thousand offerings of refills of our drinks even though we constantly said no the offers would not stop. And oh joy, much to my delight a $75 bill 4 Non authentic food. I'm sorry but I was not impressed. This is Las Vegas, there are way too many authentic places to get this food then to come here and pay $75 for something that did not taste good at all. Again, this is just my experience I can't say that that is the experience of everyone and I'm sure to some their food is great... just not to me.",

I've eaten there for a girls night out & I've also went with family & young children. I love seeing the actual flaming fajitas come out because the flames are enormous & fun to watch.   If you enjoy authentic Mexican food, rather than the Americanized Taco Bell version then definitely check this place out!",

They flavors were great while sizzling on the pot and smothered with cheese. We both were served sopa fideo, which of course was tasteful. We will definitely be back for more! They also have happy hour on drinks and food daily from 3p-7p. The service was also great, the buzzer and server were on top of everything.",

We had the 3 combo dish (chicken enchiladas, 2 beef tamales), beef taquitos appetizer and chicken quesadilla appetizer.  My wife liked the chicken enchiladas. We enjoyed the chips very much. I thought the tamales were terrible (seem like frozen that was baked in oven after since it was dry and a little burned). Beef taquitos were large burritos like that was deep fried and wasn't crisp as I've had before in other good restaurants. Chicken quesadillas were terrible with the chicken being shredded instead of grilled chunks thus it was wet inside. Service was pretty good considering it was busy for a Tuesday. I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews of this place. Maybe locals haven't tried really good Mexican food to compare but this place definitely isn't 4 nor 5 stars!! Vegas has lots of great restaurants so don't waste your money here i say.",

Juan's gives you a TON of food so bring your appetite.  You're started with homemade chips & dip, then soup, then your meal.  We always get the Steak Fajitas for 2.  Expect to bring some home.  Lots of steak & veggies seasoned to perfection. Happy hour is 7 days a week but either get there early or expect to wait.  The parking lot is the only negative.  In-N-Out burger is next door & that place is ALWAYS busy.  Hard to find parking during peak hours.  Fast, friendly service. Highly recommend.",

I chose the mango margarita and shared a shrimp cocktail with my husband before trying the famous flaming fajitas. Good size portions, you can easily share. The small cup of fideo is a nice touch, It reminded me of home.  I loved that the food is not overly salted. In the end, i opted out of dessert but one of the servers convinced me to try a shot of mezcal. Few slices of fresh oranges and I was in heaven !! This is a super friendly atmosphere, even the manager came by to check on our dining. Will have to come back next time I'm on that side of town !!",

Yajarita was our server - attentive, friendly, and informative she took very good care of us. A gentleman (no name badge) frequently refreshed our beverages, cleared empty plates etc. We told Ramon, the manager that we were very impressed and appreciated how professionally we were served, and the food was excellent. We travel a lot for business throughout all 48 contiguous states, and now have a favorite Mexican resturant 2,000 miles from our home! We'll be back - perhaps not frequently, but as often as we are in the Las Vegas area. The veggie fajitas brought the most acclaim, followed by the chicken, steak, and shrimp respectively. The wet burrito rounded out our group of five, and everyone was VERY pleased with their meal. Portions were large enough to require three take home containers for enjoyment later in the day. Solid five for our experience - we suggested to Ramon that they open their next resturant in Michigan!  Hope you enjoy your meal should you select them too.",

And then just in time to order from their happy hour drinks (starts at 3pm).  The meal starts off with complimentary chips & two types of salsa, a bean dip, and grilled onions & peppers. It was all SO good--especially the grilled onions and peppers.   My boyfriend and I ordered steak fajitas & a chicken burrito (comes suiza [topped with red or green sauce & cheese]) and added lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. It was all so delicious!   As other reviews state, the margs are definitely strong.   To top off our meal, our waiter also let us use the Yelp deal! Four of us dined for about $46--which was a steal! Of course we tipped well because the service was phenomenal.",

It was a distance from the strip but let me tell you, IT IS WELL WORTH THE DRIVE!  First off just the smell of the food walking in was captivating. The decor is festive and bright. We got the chicken fajitas for two. Omar was our server and he was as good to us as the food tasted. A huge plus (unless you don't want to gain 10 lbs.), is they give you so much food!   I recommend anyone looking for really good fajitas, maybe even the best you've ever had, this is the place to come to!",

I've had quite a few friends highly recommend this place and we were willing to look past her negligence. The food is amazing, you get 2 different salsas bean dip sauteed onions and peppers oh your chips right when you come in, food is served fast and everything tasted amazing!

There's been a few times where the hosts told me it'll be a 30 min wait but in actuality it'll be closer to 10 min.   You get complimentary chips and three different dips. I can seriously finish a whole basket of their chips because they're that good! For entrees, I usually get the steak fajitas protein style with romaine leaves (instead of tortilla) and side of steamed veggies (instead of rice and beans). Gotta balance it out after eating gorging on those chips.   Servers are always friendly and there's never been a long wait for the food to arrive. The bus persons are quick with clearing your dishes and making sure you have everything you need.   I haven't had a chance to try their desserts yet but that's next on my list!

The chicken was absolutely delicious.  It was so good we decided to come back within a few days.  But the return visit was horrible.  We tried to order what we'd had that was so good..the chicken tacos but these were nothing like the last ones..the last ones the chicken was grilled and we'll seasoned, the taco shells soft and tasty.. these were bland shredded sopping wet chicken on rubbery shells. The waiter was nice in exchanging it, so we changed to basic cheese enchilada and a chicken burrito.  The burrito came with the same swampy shredded chicken that was found in the taco, the shell wasn't even cooked.  It was truly gross.  Again the waiter exchanged that for a cheese enchilsda. At this point dinner was ruined and we'd had to wait over an hour to eat.  The waiters were nice and one told us the mgr only charged us for a single combo each, as if that was doing us a favor...but thats all we ended up with, so not sure what the favor was other than to mot charge us for the disgusting food?  Turns out unbeknown to us, the first time a week ago we had a waiter who just gave us the better grilled chicken dishes..but we didn't know it so when we ordered, we did exactly what we had the first time.  What is puzzling is why they even have the shredded dish as it makes the food their look bad, even the waiters said the other was better.  Bottomline..it was a huge hassle, ruined our appetite and evening out.  Not anxious to return anytime soon based on tonight.",

I saw the reviews and thought if it has more than 1,000 it must be good. We went on the first day anxious to try and found our wait time to be an hour and a half. It was too much time to wait, so we decided to go another day.  The next day, I called and asked the wait time. They said it would be 30 min, but as soon as we arrived it was 50 min. We decided to wait and it was a great decision. Our food was delicious and very filling (parrillada, al pastor burrito, pozole, and much more) but what made it so great was our waiter, Paco, and his teammate, Angel. They always made sure our glasses were full, chips were filled, and anything else we needed. They made the experience a great one with their laughs and jokes.   I totally recommend this place. If you happen to have Paco and Angel serving you, you will without a doubt have a great time and leave with ur tummy full.",

But be prepared with an empty stomach. Before we were seated, they already had two types of salsa, bean dip, roasted peppers and onions with chips.  And BOTH salsas were fantastic. They nailed both and for me the salsa is the most important piece as it becomes the indicator for me as to the meal to come.  We had a steak, seafood combo in a red/orange sauce that was fantastic.  And a chicken burrito covered in red sauce was solid as well.  Pollo Asada was very tender and seasoned just perfect.  So big we took half home.  Service overall was outstanding.  We will most definitely be back.",

    "text": "Craving Mexican tonight and with my 3 best girls and we did the old where should we go game... after rattling off the usual spots, we opened trusty yelp and the Flaming Fajita popped up as a hit and so we decided to give it a go as two friends had given rave reviews.  Location was in a strip mall and parking was a little tight but once we got into the restaurant it felt nice and cozy ... it  was split between a full bar section and full dinning with TVs and Mexican decor.  Comfortable seating and when some restaurants are uncomfortable when packed, it was actually nice.  Menu was an excellent selection and a great variety of many options from tacos, enchiladas, burritos and chimichangas to some very ethnic meals.  We were greeted by the best waiter we have had in a long time, Christian was on the ball, had excellent recommendations and was so very friendly, he made us feel like fast friends and regulars.    We ordered our typical order for a new place to make sure we like the menu, starting with a large Guacamole for the table that accompanied beans, salsa and tortilla chips, then for entrees,  Chicken enchiladas suiza style,  California burritos (one with steak the other with chicken),  One taco al pastor  and a kids meal with a cheese quesadilla and fries. All meals came with Fideo soup and rice and beans . Ok, so now that I told you the order, let me tell you how amazing the food was.  Now, if you follow me or have read some of my reviews, you know that I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food and so I have to have my friends who love spice be my testers to make sure I can handle it.. sadly the salsa was a fire maker for me (see wimp) but I could handle the beans (ha ha ha) and the guacamole was delicious and fresh and the hint of lime was perfect. Just make sure you don't eat too many of the chips (you will thank me later as the portions are huge) the fideo soup comes next,  and it was a very light, tomato and noodle broth that was a great pallet lightener from the guacamole and beans (and those that can handle the salsa )  Then the meals came out  The Burritos were huge!!! We have enough left over for breakfast and lunch and the meat was so tender and juicy and full of fresh flavors. The taco al pastor did not disappoint, we all tried each dish and couldn't say which was the best but I did love the chicken enchiladas with the corn tortillas and the creamy sauce, I could only eat half.  We did see many tables order the \"Flaming Fajitas\" which looked and smelled amazing, (another must try for our next stop). We sadly did not have room for dessert but will be back and start with dessert then.  We were not disappointed at all with anything, the service was excellent from our waiter Christian (who we will ask for again!!) to the service help staff keeping our drinks topped and table cleared of empty plates..and the hostesses were on the ball to make sure we got a great table.  Will be eating here again!",

I got the tamale and burrito combo.  The tamale came with green sauce which was pretty good.  However, the beef burrito with the red sauce was extremely salty.  It was probably the sauce which probably came out of a can that did it.  It was so salty that the next few hours I had a raised heart rate!  I am healthy that wasn't the issue. The service was very good and polite but attendants asked one too many times how we were doing.   Another thing I thought the utensils were too cheap and fit for camping.   You would think they would have better ones.   Since they do lit the fajitas on fire next to your table, the place tends to get smoky as will your clothes.  It would have been a better experience and the rating better if only they wouldn't put a ton of salt on the food!   One's health matters most than anything else doesn't it?",

I asked for no rice and they offered to replace it with steamed veggies. I was very happy.  They were able to make a dirty martini and it was only $5.50 which is half of what I was expecting it to be (grey goose vodka too)  The service was very good. The workers were definitely hustling... Very quick to refill water, chips, and take away finished plates.   The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my boyfriend asked for the steamed veggies too, but was given rice instead, and some of the chairs were cheap and looked like they belong in a cafeteria.",

The DH had the tamales. He enjoyed them. Said they were quite tasty. The portions are generous. Both plates were enough for two. We had plenty of leftovers and no room for dessert.

They put on a go show for the  fajitas, but the fajitas are barely average.    Mole sauce is better then some in town, but it still tastes out of a jar.  Tamales are sub-par, tacos...well who can f-up taco, their tacos were good.  Chili verde was aweful but not great.   I could go on and on.

Service:  The food was really good but the service was ridiculously slow.  We came here for my coworker's birthday so we have a large party of 11.  I understand that with a large party food sometimes take longer to come out.  However, it is not a reason to make the lunch a 3 hour event.  We looked around and saw that they were a bit understaff so we were a bit patient with waiting.  I was the only one in the group that ordered a margarita because a lot of people said they were great here.  But they managed to forget my drink, it was even harder to wave someone down to remind them.  Alas, I never got it. I'm just going to assume that it was never in the system.  With all the waiting and how long the meal was, one of my other coworker just got up and flagged down the waiter to get our check and paid the bill so we didn't have to wait for split checks. I don't even want to imagine how long that would've taken.  Conclusion: I would tell people to try this place but please only do it when you know you do not need to be somewhere after the meal just because you never know when you can leave.",

My friends were visiting from out of state and were craving Mexican food. I've never been here, but I went onto Yelp and searched \"Mexican food\" and this place popped up. I'm glad it did because the food was DELICIOUS! I ordered Enchiladas which were fire! My husband ordered a chimichanga. My friends ordered fajitas and a burrito. I wish I remembered all the names of our order but again, I was focusing on the presence of my friends. I just had a lot of excitement to see them again!!:) And the portions were HUGEEEE. So filling, we ended up taking our food home. Except for my husband, he just eats a lot lol. The restaurant is a bit overwhelming. When we arrived, we sat down and were immediately given salsa and tortilla chips. We thought that was awesome, then like 10 mins later complimentary noodle soup was given to us. I think it was some type of authentic Mexican soup, but it was yummy:) I wish I had more but the portion size was small. Out of nowhere came a man singing in Spanish and playing the guitar. We thought that was a bit overwhelming and told him to just move along (otherwise you'd have to tip). Overall, we were all having a great time. :) I am very pleased with the food, but I think our server needs to learn how to deal with customers and provide exceptional customer service. I dont know if it was the fact that we looked a bit young?, but we did order alcohol... Oh well, I am still satisfied with their food and will def be back:)",

    "text": "I'm seven months away from the magical world of breakfast tacos and salsa on every corner (i.e. Austin) and taking my annualish pilgrimage to Las Vegas to party it up with my family when I have a serious craving for some southern style noms. With my favorite Mexican restaurant closed and only mediocre experiences at others in the area, I turned to Yelp to see what was new.   Juan's was sort of on the way to the Orleans Arena, so I talked Mom into stopping there for lunch on the way to the Wranglers game. We parked right out front and headed in. Mom immediately noticed a giant jar of peppermints--a sure sign of a restaurant that cares about its patrons. We were seated promptly in a booth (always my favorite) and delivered chips, salsa and bean dip. YUM. Shortly after, complimentary vegetable soup with a tomato base. TWO YUMS.   As far as options go, there's something for everyone. Several vegetarian dishes were offered. Mom picked the tamale and I ordered the enchiladas, which came with your standard delicious rice and refried beans. It all seemed pretty healthy, my enchiladas stuffed with zucchini, broccoli and bell peppers--unusual fillings, but I liked the mix.   Everything was clean, including the bathrooms, and large screen TVs were scattered throughout the dining area featuring sporting events. The manager (owner?) stopped by our table for a chat and gave us the history of the restaurant and the building (formerly a BBQ place--my father would be crushed.)   Service? Super important to me, and spot on. All in all, an excellent experience. Can't wait to go back!!  Edit: totally forgot about the onion/green pepper relish. SO GOOD. I don't usually like onions, but I ate as many as I could stuff in my mouth. They also appear to have wifi for guests, but I don't know how to get the password.",

At the end of the meal, the owner came to talk to us and ask us how our food was.  This place is new and there's not much decoration, but there's enough.  I love love love that they have a vegetarian section in their menu.  The menu has 6 different vegetarian plates.  I ordered the vegetarian fajitas with no sour cream or cheese and it came out flaming and on fire.  It was a pretty cool presentation of it.  The servings are big and I was full after eating 2 fajitas. My bf ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and he said it tasted good.  We both had leftovers to take home for tomorrow.  I also our love our bill and how it $20 for the both us!!  It's hard to eat out at restaurants nowadays for two people and pay $20 for the meal.  This place also has happy hour from 3pm-7pm.  If I can remember correctly, the happy hour menu has nachos, fajitas, and something else for like $5.  They also have alcohol for happy hour too.  I think this place will give Frank and Fina's and Lindo a run for their money.     I will definitely come back and try more stuff on their menus.  I'm gonna try hard not to stuff my face with chips, salsa and bean dip so that I have room to order dessert!! :)",

We started out with some tableside guacamole, I like garlic and roasted jalapeno in mine so it was just okay. We probably won't get it again, also, because they give you SO MUCH stinking food for the fajitas. When the server arrived with our chicken and steak fajitas they light it on fire with I'm guessing is tequila? Correct me if I am wrong. We OHHHH'd and AHHH'd!! With your meal comes soup which was DELICIOUS (the hubby paid a bit more to get the pozole soup, just lacked some salt) and each person gets their own sides of beans, rice, sour cream, pico, and guac. You also get a choice of 6 flour or corn tortillas. There was so much food I didn't touch my beans or rice, you could easily share this with 3 or 4 people. The chicken was BANGIN' the steak not so much, I found it dry and tough. Next time we want to try to shrimp!!   OH before I almost forgot. The chips and salsa are pretty good, not the best I've had but the best I have found in Las Vegas!! The service was mehh which is why I knocked a star off but I am more then willing to give it another shot.",

They make it however you want and both times it has been good, although the second time they put too much lime juice.  However, they immediately offered to put more avocados in it to balance out if we wanted.  The fajitas themselves are great.  The flavor is excellent and I have enjoyed them more than your standard fajitas at any other Mexican place or applebee's type joint (although that is not saying much).

They were so on top of it, sometimes they flew by and stared at tables to find something to do.   And of course, stellar food.",

Meals are served with grilled chiles and onions, fresh homemade tortilla chips with assorted salsas. Yes, simple Mexican food, but this was MUCH better then anything in recent memory.

One , let me start by saying thank you for letting us reserve a large party of crazy ugly Christmas sweater goers ! We reserved for 8pm and we're sat by 7:45 . That was the best , feeling like we mattered !  Most of us were there early enough to enjoy that last bit of happy hour , Jose uno and Jose dos were hilarious . With a full bar , and plenty of our party (of 15) crowding 5 chairs they ensured everyone had drinks and we all got paid out - on different checks may I add and they handled it perfectly !   Once we were seated we instantly had baskets of fresh chips and dips . Arturo was able to grab a few Vegetarian beans for a very picky vegetarian (me) and came back with a quickness with 2 bowls ! Oot !  With the party not having seen each other in a few months , most were lost in conversation but Arturo got drinks down with patience especially with a few of us really feeling those bar drinks . LOL . It took a little time figuring out what we wanted to eat but we were checked on regularly to ensure full glasses and extra rounds were taken care of. (Kudos!)   Once we got the food order in , swear , it was record timing with 15 orders of food coming out ! Everything was hot and steaming and everyone quit talking to eat . That's how good it was , you guys shut up 15 very hungry Christmas-ers !   Many of us couldn't even finish the food we were so full from the bomb @$$ dips and salsa . But trust , it still tasted great the next day !   I got lucky , and got to wear the sombrero for my birthday ! 6-months late ! Hahaha they were such sports and got the entire group of servers that night to come over and sing . It was hilarious ! We had enough churros , topped with whip cream and chocolate and Carmel . Mmmmm so freaking good , but enough to share for the entire table .  It was purrfect to top off my full belly of nachos (clearly I love the chips and dips) and the other belly's full of burritos , wet chimichanga and fajitas !   Also , frozen mango margarita with a spicy rim . GET IT . Those alone will make you keep coming back .   The photos are some before and after cause some people actually finished everything (champions)   I would totally tell people to check either location out , they are SO worth the experience .   Thanks again Arturo for being amazing that night and having fun right along with us .",

And it was soggy vs. crunchy =(  The taco, rice, and beans were good though.  The service was superb and is what'll bring me back.

The music is wonderful and not mariachi. They have a really awesome deal 3 items for $16. It's definitely plenty. The salsa is great. The flauta and taco are okay. The best thing ever is the Chicken Picado!!! It is the best chicken I think I've ever had. I couldn't stop stealing it from my friend's plate.  Also, they have incredible margaritas. Would definitely go back.",

However,  because of the wait the parties ahead of us were dropping like flies and we were seated in 15 minutes.   We were given our complimentary chips and salsas immediately and our server got us our drinks right away.   Their selection of drinks with free refills was great.   I loved their horchata and am impressed that the refills are free.   We got shrimp and steak fajitas for two which was so much food for 2 people.   I think 3 or even 4 people could eat from this meal.   The food was very tasty and came out super quick.  I can't wait to come back!   I'm very exited to try their tamarindo and some desserts!   Definitely worth any wait you may encounter!",

This is some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. It beats Lindo Michoacan, Benito Michoacan, and even Border Grill in my book. Factor in the price and it's a triple threat.   I'm pretty sure this restaurant truly has some of the best fajitas in the valley. The meat they use is very high quality, their produce is fresh, and everything is spiced to perfection. It also doesn't hurt that you get a show with the meal when you order the fajitas.   Their chips and salsa are awesome, served with salsa, refried beans and grilled peppers and onions. Because the wait staff is on fire (badum ching) they keep them refilled too.   The only thing that keeps this place from being five stars for me is their chile verde. It's good, but not great. The pork has been a little bit fatty at times and the flavor could be a titch more complex. I know its the base for verde, but I like my chile verde to taste like more than just tomatillos. It's still good though.   If you stick with the fajita's your meal won't disappoint you!!!",

My husband and I aren't huge fans of fajitas so we haven't ordered them...yet. The fajitas roll out of the kitchen every few minutes and smell and look delicious. I ordered the street tacos last time and tonight ordered the sampler appetizer platter, happy hour price was $8.95 and it was giant and delish! We ordered the queso fundido both times and it's simple, cheesy and so tasty. We asked for tortillas with it instead of using the chips and the tortillas are so fresh, I could eat them all day long! The only thing better than the food is the service. I had to give my compliments to the manager and I also wrote it on the check because as busy as it was, the service was excellent both visits. This place is about a 15-20 minute drive from our house but worth the drive!",

    "text": "We stopped here yesterday for late lunch/early dinner.  Since it was Sunday, they had a brunch menu but neither of us were interested in that.  Immediately after being seated, we were asked about drinks and two iced teas were brought quickly.    After looking at the menu for awhile, my wife opted not to have the fajitas for two but ordered the chicken azado Vallarta style--salsa Espanola with capers, banana peppers, and olives.  I ordered the flaming fajitas.  After all, it's the name of the place and that's why I stopped.  We were brought chips, salsa, bean dip, and a small dish of grilled onions and one half of a grilled jalapeno.  Standard fare except for the grilled onions and jalapeno.    In a short time, our dinners arrived.  Mine was flamed near the table but far enough away for safety.  The fajita pan is a high pan with a circular top.  The chicken, peppers, and onions were nicely grilled and the flavors were very good.  My wife's chicken was good, and it was a very large portion.  I have leftovers for dinner this evening.  It was one whole chicken breast.  Not finishing her meal allows my wife to justify dessert.  I need no justification.  We shared an order of fried ice cream that was very good.  The crust on the outside was tasty and the ice cream was nice to have on one of our 100 degree summer days.  Service was excellent.  Multiple people came to check on iced tea refills, was it OK to remove dishes, anything else, etc.  One of the managers (owners?) came by and chatted and made sure all was well.  He asked if it was our first time at the restaurant.  He explained some of their current promotions.  I normally would have given Juan's a 3 star rating.  However, the service and the appreciation shown for patronizing Juan's figured in my upping the review to 4 stars.  I appreciate when businesses give good service and are glad that you stopped there given all the choices we have in this city.  I am a fan!",

The outdoor patio is fantastic to hang out in during the cool and warm months. Be careful because the second you sit down food is being delivered.   Before ordering, Juan's gives you a delicious basket of chips, salsas, fried peppers, onions and a killer bowl of Mexican soup. Try not to stuff your face with them because the items on the menu are deeeeeeelightful.   I have been here a few times and ate burritos and tacos, which are amazing, but the last time visited I ordered the flaming fajitas. Can you say NOM? I can!  The meal was lit on fire at our table just before serving which makes the dish really fun. It tasted wonderful too.   Throughout my meal I was happy to see little flaming flashes out of the corner of my eye of others who ordered their fajitas. It's like a flaming party up in there!  Juan's has a fun happy hour too. The drinks are great, the service is great and who doesn't like their food lit on fire? I know I do!  Go here. Bring friends. One fajita order is plenty for two.",

This is definitely a new favorite spot for my family!",

    "text": "All the 5-star reviews got us intrigued by this place so, we gave it a shot. The parking lot was full but there were lots of empty tables when we went.  We were given a bowl of chips, salsa and refried beans. They have the usual fare: ceviche, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etcetera. Since they call themselves Flaming Fajitas, we got fajitas (and a few drinks). The service was friendly but not that efficient.   Shrimp and Beef Fajitas: You can get portions for 1 person or 2 people. Honestly, the portion for 2 was big enough for 3. You can get flour/ corn tortilla. You also get rice, guacamole, and salsa. I didn't really taste what was 5-star worthy about the food. To me, it was just ordinary and nothing different from all the fajitas I've had from other places. Ok, so they bring a cart by your table and you can watch your food go up in flames (well, not really) but that's about it. 3/5  Horchata: When I'm at a Mexican restaurant, I have to have horchata. Their version was a cross between Mexican horchata (distinct cinnamon taste and sweet) and Spanish horchata (bland). 2.5/5  Mayan Apocalypse: Amaretto, vodka, Citrus Cruzan, Midori, triple sec, sweet and sour, Southern Comfort and cranberry juice. Tasty but strong. This was the best thing I ordered. 4/5",

Between the Happy Hour, yummy chips and dips, pozole, and the margaritas, you're in for a treat. But you of course HAVE to try the fajitas! Admittedly, other items have been lackluster comparatively, but the namesake dish more than makes up for them. Service can be slow because this restaurant is always filled to the brim with patrons. I hope they expand this location, because sometimes an hour is (almost) too long to wait.",

I utilized Yelp to find places to eat during my visit and I discovered Juan's. I can't say enough good things about Juan's. The servers are SO friendly, the happy hour is great and every time I go I can't stray away from the signature fajitas that they are known for. When ordering the fajita's, before they came out, there was chips, salsa, bean dip and flash charred onions and peppers AND a little cup of soup. It's crazy all of that comes \"free\" with the order of an entree. My bf and I usually split the fajita's, but if you want leftovers - order two orders. This place also gets pretty busy for dinner and only accepts reservations with larger groups, so we try to go during off hours if we don't feel like waiting.",

My sister had a ground beef taco and her feeling was the same. I thought the sauce lacked a kick and anything that might make it really stand out.   The decor was pretty much standard and the place was a little loud.   I will say that the service was good. There was a line waiting and I was with old friends catching up. I thought the fact that we had overstayed our welcome was well-handled.   I'd say if you live in the neighborhood and need a quick meal, this is a place to go.

The waitress brought my boyfriend his beer but told me they needed to change the keg for mine. That is fine but she forgot and I had to remind her twice. My boyfriend and I shared the gringo tacos. I didn't know \"gringo\" meant flavorless ground beef with lettuce and cheese. Overall not a good experience. I felt very deceived by the overwhelming amount of good reviews on this place.

My husband ordered the huevos rancheros it was one corn tortilla heated with 2 eggs on top.  Awful!  My friend and I ordered chorizo and egg with potatoes. The chorizo and potatoes were black from being burnt!!  Rather than scramble eggs into chorizo the eggs were just separate.  It was the worst breakfast we've had!   The bloody mary was watered down.  Very disappointed,  will not be back.  The wait for our food was almost 30 minutes.",

Their service is excellent, everyone is so friendly and you get greeted at the door! Food is top notch, authentic Mexican! I've had their breakfast and dinner, even their fried ice cream is a must. It sounds funny but even their chips and dip, their soups and bean dip which were all complimentary when we went were amazing. I have nothing bad to say about this place other than I wish it were closer to Boston! Keep up the great work at Juans!",

They have carne asada fries now (A-mazing), and although not on the menu, we asked if they could make a \"California\"-style carne asada burrito for my daughter and not only did they cheerfully oblige, when it came out it was HUGE and so delicious!

There is a tortilleria inside the restaurant where they are making fresh corn and flour tortillas! Before they bring your food, you are served with a generous bowl of corn chips, salsa, refried beans and a small dish of sauteed onions and jalapenos.If you mix everything together, what a fantastic combination! Be sure to save some of this fabulous onion and pepper combo for your fajitas. I'm not a huge fan of mariachis, mostly because they're so loud and in your face. There was a solo singer, not a mariachi, with a guitar and a lovely voice. The wait staff was fantastic too. They constantly check on you and are very happy to do so. Our waiter, Omar, was kind enough to tell me about a yelp coupon for checking in. This was great food, the house was packed, the service was excellent and we'll definitely be back!!!",

I had the strawberry margarita and my husband had the jalapeno margarita. Both very good. The guacamole was made to taste. We had them add everything. My enchilada was good. Lots of cheese. My husband had the steak fajitas. The set up for it is neat. Lots of things to add to the fajitas. And the flame below the pan was cool (or hot lol) The service was amazing. Our chips were full. Drinks were filled. Everyone from hostess, bartender, server were sooooo nice. We will make the trek across town to come again.",

I recommend u go on a semi empty belly. Leave room for a full plate plus some. I only put 4 stars because my tacos were doughy crispy & that make it more difficult to chew.",

The food is amazing, we got the steak and shrimp fajitas and it was delicious. Homemade flour tortillas, you can see someone making them. The childrens plates were portioned on the heavier side but we just took it home. Everyone had a good time, we had a table of 8 and I felt like we were well taken care of.

The problem came when I noticed a bug swimming in my beer. Keep in mind, we had already signed our check and were finishing our meal. I discreetly let an employee know and a \"manager\" came to talk with us. Instead of showing any concern, she argued that it was just a cluster of bubbles. WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE THE BUBBLES? She then wanted to filter the beer through a napkin to \"test\" what it was. THE LEGS WERE STILL MOVING! All of this was in front of other customers.   In short:  - we paid for our meal - the food was good - INSPECT YOUR FOOD OR DRINK!",

Anytime I go here, the service is great, the food is excellent, and it seems like the entire staff checks on you to make sure everything is good.  Even the manager came out and greeted us and asked how everything was.  Of course, the answer was excellent!  It's one place I don't mind waiting for a seat.",

    "text": "We were meeting some friends for lunch and we asked them for ideas. They chose Juan's and I am glad they did! Located just west of the 215 on Tropicana they are easy to find. We were immediately greeted and sat in a large booth.   Within seconds our waitress arrived for our drink orders and chips, salsa, bean dip and grilled onions and peppers were delivered. The latter is a nice touch that I have not seen before. I went with the shrimp fajitas (lunch size) which comes with rice and beans and all the typical sides. Our friends ordered the queso fundido which was excellent.   When the fajitas are delivered they set them on fire (hence the name Juan's \"flaming\" fajitas). The shrimp were cooked well and came with plenty of grilled green and yellow peppers and onions. The service throughout the meal was excellent. We were always offered more chips and salsa and our drinks were filled.  The only downside for me was the guac didn't seem like it was made fresh and the cast iron skillet had a lot of oil in it making it a little greasy. Besides that it was a great lunch.",

We waited for our table for 45 minutes after they told us it was a 20 min wait. Then we waited 20 minutes after seating to order. Maybe they were understaffed? Who knows. I wished there was better ventilation in there because of the flaming fajitas and the flame is...BIG. Food was delicious though. We got the fajitas for 2. I ordered a watermelon margarita and it tasted like dirt. They muddled way too much mint and didn't add enough watermelon. It looked like a mojito but was supposed to be a margarita.",

One might think, \"Hmm fajitas - doesn't that usually mean dry chicken and stiff steak?\" (at least that's what I thought) but I've been proven wrong time and time again at Juan's. Juan's fajitas are the benchmark of fajitas. It's almost as if the meats/proteins come out slightly rare on purpose, knowing that they will be the perfect temperature in about 30 flaming seconds, or the time in which it takes to assemble your first fajita and nab a first bite.  If you like fajitas, you will LOVE this place. If you don't like fajitas, try Juan's and you will understand why fajitas exist.  (Awesome salsa and bean dip, too.)",

I'll give a 5 star review if I feel the food/service really warrants it.  Well guess what, today I'm giving a 5 star review. Several co-workers of mine recently came here and raved about the place.  So today, I decided to accompany them again and check out this place for myself.  Before you know it, there was group of 10 heading here for lunch.  When we arrived, we entered into the lobby and there was no host or hostess to greet us. However, 45 seconds later, we were welcomed by a gentleman. I said that we had a group of 10. He told me that the wait will only be a few minutes while they set up.  We didn't wait more than 4 minutes to be seated.  Immediately, a few servers came over and gave us chips/salsa and took our drink orders.  I explained that we would like separate bills and the server advised that we they cannot split 10 of us. I then asked for a compromise (5 on each bill) and he agreed. He even apologized to me when I was leaving for the inconvenience. I explained to him that I understand the policy and thanked him for splitting the bill.  Our orders were promptly taken and we were provided updates on our food by the server. Meanwhile, our server along with his help, refilled our drinks, and constantly kept our chips/salsa bowls full.  When I placed my order, I asked for french fries instead of beans and the server without problem said that he can sub the fries for the rice and beans. I was very happy that he allowed me to make the swap.  The food came very fast and it was delicious. I asked for cheese and ketchup for my fries and the ketchup was given to me 20 seconds later. Talk about efficient. These servers were right on point. I ordered the steak fajita and it was perfect.    When we finished, the server processed our payment quickly and thanked us all for coming.  I will definitely return here as a result for the great food and superb staff. I hope the owner reads this review and feels proud that he has such a great team.  Feel free to send me a private message for more details on my dining experience. Thank you.",

    "text": "We've been looking for a great Mexican restaurant since we moved from California 2 years ago. Little did we know that the best place in Vegas was right down the street from us! My favorite thing to order is the chicken fajitas. They come out and light them on fire! Then the fajitas sit atop a little candle that keeps them warm until you've finished eating. Did I mention that before your meal they give you chips, salsa, beans, AND grilled onions and peppers? And sopa de fideo? My husband is getting tired of Mexican food because I've been coming here so often. Hrs seriously the best. And the servers are always friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "I wanted to check out this place due to the high ratings and some of my friends have mentioned that they like this place a lot. As most Mexican restaurants do, they offer chips and salsa. They also offer bean dip, grilled jalapenos, and grilled onions. I really liked their bean dip and that they offer the grilled jalapenos.  We ordered the carne and carnitas fajitas for two people. It was enough for three people. It was alright but nothing spectacular that I would come back for. The service was great and attentive. The restaurant is huge with a nice patio. I would come back for their chips, bean dip, and grilled jalapenos and try something else.",
