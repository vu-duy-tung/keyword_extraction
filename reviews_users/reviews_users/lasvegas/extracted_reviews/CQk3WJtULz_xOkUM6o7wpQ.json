    "text": "The Adobo Fried Rice. Omg. So good! Well seasoned and hearty! I ate half of it there and the other half later. Just thinking about it is making me salivate. The only problem was that it took a minute for me to finally dig into it when it was delivered to my table as I sat there with no utensils. My server walked by me. I was hoping she noticed I was just sitting there staring at this delicious looking/smelling goodness that I could not eat. Nope. So I had to ask. Maybe she was too busy?   Anyway, I paired it with the red velvet pancakes. It's as amazing as everyone says it is. There were many other pancakes I wanted to try. I was actually torn between ordering the red velvet and the Orange creamsicle. Feeling like I had to make a decision, I chose the red velvet. After that, I decided I wanted to switch to the Orange creamsicle. Yes, that is annoying, but I decided I wanted to try the Orange creamsicle more. I asked if it was too late, and she straight up said \"yeah\"... Um... Ooookay then. While the red velvet was in fact tasty, I wasn't satisfied. I was filled with regret of not being able to try the Orange creamsicle.   My server was really nice, but I wish she was more accommodating about me wanting to switch my pancakes. I did enjoy my food a lot tho. Definitely obsessed with the adobo fried rice! I wanna try more of the pancakes so hopefully I'm back in the area again soon. I guess next time I'll come in with a game plan of exactly what I want.",

Lol last time I was in at this location and at another location I wasn't satisfied with Lolo's Adobo Fried rice omelette. So, I got A Veggie Garden omelette which was good but nothing to rave about. My niece got the cookie butter pancakes. Mmmmmm..... Move over red velvet, cookie butter is in the house! That was good! Next time, I'm doing just cookie butter pancakes.  Mediocre.",

    "text": "Ironically enough after eating at their location on Buffalo just yesterday, a friend asked me out to breakfast today at Babystacks at the Stephanie location. Just as much as I regretted eating there yesterday at the Buffalo location, I regretted coming to this one even more ((if that's even possible)). Upon walking in, the decor in the restaurant is very tacky. It looks like someone went into the cheesy home section at multiple Walmart and picked out sets of decorations (signs with tacky quotes like \"peace, love happiness\" and a clock with rainbow mustaches on it on the opposing wall... just to paint the picture..), none of which matching each other. The service was some of the worst I've ever had. The server with a giant red hairspray Afro came to our table maybe once the entire time. I specially asked for syrup and butter for my pancakes when I ordered them because I learned my lesson from yesterday In the fact that they don't bring you anything you need to dine. When my order came out, surprise! No butter and no syrup FOR MY PANCAKES. They're pancakes!! How can you forget that? Our server was no where to be found, shock! So after waiting 5+ minutes I had to go up to the bar area and ask someone to bring some out and by that time my pancakes were so cold that the butter wouldn't spread, *sigh*. The awful service was then followed by awful food! In my first review of the buffalo location, the tasty pancakes saved them from being a total waste of time but this time, my red velvet pancakes tasted super dry and the chocolate powder they used seemed like they got to the bottom of the barrel and sprinkled the left over crumbs on my pancakes. The sausage tasted awful, like someone literally made me microwaveable sausage. Overall the terrible flow of the restaurant, awful waiter, and terrible food was enough to make sure I NEVER come back regardless of what location it is. Safe yourself the time and go literally anywhere else.",

So close that the door blocks you in your seat when it's open. There was a near constant stream of people in and out, and a hefty whoosh of cold air along with it. Breakfast was colder quicker than it needed to be, and the cool breeze in the morning became pretty annoying by the time we left.   The pancakes were delicious and tasted like pancakes should. It was obvious they were freshly made. The breakfast scramble I had included \"crispy bacon\" according the menu - and it was! I wondered if it would really be crispy when I ordered and was happy to see it was. The avocado on my breakfast was ripe, the potatoes crispy and the egg cooked just as I ordered it.  Coffee and drinks were promptly filled and tasted freshly made.  It was a little on the noisy side, with so many people in a fairly small space.  We'll be sure and visit again - and sit in a different spot next time.",

Had the banana pancakes full stack which were amazing. Syrup is sweet but not too sweet. The full stack was gigantic and was enough to tide me over for the whole day. The place gets VERY crowded on the weekend but it's great food so that's to be expected. All the staff was very friendly and provided prompt service.

My husband and I did go to the Buffalo location and they did let us add different stuff to our Nutella crepes which was really nice cause sometimes places don't allow it or they make a huge fuss. Just the only down fall usually after 10am it's jam packed. If you've got the patience I highly recommend!!",

We ordered 2 Loco Mocos, 1 Lolo Rick Adobo, 2 Macadamia Nut Short Stacks, & 1 Banana Foster Short Stack. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING tastes like a slice of heaven. Think Sarah Michelle Gellar cooking effect in Simply Irresistible. The food puts you in a joyful trance where the taste is so amazing you cannot find the proper words. I never would have thought to smother eggs in gravy layered above beef patties and garlic rice. It was savory. Then you mix the sweetness of the banana foster pancakes. Man oh man! Life doesn't get much better. The waitress was nice. The only negative is it too a while for us to get our food. People who were seated right before us and even some afterwards not only had their food way before us but by the time we got ours they were finished. We are already making plans to return. Also they have a good selection of music flowing through the speakers. I normally do not pay attention to that but there was one song that got my attention. I am not sure of the name but it was reggae style.",

It's a small restaurant that does not take reservations, goes on a first come, first serve basis and your whole party must be there in order to be sat. Understandable. I put my name down for 5 people, the hostess told me it was a 20-25 min wait. 15 mins later, she asked if my whole party was here yet. I responded \"They're exiting the freeway right now so probably another 5 mins.\" The hostess looked at me with a disgusted expression and blatantly rolled her eyes. I know your whole party must be present to be sat, so I would have understood if she had to skip over my name. I totally get that it's one of your busier days but the level of customer service that I received from the hostess was unsatisfactory. My server was really nice and attentive so it really made up for the shitty hostess. Hopefully next time I visit, she fixes her attitude.",

    "text": "We went in on a Sunday, apparently a very busy day. We were told the wait would be 30-35 minutes. No big deal.   It was hot/stuffy in the waiting area, which is one small bench and something like 3 chairs. It was difficult to determine if people were in line to pay, put their names in, or were just waiting for seating. Additional seating for those waiting might be a good idea - like some benches or chairs outside, since there is no room inside.   They turned tables fairly quickly, so that was nice.   We were seated at the table that is right at the end of the wall separating the dining area from the waiting area. It felt a little awkward to be sitting in the seat just past the wall... but that could have just been me.   The server came by and was friendly and efficeint.   I ordered the bacon and eggs meal with garlic rice and a side of pancakes with peanut butter (not the chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes). The portions were nice - satisfying - I didn't feel like I would be overeating or having to decide which portion of the meal to take home and eventually waste (I'm weird about leftovers).   I didn't feel like the garlic rice was as spectacular as others have made it seem, and I definitely don't think adding a few pieces of onion and a little garlic is work an extra $1, but I am admittedly cheap.   I also had to ask for more syrup, as the amount they give you is maybe enough for 2 bites, not 2 pancakes.   I don't remember what the husband got, but I do know he felt it was a little pricey for the amount you received.   Ultimately, it's a decent breakfast place and I'm sure we'll be back from time to time, but at the moment it's not a \"top choice\" list.",

I like how there is a hawaiian selection on menu like loco moco and adobo!  Will definitely go back to try it again next time I have people in town visiting!",

I feel like the long wait for a table on the weekends are inevitable, so be ready to wait and make sure that your whole party is there so once the table is ready you can go party with your pancakes and eggs. The food was OK, nothing extraordinary but I do favor their pancakes AND I'm a waffle kind of girl, so it's a kindaaaaaaaaa a huge deal!   The decor is quaint and some tables are wobbly but their workers are sweet and very friendly and when you've been waiting an hour to sit down, those are the kind of people you need to be serving you. Overall good experience, and I definitely recommend their pancakes & adobo fried rice",

Great customer service, even though we waited for about 30 minutes for a table the staff made sure that we would be seated soon and even though they were super busy somehow they still had a smile on their faces. We tried the adobo fried rice, Loco moco, red velvet pancakes and their cookies n cream pancakes. The adobo fried rice was flavorful, you can taste the traditional adobo flavors and the garlic fried rice. I'm not a huge fan of red velvet BUT I'm glad I tried it, you can actually taste the red velvet flavor and it wasn't too sweet even with the cream cheese frosting on the side. The cookies n cream pancakes tastes exactly like an oreo, you will not be disappointed. The Loco moco was okay, maybe we'll try the chili one next time. If you want a filling meal away from the strip you must stop by here, they have multiple locations!",

I'd like to start by mentioning that this spot is very family friendly. Which I love. We were greeted by our server and he quickly served us our coffee.  () We had strawberry pancakes which were delicious. My daughter got buttermilk pancakes which were also super tasty. I'm personally not huge on sweet breakfasts, but I can honestly say I really enjoyed tasting their sweet treats.   I ordered the breakfast burrito and replaced the meat with refried beans. I choose the green salsa to go with my burrito, and seasoned potatoes as my side. Let me just tell you guys- the burrito exceeded my expectations. It was super delicious. The green salsa is literal perfection. Seriously, I wanted to drink it. Okay, not really- but I actually ordered another side of it so that I could put it over my seasoned potatoes.  If you order more of a savory breakfast I highly suggest ordering it with the green salsa!   The service was prompt, the staff is friendly, and the food did not disappoint. We will absolutely be back for breakfast.",

This past week when we last visited, our waiter was excellent. I'm just sorry that I didn't catch his name. Anyway, not only did he make some great suggestions and provide us with great service but he also did a wonderful job at making sure that we had everything that we needed for our daughter to be able to enjoy her dining experience as well.  He bought out extra napkins, a few spoons, water without any ice, etc.  This spot gets pretty full.  I have come in the middle of the week and on weekends.  It has always been busy and there has almost always been a short wait.  The longest that I have waited is about 15 minutes.  The menu is extensive and I'd suggest that you take a peek at it while you are waiting.  The fact that I can always upgrade my pancakes to a speciality one for such a tiny cost, I have beeb meaning to try more and more of them.  This time around I had their strawberry pancake. I know it sounds super basic and I guess you could say that it is but damn was it good!! Our eggs and bacon were cooked to perfection. Everything was so delicious. You can tell it's a real family spot.  Others dining in the restaurant are all so friendly, waving at other people's children and saying hi and what not. My daughter got a bit restless and wanted to take a lap around the restaurant, no problem. She did and waved at almost everyone there if she didn't give them all high fives or fist bumps. What can I say? She's SUPER social!  Anyway, they were all friendly and returned the gesture. Some asked her how old she was, what her name was, etc.  To me, aside from the good food and the great service, having the best customers with awesome attitudes is what makes the restaurant a real gem. See you soon!",

House made hash rocks, red velvet, buttermilk cakes fluffy, just get toppings on side to control sweetness on the specialty cakes. Service is great, with a friendly attentive wait staff and even wait times are minimal. Nice twist on breakfast, just good food.",

I had the cookie butter French toast and a short stack of orange creamsicle pancakes! Service was great! Smiles and made sure we were all set and was very efficient! We will definitely be back here for sure! The baby cakes were the best. \"They were so fluffy, I thought I was going to die!\"",

Our overall experience was good and our server was nice & checked up on us with good timing.   The reasoning for my 3.5 stars is -1 star for the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.. it wasn't very good and was more like 2 (not so crispy) chicken strips smothered in buffalo sauce & thrown on the bun.. and the lettuce they used was all chopped up so everything was falling out. The sandwich was just a let down and it basically ruined my whole meal because I was getting so frustrated with it.   BUT. We also ordered Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, which was amazing!! And we upgraded the side to the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut Pancakes, which was also good!   -0.5 star for someone who forgot our extra plates. Why ask us if we need anything else if you don't plan on coming back? I won't point out who, but prior to coming in I've read a couple of bad reviews directed toward this person already.   All in all, I would've gave the 5 stars if it wasn't for these issues..",

Portuguese sausage, corned beef, loco moco!) They even have an immense variety of special pancakes such a red velvet, cookies and cream, banana's foster, etc!   I come here with my brother and we like to get an entree order and substitute regular pancakes or potatoes with their special pancakes. If you're like me and some other out there that get rice with their meal, they have an option to sub regular white rice for Garlic rice! Such a good switch!  Overall delicious food, fast seating wait times, food comes out at a normal wait time, simple and sweet decor, nice island music feels to get your morning going, and well priced! Try it out :)",

    "text": "EHHH, I have definitely had better.   Before we left Nevada, we wanted to grab some American breakfast. My friend lives in Henderson so we decided to give this place a try 608 reviews, 4 stars, whoa. We came there around 12 PM and did not get seated until 1 PM for a part of 4 even though we were told the wait time was only 30 minutes. We noticed there were outside seating and asked if it was quicker to sit outside, the hostess stated yes but that was False. I find the way they seat their guests is extremely flawed which is why the wait is so long. Instead of sliding two tables together to make a table of 4, they would go through the list and seat those whose party is only 2. So they decided to sit all the smaller parties first after pushing a bunch of tables together before seating us. In the end, they sat us at a table that were pushed together. If you were going to do that then why did we wait for over 30 minutes to get seated AFTER you had already sat everyone else who came AFTER us? Makes no sense.   We sat down and the waiter took a bit of time to get to us. We ordered the Banana Cream Pie, Hawaiian Macadamia nut pancakes, Lola Cora's corned beef hash and eggs , loco moco, and their signature adobo fried rice, hash browns, and potatoes. I was told by our waiter that everyone seem to prefer the Lola Cora's corned beef hash and eggs but I didn't see the hype. The corned beef was not well seasoned and tasted very bland. I ordered it with garlic rice and the rice came out soggy and bland as well. I felt the need to drench it in soy sauce or add my own pepper and salt seasoning or ANYTHING because it was so bland. It came with a baby stack of original pancakes which was good. Their signature adobo fried rice was wrapped in an omelets and it came with the options of country potatoes or hash browns. The hash brown was delicious! It was crunchy and fried to perfection. The adobo fried rice itself was okay. There wasn't much texture to it. The banana cream pie was super buttery and sweet. The Hawaiian pancakes were a 3/5 since I have had better. I wish they had added bananas because it would have definitely complete the dish. The loco moco was a huge disappointment. The sausages were a little hard and as previously mentioned, the garlic rice was super soggy. The gravy sauce that came with it was good however I wish all the other components on the plate was equally as tasty.   Overall, I don't see the hype. Customer service were nice however the wait made it not worth it. Food was mediocre.",

Pancakes were very plain (I didn't order any fancy toppings) but I really like them that way. I'm kind of a purest in that sense. Stood on their own well. Service was fine. Neither good or bad.  Bad: This location felt REALLY dirty even at 8am and they had only been open an hour. Music was a hair too loud and was like a dance/hip-hop/rap mix. Kinda odd. Bathroom actually made me gag when I walked in there. I had to cover my mouth/nose with my shirt. Coffee was not good either. I have a REALLY low bar for coffee, especially at restaurants like this and this I couldn't drink. I kept sipping it hoping it would get better, but it was awful. I'm not sure how coffee can go bad, but that's kinda what it tasted like... dirty pot? Reheated from the night before? nasty water? I don't know, but I'm honestly not a coffee snob but this was really bad. I wouldn't NOT go back here (or try another location) but based on this experience it would not be my first choice.",

Over easy egg over hamburger steak, over garlic rice, topped with brown gravy.   The regular pancakes are good, the Bananas Foster pancakes were decent, the fried rice omelette was OK, and the chili loco moco was pretty good.   I'd definitely return for the LM and also the great service. Our server may have been the happiest person in Las Vegas. Loco Moco all the way!",

This is my third time visiting for breakfast and every time the food quality and the type have been consistent. From the delicious red velvet pancakes to the adobo fried rice and the Portuguese sausage everything is yummy yummy yummy~  Z is the zealous breakfast fan when I am here. The pancakes are seriously divine and picture perfect every time I've been here! The red velvet IS the most popular but that doesn't mean that the other flavors offered aren't good. Where ever your sweet palate takes you go with it! They do have daily specials which are HIGHLY recommended! Though it's not the most manicured nor most appealing on the outside place to eat, DO NOT undermine the yummy possibilities offered here!  Z is for the zZZZz's you will get, the aftermath food coma from the delicious food! The portions here are again generous like the staff and a place to go again and again.   Last BUZZ not least, parking is easy to find. Morning's are busy, so expect a 15-20 min wait to be seated. And always keep an out for their specials, cause they are definitely special and always a good idea!",

Food comes out pretty quickly, correct - even with custom options, and hot.   I continue to come here because I am obsessed with their Red Velvet Pancakes and insist on sharing them with the world, one breakfast at a time. I make it a point to take visitors here. Weekdays are much less busy, but I don't mind waiting an hour for a plate full of red velvet heaven.   I've had a number of their other breakfast options (various pancake flavors and crepes) and so far everything has been incredible. Thumbs up to a consistently tasty and delicious breakfast spot!",

(I know it could be worse)  That being said and you being warned, Babystacks is a pretty decent place to grab brunch/breakfast in Henderson!   Located in a strip mall and adjacent to Genghis Grill, their menu has typical breakfast items and has a Hawaiian flare as well with items such as spam, Portuguese sausage and Pork Adobo Fried Rice.  Now back on that Pork Adobo Fried Rice. It's the fried rice wrapped in an omelette. If that sounds amazing to you, it's because it simply is. I've ordered this twice and enjoyed it everytime. It comes with a side of mac salad and your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. You can also sub the sides for an order of pancakes (some may include an extra fee)!  The red velvet pancakes were ok imo. Mine kind of fell apart on me when I tried to cut them and their tastiness was because of the cream cheese syrup.  My one gripe about this place is the early closing time.  2pm everyday?? (3pm on Saturday/Sundays) But still.. I love having breakfast foods throughout the day so that's the bleh part for me.",

My problem was the staff. Our waiter was slow with relatively no personality. I must say even though we waited longer than I would expect (there werent that many customers)the food was warm when we were served. Again, no complaints with the food. When we FINALLY got our check, we went up to the cashier but nobody ever came out to help us. We left the money including a tip at the register along with the bill and left. What was irritating was that as were were getting in our luxury vehicle parked in front of the entrance, a waiter who didnt even serve us ran out and accused us of dining and dashing!!! I told him that we left our PAID BILL AT THE REGISTER SINCE THERE WAS NOBODY AT THE REGISTER TO PAY. Who does that? Perhaps you should look before you make accusations. A large part of why I become a regular at any establishment is the for the way I am treated. It is True that their food was enjoyable but their customer service and hospitality were a flat zero. I will not return.",

    "text": "Typically I love Babystacks, but today was very lacking.  I was in the mood for something Hawaiian and breakfast at the same time, so they were the closest thing.  I'm a sucker for Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, which is what I ordered. I was taken aback when they don't allow for substitutes, so I ordered on the side kalua pig and cabbage... never felt so \"nickel and dimed\" when I saw the charge for kalua pig and the cabbage separated haha. I get it since I can sell sides and enhancements for dishes but wow.  Knowing what I know now, they sauteed the cabbage which when I poured over my rice, I definitely saw all the oil run off the plate. I was hungry so I didn't want to waste that almost $4 upcharge. So for future referrence, if I ever want to get my Portuguese Sausage fix, any Egg Works location at least provides a full link cut in half, not slices off of 1 link that looks like they are trying to stretch out. And to get my kalua pork fix I'll stick to ISG because for a couple dollars extra, I would get double the rice and about 3x the amount of Kalua pork with actual braised cabbage and not quickly sauteed on the flat top.  As for their pancakes, I've had better in their other locations. Even though I ordered the PB and ??? as my side for the breakfast instead of toast, it still came out very dense. Not their usual fluffy pancakes in the past.  Also, I didn't appreciate my server \"Nicole\" - I found her name on my ticket - giving me the check a couple bites in to the meal. Also didn't care for the pancakes coming out late. I would prefer to have everything served all at once. I get it if that's what their manager expects out of them, but by dropping the check, what I feared would happen did happen: She never checked on me again. I had to flag down the guy that was their busser who was polishing silverware in front of me to get me more water. She even came back from break and still didn't check on me afterwards.  And another thing,  I get not everyone is accostumed to foodies taking pictures of their food. But be more conscientious of your surroundings. You can laugh at them in the back service area, not in front where customers can see your busser and the male server with the very big afro style haircut snickering at the two ladies taking pictures of the food that was sitting next to me at the counter. Common sense not to do it where other guests can see you pointing and snickering at them. Do the polite thing and talk \"shite\" about guests where they are out of eye and earshot. Just like in the movie \"Waiting.\"  And yes,  I lied to my cashier when she asked me how everything went and I said okay. I didn't want to run the risk of being late and I for sure didn't want to bog her down with the points I just pointed out above.",

I was expected these fancy pancakes but got the normal buttermilk pancakes with toppings. The service was subpar I sat without a drink and silverware for a while. I actually got up and got the silverware from another table.  Overall the food was just ok normal breakfast food. The lunch food looked like it would be good maybe next time.",

Even vending machines can do a much better job. No microfoam (or just any foam) but large bubbles which after few seconds vanished. The taste was bland and the texture was too liquidy (didn't seem they used whole milk but possibly fat free or something else less creamy). My friend tasted it too and agreed with me. I just took a sip and didn't touch it again. I didn't bother to complain since this bad experience made me upset but instead went to a coffee place to revindicate my day.",

But there were still a few tables open and the counter was completely open. This is where I sat. By the time I was done the place was packed. The tables were full and my newly vacated seat was the only one at the counter. People were waiting in the entry for tables. I beat the crowd today for sure.  Babystacks has an extensive menu. One whole side is nothing but pancakes and omlettes of a varied nature. The other side has sandwiches, burgers and other entrees. This is where I looked for a meal.  There were a lot of choices that looked intriguing but I chose loco moco with garlic rice and fried potatoes. There is something disgustingly pleasing about a hamburger patty with egg and gravy over rice. I asked for my eggs to be cooked sunny side up. I'm not always a big egg eater but when that yolk and gravy gets down into the rice, oh baby, its good. Get a bite of everything on one fork and watch out. Its a flavor bomb. Add in Babystack's perfectly seasoned and browned fried potatoes and you have a starch packed breakfast for the ages.  Service was fairly effecient given how busy Babystacks was this morning. It was not overly attentive service but my food and iced tea came out quickly and I didn't have to wait more than maybe a minute to get my check after I finsihed eating. I had a good and filling meal for a fair price.",

My first bite was horrible, it had a spoiled taste and smell to it, I started checking the other pieces and they were all SLIMY!  I decided to call and complain I spoke with Clarissa (Manager) and I told her the situation she said she couldn't do anything for me until she spoke with the Owner..like, do you not have that power to refund or exchange my meal, as manager I'd imagine you would. She called me back after speaking with the owner and they decided that they couldn't do anything for me. Not even an apology. She advised that I email the owner and wait to see what happens..fuck, I dont even know where I found the time to write this, they expect me to email back and forth with this owner for something worth $12.95 for. Waste my time and money going here today. I AM VERY DISATISFIED! as a repeated customer for years.

    "text": "First time at this location and it was such an awful experience I won't return to any of their others.   Arrived Sunday around 1PM was told 25 min wait so I put my name down and told the girl I'd be back in 20. I returned in 15 mins and she notified me my name was called I'd have to start the wait again (WHAT). So we waited another 12 mins and finally get seated. We placed our orders after being seated and waiting another seven mins. Our food took 23 mins meanwhile I see our waiter standing near a shelf enjoying his lunch. Once our food does get there (delivered by someone other than our waiter as he was busy snacking) it's all wrong. We had a cold omelette missing avacado, a side of pancakes that was half there. We were told the order is for two pancakes but only one of them is done I'll get the other one soon (it never arrived). Not to mention the one pancake arrived 11 mins after the rest of the food. We then get the bill go pay at the front. This might be more annoying than everything else mentioned, I signed the check for $40 even but I get a receipt for $42. I tell the girl and she says, \"oh uhm I can void if you'd like\". I said well yes I'm not tipping what you think I should tip after the experience we had and she says ok and voids then re does the transaction.   Not only was the wait forever, girls at front counter were crabby, food was incorrect & cold but then they try to pull a fast one and have me tip more than I opted for. No thank you, I loved the centennial hills location but this experience has ruined babystacks for me. Never again.",

    "text": "A tiny place to the west of Sunset Station Casino,   off Stephanie Ave. In Henderson, NV.  It is sharing a parking lot with Burlington Coat Factory.   I really needed a map to find this place as I had passed the area a 100 times and didn't' know it was there ...the building is not facing out onto the road so if you are not looking for it, you will pass it.  At 1:30 p.m. (they close at 2 p.m.) there was one waitress, running around for the other 10 customers....she was sprinting from table to table and finally got to us...I should have lowered the checkered flag, because that's how fast she was running...    I ordered Loco Moco a scrambled Spam, with Rice and added carrot cake pancakes, my guest ordered banana foster pancakes.  My eggs and rice were ok, they needed something else, because they were so dry, I got a side of Pico de Gallo.  The pancakes were good, not fluffy but not raw, either, so just right.  Cream cheese  frosting was the syrup.  I could see little carrots in the pancakes.  The Banana Foster Pancakes were very sweet, not my thing, but the guest loved them.  Tasted like a little rum flavoring and lots of sugar and cinnamon were added.  I'm a pumpkin or buckwheat pancake, kinda person and they weren't on the menu.  If you like sweet, gooey pancakes, this is the place...they had some interesting Hawaiian breakfast selections, too.   But I'm looking for the perfect plain, buckwheat or pumpkin pancakes.",

The bacon was a bit over cooked but nothing to deter me.  I will certainly continue to recommend babystacks as a great breakfast place.",

This is a TMI moment so feel free to skip the next few sentences. The aftermath after eating red velvet, you seriously think you are dying. It take a couple days for the red dye to leave your body.  The rest of the food is ok. It's nothing spectacular but it is nice to have something other than Ihop or dennys. The staff is very friendly but don't come here if you are in a hurry. It takes a bit to order and get your food.  On a plus if you are military they give a 10% discount.",

We arrived on Memorial Day and it was not busy. We were seated quickly and I decided to finally order the adobo omelet I've had my eye on for a while. The rice was flavorful, but just a little on the dry side. I would have probably preferred if it was just the rice and skipped the egg, but I enjoyed it.   I also ordered the red, white and blue pancakes that were on special for the day. Topped with blueberries, strawberries and whipped cream, I wish I had gone with my first instinct and asked that they forego the white chocolate chips. The pancakes would've been better without them. The pancakes were good, but like the other locations, they are small and not very fluffy. They did taste good, however.  We had a good meal and I got to spend time with some of my favorite people, so that's a plus. It's a good addition to this location and I see them being successful here.",

    "text": "Hubby and I first dined here some months ago.  The food was fine but I was put off by our food arriving in stages instead of all at the same time.  My entree came without the toast.  After 5 minutes  or so my husband's meal came, without the toast.  We had ordered a short stack of pancakes to share, and those came some time later.  Our toast came after we had finished everything else.   Since the food was good, even though the service was not, we decided to try it again yesterday.  We each ordered egg entrees and a short stack of pancakes to share.  When we ordered, we specifically asked our waitress to bring out all the food at the same time.  She agreed.  While we waited I noticed the couple at a neighboring table going through the same thing we had experienced on our previous visit....the woman had her food and the man didn't.  After a long wait, our egg entrees were delivered.  We had to ask for butter and jelly, which was finally brought to our table halfway through the meal.  Our pancakes did not arrive.  Our waitress said she would bring them \"shortly.\"  We waited and waited.  We finished our egg entrees, still no pancakes.  Finally the manager stopped by and announced that the pancakes had not been prepared yet but we should \" be patient.\"  Really?  How long does it take for a pancake restaurant to make pancakes?  The manager did not offer to take the pancakes off the bill or compensate us in any way.  As soon as we decided to leave, the (cold) pancakes were delivered to our table.  There are too many places to eat in this city to waste your time here, spend your money where the service is better and your business is appreciated.",

Wish they took reservations or possibly putting our name on the waiting list as we drive there. Oh well. Guess that's how they make their money.

I've been to Babystacks three times now, and consistently they have had service issues to where all the food, particularly pancakes and toast, is not served until after we have finished our meal or even forgotten ... The joy of pancakes is eating them in combination with the savory taste of eggs and bacon ... We had lemon ricotta and blue berry and there were only 2 blue berries in the small stack. The restaurant has some work to do in terms of their food processes during busy mornings to ensure the dining experience is not frustrating.",

I ended up getting the country bene with the addition spam and the gravy on the side and an order of the mac salad.  The eggs where poached nicely which is hard to find a good place to cook them right.  The sausages patties where pretty flavor full along with the biscuit that they place it on.  I am glad i asked for the gravy on the side since that needed some flavor same goes for the mac salad.  Needed some more acid in the mayo mixture.  Overall it was a decent meal for the price.  I was shocked that it was cash only with a little sign tapped to the counter near the register, Good thing i had cash on me.  Service was good food was hot.  Like i said before i will give this place another try maybe for lunch.",

They first sat us down at a table that wasn't clean,  we then ordered our food and it took them 45 minutes to bring out my friends meal, she ordered  the banana foster pancakes, (their were just two of us eating) and forgot about mine. I ordered the eggs Benedict with spinach and mushrooms and the eggs poached hard with a sided of Portuguese sausage. 10 minutes after my friend receiving her meal, they brought out mine. The eggs were running which I specifically told the waitress that they needed to be poached hard and she also forgot the sausage. When she initially came out with my food she placed it on the table and ran off, so I wasn't able to correct it immediately and she then disappeared for an additional 10 minutes. I had to flag down another associate to get them to come down to my table and then tell them about how my meal wasn't done right. They said they would get my waitress, so again I waited an additional 5-8 minutes till she came around and I explained how they messed up on my meal and she wanted to argue with me about what I ordered. She said, \" You know the eggs are running for the eggs Benedict.\" I told her \"I know that but I don't eat them that way, \"and she said \"she well that's the way the normal do it.\" I understand that, but as a customer, I'm not asking for much at all about them poaching my eggs longer so they are over hard. After that she grabbed my plate and I told her I was done and that I'm not going to wait another hour to eat my meal when they brought out my friends early so she already ate and it was done along with her forgetting the sausage. The long and the short of this is that the meal was mediocre, the service was horrible, and I don't recommend this location.",

    "text": "Babystacks is located across the street from Sprouts and I noticed the now open sign a few weeks ago. I love breakfast joints, and though there are several awesome diners in Henderson, the idea of a breakfast spot specializing in pancakes was appealing. I finally got to try it out this morning.   All I have to say is BEST PANCAKES. EVER. Seriously. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes and my fiancee ordered the carrot cake. The carrot cake pancakes actually had pieces of fresh carrot in the batter, and both plates tasted like moist cake in pancake form. Both were also served with cream cheese syrup, which was amazing. I usually don't order pancakes for breakfast, partially because I hate store bought syrups. Babystacks makes all syrups in house and all batter is freshly made.   I know some people in the reviews complained about the portion size, but I was actually grateful that the portions were reasonable. I got a short stack of pancakes, and as much as I loved them, I personally couldn't have finished my plate if the pancakes had been ginormous. I hate food waste and appreciate when food is high quality and a normal portion size, not crappy quality in giant quantities. For me, I left pleasantly full, not overstuffed and sick.   I also thought the food was a good value. For two plates of pancakes, a side of bacon and coffee, our check was under $20. Again, I'm not really sure why some people are complaining about the food being overpriced.   There are a lot of breakfast places in town, but Babystacks has done a great job of setting themselves apart with a gourmet pancake menu. I will definitely be back to try more menu items.",

They seemed well staffed for it, although it did take our food a long time to come considering we had a couple eggs a piece, bacon, and pancakes (no steaks, omelettes, or anything too taxing).  Everything was very decent: not amazing, but certainly not terrible. It was plenty good enough, although maybe not up to the rave reviews I'd heard from other friends about the place. My hash browns though; those were awful. I specifically ordered them burnt. Not crispy - burnt. I do that everywhere I go in the hopes of actually getting crispy hash browns. The ones I got were soggy, limp, way too thick, and a bit sickly looking. I would have sent them back if we hadn't already waited so long for our food that we were ready to eat and get on with our day.   Overall, the food and the service was decent. I would go back with no hesitation if someone I was with wanted to, but it probably won't be my recommendation for breakfast anytime soon.",

We have basically made our way around every skillet in the menu with the Huntington or the HM1 being our top choices. Keep in mind to arrive early and plan on waiting to get a table. Just know that it's well worth the wait :)",

    "text": "Stacks and stacks of stacks. Delicious!   We met some friends here to try out their breakfast.  I had read it gets quite busy on the weekend so I avoided that.  We were seated immediately and didn't know how I was going to make the choice from an extensive pancake list.  Luckily my husband and I split one of the pancake choices and one of the omelettes.   Our choice was the Cinnabun pancakes and the Mexican omelette.  The Cinnabun pancakes is a sure winner.  You can't go wrong when you combine cinnamon, sugar and pecans.  Plus the full stack is huge and was glad we shared! The Mexican omelette was good and almost too spicy for me.  Their hot jalapenos and marinated carnitas were a great combo for sure.  It was good but would probably try a different option next time.    Service was good and very friendly.  Our group had a great breakfast here and would be happy to come back.",

Just the right amount of tangy to adobo.  Kids has red velvet regular stack that they shared.  It was way too much, definitely gonna get a short stack next time.  They also had Kalua pork grilled cheese and Portuguese Sausage sliders with fried and mac salad.  Kalua was great, not too salty which tends to happen sometimes.  Didn't realize the sliders was and omelet in buns.  But is was also really good.  And Mac salad was just like home (Hawai'i).  Husband had the Chili Moco which was also delicious but he said it should have had more chili.    Service was great!  We were greeted and offered drinks as ion as we got to the table and they refilled water and coffee often.  We'll definitely be back.",

With island staples of Loko Moko and various Kalua Pig dishes on the menu, this little hole in the wall brings tasty Hawaiian dishes with a brunch twist. They also offer \"normal American breakfast items\" on their menu, but definitely try the Hawaiian fare!  Seemingly the weekends are busy, so be prepared to wait. The actual place is relatively small, so that also contributed to the wait time. My personal wait ended up being around 30 minutes but well worth it. The service was on point, and the time it took for the food to arrive after being seated was waaayyy shorter than the actual wait to be seated.   I will be sure to stop by again when I am hungover and leaving Nevada. Mahalo Babystacks Cafe!",

    "text": "YAY a BabyStacks in Henderson!!!!     I enjoyed BabyStacks with my PIC a few years ago when we did a Vegas trip. When I came back, I told my Mom and baby sis, you have to come here! I didn't know they had one in Henderson until my mother told me they had one when they moved out there themselves. They're anti Vegas so this was perfect and even more perfect that they're only a mile from my moms house.    I have no clue how I was able to be alive for this breakfast since I woke up at 3am and drove to Henderson with my girlfriends and never took a nap LOL. But my hunger was soooooooo strong, it overcame the sleep deprivation HAHA.  Surprisingly I wasn't even hangry especially walking up and seeing the crowd of people waiting. No biggie, put my name on the list and we sat on the bench at a neighboring eatery. I will say, for the most part, the service folks out here are really nice because, while we were waiting a staffer from the other restaurant greeted us even though we weren't there for them . We thought we were going to get the boot lol. So we get called and the guy asked if it were ok to eat in the patio. No problem with that and that was for the best because being a party of 2, you're seated earlier and inside is cramp for my taste so my mom and I actually had privacy to eat like pigs if we wanted :D The service here is great and they keep it together even with the crazy breakfast crowd. I don't recall our servers name but she was one of the sweetest servers ever and did so well with a party with 7 kids!!!!     Ok now for the food. You have A LOT of options , so if you can't find something, something is wrong with you.  I didn't want to go overboard like I did when I came to the other location with my PIC. So I kept it simple with a straight forward breakfast. This came with sausage, hash browns topped with pepperjack , scrambled eggs and two naked pancakes with a side of butter and syrup. My mom ordered egg whites, cheddar hashbrowns, toast and Portuguese sausage . It was a nice out and we only waited a few minutes for our food. Food comes out fresh and hot. Looks great! We dig in and everything tastes so good!!!! The pancakes were good but Snooze am in San diego is number one for me in the simple pancake category :) I'll still eat their pancakes all day! Their sausage patties are my favorite kind, nice sharp taste of fennel and so juicy mmmmmmm.  My mom LOVED her food, it was solid.     We didn't go fancy schamancy like most people do when they come here, all those pancakes loaded with rich toppings and or heavier breakfast items. We wanted simple and we got that and thensome. So good and hit the spot.  We left more than satisfied and I went home and took a nice loooooong nap :D  I'd come back to their small chain everytime I'm in the 702 :D",

With GF in tow, together (but in separate vehicles) we battled time, traffic and distance to return to the kingdom of Hendo.  After dropping of my V-8 lama, I hopped into the Irish Pixie for one of the most serious conversations one can have...............\"Where do you want to eat?\"  Yelp makes the these kinds of decisions easy, because after a quick search we narrowed it down to two places.  After determining the capacity of our stomachs, Babystacks Cafe (BC) seemed the better option.  I must admit there was some trepidation on my part regarding this decision.  Normally, a visit to a BC can be an exercise in patience.  Not so!  On this day!!  We arrived early enough that a seat for two was quickly had!!!  I ordered up scrambled eggs with Spam and some garlic rice ($1.00 extra).  I could not help myself and so...I ordered a side of Orange Creamsicle pancakes.    While waiting for the meal, I enjoyed great conversation and and always full cup of coffee.  When the meal arrived with happy service, I was happy. I was even happier when I requested Sriracha and it was given.  Everything was (on this morning) what I have come to know of the BC experience minus the lines.",

    "text": "Yup!  Already planning my next visit and I've told about 12 people how amazing Babystacks is!   I came here with my sister and nephew for a Friday morning breakfast.  There was a pretty large group of people waiting but we were seated quickly and things just got better from there.   I wish I could have eaten everything on the menu.  Like really, everything.  I kept seeing what other diners had on their plates and I wanted that.  And that.  And that.  And that.   I opted for the lemon ricotta pancakes, a solid choice for sure.  Sweet but tangy, with a light dusting of powdered sugar.  They came with this cream cheese frosting/syrup but I left that out.  To me, they were perfect with some butter and the powdered sugar.  I got a side of the sausage pattys and they were stellar.  Maybe the best sausage pattys I've ever had.  They almost had a garlicy taste to them.  Sounds strange, I'm aware.  Just trust me on this one! My sister had a 2 egg breakfast and also proceeded to make a pig of herself (I love her) by ordering a short stack of the pb&j pancakes.  Out of this world good.  They tasted like dessert.  She couldn't finish them but I aint too proud to say I helped her out and we polished them off.  Yum. The little guy got a kid's breakfast and it was a complete hit.  Eggs, potatoes, sausage and pancakes.  He loved it and also appreciated the crayons and picture to color while waiting for his food.   We spent a conservative amount of just over $30 for all three of us.  It was well worth it.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean.  The only drawback is it's size; it's so small!  I wish they'd expand to a larger location but again, the wait wasn't long so it's not a deal breaker by any stretch.  I imagine the weekends are chaotic here so I'd recommend going on a weekday to avoid a long wait.  They do have a small counter that seats about 5 or 6 people so that's an option if you're a solo diner or don't want to wait for a table. There's so much to try here and I'm anxious to check all the options off my Babystacks bucket list.  It's a thing now - swear.  Just go and you'll see why!",

    "text": "Oh man, where to begin on this glorious place? I came here for the first time with my boyfriends mom for a girls breakfast. Honestly speaking, I usually don't go out for breakfast. I am always down for brunch (hello, Mimosas!) but breakfast places sans mimosas have never really been on my radar. After coming here once, screw the mimosas. Give me ALL the Portuguese sausage and eggs in the world!! I came on a Saturday morning around 10 am and there was a wait. The inside of the restaurant is small, so that's to be expected. They do make the most of their square footage though and fit as many people as they can inside. We waited about 20 minutes, but it was a beautiful day so I didn't mind. There is a Specials board inside where I saw lemon poppyseed pancakes on the menu, as well as a Portuguese sausage fried rice omelette. We ended up ordering both of these things and my mind was blown. Unlike the normal American breakfast spot, these pancakes were human sized. I could actually eat a stack of pancakes without a problem. The flavor was so delicious I didn't even need to add a dab of syrup. The omelette on the other hand was bigger than my head. I'm glad I had  company to split it with, but it was the best damn omelette of my life. I'm not usually an omelette person because I have had plenty of dried out bland eggs in my day. Well - that is nowhere to be found here. The egg portion of the omelette was so thin it was the perfect \"wrapper\" (for a lack of a better term) for the contents of the omelette. When I cut into the omelette the fried rice and sausage poured out. All of the flavors blended together perfectly. I don't know why I hadn't thought to make a fried rice omelette before. Usually there is scrambled egg in fried rice, so stuffing it into am omelette is by no means a stretch. Despite being busy, the service was very quick. The staff were welcoming and kind. Even with it being a small crowded place I could easily have a conversation with my guest.  All in all, I will be back to eat my way through the pancake menu. Even without mimosas, this place gets a 5 star rating. If they added mimosas, I'd probably never leave.",

    "text": "Ok, wow!  Yum!    This is a solid breakfast spot with a very large selection of flavored pancakes.  At first, I was a little skeptical because the menu is so large but the pancakes alone were fluffy and extremely tasty.    I love the fact that they have a lot of flavor profiles that I crave from my childhood.  I'm Filipina and I love the fact that they serve garlic rice here.  I also was telling my friend this story about how in high school there was a special class that sold breakfasts of fried rice omelets and Portuguese sausage and I would be so excited when my class was able to go.  Looks like I have a place like that I can go to now as an adult.  While nothing is too groundbreaking, I think the flavors and quality of food are solid.  We went on a Monday morning and it was actually quite busy but our server was attentive and we got both food, drinks and the check very quickly.",

    "text": "Happy to have had a chance to try this local favorite! It's been years since I've been to Vegas and one of the things my LA friends kept saying is to get the adobo fried rice omelet. From the looks of it, it was a huge portion and I shared it with my petite aunt and cousin with a side of shortstack hazelnut pancakes. It was perfect for us because the Nevada heat doesn't make me too hungry and I certainly didn't want to carry it home to LA.  The egg was cooked fluffy and wrapped around the whole serving of chicken adobo fried rice. The pancakes were light and velvety. My other cousins ordered spam and Portuguese sausage moco locos and I tried it. Also very delicious.  Because it was popular and we came during a hula competition weekend, the wait was 40 mins. I am not sure how it is on other weekends but that is the only thing that I would keep in mind.",

We both got the chilli loco moco. My friends that came here said to get the CHILI loco moco, not the regular one and to add GARLIC RICE. Definitely garlic rice was a life changer. My boyfriend loved it too. I love garlic and rice so it was the best thing in the world. I loved the chili loco moco because it wasn't salty at all. Everything was on point and amazing!  The only thing why I gave it a 4 star was because, the first bite my boyfriend had, he found a piece of hair. Which is totally normal in the restaurant industry. We told our server and he was very apologetic about it. The server took it to the back and made a whole new one for my boyfriend. Our server was very nice about this, because he even gave us a little discount for the inconvenience!   I was too full to get any of the pancakes, but they do look amazing! I would definitely come back here again to try their pancakes.",

I didn't  want to overwhelm myself with too much food. So my sis got  a skillet dish and I got my pancakes.  Talk about pancakes so fluffy and full  of flavor. You don't  need syrup. To add syrup would have ruined the banana  cream experience!  My sis skillet dish was a chili omelet yes you read that right. An omelet  with chili in it plus hash browns. Nothing short of amazing!  Service was very polite here and the waiter was very attentive. Great place to go when you want a nice comforting breakfast!",

I cant wait to go back to try more flavors.  I had buttermilk while my boyfriend had cookies and cream.  These are no ordinary flavored pancakes.  Not only do they prepare speciality pancakes, but they have specialty whipped creams and syrups for them.  Delicious!  Additionally I had a breakfast skillet which was fresh and delicious.  You could really taste the freshness in the potatoes and vegetables.  The eggs were cooked well.  You cant always find a short order cook who can prepare eggs over medium, unfortunately but well done here!  My brother had an amazing burrito!  Cant wait to go back!  Also, the coffee is delicious!  Apparently the owners prepare their own brew and their recipe is great.  I couldnt get the staff to elaborate on the blend but I find it has tones of Hazelnut.",

I'll have the Hazelnut pancakes with a Nutella drizzle, whipped cream, hazelnut chunks and cocoa-powder and the S'mores pancakes, with marshmallows, and graham cracker chunks and because I need to battle all this sugar with some salt, so I can raise my blood pressure at the same time. I'll get the Chili covered Loco Moco.   The things mentioned above are all real menu items that this crazy place serves and guess what it's all-amazing! I'm not into sweets, but I couldn't stop eating both of these pancake platters. My favorite had to be the hazelnut pancakes; no syrup needed just a healthy coating of Nutella and whipped cream. Food boner level is currently at eleven.   The Chili Loco Moco. Now if you're not familiar with Loco Moco, this is classic Hawaiian comfort food dish; white rice, burgers and brown gravy. Now let's get unhealthy and add some chili to the mix. This is not by any means a refined dish, but when hung-over on a Sunday at 12:30pm I couldn't care less. I could have used a little more chili, but beyond that a great dish!   The service here is amazing and food is stellar for what it is, \"Hawaiian Comfort Food\". Please Babystacks Cafe, update the decor. I'm definitely over seeing strip mall decor in all of these strip mall eateries.",

Once we were finally seated we watched people who were seated after us get their drinks and orders taken before we were even greeted by our waitress. They're struggling to keep up with the volume they have, and service is sub par.  My $10 bacon and egg plate had over cooked bacon and I could have gotten a better plate at a local casino for $1.49.

Also, the waiter was a bit lethargic and nelgected to bring me the coffee I ordered till a I called him over 15 mintues later.   As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the short Buttermilk pancakes and I had the Honey French Toast. The food was alright but the price was bit much for the French Toast ($8.50 for two slices of bread with no sides).   Not exactly the place to be for a returned visit, as we will look to other places to try next. If you love breakfast foods of high cailber, try Squeeze In over by Easter and Pebble instead.",

Orders were taken briskly, with no compromise on service. Customer service is absolutely excellent, taste equally pleasing. Portions left a little to be desired, but considering the price and me leaving feeling comfortable, overall my expectations were met. Filipino and Hawaiian cuisine that's very pleasurable.",

I can't speak for weekends, but it was pretty busy on Monday at around 12:30-1 PM. They clear fast, though, so it's worth the small wait. The customer service is splendid! I ordered a Loco Moco (which is really delicious) and the eggs weren't cooked right, so they very courteously remade it for me. :D I also ordered German Chocolate pancakes, which has a carmel-y coconut glaze with pecan pieces. The food is a bit indulgent, so if you really want to try the signature dishes, go on cheat day. The interior is homey and very cute, and the environment is very much \"breakfast-place\". The price is all right, definitely a better alternative to IHOP, if you're looking for a ballpark price range.",

The staff is cordial and frequently checks in on you to see if you need anything. My server JoAnn did a wonderful job, happy to add this place to my regular eateries.

The guy at the front refused to seat me until my husband was physically standing next to me. He ignored me and sat 3 other parties while I had to go out and tell my husband to come in. By then I was so angry that I told him I didn't want to eat there. My husband asked for the \"manager\" who was totally oblivious to their \"policy\" that all people in the party must be present to be seated. My husband explained that he was there outside, and that it wasn't like I showed up by myself and would have to wait 10 minutes for him. You're saying that if people are waiting outside they can't be seated? What a load of garbage considering that place is the size of a small box. The \"manager\" just glossed over saying, \"I'm sorry to hear that, was there anything else I can do?\" On repeat while staring off into space. My husband asked for his boss (which I'm assuming is the actual manager) who also sort of admitted that wasn't their actual policy and would need to talk to the staff about it. She offered to seat us, but I certainly would never spend my money there again. Sad situation to lose good paying customers for bad business practice. We never once got an apology for the way we were treated. I've been there before, but I'll spend my money elsewhere going forward.",

Especially when the menu says peanut butter. I know I'm being nit-picky but to me there's a huge difference. The food was okay - potatoes came out first, heavily seasoned and my pancakes came out dry, 10 min after. Pancakes were tasty but really dry. In the past I ordered a skillet which was really small and lacking in quantity of ingredients. The service is friendly but really slow... The host takes forever to get you seated and to settle your payment. When it's one thing after the other everything just starts to annoy you and that's the point I got to. I hadn't been here in a while and I remember why now.",

    "text": "I've been here 3 times now - once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once for a team lunch with work. I think the service is very lackluster. My most recent visit was for an early lunch. Our server brought us the water we asked for right away, but didn't come back for another 15 minutes to take our order!   I asked for egg whites overhard, and he responded, \"So you want them scrambled?\" I explained what I meant by overhard (strange that they don't know this). About 15 minutes later both meals came out, but without my eggs. He said they'd be out \"in a little while\". When he finally came over with them, they were scrambled and he asked, \"Is this OK? I know you said you didn't want them scrambled.\" So he basically handed me exactly what I said I didn't want, and asked if it was OK. That was annoying.   Everything here is an add on. Egg whites, upgrade to fruit, upgrade to a flavored pancake, etc. I spent more here on just 2 eggs, a side of bananas and dry wheat toast than I do on a much bigger and more diverse breakfast (that includes a piece of coffee cake) at Cracked Egg.   When I came for a work lunch, the wait staff made a big deal about splitting all the checks, which seemed ridiculous. We are clearly a large party that wants to pay separately, but they were saying they could only do a maximum of a certain number of checks, which I thought was silly.   Good food, and some of their specialty pancakes are to die for, but service isn't flexible and prices are steep. This place is always busy. I'll avoid.",

Our server Efrain was awesome! He was knowledgeable on the menu. When we asked for suggestions and which pancakes he personally liked, he was able to tell us without hesitation.   My BF ordered the garlic fried rice, eggs and sausage & Peanut butter pancakes. He took one bite from his garlic rice and didn't like it. He also thought his pancakes were too dry. I got the fried rice adobo omelette and the hazelnut pancakes. The adobo fried rice would be so good if they cut half the salt. It was soooo salty, I could barely eat it. The pancakes...okay so, the pancake itself without all the toppings we're okay. I was hoping to have more of that hazelnut flavor within the pancake which I didn't. When you add back the toppings, it added more of the hazelnut taste. It was okay for me. Meh  I don't think I'll be returning.

The bacon was not crispy at all even though it specifies that it is on the menu.  It was only slightly cooked but I was (currently still am) hungover so I couldn't bare to wait any longer and decided just to go for it. It wasn't great and the potatoes were barely cooked. I'm a fan of crispy everything so this place was really just meh. The banana foster pancakes were good but I still prefer other breakfast spots to this one. I gave it 3 stars because they have great service and it was fine. I just expect more out of brunch. I'm a brunch snob.  Whatever.",

    "text": "When it's busy, and they put your name on the list, watch like a hawk. Maybe photograph your name on the list. Waited the half hour we were told the wait would be... then had the same guy that wrote my name down, ask for my name to put it on the list; because it was. Not. There. Are you freaking kidding me?  We have gone to Babystacks twice now, both times had a fair wait before, which we expected. What was not expected, was what I mentioned above. We walked in, were in a line of people getting their names on \"The List\" of people waiting for a table. The younger guy asked if we wanted a table, of course we did, so we said so. He asked how many, and for a name. We told him \"2 - Chris\" - His reply, \"Ok, it should be 25-30 minutes,\" Said while he wrote down my name.  Half hour later, we're sitting on the bench waiting patiently, he walks up, clipboard in hand, and again asks us, \"Did you want a table? I have to put your name on the list.\"   Blank stares.  Yes, we would like a table, that's why WE GAVE YOU OUR NAME HALF HOUR AGO. He glances at the list, said we weren't on it, so we would have to go to the bottom of the list. His co-worker sensed our instant, growing anger, and said we would get the next table. Thank you, ma'am!  A couple moments later, we were seated with menus.   It took a little while, but our server, the same lady as our first visit, walked past, said hello and she would be right with us. Six back and forth trips later, she dropped off some water, and eventually stopped by to see if we wanted more than water, and to take our order.   Now, I have been known to be hyper-logical in the past, so when reading the menu, I had a question and asked the server, who, one would think, would have at least an attempt at a satisfactory reply.  My observation / question was thus: Order of Biscuits & Gravy: $6.50 Order of B&G with 2 eggs: $7.50 Order of B&G with sausage: $8.50  Order of B&G with 2 eggs AND sausage: $10.50  Why is it four dollars more to get both items, when individually, there is only a three dollar increase in price?  Her response? \"It might be a glitch in the menu or the computer.\"  What?!  I instead, went with another item, and tried their chicken fried steak and eggs, with hash browns, for $11.95. When the food arrived, it was a small serving of hash browns, a standard, frozen/fried CFS, and some watery fried eggs (not sure if it was water, they were very wet, and not from grease/butter/oil - or the standard egg goo).  Either the gravy, or the CFS was rather... floury. Most likely the gravy. Which, by the way, was not the best gravy around. I've had better (at Carl's Jr no less), and I have had much worse (pretty much everywhere).  For twelve bucks, I would have liked to feel full after the meal, or at least, satisfied. It was mediocre food overall.   I may go back and try the pancakes themselves, when I am in the mood for pancakes. Otherwise, there are tastier, more inexpensive places to get a good breakfast in the morning.",

I've been here twice: Once to order a take out and the other time I ate here with my wife. The red velvet and banana cakes were really good; very rich, sweet, and filling. The adobo fried rice was one of the best I've tasted. It wasn't too salty or greasy like some other versions i've tasted. The corned beef hash and eggs were simple and good but not worth the price.

I've tried several of the fancy pancakes and liked all that I've tasted (red velvet, carrot cake, bacon, cinnabun, original, cookies and cream, and so on). My favorite is to upgrade to the banana foster short stack for \"dessert\" after my eggs. My husband is over the moon for the adobo fried rice omelet that is bursting with flavor and big enough to share.

That is, until my Mom found a short and curly in her pancake.  We arrived around 1pm and it was not busy.  We were lucky to find no wait and were immediately seated.  Although it was not busy, it took our server about 15 minutes to approach us.  Although we were ready to order food, she only took our drink orders.  Once we eventually placed our food order my Mom even commented \"I can only imagine how long our food will take after that.\"  Yikes.  Luckily, our food did not take near as long.  My Mom ordered the senior breakfast with sausage links, eggs over easy and a short stack.  This is a decent deal and was far too much food for her. She actually gave the eggs and hashbrowns to me.  I ordered the banana cream pie pancakes, which were really delicious.  The short stack is plenty filling.  I loved the sliced bananas, whipped cream and banana cream sauce topping.  Other than the slow service, everything was great....until my Mom discovered a hair (that didn't belong to either of us) in her pancakes.  We were both almost done with our meals and immediately lost our appetites.  We immediately cashed out.  I would normally inform the manager of the hair, but we were in a hurry and hadn't expected breakfast to take as long as it did.  I know this happens from time to time.....I would still go back, and will update my review accordingly after that.",

Plus, I have non-Hawaiian friends who have enjoyed this restaurant so I had high expectations.   My friend and I arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday and were pleased to be seated right away, despite a nearly full restaurant!  The service was attentive, although the server did make some strange comments and seemed absent-minded at times.  However, the server was extremely accommodating and felt comfortable providing recommendations to us, which was helpful.  I ordered the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - a favorite from back home - without the cabbage.  Being a huge Eggs Benny fan, I was disappointed to find the English muffin was rather soggy. The rest of the Benny was scrumptious!  I wanted a side order of the adobo fried rice, but when the server told me that wasn't possible, he recommended the garlic rice. I did not enjoy the garlic rice at all - it was just rice soaked in oil, butter, and garlic.  I'm a fan of garlic, but it was very bland.  My favorite part of the meal was the red velvet pancakes!  It is not as sweet as you would expect and is much lighter than actual cake.  The cream cheese sauce topping was also perfect!  All in all, I would probably return again in hopes the soggy English muffin was just a bad batch.  There are also other menu items that I would love to try!",

We were seated and it  took a while for us to decide so I think our waiter forgot about us so someone else was kind enough to take our order . I ordered Lolos adobo fried rice and it was yummy . I got a side of mac and German chocolate pancakes to go . Hubby got Lola's corned beef hash and he said it was ok but he did like his Nutella pancakes . My little one got the kids breakfast with an egg , sausage and hash and an Oreo pancake which he polished off in a matter of minutes . My other boy got a 2 egg , sausage and hash brown plate with 2 bacon pancakes which took a very long time to come . I think when they made the pancakes they forgot to add the bacon so they ended up sprinkling the bacon on top . Nevertheless , he liked it . My other son got the 6 s'mores pancakes which he liked . Everything was yummy and we will definitely make this one of our stops every time we are in the area .",

Really comes too breakfast foods or a recovery meal after long day of training for triathlon. No other spot look forward to refuel. Besides the fact can get some local moco, portuguese sausage, spam, and all kine local grinds takes me back to 808. I never been too this location before use too another location closer too home on the other side of town. I was excited too hear about this new location because its closer too the Lake and the perfect spot on the way back from training can get my recovery meal in. Just so happen my review for Babystacks Cafe was for day of training but not at the Lake.  Naturally you would expect lot of similarities between all three locations. I have only been too two of the three. Coming to this location felt like everything was just as five star experience at the other location. I love the decor from the speciality board when you first walk in. One that most people forget too check out. Some days that pancakes specials make my favorite Red Velvet not sound so Ono. Make point too check it out! They have little coffee bar area so if eating by yourself perfect spot chill get your breakfast on. The tables are little tight packed so depending on the crowd feels like in on the next table conversation. Really not that bad. The service I read some review that felt like the service was slow, poor, and not very good. I got here little early but they still went ahead and sat me. Once I was seated got asked what like to drink very quickly and waitress greeted me. She was very nice since I was waiting on friend. She like take your time and no problem. The service was awesome!   I mixed it up this visit. I ordered the Huntington Omelette. I substituted egg whites always feels make any omelette better. Not normally Omelette guy but love the fact that nice size one. It packed with filling everything and the melted cheese on top with sliced of fresh avocado. You put some of that pico de gallo sauce on top brings it all together. The seasoned fries for my side delicious. It really is the prefect hearty breakfast of champions!!! One that not matter the menu selection spot on delicious!! Happy that now have one on each side of town get my Babystacks Cafe on........",

My husband and I ordered the Kalua pig benedict, red velvet pancakes and loco moco. Our waiter gave us the option of how we wanted our eggs cooked, which was different.. I thought a loco moco had sunny side up eggs but a little variety is cool.. And aren't eggs Benedict poached eggs?  I guess it would be cool if they were scrambled. Maybe. Anyway, both dishes where awesome. The red velvet pancakes and cream cheese syrup weren't too sweet so I actually enjoyed them. Next time, I'm definitely gonna hit up the Zippys Chili plate!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they weren't all that ready for their first day. They only accepted cash today because their Debit/credit card  system wasn't up and running yet. It's a good thing I had some cash. I'll definitely be back so maybe then, I'll update the review to 5 stars. :)",

Hands down, some of the most decadent substance to ever enter my mouth. With each bite I took, I wanted more and more. I was hooked. I wish I had some in or around my mouth right now. That's what she said. Ha! I can guarantee you, if you eat here, your stomach will thank me. And it's moderately priced, so your wallet will thank me too.",

Something we always get at the other babystacks location (on south durango). My pancakes had some little tiny green stuff in the batter that I don't recall ever seeing before...but I ate it anyway... The whip cream isn't as fluffy or good. It was melting. The other location's whipped cream always came out thick and fluffy and didn't melt the way it did at Stephanie's location. Maybe it just wasn't good that day, I don't know. But sucks because I always get extra whipped cream. The loco moco patty was kind of hard (too well done). The other location's is softer and more like a medium rare. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, but they would need to contain quality control. It should taste the same as if it did at the other locations.   I had a good breakfast with my boyfriend. It wasn't busy because it was at 9am but I know they get super busy as 10-11am hit. Our waitress was really nice and the place was super clean. So that's a plus. Good service. Just not up to par as the original location that I fell in love with.",

    "text": "I have traveled the world, and I have been to some great breakfast joints but, Babystacks hands down has the best pancakes I have ever had.  This is my second time at Babystacks in Henderson (near Sunset Station Casino) and I can't say enough about this place. If you are looking for an outside of the box breakfast joint, Babystacks is the place to go.   This weekend we stopped in and after much deliberation, I ordered the Cookies n' Cream pancakes off of their limited edition menu. It was one of those dining choices that left you thinking... this is going to be really good or this is going to be really bad.   Well ladies and gentlemen, when these pancakes arrived my taste-buds were doing the happy dance. I knew as soon as I saw them that I would be eating every last bite.   My half stack order of Cookies n' Cream Pancakes came with three (3) large chocolate pancakes with pieces of oreo cookies mashed up inside. I'm really not sure how they did it but the oreo pieces inside were still crunchy. Drizzled on top was vanilla cream icing and topped with homemade whipped cream (as if it couldn't get any better). And instead of topping this creation off with a cherry, they sprinkled pieces of crushed up oreo on top.   One may think the pancakes are super sweet. Surprisingly it is not overwhelmingly sweet. The chocolate pancakes must be made with a unsweetened coco, allowing you to fully enjoy the sweet icing they place on top.  It was a again, a major score at Babystacks. Next go around I will be trying out their red velvet pancakes.  If you're a local or in town visiting, you must find one of their three locations and get in to try this place. You won't be let down, I promise!",

They're known for their fluffy variety of pancakes, red velvet being their signature. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes, red velvet, and plain buttermilk. If this sounds like too much, it was and they were all short stacks! Definitely come in sharing the pancakes if you want to have your own sampler. My favorite pancakes were the chocolate chip. It didn't even need syrup because the chips had it sweetened enough for me. The red velvet cakes had its own cream cheese syrup which was pretty good. The plain buttermilk pancakes were nice and simple. They didn't have that baking powder/soda taste that I am usually able to taste whenever I eat pancakes. I also ordered the adobo fried rice which was so good and reminded me of home! The fried rice was wrapped in a blanket of egg and scallions.  Service here is excellent! Everyone is very accommodating and while I was there they offered to make and changes if there was anything wrong with the food. I can't wait to take visitors from home to try out this place!",

    "text": "Ordered the traditional eggs bendy (9.75) and red velvet pancakes (5.75)This cafe has the aloha spirit running deep in its veins, from the gregarious smiles of the staff to the Hawaiian infused menu items.    I really enjoyed my food. Riding solo at the counter I stretched my stomach by adding the pancakes after my meal. Fair enough, these flapjacks are really dessert anyways. I give full marks for my eggs benny.  Good hollandaise sauce over perfectly cooked eggs. A combo that always makes my stomach very happy. The sweet pancakes were also very delicious, coming with a cream cheese syrup and chocolate flakes. Very fluffy! Service was provided by Kaylah, and she rocked it! I was checked on numerous times and she couldn't be more friendly! At this price point I'm giving babystacks 5 stars for food and service. I believe they have 3 locations to serve u, my review applies to this location only. Mahalo babystacks!",

You will have to get there early or just know you will have to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will not regret it. Aside from that the service was very friendly. I will definitely be back over and over again. I plan to try everything on the menu. MUST TRY!!!",

Mexician breakfasts ever pancake you can imagine and eggs, potatoes, rice, any way you want it.   I had the Huevos Ranchos with the green sauce. Very good.   My wife had the Cinnabon pancakes. Said they were good and cleaned the plate.   My daughter had the Mexican skillet. Shredded pork, potatoes and cheese. 2 eggs and toast. She said the pork was perfect and finished every bit.   The server was very attentive and wanted to insure a good meal.   If the truck stop is full of trucks....it has to be good. If the local cafe is filled with locals, the same applies.   Looking for a great meal, with a fair price, here it is.",

We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in higher end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  Babystacks Cafe is a breakfast/lunch cafe offering pancakes, eggs, omelets and sandwiches.  We stopped in for breakfast.  Marginal pancakes that tasted good but that were very dry. Our omelets were nothing to write home about with obviously frozen seasoned potatos. Its hard to mess up breakfast and while these weren't \"messed up\", they just were not good.  We recently ate at another \"diner\" near by. For the same money we received an excellent meal, huge and tasty . . . very much unlike that at Babystacks Cafe.  There are too many other better choices to risk another visit.",

A lot of choices for breakfast from the very basic to some standard Hawaiian staples. Their specialty being pancakes and there are so many to choose from. You have to keep coming back to taste all the flavors. I think I counted 21 different kinds of pancakes! WOW!  We ended up ordering the sausage and egg breakfast which came with yummy potatoes and a baby stack of buttermilk pancakes. This was a lot of food and I honestly could not not finish although I did try hard. Food was very good and the pancakes were definitely the highlight. Super light, not doughy, fluffy and with the hot syrup on top they just melted in your mouth.   I will definitely return here or another location.

I had some eggs but not really impressed then I had strawberry pan cakes and I didn't finish them. My mother had Lime pan cakes and she didn't finish it either. We had a great time we went there pretty much to spend family time and that's exactly what we did. We were a group of four and no one complained about their foods but I noticed no ones finished half of their plates either lol. Service was amazing nothing to say about that, even that the place was crowded we always had our waiter asking us if we were okay or needed something but this is Las Vegas so we are so spoiled when it comes to customer service. Parking there's plenty of it. I do recommend it but i won't give 4 stars I will say: to go and have some family time is okay.",

I was never a breakfast person either, but i'm definitely more open to trying a bunch of breakfast places. Every time I come here I always get the corned beef hash with garlic rice and upgrade my pancakes to the hazelnut ones! Anything with nutella, count me in! I've yet to find the perfect time to go because there seems to always be a wait! Luckily, I haven't had to wait any longer than 15 minutes. The food is delicious! I'm taking off one star because I feel like the corned beef hash might be a little over priced. It's 10.95 before the garlic rice upgrade. I know that corned beef is usually expensive in the grocery store, but I can't confidently say it's 100% worth the price. If you're someone who enjoys fresh corned beef then I wouldn't recommend ordering this. Still good, just not the same. Just the nostalgia of growing up eating corned beef is why I will always enjoy eating it. I always had a few bites of the loco moco and the potatoes. SO GOOD. I love potatoes...so I would honestly come just for that. Nonetheless, I will definitely come back!",

We wanted pancakes but then saw there menu offered so much more like Hawaiian favorites Loco Moco. I just had to get it. The server asked if I wanted potatoes, toast or pancakes and I was amazed to hear I could choose pancakes! So I got the best of both words. Same for my son who ordered the Kalua pork grilled cheese and a side of orange creamsicle pancakes. I got the side of bananas foster pancakes.   Our server brought our entrees our first and than our pancakes. Tastes my loco moco and it was just comfort food from the start. Rice was perfect, with the right amount of gravy to mix with the egg and a nice size hamburger patty. My son bit into his grilled cheese and all I get is a smile and a giggle and yum. For him to try a grilled cheese with pork was huge and this didn't disappoint. Onto our pancakes I tried the banana foster and they were so flavorful I took a bite and I was like \"yum!\" He tried his creamsicle pancakes and he was like \"wow\" and I was like \"oh my\" and we were like \"should we ditch the Vegas buffet tomorrow and it was a \"yes!\" The orange creamsicle had cream cheese syrup not glaze syrup! You place them in your mouth and it is a flavor bomb.   So the next day I got Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice which is fried rice with marinated chicken wrapped in a egg omelet so good. The fried rice and the chicken was so good I could just order a big bowl of that on its own. Than I had the tiramisu pancakes and those were soft and creamy. These pancakes are not your typical pancake batter. Each pancake on the menu has its own batter and specialty toppings to make that flavor combination so they really know their pancakes. We definitely will be back the next time in Vegas.",

    "text": "In Vegas on business (really, I did a lot of work while I was in town) and had time before a meeting in Henderson.  I usually eat breakfast at Aloha Kitchen when I am in town, but decided I wanted to try something new.  Let me just say, I love Hawaiian breakfast.  Babystacks Cafe does not disappoint.  Their menu is full of so many choices...but in the end, I went with my go to breakfast, Loco Moco.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the rice was fluffy, the burger was well seasoned and not overcooked and the gravy was rich and thick.  In other words, it was great.  This place is pretty large, with plenty of seating, so when I went there was not a wait.  It was busy throughout the time I was there, but the service never suffered.  Parking is easy with a big lot.  Since this is about 20-minutes off of the Strip, it appeared to have mostly locals as clients, not many tourists, which I think is a plus.  If you're in town and looking for a place with tons and tons of breakfast choices, with some island flare on top, visit Babystack's.  You won't regret it!",

The second time the eggs Benedict was good but we couldn't pay our bill for 10 minutes because they were trying to get someone's to go order out and you can only pay your bill up front not at the table.  I was late for work that day breakfast took 1 hour 20 minutes.  Today i went in and sat at the counter for 10 minutes while the waiter and waitress argued about who was going to wait on me.  No one ever did even bring water or anything.  I'm a 20-30% tipper no matter what because I've been reliant on tips before so i dont know why they didn't want to wait on me.  So today I'm eating at Denny's!",

Around 0900 on Sunday August 5th, 2018 I arrived to pick up and pay for my phone order, the guy who had a heavy accent asked if I'd like some ketchup and hot sauce and I politely said yes could I please get quite a bit of ketchup since the amount of food was pretty good for the price. He put three packets which is not enough to eat with just the hash browns so I asked if I could get a few more and he then scoffed at me and put one more, I would have let it go if he didn't scoff but since he gave an attitude and was being a dick about putting a few more in the bag I said, did you only put one more? And he then decided to give the 3 I needed rolling his eyes. After he readied the bag he asked if I would like to leave him a tip which was  totally eye opening as he just gave me an attitude for a few more ketchup packets. I told him not with that type of attitude, if it wasn't for this being my only food I had to take back to work I would have just left but luckily there are other locations with that are close to where I live with better people working. Just be prepared for some attitude from that weird guy that doesn't want to do his",

Clean: everything looks clean even the floor and walls. Staff are trained and do a job without being overly friendly. Two things i change: 1) the tables outside never seem to setup or a option to use. 2) there isnt an option to get a pancake breakfast with a meat unless you want aggs and potatos as well. What if i only want pancakes and bacon? I was told to order a side of bacon for 3.95.... So instead i ordered the bacon and eggs meal which comes with pancakes and potatos for about 2 dollars less then pancakes with a side of bacon. Besides the two issues this place os great!",

    "text": "Overall a decent go to place for breakfast in Henderson. Face it, Henderson isn't one of the foodie Mecca's in Vegas. But as far as breakfast and what you get for your money it's decent.  This particular location is busy but not as packed as the other locations. You can usually walk in and be sat most weekdays and a short wait on weekends.  Service here is ok. I think once a section is seated all at once the service tends to diminish but overall decent service from decent people. There have been plenty of occasions where we were never brought items we ordered or drinks filled so be prepared.  Food wise it's a step above the chains in the area. There are some other local spots in Henderson that have an elevated menu but this isn't bad.  Pancakes are most time light and fluffy. The lemon ricotta pancakes are our favorites. Make sure to eat them as soon as you get them. Once cooled off these thin, moist decadent cakes tend to be tough. 5/5 for the ricotta pancakes.  We've tried the omelette. Nothing special. Both times the omelette has been a bit dry and not fluffy, flat actually. 2/5 here.  Biscuits and gravy tho... definitely recommend those. Hardy thick country style gravy. Add the bacon for a real treat. 4/5 for those.  Like I said, overall a step above ihop. Not a bad price point either. Expect to pay around $30 for 2 people.",

The staff are normally slammed with all of their customers so don't expect to spend too much time speaking to them. Additionally, the waiter to table ration seems to be too much since it takes forever to get the waiters attention whenever you need something. They move fast and are on the go! The bathroom was alright.. it wasn't the cleanest but not the dirtiest either. If you don't want to wait 25+ mins make sure to come early ESPECIALLY on weekends! The place isn't too big and so it fills up fast! My personal favorites are their crepes with fruit and their Filipino adobo breakfast specialties! I do think for what it is, it's a bit overpriced.. Overall, it's a great place to eat just don't expect too much from the staff and get there early!",

I ordered the BYO omlette with spinach, tomatoes, ham, and cheddar with breakfast potatoes, and the bananas foster pancakes-$9.25, plus $1.50 for the upgraded pancake choice.  The pancakes were fantastic!  Basically dessert for breakfast.  All that was missing was the table side flambe.  The omlette was good, but I would ask for less cheese next time.  After eating 1/2 the omlette and 1/2 of the pancakes, there was no room for potatoes, but were a little dry anyway.

    "text": "Best thing to get here is their pancakes. The loco moco and adobe fried rice are ok, but after awhile it's just whatever. You can get better of both items in California maybe possibly even Utah. Idk about loco moco in Utah though.   So, since I've been living in Utah for awhile my pancake comparison and palate is going to be in reference to them. The pancake here is light and moist. I'm not a fan of the dense pancake. I do like all their different options. Ive tried the lemon ricotta and banana foster. If you like a more crepe like style and more eggy type of pancake then I would get the lemon ricotta. If you want something a little sweeter, I would get the banana foster.   The next time, I come here I would just stick to the pancakes. I would leave the adobo fried rice to the filipino restaurants and hamburg steak/ loco moco to the japanese places.",

First, our server Efrain, was very pleasant, courteous, friendly and hospitable.  (Thanks Efrain!!)  Next, the menu creativity absolutely is True to the food taste.  Besides the \"menu of pancakes,\" the concept of a \"Benedict menu\" is awesome.  We decided to order the Kalua Pork Benedict plus pancakes.  She ordered the Banana Foster and I had the Carrot Cakes with cream cheese syrup.  Everything was amazing, especially the Kalua Pork Benedict.  Although we came after 10am on Saturday and waited approx 15 minutes to be seated, it was totally worth the wait.  We will certainly return again -- and maybe for lunch as the Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich sounds too good and like it would be heaven in your mouth.....",

    "text": "I remember when there was only one Babystacks Cafe, the original location near me at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Back when it opened in 2011, there were long waits on the weekends for the renowned red velvet pancakes that were served up.  People came from near and far to eat there and I became a regular customer, too.  Since then, Babystacks has opened up other locations and Henderson finally got its own in the summer of 2014.    I've been to this location a few times now and I really can't see the difference in taste or service; that's a good thing.  I have friends who live in Henderson who never went to Babystacks because it was just too far from them.  When I get together with those Henderson pals, we at least have the option to come here for some of our favorites that Babystacks is known for, including:  the red velvet pancakes as well as the Cinnabun (my favorite); Rick's Adobo Fried Rice; Portuguese Sausage and Eggs; Loco Moco.  There is still a wait on the weekends in the mornings, so be prepared; you may get hangry in the process.",

The red velvet pancakes are a given, but I really like the lemon ricotta pancakes too and they come with the same cream cheese syrup.  I'm sure this place is gonna get crowded in no time.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place seeing as I work at a breakfast/lunch restaurant as well. Our server first got our drinks and then immediately asked if we were ready to order. Seeing as we have never been here before and we'd looked at the menu for 30 seconds we obviously needed more time. He had come back 2 more times (both about less than a minute apart) before we finally figured out what we wanted. The whole time our server wasn't personable or anything. I felt like I was talking to a robot. Now onto the food... I got the honey French toast which was really good! I also loved the sausage patty. However, the hash browns were cooked only on one side. The rest was completely raw. My mom got the Cinnabon pancakes which she claimed to be good but she's had better. My sister enjoyed her s'mores pancakes, but wished it came with more syrup. I don't know if it's because they ran out of the containers to put syrup in but they came in little to go cups. They gave us the bare minimum. We would have asked for more but our server seemed in a rush to leave our table when he checked up on us. We did receive a discount, which was not explained. I'm assuming it's because he overheard us discussing the raw hash browns. Also I don't understand why there were 4 hosts standing at the front. They didn't have much to do so I think 1 would have been fine with the 15 minute wait we had.",

My favorite is the Carrot Cake pan cake with the yummy cream cheese frosting, YUMMMMM!  You can't go wrong with the Adobo pulled pork fried rice!  Generous amount of pulled pork mixed in fried rice and all of its juicy goodness, wrapped like a burrito with a thin tortilla made from a fried egg.  Warning: It is very heavy and filling!    If that doesn't tickle your fancy, the Loco Moco is pretty good!  The patty though was on the dry side, but keep in mind, I like my meat medium rare to rare.  Next time I order this I would ask them to cook it to medium.    Ambiance gives a smaller mom and pop feel to the restaurant with homey decor.    Service was excellent, checked on often enough but not intrusive :)  If you are even thinking about this place, GO! You will not be disappointed :)",

I wanted to mix my food and have something sweet and salty at the same time so he suggested my adobo fried rice and pancakes. Portioning 2/5, the adobo fried rice omelet was small, comparing it to other Hawaiian BBQ places that offer it, the size was on the small end. I was actually still hungry after my omelet but I was not going to pay another $9 for it. The price we paid was worth the quality and taste of the food but I do wish their portioning was bigger.

I forgot her name by she's the redhead who was super nice and friendly. Took our drink orders and promptly had them. Kids at Sprite and we had coffee. We both enjoyed the coffee.   We looked at the menu, decided on what we wanted and ordered.   10 or so minutes the food was served. My only complaint was that my wife's food came out a solid 10 minutes after mine and our kids. She was a trooper and told us to eat and not to worry because she would pick over our food.   I ordered the cowboy skillet. Plenty of food as it came with pancakes (or toast). The skillet was very good and the eggs were perfectly cooked (over easy.) the pancakes were delicious and perfectly cooked.   My daughter had a kids sized egg (scrambled), bacon and two sausage patties and has towns. The hash browns were just a tad oily but still very good. The sausage was amazing. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.   My son had the chicken tenders and fries. No complaints there. He ate it all up.   My wife's food finally came. She got the cowboy omelette. She said it was excellent and was only able to make it through half before she couldn't go any further.   All in all a great little place. We will def be back!",

Friendly staff on top of a welcoming environment, combined with high quality food provided an ideal first meal of the day for me.  Hashbrowns 10/10 undoubtedly my favorite part of the entire meal, they were cooked just enough so that they were crispy but not to the point where they would be burned. I ended up getting a second order because of how good they were.  S'Mores Pancakes 8/10 I enjoyed these throughly although I do wish they had provided more marshmallows with them. Nonetheless, the short stack I purchased was more than enough for me, it was cooked well and not burned, and very flavorful.

Neither of us use maple syrup, so we both asked for extra butter. It took so long I got up to remind and walked towards our waitress to remind her. The hash browns were cold and so were the pancakes. Our waitress offered to re-do the order. This time the hash browns came before the pancakes,  and were still cold. The omelet itself was good, but nothing special. The pancakes were not light and fluffy. Our waitress gave a \"military discount\" of 10% apologizing that she wasn't allowed to give more. The cashier asked how the meal was and when I told him he too was sorry. So was I - we will never go back",

I order it every time we dine in, and every other time it has been an amazing experience; on the other days not so much. Once it was salty but drinking water really helped. The other time my bread was really toasted (burnt is just too harsh a description) but our server noticed that I removed it and immediately went to the manager to see if there was any way to remove it or give us a discount. Did I mention, we didn't complain about it? Now that is great customer service! Sorry, I didn't get your name though.",

It's sad because my S.O had never been and he has this location as his first try. The customer service was terrible, as well as the quality of the food. The portions were small and cold, I requested my eggs over medium and they came to my plate runnier than a toddlers nose on a cold winter morning. Very disappointed, my banana foster pancakes had no love in them they were cold and uninviting. I am very disappointed in this location; I highly suggest the buffalo location.",

I'm giving three stars because the food was ok. There wasn't anything wrong specifically. It was just eh. I had the Huevos Rancheros with a short stack of Cinnabun pancakes. The entree was decent but tasted a bit bland. It came with hash brown which seemed to have been heated up in a microwave and seared for a couple seconds. Again, it's just my opinion but there's wasn't much about the Huevos Rancheros to rave about. The top pancake of the short stack was awesome! But because they really only drizzle with frosting the top one, the other two seemed a bit dryer.   All in all, the food was average but the service was great... enough to come back and try something else. There were plates I saw being ordered that looked fantastic. So the three stars may go up after an update.   At any rate, I would recommend this place. Your experience may differ.",

I liked the carrot cake more. The cream cheese syrup is mmm mmm delicious. -Rick's Adobo fried rice was my favorite and large enough to share between 2-3 adults. -The loco moco was too hyped up. Too much brown gravy that masked the flavor of the beef and eggs. Wait, there were eggs? All I noticed was beef patties, rice and gravy.  -The Portuguese sausage had a distinct taste however nothing to brag home about. It was also very very greasy.",

Big disappointment was the food... ordered loco moco and their hamburger patties was hard as it was just heat up from being frozen!  Second i was not aware that my sister ordered a apam and egg slider and was asking if theres pancake or rice that comes with it... waiter said no but can order it as a side order! Well my sister got a side order of rice.  When her order came in, sister was surprised to see the slider egg and spam, she said she didnt know its a small sandwuch.  Well my sister is visiting from Saudi Arabia and theres lots of food here that she didnt know.  The waiter told her after putting her slider order that the side order of rice will follow!  I got annoyed that the waiter did not even explain to my sister what a slider is... that you dont eat it with rice!   Thats very disappointing!  I cancelled the side order.  Third, my sister is visiting from outside the country and always trying to connect her phone to wifi everytime she has the chance!  She was given a password that doesnt work.  I went to the counter and the guy told me its their wifi sometimes it work sometimes not! I told him its not the wifi its the password... He seems not to care on what i said!  #neveragain #saynotobabystackshenderson",

The pancakes were pretty good.  I liked how they topped the pancakes with white chocolate chips, pretty tasty.  I wasn't too crazy about the adobo fried rice.  First of all, it didn't really taste like adobo, and second it was pretty salty.    Maybe it was just an off day on the adobo fried rice?  Hopefully, but who knows.  I'll definitely be back to try some other things, though.",

Party of two were seated almost immediately. Three seats open at bar daughter asked hostesses if we could sit at bar, she advise us she was going to offer other people waiting longer, that was fair.  About 15 minutes later three more bar seated opened hostess asked us if we wanted then we said yea after the 40 minute wait. Then same hostesses call a party of four who just walked in and sat them a table. I asked when happened to us, since we would took the bar seats and it was not clean she bypassed us. In my mind we should of been offer the table first before the bar. After I complained we got a table, no apology or anything from hostesses. Great food but getting seated it was a very negative experience. Would of been a four or five if manager or hostess said they we sorry.",

Pancakes tried: Red velvet, orange creamsicle, Easter special ( Cadbury egg batter with toasted coconut and whip cream on top), Cookie butter French toast, and sweet cream crepes. All fantastic. Red velvet pancakes are a must have! And the cookie butter French toast is the guilty pleasure of the century. Entrees tried: Spam scramble is decent. Spam sliders are delicious with Hawaiian sweet rolls layered with a spam scramble and your choice of cheese. Pick cheddar. And make sure to get furikake seasoning on EVERYTHING. It makes the dish 10x better. Kalua pig Benedict is not as good as it sounds. No flavor with a ton of carbs. If you're torn, pick the adobo fried rice omelette (substitute rice for garlic rice, add furikake seasoning) and the cookie butter French toast. Your tastebuds will thank you. It will be so good you'll come back to try the rest of the menu. Babystacks you have my heart... And my hips :')",

    "text": "I came here with some friends for brunch after a night out and I was starving! They have a lot of specialty pancake options which can be added to any of the combos as an upgrade. I stuck with the buttermilk but my friends got carrot cake and lemon meringue which they enjoyed. I also had an omelette which I didn't find to be amazing. It was a little overlooked so the edges were slightly burned and they didn't use a lot of cheese so it was on the dry side. We came on a weekday morning so it wasn't very crowded and our service was quick. Overall, a decent breakfast/brunch place.",

All were really good and fluffy. Good coffee. We also got spinach eggs benedict and spam and eggs. Waitress was very warm and welcoming. We arrived before 9am on Monday and we're seated right away.

Their menu suggests a gourmet breakfast experience with all the pancake options, but the reality of my experiences is the equivalent of a $2.99 breakfast special with a wait and a premium price.   Every time, the food is brought out piece meal, so not everyone gets their food at the same time. The eggs are always cold.   Everyone that works here is super friendly, but there are so many other options where the portions are good and the service is prompt that they can earn my business. It's breakfast, not rocket science. As much as I wish I liked it, baby stacks just isn't worth it.",

    "text": "Where do I begin? Well I woke up really hungry. Especially from dieting a whole week, so I though... \"I wanna splurge, just a little more, today!\" So I was going to go to IHOP, but my brother and his family wanted to eat. And, we ultimately decided in Babystacks.   This place was packed. I'm assuming it's because it's a new eatery and people wanted to try. We waited about 15 minutes before being seated.  I was having a hard time to decide because there was so much in the menu, which wasn't that aesthetic to the eyes. It was hard to understand the menu.   I got spam and eggs with garlic rice and pancakes. The rest of the group got the fried rice, Portuguese sausage, red velvet pancakes and steak.   I like my spam crispy and brown, this was lightly grilled and soft. The garlic rice was better than bland. It had flavor. BUT, it was still pretty bland. I could tell that there was onions and garlic powder but a little salt with the rice would have been better.   Pancakes had a unique flavor. I've had really good, fluffy, sponge-like pancakes at different restaurants, but this was pretty dense and tasteless. (I do have really good tastebuds, that's why I'm on a diet from enjoying too much food.)  I'm not sure what the other Yelpers think is so great about this adobo fried rice, but I've had Hawaiian and Filipino fried rice... And THIS, was not authentic adobo. Instead of adobo meat, it was adobo rice with shredded meat. If you're a shoyu addict, enjoy this meal. It was soaked with soy sauce. Couldn't even taste the \"adobo meat,\" which I think was a pigment of my imagination in this dish. Reconsider the adobo fried rice, and get it somewhere else.   Loco-moco's patties were flavorless, eggs were undercooked, food wasn't treated with love.  For the price of the food here, I would have gone somewhere else. If you're gonna have hawaiian-themed food, have hawaiian sized meals.   I am super sad because I had high expectations. Food is not outstanding. Service was good. Wanted more out of it. I'm going to another place for b-fast.",

I've wanted to try it on my last visit but I didn't get a chance too but on this visit it was a \"must\".  I was so glad this location had just opened no more than 2 weeks ago!  Location- Easy to find right now only one front sign but adding the second side sign. Inside decoration- Very simple gardening decorations on the walls to me it gives you a very peaceful atmosphere!  Nice clean tables/chairs and 6 counter stools.  Like most local filipino houses guess what they got hanging on the wall? The wooden fork and spoon! Hawaiian/island reggae music playing in the restaurant.  Food- I wanted to try a little bit of everything!  But I settled for these... Red velvet pancakes Kalua pork grilled cheese with fries Portuguese sausage and rice (the rice tasted like jasmine rice) not a real fan. I thought the pancakes was awesome! My favorite! Then the Portuguese sausage just topped it off! I didn't know what to expect on the grilled cheese but I must saw it won my gut! Overall- I will definitely bring more of family and friends here to try it out...Local people will always support locals no matter what.",

Not your typical breakfast at all- a twist with flavored pancakes and rice as an option for your side are some of the things that made this place memorable for me. So here's what I say is a MUST- Rick's adobo fried omelette. It was amazing. Mouth watering, and spiced to perfection. Also- the Nutella crepe. It was served at the next table and we couldn't stop staring. We regretted not ordering it. Last, the red velvet pancakes. Everyone loved them, they were fluffy and not too sweet. Other good items were the banana pancakes, garlic rice, and regular omelette. They weren't crazy delicious, just basic and good. So if you decide to go to one of the 4 locations, get the adobo omelette for sure, it's worth the wait and drive.",

I got the HM1(FMF) skillet (I don't know what that stands for), which contained seasoned ground pork, bacon, green onion, cilantro, and Swiss cheese. The price was $9.50 and the portion wasn't as big as I had hoped. The flavor was fine, but the portion fell short of what I had expected for the price and the quality of the food wasn't that spectacular enough to make up for the lack of portion.  If you're thinking about trying to place, come between lunch and dinner for a shorter wait time.

I felt almost like I was at home. I was going to order the spam and eggs, but I decided to go with the adobo omelet. It was amazing... I also had a short stack of the whites chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. Omg... I will be coming back and I will introduce more people to this place. 5 stars, hands down.",

    "text": "This place will probably have a spot in my heart forever. It's definitely my favorite breakfast spot in the area. It's a good Hawaiian/Filipino/American breakfast fusion place. The standouts, IMO, are their various flavors of pancakes and Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (which comes wrapped in an omelette). I usually get the Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup, but they have a huge variety on the menu plus whatever flavors are listed on their chalkboard for the day. I am also weirdly partial to their Loco Moco (both chili and non-chili versions) even though that's not unique to them. Their service is extremely friendly and sweet, if slow at times.   They recently stopped allowing split checks. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about dining here with friends. It's definitely enough of a nuisance that sometimes my friends and I declined not to eat here simply because of that.",

The crepe did get a little soggy by the time I went to eat it but then again I left it on the side until I was done with my skillet. I recommend ordering it at the end or eating it first. Service was good overall. The guy at the front with glasses and blonde tips was very efficient. He seemed to be seating everyone and made sure my water was always full too.",

They were pretty busy today but we got just the right amount of service.  Today's visit we tried the adobo fried rice, sausage and eggs, and of course the famous red velvet pancakes! We left very full and satisfied :)  I will be coming back for sure!",

There is a bit of an underlying Hawaiian/Filipino theme to the food and it is excellent! They make a mean Loco Moco - a Hawaiian dish of garlic rice topped with a burger patty, fried egg and gravy. It may sound strange, but trust me, it's delicious!   If you come here on a holiday or weekend be prepared for a bit of a wait. I've never been here when it wasn't packed. Also, if you come with a group be aware that they are no longer splitting checks so you'll need to bring cash or plan to Venmo the person who ends up taking care of the bill.",

The cookie butter French toast was amazing! I just wish they had a smaller version because it was so much! My boyfriend had the same as me but with cinnamon pancakes instead of cookie butter French toast. The prices were reasonable.   I highly recommend this place to everyone.

Luckily at 0900 it was just getting busy, we did not have to wait for a table, although there was a large party who was seated ahead of us.  It took quite a bit of time for our order to be taken, and then some time before our food came. My friend had coffee (refillable), eggs & bacon and Cinnabon pancakes. I had spam and eggs (no eggs, substitute for potatoes), garlic fried rice, and regular pancakes. I did try my friends pancakes and the frosting was delicious! The entire front of the menu was basically all pancakes, if you're into that, this is the place for you. The regular pancakes were ok. They were a little on the dark side, not as fluffy as I would expect. The garlic fried rice reminded me of home cooking. Spam was spam--it's always good!   Overall, if you're a pancake lover -- you have to try this place out because of the tons of diff options. I thought it was a good breakfast place. And I would definitely come back if someone invites me, but don't think this would be a top choice for me for breakfast.",

    "text": "I have been taking my family about 2-3 times a month since it opened. We loved having breakfast here at first. As time went on we had more and more issues. First of all most of the staff is not very attentive. Don't expect for them to come check on you. You have to make several attempts to wave them down.  The last time I was there I had an empty coffee cup my whole meal then 2 people asked if I wanted a refill just as I was going to ask for the tab. The next thing is the cleanliness. Tables sticky, food under our seat, and something splattered on the wall next to us as we ate that you could see from across the restaurant.  The last thing that is getting worse is organization.  The only way to pay is at the front (common at many breakfast places).   The last few times they seem to wait till the whole waiting area fills with people before they send someone over to work the register. The last time I was there I waited so long I watched my table get cleaned, sat, and the food was coming out for them as I was paying. Part of the reason was a group of about 10 women were instructed to be rung up before me by an employee even though I was in line. they then asked for their check to be split into individual checks. When I finally got to the counter to pay I asked if he was aware that I had been waiting to pay he said \"I know you waited a long time and shrugged. paid and then asked to speak to a manager. To my surprise the manager was the man that instructed the group to cut me. The food is good, but it's not worth it because of the cleanliness and the staff. Looking forward to hash house a go go opening across the street.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try this place out one sunday morning a little while back for breakfast. Fully expecting to have a wait ahead of us we decided anyway to give it a shot based on what we had heard from friends. As we arrived we saw the large crowd that was waiting to be seated yet saw an empty patio and thought \"well hell its 75 degrees out, why don't we just sit outside\". Once we were able to squeeze our way up to the hostess counter to place our name on the list and asked if outside seating were available we were told that they don't take requests. I was a little perplexed as to what that meant and was informed that they let people choose inside or outside seating once there name is called. The wait was 45 minutes which bothered me seeing an empty outside patio yet packed inside but my wife, being my calm, level headed better half told me to me just calm down and that every place we would go to would have a wait anyway so since we are here we should just tough it out. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes and not once did anyone go sit outside. Once our name was called, we asked the server if we could sit outside and we were told that the patio was closed....The dining room was pretty loud being such a small space with a lot of people and it didn't make sense as to why the patio was closed. They had more then enough staff it appeared, to equip the 4 tables outside but it was what it was. After all that we ended up sitting down and eating a decent breakfast, not terrible but nothing we couldn't have gotten elsewhere. I had the Loco Moco and my wife had the buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes I tried were good but nothing I would give 5 stars to. The service was lacking a bit in friendliness and overall I am not mad at the place for its weird seating policy or its standard food but mainly just disappointed for what transpired that morning.",

Waitress checked on us often enough to be sure we were being taken care of but not so often as to be annoying.  They have a very creative menu and you could go there four or five times and order an item not served in another restaurant.  You could also go there and get the Ham and Eggs.  Small restaurant with a very personable staff at the front desk and throughout the restaurant.  I plan to go there next time and have the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs or the Whole Wheat French Toast rolled in cereal flakes.",

I ordered the banana pancakes and my friend ordered the omelette with potatoes. I was in heaven as I was eating the pancakes. You have the option of a full order or short order. I can only handle the short order which comes in 3 pieces of pancakes. The banana pancakes was very flavorful. I was able to finish my food. I will definitely be back.

Tasty but too thick on my opinion. He said it felt like he was eating a thick cake.  When mine came, I already knew I couldn't finish it. I like my crepes light and thinner. This was thick too and I only managed to eat one and took home the rest. Maybe we are not pancake ppl but should it be so thick. I do like the decor and how the restaurant is Set up. To me that's the first thing I notice when I come in and the odor, which was fine. The food could be awesome but it will turn me away if it's not clean or inviting.

We were seated right away when I arrived, at a table next to the kitchen. We were told our server would be with us shortly but it did take him quite a while to come by. We put in our order around 11:50 and our food came out at 12:20-12:25. We paid attention to the time because we had to be back at school by 1 PM. We did not anticipate food taking that long to come out.   I ordered the cowboy omelette with a hazelnut short stack upgrade for $1.25 more. Its definitely worth it. Since we were all in a hurry to eat, I gobbled my hazelnut pancakes quickly. They weren't hot when they got to the table, but I didn't care. The flavor was spot on. Whipped cream with nutella drizzle and pieces of hazelnut made it a 5/5. The cowboy omelette comes with ham, peppers, mushrooms and cheese with a side of potatoes and according to their menu fresh red salsa. In my mind I thought it would be something like pico de gallo but it was blended (sort of like baby food) and was a weird orangeish color. The cowboy omelette was good, but was missing some veggies. Next time I'll have to add spinach and tomatoes or something.   One of my gfs ordered the chili skillet, which was potatoes topped with chili and cheese and 2 eggs. She ordered white toast with her entree and it came out burnt. You could not tell if it was white or wheat! Our server did not check in on us after our food was dropped off and he was super busy so she did not ask for new toast.   I really do love their pancakes but haven't been blown away by anything else on the menu.",

Perfect fry on the spam with just a slight crunch and the eggs were scrambled just right. My daughters white chocolate chip macadamia pancakes were heavenly as she said. This is highly recommended if your in the area. Must go again",

I really wonder why there are so many 5 stars reviews   My friends and I went there at 7:30 in the morning, was hoping to get some decent breakfast, however we end up leaving mad....  The food we ordered is pretty standard, a omelette with pancakes, sausage and egg breakfast with pancakes, and a Mexican style breakfast with pancakes.  First off, their pancakes are so dry, unbelievably taste like the instant mix you can buy in markets.  My sausage and egg breakfast and omelette plate comes with 1-2 slices of OLD oranges.... what the hell was that supposed to be ???!!! I lost my appetite just looking at that. The orange slice is broken, thin and looks Destroyed!  Their seasoned potatoes are sooooo dry, make me wonder if they precooked all of them and microwaved before serving.  Their hash browns are half cooked.... only the TOP side is grilled and crunchy, the bottom half is COLD, cold hash browns ?! Really ?!  My friend had Mexican breakfast and asked for more sauce (they gave us a small tasting cup portion), they brought more without saying anything. later on we found an extra charge on our bill!!!! Is that how you do business ?  well, in that case, why don't you charge me when you refill my water, or when I ask for extra napkins too?  If it's at extra charge, you need to notify your customer beforehand! Plus, portion was so small it's super overcharged.   All in all, they don't care for their customers, just money.... and their food are aweful with I nstant-food taste and texture, especially pancakes are horrible!!!   Go at your own risk!  I wish I went to Denny's instead. Worst way I've spend my $40.",

    "text": "My wife and I have driven by this place a few times and finally got a chance to go this morning.   You go here for pancakes. That's their signature. I wasn't feeling sweet today, but if you go here and don't get pancakes you're missing out. So naturally I got the sweetest pancakes I could find. The cinnamon pancake were delicious. The crispy pecans on top were a solid touch. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were all standard. The hasbrowns we're really bland.  The place is pretty small, but they turn out food quick. I'm not sure why the wait is quoted as so long, because the food came out really really fast. The service from the hostess was awful. She was young and she may have been new, but it wasn't good. She stared at us instead of greeting us, no smile. I finally broke the awkwardness and asked, \"table for two?\" She looked around, back at us, around again, and said, \"I don't know.... would you be ok with sitting out side?\" We said sure and she responded, \"Once you go outside you can't come back in.\" Which I get what she was saying, but there is 100% a better way to phrase that in a less off-putting way. It took our waitress almost 10 minutes to check on us outside and take our drink orders. Pretty sure she forgot about us at first. The coffee cups are tiny. Maybe 6 Oz coffee cups which she couldn't refill fast enough.   The pancakes were good, but the service was just ok. There are so many great breakfast places within 5 miles of Babystacks that those small differences keep it from standing out. I wouldn't mind going back, but if someone asked me where to get breakfast I don't know if this place would come to mind. Unless, they specifically request creative pancakes.",

    "text": "My friend and I meet up here almost every other week. It's better than \"fine\" but never rises to \"great\".  A-OK describes it well - hence the 3-star rating.  Long waits at peak times. Prices are high for what they serve. Service is hit-or-miss. I *SERIOUSLY* dislike having to wait in line to pay my bill at the cashier - after having already waited in a long line to get in.  The pancake portions are VERY LARGE and tend to be very very sweet. Lots of heavy syrups and whipped topping. I'm a big guy, and have never gotten through an entire serving, mainly because they're just too much of a sugar-bomb.  As an alternative, I've taken to ordering the Sweet Cream Crepe with fresh bananas and strawberries - with the \"cream\" on the side. It's pricey for what it is (a thin pancake with a bit of cut fruit) but I like it better than walking out feeling over-stuffed and sugared out.  The Hawaiian food looks great! I'm not a big meat-eater, so I wish they'd offer a vegetarian-friendly take on the Loco Moco. I know it's not traditional, but it would probably sell.",

The pancakes are kind of dry (kind of, not anything big, but it's worth to point out) But they're nice & fluffy!!! And the portions are big!   I've also had the adobo fried rice omelette. The adobo flavor isn't very strong in it, but I still like it very much. I haven't found anywhere else that makes a fried rice omelette that I liked more in Vegas yet.  Out of all three times I've dined in here, service was okayyy?? But I might be biased since pretty critical on customer service, soooo... yeah.   It usually takes a while to get your food, but they're quick with refilling my coffee & water! Just have a nice chat with whomever you're dining with and the time will fly by.

Read the great reviews on yelp and make the little trek to Henderson to enjoy a Hawaiian style breakfast.  Portions are pretty big at this place, so definitely bring your appetites. I had the portuguese sausage with scrambled eggs and pancakes, and paid the extra to upgrade to garlic fried rice.  Hubby had the breakfast burrito with a side of pancakes. My 6 year old had a kids breakfast that included eggs, bacon, hash browns, and pancakes.    My portuguese sausage and eggs were good, but nothing too outstanding about it.  I love garlic rice and babystacks' version was good, but maybe just a slight too garlicky for my liking.  Pancakes were also yummy.  What bugged us was how the special pancakes were prepared.  Instead of ingredients being incorporated into the batter, they were just topped on top of the regular buttermilk pancakes.  My son had the chocolate chip pancakes, which were pretty much buttermilk pancakes with a handful of chocolate chips thrown on top.  My husband had the white choc macadamia nut pancakes.  Again, buttermilk pancakes with the macadamia nuts and white choc chips thrown on top.    While we did like our breakfast and everything did taste good, I'm not sure I would make the trek out here again if I was staying on the strip.",

About halfway through the skillets, our short stacks (that came with the skillets) arrived. I had the PB & chocolate chips. I split my pancakes on two separate plates & discovered my pancake on the bottom was not fully in tact & were also cold. For a place that specializes in pancakes, I don't find this acceptable.

    "text": "My son recommended this breakfast place so we went there today 8/4/19 . We sign into the waiting list around 11:20 am and I knew it was going to be a wait because there was quite a bit of people waiting. The lady taking names said the waiting time was goin be about 30 mins or less.  We waited, and waited. 30 mins later I see most people that came after us desapearing because they were getting seated. I go inside and ask if I'm getting close to get a table as I look in the list while the girl is telling me that three more people are ahead of me, I notice that above and below my name a bunch of names are crossed out. I go back to waiting some more and as people are showing up and within 3 mins, they are getting seated at this point it has passed 45 mins since the initial signed in, so I go back in and tell them that there is 3 empty tables outside, I don't care about the heat, we are all hungry and frustrated for the long wait. So I think God was tasting my patients because everything went wrong from there. We asked for water with no ice and got extra ice in it. I asked for iced coffee and I got hot coffee and the last draw was the cashier. She processed the payment and fold up the receipt and dropped it right by register, so when I extended my and to be hand out my receipt she said, there it is! Pointing at it on the counter.  I worked in customer service for 15 years and today these people got and A+ on bad customer service. The food was amazing!!! And if these girls would get customer service trying it would be even better!!!! I'm still going to give them one more try before I can recommend them.",

Trust me, not all Babystacks cafe restaurants are the same. I've had some amazing experiences in the past!! And their food is amazing! BUT, in this particular location, their staff is in serious need of customer service workshops or something. Upon arrival, no one greeted us. We were a group of 5. Waited 35 min.. people that arrived after us were seated first. There was even a group of 5 that arrived after us and they were taken right in.  After that, we asked if we were ever getting a table, the hostess responded with a \" oh it'll be a 25 min wait..\"  Please, go to the other locations, this one with their customer service alone makes me not want to go back.",

The review isn't based upon the food or service, just waiting and services in general. Maybe there could be a new waiting/reservation policy that can help people check-in beforehand or receive texts depending on waits past 45 minutes long! But overall, the menu is great and diverse. I've had many things on the menu from the pancakes, to omelettes, to the Filipino dishes-- all prepared to great tastings! I'll definitely come back for as long as it's open whenever I want to have an early catch-up breakfast or brunch with pals, as long as the wait isn't forever.",

I will definitely be back to try out their other pancake creations. For those of you who prefer a savory breakfast, they also have a huge variety of omlettes & other egg based breakfasts if you're not a pancake fan! Even their plain buttermilk pancakes are incredible. My boyfriend and I walked in & got seated right away by friendly staff & servers! Awesome awesome place!",

I spent many years in Hawaii and Guam and I've had really awesome loco moco and Portuguese sausage.   First off the hamburger patty in my loco moco was not fresh or homemade. The Patty looked too perfect and too proportionate to be fresh ground and hand made. I make my own hand made burgers patties and I know exactly what fresh ground homemade patties look and taste like. I would put my money on the fact that their hamburger patties are frozen and typical processed store bought patties. The kind that look like well proportioned hockey pucks.   Secondly, The Portuguese sausage was more like turkey sausage. It was not authentic by any means. It was dry, lacking in flavor and spice, and certainly was NOT authentic Hawaiian Portuguese sausage.  Lastly, the wait time at this place was ridiculous. Considering the quality of my food, it is not worth the long wait and I would not recommend this place to anyone expecting classic Hawaiian comfort food.   On a more positive note, their red velvet pancakes were pretty awesome. Stick to pastries and baked goods and leave the Hawaiian comfort food to the experts.",

We opted for the counter yesterday, in order to get seated faster. Even though a lot of tables were open, there was a lot of people waiting.   There was NO reason to get seated quickly. The food took about 45 to an hour to come out. Everytime I asked the waiter what was going on and where the food was, all he could say was \"It's coming\". When we were about ready to leave, I asked again \"Can you please tell me what is going on and it's coming?\" The waiter said he would go check, rather than coming back out and answering me, he hid in the kitchen for 10 mins and then finally brought SOME of our food out. By the time we got all of our food, parts of the order were wrong, waiter said he would get what I asked for & never brought it out.  Now, I overheard an excuse one of the waiters gave another table and it was \"Our regular chef isn't here.\" I do not feel that to be an appropriate excuse. There should always be back up&back up should be able to do their job too.  Let me say this, the food was still good and our meals were comped. BUT good food and horrible service with a side of comped meals.. is not enough to make a great experience like food should always be. I would rather pay and leave happy.",

Matter of fact I never eat pancakes, but when I come here I always eat their red velvet pancakes. Delicious. First off they are cooked perfectly. They are not too sweet, but if you like them sweeter you add more of the cream cheese syrup or the perfect whip cream.  The adobo fried rice is bomb. Wrapped in an egg it looks like an omelet until you cut it open and delicious fried rice with adobo is inside. It seems like most people have tried this place, but if you haven't then you must.",

Upon moving to being seated young lady in a rush to get back to the cash register to stand and look pretty cut me off....I give her the opportunity to go first because after all I am the customer. They sit us in the very back. Where the AC blows incessantly next to the hallway leading to the bathrooms. Waiter was nice. We felt out of place not being Filipino or Asian....seriously seemed like we were in a foreign country with both staff and customers....don't know why that was. Food less than acceptable. Actually my Piglet skillet was mostly cold. Wheat pancakes for my wife dry and tiny. Overall a horrible experience. Waiter was on the ball but not exceptional. Never visit again...yech",

While it may take a while to get your food out to you when they're busy, the waiters and waitresses always chat with you to make the time go by faster. They genuinely care about you as the customer which is greatly lacking in many establishments today. I ordered and shared three stacks of pancakes with a friend. We tried the red velvet, cinnamon roll/Cinnabon, and white chocolate macadamia nut. Out of the three, my favorite was the cinnamon roll. On other occasions, I've had the loco moco and the portion sizes were generous. The eggs Benedict was delicious for something that normally doesn't suit my palette. Their hazelnut crepe was very yummy and it was nice that you didn't have to order it in a group of three like normal restaurants. The hot cocoa is to die for and certainly is the best I've ever had. I will be coming back to sample more of the menu soon.",

Pancakes were good till I found a white hair in my food! Yuk! Appetite ruined! Told the waiter about the hair and he said he'll comp one of the meals but when I got the check? It was still there but oh well. I didn't want to make a big fuss out of it since we'll never go back here. Went to pay and stood there in front of the TERRIBLE host/cashier and still no acknowledgement lol so I left the money on the counter and left. TERRIBLE!!!!",

First of all parties before ours were being seated first but it wasn't until we waited 30 min for 1 of party  to get her food while we were waiting still waiting for the rest of the food to arrive.  I noticed people that were just being seated getting their meals when I finally went to front counter to ask what was going on.  I was told by the Hostess it just depends on \"how the kitchen gets the tickets.\" Is that a concern of mine or management?  I guess what really made the situation worse was the lack of care for the situation. Not even an apology after waiting almost an hour without food. Guess the fact that this place has so many customers who cares about upsetting & losing 1 customer.  Since this is not my first bad experience at this restaurant, I certainly will not be back nor will I recommend it to anyone else unless you have hours to spend waiting to be seated, to get your drink order and to finally eat.",

They have a bar top which I enjoy eating at and watching tv. Well lit and always smells good.  The menu is a great size and very easy to understand. I have only been there for breakfast. I have gotten the piglet omelet and buttermilk pancakes the times I've been there. The first time I went they were fantastic. The omelet had lots of meat and was a good thick omelet. The pancakes were decent at best (but I don't care for pancakes usually). The second time I went I order the same thing and there wasn't hardly any meat in the omelet and it was a bit runny. I took 2 bites of the pancakes. One was off the side and was hard, I moved to the middle thinking it would be softer but I was wrong. I got my check and left thinking I'd never be back. About a month later my mom wanted to go because someone had recommended it to her so I figured I'd give it another chance. This time was just like my first experience. The omelet was great and the cakes....again....decent. My mom got blueberry pancakes which I tried and wasn't really a fan of, the blueberries were really sour and just ruined the cake. I've never had bad service just bad food. I never thought the prices were unreasonable either.   I'd suggest this place for breakfast, and if it's not good, give it one more chance.  Also, I liked that they had the local zip code magazine.",

There were literally multiple green peppers cooked right in the middle of the pancakes and i had never been more confused in my life. I really wish I had taken a picture of it but I was really grossed out and called my server over right away. He took it away and brought out another one but I didn't really have an appetite for it anymore so I took it to go but it's probably just going to end up in the trash. I don't know if pieces just fell into the pancake batter or if it was a dirty pan but green peppers were the last thing I had expected to bite into. I was even more disappointed that they didn't apply any kind of discount to the bill. I'm a server as well and if something like this were to happen to one of my own customers I would definitely give a discount or at the very least, take the pancakes off the bill. Also the pancake syrup they gave my boyfriend was slimy and had a thick layer of film over it like it had been sitting out for a long time.",

We went here after spending all weekend at a volleyball tournament and really, we wanted some great food. We came straight from the tournament and rushed so we could get there before they closed at 2:00. We get there and one other guy walks in right ahead of us. From where we can see there is one table that needs the be cleared. They tell us 15 minutes because this other dude got the last table, which I get, he was there first, but seriously, we were hungry! I was getting hangry and the teenager was surly she was as so hungry. We see an older couple who look close to being done and we're like, cool, it will be less than 15 minutes. So they finally finish and we  are about the pass out from low blood sugar. The guy pays and the table sits there dirty for a good minute.  Two minutes. Three minutes.  I'm staring at the hostess who is busy with the very important task of putting ketchup packets as nearly as possible into a bin. Finally, the table is clear and I can almost taste buttermilk pancakes but she's still arranging ketchup packets!!! I stared at her again and moved my head from her to the table and she finally got a hint and seated us. As we walked to the table, we realized how big the restaurant really was and there were no fewer than SIX EMPTY TABLES behind the cash register wall. My husband and I were dumbfounded. Why did we sit there for 15 minutes? If I wasn't about to pass out from being hangry I would have said something and gone somewhere else.",

They have multiple locations but we went to the one on 550 N Stephanie St, Henderson. There hours are from 7-2p and parking is easy to find right in front.   We went around 10a and we waited for about 15 minutes. It was pretty busy. The staff is nice and once we ordered, the food came out quick. One thing, I wouldn't really say they're Hawaiian but they do have spam and portuguese sausage.   I ordered the Huevos Rancheros ($9.95) with potatoes (crunchy/green sauce). This was Ono! I really liked it a lot. The meat, beans, sauce and the crunchy tortilla complimented each other.   One thing you have to try are there short stacks. I mean there name is baby stacks lol. We had to try one and we went with the orange creamsicle short stack. This was so good. I'm not a big sweets person but this one hit the spot.   Would I come back? That's a yes! Go check them out if you're in the area.",

Anytime I ask her where she wants to go to eat breakfast, she always says, \"You wanna go to Babystacks?\" and off we go.   I'm not too much of a breakfast person, so I only order either grilled cheese, or pancakes haha! Whichever I order, I love it. They have red velvet pancakes, which are extremely delicious and sweet. A little too sweet for me, but still good.  My mom orders the senior breakfast, which is eggs made the way she likes them, hash browns, turkey bacon or sausage, toast or pancakes.  She loves her breakfast!   Staff here are very kind as well. From the minute you walk, you are greeted. To be seated, as I mentioned could take a little while, but definitely worth the wait!",

This place made me wish I could eat more and I can already eat a lot.  Luckily this was easy access from the hotel I was staying at and I could justify the eleventy-billion calories I was about to consume a couple days after the World's Toughest Mudder.  I wanted pancakes and French Toast.  Tuesday at about 7:15 in the morning the small little restaurant was pretty empty and I was greeted immediately by a very kind server.  She gave me a few minutes to decide on what I wanted which I had already planned out but with so many choices, I was still hesitant.  I opted for the Rocky Road Pancakes (Half-Stack) and the Cookie Butter French Toast...because who doesn't love Cookie Butter?  Overall the Rocky Road pancakes were really good, albeit they tasted a bit on the dry side, kind of like a brownie that had lost a little of its moisture.  Looking back, I feel like maybe I should have opted for the German Chocolate Cake Pancakes instead.  The Cookie Butter French Toast was fantastic though, and I had no problem wolfing that down.  The coffee was pretty bad though.  Not sure how that happened.  Without sweetener it tasted like dishwater.  Not sure how I know that either.  However, I overlooked that due to the pancakes, French Toast and friendliness of my server.  Babystacks is definitely on the top of my list for breakfast in the area and that's saying something considering my hotel offered free breakfast.  If I need to stay in the area again, I'll definitely be back, I'll just skip the coffee next time.",

They literally have something for everyone on their menu including the various flavors of pancakes. I usually just stick with my basic breakfast(eggs,sausage, whatever pancake I'm in the mood for).. Although I've recently discovered the Portuguese fried rice omelet and it has changed the game for me! It's been a while since I've gone to a restaurant and fell in love with something on the menu, 10/10 recommend you try it out. Makes me sad they're only open until 2-3pm because I crave it everyday now!!",

    "text": "6/18/18  My family and I arrived here at 12:30 pm on a Monday.  We have been here many times and knew this place might be busy. Our party of 10 checked in and we were willing to wait to be seated. The young lady in the front informed me that there was a whole section around the corner that was ready, but that it was closed and we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated. 20 minutes?!  Really?!  I ask her why, but she wasn't sure so I asked for the manager. A few minutes later a young man with big red hair came over. I've been here enough to know that he wasn't the main manager, but he might have been the person in charge since I know he's worked here for awhile.  I asked him why we have to wait 20 minutes when there was open seating enough for us all?  His answer was because there was only three servers, so that section was closed. I was confused at that answer because I've seen this place packed out before with only three to four servers and today, it wasn't even as busy.  Although the staff was not rude, my family and I weren't going to wait for seating when seating was available. This is VEGAS!  There are way to many places to eat here. If you want to hang on to your customer base these are the kind of thing you need to avoid.  We ended going to Hash House A Go Go were there was no waiting.",

It sucks not being able to give this place 5 stars because their pancakes are really 5 stars. Red Velvet, Cookies & Cream, s'mores, all of the ones we've tried are amazing. But their cakes are always better than their actual breakfast main entrees.   I really shouldn't be eating all this stuff anyways but HEY, who cares lol.   I'm docking them 2 stars for 2 reasons.   1) 11/19/16-The corn beef hash had no flavor. And neither did the adobo fried rice when my cousin ordered it 2 weeks ago.   2) 11/19/16-They only have one register. The cashier decided to take a to-go order and instead of writing it down then putting it in, she took up the register which created a line to pay while the person ordering on the phone took forever. Pretty inconvenient.  There are a lot of other spots in Vegas with great cakes. Doesn't have to be this one.",

The cafe is a little on the small side and that coupled with the fact of how popular this place can make getting in a bit tricky.

Honestly my quality cooking is better than Babystacks Cafe.   One thing I will never order again from here is their red velvet pancakes. Terrible it's not real velvet. It's just pancakes with red dye coloring chocolate chips on top with whip cream served with icing.   I wouldn't recommend coming here the portions are small and over priced.",

Both the summerlin and henderson location get really busy on the weekends. The service was slow, but given the crowd, we expected that. The servers were nice and friendly though.   The food was alright. I came here mostly for pancakes, as they have a huge variety of pancake flavors. I got the orange creamsicle, it was alright. While the concept of orange flavored pancake itself is unique, the pancake was just ordinary. We also got an omlette which was served with hash browns, sour cream and some pico. Again, it was good but didn't seem anything special.   Overall, the service is bit laidback, the food and vibe is like that of a chain restaurant and the waiting times can be annoying.",

If you haven't been here yet, you're definitely missing out, and probably the only person in and around the Stephanie/215 area who hasn't been. I say this because the crowd is WILD and the wait is wild, but let me tell you, it's TOTALLY worth it!  I've also decided another name for this place should be Dessert for Breakfast. Is it because I love personally love dessert for breakfast? Nope. It's honestly because a lot of the menu contains some really great sweet tooth craving options that will satisfy your taste buds!   We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table and we even went around 11 a.m. on a weekend. I've been earlier but if it counts for anything, I don't think it matters what time you arrive. This place is always a hot commodity and the lobby area is always full of people desperately awaiting their table (or even just a spot to sit in the lobby sometimes). This place desperately needs Wait List on Yelp! If any business owner is reading this, trust me! You for sure need it :)  Now on to the grub! As a personal crepe lover and lover of everything nutella, how could I not go for the nutella crepe?! I think I'm learning my eyes are larger than my stomach and that I can't eat too much of anything sweet. I opted for the single nutella crepe, but they do have them in threes if you want. The single was definitely enough for me. I got some potatoes on the side as well, which were seasoned to perfection. My husband got the cinnamon bun pancakes and a side of bacon and potatoes, too. It takes a lot to fill him up, but he said he definitely was full off of it. Again, I think the sweetness takes up a little more room in your belly if you're asking me. :)  Really love this place. Always get amazing service, too. Again, check out my pictures because if your mouth isn't watering from those nutella crepes, there might be something wrong with your eyes. We'll see you soon, Babystacks!",

I'll give you a minute to read that again.   \"Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice\" did it for me! It reminded me exactly of something my late grandma's used to make, g-d rest her sole. I have never EVER tasted anything ever again like her dish until now. I was not expecting it and it took me by surprise! This dish as Babystacks is basically like an omelette burrito, with the omelette part being the wrap and the Fried Rice being the filling. Except the fried rice is not what your thinking. It's more of of the shredded chicken then the rice. One of a kind taste, DELICIOUS.   Also had the Red Velvet Pancakes. Loved them until I tried my daughter's buttermilk pancakes and loved them EVEN MORE!! Pancakes on point.   They offered kids coloring page and crayons. Total yes.   Final note on the high chair that either could be higher or the table lower. The high chair is not tall enough so my son's head was just barely over the table.   I recommend trying Babystacks. Great for the whole family. Food was delicious and you really get that local vibe.",

    "text": "Nice spot for breakfast. Pretty much any type of pancake you want, they can make. Menu is divided into sections, pancakes, traditional breakfast and local (Hawaii) style breakfast. Spam and Portuguese sausage on the menu. My breakfast for today was the homemade corned beef hash with seasoned potatoes. Also included were traditional buttermilk pancakes (2) or you could upgrade for one of the specialty options.  Pancakes were fluffy and light. Corned beef hash and seasoned potatoes were good. Portion was a bit small but not a deal breaker.  Definitely would go back to try the savory bacon pancake with a side of Portuguese sausage.",

The pancakes with bacon was different. We thought the bacon would be in the pancake itself but they were actually presented on top of the bacon.   I thought the adobo fried rice would come with a sauce on top but it was just fried rice in the omelette. It was good, but tasted a little dry.",

My favorite is the chocolate chip pancakes for which I upgrade at every meal from the standard buttermilk.   Since it's on the smaller side for table spacing, we have often had to wait upon checking in. They do have a small bar area with open seating and a small patio area. The waits have never been extensive however and it's always been worth it!",

    "text": "So we ended up at Babystacks Cafe mainly because some family were in town and they decided that they had to try this place. It was definitely a good choice. Similar to Peg's Glorified Ham & Eggs and EggWorks this place specializes in breakfast and they do it really well.  The place is pretty easy to find and we went around 9am on a Saturday. As expected there was a wait, but it wasn't too bad considering the food quality. The inside is just like a diner and the menu was pretty extensive.  Here's what we ordered and what we thought: Red Velvet Pancakes - It was recommended by other yelpers and it was alright and what you expect. Red velvet flavor. A bit sweet but worth a try. Banana Foster - This was very tasty and sweet but not overpoweringly sweet. It has alot of bananas so if you like bananas then definitely get this. Baby Chick Omelette - This was okay, but I don't think I'd get it again. It didn't really pop in flavor. I'd get a different omelette next time. Chili Loco Moco - This thing is great if you love chili. It tasted a bit heavy but overall a good choice. Portuguese Sausage and Eggs also with Spam - It's what you expect. These were pretty standard issue so no additional flavors. Simple.  I'll definitely be looking to come back here again as the menu had alot of items I wanted to try. In the hierarchy I would say Peg's and Babystacks are definitely my go-to places. Peg's if I don't really feel like driving too far. Eggworks if I'm looking for a large amount of food, but not quite as tasty.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FyOBSn-SMERw&s=074c503825acefd4721921d816865128a5e57c0d2d5762aa587196f6250eb436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/yOBSn-SMERw</a>",

    "text": "Compared to their other location that I've tried, this place was not what I expected it to be.  It was not the same.  The quality of the food wasn't what I experienced the first time.  The food was just okay here.    I ordered the Kalbi with Eggs and upgraded the rice to Garlic Rice for a dollar more, which I don't think is worth it.  For the price of the meal in general was not worth it.  If I ordered Kalbi from another location, I would have gotten more kalbi for my buck and cheaper.  The garlic rice was mushy.  I know it said that it contained onion which I don't mind at all because I put onions in my fried rice, but I think the pieces where too big.  They really could have done a better job to make the onion taste more edible, even cooking it a bit longer would have helped.  And the portion and having to add a dollar to it didn't match.    We also upgraded our pancakes to the banana cream pie and the cream looked like it was dried onto the pancake.  Although the flavor was good, we did have to ask for more cream on the side.  Wouldn't be a \"cream pie\" if it didn't have cream right?  And it was only a drizzle of cream that came on the pancakes.    I'll give this kudos for service.  The server was kind and attentive to us.    So with that being said, Happy Eatings!  Until next time!",

With all the raving reviews, we came here and we are all SO DISAPPOINTED!   First if all, their name is babystacks, specialized in pancakes... !!!!! PANCAKE SUCKS !!!!!!!! Their pancakes are NOT fluffy, NOT tasty... they are so dry and doughy and it's almost like they served me a biscuit.... pancake tastes like store bought mixture, combined with bad cooking skills, here you go the NASTIEST PANCAKES I'VE EVER HAD....... syrups are thick without much taste and DRIES UP, thats just never heard of....  I ordered the breakfast burrito, it comes with a small cup of salsa (served in the small plastic cup, tasting cup size).  Burrito is nothing good about it, but i liked the salsa, upon asking for additional salsa i got another small cup of salsa.  When i get the check, they actually charge $0.75 for the additional salsa they gave me. Out waitress never said anything, and please don't tell me it's \"normal practice\" to charge customer salsa without telling them it would come in at additional cost!  THIS IS SUCH A JOKE.  My wife and friend have different complaints about the food they order too...   Will never come back again",

When it was time for our table we were missing 2 people, so they didn't seat us because our entire party wasn't there.  We were furious, because we were all here originally and their policy is what sent people out for cash.  After we waited 30 minutes for a table, another group of 7 walked right in and was seated right away.  They gave them our table. It was mind blowing, they did this one more time before we requested to speak with the manger.   After speaking with Larissa the manger we had a table within a few minutes.  I have to say Larissa is in the right field. She handled our disgruntled behavior like a champ and diffused the issue amazingly and quickly.   Our situation is different because we were all there and because of their policy we went and got cash so we could eat together.  Guess we should have gotten seated first and then had them leave to get cash.    Afterward we were seated Abbey was our waitress and she was awesome!! Our food came quickly and was delicious!!",

    "text": "From my two years of living in the Henderson area, Babystacks Cafe has to be my favorite breakfast spot. It is my go-to, most recommended and favorite breakfast to come back to. The staff here is always friendly and works hard to provide the best customer service.   The food here is Hawaiian-American breakfast and lunch with an awesome emphasis on pancakes. I like their menu because it's not too expansive where I get overwhelmed but has all the specialties and necessities you want. Bonus points for the place for having a Senior special which my dad loves. I have tried dishes from their pancakes, egg skillets, breakfast sliders and burritos. I never had a complaint with their food. Maybe some complaints here and there with the wait but it was still worth it. The potatoes are my absolute favorite and if my entree doesn't have potatoes as a side, I will make sure to order a side of it to make sure I get my potatoes fix. The portions are large and I always feel like I need a nap or take some home at the end. The prices are reasonable for that as well.   Because the place is relatively small, just know that you will wait anywhere from 5 mins to 40 mins, depending how busy they are. They also do take out orders if you prefer that. Highly recommend this place for the atmosphere, the service and of course, the food!",

    "text": "Man, I love Babystacks! The Summerlin location was created such a great vibe, I was really putting some big expectations on this new location. The best part: it's literally a mile away from my house! That's a score!  Just like the first location, this location is busy! On the weekends (and probably the weekdays as well) be prepared to wait! My wait wasn't bad though, just 30 minutes. There's a hostess station with some seating and lots of standing room outside. When you enter the restaurant, you'll notice lots of table top seating and some booth seating. There's big tvs for the game and some bar top seating as well. The service was awesome. Our server was such a sweet lady. She greeted us within 2 minutes and kept checking back with us. We actually got our food before the guests that sat 5 minutes before we did! Now that's efficient :)  For brunch, I got the Spam Scramble for $7.95. Three scrambled eggs with diced spam, sprinkled with furikake and a garlic rice upgrade for $1.00 more. The garlic rice was cooked with furikake, oil, garlic and onions. The flavors were awesome! I love spam and love the saltiness of it, complimenting the eggs very nicely. The rice was on point, just as I remembered. The ONLY problem with this plate was the portion. OMG, it was sooo small! It took up only 75% of the plate. I ate everything within 2 bites. I definitely think they have bigger portions in the Summerlin location. For my side, I decided to upgrade with a babystack of Red Velvet. Red velvet pancakes, topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles, served with cream cheese syrup. OH-EM-GEE, just has I remembered! The cakes were moist and so flavorful, the cream cheese really made the red velvet pop out and the chocolate crumbles accented the dish very well. DEFINITELY A MUST TRY!  I'm so glad this place opened by my place. I can literally come here every weekend without wasting a lot of gas. The next time I come, though, I hope they address this portion issue. Whether or not, I'm still coming back...time and time again!",

    "text": "I wish yelp had half stars as baby stacks is more of a 3.5 star kind of place. That's not really a knock on this business. The vibe is island style and the restaurant has a relaxing feel. The menu has a ton of pancake options but has other more traditional options like omelette says well as island flavor a like loco moco.   I had the loco moco which was very good. The patty was big and thick and juicy. It seemed to be made from scratch. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the gravy was rich and dark. I got a side of bacon pancakes. I was hoping for better cakes. Mine were flat and dense and slightly chewy. The flavor was there, but the texture was not.   My wife had the chicken fried steak and eggs with carrot cake pancakes. Her steak tasted a bit off although it was nicely fried. Maybe the oil was on its way out. She loved the sausage gravy but was nonplussed by the thick, undercooked hash browns. Her pancakes were thin and tender and had lots of spice. They tasted like carrot cake and were very good.   The service overall was good, yet our food took almost 30 minutes to arrive. The table next to us was having issues too. Maybe the kitchen was in the weeds as it was late morning on a Sunday. Our server did check on us several times and refilled our coffees constantly.   If you like a large selection of \"dessert\" pancakes then you'll probably like baby stacks. If you're more of a traditional pancakes person you may prefer a different place. If you want loco moco this is your pace!",

It's a little pricey for a breakfast place but service was good and we'll definitely keep this place as one that we'll visit regularly.",

First, if you are going to call yourself Babystacks your pancakes should be amazing.  These pancakes were like eating cardboard.  My husband ordered the plain buttermilk pancakes and I ordered the carrot cake pancakes.  His were cold and burnt.  Don't know how that happens.  I think it could be because they use frozen pancakes and then just re-heat them.  That is certainly what they taste like.  As for the omelettes, they were rubbery and the bacon in it tasted horrible.  It almost tasted like they put liquid smoke in the omelette.  We have eaten at the Babystacks in Summerlin which was terrific, so we were excited about one in Henderson.  Unfortunately it was a big disappointment.",

My husband got the Santa Fe ... It was mediocre but not too bad. The meat was dry.   As for the service... It was less than expected. I counted 6 staff members and 3 tables with customers (us being the third) no one came to our table for at least 7 mins to take our drinks. I had to call someone over. No one came to refill our coffee when requested until I had to ask for it again. We asked for butter on our toast and no one ever brought that over until, once again, we asked for it a second time. Our waiter looked like he was miserable...  The only reason why I'm writing this review is because the one other time I went to baby stacks at a different location, this was no my experience.

The pancakes were overpowered by one ingredient and the artificial flavoring was \"no bueno.\" There was a moment I regretted not getting the red velvet stack, but soon as I saw the next table cut into the bright red center, which screamed artificial flavoring, that feeling quickly left. My sis ordered the strawberry crepe, which had to be doused with strawberry and cream cheese syrups to add flavoring.   IF, I was ever brought back here, I would stick with the coffee (strong like I like it), bacon and square hash browns. Those were good and kept me from leaving the restaurant hungry.   Bottom line: The service was great, but I'm a girl who likes to save her calories and this meal wasn't worth the extra pounds on the scale.",

I like having \"breakfast\" for lunch or even for dinner, so I ordered an omelette and pancakes. The \"Piglet\" omelette contained bacon, ham, and sausage with cheddar cheese on top. Now I don't mind a little browning on my eggs, but this was way too overdone for my taste and none too fluffy. And I could say the same for the pancakes. I like my pancakes golden yellow. These were charred brown and flat as.....well, as a pancake! The hazelnut Nutella drizzled over the top and the huge scoop of whipped cream were good but somehow I missed having syrup.....maybe hazelnut syrup? At least the service was excellent. Friendly servers, always checking on you. I never give up on a restaurant after only one try, so I will go back and order something different.",

    "text": "If you've been to the original Babystacks (nee Babycakes) off of Smoke Ranch, you know there's a price to pay for amazing gourmet pancakes: the wait can be upwards to an hour. But once you're seated, the food is delish, the service is stellar, and the clientele includes a lot of cute Islander boys.  OK, maybe it's just me that noticed that.  Well, Babystacks has a new location off of Stephanie in Henderson. The food is still delish, the service is still stellar, the Islander boys are still cute...  And we walked right in. **gasp**  I went off the pancake menu (finally) and gave their omelettes a try, opting for my beloved chili omelette. They boasted Hawaiian-style chili, which was even sweeter than a Chicago or Cincinnati chili, but still really good. I added a babystack of S'Mores pancakes. If i had one complaint about the place, it's that I thought adding a babystack of pancakes would get me 2 regular-sized pancakes. Instead, they're mini-pancakes.  Boo your face. If I had known that, I would have stuck with the pancakes and tell the omelette, \"Excuse you, buster, do you know where you're at? I need pancakes and I need them right meow.\"  But I digress. That was the only downside to our experience. Elite Emily had the Adobo Fried Rice, which has been widely lauded elsewhere, and she enjoyed it, though she had the same reaction to her Red, White, and Blue babystack pancakes.  Our server was great, and she kept us refilled with a big smile. The place feels new and clean -- a good thing since it just opened.  I definitely will come back. Carrot cake pancakes, you're next on my hit list.",

I ordered an omelette, side of hash browns well done and the side of baby stack pancakes. My husband ordered eggs Benedict. My hash browns were undercooked. The omelette was very pedestrian, smallish with tiny pieces of diced meats that were indistinguishable from each other (bacon, sausage and ham). Pancakes were nothing special, actually pretty dry. Black Bear Diner is THE place to go for pancakes for sure.   My husband's eggs Benedict was way over cooked. Eggs were on the hard side, not poached and runny at all. The Hollandaise had so much lemon it, it was almost curdled. This place may only know Hawaiian food but we'll never be back to find out.  Not sure if it's crowded because people are too lazy to drive any further or if they just don't know better.",

I decided on the Ortega chile skillet, with bananas foster cakes! My meal was very tasty, warm and lo cal! Just kidding, but our food was delicious! The green chile was medium to mild, the potatoes were moist and fresh, the eggs cooked to a perfect over medium! Our pancakes were fluffy and warm, the caramel sauce and warm bananas absolutely delicious! Kudos to our server Kaylah  she was delightful, very friendly and helpful! Gomer and I highly recommend this hidden gem in Henderson! Have a great Memorial day weekend and Thank you to all who have served or currently serve our great country in the military!",

I've tried various ones and I must say  I was impressed with none and disappointed in all. They are consistent on being dry that no amount of syrup can fix.  I've also tried their biscuits and gravy. Also unimpressive. My husband has tried their country fried steak and loco moco and a few other items and also agrees this place is highly overrated.",

I realize that Hawaiian style food is their thing, but with my experience from living on the islands, this is a poor excuse for a restaurant.  After waiting for 30 min, our food was cold and tasteless. We also waited for 30 min to get our check which was $47 for just two people. And when I complained to the manager, I wasn't offered a coupon or anything, just a fake \" sorry, now pay us the $47 that we don't deserve\".  Don't ever go there !!!",

When we first arrived and went on the waiting list we noticed that there were several seats available at the counter and several tables outside that weren't being used even though there were plenty of people waiting. So we asked if we could sit at the counter or on the patio. They said no, there is a wait for those as well. This did not make sense since when they finally sat us, those counter seats and patio tables were still empty! Next, we were not happy with the food. My wife's pancakes were very undercooked as was her omelette with very runny eggs. My Baby Chick omelette was very bland and overcooked and my Hazelnut pancakes were also very dry. We did not enjoy anything here. It was also so noisy that we could hardly have a conversation. For this type of meal I would suggest going to one of their competitors. Sorry.",

It's served over oven roasted potatoes and your choice of a side (pancakes or toast).I chose sourdough and it came buttered. It was fresh, hot and delicious! I also added a single sweet cream crepe with strawberries and it was so perfect! It was served with fresh strawberries and a fresh strawberry syrup on the side. The sweet cream is a cream cheese filling that isn't too sweet, but complements the strawberries wonderfully. The other choice was bananas. Chrissy was our server and she was friendly, cheerful and a pleasure. Service is A+. My partner had buttermilk pancakes. They were fluffy, obviously homemade and fresh to order. Overall, we throughly enjoyed our breakfast and we will be back before we leave Vegas!  Disclaimer: I rarely give a five star, so this is in no way meant to discourage anyone  from dining here. I highly recommend this cafe :)",

That experience had been pretty damn amazing, so we couldn't wait for this location to open up.  And now that it is open?  It's hard to convince my wife that we don't have to eat here every single weekend.  The best selling point of this place are the various pancakes they have, almost all available in half-stacks or full-stacks.  These range from Orange Dreamsicle pancakes to Banana Cream pancakes and everything in between.  The absolute best that they have are the Cookies and Cream pancakes, which are to die for.  I'm not sure why they are on the special board and not on the permanent menu yet, but do not miss out on them.    Everything we've ever tried here has been great.  We've built our own skillets before, we've tried the Kalua pork sandwich - it's all turned out well.  The service is typically good and the wait times aren't too long, though it can get fairly busy on weekend mornings.  Seriously though.  Get yourself some cookies and cream pancakes.  You know you deserve it.",

    "text": "I have never been to any other location of Babystacks Cafe so I can not say how this one measures up to others. All I know is I LOVED the meal I had here over this past weekend.  Allison S. and I decided to have a late breakfast at Babystacks before doing a little shopping. There was a decent sized crowd of people waiting to be seated at the fairly small cafe when we arrived, but the wait was only about 25 minutes.   I was tempted by the red velvet pancakes that Babystacks is known for, but when I saw that one of the daily specials was the strawberry lemonade pancakes (which I had already dreamed about, after seeing the photo Suzy H. posted) I had to order that. I went with a short stack, and added a side of sausage, and it was more than enough food for me.   The pancakes were perfection, just the right amount of lemony tartness topped with fresh strawberries and delicious cream cheese icing, plus a huge serving of whipped cream. I have had fluffier pancakes, but the flavor profile completely made up for any lack of fluff. I stole a bite of Allison's spinach benedict and that was super yummy as well.  Service was spot on. Babystacks remained busy the entire duration of our visit, and while it was clear that our server was working hard, she was an absolute sweetheart and she always had a smile on her face. Our water and coffee cups stayed filled and our food came out fairly quickly.   Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Babystacks and look forward to returning to try some of the other items on their menu.",

And sure thing I had an upset stomach when I got home. This was the first meal of the day for us and everything else was to my satisfactory and our waiter was gladly to comp off the corner beef hash since I did not want anything else but did want to remind them it was not the same taste like always and I know what something spoiled taste like since I have worked in the food industry as well.",

Since it was a Saturday there was about a 25 minute wait, but I knew it would be worth it. When they called our name we were quickly seated. Our waitress was very on point. She never let our coffee or water glasses get empty. Babystacks menu has tons of different pancakes that they offer, but make sure you check out their white board for their daily specials. I finally decided on the Spinach Benedict with a side of their macaroni salad and Jessie picked off the white board and got the Strawberry Lemonade pancakes with a side of turkey sausage. The Spinach Benedict was excellent! It was loaded with spinach, crispy bacon, mushrooms, poached eggs and it was all covered it the best tangy hollandaise sauce I think I've ever had. It had a lemony note that was perfect. Jessie was nice enough to let me try her pancakes too. Let me tell you I'm really not a pancake person and those pancakes rocked! What a great flavor! Lemon pancakes covered in strawberries and it had a lemon syrup too!! ALL the lemon.   It was another great brunch with Jessie B. Babystacks didn't disappoint. The wait sucked, but for the amazing food and excellent service it was worth it. If your looking for a tasty breakfast/ brunch spot this is the place! Yum!",

Comfy, could seat many people. Service was very good, everyone's really nice and attentive.   This was our first visit here (Babies R Us/ shopping center), but we've been to their other location (4 total in the valley BTW). I had been looking over their menu since the real first visit, and was really wanting to try their \"local favorite\" Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice (egg burrito) and the red velvet pancakes seemed very enticing. What the hell, right? We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. Our son had his favorite, sausage links. I didn't get a hot chocolate because I knew breakfast was going to be big. And it was delicious, we split each item, our favorite thing to do.  My husband asked me if it was authentic, and it definitely was (I don't eat filipino food as much because (1) my lola was a really good cook and because of that (2) I am really picky with it. Besides, it is usually high in fat, calories & sodium, too. 5 days a week I am on a restricted diet.) The adobo flavor was perfect (not too much of one ingredient like vinegar), the twist was adding rice, and placing it all inside an egg wrapper which ends up looking like a burrito, mmm, it was hella good or masarap. Hubby liked it so much would conside getting the same, but me being curious, would like to try the loco moco.",

    "text": "Awesome breakfast spot for the area. The worst part about coming here will be trying to decide on just one menu item. Before I even ordered I knew that I'd be back again.  We arrived on Saturday morning to a packed restaurant which I expected. We were quoted a 10-15 minute wait, but didn't wait nearly that long. As soon as we were seated our waiter came by to take drink orders. Once he returned with drinks a few minutes later he offered to take our orders, but didn't rush us. Our waiter continued to return frequently refilling drinks and checking in on us. He was friendly and everyone working the morning I visited seemed jolly.   I had the French Toast Combo with Honey Toast, Bacon, and over medium eggs. Yum! The French Toast was perfectly prepared and has a nice crisp to it. The eggs were prepared more on the over easy side, but that wasn't a big deal.  The portion was perfect for me. It filled me up without feeling like I had eaten too much.  My husband had the Banana Cream Pie pancakes, a full stack. The portion was huge and he really enjoyed it. I liked the flavor of it as well. There were plenty of bananas and cream pie on top.  We'll definitely be back. I can't wait to try their Filipino breakfast option!",

The workers were absolutely sweet and accommodating. Food was great-- as if I were enjoying meal in Hawaii. Lol.  Btw, their red velvet pancakes are to die for. So fluffy and flavorful! I highly recommend ordering it.",

Great sandwich with Applewood bacon, crisp iceberg and tomatoes. I wanted to keep it lean on my side so I paid additional for fruit. It was a great selection of melon, grapes and strawberries.  The best part of my meal was the service. From the moment the gentleman greeted me at the front door and seated me. To the awesome service I got from my server Efrain. He promptly took my drink order, returned with it, and asked if I had any questions about their menu. He then took my order, served to me in a timely order and checked on me several times. That's great service.  I hope to return soon and try one of their many flavorful pancakes.",

I'm giving it one star because the waitress was nice and friendly (although once our food was delivered, she seemed to disappear).  Make sure you pay attention to the wait list as they were calling people out of order.  We asked if we could sit at the counter and were told we had to wait, but then a couple walked in a few minutes later and walked straight to the counter where they were served (even after the hostesses talked about how they were not on the list).  I ordered corn beef hash and eggs with seasoned potatoes and buttermilk pancakes.  This is my favorite breakfast, but this one ranks at the bottom of the list.  It appeared and tasted as though the hash came out of a can with some chopped onions thrown in (do not put onions in hash please).  It was very dry even with the over easy eggs mixed in (I ordered over medium). The potatoes were overcooked and flavorless.  Even with syrup poured all over them, the pancakes were extremely dry.  We will stick with New Day Cafe.",

    "text": "With all the good reviews and always seeing a line out the door when driving by, one might think this place is worth trying.  And so we did.  I'm not usually one to wait but we did since we were excited to try a new breakfast place and one with a Hawaiian twist.  Our wait time was about 30 mins but I also noticed new arrivals being seated before us?  Weird. While we waited to be seated we looked the menu over and just couldn't decide, everything looked so amazing.   I settled on 'homemade'corned beef hash with garlic fried rice, my husband had the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes. Well, while the corned beef may be homemade it tasted like the stuff we buy in the can, the fried onions with rice...I mean the garlic rice with onion, whoa!  Hours after eating that and brushing and gargling I am still breathing onions and garlic.  And when my rice has been sitting in my rice cooker for to long the grains on the side of the pot get really hard and are undesirable to eat,  there was alot of those grains in my fried rice. Now my husband's pancakes, underwhelming to say the least, just no flavor and very dry. He was very disappointed and he LOVES pancakes!  He said he'd rather stay home and make store bought mix. This restaurant is named after a stack of pancakes, so why does the syrup come in a condiment cup?  Probably won't come back, which is sad since we love breakfast and especially Hawaiian breakfast (being from Hawaii). Who knows, never say never right?  If we ever do go back and it's good I will look forward to upgrading this review.   Oh wait!  The staff is very friendly however the servers are so busy we only got checked on once and towards the end of the meal... Good thing we didn't need anything. Two stars for being friendly.",

We googled places to eat before leaving hotel and decided to try this restaurant.  We were both pleasantly surprised to find that they served Island style breakfast (I was born and raised in Hawai'i, part Hawaiian/Chinese).  Anyway I had spam/eggs with rice and sliced tomatoes instead of pancakes.  Later I found out they had macaroni salad...that would have been the perfect Island breakfast.  My husband had Portuguese sausage/eggs with rice and pancakes.  He said the pancakes were a little dense for him.  The rice was cooked perfectly.    Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and we were seated right away...had to move to another table because the sun was in my husband's face.  Will certainly consider stopping here again on another trip to Arizona.",

It just took a very long time to place our order and get the food. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedicts was not runny enough although it did have a good flavor still. We also had an omelette that needed to be remade as it didn't have any cheese in it and it was also very dry with only a couple pieces of ham. My huevos rancheros was excellent. So yea it was a little bit of an underwhelming experience just because I had high expectations based on the great reviews but I think we just caught them on an off day.

This pancake house is semi Hawaiian themed with things like Adobo Omlettes, garlic rice, and mac salad. All 3, great choices! There are also over a dozen pancake selections like red velvet, lemon ricotta, and bacon. I usually go with the seasonal specials such as strawberry lemonade, and bananas foster.  Never once have I been disappointed. Well, except for the wait time. Unless you go right when they open, or an hour before closing, expect to wait. None of the 3 locations are very big. I think they are going for that personal feel.  The service is pretty good. Not over the top amazing, but quick, decent, and friendly.  If you haven't tried Babystacks, it's worth a wait. Maybe not an hour wait, but this place is popular for a reason.",

    "text": "So we kept hearing about the this awesome location from friends and from some gals from the Las Vegas Moms Blog. So we took a chance and came, I was so happy that we finally made our way here. The menu has a very big selection on pancakes and they all look yummy. So in our first visit I tried the Red Velvet and it was sooooo good, even my picky eater was curious and he ended up taking my last stack and only left me with half a pancake, I loved the cream cheese glaze, it wasnt too sweet and it complimented the pancake, so I can see why it is there best seller. I also took a chance with the Kaluia grilled cheese sandwhich, and it was awesome. I am not a fan of sourdough but the bread and cheese complimented the pork and added good texture and flavor. So today I am trying the breakfast burrito with Kaluia pork and the bacon on  the side, and an order of cinnamon bun pancakes.  I will update this review once I taste my customized burrito and unique pancake. But so far I am really digging this place it has an american, Filipino Hawaiian twist, and it really works out, especially if the Filipino in you wants rice with your food.",

The ham is like sandwich ham and only one scoop of rice. Pancakes were a little under cooked. The worst part of the experience was the service. Everyone has bad days but I think our waiter couldn't keep up with coming back to check on taking our order, bringing us coffee refills, cleaning up a drink spill, bringing back a to go box and bringing our bill. We had to find another server to help us. Guess we have to find a new breakfast spot.",

They may want to reconsider seating guests that close. During our whole meal we were interrupted by gusts of air and people passing right next to us.  Coffee was good, refills prompt.  I had the special for the day: Mocha Chip Pancakes. The mocha flavor was not discernible. But to for a chocolate chip pancake they were good.  My friend had eggs Benedict which was cooked beautifully and the hollandaise was creamy and rich.  Worth the visit, fix the seating and it would be a better experience.",

When walking in,I didn't know what to expect. A normal diner/ cafe. The host was very nice greeted us with a smile and a pleasant how are you. Table was instantly ready no wait. When seated they offered us drinks. We looked over the menu and ordered! Oh and our server what also nice along with a lady serving us drinks.   So we ordered, German chocolate pancakes, short shake chocolate chip pancakes, and biscuits and gravy( with potatoes, eggs , and a sausage patty). The food came out pretty quick!   Now I'm not much of an egg person but these eggs were so amazing that my family tried and kept picking off my plate. Well I can't complain to much considering I was picking off their plate too! Seriously, all three plates tasted amazing!!! I never had an export emcee where every dish on the table tasted so good. It's usually only one dish that tastes good!   For an out of town experience, I highly suggest this place! Great food, friendly staff, cozy eating establishment, and an empty stomach.",

I sometimes think then when a restaurant has good food they act like jerks because they know your gonna be back. You can't split your check no more then 2 people, and they are really rude about that. You can see the annoyance on their face and honestly I think that's just unprofessional. You can tell they get annoyed when it gets crowded but it's a restaurant with amazing food of course it's always going to be packed. I worked at a restaurant and I know at times it can feel overwhelming but this is what You signed up for, so if your gonna work in a restaurant treat your guest nicely.",

Unfortunately this time my service was awful!!!!  We got there at around 10:30 we were seated promptly after and greeted by a guy who took our drink order coffee, raspberry tea, a water, and a kids apple juice as we watched him walking back and forth and still no drinks we assumed he had forgotten then he stops again still no drinks and takes our food order and tells us he'll be back with our drinks \"ok \" 10 more minutes pass by and finally we get our drinks, roughly we waited for drinks about 20-25 minutes which is completely ridiculous! Now we get our food about 5 minutes after finally receiving our drinks and my friend who ordered toast with her omelet asks for jelly he says ok and that he'll be right back with that did he ever come back with jelly??? You guessed it nope no jelly from him I stood up myself and grabbed jelly off the breakfast bar.  now our food is almost gone our plates are piled up he never came back to refill our drinks or ask us how we were doing. Finally my friend gets up to ask the hostess to speak to the manager and guess who shows up at our table you guessed it Erik our server who is also \"the manager\" we let him know everything that went wrong and before he ever apologized his excuse was that he was busy mind you the restaurant is small and probably has a capacity of  maybe 100 ppl coming from the industry and management 101 your busy is never ever an excuse! You alway always first and foremost sincerely apologize to your guest! Ps to the general manger of this restaurant \"Clariza\" please be aware of who you leave in charge of your restaurant and get him more training ASAP  It says a lot that the worst service We have ever received came from the manager of your restaurant!!!  Don't ask for Erik aka the manager he is the guy with the colored mushroom on top of his head.  Do ask for Valerie she is awesome!",

What's with the packets of cold butter next to my leaden pancakes? Butter should be soft, pancakes should be hot. This is breakfast 101 folks.  Syrup goes on the table or comes heated from the kitchen.  Pancakes are light and fluffy.   Perhaps the Hawaiian fare is better, but if your star act can't pull off a good show, I'm a bit cool on the understudies.    Not worth the wait.",

So I had a 'oh what the heck' attitude and went to this baby stacks.   Why did I rate 1 star? I was very disappointed in this baby stacks. My girlfriend and I ordered 2 full stacks of pancakes. We waited ALMOST 40 MINUTES for our order to come thru. What made me really mad is that we didn't even get any compensation. Like a discount or even free side dishes like hash browns. Even before we could order, our waiter didn't even greet us nor take our order in a timely manner. So after 40 minutes of waiting we finally got our meal. The pancakes tasted bland and they were also burnt. At this point I didn't want to make a scene. So I forcefully ate my burnt pancakes and wanted to leave.   Never again will I ever go to this location. And to be honest, I feel like this place is just hype. Some of the prices for food are just ridiculous for the amount of food you get. I feel like most of the food they serve, you can make at home... Let's be real. For the amount of food they give you, quality of the food, bad service, do you really want to spend your hard earned money here?",

It came out warm kinda like it's been sitting in the open for a while. I wasn't too happy about that. Coras corned beef hash wasn't really special either it tasted and looked like it came out of a can, no flavor what so ever, their potatoes were not seasoned or up to temperature as well basically got a warm-cold breakfast. A breakfast platter from McDonald's comes out hotter than that. so I probably wouldn't order it again. Their specialty is pancakes and their red velvet never disappoints.  I didn't expect much from their other breakfast items.",

I ordered the kalua grilled cheese my brother the mecican skillet with a short order of carrot cake pancakes. It took 40 minutes for our food. It was hot my grilled cheese was great my hashbrowns perfect my brother said his skillet was ok that he had better. We were both done with our plates and no pancakes. We waited 10 more min the waiter came out with them. His apology \"sorry for the wait but at least their fresh\" rubbed us the wrong way. I really wanted to like this place but the service stinks.

    "text": "I absolutely loved this place. For months I came here at least three times a week for breakfast. The first thing I will say is that I've never been to a restaurant that many times and heard so many people complain about their food or service around me. They always messed up people's orders when I was in there and they did it to me a few times too. I can understand one or two mistakes here and there but they happen much more at baby cakes than any other restaurant I've been to. The waiters and waitresses always blame it on the kitchen and say they have a new cook. I've heard that one a few times spread out between months of visiting.   The final straw for me was terrible service and attitude from a waitress that has served me many times there. I'm always real nice to the staff and I like all of them except for this one lady. I tip well and I would eat there all the time. The food is good but I'm very picky with who I decide to give my money to. If the service is bad then I will take my business elsewhere. On this particular day that made me stop going my meal had been sent back THREE times for being wrong. In all this time they never even brought my pancakes out. After the third time of having to send my food back I made a fuss about it and said \"what's going on back there? I've been here for an hour and a half. The least you guys can do is bring the pancakes out to eat while I wait for my food to come.\"   The waitress must of had a bad day that day because she didn't give me an apology or show the slightest bit of sympathy. That's when I said it seems like you guys don't even care. You know I can take my business elsewhere right? She said \"yes, I know that and that's totally up to you.\"  That was it for me. I got up without my food and left my money on the counter (plus a $4 tip) and walked out. I'll never go back again. I took over 20 people to this place and ate there more than anywhere else in town. I might check out the other location one day but in spite of how I was treated I will never go to this location again. I hope they get some management in there that actually cares about the customers and quality of staff from the kitchen to the front door. For the record the waitress I spoke of was the only one there that I've seen wearing glasses. Terrible attitude",

The Banana Cream Pies are pretty darn good too! The chocolate ones are too rich for me but if you really like chocolate they will probably be right up your alley!  I usually have a short stack and share a side of bacon with my friend!   The service here is usually really friendly and quick but fair warning they are popular and have a small seating area so you might have a tad of a wait (but they are worth it)!",

The food is a Hawaiian/Filipino blend, which I liked since I'm Filipino. We had to wait for 15-20, which wasn't bad. The overall service was attentive and fast.    There were a lot of choices from savory to sweet on the menu but the most impressive items on it were the pancake selections, there were so many to choose from since they all sound so good. I went with the German Chocolate pancakes and they are to die for.  I have been craving them since I left Vegas.  I wish they had a place like this in LA.   Now if I go back to Vegas my \"must\" stop breakfast place will be Babystacks for sure!!  Maybe next time I will try the more savory stuff but definitely will get one of their pancakes choices as well.",

I did notice a nice Hawaiian referenced menu items so perhaps they specialize in that area.

The longest I wait was 30 mins, but it also depends on your party. Service also depends on your waiter and how busy it is that day. Also keep in mind, this location does not split the checks right now.   The food is delicious. I always get the chili moco and upgrade to garlic rice. It's basically a loco moco with Hawaiian chili on top. You can also upgrade If you are extremely hungry it might not full you up. I also add red velvet pancakes to it. Their red velvet pancakes are amazing. They are sweet, but not overly sweet. The sauce you pour over the pancakes compliments the pancakes very well.   Lolo adobo fried rice omelette is pretty good as well. It is a savory dish if you are looking for something like that. It is the \"locals favorite\".  I also love their lemon ricotta. The best way to describe it is that it is like a crepe. It comes out on a huge plate. But I noticed the size has been getting smaller over the years. Which makes me sad. But the flavors are amazing and it light on your stomach. One of my favorite items on the menu.",

The service is great, the staff is all so nice, and the food is top notch.  There is nothing better than a yummy Eggs Benedict to start my day with a smile...but at Babystacks Cafe, they kick it up a huge notch by making it with Hawaiian Kailua Pork!!!!  They actually have five Benedicts on the menu, but this is the one that stops me in my tracks from trying any other dish!!!  I would also recommend getting the Garlic rice rather than plain...mmmmmmm!!! My sweetie likes the Country Benedict...and it is good too...but the flavor of that Kailua Pig is totally memorable, and not to be missed!!",

First off, let's not jump to calling this place \"Hawaiian\" food. Some things in the menu are reminiscent of home... but it definitely doesn't qualify as \"Hawaiian\" food. Now that I got that out of the way...  Tons of parking in the shopping center. I came around 10am on a weekday and they were already packed. Put out names on the list and waited around 15 minutes. They're quick! The staff is super friendly. The place is clean and well-lit. Menu is super easy to understand and there are SO MANY choices! You can have you classic breakfast, or be a little more daring. I opted for a classic breakfast.   Got the bacon and eggs. You have an option to upgrade to garlic rice... do it! Well, I love garlic so that was definitely a given. It was so good! For my breakfast, I also got to have pancakes or toast. Go with the pancakes. Don't even think about it. You can upgrade to any of their pancakes. I went with the orange creamsicle. I was in heaven! Seriously, I'm not a sweets nor a pancake person but I LOVED IT. So good. Still thinking about it today.   The prices are reasonable. I highly recommend. Highly.   Enjoy!",

As basic as it sounds for you ted velvet haters, just give it a try, it's really good. I'm not much of a dessert person, but I admit they're pretty good.",

Our waitress took our drink orders- we ordered 2 coffees, one water and one Pepsi. We only received 1 coffee and 2 waters and no soda. We asked the waitress for another coffee and the soda and she tried to correct us and told us we didn't order it. Our table had no sugar so we didn't have sugar for the one coffee as well. 10 minutes later, I received my coffee and my husband got his soda about the same time our food came out.  The food was great and the pancakes are one of a kind! I'm not complaining about that at all! The short stacks comes with 3 pancakes and the regular comes with 5. You may think 3 cakes aren't enough but they're good sized pancakes with toppings on them! If you order a meal, you can add a stack of 2 pancakes for 1.75 more or less- that's a dang good deal too!  Our waitress came back to make sure everything was okay and we said we needed some sugar for the coffee, a to go box and a refill on the drinks... We got the box and sugar but refill. So my boyfriend had nothing left to drink at all. We packed our to go box and our waitress offered us a refill- which was too late because we were already about to leave and pay. We still tipped her the 15%, not for good service but we didn't want to be rude.   When we paid, we told the cashier what happened and he was kind enough to offer us a refund on the drinks or a drink to go but at that point, we just wanted to leave.   All in all, We will return to baby stacks again but hopefully we won't have that girl as our waitress.",

My 9 year old son got the red velvet short stack which he said was good and he's a critic like his mom, lol!  I definitely recommend for breakfast and lunch. I haven't ate here for dinner yet, but I'm sure I would enjoy it. Great for the family, we had a party of five. Go early to avoid the wait.

For these reasons, I only give four stars.   The staff is very friendly and I love the island music they play.   Babystacks is where I became obsessed with country fried steak. It is to die for! Gravy is delicious, steak is crunchy and flavorful, hash browns (or potato squares) are my favorite!   I believe Babystacks is well known for their red velvet pancakes (you can sub your toast for pancakes for a little extra... do it). All their pancakes are delicious: lemon ricotta, white chocolate macadamia nut, s'mores pancakes... you name it!   I've also had their adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg blanket with potato squares! Yum! And their cookie butter French toast is also delicious! You can get anything on the menu and it would be yummy!   I love coming to Babystacks, but I'll only come when I'm able to wake up early.",

It's been a long time since I've had their pancakes, but I remember them to be fluffy and awesome.

And a helpful warning,  come early before the breakfast rush or be prepared to wait because shortly after we ordered,  lines were out the door.  You know the locals have their spot.  Chocolate chip short stack- very good. Fluffy and flavorful!  Regular buttermilk short stack- indeed yummy! Even tho I do like my edge a little crispy   Portuguese sausage plate - really good! Especially if you are a rice eater in the morning (Chel's guilty!)  Eggs benedict - sad to report that it lacked life in general.  No wow factor.  Bland.   Albeit I did love the runny yolk.    White chocolate macademia nut-were ok.  I probably wouldn't order it again.  Red velvet pancakes was my favorite! One of the best I've had.  Fluffy and flavorful.   Served with their cream cheese syrup which I asked for extra serving because it was unbelievably good!  Kept me wanting more and more!!! 5/5 stars alone!!!  Red velvet pancakes will make me come back here again next trip I'm out here.  It's also their best seller!  Service was friendly.   They were indeed short handed for a Sunday?

    "text": "First of all, glad to have one on my side of town--yay!  Is it as good as the other locations? To be honest...nope! Something is definitely lacking here taste wise. Sadly, underwhelming.  In a couple visits, I was able to order and sample the following:  -Red velvet pancakes, still good, but not great. Cream cheese syrup is a must! -Cinnabon pancakes, nice flavor, but dry texture. -Bananas foster pancakes, my favorite! The sauce was amazing--not too sweet =) -Pineapple pancakes, tasted like pineapple upside cake!  Also, tasted like there was like some kind of liqeur in there...rum? Probably not. Had mine with cream cheese syrup (extra 0.75)  -Loco moco w/ garlic rice, patty sucks...plain and simple. It didn't have any flavor. Seemed like a frozen patty. I thought they made their own? Oh well. Not ordering this anymore. -Adobo fried rice (Our server called it \"adoBE\" fried rice...hehe). This one was a winner, actually BETTER than the other locations. Massive portion and lots of adobo chunks. Enough for two people to share. -Chili loco moco, pretty good, except they use the same boring patty and really skimp on the chili. Wish they topped the plate with more chili. -Kahlua pig grilled cheese, eh OK. It is missing a flavor profile. Maybe add a slaw for tang and texture or a nice aioli?  No matter what, I will still come here because I really do love Babystacks. I hope the food tastes better tho =X",

Food items chosen : * Nutella Crepes - simple, thick, Nutella crepes topped with whipped cream and almonds  * Country Fried Steak (comes with your choice of eggs, side potato and pancake) - crispy outside, moist inside, nothing special  * Plain Pancakes - served with butter and syrup * Side of Portugese Sausage - had to get a side of it, who doesn't like Portugese Sausage  \\_()_/  * Chili Moco (comes with eggs and side of potatoes) - Loco Moco smothered in chili, at first sounded good but when actually eating it.. It was pretty bland.. I was expecting a more authentic Hawaiian chili and the ground beef patty needed flavor.. Eggs weren't that great but the seasoned potatoes were good..  Expected more out of the items because I enjoyed the previous visits at the other location.. They just need to add a touch of love to the food.   Service was kind of slow but staff were still friendly ..  Maybe the food will get better as time passes.. But will most likely come back considering it's close to home..",

    "text": "Color me a fan.  I never made the trip all the way out west to try any of the older BabyStacks Cafe locations, but now that they're easily accessible to us Henderson-lings, I made it a point to go as soon as I reasonably could. That opportunity came this morning.  Walking in, I saw that it was packed and that people were sitting in the front area. Bit of confusion at the front when they didn't ask me whether I wanted to sit down or make a to-go order, so I asked if I could sit. Most of the tables looked full, and I wasn't sure whether the people in the front were waiting for a table or for a to-go order, but one of the employees told me that they had room at the counter and I immediately accepted.  After agonizing over the menu for a while, I went ahead and got a full stack of red velvet pancakes ($8.95) with a side of two eggs ($2.00), scrambled per my choice. It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, but I don't mind a little wait when the food is supposed to be good.  Turns out that it was really, really good. What I saw was a platter of six red pancakes, each about four inches in diameter, topped with a huge dollop of cold whipped cream, a dusting of chocolate sprinkles, and a plastic cup of cream cheese \"syrup\" (plus a second cup later when my server asked if I wanted more). What I tasted was absolute indlgence. The fluffy pancakes with a bit of crispiness on the edges, the cold cream to provide a temperature contrast, and the almost buttery syrup were all enjoyable to the last bite, even after I got almost sickeningly full. Heavenly.  Eggs were alright. Not sure if they were even large eggs, but I wanted some protein so I got some. Maybe I could've added a bit of salt, but no biggie. They served their purpose.  I wish that they'd stay open for dinner, but I'll take what I can get. Hopefully their Hawaiian/Filipino specialites measure up to the luxurious red velvet pancakes. I will certainly be back.",

Babystacks recently opened their Henderson location on Stephanie. Our waitress was great, very friendly and good service. We were served coffee within a minute or two of sitting down. The food did take a while to come out after ordering but we weren't in a hurry and it was definitely worth the wait (and the calories!)   I ordered their specialty, a full stack (6) of red velvet pancakes. They were served with whipped cream and a cream cheese \"syrup\" which was more of an icing. They were delicious! The short stack would have been fine but you only live once. We will definitely be back to try some egg dishes or nutella crepes.",

My personal favorite is the Banana Foster Pancakes with seasoned potatoes on the side . I was completely opposed to any toppings on buttermilk pancakes before (I'm plain jane when it comes to seasonings and toppings) but THIS will change anyone's mind ! The pancakes are cooked to perfection and the caramel and banana toppings are amaze . I always have leftovers to take home for later.

We decided to go for it since we know it was worth the wait.  We were seated right around 20-25 mins. later.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem as we were told how long the wait was, but we were seeing parties of 2, 3, and 4 that arrived after us being seated before us at 4 top tables.  Once we were seated, we promptly were greated by our server Eric.  He took our drink orders and brought them out fairly quickly.  Our orders were placed and this is where things went a little south.  We didn't get our food until after 11:10am.  When our food arrived, my pancakes were missing.  Eric advised me they were working on them.  In the meantime, my mom had spilled her maple syrup and had asked for another.  Eric never brought the syrup back so she only ate about half of the pancakes.  After another 10 mins. after receiving our food, my pancakes had not yet arrived and I had finished my eggs benedict.  Every one else was nearing being done eating as well.  I flagged down Eric and let him know he could cancel the pancakes.  He apologized and said he would take them off the bill.  The pancakes were actually the side to my Benedict, so there was nothing to remove from the bill and when we got the bill, nothing was taken off.  The time is now 11:35am and we have to be at a noon appointment, so we quickly paid and left.  If this was my first experience here, I would have rated it 3 stars, but because I know service can differ day to day and the day before was point on, I'm only going to remove one star.",

    "text": "Being from Hawai'i, eating at Babystacks Cafe is like immersing myself back in the islands. The taste of the pancakes here is reminiscent of Oahu's Cinnamon's, and is wonderful! After dining here a few times, I can say that the servers are always very polite and make great suggestions.  In the world of pancakes, I'd have to say that the Bananas Foster was my favorite! My boyfriend however, said that his favorite was the red velvet. We also tried the corned beef hash breakfast and the rachero omelette (pics attached) which were equally delicious. Corned beef hash is such an island favorite! They let you upgrade to garlic rice for $1 extra which is well worth it.   Next time we go back, we're looking forward to trying all the kalua pig options on the menu! Try to go early if you can so you can avoid the line. But even if you have to wait in line, there is a pokestop next door at Mongolian Grill!",

    "text": "Normally love this place. I even tell people about it all the time. After today, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody Cuz I would be embarrassed to. First of all,  I ordered a side of bacon extra crispy for my daughter. When the food came, there was no bacon.  I remember ordering it because I asked her if she just wanted one side or two and she said one so I told the server just one side of bacon. So I had to reorder it and said extra crispy. My daughter finally got her bacon and my son and I were already done with our food.  The bacon was not crispy so she only ate part of the bacon that I paid $3.95 for.  Aside from that,  the guy bringing our drinks gave us one straw when we had 2 cold drinks. We had to keep hunting someone down for a straw. The couple at the table next to us didn't even get any.  Then,  nobody came for refills for coffee.  I finally saw someone come out to do refills but he just talked to the one table he refilled and went back in the kitchen.  I was finally asked if I wanted more coffee when the server came to give me my ticket. We had been done eating for about 10 minutes by then.  Today was really disappointing.  By the way, all that time I was waiting for a straw, I watched the guy bring out every drink and just walked away without giving them straws and he had them in his apron pocket",

As someone who is Asian and having rice as our staple food, we kind of know how it should be prepared.  AND, if an establishment will be serving Island/Asian infused food, they should get the rice cooked properly.  It was annoying having to eat soggy but hard rice with the spam.  Just didn't seem kosher.  So that just kind of put a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  But I still gave them 3 stars because the pancakes are always amazing!",

For things other than pancakes, the food has a Hawaiian Filipino influence, again delicious and fun.",

If your going to give someone a bad attitude because of the tip you didn't like keep it to yourself. Tips are optional when you get good service. If your money is all you guys care about and not guest service then I hope you guys get more training for your employees",

    "text": "They do not take reservations and there was a long wait on Sunday even at 130pm. Inside waiting area was full and several more waiting outside. I did appreciate the hostess requiring for everyone in the party to be there before they put them down on the list.   Then came an unfortunate bad judgment call by the hostess while we were waiting to get seated.  At some point someone left and when they came back  the hostess gave them the next table. Not fair to those that stayed and were patiently waiting.  It delayed our seating as they already were playing Tetris to fit our party of 6.  Six parties that came in after us were seated (3 of them taking the rare and precious larger tables - but not the patrons fault but they felt our pain - even one person advised that we were here way before them)  Had egg white omelet with chicken spinach and mushrooms. Came with potatoes. No cheese but included for same $9.25 price.  Egg whites are $1.25 extra. Senior breakfast well worth it $6.95 for two eggs, side of meat potatoes and 2 pancakes. Can substitute for toast. Eggs were done perfect.  Server came to the table to get drink order right as soon as we sat down. When he dropped off our drinks took our food order and about 10 minutes later the food came out. Everything the way we requested.  Niece ordered abobo omelet. Was better this time. Last time was a bit salty for my taste but was told that's normal (that adobo in general is slightly salty not that is how the restaurant prepares it)  Food 4 stars Server 4 stars - got everything perfect and technically didn't need anything but never checked back on us Having to wait longer due to bad judgment and making excuses why they thought they had to which will cause me never to come back  0 stars",

The guy who was helping us was a very flamboyant homosexual and was very attitude e and disrespectful! We are grown men who are born and raised in this city and should not have to deal with this type of disrespect from a little punk! Will definitely never be eating at this establishment ever again! We will definitely be spreading the word of the unprofessionalism of this restaurant! And when we called to ask for the manager the little punk hung up on us and would not put one on the phone!",

They have a great selection of pancakes; from banana pancakes to chocolate mint! They also have a lot of comfort/filling food. They have Loco mocos, breakfast foods such as eggs, spam, and rice. I recommended getting the island favorite, which consist of rice, eggs, banana nut muffin, and porteguese sausage. For pancakes, I really like the red velvet and chocolate mint. The prices are around 10 dollars a plate, the pancakes comes in stack of 2 for 4 dollars each. They service is friendly and they take care of you.  Update: after being here a handful of times, I strongly suggest trying out their skillets, specially the Huntington skillet. Also for pancakes, give their German chocolate pancake a bite!",

Pancakes are always fluffy and good flavors so if you or someone you know LOVES pancakes this is the number on spot. My favorite so far is carrot cake. I tried banana cream pie today and is was pretty good. It had a whipped topping, cut bananas and almonds. I usually like the toppings but the banana pancake was good on its own.   I had a classic breakfast today- I ordered Portuguese Sausage with two sunny side up eggs and garlic rice. This is the best way to order it cause you just put the eggs right over the rice and yum. If you don't like too much garlic and onions stick with regular rice. You do need a breath mint after eating.   I like the food here and it's good. The price is okay and the servers were nice. You will enjoy this place but I recommend a small group so you don't have to wait too long.",

Seriously, all 20 or so options of pancake combinations are amazing. What is also amazing at this cafe and that I really suggest every tries, is their Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, sooo good and flavorful.  The only thing that could be different that would probably be popular with a lot of their patrons is that they do not split checks here! I understand the reasoning, it just can be slightly inconvenient with groups of people.",

    "text": "I've been to Babystacks twice. Each time it was fairly busy. People on Yelp seem to like it well enough. I was enticed by the photos of meals and pancake creations. However, each time I've been here, I've been underwhelmed by the main dish I chose (first time was adobe fried rice omelette, second time was country fried steak with garlic rice.) I am pretty particular about my eggs in that I prefer them to be cooked when I eat them. All too often I've ordered a fried egg and they arrive under cooked. While here, I asked for a fully cooked fried egg. The server suggested medium and added that the yoke would still be runny. That's fine with me if the yoke is runny, I'd just like the white parts to be fully cooked. Well, when I received my meal, the outside of the egg was cooked, the yoke was runny, but there was a significant part of the white part on the inside that was still raw. It was more like over easy. I don't like that at all and had requested that it be fully cooked. I don't personally find it difficult to fully cook an egg, even while keeping the yoke a bit runny. So this was a disappointment. The rest of the dish was fine, but not amazing. When scrambled, the eggs here seem fine, but I think a restaurant should offer well served eggs in all variations. Also the garlic rice, which was described as being garclicy with onions, tasted fairly bland. As far as the pancakes go, they have an incredible range of flavor choices, I loved having all those options. However, both times I have dined here, my experience with the pancakes did not exceed places like IHOP or Denny's in terms of fluffiness and flavor. (However IHOP's eggs do not even meet my basic requirements. In fact, my other wanted to go to IHOP this morning, but thinking about their eggs, I Yelped a bit and we settled on Babystacks.) Anyway, back to my review, I couldn't even finish the entire half stack of pancakes before feeling sick. And let me tell you, I am a sugar fiend. Waffles, pancakes and French toast with all the sugary sweet toppings are my jam. Unfortunately, I will probably not be returning here because my experiences have been consistently underwhelming. Please keep in mind, the service was great, and it seems that many people enjoy this place just fine. This is just my experience and I hope it is helpful one way or another.",

Our waiter was a nice guy and even tho he messed up my girlfriends order a little bit. He saw he made a mistake and took the food away and made it fresh immediately.

Upon arrival they seemed pretty busy and I thought we were going to have to wait seeing there were only a few tables.  We got to sit down right away.  I've read all the review about how they had poor service or slow service.  Today or at least with us the service was great.  No complaints in that department.   I ended up ordering carrot cake pancakes and steak and eggs.  It did not disappoint.  The food was nice and hot and delicious.  If I had to complain about anything it would be about how small the restaurant.  I can honestly see Babystacks Cafe outgrowing this building.  If they had a larger building they'd definitely make tons of money because the breakfast was good and I'd definitely go back again.   Babystacks has a Eggworks kinda feel to it but on a smaller scale.  I don't want to say ignore the bad reviews but just prepared for a wait.....and if you don't have to wait then that's a plus.     The employees have a family feel so I was curious and asked if the restaurant was family owned and the answer was yes.  Definitely give it a go and compliment me like crazy because I'm super awesome!",

The pancakes had the essence of strawberry lemonade so it was not overpoweringly sweet or tart. Paired perfectly with the cream cheese syrup. They were cooked perfect (fluffy but with a cake like texture).Everything we had tasted FRESH. Great service as well. Thank you Valerie! We will be back.",

The place was packed on a Sat. morning but tables were turned quickly so it wasn't that bad of a wait time. I had a chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and smores pancakes-YUM! The wife loves her Red Velvet Pancakes as well. Great food, great service, good prices!",

Even if you said they are around the corner they want seat you .   They also served cold coffee as well ?  No freshness ?  I know it's just coffee but what's your Standard ? Wasn't aloud to sit outside it was closed because it was dirty they said.  Standards again ?  Place was not for me and my family and friends so didn't want to here any more rules from this place so we left",

Generous amount of fresh banana slices with a banana sauce on fluffy pancakes served with light whipped cream.  Enough said.",

    "text": "My husband and I met to eat at Babystacks during our lunch break from work. We were seated promptly at a table right in the front of the restaurant.   It was a freezing day and every time someone would open the front doors a huge gust of icy cold air would rush over us. It took a long time for our food to come out. Only my Eggs Benedict were served, so I had to eat it before my husband's burger came several minutes later or it'd get cold. Right away I noticed it's appearance was pretty sad. Also, the eggs were hard cooked, not runny at all. I notified the waiter, who asked if I wanted it remade. I had to decline due to time constraints.  Their bathroom was pretty nasty. It was smelly and the grout is disgustingly filthy. Our waiter didn't bring our bill, so we just went up to the cashier and the clerk there printed it up for us. My husband's burger was decent though. The Eggs Benedict at The Original Pancake House (Fort Apache & Flamingo) blows this place' out of the water. 0% chance of ever returning.",
