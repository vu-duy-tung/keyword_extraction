    "text": "Solid Italian food spot in Summerlin :)  We started off with the Complimentary Bread with Olive Olive and Vinegar.  Good!  Pasta E Fagioli ($5 Cup): Cannellini Beans & Pasta. This was good overall. Heavy on the beans...it was not finished.  I would skip this personally.  Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($12): Chicken Breast, Roasted Peppers, Baby Greens & Goat Cheese. Pretty good! Good flavored chicken with lots of greens/veggies.  Fair portion size as well.   Veal Parmagiana ($16): Baked Breaded Veal Scaloppini, Marinara & Mozzarella.  This was good, with thinly sliced veal and lots of flavor in the baked cheese.  Recommended!  Penne Marinara was my side choice with entree. The pasta was under-cooked, and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. I'd choose the steamed veggies or sauteed spinach next time.  Skip this too.  Give em a try if you are in the area.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it again though.",

Their Ossobuco is ridiculously good. Mastrioni's excels with their daily specials. But you also can't go wrong ordering off the everyday menu. The Veal Parmesan is excellent.  This is a go to spot for my wife and I for special occasions or just a spontaneous date night. For my money, it is some of the best dining in Las Vegas.",

The last two times we have been, service was terrible. Tonight, we took our family there and was placed in the corner table. Our server either had too many tables or just didn't give us the attention we deserved. There was a birthday party at another table that were taken care of as we sat for an hour without food. Our appetizers came before our wine. They completely forgot about my eggplant parmigiana. Everyone else at the table was served and when we asked they said they forgot and were making it right then. While I was still eating (and it wasn't even hot), we ordered our kids dessert, so we wouldn't have to sit for even longer. I also don't remember them asking if we needed anything after our food was served. I'm just really surprised at the lack of customer service.",

The food itself was just as good if not better than most places but what got me was the fact when I was looking at the menu for desert and didn't see my fave, I told the waiter and he told me he might have one that they made and didn't put it on the menu that night.

That was the first interaction we had with him. Then she asked if the bartender made a good Long Island Ice Tea.. he said \"I wouldn't know.\" I've never had a server be so rude. I will never return or recommend. The food quality was also poor. Had the Penne Chicken Spinach. It was drenched in a sweet sauce. Barely touched it.",

The inside was nicely decorated and it definitely gave out an Italian flare. We really enjoyed our meals except for their chopped salad. Very bland as the dressing could have used some help. Chicken Marsala was excellent as was their Chicken Piccata. My wife had a gluten free chicken dish with Penne and said it was terrific.  We ordered wine by the glass and really enjoyed the selections. Our server was the best and made our evening that much more enjoyable. Would definitely come back, but will skip the chopped salad.

As for entrees my mom had never tried vodka sauce so we both decided on the Shrimp and Scallop Vodka, which were delicious and my dad opted for the N.Y. Steak Grilled (medium/cooked perfectly) with sauteed spinach side MOUTHWATERING!  We finished off by sharing the Creme Puffs which were YUUUUUUMMMMY!

    "text": "I enjoy giving local businesses a try, especially since big restaurant chains can get a bit boring.  Upon arriving, I was impressed with inside decor.  Not bad for a strip mall restaurant.  As for the service, I was not that impressed.  Let me start with the bread, it's plain and not fresh.  I've had better from Smith's grocery.  The seafood appetizer was delicious, something I would order again.  It was the Combo Oreganate, a combination of shrimp, scallop, clams and mussels stuffed with bread crumbs and baked on top of butter and garlic.  That sauce was the only thing that the bread was useful for in dipping with.  The waiter was not very attentive, and when I ordered the entree and appetizer, he was quick to correct my pronunciation.  Yeah, I get it; I can't pronounce your fricken menu.  Thanks for the lesson.  My husband ordered a steak and asked for it to be medium-well.  I tell my husband to always just order medium, but he's just not a fan of getting red meat.  Upon getting our entrees, we both notice how burnt his steak looks.  I order chicken, so everything seems to be in order.  The waiter drops off our entrees and quickly disappears.  He never once came back to check if everything was ok.  I'm assuming he knew how overcooked the meat was and did not want to address it.  I understand that medium-well means a small amount of pink in the center, not charred and dry.  We had to track down another waiter to send it back.  So the waiter sends it back to the waiter that was helping us and instead of checking the meat, he quickly runs over and says, \"What, medium-well is too medium-well for you?\"  My husband was polite to respond, but I wanted to deck the guy for his attitude.  I'm not sure if he's an owner, a manager, or lead waiter, but his attitude was crappy.  He goes back and checks things out.  A few minutes later he comes back to apologize.  Gee, you think if you checked the meat out before you made such a comment it would have made the experience less dreadful?  We did not reorder the steak.  The bill was paid and we left with a bad experience.  I would give this place another shot if it wasn't for the comment the waiter made.  I was offended and have a feeling there was a pre-judgment made by the waiter based on our casual attire, but either way, it was uncalled for.  There was definitely a lack of service to correct the situation or for forgiveness to come back and try the restaurant again.",

Their lunch prices are very reasonable for the quality. The bread is delicious, and so is the salad dressing. This is my second large luncheon at this restaurant and both times it was superb! They even let me bring in cupcakes, which they served to us. As a former cooking teacher and caterer (and Italian to boot) I'm very picky about food, and Mastrioni's gets a big thumbs up from me. Great for lunch, happy hour or dinner, Mastrioni's won't disappoint!",

    "text": "The food was above average . I will not return based on the  poor/slow service from our waiter Kurt. The hostess/manager  ( about forty dark hair pulled back)at the door seemed angry and was unpleasant from the minute we walked in. To summarize the evening: food was bought and placed on our table that wasn't even ours. It was then picked up from our table and served to the table beside us. All of our entrees were brought at different times,the last entree didn't arrive till the rest of the table were pretty much done with their entrees After all entrees were served ,eaten and cleared,we asked about the salad. It was brought at that time. The waiter Kurt came over to me and apologized for the really bad service.He brought over cream puffs gratis. He still charged us for the coffee that came with the cream puffs and for the salad that we had to practically beg to receive. I would have liked to discuss the bad service with a manager but we couldn't find one. This being my first visit I had great expectations i was very let down.",

    "text": "I wouldn't guess it from the exterior, but Mastrioni's occupies a beautiful space. It's located in a strip mall and has the typical stucco outside. But on the inside the restaurant has high ceilings dedicated only to open air. The tables are nicely spaced apart and set with linens, art on the walls. Super classy.   I really want to like this place, but the food wasn't so great. I went with a couple friends for lunch. I think out of all of the entrees we ordered, mine was the best. I got the Shrimp and Scallop Vodka Pasta ($17). I am a sucker for a vodka sauce and this dish didn't disappoint. The scallops were cooked perfectly: to a supple tenderness, not overdone. And the scrimps were shelled all the way to the tail. I love that. The dish had a nice balance was nicely portioned.   My bf got the Veal Marsala ($16). I had a taste of the sauce and - holy crap (in a bad way). It  was way too sweet. My first thought was pancake syrup.   My mom got the Pork Tenderloin ($15), which she said was not so tender. She said the gravy was very tasty and hearty, but so hearty that she could barely taste the pork. Well, hot damn.   Both my mom and bf got a side of spinach with their entree. I thought the spinach was pretty salty. I love salt, but I love balance more.   They played smooth jazz -- Buble and Sinatra -- during our stay.    They tout a full bar. My mom ordered a Long Island Ice Tea. My bf noticed they only serve three Italian reds by the glass. Seems a bit under par for an Italian joint.   Mastrioni's is a nice place to chill and the service was great. But the food wasn't good enough to make me want to return.   #offthestrip #noncasino",

Love the atmosphere and ambience. It's not to quiet, but not very loud here either. I sat at the bar last night, which was a cozy intimate spot in front of the kitchen. We ordered a round of the clams, the cioppino, and the chicken Francese. The clams were a really good, if not perfect, appetizer with warm bread. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the Chicken Francese: my every time choice meal. It just wasn't that great; it was very bland with nothing to it. Had to much egg too. The sauce was yummy...with bread tho (lol). For the first time in forever, I didn't finish it or ask to take it home. Wah. The man ordered the cioppino, but it wasn't anything special either. Just okay... Sadly, it was his first time at Mastronis, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to convince him to give it another go in the future.Not really sure what's going on here (by the look of the yelp reviews) or if it was a bad night to dine with them, but probably won't revisit again for a bit.",

Even though its located inside a strip-mall type setting, the interior is very nicely done. Bar for a quick drink of finger food, semi-private area if you want to have a small party, and the normal tables are large enough to handle the portions. We had the shrimp cocktail (super), Palm salad (colorful, not too much dressing, just the right sized heats of palm), and the Chicken Vesuvius. Top that with a Blueberry martini which was not from some pre-mix but made from hand, and you've got yourself a fine fun meal. I'm sure their desserts are great too, but we were way too full to even try.  So, just a great place to eat and seems like a fun location to hang out. Glad we stumbled upon it.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to come here tonight because we were craving spaghetti and meatballs. Our server came to take our order and was telling us about the specialty items on the menu. One of those items was king crab legs. We decided to order that and also get an order of spaghetti and meatballs.  Our food came out incredibly fast and we were incredibly happy about that. The crab legs were delicious. When we tried the spaghetti and meatballs the pasta sauce as well as the meatballs were incredibly bland. We decided to return it and get something else. The waiter brought us a bolognaise dish but ultimately it just looked like a smashed up version of the spaghetti and meatballs and practically tasted the same with a little more seasoning. We ate it anyways. We decided to order a creme brulee for desert which was really good. We had also ordered a $25 bottle of wine with our food. When the check came we had realized our waiter failed to mention the price of the crab legs appetizer before we decided to order it and the cost for about four (not even full legs) crab legs was $65. Despite our waiter being incredibly friendly and welcoming, he still charged us for the meal we returned and did not have the decency to comp the spaghetti and meatballs or at least the desert due to our dissatisfaction. All in all our total was about $140 including a tip. I was very disappointed in the meal and what my boyfriend paid for it. It was absolutely not worth the cost. We will not be returning to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I had a hard time choosing the rating for this place since I had mixed feelings about the food and service. When I walked in there was no hostess at the stand. A waiter came to greet us and said someone would be right over. No one really came? Finally got seated after a while. The people behind me were irked that no one came to greet them and asked how long I was waiting.  Appetizers: eh sauteed calamari- thought I'd give this a try since you don't really see sauteed calamari on menus. comes in red or white wine sauce. The calamari was OKAY. wasn't great, wasn't bad, just slightly chewy. We ordered white wine and i SWEAR the waiter said he was going to bring a side of the red wine sauce for us to try but no such sauce appeared. The sauce was so plain and so watery. It literally tasted like they made this great sauce and poured water on it to spread it a little further. When I ordered this dish I imagined I would be able to dip the bread in the sauce. would NOT recommend caprese- this was good. no place can really mess this up. they also give you oil and balsamic vinegar on the side to top it.  Entrees: ordered all the specials seafood risotto- i enjoyed this dish it was filled with seafood. It came with about 4 large shrimp, lots of calamari, scallops, mussels, and peas. after eating the sauteed calamari i was calamaried out. this had a lot of calamari in it. there were also a fair amount of peas, if you don't like peas better ask for it to be left out. it was perfect! came piping hot, not TOO creamy and just the right amount of flavor. would order again! eating my leftovers for breakfast!! lobster ravioli- after all the hype via yelp we had to try the lobster ravioli and boy did it deliver. the ravioli was delish!! it was also sprinkled on top with more lobster chunks. the noodle was made with spinach or mushroom or something (the ravioli was striped) and a little bigger than the traditional square, more like a rectangle.  ate everything and then wiped up the sauce with bread. SLURP. bone-in veal- i didn't try this but my friend ordered it. He said it was alright and didn't seem impressed. he enjoyed the other two dishes more.  Dessert:  Cannoli- I loveeeeeeee cannolis and I haven't found a GREAT cannoli to rave about in Vegas. this order came with two, but not that great. would not order again Sauteed banana gelatto- this was... just banana gelatto. good but i was expecting more from the name. maybe like chunks of banana or something in it?  Overall they did a a good job with the entrees. The desserts and the appetizers are ones to forget. The waiter took our bread basket away to get more and then we had to ask for it 3 times to get it back. We ordered a specific year for our wine and was brought the incorrect one. Also the clientele there that evening were dressed very.... minimal... Not something you'd expect at an off the strip restaurant. Something to consider for those with children. I'm coming back to this place but going straight to the entrees on the specials!",

We were disappointed from the start as neither hostess could acknowledge us as they were too busy in conversation with who seemed like a regular and he was more apologetic than they once discovered we had been standing there for some time. We were then told seating was limited but the counter was available.    The porter brought water and bread quickly. Pete was our waiter and seemed attentive as we ordered our drinks and apps.  The food came quickly. We ordered fried calamari, Caesar salad, chicken Alfredo and chicken piccata.  The calamari was great, the salad was below average for the $15 charged. Boyfriend was happy with his piccata and my Alfredo was bland and chicken way over cooked.  Pete also disappeared after our food was ordered. We wanted to order desert but didn't as we began to get agitated.    The bill, however was delivered quickly once Pete was found and we were disappointed to spend over $100 on a very below average meal and service.  You might be better off having a reservation and sitting in the dining room as opposed to the counter.    There's a great place around the corner called Chef Marc's that's a much better value for a comparable price. And you'll for sure get offered desert.",

The crab cakes (loaded with crab meat) rival anything I've ever eaten in Baltimore. The veal marsala was amazing, tender and full of flavor. Even the creme brulee was on point! Complements to the chef!  Michael \"our server\" didn't miss a beat, even his wine recommendation was spot on.  I've been in Vegas for 28 year's and this is by far the best Italian seafood resturant in the valley!  Can't wait to go back, keep up the good work.",

These last few years have shown a steady decline in the quality of the cuisine, the service, and atmosphere.  It is with sadness I state we will not be returning any time soon.  The salad was lackluster and presentation weak. The vodka sauce was watery and tasteless. The ice tea was completely flavorless.  And all the portions minuscule.  The service was... sporadic, uninformed, and uncouth.  Worst of all there seems to be no leadership. No maitre-d' or GM was visibly present and it showed. Never at any time were we welcomed, asked about our meal or thanked for our patronage.  Denying us any opportunity to share our experience and input on the meal and service.  There are restaurants in this town with far less complicated menus and less expensive price points that out this place to shame.",

I love everything about the process of prep and the profiles of flavor. If you want a great experience of this just sit at their bar and watch the chef work. You will appreciate your food more.  I had the shrimp app. Very very good. The New York steak was cooked perfectly rare. The tomato garnish was even amazing. That should be a menu option. Very impressive.  So don't think a restaurant can't deliver on quality because it is between a nail salon and a liquor store. This place is outstanding.",

The veal special was for my dad and he loved it. The server, I think his name was James (a bronco fan), was so attentive and the entire staff was great. My daughter spilled her drink and they were so sweet to her and cleaned up quickly. I ordered calamari the penne with chicken, mushroom and sundried tomatoes and it was to die for. We had fettucini alfredo at the table with chicken and the sauce had so much flavor. Even the cheesecake for dessert was excellent. The o ly thing that wasn't great was the bruschetta, the tomatoes were not ripe and it could have used salt or balsamic in my opinion. But the rest was amazing!",

So, I'm half way through eating my spaghetti and meatballs and the first bite I had had high hopes and the hope melted like the meatball in my mouth. The meat was tender and juicy, however their was no flavor or spice. I felt as though I was eating the spaghetti and meatballs from a hospice center. What did help was the scrumptious garlic bread that I used to fill up on.   After the disappointment, I turned to my friend who got the shrimp linguini and he chowed down on the glorious shrimps first. With a grin on his face he dug into the linguini. Within a few moments I recognized the look on his face, it was the exact look I had when I first took a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The linguini and the sauce had a mild garlic butter flavor and he wasn't a big fan either.   I gave it two stars because of the garlic bread and the shrimp.",

The owners are from New York and have made this place one of the best Italian places in Vegas.  If you like watching the kitchen and food preparation, sit at the bar and enjoy the show! Original review 6-3-2015 First off let me say this was my go to Italian place!  Ive gone 6+ times and have no problems with the price as long as the food is great and service is super too.  That being said...one of my favorites is the seafood over linguini....in the past it was awesome with a nice blend of seafood.  This last time...it was LOADED with calamari and they were as rubbery as hell.  I literally could not eat it.  I was stunned!  Usually the food has been SO GOOD in the past...I wondered if they changed owners or chefs. I ate what I could...then decided some spumoni pie with coffee would end the meal on a high note....well not so.  The coffee was good..but the ice cream spumoni pie was direct from the deep freeze and was HARD as a rock.  It was not edible until it defrosted for 30 mins....I was so disappointed in Mastrioni's.  I did mention it to the waiter...but he just shrugged it off saying it will get better when thawed...well no duh.  Then to end the evening...the wait staff do not seem to know what one is doing with the others.  The table next to ours....the couple left...and it sat for a few mins before they could clear the dishes.   Then another wait staff came over and removed the table cloths and napkins and placed clean a clean table cloth on. LOL then the original wait staff came over and  removed the table cloth thinking it was dirty...and proceeded to put another one.  It was comical.  Hopefully they will smooth out the rough edges.",

The guys in the kitchen know all the regulars and it seems that every time I'm there a customer makes a trip to the open kitchen to compliment the cooks. They don't have Lasagna on the menu, but if they are not slammed and you asked nicely the chef will have someone make it for you. It is so good! The Halibut Picatta  is amazing. I've never had a meal there that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. A little pricey but worth every penny. If you like watching people cook, find a seat at the bar and enjoy the show!",

Then we ordered dinner, I ordered the clam chowder and shrimp scampi linguini again, they were out of the chowder, the linguini had burnt garlic in it and tasted horrible. My daughter ordered the rigatoni and it was good, the waiter brought me a new shrimp linguini and it was excellent. Because I had to wait for a second meal, my daughter had already finished and was ready for dessert, but a dessert menu came way after the fact. When it came time to pay the bill, I was charged for the clam chowder that I never got! I left disappointed and won't return.",

Perfect place for a small cute romantical dinner for two. I did not really order off the menu, so I cant speak much about how large their variety was. We asked to be sent things out to try from the chefs recommendations. Some of the dishes I never thought I would like  I was really surprised with and loved!! Most of the things we tried appetizer wise have a little twist in them which makes me a happy camper! I love the ambiance and the food, for sure I wana go back and order an Item or two from the menu and compare them to my normal liking!  But IF I can give a recommendation I would definitely recommend the tiramisu cake that is home made!!! Its one of the best I have ever had, LOVED it!!",

The tiramisu is made there locally by one of the waiters and the service is outstanding.  How anybody could give this place one or two stars is beyond understanding.

The antipasti and grilled vegetable platter were delicious. Generous portions.  I had the chicken Parmesan which I thought was done to perfection. I love when it has little crispy edges. My husband loved his cioppiino, he only wished it came with linguine. Two of the others had osso buco which was gigantic, I had a bite and it was very tasty. The veal cooked perfectly and tender.  I loved the decor, dark woods, low lighting, tables not too close together. They made the evening a great celebration for my aunt and uncle.",

During dinner he opened presents and we spoke of his bday in front of server. When server asked if we wanted dessert I replied quickly with a loud, firm yes giving server the \"eye\" of 'don't forget his bday'. They had acknowledged at least 6 others birthdays at tables around us. When server asked what we wanted I replied with 'it's his birthday - he gets to choose'. NOTHING. They never acknowledged. It was disappointing. I requested and followed up and they did nothing. Not sure if we will return, even when food was great!  It kind of put a damper on th evening.",

We arrived early and there was no wait but the restaurant filled up quickly.   Despite arriving before the crowd we were a little disappointed to get very little attention there at first. Drinks, menus and bread were slow to come.  Once we got the attention of our waiter it was still slow to get appetizers and entrees ordered but we were happy to indulge in bread as we waited.  Our entire table ordered fish dishes. I went with the halibut piccata and we shared the bruschetta as an appetizer. The bruschetta had a huge amount of tomato. It was delicious. The fish was well prepared. I enjoyed everything about my meal.   The service was lackluster but I am still excited to come back and try them again.",

One of us had the spaghetti with meatballs, the other the baked ziti. Both dishes were amazing! Meatballs were huge and well seasoned. Spaghetti and sauce were hot and tasty. Lots of delicious cheese on the ziti. Portions were very large; I took a box home. Service was excellent! We'll be back!  May 2017 Update:  We tried here again and unfortunately, not a great experience. Biggest issue was LONG wait for food and mediocre service. Downgrading to three stars; maybe short-staffed tonight. Food was still good.",

About 15 minutes from The Palms, Mastrioni's was every bit as good as any Italian Restaurant in New York. Seriously, I don't say that lightly! Our server was awesome, and the food was top-notch. The Shrimp Francese was billed as the best in Vegas, and it really was. The place was so good, we went back 2 days later for lunch.  We're not easy to please when it comes to Italian Restaurants, but we'll never do Vegas again without dinner at Mastrioini's. Don't take my word for it, see for yourself!!",

    "text": "There are 2 reasons why this place is getting 3 Stars from me. Reason number one is that i actually never physically ate inside the restaurant. I usually just order for pick up & eat it at home. So i can't really give it a full rating until i actually sit in and dine. I love their food. Their Ziti, meatballs & raviolis are good. My husband enjoys their steaks also. Now the second reason why they got 3 stars from me is because of customer service over the phone. About 90% of the time when i ordered i get the same girl on the phone. I don't know her name, but she sounds like she does not want to be there. If you ask her a question it seems like you're bothering her and she responds back with a bit of an attitude. She also tries to rush you off the phone. I will try to visit this restaurant in the near future and actually dine in so that i can update the review. Hopefully the service in person is a whole lot better.",

    "text": "My friend chose Mastrioni's for her birthday celebration.  What a rotten dining experience!  It was like a newly opened restaurant where the staff doesn't know the menu or specials and don't know their job duties.  After ordering, we realized we hadn't heard the daily specials and had to ask.  We ordered drinks at the same time but my two friends got their iced tea and I had to wait for water.  They brought two of our meals and it took another 10 minutes for the third one to be delivered.  My ravioli was boring.  The ricotta cheese was like eating it straight from the carton and the sauce was bland.  It was merely palatable.  The birthday girl's meal was not what she wanted so we sent it back to be recooked.  Most restaurants would tell the cook staff it was a refire so it would be a priority, not Mastrioni's.  We were done with our meals and her's still hadn't come.  We had to ask several times for a status.  Also, a waiter refilled one iced tea but failed to refill the second one, left the table to get more water for me and it took 15 minutes for a refill.  We asked him for the iced tea and he went to get it.  When he came back he forgot the water but asked my friend if he could take her empty plate and she said yes.  He reached for the plate and we asked about the birthday girl's meal, he said he would check on it and left the table with the empty plate still on the table. The we saw him breaking down a dirty table without a status on my friend's food. The birthday girl had to get up and go over to him because he never came back with a status. The birthday girl discussed all  of this with the manager and we never saw the manager again. Mastrioni's was a disorganized mess!",

Service was awesome...A+.  someone was always available to clear away, refresh drinks, serve, offer condiments or check on us in general.    The food was also spectacular.  Didn't care for the desserts, so only an A.   We split a salad (they kindly plated it in the back so no embarrassing scooping of food at the table!) and there wasn't a green morsel left. My husband loves spaghetti & meatballs and theirs didn't disappoint!  I had the scallops & they were delish!!   Like I said, desserts didn't wow either of us.    I wanted to briefly speak to the manager on duty about hosting a dinner for 45 people every quarter, but she was too busy to speak to me (no lie...that's what they told me) & the waiter brought some copies of menus with a handwritten name of who to call.  My husband said he'd like for the waiter to mention to the manager that we'd really like to speak to her very briefly...less than 2 minutes (to compliment the staff...we decided not to hassle her w/ the large party conversation).  The waiter came back & told us she said it could be a while...like 20-25 minutes or more.  I was speechless.  Granted they were busy, but what manager on duty doesn't have time for a customer....especially one wanting to give more business &/or compliment the wait staff.  Left w/ a very icky feeling & decided it was not a place I would entrust to do my quarterly employee awards dinner.  Their loss...there are tons of restaurants in LVNV w/ good food, good wait staff AND good managers!!",

The grilled veggie plate was perfect, the veggies were all still warm, and the garlic marinated peppers were so good.  The seafood salad was traditional and incredibly well cooked....meaning the squid/prawns/scallops were barely cooked thru so they stayed tender. Dressing was perfect balance of evoo and lemon with lots of micro-greens/celery/capers. It was a very large order enough for 4 to share as an appetizer.  The spaghetti bolognese was excellent, as good as I have had in a long time. I am an Italian chef and make this dish several ways and generally don't think much of most bolognese sauce in most restaurants because it is just not that great....often good but not great. This sauce neared perfection. What was amazing was they split it for us and came out with two large pasta bowls filled. The order was huge, great value for sure.  Our waiter Vince was excellent, so friendly and enjoyed talking cucina italiano well after they closed. Kudos to such good service.  We will be back.",

Outside of the over dressed caesar salad and the burnt garlic bread ( we did not complain), the food was very good. The calamari was hot and crispy and tender, the veal and eggplant parms did not diappoint and the grouper picatta was delicious. What spoiled the experience for us was our waiter. Even though we were his only table for most of our lunch, he seemed hell bent on ignoring us. It got even worse when he picked up another table of two. I would return for the food and hope that our poor service was a singular occurance.",

    "text": "Mastrionis is without a doubt, one of the best and most hidden gems in all of Las Vegas, especially for Italian food. My wife and I have been coming here for special occasions including wedding anniversaries.  This place is easy to drive by, as its smack dab in the middle of a little row of businesses and could easily be overlooked like a typical deli or subway from the outside, and it's tinted windows make it difficult to see inside.  Once inside however, this place is very classy. It's well lit with a well dressed and well mannered staff.  The first time we went, for appetizers my wife ordered the bruschetta which was incredibly flavorful and obviously prepared fresh.  She insist it's some of the best she has had. I myself took the opportunity to order the crab cakes, which I am always hesitant to do as most places typically delivery small cakes that are not worth it. At mastrionis however, the crab cakes I got were large in size and full of flavor, a must have for any fan of crab cakes.  In addition to this the restaurant also serves bread with olive oil and balsamic which is just a great way to start your meal.  For dinner we again tried something different, I myself ordered the fettuccini Alfredo and added the shrimp to it.  The pasta had a rich creamy flavor with a thick sauce that can never be accused of being watered down. The shrimp were big and fresh and added that seafood taste to my dish that I was craving.  My wife ordered the Parmesan chicken, which was also large in size and fantastic tasting. You could actually taste the seasoning and flavor in the chicken instead of just a mouth full of bread. The dish also came with a side of pasta with a home made marinara sauce that was just outstanding.    Pros: a very romantic atmosphere for a date but also very family friendly. It's got a darker interior which I personally enjoy. Outstanding food, some of the very best I have had in Vegas or California. After eating here you'll likely never step foot into a chain like Olive Garden again.  This place also has generous portions on the plates and appetizers we have tried here.  Cons: Pricing. A dinner salad will run $10 which despite excellent flavor seems a little steep.  Adding shrimp to my pasta was about $4 I believe which felt a little high considering the amount they give.  This alone was the only thing preventing 5 stars.  When we went the first time we ordered two appetizers, tow salad, two meals and two drinks which ran us $100+. Salads should not be more than $5 and a few of the appetizers should be a couple bucks less.",

    "text": "Had high expectations for this place, but left really bummed out.   My family and I initially were set on another Italian place, but we left since the hostess said it would be a 45 to an hour wait without a reservation. Since we already had our hearts set on Italian food, we decided to go to mastrioni's since it seemed to have good reviews. We got there and , to our delight, were seated immediately. Service was prompt and decent, but the food was realllllly blah.   For starters we had the combo oreganate. It had baked scallops, shrimp, mussels, and clams stuffed with breaking. It was okay at best. The sauce was bland, and the whole thing just lacked flavor. My son and I shared the chicken fettuccini Alfredo, and my husband had the lobster ravioli. The lobster ravioli was quite good-- sauce was light yet creamy, and there was a substantial amount of lobster in the dish (albeit a little overdone). Now the chicken Alfredo was an entirely different story. The pasta tasted like the dried pasta you get from the supermarket, and the sauce was no different. Seriously, it tasted just like canned/jar sauce! The chicken pieces did not have any seasoning and was very rubbery, and overall was just very unpleasant to eat. I normally scarf down my food and very rarely leave left overs, but I even surprised myself with how reluctant I was to take more than 5 bites of this dish. I feel like the taste of the food we ordered did not justify how much we had to pay for our meal.   Who knows, maybe Alfredo just isn't their specialty, or maybe the chef was a just bit light handed with the seasoning tonight. Since it is an Italian and seafood place, maybe they just specialize more on the seafood, and not so much the pasta. Many thoughts come to mind as to why our experience was less than stellar, but will give them the benefit of the doubt for now.",

A buddy of mine that's Italian and from New York told me that this was the place to eat some real Italian food so of course knowing where he is from I took his word for it. Definitely delicious and we'll worth the cost. We had the shrimp cocktail, beef carpaccio, spaghetti and meatballs and the rigatoni pasta with meat sauce, and cheese cake of course.   I tried everything we ordered and loved everything but the beef carpaccio. The shrimp were fresh and huge, loved the horseradish it came with. The beef carpaccio was Ok,  I have had better. The spaghetti and meatballs and that was awesome, the meatballs were tender and juicy.  I absolutely loved my rigatoni pasta though, it was full of flavor and the portion size was huge!! The cheesecake is made in house and was amazing!   I have never had authentic Italian food that i know of (lol) but i wohld think that this was because of how fantastic it was!! Service was excellent and fast!! Definitely one of my new favorite spots!!",

He was super friendly, understood our east coast sense of humor and made great recommendations. This is the type of place where you can tell the servers love what they do, are well trained, know the menu and have experience. Or at least this is the impression Kurt left. I can't really speak for the other servers.We had 4 kids with us and he was super patient as well.   We ordered calamari and cheese salad as apps which were both delicious. Calamari tasted fresh with a crispy breading and tender inside, not chewy at all. Sauce was really good. For meals our table tried ziti, raviolis, meatballs, scallops, and I had the Linguini and clams in a white sauce. Absolutely delicious with a huge amount of clams. Most places tend to be stingy with the clams. I forced myself to eat every bite, as i did not want to waste any and bringing it home wasn't an option last night. The baked ziti was like what I'm used to back east that most Italian restaurants can't get right in Vegas. This place is the real deal. I tasted the scallops and they also tasted fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try the eggplant parm. I was reluctant to try it on my first visit, as I like a traditional fried, layered and baked and have not found a restaurant in town that does it the way they do in New York and Jersey. Kurt promised I'd like it, so I will be back to try that.  For dessert, we tried the tiramisu, cheesecake and kids had gelato. The tiramisu was on point. Tasted homemade and fresh! I don't really like cheesecake but this was excellent. Again, tasted very fresh and homemade. I failed to mention sooner, it's a very comfortable nice looking restaurant with a good atmosphere. The bar area looks very nice as well. It's a good sized place with enough room for several large tables, but small enough to feel cozy, like a neighborhood family owned restaurant.",

We were bowled over by the Clams Oregenata...first that a place in Vegas had them, and second that they were so delicious!! The calamari was terrific as well.  The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five was I felt the drinks were a bit over priced...$10 or $11 for a well vodka and soda was out of line, otherwise a great dining experience.",

Start with the Mastrioni's salad and you can't go wrong! Ask them to split it when you order, it's enough for two people.  An amazing salad with Gorgonzola, walnuts, pears, cranberries and vinaigrette dressing. Mussels with red sauce are excellent and I highly recommend the seafood linguine combo. The special on one visit was linguine with clams, mussels and shrimp in a red sauce. Excellent! The shrimp are huge and fresh! Service is attentive.",

I had thought this was a cafe since i have driven by it but it turns out to be a a little more upscale than thatt. The decor is modern and trendy. They start you off with hot french bread dipped in oil and balsamic vinegar. I had the house salad which was not worth the $8 price tag. There was no meat, just field greens, tomatoes, onions and dressing. My bf had the spaghetti with meatballs which the sauce was extremely runny with no flavor. The rigatoni bolognese and theseafood pasta with vodka sauce looked like much better options.",

The server, however was great, he was fun, full of info about the food, and business of the restaurant, and very attentive.....until the end.   The place looked clean, tables were set nicely....but the food ? \"Meh\"  I've had better Italian at a Pizzeria.  The pasta was undercooked, the raviolis were frozen, the sauce was very bland, (canned?).  The price of the food did not match the quality at all, high priced for frozen and canned.  At the very end we were left sitting and waiting, .....and waiting for the server to come back to our table to take the check and then to return with the receipt...that process took 20 minutes all by it's self....made us feel like we were just not very important at all...Not acceptable...We will not go back, and we are sorry we spent over $80.00 for dinner for 2 there.

The last couple times I went I was less than impressed. On my last visit our server disappeared half way through our meal and we were told by the next server that his shift had ended. Never came to let us know, thanked us, etc. just took off. Never seen anything like that before. The pasta was ok, I honestly have made better at home. I feel the food and the service both have gone downhill and I definitely won't be rushing back here again.

    "text": "Been a few years since I've been by, but they're going strong. Busy Saturday night was bustling and very nice. The kitchen does seem to take awhile - so try not to fill up on bread, lol.   Caesar salad pretty good. The bits of anchovy are optional, and ideally, I like to be entrusted with the whole fish. Still, it's better with than without.   The tomato basil soup is good and very rich. I like it, though I think it sets the tone for a heavier meal.  The pasta fagioli wins a less-complicated endorsement.   Entrees: I tried and loved a mushroom risotto with bay scallops. Crimini and more mushrooms were good, not overwhelming at all. The risotto was perfectly cooked (though not very hot temperature-wise), and the scallops were delicious. Orbs of oceaniac joy are beached atop the risotto.  Desserts: Let's definitely talk cannoli. Hard shell, good crunch with perfect ricotta filling and stuffed with chocolate almost-chips. Better than chips.  Party also had and enjoyed the tiramisu, but I was otherwise engaged, and will simply have to take their word for it.  Hats off to the servers, who do a great job. Loved that the Front Waiter steered me in the direction of a wine I wanted -- not the one he might have necessarily wanted to sell. Cheapest of the Sauvignon Blanc, and it was delicious (Sea Glass from Santa Barbara).  Call ahead for the busier nights and times, if this recent Saturday night is any indication.",

I wouldn't necessarily say it's neighborhood pricing but the portions and quality match the price and then some. Entrees range from about $17-$25 on average with meats a little pricier. Appetizers are really expensive in the $15-$20 range but are larger, family style offerings.   We had a chicken Parmesan and a seafood penne with vodka sauce. We also had a bottle of wine for a great price and the caprese. The caprese was enormous and easily shareable - a nice starter. We ordered our entrees extra extra spicy and the chef did not disappoint. The sauces had some type of pepper that really burnt the lips - perfection. The dishes themselves were fantastic for entrees and the spice level was perfect. Props to the chef for delivering on spiciness as we hoped for.   Mastrioni's has takeout options as well as a nice dining area with a bar and a few tvs. Staff is great and alcohol prices are very fair. Open for lunch and dinner, this place is a great local Italian option in Summerlin for a meal.",

It is fantastic, beside lobster in the ravioli there are lobster chunks in the sauce. Can't wait to return here. It's a neighborhood gem. I will be requesting to sit in Kurt's section again because he the made the experience that much more better.",

We love Italian but we where a bit disappointed . Not going to lie I'll come here again and will give it another shot .",

Chef Shawn is a master at what he does and the Cioppino or the Boullibasse are 2 items not to be missed. Easily the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm knocking this restaurant down a star after a few more meals here since my last posting. The latest meal here was just so-so. My Palm salad was over-dressed....drenched....in oil and whatever else was in the salad dressing.  My veal Milanese was pretty good but the side of penne with marinara was terrible. Store bought pasta, for sure, cooked to a gummy, mushy texture that no serious chef would allow out of the kitchen. Awful.   Another irritation at Mastrioni's is that when you arrive at the appointed time for your reservation...or early...or late, the hostess always, every time, says, \"it will be a few minutes.\"  Even when the restaurant has plenty of open tables and waiters standing around looking bored.  The hostess has you wait, maybe two minutes, maybe ten, before you are seated. Why do they do this?....it's NOT something fine restaurants do. The hostess also gives off a distinctly unfriendly aura.   One other specific complaint: when I sat down at the table on my most recent visit, the bread plate had a half used Tic Tac stuck to the plate. Disgusting, only made worse when the Seater said it looked like a tooth.    Lots of diners there in shorts and t-shirts.....really diminishes what is positioned to be a fine dining establishment.  One final complaint.  Mastrioni's should allow reservations via Open Table. Calling for reservations in this day and age is old school and annoying.",

Upon arrival we were greeted by our waiter Kurt who was professional, attentive and knowledgeable. I had the linguine vongole (clams), and it was excellent. Pasta was perfectly al dente, broth had just the right amount of spice and clams were fresh. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs. Even though not a True Italian dish, (you'll never find pasta with meat balls in Italy, unless you're in a tourist spot frequented by American tourists), the meatballs were awesome, and the sauce tasted like it was made at home. The ambience of the place is great, and we really enjoyed our lunch. Needless to say, were are going to be regulars. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu.",

    "text": "Excellent meal for our anniversary. I would describe Mastrioni's as an upscale version of your typical family Italian joint. They have typical preparations like piccata and marsala with higher end ingredients like veal, salmon and seabass. They have classics like pasta and meatballs and alfredo so if you want the classics they'll have something you can sink your teeth into.  That said they have a very nice contemporary and comfortable restaurant. The night we were there we saw prom goers dressed in tuxedos and dresses as well as the well healed and well dressed crowd of Summerlin. You would feel comfortable there in slacks and a button down shirt or even nice jeans. You may feel self conscious in golf shorts and a t-shirt.  The food was tasty and there was plenty of it. We shared the crab cakes which came out in a pair and could have been an entree they were so big. They had a nice balance of lump crab and not a lot of filler.   My wife had the shrimp and scallop penne with vodka sauce. That's a creamy tomato based sauce. She loved the fact that they had taken the tail off of the shrimp. Both of us shake our heads at shrimp tail shells. Take them off restaurant people!  I had a side of fettuccine alfredo and my main course was veal marsala. The veal was tender and came in a nice sauce that wasn't too thick. There were four  large cutlets and the typical mushrooms. The alfredo was creamy and decadent with shards of fresh parmesan on top. It was well seasoned and just what I was craving.  Unlike a lot of casual Italian restaurants, Mastrioni's has a nice wine list. There are plenty of wine by the glass choices and prices are more reasonable then the strip so drink up.  We were so full we passed on desserts, but a few chocolaty gooey things went by that we might need to try on another visit!",

Note we moved over one whole table   About 20 minutes later and lots of empty tables still the party who's table that he supposed sat us at partially arrives. Less than 5 minutes later they did not like that table so they moved to another.   REALLY. WHAT THE HELL!   Sorry bad move bad service your ass should be canned.

Ambience is very nice, however, why does every restaurant, even a really nice one like this, have to have the big screen TV with the sports on? Seriously folks, can't we take a break one night from Sports and go to have a nice drink or a nice dinner?  Back to the food, I got the shrimp fracase and my daughter got the chicken piccata. Grandson got fettuccine Alfredo off the kids menu. All very good and I'm trying to post pictures.",

My hubby was jonesing for some pasta, I thought this would be perfect! The pics and reviews on Yelp were favorable, so I thought.. So, I may have had an extensive order, but the hostess repeated everything correctly, so I thought we'd be good. I ordered two appetizers, garlic bread and crab cakes. One fettuccine Alfredo, lobster ravioli, veal Parmesan, and baked ziti.. first of all, we immediately took everything out of the bag upon our return home to find that our $20 crab cake app was missing.. I called the restaurant and the gal (Stephanie) apologized. I'm sorry, but a simple sorry doesn't cut it. I told her we'd be right back to pick it up.. My husband went inside after driving all the way back and she didn't offer anything for her mistake, not even an apology to him. He mentioned having to drive another almost 10 mile round trip back and she said he could get a free crab cake next time we dine in. Hmmmm thanks. My husband tipped this girl to simply place our food in a bag, but that couldn't even be done correctly.. So, 15-20 minutes later we get back to the house... all of the dinners are basically lukewarm by now. The garlic bread was inedible. I tried one piece and practically broke my tooth it was so overdone. The lobster ravioli was ok..it was packed kinda weird...the meat was cold and separate from the ravioli and sauce..it was also very fishy. The veal parm was pretty good, I'll give be them that.. the fettuccine Alfredo was not great..it was basically buttery noodles, not an Alfredo by any means... the baked ziti was probably the most basic yet decent dish we ordered. I may give them another chance, we do have the crab cake credit to redeem...but it won't be anytime soon...",

She seated that party and then everything stopped while the waiting area completely filled up. There were plenty of open tables but for some reason she wouldn't seat parties unless everyone was there. Even the full parties didn't get seated while she stared endlessly at the seating chart as if in a trance.   Except for one group that walked in and she immediately kissed them and whisked them past the huge throng to their table! Pissing everyone else off.   She assured everyone that their tables were available and being held but inexplicably wouldn't proceed with seating. Is this Outback? Even Outback is more efficient. The food was pretty good with a few missteps. Carpaccio special was excellent as was the Boston chowder. Clam pasta was gritty with the clams obviously not being cleaned thoroughly.  So sad that by time we were seated we were irritated and cranky. How could any restaurant overcome that start?",

I was really looking forward to trying the lobster ravioli and even though it's not on the regular menu they were still able to make it for me. Maybe they shouldn't have because it was such a let down to be honest. From the pictures from other people's reviews it looks so fresh and yummy with a decent amount of lobster. The tiny bit of lobster that was on mine was dry and tasteless and the portion was way too small for the price. It was also kinda bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Alfredo and his pasta was undercooked and gummy and my mom's grilled chicken was dried out. We did make a reservation since it's a Saturday and they gave us a nice table with no wait even though we were a couple mins early. Our waiter wasn't super friendly...he provided decent service though. For $100 I think we could have had a better meal and experience elsewhere so I probably won't be back.",

Our waiter Justin said it would be the best according to Chef and it was!!! Perfectly cooked, seasoned almost perfect ( I would have added Kalamata Olives ) pasta that was paired with it was perfect.  Portion was on point.   Now back to the appetizer, a very fresh calamari with broccoli rabe and peppers, tomatoes and potatoes in a beautiful sauce.  I don't even eat octopus anymore because I discovered it was very intelligent so I made a conscious effort to stop eating them however I may have to eat that calamari once a month along with the osso bucco. The Tiramisu was great just a bit soggy/juicy for me but great!  This place is as good as any place on the strip for Italian food. I was so impressed went and shook the Chefs hand after meal well done. Gordon Ramsay would be proud and not have much to say except \"Brilliant and clearly passionate about your restaurant\"",

This is a great community place for couples and families to enjoy. I ordered the Seabass blackened. The Seabass was prepared perfectly, broiled and lightly rubbed with Cajun spices. I went with the Penne marinara as my side option, it was a little bland, but a pinch of salt made it a decent side. Everyone at my table was very happy with their meal, which would not have been complete without a few glasses of wine.  Overall, I enjoyed dining here, it was very relaxing and a perfect place to enjoy good food and conversation with friends and family.",

If you are getting food to go make sure the waiter shows you that you got everything you ordered. Two of the last three visits I've been missing an entree and that's very frustrating. We don't live nearby so that means at least 30 min or more to drive back and have it prepared.   If you're wondering why I didn't check myself this time, there was no list of items attached to the bags and it was tight quarters at the bar. I had given the waiter a $40 tip on a to go order and surprisingly he wasn't the one who presented the 3 bags with the items in it. The gal who gave it to me had no idea what was inside and unpacking at that point would have been difficult so I trusted them. Mistake.   Bottom line, I didn't get to have dinner with my elderly parents and my family as I didn't want their food to go cold. Waiters, you have one job, please do it. The kitchen staff works their butts off there (and they don't get the tips) and does great work.   I'll go back because I really like the place but I'll be wary.",

I had the shrimp & scallop in vodka sauce. It was pretty good but the pasta was a little too al dente for me. And then there was barely any sauce. I think if there would've been more of a creamy sauce that would've made it better. He had the Osso Buco. He said it was pretty good as well. I guess both of the entrees were pretty good but not excellent are over the top. For dessert, we had some delicious  creme brulee! That was very tasty and perfectly done. I also had 2 martinis, one LemonDrop & a very berry one! He had some wine. The drinks were strong and came right away so that part was good.

    "text": "THIS. PLACE. IS. ACTUALLY. SO. GOOD. I was a little skeptical at first. I was going with a group of friends to this place and I wasn't really feeling like eating Italian. The wait was a little long, but I didn't mind because they gave us fresh bread with balsamic vinegar (Which was so delicious we had to get another order). I ordered the chicken parm which did not disappoint. I recommend ordering it with pasta (of course), but I made the most crucial mistake by ordering a side of spinach so I didn't have anything to eat the chicken with. I still ate it though cause it was that good. The food was so perfectly seasoned. Usually Italian restaurants are pretty salty for me, but this was so perfectly seasoned I was in heaven. I tried my friends spaghetti, and I realized at that moment that I was so jealous of her. The spaghetti was heavenly. The noodles were indescribable. The meatballs were the best part. Although they were a little more salty than the rest of the food we ordered, the flavors were such a great combination. I basically ate my friends dish for her. Anyways hope this helped!",

Also since when is a house wine $13 a glass during lunchtime?  We usually get a bottle for dinner for $35.  Was shocked to see a $26 charge for my two very small pours of wine.

I was glad that I had called earlier in the day to make my reservations. We started with the Fried Calamari, it was good, not great, but was prepared well and was fresh. Our Entrees, on the other hand, were great! My husband had the Osso Bucco. This was so good! Fall of the bone tender, flavor for days with a delicious 'gravy' over linguini. My Entree was on the guidance of our waiter, Kurt. I told him I wanted spaghetti, that spaghetti is one of my favorite foods and I  was hoping their version would \"wow\" me. Kurt suggested I get the Spaghetti with Meatballs, substitute the marinara for the bolognese and get it spicy. He said a lot of their \"regulars\" order it like this....... He was right on point, one of the best spaghetti dinners I have ever had!",

($8) There was not one single piece of pasta in it. Hmmm...what a misnomer? Regardless, it was hot and flavorful. Hubby had linguini and clams. ($22) I had a shrimp and scallop vodka pasta. ($26) My pasta was cooked perfectly and it was nicely seasoned. Very good. My pet peeve, happens all the time, is that I had to dig my fingers into my pasta with red sauce, while wearing white, to surgically remove the tails from my shrimp. It is not appropriate. The customer should not have to do the food prep on this. Remove tails. My girlfriend ordered sea bass ($35). It was totally mushy and improperly thawed. She did say the spinach was tasty though.   Our dirty dishes sat on the table for the entire meal. We asked multiple times for bread. We never got more water. Our server never checked on us and our food. Service was poor.   The price point makes no sense for a neighborhood Italian place.   Expect tasty food but expect to pay more than it's worth. Maybe service was a fluke. The table next to us was equally as irked. They cancelled their food and were visibly upset with the server.   Needless to say, I won't return.",

Right away, we were given fresh bread and our drink order was taken.  Our waiter came right behind to state the specials, one of which I ordered which was Osso Bucco with lamb.  Our appetizers were excellent, I had a bruchetta with very thick toast while the wife had the 3 tomatoes/mozzarella plate that was so fresh it was like cream. My wife's entree was a shrimp alfredo with very fresh shrimp and perfectly cooked pasta.  My lamb was falling off the bone as it was so tender and juicy.  We were full but I had to try the creme brulee which was outstanding, again just a soft texture.  The atmosphere is light and not stuffy, plenty of staff working to handle the rush and there is a bar with several televisions which had the basketball/hockey playoffs on.  Unlike a lot of restaurants in Vegas that charge high prices, the total for our dinner including tip was only $165.00 which also included an alcoholic drink for each of us plus a glass of wine.  I also ordered a slice of cheesecake to take home for our babysitter.  There are many restaurants in Vegas but this is one not to be missed.  We will be back and wholly recommend to anyone.",

As always, the wait staff was impeccable and in spite of the chef not being present since it was his night off, the kitchen staff performed seamlessly in concert.  My husband and I enjoy the friendly neighborhood vibe combined with professional service and delicious food.  I gave it 5 stars this time because after dining here weekly for 3 years I have never had a bad dish and almost always, the food is great.  It is one of the shining stars for locals and the Summerlin restaurant scene.",

All the staff is very detail oriented and makes sure you have the best experience possible. Kurt is one waiter who stands out and always makes our dinning the best. Kurt has a very likable personality and never lets us down. I would recommend this establishment to everyone who wants excellent food, welcoming environment and awesome service.",

The pinot noir from Sonoma County has a great body and aftertaste.   I tried my girlfriend's chicken parm and realized that it was, too, probably the best I've had.   If you're near the red Rock, come to this place.",

Still, the baked clams (oreganate, whatever that means) and eggplant parmigiana were both amazing and the service was good.  And they serve red wine at the correct temperature (slightly chilled).  Amazing!  Interesting dessert options that I did not get to try.  Roasted banana gelato, for example, sounded yummy but we were just too full from the fried food.  Full liquor license but I didn't see an actual bar.  There is a bar that overlooks the kitchen but I couldn't figure out where the alcohol was coming from.  The hostess looked like she wanted to kill me in my sleep, though.  That was a little awkward.  Still, a good neighborhood joint.",

The waiting staff was attentive and did well for such a large party. The food was delicious! I had the veal Marsala and their Marsala wine sauce was perfection. We had a few separate checks and the waiter maid it so easy and seamless for my guests! Thank you to the great staff for making my birthday dinner so memorable & fun! Will definitely be back!",

The music was classical, and set the tone for an overall good night. The wait staff was amazing and very sincere, one of the waiter always apologized for interrupting our dinner for simple drink refills. Our main waiter was very personable an was able to answer our questions, and make suggestions as well.  The food was delicious was served hot and fresh. We ordered just dinner, and desserts. Before we had even ordered food they brought out oil & vinegar, and warm bread. That was delicious, for our main courses we ordered chicken parmigiana, and eggplant parmigiana. The food came rather quickly, both came with a side of penne pasta and sauce, surprisingly it was quiet on a Wednesday night. Usually packed on the weekends. The eggplant was to die for, wasn't to bitter or to sweet, and very well coated in breading and cheeses. The chicken was perfectly browned and crispy around the edges, but soft and juicy inside.   Then came dessert we ordered the cannolis, and the cheesecake. The cannolis looked amazing overflowing with filling and covered in chocolate chips & chocolate sauce. The Cheesecake was absolutely amazing one of the best I've had. It was very rich, creamy, and had a hint of lemon. It usually comes with a berry puree but I ordered plain due to an allergy.   All in all it was a great night with great food. We will be back with out a doubt!",

Caesar salad with whole anchovies filets that melt like butter. Walk in and smell the butter, garlic, wine, salt...every single experience and bite is 5 star.

I can't remember our waiter's name, very New York accent (we're from R.I.) but he was fast. Our drinks were full and he checked every so often on us. Even everyone else that worked there seemed like polite. I felt valued bringing our business here.  We were dressed up for our 11th anniversary and our waiter made it very special and all the other staff that stopped at our table. I went with their Chicken Parmesan, it was homemade and delicious. I honestly was surprised how reasonable pricing was for some of these amazing dishes and their special sounded amazing Lobster Ravioli.   Dessert was a hard choice I went with a Cannoli and it was awesome. I had one at dinner and boxed the second to have tomorrow they're a good size portion. It was much better the next day even. I like them on the soft side and to their defense it is homemade everyday.  Anywhere from $15-30 for entrees and desserts were $10.  Way better than any chain and right in our neighborhood. I have no choice but to come back, I'm a tiramisu snob and I'd like to try it! ;) This is much quieter during the week so I'll be back.  I'm Portuguese but happen to love Italian food growing up 5 miles from Federal Hill (West Providence, Rhode Island).",

My partner and I were seated and given complimentary bread with vinaigrette. For being free, the bread pretty good and was served warm.   We ordered 2 pastas and 1 entree. The veal parmigiana came with 3 breaded pieces of veal with melted cheese on top and covered with tomato sauce. I feel like as an entree by itself, this would not fill me up since the pieces of veal are pretty thin.   The Fettuccini Alfredo was pretty good. The sauce was standard to other Alfredo's I've had, but it definitely lacked some acidity, pepper, or brightness and was just a bit too creamy and one dimensional for me. I actually added the veal parmigiana to this dish which made it so much better. I did really like the al dente way the pasta was made.   The Penne Chicken Mushroom and Sun Dried Tomato was my Absolute Favorite of the night!! Not only was the sauce super delicious, well balanced (some creamy/acidity), but it came with a larger sized portion that was much more filling as an entree especially with the generous amount of chicken it came with. The sauce was so yummy I kept making comments about it. All in all, everything was delish and the service was 5 stars!",

We got there a little early and still seated us.  It was very busy but the service was great. The waiter came right over and got us started on our wine. We ordered the Caprese salad and the salad came right out. It was huge and since I am allergic to peppers they added extra tomato, very nice.  The bf ordered the seafood special pasta and I ordered the John Dory. The food came out pretty quickly and the portions were huge. The John Dory was so delicious. It came with sun dried tomatoes, artichokes and a side of spinach. I also ordered a side of pasta and that was also very good. The seafood special was insane. It had so much seafood on top. Tons of scallops, 2 lobster tails, mussels, shrimp. They were not stingy with the seafood. There was so much, he took it home and had it again for lunch.  The dessert menu looked amazing but we were so full from dinner. We will def. be going back to Mastrioni's for dinner again.",

    "text": "On a mission to find monster meatballs and pasta to satisfy my italian craving, i eagerly scouted the assistance of old faithful YELP.   After a few minutes i narrowed it down to a few locations (primarily targeted by distance) and proceeded to make a final call. The deciding factor? 2 things. A picture submitted by a fellow yelper showcasing a beautifully crafted, softball-sized meatball & a picture depicting the interior of the restaurant, Mastrioni's.  And boy am I grateful for YELP and it's users' pics. I admit i wasnt sure what to expect. Mostly positive reviews, a picture that resembled a half way decent restaurant, and a close proximity to home drove my willingness to explore new found culinary options.  Mastrioni's did NOT disappoint. From the moment i walked in, i was impressed. The decor, the lighting, the ambiance, the welcoming faces. It all screamed authentic italian dining experience.  Food was I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E. I love me some italian food. Im not a professional food critic. But i do love food. And i do love to eat a delicious meal. And i will now be a repeating regular here at Mastrioni's whenever im in town. The Chicken Parmigiana is HIGHLY recommended. It's my favorite italian dish and this restaurant does a fabulous job on a staple meal. The meatballs, oh the meatballs. A mountain of meat easily the size of a softball is moist, flavorful and cooked to perfection. I ordered 2 on the side and didnt even make it to the 2nd. The portions are pretty big so bring ur stretchy pants and appetite. You're gonna need em....both.   Service 9 Food 9 Atmosphere 9 Overall 9  Recommended: HIGHLY",

My husband had Linguini with Sausage and again the main impression was that it was a bit bland; mild sausage. The rest of the party had basically the same opinion with their pasta dishes (spaghetti and ravioli). Taste, texture and serving size all okay. Service was good.",

    "text": "Delicious Italian food!  This is an excellent option if you want to dine off of the Vegas Strip; it's a bit more relaxing and low key.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees and shared family style.  My favorite dish had to be the lobster ravioli... it was smothered in a delicious white cream sauce and filled with succulent lobster chunks!  I also loved the grilled sea bass... the toasty grilled flavor was slight but what stood out the most was the tender flakiness of the fish.  Perfection.  The accompanying bed of sauteed spinach tasted wonderful with a squeeze of lemon juice.  Clam linguine was alright-- the pasta was al dente, and the sauce was quite light.  The clams were of a generous size, and it was quite convenient having the small seafood fork to remove the meat from the shell.  The crab cakes were a bit dry.  Perhaps they deep fried it for too long?  It wasn't moist.  Also loved the tomato bisque-- it was served very hot, and stayed hot for awhile!  The creaminess of the soup balanced out the acidic tomato taste.  Very good combination.    Expect the seafood entrees to run around $30-35.  The appetizers run anywhere from $8-15.  We were here for quite awhile... and I noticed that the longer we took to eat, the slower the service got LOL.  So slow, that when we wanted to order dessert, it took FOREVER for them to come back, until we finally just said we'll have to pass on dessert.  We had a show in downtown LV to catch!",

The ambiance of the place is great, the service was attentive and quick, and food was tasty!  We were sat and quickly received bread with oil and vinegar. The wine list was great and my wine quickly came out with a generous pour. No complaints here! For an appetizer, I ordered a greek salad and also had the stuffed clams for the table. The greek salad was really great and the clams were sinfully good. I recommend dipping the bread in the clam sauce, just a hint from a fellow foodie ;).   I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree and told them to make it extra saucy. It came out extra saucy for sure! Their red sauce is really tasty with just the right amount of spicy. The meatballs were huge, but could have used a little more salt or flavor. When I cut a meatball open, I like to see herbs and spices and there was only meat in these. But the entree was good and I would order it again.   My husband got the chicken parm which he orders anytime he sees it on the menu. He said that the chicken parm was really good, but not the best. However, from a chicken parm expert, a \"really good\" is saying something!  We will be back for sure.",

On the Sunday night we were there it was surprisingly busy with most of their tables full by 7pm.  I got one of their specials, a seafood risotto ($30) full of squid, scallops, mussels, and shrimp. There was rarely a bite without seafood. Unfortunately, it was bland and forced me to do what I rarely do in any restaurant -- reach for the salt shaker. I had to use it several times to liven up the dish. The portion size was huge, but it also lacked the creaminess of a great risotto.  If you're a fan of chicken parmagiana, the one here is bound to please with a zesty and full bodied sauce. I can't remember having a better version anywhere in town. It was accompanied by a huge side of spaghetti, which made for some great left overs the next day.  They do have a kid's menu with a few pasta options.  3.5 Stars",

Make sure to get red and highly recommend the hottest they can make it. Its not overly spicy and it does not cancel out the flavors.   Also make sure to get an order of their cream puffs they are amazing. Great menu, atmosphere, and service. Highly recommend it!",

For dinner, we ordered: eggplant parmesan (very good), 3 seafood and pasta dishes, ziti and meatballs, and shrimp parmesan. Everything was good, but nothing was great. Service was excellent though, which always makes a meal better. I'd definitely come back, I did enjoy myself.",

    "text": "I just recently heard of this restaurant and have only been there twice, but both times were amazing! Make sure to call ahead because the restaurant is not very big so it fills up fast! First time I got the eggplant Parmesan, which was amazing but huge! Which helped my decision to share the chicken Parmesan the second trip! Definitely recommend sharing both of those dishes and if you tell them you're sharing they'll even split it for you ahead of time. For appetizer we had the crab cakes which were delicious. Crab cakes are my favorite appetizer so I order them at almost every restaurant I go to that offers them and these are definitely on the top of my list. I also had a bite of my friend's halibut which was also very delicious and the portion was more reasonable for one person. And last, but definitely not least... the dessert! I am not a big tiramisu person, not that I dislike it's just not my first pick on a dessert menu, but we were told it was a must try and it definitely was! By far the best tiramisu I've ever had! I love that the kitchen is in place of the bar, I think it makes the entire experience more personable when the chefs and the owner introduce themselves and you get to watch them prepare your dinner. It is the perfect place for a date night as it is classy but not one of those overly fancy places that make people like me feel awkward and out of place! LOL! Overall, the service, food and atmosphere are all perfect!",

Decided to go on a whim for my Mother's birthday after she asked for \"hole in the wall\" Italian. Well, there's nothing \"hole in the wall\" about Mastrioni's... it's a classy little joint in a non-descript strip mall on Hualapai. We have a two year old, which is the main reason we haven't been here sooner since it's not really a \"kid-friendly\" spot,  but I figured a Wednesday night would probably be slow and safe. Not so much. By 7 o'clock this place was jam packed! Thankfully, the little criminal behaved wonderfully and we got to enjoy one of the better Italian dinners we've had in a long time. We had calamari and crab cakes for appetizers, calamari was good but the crab cakes were excellent. Mom had the bone in rib-eye, hubs had the seafood linguine and I had linguine and clams. This is your tried and True Italian, better than probably any other I've had in Vegas and would rival any of my favorite spots in California. I'd say it's more like $$$, but they are very generous with the portions/seafood. Dessert was excellent as well and service was on point. We will definitely be back and will probably become our new date night spot.",

The ambiance is lovely and very conducive to visiting so perfect when leisurely is in order. Since the space is small, a strong smell of fish hits you at the entrance but becomes unnoticeable once in. The menu is diverse and offers many options. While I wanted to fall in love, I fell into hmmm...maybe...kinda sorta. Service was fine-hostesses were charming unlike many locations, and the sea bass piccata and summerlin salad were very nice. My companions were lukewarm about their salmon entrees as the darkness of the underside seemed to be a deterrent, but my main issue was the plating and lack of fullness for the price. The salad was $13 which is firm for what it was, but sea bass at $36 with a side of room temperature vegetables was too much. For $36-there should have been a small amount of roasted potatoes or such  and the presentation would have been better if the included vegetable side had been on the plate so the bass wasn't so lonely looking. Flavor was fine but in competing with the big boys at big boy prices-up the food presentation and include a carb side to fill out the plate as I am home now and snacked a bit after dining out.. and promise I'm not a giant :)",

Unusual for a place way off the strip, or for a place not located in Town Square or Boca Park.  We had a young lad serving us that was quite pleasant and efficient.  I ordered the house salad with balsamic dressing that was excellent.  My main dish was just a basic penne with meat sauce.  I thought it was very average.  The restroom was very clean.  The customers were well dressed. Young blonde hostess was nice.  I got kind of annoyed every time the front door to the place opened, a strong odor of cigarettes came in from the smokers outside.

    "text": "Last night, we went to dinner at Mastrioni's Cafe on Hualipai.  We were in a small group and were seated quickly by a caring and pleasant Hostess.  The ambiance of the restaurant is quite striking with art works displayed on the walls.  The kitchen is open and the smell of roasting garlic was wonderful to behold and hopefully a promise of the meal to come.  Sadly this wasn't what we experienced.  Dishes ordered included Caesars Salad  for 3 couples for sharing.  When they were delivered, the wait staff hadn't a clue as to how to serve each of the 6 plates to the 6 guests who were to receive them.  The salad consisted of limp wilted lettuce (Iceberg not Romaine?) with barely enough dressing to moisten the sad pile of greens below.  The salad was quite tasteless and a big disappointment.    It certainly was not worth the $10 cost. The bread that accompanied the salad was tasteless as well.  It was perhaps white bread toasted.  The server (or was it his assistant) put some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the plates in which to dip the bread.  The bread and the balsamic dip were gone in a few moments and never replenished.  Being a large group the members ordered a variety of entrees and represented a good cross section of menu selections.  I ordered Eggplant Parmagian that was accompanied by ziti in a tomato sauce.  (Or was it tomato water?) The ziti was cool not hot, the individual pieces of pasta were stuck to each other and quite gummy.  The sauce was runny and tasteless.  The Eggplant however was plentiful and tasty.  Unfortunately, the sauce on the eggplant was anything but plentiful and far from tasty.  There was barely enough to cover the food below.  My wife ordered a dish of bowtie pasta with broccoli.  It was warm (not hot) and quite tasteless.  Both of these dishes were, most assuredly, not worth the $18, $16 respectively.    in this town of plentiful eateries how this restaurant serving mediocre food at grossly inflated prices can survive especially with the current economy is a mystery.  Hopefully they will improve over time",

    "text": "I would rate this as a one more in a long line of mediocre (at best) Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. I dined with a medium sized group  and had a chance to sample several appatizers, entrees, and deserts; as well as hear comments and view the reactions to the food quality.   The evening started on an extremely low note and thankfully went up slightly as dinner progressed. The hostess that greeted us at the door was rude and discouraging, and the first person to greet us at our table was even worse- disheveled, rude, uninformed, and just plain insipid.  Thankfully he was just the assistant waiter or bus boy, and our regular waiter was much better (although in all seriousness, the bar was set VERY low). Our table started off with a variety of mixed drinks and appetizers, as well as the bread that was served  automatically. This was the absolute low point in the evening- the drinks were poorly made at best and took entirely to long to get to the table, two of the 3 loaves of bread brought to the table were stale and had to be replaced (even the second set didn't taste very good) and everything seemed to be a hassle to get. I put 100% of the blame on the assistant waiter. You have to understand this guy left you with the feeling of absolute incompetence.) Once the appetizers came, things picked up only slightly. If garlic and salt  sledge hammer flavors are your thing, this restaurant is for you. Of the several apps that I tasted, only the bruscetta was worth going back for, but I grudgingly give a nod to the steamers (white wine sauce and heavy garlic) and the crab cakes (very meaty but not much flavor... how?). Avloid the overcooked calamari and the absolutely boring ceaser salad (really, even a sports bar can get these right)  Dinner was thankfully better, but again the slovenly assistant waiter and overwhelming flavors marred a good, if basic, Italian meal. Of all the meals I sampled, nothing actually stood out, but nothing actually tasted horrible either-  just mediocre and overwhelmingly seasoned.   The veal chop I ordered was tender and very buttery in texture, and everyone that tried the roasted potatoes was in love. My partner was absolutely disappointed in her dish, unfortunately neither of us remember what it was exactly (a pasta with spinach and chicken) Everyone else seemed satisfied but never wowed by their food, and only two plates went back clean- two plates everyone at the table heavily partook of- the veal chop and a mixed seafood pasta   Desert and the wines served with dinner were the highlight of the evening. I ordered a house Chianti that was very good for the price, and several  others at the table shared a bottle of Chardonay. The regular wine connoisseurs at the table seemed very pleased w/ the wine selection.   As for desert I was once again able to sample several thing as well as take note of other peoples reactions. Several deserts were ordered and for the most part passed around. Of important note- the cheesecake (rich, dense and creamy but still light,  w/ a hint of lemon flavor) and espresso ice cream pie (very rich and creamy if slightly freezer brunt, but still one of  the table faves)  were most remarked upon and devoured in their entirety, while the tiramisu was almost completely ignored. I took a small bite and what can I say- flat, dead, dull...pointless? This is desert that every Italian restaurant should ace at, yet along with the several coffees and gelatos ordered, nobody had anything good to say about them (all of the coffee drinkers commented on an \"off\" taste)   So, to sum up- nothing horrible yet nothing stellar;  the service was OK in some ways but atrocious in others, the food was either serviceable or entirely forgettable, and the bar is a complete failure. Another completely mediocre Vegas Italian restaurant.  Will I go back? Never.",

There were two large shrimp and 4 clams and 4 mussels in their shell. Then the filler was tiny squid. All of this looked great, but I've never had such a poor dish. Either they forgot the wine in the white sauce or there was too much water in the pasta... I don't know which but the white sauce tasted like buttered water and nothing else. It was quite disappointing. And I was starving so just about everything should have tasted good, but after this dish, I have decided that I'm not trying it again. My son's spaghetti plus mine was $50 without gratuity... Sure the waiter agreed to make me something else, but if you have the most expensive pasta dish delivered without any taste... why would I want to try anything else...Not going back.",

Fresh crab and the cocktail sauce = money!  *Tomato Basil Soup - Another classic done perfecto.  Had a couple of great glasses of Chianti to accompany dinner.  We had to box up a few things and they wrapped everything very nicely- including the soup!  The leftovers were SO GOOD!  I wish I had room for dessert- hopefully next time.

You can't go wrong with the following: *Seafood Risotto (usually on the special list) FULL of succulent seafood and rice cooked to perfection. *Chicken Marsala- tender and flavorful *All of their delicious salads-especially the Summerlin salad *The veal  *Their pasta gravy  (almost as good as mine!)

The shrimp was cooked well but it tasted horrible. The calamari and mussels were bad too really fishy taste. I just went there tonight and will not be going back. I get that its vegas and there is no ocean here but this was laughable. The total check was 150 after tip @ 20 percent. The service was good and fast but goodness was the food awful.

It would have been nice to see a touch of innovation and use of more varied ingredients.   The service was subpar. Our server was what my wife called \"abrupt\". He seemed to come and go very rapidly without actually seeming to care about our dining experience. I got a beer and the chilled glass that came with it smelled (and made my beer taste) like bleach, so I requested a new one. The server poured a little bit in then basically slammed them on the table as he was already mid-stride to do something else. The second glass was similar so I drank out of the bottle after the initial bleachy-tasting pour was consumed. The waiter saw me sniffing at my glass again and just came by and collected the glass and took it away - not even asking if I had a repeat experience (which I did).   The wife got the Seabass PIcatta...it was an okay size piece and it was cooked well. The picatta sauce (lemon and capers) was entirely too lemony. Would not recommend the picatta.I wouldn't call it a $36 dollar dish either.   I heard Osso Bucco was one of the specials and I can never turn that down. It came out looking great atop fettuccini with a good sauce. The Osso Bucco itself was good but could have used a little more braising to make it more tender as the meat was a little firm. Overall it was below average comparatively. I was a bit surprised when I got the bill and it was $42.",

I think had he gone maybe med rare instead of raw  it probably would've tasted better .. the service was so so, we had cocktails after dinner , those were the best thing we had ... sorry to say we won't be returning ... I was really hoping this place would have worked out for us ... Oh well ... we'll just move on...",

There's always a debate between which appetizer to get, there are so many good ones! On nights likes tonight, when I am not feeling seafood, I order the bruschetta appetizer. The best bruschetta I have ever had. Ever. I usually do the clam oregenate, crab cakes, or seafood salad!  I had the Penne, Chicken, Mushroom, and Sun-dried tomatoes. It is probably my favorite pasta dish, of all time. I also really love their Penne, Shrimp and Scallop Vodka.   My friend chose the delicious Ribeye, cooked to a perfect medium rare. I kept stealing the parmesan potatoes that came with it.   For dessert, we shared a scrumptious slice of homemade cheesecake and Creme brulee. Because who can resist mouth-watering, fluffy, perfect cheesecake?!  Definitely a must try! They get busy on the weekends, but are usually good about quickly seating you. I still recommend making a reservation   They offer catering and have a room available for private parties, along with family style menu options for parties of 16+ guests   PS The food comes out fast, fresh, and hot!",

You get 3 pcs of thinly sliced veal with a side of pasta. Very good and juicy but same thing, just not filling. Would probably not come back just because it's to expensive.",

My personal favorite is the Veal Marsala, and calamari is consistently yummy. You can never go wrong with the Osso Bucco!

He was very helpful when we were deciding on an appetizer, but he made the creamy mozzarella cheese with heirloom tomatoes appetizer sound so enticing that we had to order it as well as our original idea, bruchetta.   My huband got the osso bucco which he really enjoyed. I got the seafood comno with angel hair rather than the linguini that comes with it by default with white sauce. I really enjoyed my dish, but towards the end it was harder to enjoy just because I was so full, haha. I want to come again to try out the other dishes and I am sure that everything else is just as delicious.",

When we entered we were told that they were not open until 4 The owner/Chef came over and explained that the kitchen staff was prepping for Dinner but welcomed us to stay for lunch. He personally provided outstanding and attentive service throughout our meal  The Restaurant was beautifully decorated for Christmas with Christmas music by Chris Botti softly playing in the background. Now for the Food. We started with crab cakes and steamed clams. The crab cakes were all about the crab and well seasoned while the clams were lightly cooked in a  delicious spicy broth. I couldn't resist dunking the warm bread.  We then opted for the Halibut and Seabass both served with a lemon butter sauce with capers. I am originally from NY and have lived in Brussels and London but have never had fish that was cooked better then what Mastrioni presented. The fish was succulent, moist and delicious with the sauce the perfect compliment. For dessert we shared a Tiramisu that was one of the best I have enjoyed. Overall this was an outstanding meal and a wonderful Christmas Eve dining experience. I highly recommend that you visit Mastrioni's and it too will be one of your new favorites in Vegas.",

The atmosphere is charming with a dash of chatter.   The excellent service is also paired with a delightful wine list but beware of the portions when choosing your food as the most dishes are fairly heavy. To start we got healthy portions of caprese and calamari to share; followed by veal marsala and fettuccine alfredo; topped off with cannolis.  Definitely will be back if in the area.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas visiting family and they told me that I NEED to try this place, so we decided to go there for a Sunday dinner. This place is new nice looking restaurant in a plaza with plenty of parking. We arrive around 5:00 PM and the place was pretty empty, but by 5:45 PM it was completely filled, so you might want to make reservations before going. The service at the restaurant is great, the staff is friendly and welcoming and seems like they will do their best to meet you needs, one person in the group tends to be really picky about things and the staff had zero problems with meeting his requests.  Anyways on to the food, we ordered a total of 4 dishes  Osso Buco served on Fettuccine (5/5 stars) - This item was one of the specials and it was one of the most amazing dishes I ever had, the meat was so soft and tender. it just fell off the bone.  They also provided a small fork so that you can get to the bone marrow or the bone.  it was a little pricey ($45), but well worth it! so I would still give this dish 5/5 stars. It is big enough to share, but DON'T! its too yummy.  1/2 Baked Lobster topped with crab meat, served with papperdelle with seafood sauce (4/5 Stars) - This was also one of the specials, it consisted of a a whole Maine lobster that was split in half, topped with crab meat. The pasta it came with was a seafood sauce that contained clams and shrimp.  All of the seafood was top notch and really fresh. This dish was really good, but didn't stand out as amazing to me. but still worth the $42 price tag.  King Crab Legs (4/5 Stars ) - This dish consisted of 6 mersus sections of the crab leg. which is the largest part of it between the body and the first joint. The Kitchen does most of the work and cracks the shell and the correct point so that you can pull the whole section of meat out without much effort.  The meat its self was VERY fresh, the meat was sweet and soft like it should be. Not dry and briny like a lot of places serve. It is hard to find crab of this quality in most places.  Overall though, don't get this dish if you are really hungry, it is not a lot food for most people, I would say split this as an appetizer. (i don't remember the price)  Cioppino (3.5 stars) - I should start by saying that I this is a dish that I always compare to the best cioppino i've ever had which is at Sotto Mare in San Francisco. This dish was good in terms of quantity and seafood quality. The pasta was also cooked perfectly.  But I felt the dish was a little watery over all, I prefer to have it be a little thicker.  The taste also wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped. This dish was just \"ok\" for me, I don't think I would order it in the future. The cost was $34 i think or maybe $32?  Overall, I really like this restaurant.  I have added it to my must eat at again list the next time I am in Vegas.  If you are looking for somewhere to eat away from the strip I strongly recommend this place, and if they have the Osso Buco get that!!!  I am basing my 5/5 rating mostly on the Osso Buco that I ordered as well as the service.  But from eating everything I don't think you will be dissappointed with anything you order",

Jazz music playing was an added bonus. It was fairly slow because we dined on a Monday, but even as it picked up they never sat people right on top of each other. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. Never allowed for us to be without water or have to flag them down. Our meals were the best Italian we've had in Vegas. We ordered classic spaghetti & meatballs and chicken parmigiana (bill $38 + tax and worth EVERY penny). Truly delightful with flavors, and reminiscent of home-cooked Italian food. It was hands down the best experience I've had OFF the strip. Typically, for this level of quality in every aspect I have to travel to the strip and mingle with tourist traffic, loudness, and hassle. I'm thrilled that I found it here, without valet, hiking into a loud smoke filled place, or having to travel 20 miles home to Summerlin after.

    "text": "One of my new favorite places to eat.   The service was excellent and so was the food. The restaurant itself is nice with very modern decor. I wasn't crazy thrilled about the music. It was very \"elevator type\". The jazzy kind that puts you right to sleep.   Other than that, our waiter was super attentive. A bit eccentric, but was very on top of his tables.   We had: Caesar salad. It was good, but it was pretty overpriced for how small it was. It was the size of a small side salad for $12.  The crab cocktail. Again, it was overpriced for how little of crab you get. It's maybe 1-2 full snow crab legs for $21. That's just silliness.   For the entrees - oddly enough, they're decently priced.  The Shrimp and Scallop Vodka Penne - very yummy. Would recommend on angel hair pasta.  Sea Bass Picatta - Mother, this was good. The Seabass just melts in your mouth...better than chocolate. I love any white fish with a good citrus butter sauce. So freaking excellent.   Overall, everything was good. We were super happy with our experience.",

    "text": "Woohoo! As good as it gets!!  How funny would it be if that was my whole review? But it's not, because I was so blown away by the food and service at Mastrioni's that I have a lot to say! First of all, my server was superb and so was everyone that helped him bring the food to my table. Our drinks were never empty once. I felt so well taken care of as a customer that I literally wrote on the receipt, which is something my mom would do! Garrett was our primary server. He was kind, quick, and attentive. He hit the perfect spot for service between over-bearing and just plain helpful.   I have to admit that I didn't think this would be such an excellent restaurant. I didn't look up the prices and based on the outside I expected it to be cheaper/faster than Olive Garden! I was certainly confused!! This place was pricey, like $30 a plate pricey. I should have paid more attention to the $$ on Yelp, but I just saw it had good reviews and went for it. Beyond the initial shock of looking at the menu, everything that accompanied was spectacular. It is mich bigger than it seems on the outside, the atmosphere is open and dim and perfect for a romantic date night. My boyfriend was in a T-Shirt so we weren't prepared for the romantic part but we were sure ready to eat.  I hate that I didn't take any pictures but I was so busy enjoying myself that the phone didn't get touched until desert. Those cream puffs, though. Yumm! If cream puffs are an obsession of yours as they are mine, you will be pleased. Working backwards, Eric had a shrimp parmigiana which was probably our least favorite thing. It was good but I wouldn't order it again with all the other delicious options. I had the seafood combo linguini with white sauce and it was amazing. The amount of seafood was everything I ever wanted, it was basically half seafood and half noodles. Normally I feel lucky if my seafood linguini comes with a few muscles - this one had that and scallops and octopus and all manner of seafood galore. We had the fried calamari for an appetizer which was great but not different than any other good calamari. We also split a Summerlin Salad made with arugula which is my favorite green. It came out already split, gotta appreciate that extra effort!  I drank a few glasses of moscato which may be messing with my ability to critique, but as of right now I just can't wait to go back to Mastrioni's! I just wish I knew how to pronounce it.",

We made reservations and arrived 10 minutes early.  It being Valentines's Day we knew that it would probably be a little bit crazy getting seated.  There was a little confusion and we waited a bit longer than expected but they were very quick to remedy the situation.  The service here is excellent. Our server was Vince and he was awesome. Super attentive and polite, couldn't ask for better :)   I ordered the chilean sea bass, bruchetta style...holy cow, it was amazing! Husband ordered the surge and turf, which he said was a little more charred than he would have preferred, but it was a ridiculously busy night for them, so we understand. When we brought it to their attention, again they were quick to remedy with a fabulous dessert. We picked the cheesecake (really really good), but since we devoured dinner there's wasn't anymore room and we took it home.    Very nice dinner for just the two of us or with a group of friends. High ceilings, big open room, small bar that you can order food at in the back. A little pricey, but worth it.  We'll definitely be back soon.",

The service is 5 star so the rating is for the food I thought I would try the old standard spaghetti and meatballs  the portion is huge with 2 softball size meatballs I was impressed with the plate of food set before me. Then I tasted it the sauce was nice and fresh but horribly sour being italian I know sour sauce. Then I cut into the meatball I saw no sign of onion or garlic or anything but meat it tasted like a round plain burger. Needless to say I was so let down. With a good italian name like that I was so underwealmed. This place could be the best italian restaurant in town but the chef needs to go back to basics a little sugar in the sauce and some sauteed garlic onion basil salt and pepper in the meatball you would have 5 star food to match your 5 star service. I will try them again but will probably get a steak until the red sauce improves",

    "text": "Impressions. \"I'm gonna make him an offer he won't refuse.\"  Ok, joking aside, I truly believe first impressions are important but don't tell the whole story.  This is one of those times. So here we go.    Walking up to this small strip mall storefront, I was wondering what I was getting myself into but my daughter insisted we eat close to Golden Spoon Yogurt so we could get a good desert.  So in we go.  The dark room reminded me of the Godfather so I started to get the Italian feel. \"Cenare\"  Being from back east, the first lesson I learned about Italian Restaurants is you can tell a good restaurant by the bread they serve you.  I will admit the west coast doesn't always follow that rule, maybe because few restaurants have the old brick ovens but I was disappointed in the bread served. You could get better bread at Vons.   My next impression, was the menu.  Everything looked good and the standard Italian fare (veal parmagiani, Pastas, etc) was broadened by seafood dishes.  The prices were much higher than I would expect from a strip mall store much to my disappointment.  (see below for part of the reason why).   I was here with my daughter and she ordered the Kids portion of the Penne Marinara.  I opted for spaghetti and meatballs as I didn't want to break the wallet and was craving comfort foods.  The specials sounded great (Lobster Ravioli and Seafood Risotto) but I went with the standard. After all, if an Italian place can't do Spaghetti and Meatballs right, well the rest of the dishes might as well be frozen dinners.   The penne was good, The kids sauce not too spicy but, and here is the pricing issue, the kids portion was enough for an adult.  The adult portion was huge.  The meatballs themselves looked like the Bull won. (Old off color joke, you can send me a private message if you don't get it.) Lets just say they were huge.  They were surprisingly light and flavorful if on the spicy side.  When I make meatballs or eat at some other restaurants, the meatballs are often too dense. These were perfect.  The Spaghetti on the other hand tasted a little overcooked and the sauce, although flavored with spiciness, lacked the garlic I hoped for and was a bit watery.  I usually finish my food but I was able to bring home one of the two meatballs and half the spaghetti and my daughter brought home more than 1/2 her meal.  The service here made this place stand out.  Our waiter was polite, informative about the specials, and attentive.  My drink never sat for more than a minute without him offering to refill the Coke or my daughter's lemonade. In fact, the busboy and another waiter also took time to make sure I was fine on the drinks.  I drink fast so that was a plus.  They brought us butter for the bread on request (otherwise you just get olive oil and balsamic). They also told us about deserts without trying to push them on us.  Overall, except for the price and the dichotomy between spicy and watery sauce, I ended up impressed.  If I could change one thing, I would make the portions 1/2 the size and cut the price by $5.00 but hey, they must do ok to maintain those prices in such a low traffic area.  Buon Appetito",

    "text": "first time i have been here after my girl heard great things about it and i realized its the restaurant for the billboard i have seen on the way home many times on the 215. we had the special app burrata cheese with tomatoes. it was good but not heirloom tomatoes really? rookie mistake..cheaper with reg tomatoes but mistake for sure...burrata is amazing though, can't lie...also had the crab cakes it was a big portion size however, not great flavor and needs some work. had the spagetti and meatballs for dinner, noodles were good but not home made, meatballs were a big portion but not as good as lavo...for dessert the espresso cake, 1 word WOW!!! it was amazing and would go back just for that. also love the off the strip prices, the bottle of wine which was a ruffino was $42 which was a steal. great service as well, can't remember his name at the time but super friendly and helpful.   great little feel inside the restaurant and will go back for that feeling. not the best food but will give it another try for sure. restaurant was packed on a tuesday night so clearly they are doing something right. seems like a local summerlin ritzy crowd. mostly old ppl and we were the only asians in the restaurant other than the ppl who were sat next to us. coincidence? not sure...haha",

    "text": "this honestly deserves 1 star but the entree saved it from being such.....3 of us go to lunch today, we sit down and the server comes and asks if theres going to be 2 more (table was set for 5, we originally were going to have 5 but ended up not), like 5-8 minutes go by before he comes back to offer us drinks, so we get drinks. Then he scurries away before we can even ask him about putting something in while we wait, comes back several minutes later and we ask him to put in the calamari...i heard good things about this place specifically the calamari, i love calamari so was really really looking forward to it.   We are snacking on bread and the oil/balsamic mix they give you, its OK...bread isnt anything to write home about...the calamari arrives low and behold it looks plain as can be, as in zero seasoning and quickly flash fried but i give it a shot nonetheless....anddddddd im spot on. $15 for AWFUL calamari, unbelievable. We thought about saying something but just let it go.  So we ordered another appetizer to go along with it, the garlic bread for a whopping $7.....what was it? It was the SAME BREAD they give you for free as much as you want, 5 tiny slices with a little garlic on top and baked....haha next time im bringing my own garlic and just eating it. Unreal.  Entrees made up for it, i ordered the salmon and the others ordered some kind of pasta which he raved about but its compared to the dog crap we were eating for the previous 45 minutes, so its hard to not be better than that. The salmon was ok, but again compared to what we were eating it was heavens grace.  Im definitely not planning a trip back any time soon and would not go out of my way for it, the ambiance inside is beautiful and the place is really really nice looking, but the food sucks.  oh and we were going to ask about the canoli but then we saw it was $10....unless that thing is stuffed with gold, im not paying $10 for a canoli",

There's really not much in Vegas for a nice sit down meal off the strip and that's why I think it gets all the high marks. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. But for the price I'd wayyyy rather Vitners grill or drive to the strip. I wouldn't avoid it.

I was hoping for some garlic flavor but there was little to be had in either the scampi or the mussels/clams. Nice Chianti!",

Very comfortable atmosphere, yet VERY nice; upscale seating but comfortable attire is a-ok (as we were in cute sweats and tanks). The front house, busser, waiter- EVERYONE very kind and warm.   We were never rushed, which we are used to so it was shocking when our waiter asked if we were ready to fire our entree- awesome!  The food is amazing, I've worked at high-end Italian and this place is just as good if not better. Very generous with the bread, we got the Key Lime Pie Martini(and a Peach Martini, she preferred the K.L.P) and Very Berry Martini- both were delicious.   House salads as appetizers, I got the balsamic which I found perfectly balanced. And I got the pasta with red sauce and sausage, my friend went a lil healthier and got pasta and broccoli, though her plate was good, well, mine was heaven. Even though we were stuffed (large portions) we got Cheesecake and the Tiramisu. Well, the tiramisu was light and fluffy- tasted like they had just made it, and the cheesecake was rich and yummy.   The plates average 15-18 (nicer meals like Veal is higher 25-30), price is fitting for the food, the bill was about $120- worth it!  This is the place for my pasta (or seafood) kick when I am visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Giving this place 3 stars is a lot for the experience that I had. Let me start by saying the food here is excellent! In addition the speed of service is also great. My complaint here is not the food so much as the ambiance and a specific server. I honestly wish I had kept the receipt with the servers name on it bc I couldn't tell you what it is. However I know he is an older man who wears his glasses around his neck. The experience I had with this server was terrible. I will start by saying he is very educated in the specials and the menu and was able to suggest many meals to us before we even opened the menu. However, when myself or anyone at my table asked about how a certain item is he just said it was great and almost seemed like he was annoyed. Now let me say, I am also a server and know sometimes tables can be annoying but obviously I work for tips and know that my guests spend a lot of money to come out to eat and I should show them great customer service. We began the meal by ordering the caprese salad which was on the pricey side it was $17 for about 4 pieces of buffalo cheese and about 5 tomatoes none the less it was delicious. Typically when the food is ordered the server will bring the oil and balsamic vinegar prior to or when the meal is delivered. This server didn't, which is fine everyone forgets things from time to time. What upset me was that when my 15 year old brother asked him for balsamic vinegar he asked for balsamic vinaigrette which he soon corrected himself. The server responded with \"I got it I know what you mean you're food just came out\" with an attitude. Strike one. I didn't like that response again coming from a server my response would've been absolutely I apologize I didn't think your food would come out so fast or something along those lines. Ok, strike one I'll let it go. A little while down the meal an older \"bougie\" woman was sitting behind us with one of the chefs. Now keep in mind, I'm Pacific Islander and have a sleeve of tattoos, typically I get judged by ones who think they are of a higher class. None the less, I can definitely afford to be eating at this restaurant. Anyway, she sat with the chef and continuously stared at my family and myself and was making comments to the chef and our server. Whatever I also let it go, it was my younger brothers birthday and I wasn't going to let some random woman ruin it. But what upset me was when she muttered something to my server he looked back at her laughed and said \"I would respond but I don't want to offend anyone else in this room.\" Clearly I knew he was talking about my table, because I know he wasn't talking about the 4 elderly people having a quiet dinner in the corner behind us or the two business people eating beside us. I found it to be rude but again said nothing just thought ok strike two. Now what really tipped me over the edge to where I just had to pay out and leave because again I didn't want to ruin my 15 year old brothers birthday; I asked the busser before asking for the check if the restaurant does anything for birthdays. He said they do bring it out but you have to pay for the dessert. I had a cake at home for him so I didn't want to pay for a dessert my brother is a kid and I know kids like to feel special on their birthday that was all. So again coming from someone who works in the industry I thought let me double check with my server because sometimes the bussers don't know. I checked again and advised the server I asked the busser and this is what he told me. The server annoyingly looked at me and said \"yes you have to pay, did you want something\"? I said no it's fine he doesn't need the dessert it was just the matter of if you did do something complimentary it would be a nice touch to the night and make him feel special. My server looked at me and said \"no we don't sooooo the check\"? I said ok yeah sure lets close out. After he brings out the tab before running my card he picks up a dinner candle off another table, puts it in my brothers face and shouted \"we have a birthday\" laughed, picked up the check and proceeded to close us out. Aside from wanting to knock him out at this point because he was clearly mocking me i felt extremely bad for my younger brother who was completely embarrassed. Needless to say he did NOT blow it out. The experience was completely rude and I was completely baffled to have been treated the way our server treated us. The food was great and for four of us to eat was $150. Not bad for a nice restaurant but not cheap for shitty service. I didn't ask for a manager and I was going to write a note to the server explaining how humiliating he made us feel. Instead I left him 20% which now I regret due to him making our time there regrettable, however as I stated before the food was impeccable and speed of service was great so I tipped based on that. However I will not be returning to this establishment due to this server and felt the need to share my experience.",

My only criticism has to do with how our entrees were served.  Each person in our four person group received their meal separately.  Weird. I mean how hard is it to serve four people at the same time.  The food was very good, from pasta, chicken and veal.  The tilapia picatta was not very tasty.  Fresh fish but way too many capers.  The prices were too high, nearly Strip prices.  $45 for a veal chop is overpriced in my opinion.  Our check was $165 for one appetizer, four entrees, 4 beers, and two sodas.  Just too expensive for a restaurant in a strip mall.  For that reason we will likely skip a second visit.",
