The atmosphere is welcoming and cozy.  If you want to indulge after the amazing meal- you must try the cannolis and tiramisu.  If I could give 10 stars I would !!!",

I've been here 3 times and loved everything I've tried: the signature carbonara made in the peccorino cheese wheel, lobster bisque, fresh breadsticks, bruschetta, eggplant Siciliana, and the list goes on. My personal favorite is the chicken piccata.  The service here is extraordinary and Chef Rudy is so passionate about his food and his guests' experience in his restaurant.

While looking at it and not wanting anything on the menu, I was about to walk out.  Then she asked if I wanted the dinner menu....yes!  Got fettuccine with sea scallops and shrimp with sauce.  It was delicious!  I am not a big eater and always have leftovers, which is preferred; however, this was truly a dish for one; I finished it all.  While waiting for my meal, the chef/owner came over and mentioned that I should make a reservation.  I was taken aback since 1) I was seated immediately and 2) only mtyself and 4 other people in the restaurant.  It was obvious they were setting up (& loudly) for a large party.   PRO: excellent food; would have loved a larger portion for $25.00 CON: Was told: \"Next time make a reservation.\"  No bar. Plain ambiance.",

    "text": "We were going out with friends and wanted to try a local restaurant that none of us had been to before. Il Chianti fit the bill. Ambiance: the restaurant is one of several eateries small nondescript strip mall just off the 515 freeway. The restaurant is fairly small and only minimally decorated. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights they have a piano player /singer. When we first got there, the restaurant was pretty packed. The combination of a crowded restaurant with a piano player / singer made it pretty noisy when we first got in. As the night went on the noise level went down and it was actually fairly enjoyable. Service: almost immediately after the hostess seated us, our server, Rose, was at our table to get our drink order. She was also very helpful in making menu choices. She was very friendly and welcoming. I especially like it when the owner or the chef work the room to make sure things are going well. Rudy, the owner and Chef, was in the dining room multiple times during the night talking to the guests and getting feedback. Overall, five star service. Food: photographs of the adobo mushrooms made it appear incredibly appetizing. We ordered them as a share item for the table. It did not disappoint!! An outstanding dish. For a main course I ordered the chicken Angelo. It is a huge portion of food with a couple of pounded chicken breasts, artichoke hearts, other veggies , in a light creamy sauce. Delicious. My wife had the chicken Vesuvio. Also a huge portion and quite delicious. You can bring your own wine for a corkage fee of $20. Value: excellent service, huge portions of very tasty food , an owner / chef who circulates throughout the restaurant during the dinner, live entertainment, all for about $25 a head. Now that's real value in a local restaurant. I will certainly return.",

My mother actually suggested this for my birthday and we both live very close to the restaurant. Both of our meals were great we both had a pasta dish. I ordered the linguine Alla Mediterranea a linguine with shrimp, scallop, asparagus, brown butter sage and white truffle oil. It sounded amazing. When our dinner was brought to us I was so stunned by how beautiful it looked I started pulling clams out of the shells and couldn't wait to taste it. At about the time I got all of the clams out, I realized that I was staring at linguine and clams. The waiter walked up and asked how everything was. I said, \"I bet this is going to be amazing, but it's not what I ordered\". I didn't want to send it back since I had already pulled all of the clams. It was amazing non the less and this experience gives me good reason to go back and try the Mediterranea. There are a ton of awesome looking dishes on the menu. Give this restaurant a shot. You'll love it and you'll go back.  *Update* - I returned last night 8/14/16 and had The Mediterranea. It was great and everything I had hoped for. I also had the Vegetable Egg Rolls. They were very light and tasty. Chef Rudy has this place under control. It was quite busy too so plan your dinner by maybe making a reservation.",

Multiple workers looked at us (including the chef, who was out greeting a table), but no one spoke to us or offered us any assistance. Not even to say \"We'll be right with you!\" To add to that, the restaurant was stiflingly hot, to the point that patrons were fanning themselves with their menus. We also noticed that none of the people seated had food on their tables. We decided to leave. After we walked halfway to our car, a waitress came running out and offered to seat us but we told her it was too late. We went to Ventano, were immediately seated by a very nice hostess, and had great food & wine.",

I had the veal marsala, which, along with the pasta, was fantastic. My husband ordered the rib eye steak & it was huge, tender, simmered in the most delicious sauce, along with a great pasta. We had so much food that we couldn't finish it all, so his well trained staff packed it up for us. Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert, but we enjoyed listening to the guitar player & chatting with Chef Rudy. This place is fast becoming our new regular hangout!",

I just finished my leftovers for lunch and had to sing its praises!! I had the Lynn Pear tortellini with rock shrimp. Fabulous!! Seriously, one of the best Italian dishes I've had in a long time. Homemade tortellini, yum. Slightly sweet kicked with a mild cheese makes for a smooth delicious dish. Shrimp was a nice flavor added and it had yummy cheeses and spinach in a vodka sauce. I highly recommend this dish!",

I was here with a few friends of mine who visited just a few weeks ago, and we all wanted Italian for dinner. It was my first time then, and I truly enjoyed the ambiance, the food, and the price. It was also great to see Chef Rudy entertaining other diners, so we knew we were in the right place and felt like family. This is the most Italian you can go if ever you're in Henderson, to be honest. It's a great place to bring in friends who are visiting the city.",

    "text": "Each plate costs about $22, which isn't terrible considering the location and other mid-scale chain Italian restaurant prices. The problem I have is that both plates my wife and I ordered were served to us on dirty dishes.  This also isn't a deal breaker most of the time if the wait staff handles it correctly. Unfortunately in my case when I pointed out the dirty dishes to our waitress she immediately gave an excuse about how the cheese that gets put on the dishes burns to a crisp when under the Salamander heating table they use. This was a problem as she didn't even look at our plates before giving the excuse- which implies either they've had complaints like this before and have chosen not to do anything about it, or more importantly, she didn't even care to examine in case it was something other than cheese (which it definitely was in both our cases-- mine was a caked on sauce with flakes in it, my wives looked to be dried Fettuccine sauce). Not the type to be argumentative, I simply asked for the bill. The waitress then gave me the bill and a speech about how she told her chef to be more careful in the future. Much to our surprise the chef then came around the corner and asked us if we had tried the Limoncello and asked if we enjoyed our meal-- which wouldn't have been the case had he been informed we didn't eat it because of the dirty plates as we had -just- been told he was informed of. The restaurant was not busy. There is no excuse. Further complaints: the shrimp used in one of our dishes was clearly store bought frozen shrimp. The ambient music was from Pandora- which wouldn't be noticeable if the commercial free pandora was being paid for instead of advertised in between every third song. Finally, as it was apparent we weren't going to eat the food provided and were not satisfied with the excuse of cheese being melted into our plates (which even if it legitimately was -which it wasn't-, maybe take a second to wipe the 22 dollar plate off before serving it) we were given a 10 percent discount on the plates. These should have been comped. I will never return.",

For example lamb chops with dates and they were actually terrific. Chicken piccata, chicken franchese, Chicken Parmesan they have everything you can think of. Chef Rudy very nice comes out and is very appreciative of the business. Not like some of these restaurant owners that act like you owe them to come to their restaurant. He is very grateful and his food and staff show it. I actually recommend this restaurant and will be returning many many times.",

The restaurant is easy to access, located in a parking lot with plenty of parking. The dining area is clean and has a nice ambiance.   The menu has a wide variety of options with different protein dishes, pastas, salads, and risottos. On my first visit I had the Chicken Vesuvio which I enjoyed. There was a nice portion of chicken and pasta. The sauce and toppings were good too. My husband had Veal Parmesan and thought it was good. For dessert we shared the Lemoncello Gelato that chef recommended. I thought it was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again.   On second visit I had the Seafood Pan Roast which had a variety of seafood in a pink sauce with asparagus risotto. I didn't love this dish. The pink sauce was tasty, but I didn't think the sauce paired well with the salmon. The risotto was well prepared, but not very flavorful. My husband's Gnocchi Con Vodka was very good and well prepared.   The best part of this restaurant is Chef Rudy. I love that he comes out to the dining room and talks to all of his guests. It's great to see someone so passionate about their business and that seems to genuinely enjoy interacting with their customers.",

It's a small restaurant and when I went last Saturday they had live music for dinner that really set the tone. The small restaurant also provides a very community feel to it. People interact with one another, it's lively and friendly.  Service was great. Our waiter was great and gave us some great info regarding the specials and dishes. I'm 20 so I can't drink, I asked if they had anything like a Shirley temple, which they didn't, but what he basically recommended was a virgin sangria and it was great. I loved it. Basically it was sprite with sangria mix and fresh fruits.   My parents ordered sangrias as well (1 red and 1 white) that were apparently very good as well.  For appetizers, we tried both the calamari and the adobo mushrooms. Mushrooms were amazing, the sauce was amazing and had some dates in it that gave it a little sweetness. Calamari was good too, but the mushrooms were undoubtedly my favorite between the two.   For dinner, my mom and I split the special: prime rib with green beans and scalloped potatoes for 36$. They split it for us in the back and it was so much food. They brought the plate and my mom thought that's how it normally came until they put down my plate. It was really yummy, prime rib was tender and cooked well, greenbeans had lots of garlic.  My dad ordered the adobo nation which was super yummy as well with lots of chicken and porkbelly and my little sister had the fettuccini alfredo and a bowl of clam chowder.  Chef Rudy also came by to talk to us, which was so nice. Apparently they do cheese wheel pasta on Wednesdays and Thursdays which I have to try sometime. Being from the Philippines, he and my parents were talking about where they're from and the influence in his food.  Also, definitely get the dessert. We had the limoncello (lemon gelato on a fried wonton) and the lava cake. Both were amazing, the lava cake was the best I've ever had, rich and creamy. The limoncello was refreshing and just perfect.  We'll definitely be back!  PS: the bread is amazing too, kinda reminded me of pan de sal.",

And the Cheese Bowl that finishes off the pasta is just incredible and my little grandbaby gets to be Chef. Portions are very substantial and there is a great ambiance. We've been back four times and this has become our favorite place. Ask for Rose as your server. She is just so attentive and fun. Chef Rudy is so personable and makes you feel right at home.",

    "text": "First impressions are key when it comes to any business, especially when you get a personal invitation from the Chef of an Italian restaurant.  Most times it starts with an introduction, in promoting it's a face, or in marketing it may be and ad with photos.  At Il Chianti it was a succession of all; and a very well made first impression plus inspirations.  Chef Rudy's invitation arrived three weeks prior to our visit.  In the days leading to our first dining experience here, a good friend had been raving about dishes and desserts.  Finally a plan to dine here was put forth.  We met Chef Rudy.  Dang whatta guy!  He's so personable, made us crack up, sat at our table and chatted up.  Diners were coming and going and you can just see with the interpersonal engagements that he's an appreciated human being.  Really awesome to meet you Chef!  Thank you for having us and for your crave-a-licious food!  Gratitude as well to our servers and introducing MacMurray Ranch Pinot.  Dinnertime meet up was 7pm on a perfect autumn evening, where the view from outside seating is the after sunset glow blanketing the horizon, and the city lights are awake.  Such a sight!  The location is perfect.  Add to that some red wine and antipasti, you're on a roll to a well spent evening.  Beef Carpaccio with burruta cheese...first timer.  How interesting is the way the meat covers the plate like one sheet, then peels off like soft butter.  I like this appetizer, together with the garlic bread sticks served with infused olive oil.  Great for sharing!  Dinner plates: Chef Rudy's Adobo Nation, Lynn Pear & Cheese Tortellini, and Risotto con Funghi.  Heavy? Yes.  But delicious?  Ultimate YES!  We believe it cuz we've tasted it... the unique fusion and pairing, with flavor knock outs!  It's different and savor worthy.    I had the Lynn Pear & Cheese Tortellini in tomato vodka sauce.  This dish with all the playful flavors woohooo went surprisingly well together.  I ordered it for the pears, cuz it's not a usual pasta dish I'd point out.  Actually it's not a dish I've seen anywhere else at all.  I got more than just a curious satisfaction.  Tastes really delicious!  If you order this, try to consume it while it's still hot.  Of course having a conversation with laughs and sentimentality during dinnertime may cause difficulty to keep food hot while conversing.  Desserts: creme brulee, tiramisu, limoncello ice cream.  They're all to cry over for more.  But I beg you please DO NOT MISS OUT on the limoncello ice cream.  Perhaps you've never been here before and you're so undecided with all the wonderful menu choices.  Let me help you... Start out with the limoncello ice cream.  Sure why not?!  I'm all for dessert first!  May you dream of the limoncello ice cream... Hear it beckon you...  Chef, twas an honor!  You're an inspiration, a good influence, a supporter, a positive presence in the community.  Thanks so much for the tip on cooking classes, Cooking With Papa.  Sounds like a fun idea for a birthday gig!  We shall see ya' again especially for the... c'mon everyone LIMONCELLO ICE CREAM!!!  Good job high ten high ten :D",

First the bread (we learned in Italy, years ago, it's a good indicator of whether an Italian restaurant is going to be good) was good - nice and hot. I was a little disappointed in the olive oil with which it was served - not very flavorful.   For an appetizer we ordered the grilled marinated baby lamb chops with mint served with figs & a wasabi sauce. They were recommended by the chef/owner as he came by to welcome us to his restaurant. They were amazing!  Main courses: I ordered the Lynn Pear & Cheese which was pear-stuffed cheese tortellini with Rock Shrimp, spinach, mozzarella baked in a tomato vodka sauce. The sauce was just a touch salty, but otherwise very good. Dish was a good balance between the savory and sweet.  My husband ordered the veal scaloppine and loved it - said the veal was delicious, pasta was al dente and sauce was very good.  No room for dessert, even though they all looked yummy.",

I love the intimate atmosphere, from the white tablecloths and dim lighting to the live soft guitar/piano music.  Everytime I've come, Chef Rudy has come out to personally greet us.  I appreciate that nice personal touch.  Today, the service was slower than usual but it was understandable as it was a full house! This is a definite hidden gem in Henderson that I highly recommend.",

    "text": "This is a small Italian restaurant that opened this past May.  Chef Rudy previously served as executive chef at the long standing Ventano's.  Warm garlic rolls were served which were largely ignored.  We decided to share the chef's eponymous salad, but what arrived at our table 20 minutes after ordering was the frisee classica (frisee, cherry tomatoes, caramelized walnuts and apple wood bacon dressing) which was light and delicious. The restaurant was busy for a Tuesday evening and Rudy had only a sous chef in the kitchen so it was a full 45 minutes after ordering that we received our entrees.  I hitched my wagon, or at least my waistline, once again to the chef by ordering Chef Rudy's Adobo Nation (chicken Adobo, pork tenderloin, soy, red wine vinegar) that was served with a side of creamy asperagus (sic) risoto (sic). This dish was very good with kudos extended to the the excellent  risotto.  My wife was not as fortunate with her chicken Marsala entree that came with pasta awash in Marsala sauce.  Near the end of the meal I caught our server and requested a glass of water.  Either he did not understand or simply ignored my request in order to bus 2 empty tables. In my opinion, Chef Rudy needs to spend more time tending to details in the kitchen than spending time  schmoozing with his customers.",

We LOVE Papa Rudy's interpretation of classic Italian dishes. Its so good you want to lick the plate! One of the best things about living and/or visiting fabulous Las Vegas is the myriad of dining choices. If you leave Las Vegas hungry, it's your own fault! I would highly recommend Il Chianti as one of those choices.",

From my experience it seems that the locals love this place because our server seemed to know everyone by name.  My girlfriend and I shared the caprese salad which was fantastic, I had veal piccata and she ate the cioppino, also very delicious.  She doesn't drink so I had a glass of the house Chianti (\"when in Rome\") that is also sold by the bottle.  The food selection is terrific for a small, hole in the wall type restaurant.  The service was very friendly and personal, and there was live music from a talented guitarist that made for a nice relaxing environment.  I wouldn't put this place on any favorite list but I would go back if she wanted to.",

Our server was amazing, he was helpful in navigating the menu and made great recommendations. One of the best experiences I've ever had service wise, and the live music was icing on the cake.   The fettuccine alfredo was incredible and the bread is insanely good. I have no doubt the rest of the menu is just as good if not even better. If you're in the Las Vegas area this is the best place to eat by far.   Great atmosphere, service, and a world class chef. Will definitely eat here whenever I'm in Vegas again",

A very small place with a very old fashioned Italian family like feel. However much to our surprise this very special Chef is from the Philippines and classically trained as an Italian chef. We were drawn to the appetizer of 4 lamb ribs broiled to perfection and served with spices dates. The Caesar salad was fresh and ample. Pasta with scallops, shrimp ,mushrooms in a vodka red sauce. The recommended Chianti was perfect. The staff was very attentive and family like. The chef himself visited tables several times during our visit. Good for families as well as dates. Several nights a week there is very nice live dinner music provided by local guitarist and singer. Very enjoyable Dinner our last night in Vegas",

Very authentic, tastes fresh, not overly salty like you would experience in other places. I would highly suggest the lamb chops for the appetizer. The live music was perfect. Not too loud, still able to hold a conversation with the people at my table. The prices were great for the quantity and quality. A tad more than you would pay at a chain restaurant but so worth the extra cost because the quality is worth it. Great place for casual dinner with friends or a nice date.",

When we sat down the head chef came over to our table to greet us and shared some of his favorite dishes. It was a nice personal touch! He also came back after our meal to ask us how it was. The waiter was very friendly too. They had live music in the front corner of the restaurant. It was fun to sing along while we waited for our food. And the food was fantastic! The pasta and seafood tasted fresh. The food and wine was a little pricey, but they gave us nice sized portions. We had enough to take home and eat for lunch the next day. The wine selection was great too! Will be back soon, it's a nice place to take friends and family when they come to visit!",

However when we arrived at 8pm, which was our appointed time, we did not get to sit till more than a hour later.  To make customers wait that long is unforgivable.  I know they accepted one too many reservations to cash in.   But that make their service to the pits.  You do not make people wait that long.  By the way, we ate there on Christmas eve",

My five year old couldn't eat the meatballs fast enough, and after stealing a bite from her I could see why.  The food is only part of the story. Chef Rudy interacted with every customer, making us feel like family.  It wasn't a forced interaction, but a genuine heart felt greeting and welcoming into what after a few minutes felt like his home and not his business. He couldn't have been more sincere.  We will most certainly be back to enjoy Chef Rudy's food, hospitality, and company.",

Homemade pasta was delicious and the dishes were so good. Only downside is that my sauce broke while I was eating so by the time I finished my meal the pasta was sitting in a bowl of melted butter. Now I a awesome at repressing my knowledge of butter and cream levels in a cream sauce (yay for subconscious rationalization) but that was too much to be appealing for me. Overall we'll definitely come back and give it another try. I love to see and support a local chef in a setting like this.",

The Filipino fusion dish was unlike any dish I've ever had at an Italian place, and it was fantastic. I can get lasagna anywhere, and this dish really show cased the chef's background and his Italian focus. Don't be afraid to try something new.

Of course I knew of his work and reputation as an outstanding chef prior to seeing his restaurant when he was a chef at other places I've seen his creativity and his passion for many years.  My wife and I were very happy to see that he now has his own place of business. He is old school cook that puts love into everything he prepares like myself. You can't fake that you either love what you do or you don't the food on the plate is a direct reflection of whats in your heart and Chef Rudy is a super nice guy with a big heart and an amazing talent for cooking.",

He comes out from the kitchen and greets his guests throughout the evening, asking with genuine care how you like your dish. Everything we've had has been simply divine so our answer is always \"DELICIOUS\"! I am certain though that if something weren't to our satisfaction or liking her would personally see to it that we had something more suited to our tastes without hesitation.  The ambiance is also lovely. The restaurant is small and quaint, and feels so warm and welcoming. Some nights there is even live music (piano and/or acoustic guitar). We love Il Chianti and will continue to frequent and support our local business owner. If you haven't yet tried this place do your taste buds a favor and go! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Last month my business trip took me back to Las Vegas. I drove to Henderson where I normally stay, and stopped to grab a small bite. I usually take back routes because I enjoy the scenery. Driving on West Horizon Ridge Parkway, this illuminated new sign, caught my attention. The sign read, \"Il Chianti Italian Restaurant\" (pronounced \"Kee Auntie\"). I decided to check it out although dressed in sweats. Once inside I thought to myself, \"oh no, this is a white table cloth place and I'm in sweats.\" I felt out of place; but not for long since the hostess immediately made me feel at ease.   While looking over the menu, I could smell the aroma. I observed my surroundings and saw so many happy expressions, and delighted faces. A few minutes went by, and was shocked when the Owner/Chef Rudy, came over and introduced himself. This friendly gentleman welcome me with a great smile. To me, that told me, he was very involved in his restaurant, and noticed new patrons.   Ultimately, I decided on the Insalata Classica and Lobster Bisque. I wasn't too hungry to begin with, but the aroma lured me in. When I took several mouthfuls of the salad, I was blown away with the variety of different flavors and spices. The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Those caramelized walnuts were mouthwatering. What really blew me away was the Italian Garlic Salad Dressing. This sent me to Heaven and back. \"Wow\"!! No words to explain.   Several minutes later, the Lobster Bisque arrived. I began the journey of consumption of \"MY\" Lobster Bisque. That first spoon \"sent me into orbit\"!! I honestly was taken to another planet, passed Pluto, than landed in Tuscany as my final destination. Cannot say enough of how delicious it was. Finally, stuffed and content, I motioned for the waiter to call the chef again so I can give him my compliments and kiss the ground he walked on. The waiter smiled and laughed. Unfortunately, I was too full to eat the rest of my amazing salad, \"I so loved.\" I took it to go and promised to return on Monday. The chef informed me that Monday was the only day they were closed. I plan on going back solely for the eating experience, on an empty stomach and to enjoy the rest of that phenomenal menu. A very happy customer, Yasmin Steinke",

For appetizers we had pork belly on sliced bread.  The pork belly was covered with teriyaki sauce and the bread was covered with garlic butter. The calamari appetizer was very chewy and very messy to eat. As a main dish I had Adobe Chicken with Pork Belly and the sauce tasted just like my appetizer. The meal for two people for 100.00 was not worth it. Olive Garden would have tasted better and way cheaper.  However, I did like the service of the staff and we thought it was awesome that the Chef came out and greeted the customers",

We 1st had some very good bread that we nearly filled up on because it was that good. I was served the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had in my life. My daughter is a tiny little thing that never finishes anything, let's just say she didn't need a to go box for her Chicken Parm dish. My pasta finished off in a cheese wheel (that was so yummy). The Tiramisu was on point and they had Spumoni ice cream that my daughter loves. Overall we had great food, great service, and a fabulous Chef.",

We've been enjoying Il Chianti for two months now, 7 visits in all, and every time the food, service and ambiance have been nothing short of impeccable.   We met warm-hearted Chef Rudy Janeo on our first visit, he greeted us enthusiastically at the door, and checked in on us several times throughout our meal. This is one highly experienced top-notch Chef who is extremely passionate about his food and his guests, who truly desires to bring you the very best dining and entertainment experience. And it shows. Truly a one-of-a-kind extraordinary chef who serves each meal with kindness, laughter and genuine feeling, makes you feel a part of his family from the start.   On our most recent visit two nights ago, live soft jazz was playing which set such a beautiful mood throughout our entire meal. Thank you Chef Rudy, we loved it!!  We were greeted and seated immediately, and within two minutes had some of Chef's famous pillowy bread loaves with a balsamic and olive oil dipping sauce. These rolls are fresh, warm, flavorful and addictive, and are generously served throughout your meal.   Now that we've had a chance to meander our way through the beautiful and lengthy menu, here are some of our repeat favorites:  *Apps* Involtini di Michelle -- An extraordinary crispy-light lumpia, filled with fresh-crisp hot veggies and wrapped in butter lettuce with thai basil and an amazing sauce drizzle. Plus sweet chili and wasabi aioli for dipping. So delicious, we order this every single time, you should, too!  Calamari & Onion Ring Fritti -- Fresh and light calamari and onion rings combined with a spicy marinara and just the right kick of jalapeno cream. Never greasy or heavy, just perfect!  Burrata Caprese Salad -- New to the menu and therefore by request only, but if you love burrata (fresh mozzarella filled with fresh cream, gently aged to perfection), it's a definite must-order, with thick-sliced real tomatoes, red onion, capers and eggplant.   *Mains* Linguine Fra Diavolo -- Succulent jumbo shrimp and basil leaves in a bold marinara sauce over fresh linguine pasta...I like to add a bit of fresh spinach and I could eat this every day all day long, it is that good!  Lobster Ravioli with Blackened Shrimp -- OMG need i say more, this is an incredible dish full of love and character, beautifully prepared with asparagus and an amazing vodka tomato sauce finish  Lynn Pear & Cheese -- Most recently tried this popular specialty combining rock shrimp with homemade cheese and pear tortellini, the to-die-for vodka tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese baked atop. You can't go wrong with this one, it's compelling and creative and oh so delicious.   Cioppino Alla Livornese -- Outstanding flavorful broth with abundant lobster, shrimp, scallops plus clams, mussels, salmon and more. Trust me, you're going to want extra bread to soak up all the delicious flavors!  Hubby swears by the Chicken Scallopini, Veal Piccata, and Spaghetti Bolognese...best he's had, bar none. The Italian Sausage is large and in charge, two fat juicy links of wholesome Italian goodness.   You really must save room for one or three of Chef Rudy's outstanding desserts, all lovingly prepared in-house. Lemoncello Gelato, Tiramisu and Creme Brulee are must-have favorites, and new surprises are appearing all the time. Honestly, we've never had a better or more beautifully flavored Tiramisu, ever!  Il Chianti is a small drive for us from Boulder City, but we would gladly drive twice as far to experience truly extraordinary Italian cuisine at its freshest and finest. Say hello to Chef Rudy whenever you visit, he'll be delighted to meet you!!",

I've probably driven by this place a hundred times before that and I hate that I didn't give this a try sooner.   Chef Rudy is an amazing chef and has loads of respect for his customers. I was absolutely amazed at the level of service he alone gives.   The food is amazing as well. All of it is completely made from scratch and Chef Rudy will even add things if you request it. I love spicy food and he can accommodate that on almost any dish. The bread they give you is amazing as well. Easily the greatest bread I have ever tasted. It is of course hand made and baked in the kitchen. The house made marinara is amazing. My description doesn't do it justice.  I almost forgot, they also have some live music on Fridays and Saturdays. Also a great experience while you are enjoying a meal. They played live jazz when I came in on the weekend. It was great!  If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and give this place a chance. You won't regret it.",

So much so in fact I have dined solo multiple times. It is a small family owned and operated restaurant. The chef Rudy is personality and flavor, he is charismatic and welcoming and he visits every table to ensure you are having the best experience. I can not say enough good things about this place. There is live music on the weekends by Calvin and he is great, if there are children dining he will include them by playing songs such as the Wheels on the bus. We ate here for Thanksgiving, (they had a special menu) and had a wonderful time. I absolutely love the food, from the appetizers to dessert. There is a great wine selection as well. Thank you Chef Rudy for my favorite restaurant in town!",

Found this place on Yelp and I was sold when I read Weds nights were cheese wheel nights. So my husband and I came here and ordered the Vegetable Lumpia as an appetizer and Lobster Ravioli and Chicken Marsala with the cabornara? Pasta from the cheese wheel as a side. We were in Italian food heaven. And the place is so intimate. Don't let the shopping  mall fool you this is the place for family dining. My suggestion is everyone order something and just share it all. I loved that the chef came out to talk with us as well. I'm very excited to look into his cooking club that meets twice a month. Definately a diamond in the rough here in the Las Vegas desert.   UPDATE!!  May 26th, 2018... ordered their special.. Filet Mignon with shrimp, mushroom risotto and asparagus... OMG sooo mouthwatering!! Seriously.. EAT HERE!",

First thing I noticed was the ambiance. Dimmed lighting with Sinatra music playing in the background.....gives me that whole Chicago/New York vibe. We told our waiter this was our first time here and he gave us a quick run of the menu, specials of the day and some of their popular items.   I ordered the beef and cheese tortellini and my boyfriend got the veal vesuvio. We both were highly pleased with our entrees. Food came out pippin hot and portions were plentiful. Enough for leftovers too. We will definitely be returning...there were other entrees I wanted to try...like the Chicken Parm or the Carbonara Della Nonna.  FYI, restaurant is closed Mondays so plan accordingly. Smaller sized restaurant so you may have to make a reservation if you're planning to come with a big party.",

Had the pasta with garlic cream sauce with prosciutto which was too salty for me. My friend has the veal which she enjoyed. Would go back and get 2 of the lamb appetizer as a meal! Don't have any pics as I was too hungry and forgot. Service was also great, Carlo was nice.",

Food is Italian done well and right. Delicious. Ambience is intimate or community with your choice of white linen tables inside/outside or a big community table on patio with twinkle lights. Choose your own adventure. I've had the eggplant parm, Caesar salad, meatballs and canolli there. All super yummy. What can I say. I am a fan of il Chianti.",

My husband had Mediterranean pasta, again cooked to perfection with each different seafood cooked exactly the way it should be!  The sauce should be bottled and sold delish!!!!  Oh yeah and the complimentary/warm garlic bread simply delicious.  The service was A+! We stayed after dinner just to listen to the live singer.  Can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "Well...after my expensive disappointment a few weeks ago at Giada, this was a nice hidden Italian gem only minutes from my home. It is nestled in a strip shopping center on Horizon right off the 95 heading to the Hoover Dam. It is a very quaint restaurant that probably has about 16-20 tables, the decor is very tasteful and well done....but the food is truly the highlight of this place.   So we were sat down and they took our drink orders and then our waitress Rosa came by and ask is if we were doing appetizers. We requested the calamari and an onion soup (yes I know it was 116 degrees outside, but I really wanted one). Then the owner, Chef Rudy, came by and he could tell it was our first time here so he brought a little something extra as an appetizer. So first came out the fresh bake bread with your traditional olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was very good, but it also came out with a chunky tomato sauce that was also very creamy at the same time and had really an exceptional taste. Then, came the calamari and the French onion soup the calamari had two sauces and one of them was sweet and tangy. The French onion soup was thick and not too salty and the guyere cheese was melted perfectly. Then, Chef Rudy came by and brought us two slabs of pork belly in adobo!!!! You need to ask for this when you come it, it was amazing and full of flavor. I just wanted to lick the plate. Then, for our main entrees we ordered the risotto pescatore and the Lynn Pear and cheese. I had the risotto, but I am so anal about having shells on my plate that I asked Rosa if she could shuck the mussels for me and she did. My plate was huge two to three people could have eaten from it. I brought enough for lunch tomorrow. There were scallops, shrimps, mussels and clams and the Risotto was cooked perfectly.   Now my husband had the Lynn Pear and Cheese and oh my god, it was one of the best Italian dishes I had in a long time. I would say that is their staple dish based on a lot of the reviews a must have if it is your first time there. The Pear is not overpowering but it gives the plate some interesting flavors for your palate. Chef Rudy came by again and he was making rounds to all the tables being very attentive and telling us about brunch and special events there and we will definitely come back.   For dessert, have the Lemoncello Gelato it's not to overly sweet or bitter from the lemon but the sauce that goes over the gelato just tastes so good. This place is also very economical and the plates range from 18-25 dollars for an upscale restaurant with the majority of the ingredients made in house. Chef Rudy mentioned to us, if you don't love to cook and have the passion the food is just not going to come out right, the food was amazing so  I take it he is very passionate about his food. Everything was fresh and made to order.   So, if you are looking a for a new restaurant and venture out this is the place for you. Yes, it maybe 15-20 min from the strip in the eastern part of Henderson off of Horizon and the 95, but trust me, you will not be disappointed. Rosa, thank you for the amazing service too you rocked and we will be back very soon to try your brunch.",

I prefer when salads are served on chilled plates though. My chicken francese was very tasty & my husband LOVED his lamb chops. The chef visted our table & made food suggestions, which was a very nice personal touch. The embionce was very lovely, with music in the background. It seemed ro be playing from a radio station however, so there were a few commercials. Maybe a CD or mp3 player would be a better choice. I will definitely go back here without a doubt. The prices were decent as well. We skipped dessert because we were too full!",

We also ordered bruschetta, a kids entree, tiramisu and cannoli. Total bill was $90, a bit more than I expected given Yelp listed it as $$. I think $$$ would be more accurate. But the food was amazing and definitely worth the price.  This was our first visit, which we took as a carry out order after a hard weekend of housework.

Such a great guy Rose, our server was so very polite & attentive to every need! She gave us wine recommendations & explained each dish & I absolutely love the fact that she came to our table to let us decide when the entree should start cooking, we were not in a hurry & we wanted to enjoy our appetizers & take our time! What amazing attention to detail!  The appetizers ( bruschetta) were perfectly done, &  had just a hint of spice which made it over the top perfect! The fresh bread & balsamic vinegar dipping oils were the best we ever tasted. That balsamic must of been aged 100 years, so smooth! The main course had such fresh explosions of flavor. I had the eggplant siciliano & it was nice & hot & cooked to perfection with just enough cheese & sauce...we are looking forward to going back again & again!",

But this is among the few that have food, a more-than-average wine list, and that blessedly quiet atmosphere that soothes (and yes, sometimes live entertainment! ), for a couples dinner or a peaceful dinner for any number to enjoy.   Chef Rudy is personable and the staff is quietly attentive.  I would compare this experience to Sonoma Cellar or Fuego, without the parking a mile away or the noisy casino to trek through.   And no waiting.     Definitely worth a first visit.  Chef Rudy remembers you when you become a regular.  Trust me, you will.",

The bread basket was so good!  The balsamic vinegar with the oil was delicious!  It was an aged balsamic that was sweet but savory.  We opted for the chef's special and it did not disappoint.  $35 for salad, pasta and filet mignon.  It was a dressed Caesar, which was delicious.  The pasta was bucatini, which was cooked in a Parmigiano Reggiano cheese barrel!  Soooo good!  The filet was small, but just the right size to accompany the decadent pasta.  It was atop a marinara sauce, and accompanied by crisp prosciutto.  The fresh pasta was simply amazing.  The chef came to our table twice and we enjoyed chatting with Chef Rudy.  We assured him we will be back.  The waitress told us about the special Valentine's Day prix fix menu and we were intrigued.  This is a neighborhood gem in Henderson.  Small, quaint, and delicious food!",

    "text": "This place is, and forever will be, Rudy's Place!  My folks had been here once before and took me, themselves having been invited by friends who are regulars here. Their rave reviews were well-warranted.  Chef Rudy is clearly classically trained, and his menu shows it, with favorites such as over a dozen pasta dishes, salads, and an abundance of chicken and veal entrees. However, I believe that Rudy's Filipino heritage still shines True with a healthy attention to southern Italian seafood with coastal greats like cioppino, and a whole section dedicated to risotto -- and if that wasn't enough he features his own spin of chicken adobo and lumpia!  While located in a shopping mall the locale of quiet Henderson, NV keeps it away from the chaotic hustle and bustle of Las Vegas proper, but still within sight of the Strip. In fact it even overlooks it, making it a great spot come July 4th or New Years when the fireworks start to fly! The interior is decorated smartly, with a corner bristling with wines, a large open window to the kitchen in the back, and a live guitarist/keyboardist near the front.  We were immediately greeted by smiling servers who took us to our seats. The other patrons were attired in a mix of smart casual, sportcoats, dresses, jeans, families, and young couples clearly out on a date. In short, no one felt out of place.  While initially my thought was to try Chef Rudy's chicken parmigana, which is how I gauge all my Italian restaurants, my eyes were immediately drawn to his chicken adobo and its description. Chicken filets paired with risotto, with asparagus and pork belly, there was nothing in that sentence I didn't like.  For an appetizer we tried the shrimp bruschetta. The shrimp had delightful heat, the bread crusty but soaked through the center with the sauce and oil giving each bite an almost juicy feel. Paired with the bruschetta slices was a salad with a smoky vinaigrette, smoky due to the bacon bits that gave the greens a nice crunch.  The table bread was fresh out of the oven, soft on the inside, delicately topped with toasted cheese, and absolutely amazing. The only reason we didn't order triple refills was to save room for the main course. And I'm glad we did.  My adobo was scrumptious, Chef Rudy's adding a bit more sweetness and tang to his adobo sauce to complement the risotto and asparagus. The chicken was incredibly tender and aromatic, and the risotto itself perfectly al dente.  The other entrees we selected were the cioppino - which was overflowing with clams, mussels, squid, salmon chunks, and shrimp in an aromatic broth with just enough of a zesty kick; and the veal parmigana which was melt-in-your-mouth with al dente pasta.  All throughout the staff were incredibly friendly, always refilling our beverages and checking in on us. Chef Rudy himself was personally checking at each table, greeting and making small talk with each of his patrons. With his regulars, of which there were many, he would stay and chat even longer, even pulling up a chair and conversing with them at length before returning to his kitchen.  He even recognized my folks from their last visit, even getting my mother an extra side of pasta for her cioppino without blinking. In talking with him, he is a man very clearly proud of his food and his craft, expressing that he was more interesting in delivering quality food and experience rather than opening countless locations. He loves giving back to his community and to his homeland.  Apparently on Tuesdays and Wednesdays he hosts a special dining event where pasta dishes are served in cheese wheels. If that was not reason enough to go out and try Rudy's Place, then clearly you just don't love good Italian food!",

She said yes call me Friday before you come in for your 7:30  reservation. I called Friday at 5 o'clock to remind her she said yes will make up a dessert plate with candles and etc. We get to the restaurant we order wine, the red wine comes out hot. We ordered our food the steak wasn't so good, the sauce on the steak was not good at all. So the waiter came over and asked if we wanted dessert, I looked at him like  really we've already planned this. Needless to say the table next to us got a birthday dessert and they were singing happy birthday to her, but they totally forgot that I had set this  up 2 hours prior, and had talked on the phone .  Very disappointed in our whole experience there...",

I was looking at the menu and there were so many items that caught my eye, but I was trying to follow a certain diet. Then chef Rudy came by the table and introduce himself, I told him about my diet restrictions and he said I'll make something for you! My friend ordered the salmon with a salad and I ended up getting Chilean sea bass with grilled romaine Caesar salad style.  AMAZING!!!  The sangria is very delicious too.  Ever since I have been back several times for lunch and dinner. Dinner is nice because they have life entertainment Thursday - Sunday!  If you haven't been to il Chianti yet, you should definitely go. If you have you already know how good it is!",

    "text": "I am so sad to be writing this review as the main course was actually pretty good. I left and my first comment was how perfect the pasta was. My husband took me here on a date last night. First issue, the music was so loud for the small restaurant. I could hear the music from outside in the parking lot. It was difficult to talk to my husband over what was supposed to be a romantic dinner. Second issue was the rude service.The first service issue was that he was trying to push alcohol on me. I informed him I was pregnant and not interested. Despite me telling him no he considered the alcohol conversation telling me how I probably really wanted some wine. I awkwardly laughed and politely requested water for the second time. Then, my husband and I ordered. I ordered the Gnocchi Con Vodka (no meat) I don't eat meat. The server suggested I add a protein which I told him no thank you. He then continued to try to push a protein on me saying I just had to have sausage on my plate it wouldn't be as good without it. I had to tell him no FOUR times before my husband stepped in and said she said \"no thank you\". It is pretty disgusting that a male server not respect a female patrons first FOUR denials. It is misogynistic and degrading personally that I had to have my husband tell this guy \"No\" for him to listen. Third, the service was slow and our waters were empty over 1/2 our meal. Fourth, the dessert we ordered was terrible and not worth the money. I ordered the molten lava cake which says it should be served with raspberry ice cream. The cake came out and it was completely over cooked and had coffee ice cream (I prefer not to consume coffee since I am pregnant and it isn't great for the baby). If you've ever had a molten lava cake you know the inside should be runny (hence the name lava cake) to my disappointment the cake was solid and dry. I normally finish my desert this is one of the only times I didn't even eat half of it. We waited another 20 minutes or so to notify our server we were ready for our check. I let him know how disappointing the desert was. I told him it was served with the wrong ice cream (which I couldn't notify him of because he was absent for most of our meal) he had a snarky remark about how he had no idea what the menu said or what kind of ice cream the dish should be served with. I was extremely upset with the less than respectful service. I wouldn't go back even if though the main course was pretty good. I don't support establishments where I am not respected.  Update: I have heard back from the Chef. He was extremely kind and apologetic for this visit. I appreciate that greatly!",

    "text": "Saturday March 29th we decided to use a gift certificate we received . We didn't make reservations, thinking if we arrived at 5:30 it would not be busy . Much to our dismay we were informed by the Ethiopian hostess that Saturday is their busy night because they have a band and people come to listen and enjoy . At 5:30 there were probably 4 tables occupied, and the others were plated \" reserved \" .  She sat us near the first table by the exit of the kitchen and that's fine since we didn't make a reservation.  We weren't expecting the best table in the house .  But what she said next was out of line and rude for working as a hostess in a restaurant.  She said \" you need to make reservations next time and the next table here reserved is for 7:30 .  Talk about feeling like we are are on a timeline. Now for the food .. l ordered a cup of the lobster bisque. It was ok . Texas de Brazil is much better . My wife ordered the pan roast . We thought it was good . She didn't like the sausage , but l did . I ordered the veal piccata which was a huge disappointment. It was drowning in butter and cream . . It really took away from the veal . . The pasta served as a side was good ..cooked perfectly ,  l think it shared the same sauce as the veal piccata ???  We had bottled water and a William Hill Chardonnay to wash it all down . Our server and his trainee did a fine job , no complaints.  We didn't see Chef Rudy touching tables and that's fine .. I'm sure he was very busy ..the garlic bread.. it was very good .. Will we go back ? ... yes .. l want to try more items including how the Ceaser salad is . ..we will make reservations next time so we are not scolded at the door by the hostess.",

The Chef came out and greeted every table (so awesome), and there was an awesome guitarist playing music to tracks softly in the background.  Screw going to the strip for fine dining.  This is a hidden gem.   Advice.... Make a Reservation!!! This place packs out quick for dinner!!!  Will be back here many more times to hopefully try all their dishes.",

He also does very unique things with the food he learned in Italy through the years. What else could you really ask for in a restaurant?  Definite \"locals\" feel. This is a place for a foodie.",

    "text": "My wife goes to the gym next door and came home having seen the menu proclaiming we needed to try Il Chianti.  I immediately went on Yelp and checked out the menu and became excited after reading the reviews.  First off, my wife and I are about 30, and have three kids, so it's very hard to find a night where we can go out and enjoy a dinner alone without the whole fam.  Tonight, however, we had a babysitter and an early movie - so we decided to drop in at 4:30, old folks style.    We walked in, only one other couple was seated and eating, so we decided to eat outside in the gorgeous weather.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, we had about three others come out during the course of our meal and fill water, clean plates, etc.  All of the wait staff were friendly, chatty, and professional.  Rudy, the chef, wandered out after we received our calamari and chatted for a while, asking about us and talking about kids, life, etc.  He was incredibly charming, very polite and I have to say he has it figured out, from other reviews I can tell this is something he does regularly and it is a fantastic touch and you can tell it is not forced.  On to the food.  We received two warm, oversized breadsticks that were soft and buttery, with a fantastic sweet balsamic with olive oil.  The calamari app was lightly breaded and the cuts were very tender, served with a marinara with sprinkled red pepper and another pinkish, house-made sauce that I believe the waitress said was a jalapeno/cream sauce.  Both were fantastic.    To the meal; my wife ordered Lynn Pear Tortellini with rock shrimp.  Her meal immediately drew the eye, with a perfectly colored, reddish-orange sauce that was bright and made your mouth water.  My wife took her first bite and her eyes popped open, proclaiming the burst of flavor was incredible.  I tried a bite and loved what I had tasted as well.  All in all, a very lovely dish.   I had the veal piccata and it was flawed? But I am not going to include this in my review until I give it another shot - to be determined!  I would love to give Rudy and Il Chianti another chance.  It was, however, only one bad dish.  But again, date night doesn't come often and testing veal doesn't come cheap.  I am going to chalk this up as (hopefully) a one-time bad dish by the crew.  But 90% of what we had was fantastic!",

The petite salad, which comes with a vinegarette dressing on it, was big enough for us to share and still not finish because of the size. The dressing was good. The french onion soup was delicious - it was kind of thick, with lots of onions, a slice of french bread, and cheese on top - nothing like the other reviews here say. The capellini al pomodoro was good with lots of flavor. The carbonara della nonna had more pancetta than my taste, but otherwise delicious. Chef Rudy came out and chatted with us for a few, which was great. He replaced the salad with dressing on it for a dry salad on request.   All was great, until the surprise on the bill - $9 for soup and $7.50 for the salad.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying I really love that this restaurant is locally owned and operated and not a big corporate chain. Nothing particular wrong with chains, but it feels good to support places like this and I wish there were more of them. The staff and the chef seem to really want a great quality restaurant and for diners to be happy with their experience.  All that being said, our experience was not a good one and there are serious issues that should be addressed in order for this to be a winning restaurant.  -The food: It was not good. We ordered 3 dishes and every one of them were under seasoned, poorly prepared and the quality of the ingredients were. The balance of the ingredients were off.  Amounting to food that was not worth the higher price tag. All entrees average between $20 to $25. Which is fine, but at those prices you expect food that is a little more elevated and of a certain quality. One of the dishes was clam pasta and it came out more like clam soup. There was about an inch and a half of clam just in a bowl of pasta. They served it with about a handful of clams in the shell making It too much work to eat the dish and hard to eat the pasta with bits of hard shell in it. It was an absolute disaster, embarrassing and shouldn't have been served.   Also, ordered a steak. It took about 10 mins after ordering and  the chef himself came out and said they were out of steak that it wasn't delivered as it was supposed to. If that was the case it should have been known at the start of a dinner service and properly communicated to staff and should not have taken that long to notice and allow to reorder.   At the end of the day the food had to speak for itself. The restaurant is only as strong as it's tastiest dish.    -The waiter: It started as we ordered the food. One person in our party asked to omit a part of the dish. The waiter seemed to be taken back and said \"you can omit it, but why would you\"?  As if it mattered why they wanted to omit it. The waiter insisted, seemed offended and said he would just bring it to the table on the side in case someone else wants to eat it. Okay...but it was strange. Then every time, literally every time he came back to the table he kept bringing it up as to why he insisted on bringing it to the table. It was just too much. He made it such a big deal and it made everyone at the table feel awkward.   -The chef: He was very nice and personable. I only know that because he spent 90% of his time in the dining area hugging, kissing cheeks and giving shoulder rubs. We were there about hour and he was out there almost the whole time. It felt uncomfortable and awkward how much time he spent out there greeting people that he may have known as regulars, but I don't know for sure. He also has a very large photo and write up of himself on the wall that see on the left of the front door behind the register. All this was very noticeable because it's about a 10 table restaurant. If he spent more time ensuring the food being served was quality before being sent out and wait staff was prepared and trained to handle common table waiting situations then there wouldn't be such a problem with the food and the experience.   The primary focus should be about the food not the person making the food. Otherwise, do you own a restaurant purely for self serving reasons or do you have a restaurant to provide an excellent dining experience worthy of the prices you're asking patrons to pay? If you serve tasty, quality food people will keep coming back. You won't have to worry about shaking hands and kissing babies.   Very uncomfortable experience and will never be back again.",

Made a reservation and glad I did cause there was a huge party also there that night. Everything we ordered was delicious... starting from drinks all the way to dessert!    First off, we started with chef roger's famous sangria. White & red were available. we got the red and it was a delicious start to our carb loaded meal!  Appetizers... we got fried calamari & onions and bruschetta. And of course complimentary bread & sauce. The calamari and onions were cooked perfectly and not too oily. The bruschetta was sooo good, lots of flavor jam packed onto one piece of bread.   For the main dish I got the chef special which included carbonara, chicken parm, and eggplant Sicilian. The carbonara was prepared in the cheese wheel and omg..... HEAVENNN. The heated cheese gives the pasta a Smokey flavor and adds more cheese to the dish. Who said you can never have enough cheese?! This was probably my favorite part of the dish, along with the eggplant. My boyfriend got the seafood pan roast with risotto. It was rich and creamy, kept you wanting to eat more!   For dessert, we got the affogato. Basically fresh brewed coffee over ice cream. Mmmmmm! we definitely needed a pick me up after alll that food.  Service was awesome, I really felt like we were eating at a family dinner instead of in a restaurant. I deduct one star only because they didn't have steak that my boyfriend wanted for his birthday dinner. Other than that... we'll definitely be back!!",

From the cheese wheel pasta dish everyone raves about (they aren't exaggerating!) to the beef tortellini to the best eggplant parmesan I ever had, this. place. is. amazing.  And, you know something, I'm not even writing this review because of the chef who is absolutely the most kind and friendly person in the restaurant business I've ever met.   So, what are you waiting for? AMAZING food (just look at the other reviews) AND the chef has an AMAZING character (he says hello to all tables, and remembers you when you visit again!!!!!).  Oh, did I mention they often have live music?   This is a whole in the wall restaurant that is THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD.   Take it from this UNLV Professor, A+ all the way around from food, service, price, ambiance, and more.",

    "text": "Okay Folks! Let's talk about this hidden gem of a place.  I really LOVE this place. I went for lunch which wasn't crowded at all. I think most people don't realize this is a lunch place as well as a dinner establishment. I would recommend that you go for lunch and try it out. I am sure it is just as good if not better for dinner but lunch was AWESOME!. It's in the same shopping center as wahoo that you can see from the freeway. I doesn't seem like much from the outside but take a chance and go in. The atmosphere is so relaxing and enjoyable. They have a Christmas tree up and they are playing Christmas music I think in Italian.....Just AWESOME!!! This is also a great place for Date Night. I recommend sitting closest to the kitchen. The server greeted us right away and took care of us with A+ service the whole time.   Ok now for the food. The Owner is also the Chef which I just Love! So many times they don't cook. This Owner is back there cooking....YES!  I ordered the Calamari and we also received fresh bread sticks. The Bread was AWESOME...so warm and fresh with the oil and vinegar or marinara sauce to dip it in. The Calamari dish also has onion rings with it.....Delicious. It has 2 sauces but I want to highlight the sauce that has a bit of a ZING to it. JUST PERFECT! There were 4 of us that met for lunch at this place but everyone kept raving about it. I had the linguini de Mediterranean...I think that is what it's called. My friend next to me had the Salmon and she ate that thing so quick....SHE LOVED IT!!! The other 2 people had the chopped salad and meatballs on the side, also the cheese tortellini. They grate fresh pepper and cheese if you want....SCORE!.  The Chef came out afterwards and spoke to us a bit after the meal. I thought that was a class act. This is a NON CHAIN local place to get a great meal and the cost was incredibly cheap for this type of dining. You just have to try this place out. Forget the chain restaurants and give this local restaurant your Italian taste buds....you will leave happy and the Italian inside of you will thank you. They have Pizza too and I have heard it is DA BOMB!!! As you can see I am JAZZED about this place and will be back. I can imagine bringing my squeeze here and nuzzling in the corner over some great pasta and wine in the romantic lighting, listening to some Italian Christmas tunes laughing and catching a kiss here and there. Enjoy it folks!!! Merry Christmas!!!",

Chef Rudy and manager, Rosemarie, are extremely warm and hospitable and make everyone feel like they are at home.   The food is all wonderful. My husbands favorite are the lamb chops with mine being the eggplant Siciliana. (I'm vegetarian) The complimentary garlic bread is delicious and addicting!   We hope to make it back in some time soon although it is pretty far for us now. What are the chances of Chef Rudy opening another location in the Southwest? Hmm....",

    "text": "This is a very good restaurant.  It is cozy and the cuisine is at points, truly marvelous.  If you are in the Henderson area, and crave Italian, I don't think you would have a bad meal here.  We ordered the bao appetizer, and it blew us away! Truly umami Asian flavor with Italian flair, on a mini sandwich with pork belly. There are just \"umms,\" and \"aahs,\" not words that can approximate its effect on the palate.  Other appetizers, such as the pizza (with real imported Italian cheese), were more in the modestly good range (as opposed to over-the-top amazing like the bao).  Don't overlook the superior salad.  The dressing was so interesting and good, and included nuts--a favorite.  My fish entree was truly the tops.  Sea bass with a mushroom risotto that showed such restraint, but finesse.  I added grilled shrimp.  Wow.  This chef has real talent!  My dining companions enjoyed their dishes (spaghetti bolognese and another pasta dish), but they were not over the moon, like I was.  Desserts were a more mixed affair.  We dug the Molten Lava cake, which was perfection on a plate.  The tiramisu was not our favorite, but we did appreciate that it was made in-house! The limoncello was a bit sweet for us, but quite interesting.  We preferred the spumoni gelato!  And the Cafe Affogato was wonderful.  (Can you tell we like desserts?)  Bread on the table to start was warm and a great start to the meal.  Did not appreciate the Il Chianti glass of wine...gave me a terrific headache.  But it did taste good.  We came on a great night because there was entertainment, which was very nice.  The guy has a velvet voice and a suave style.  Speaking of suave, the chef does \"touch table\" service, meaning he comes by to see personally how you are doing (and multiple times).  It is, in my experience, quite unusual.  You feel like you are a VIP!   At least one Yelper complained about the A/C.  It was a tiny bit warm, but it didn't bother us too much.  Sometimes it gets too cold indoors in places in Las Vegas. Nice contrast to have a truly room temperature restaurant so I don't have to wear a sweater.  This place is a bit too expensive to be an everyday or every week thing. But it is both capable of being a local hangout (for the monied individual), or a special place for those occasions you wish to mark.",

Their complimentary garlic bread is to die for! Sooo good and super garlicky and soft. The marinara sauce and olive oil with balsamic vinegar are equally excellent for dipping the garlic bread. Don't be too shy to ask for more!!! I had 6 baskets of the garlic bread with my family lol. We just love that stuff.   One of my favorite dishes on the menu is the Linguine Mediterranean. It comes with seared scallops, tomatoes, asparagus, and shrimp. I think it may also have truffle oil in it?? I love anything truffle. It's delicious nonetheless. The lamb chops are another favorite. Served on a hot sizzling platter, the lamb chops were cooked to perfection. They come with a creamy homemade wasabi aioli sauce that I couldn't resist!   I love this Italian restaurant! I've known Chef Rudy for over 15 years when he used to work for another popular Italian restaurant in Vegas. He was the head chef and always cooked the most delicious dishes. I'm happy to see that he's now opened up his own restaurant. I'm so proud of him! He's been feeding me for years and I highly recommend you check out this restaurant.",

When we stepped in the door I thought Louis Armstrong was playing on their soundtrack, only to realize ot was live music by a fabulous musician named Calvin. We were seated and immediately warmly welcomed by chef Rudy who was making the rounds. We began looking over an extensive menu of delicious sounding dishes. Our very cordial and knowledgeable waiter Roger came over and told us about some of their specialties and brought us some delicious warm bread with marinara and an oil/balsamic for dipping. This along with the nice bottle of cab started things off right. Everything was delicious! I have lived here in Henderson for 3 years and have been searching for good, authentic.Italian food, which I was raised on as a 2nd generation Italian. Finally my search has <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fended.at&s=6012c77ea8ddf9af5ffa763a326d55f59dd6d93fe6516cb3a91d3f59e81606e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ended.at</a> Il Chianti. While we ate, Calvin entertained us with a mix of jazz guitar and classic tunes from Nat King Cole, The Four Tops and the man, Louis A., not to mention at least 2 renditions of happy birthday to me! We declined dessert after stuffing our faces, but Roger brought us both tiramsu and 3 scoops of salted caramel gelato that he said was his gift for our bday/anniversary celebration! We came home with boxes of delicious pastas for lunch tomorrow and will definitely be going back very soon to this lovely, welcoming, and delicious Italian restaurant!",

The bread they bring out at the beginning was amazing! The bruschetta was also amazing. The pasta in the Chicken Angelo, which had a lemon butter sauce, was amazing, however I must admit the chicken itself was a little underwhelming. The kids spaghetti and meatball was very good, and the kids mac & cheese was out of this world! The Caesar salad (not pictured) which I normally could do without, was one of my favorite Caesar salads I've had. I can not wait to try this place again the next time I am in town!!",

    "text": "I hate to bash a small business, but our dinner was thoroughly disappointing.  First off, the beer that I was served had gone bad and I had to replace it with a mainstream \"water beer\" to ensure it wasn't old.   Our bruschetta had so much fresh minced garlic that it rendered it nearly inedible.  I managed to choke down one piece.  The lobster bisque, which is devoid of actual lobster, tasted downright fishy.  Not briny, mind you, fishy.  We both tried two bites to confirm my initial impression, and sat it to the side uneaten.  Lastly, the pear ravioli arrived.  While I'll admit the sauce was pretty good, the shrimp that were part of the dish were beyond disappointing.  They are most definitely of the frozen variety, from a bag.  At $28 (including the $5 share charge), I don't feel that the dish provides enough quality ingredients to justify the price.    We truly wanted to enjoy our meal, and only chose this place so that we could support local small businesses.  I'm giving an extra star for the friendly service.  However, based on this experience we definitely won't be back",

Dad started with the caprese salad - ditto.  For entrees,  the table had veal piccata, pizza,  capellini pomodoro,  the antipasto platter and tonight's special,  which was pasta in a cream sauce after being stirred in a 50 lb circle of cheese!  Homemade desserts of gelato and cannolis ended a delicious dinner.   Service was great and Chef Rudy spent quite a bit of time working the room.  We are going to come back for the next family birthday!",

    "text": "What can I say about this place. We had just moved out here and hadn't taken advantage of a good Italian establishment. After rummaging through the many Italian spots and reading reviews we chose Chianti's. Where do I start, well the service was superb. What made my experience great was when the owner Rudy sat with my wife when I and just had a great conversation about life. Eventually that conversation led to food and his history, which was interesting. When you talk to Rudy it's like he's been your friend for years and you just want to bring others around him to experience that.  On top of the great conversation he has an amazing staff that's very attentive and cares about the restaurant just as much as the owner does.   Now the food, WOW. Rudy is not only  the owner, but the chef. Pretty much everything he makes is from scratch. I had a seafood pasta dish that was full of flavor and sea food (scallops, shrimp, clams) and my wife had Lynn pear and cheese dish. Now when I saw pear i was hesitant,  but after I tried it , awesome, very delicious. Then Rudy came out again and told us about his Lemmoncello gelato, I typically don't eat lemon anything, but this dessert made me change my mind. He makes every part of this dessert from scratch. Everyone pretty much goes to a restaurant and never really orders dessert , but this one you must have.   Extras: So while we were there they told us about a free wine tasting in the beginning of the month. Now it's not extensive,  but they are good wines and you also get a discount on their bottles when you purchase for take home or dinner. We decided to take a group of friends and we had a blast. Even with a packed house Rudy managed to make his way to our table and have a conversation with us and we introduced him to futures guests at his place.   BOTTOM LINE: The ambiance is great, the views are awesome, the menu is perfect with options for everyone, the food amazing, and the best part is the owner had now become a friend. Anyone that takes that much pride in their restaurant I want to eat there. So the chances of me going back are preeeetttty high, like 100% high. People, try this place you won't be disappointed and when you go and Rudy comes out to talk to you tell him Zee sent you, the nursing student. Thanks for reading.",

The artichoke dip was different in that they served it already on individual pieces of toasted bread with cheese. No dipping necessary, and I liked that and it was good. The adobo nation was a tad bit sweet, and I wish there was more pork belly and the chicken sliced more. That being said, I still liked it. Everyone was extremely friendly, except for the waitress with black hair & glasses who couldn't be bothered to say hello when we entered. Whenever I saw her, she just looked pissed. The chef was very involved with his customers by asking about the food. He was a bit too friendly when he came to our table to wish me a happy birthday. He wanted to hug me once and then again when we were leaving, planting a kiss on my cheek. Awkward! I don't even know the guy. Maybe it's best the chef stays in the kitchen. The four stars are for the good food and the friendly server we had.",

The Chef/owner is very personable. He visited with each guest  throughout the evening. The GM, Rose, is very friendly as well. She provided top notch service and made the experience memorable. The food was divine. We enjoyed the antipasti, linguine with scallops, cheese and pear tortellini and the best HOMEMADE tiramisu you can imagine.The restaurant offers a limited wine list and they have a corkage fee. We enjoyed the experience so much that we are returning for my mother birthday and Rose is already planning a special desert for her!",

The owner came by to welcome us- very nice!  They gave us garlic bread sticks, they were ok - possible they were not homemade??  We ordered a coke $4- ouch! Linguini Carbonara $21  Chicken Parmesan $24  Honestly, the food was so hot, we had to let it cool down before we could eat. I had a few bites but burned my tongue and couldn't eat any more. We took it to go.  The chicken reheated well,  a bit too much garlic but that's OK.  The carbonara had way too much oil/butter & i didn't really enjoy it.  I think we will try it one more time. There were some enticing dishes listed on the menu...  Won't be bringing the kids with these prices though. I hope they do well, it's a nice place.  PS- they also had a man in the corner playing some music. He never smiled.  Cheesey old school touch but really pleasant to hear.",

Reading prior reviews about entertainment on the weekends I requested a table on the other side because of hearing issues complicated by multiple sourced sounds. Upon arrival Hostess greeted and seated us to a reserved table near the kitchen. Perfect for acoustics for enjoying the music from the guitarist.       Waiter and Servers were polite and efficient without being too intrusive. Served warm, tasty bread with oil and balsamic with our order of Pellegrino and a dry red. Unique combo of calamari and onion rings, could have done with only the former not the later. Still tasty just interesting and maybe a bit heavy for only two diners.       Wife had cioppino which had lobster and quality seafood, without being too spicy, not always the case in other Italian restaurants. I had the veal parmesan with pasta and a rich bolognese sauce. Of course both dishes are more Italian-American then True Italian but you eat what you like and like we did.       They offer some great deserts but as normal when we eat out we were stuffed and will have to try some of these on our next visit. Owner/Chef made the rounds to thank the patrons during the course of our meal. We will be back and take some friends with us.",

Everyone there, from the hostess, to the wait staff to the chef is just so very friendly and inviting. Rudy, the owner/chef, makes a point to come out from the kitchen to talk to his guests which is even more welcoming.   Tonight started with the bruschetta (again), the flavors are so good I have to keep ordering it every time to start the meal.  I had the cheese tortellini with chicken and spinach and my wife had the chicken marsala.  Last time had the pasta vodka, and I don't remember what I had the first time, but again, everything is top notch.   The place is a little small, but cozy is a better word as it is tastefully decorated and clean. Originally I'm from NJ so I grew up on Italian food and this restaurant would be on my go to list even if I was still in Jersey.   So if you are looking for a quaint restaurant with amazing food, a great staff and you want to impress your guests, this is the place.",

    "text": "So have been there twice, so far. This is a truly amazing restaurant. Fine classic Italian, owned and run by a bona fide Italian trained Executive Chef with many years experience at the \"big, fancy\" places. Although Chef Rudy is not a celebrity chef (except among real foodies who know their way around the town's restaurants) -- you certainly would think that he was a Food Network favorite based on his passion for cooking and demand for perfect quality. Every morsel of food on your plate is cooked and seasoned to perfection! We have had the chicken parm, veal parm (melts in your mouth it is so tender),cioppino (so full of seafood cannot believe it), rissotto (perfect), and even the chicken adobo (yeah, Filipino.) Did I mention that Chef Rudy is Filipino, as is most of his staff? A surpirse, but not an excuse. The food and service are better than any of the Las Vegas \"celebrity endorsed\" Italian eateries/snobberies. Chef Rudy does not just strut around; he acutally cooks and works the \"back of the house\" aka kitchen. He does not merely apply his name; he applied his TALENT. And he always finds a few minutes to come out (in his food stained chef jacket) to sit and talk with his guests. Yes, his guests, as in patrons, as in you! He cooks out of love, and it shows. You feel like a VIP in his bistro, not just like a credit card holder. Everything is so tasty; even the homebaked garlic breadsticks. The shrimp bruschetta is to die for. The staff is attentive; your water glass is always refilled, as is the bread basket. If anyone discovers a birthday or special occasion, better leave room for (complimentary) desert. We just cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. And the chef....  he got tired of working for others and so he opened his own place. But he does not let his fame get to him, and continually gives back to the community with cooking classes and all sorts of special events.  Great food, comfy restaurant, and first rate chef.",

My boyfriend had their onion soup and the linguine scampi, both delicious too  (I stole a couple of bites).

I came here for lunch with my grandma around 12:30 and there were a few other tables seated, but not many people in general. Our server gave us a table and promptly got our drinks started. We ordered bruschetta instead of getting a bread basket and it was outstanding! Seriously. I could have eaten all the bruschettas as my lunch haha, but I digress. The bread was crispy and sturdy enough to hold up the small mountain of tomatoes and cheese and vinaigrette sauce of heaven. Very delicious, a must. For my meal I ordered the penna la donna or something like that (I know, sorry) with a side of clam chowder. The clam chowder came out literally boiling and bubbling so that was interesting but once it cooled down below scorching it was fantastic. My grandma said it was just good, in comparison to everything else, but I liked it. My food came out and my lord was it huge and delectable! The waitress grated some fresh parmesan over the noodles, which were coated in a rich buttery garlic sauce with bits of meat (rasher? balogna? delicious!) and peas. It was super tasty but definitely filling. I felt like the portion was enough for 2-3 people so I only made a small dent in the dish before getting it boxed to go. We then ordered two cannoli, which were by all means ridiculously sweet in all the right ways, but it was too late. My grandma and I were stuffed so we could only eat half of one cannoli and we got the rest of our stuff to go. I guess I should mention, my grandma got the meatball sandwich with a side of fries and she said she had never had meatballs better than the ones in her sandwich. To say the least, she was pleased, as was I! The chef came by towards the end of the meal to say hi and check in, and inform of us weekend brunch with champagne. While it was a little pricey, it was 110% worth it! The servers and all employees we talked with were super friendly, welcoming and efficient. The food was off the wall good and the place is decorated very elegantly and had a relaxed but upscale atmosphere. If you are still reading reviews, stop and go get a table and eat away! :)",

    "text": "All the 5 star reviews made this place the perfect choice for my dad's birthday dinner celebration.  We were disappointed.  The caprese salad had huge amounts of raw red onion which were too spicy, hardly any tomato or basil and the burrata cheese was ICE cold (ruining the opportunity for it to melt in the mouth. ;(((  My mom ordered the Mediterranean per the server and I was shocked to discover that for $25 (which is expensive for a pasta dish) you get teeny tiny mini shrimp and teeny bay scallops, and very few of each.  It was mainly pasta, not homemade and not what I would consider high end.  Dad got the lobster ravioli, he said he could not taste the lobster and the shrimp on top were average.  He said not something he would come back for.  My eggplant parmiagiana was the big winner.  I loved the texture and overall flavor, and since that is a tough dish to get right, this is what earned the 3 stars.  That and the fresh bread sticks which my mom loved. The service was left to be desired.  It took forever to get water to the table.  After our food came out no one came by to offer fresh grated parmiagiana.  We stared at our plates for a while waiting,  Finally after 3- 4 minutes we had to flag someone down, and that was a challenge.  The place was 10% full so it was a surprise they could not provide better service.  I asked them to bring out cheesecake as a surpise for my dad's birthday. Our server came out with a piece of cake, a lighter in hand and just puts it down in front of my dad.  Then she starts talking about something...who knows what.  The candle was not even lit!  I just stared at her like - are you kidding me?  Light the damn candle and lets sing!  We all left full with a good amount of leftovers but not even close to a 4 star dining experience.",

My sea bass and asparagus risotto was beyond delicious, hubby had a seafood medley in a creamy sauce served over fettuccine he said was wonderful. Loved every bite and moment of this dining experience. Last but not least - Rudy. RUDY! He greeted each and every guest as if welcoming them into his home. He made frequent circuits thru the dining room to check on his guests satisfaction level. MANGA!!",

My husband and I were told it was best to have reservations on the weekends but the gal found us a table. We ordered and shortly thereafter I noticed the man seated at the table behind me had a small dog in his lap and it was licking the mans fingers.  I tried to mind my own business but noticed people were looking past me.  As I turned to look, this time he had food at the table and the dog was still in his lap eating from the mans hand.  I'm sure the dog enjoyed his food as much as I did mine.  I give the restaurant 4 stars for the food but the man and his dog was nasty and borderline dirty dining for this atmosphere. Not sure the stars will bring me back to risk dining with the dog. BTW the owner said he did not like the dog in the restaurant either but that was a regular customer and brings his dog all the time. Ugh.",

On our last visit, I got the Veal Bracciole and my wife ordered the homemade pear and cheese tortellini.  Both dishes were fantastic.  The staff has always been warm and inviting on every visit we've made.  The owner, Rudy, walks the room multiple times throughout the evening and checks on every table, which is not only a nice touch, but it feels very genuine.  The only negative thing I'd say is they absolutely have to fix their AC.  The heat in the restaurant was crushing the other night.  Other than that, it's a perfect experience all around at Il Chianti.",

The service here is just horrendous. The waitress would come out every 20 mins, the whole time my glass had no water. The hispanic bus boy was the best worker and he should be the waited instead of the food runner. The shrimp Bruschetta was great actually. My gf got the gnocchi and it was gummy. I got the angel hair and we got 2 sides of meatballs. The meatballs were braised in the sauce and had good texture but the flavor was horrible. I told the owner to add cheese in the meatballs and he said there was plenty of cheese in it. I guess i am spoiled cause i am from NY and know real meatballs. They could tell the meal sucked so the owner gave me a piece of tiramisu cake, i took one bite and there was a giant piece of basil right in the middle of the cake, it was actually disgusting. Also the owner said we treat everyone like we are family not just customers. I came in there a month ago and spoke to the owner for 5 minutes and when i came in on friday he had no clue who i was. Lol yea just like family. This was my last try coming here, 3 times and 3 bad meals.",

    "text": "The food is really good here.  I have only been here for dinner and it is delicious.  My husband had lamb chops and mushroom risotto.  He really liked it, I tasted the mushroom risotto (I don't eat lamb) and it was delicious.  I have always ordered some kind of pasta in cream sauce and it is really great.  The service is pleasant and good.  The musician is entertaining and supplies a nice back drop for dinner and never an overwhelming or too noisy effect, you can still hear others.  The only warning is the front door situation.  I recommend sitting in the middle or close to the kitchen, unless the weather is perfect.    If it is cold, every single patron holds the door open for long periods of time for other people and guests.  This allows huge gusts of freezing wind to come into the restaurant for 15 - 60 seconds at a time, or even longer because the door also sometimes is left to remain entirely standing open.  I literally had to get up and close the door about four times.  It really ruins your dining experience if you are in the 1/3 of the restaurant that is closest to the door.  Really bad.  Also, I went in there in Summer once and the air conditioner was broken, and I just left right away because I'm not eating food in the sweltering heat.  So, because it is a store front, and for whatever other reasons there are temperature problems here.    I suggest to the owner that the hostess (or someone) should stand by the door and make sure it is opened and closed quickly.  Do not leave the front door in the control of the patrons, they are not doing your place any favors. For a permanent solution, construct an entry way buffer/build out to to address the problem for the long run.    I wouldn't bother telling you if I didn't love the place. Good luck.",

    "text": "What a strange experience for me. I believe there must have been a full moon out when dining here for the first time.   We arrived for a mid week dinner.  Our friends made a reservation but I think we would've been fine.  It's a very cute and quaint dining area. We were seated immediately and someone was right over to get our drink order.  Here is where it starts to get weird.  The gentlemen with the water pitcher leaned over the edge of the table to pour everybody's water glasses.  I thought it was strange to begin with but it continued even through our meal.  I think our husbands didn't appreciate the gentlemen's tie in their food while trying to refill water.  I hope he learns quickly to refill them from the sides of the longer tables.  Continuing on...  I had ordered a Caesar Salad to begin.  It was a very generous portion.  It could've been shared with the 4 of us at our table.  I didn't finish it because of the size but it was good.  For my entree I ordered the Carbonara Truffle Risotto.  As I began to eat my meal, the chef came around to our table.  He took one look at my risotto and was very displeased.  He took it back so he could remake it the correct way.  Strange? Yes and was probably the first time that has ever happened.  But I appreciated him wanting his food to be made and presented correctly.  It was indeed much better the second time around.    It was definitely an experience I won't forget too soon.  I am willing to try it again with hopes of the kinks all worked out.",

All of us loved every portion of  the meal.  We had a date and mushroom appetizer, with light red sauce - more Asian than Italian, that was to die for.  I had the special - a sausage and shrimp linguini with a light garlic sauce.  Loaded with shrimp and sausage - just a little spice, and tons of flavor.   Sangria was also fantastic.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  We have eaten at so many Italian restaurants, and if not the best, certainly ranks right at the top",

I'm hooked and bringing my co-workers with me. I will be trying as many entrees on the menu as possible before I leave. Staff is affable and extremely helpful, when choosing what to try(live music on select days). Based off my initial experience, you won't go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely a rare find, I travel often and will stop in, as often as possible",

The lumpia egg rolls have fantastic flavor as do the adobo mushroom and dates albeit rich. I have had the cioppino which is fantastic especially if you spice it up. The chef is incredibly talented and can tailor every meal to your taste. The wine selection is fantastic. They have an incredibly fantastic pasta dish that is made in a cheese bowl drenched in fresh flavor. They have great specials throughout the week and on Mondays you can even book private parties to cook with the chef.    Make sure you put this place on your bookmark for any night out.

    "text": "A former colleague from New York was in town for one day with a group of Rotary exchange students and we planned to meet for lunch or dinner.  As it turned out, dinner was the better option so I started checking on Yelp for places in Henderson where the group was spending the night.  Il Chianti jumped out for its good reviews and I bookmarked the restaurant and I'm so glad I did.  I met my friend where the group was staying on Boulder Highway and Il Chianti was a mere mile and a half away.  Il Chianti is in a non-descript small strip mall that I've driven by many times on the freeway but never on the Horizon Ridge side.  We arrived close to eight and were seated promptly.  While looking at the menu, the chef/owner came by to welcome us to this small restaurant that was dimly lit.    We were told two specials and then we both ordered the lobster ravioli with blackened shrimp, asparagus, in a tomato vodka sauce.  The shrimp were very good.  Some of the lobster flavor was overwhelmed by the sauce but the ravioli were good.  My friend isn't a fan of asparagus and there was no problem substituting a different vegetable for her.  For dessert, we shared an order of cannoli.  I asked our server if they were pre-filled or filled to order and she said they were filled to order.  They were very good.  Service was very good, the staff was very nice, and it turned out to be a good choice for dinner.  Yelp comes through yet again.",

    "text": "So far this new local restaurant has been incredible! The meals we've had, the atmosphere and service pretty impressive for this quaint Italian restaurant located in the strip mall in the Black Mountain area of Henderson.   I got to admit when I first saw the sign for Il Chianti and peered into this restaurant, and saw the owner/chef was Filipino, I was a tad skeptical. Even after knowing he also was the exec chef at another local Italian restaurant.  All that went away though, from the first bite I had of a pesto dish and a pasta dish with clam sauce...omg..the flavors were poppin!!  Both Mr B and I are really particular of Italian cuisine and very few left good impressions. Next day I pleaded and dragged Mr B here.  It's a good thing other than seafood, Il Chianti offers, chicken, lamb and steak dishes.  Chicken Francese with a creamy lemon butter won hubby over, and Im addicted to the lamb chops with roasted figs on the anti pasti section.  There's a good selection of pasta to choose from as well as Chef Rudy's specialties. He also incorporated some Filipino food in there. The veggie lumpia/eggroll wrapped in lettuce with mint leaf and drizzled with a wasabi sauce is delicious! Even Mr B who does not eat vegetables, cleaned up that plate!  It's that good!! The flavors in all the dishes so far has been great!  Prices reasonable for lunch and a little higher for dinner, and can add up pretty quick if you are ordering appetitizers, soup, entree, alcoholic drinks and dessert. Worth it though!   The staff and service here rocks!!! And one reason that is the general manager here is none other than Rose who use to run Bernard's Bistro.   Hard to believe this restaurant used to house a fast/casual Mexican place...the transformation is 10x nicer looking.  Upscale feel with white linen on the tables, Frank Sinatra crooning in the background, just feels more classier than your average casual neighborhood joint.  There's also patio dining...with some very cool views of the Vegas Valley. Many people come up here to view fireworks, or tv reporters are seen here using the backdrop of the valley when they need a tv shot of the strip. I also recommend try out patio dining at the front tables during sunset. Some vino, delicious meal and tiramisu made in-house, you're all set!",

I wanted something off the Strip so that I could avoid the parking struggle, and I wanted something non-chain.  Not much above that was expected. I went with the first non-advertised restaurant that came up.  It was amazing.   The dinners we all chose were roughly in the $20 range. My kids loved the angel hair with their house sauce and the chicken parmigiana.  I had the beef tortellini.  The portions were HUGE.  (As in - my husband didn't come with us. When we got back to our condo, he ate part of the chicken parm, and there is still enough in there for another meal today.)  (My one child could eat bread sticks by the ton - and these came fresh out of the oven in a never-ending stream because she made it clear to the waiters to keep them coming).   The people who worked there treated us like family -   So sweet.  I really couldn't recommend this place more than I do!!!",

Breadsticks that tasted worse than Olive Garden. They don't even have balsamic vinegar because the reduce it into a sweet, disgusting syrup-like balsamic reduction mess.  Wine list selections you would find in a one buck chuck wine list at PTs Pub. All this for a whopping $8-10 dollars a glass. Boxed wine quality at its finest. I suspect these great reviews are from the owner's friends and family. Owner is non receptive to feedback, however, is overbearing in trying to glean compliments from you by visiting the table frequently.  Way overpriced-save yourself the time and the nauseous feeling and go elsewhere when you're in the mood for Italian food.",

    "text": "We went to Chianti to celebrate my mom's birthday last night. The service was impeccable, the ambiance was beautiful, and the food was top notch!   We had the vegetable egg rolls and the calamari for appetizers. The egg rolls were delicious. The sauce that was drizzled on top was what people from Hawaii call \"ono.\" The sauce for the calamari was also delicious.   I had the chicken adobo with risotto. The risotto was yummy in my tummy. I love the little bits of asparagus with the risotto. The chicken adobo was very tasty, a little to sweet for my liking, but still enjoyable. I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder but the kitchen was out of clams. I had the lobster bisque instead. The bisque was very rich and tasty.  My sister ordered the seafood pan coast and she let me have a taste. The pieces of salmon, scallops, shrimp with the sauce was so yummy. My mom ordered the seafood risotto and it was a heaping serving of seafood: lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, and squid. It was very tasty. My nephew and brother had the veal adobo and they said it was good.   Then the kitchen made a special dessert for my mom, ice cream and little fluffy donuts. The staff and other patrons help sing and wish my mom a very happy birthday! Thank you Chef Rudy and your wonderful staff for a delicious wonderful evening! Chef Rudy came and sat down with us at the table and talked about his passion for serving great food and providing a wonderful dining experience.",

Chief Rudy greeted us, sat down with us and told us a bit about the restaurant.  The spaghetti and meatballs was fabulous. I ordered from the Sunday brunch menu: lemon stuffed french toast, omelet, and fruit.   The French toast was awesome, crispy and filled with a wonderful lemon filling. (It was like a dessert) We will definitely go back on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner and to listen to the jazz for a date night. We usually like to eat out during the weekday when restaurants are less busy, so lunch or dinner, this will be our place to go to treat ourselves to great tasting food, friendly staff, and very personable Chief.",

A little too much for me to eat and as we were passing through, couldn't take the leftovers.  Our server was a little spacey--didn't have our reservation (but no problem as the early crowd had gone) and walked by with our check although we were only one of two midweek tables still there!  But the food made up for those little bits. Plus the music was great--Broadway/movie show tunes in Muzak.  So figuring out what was playing (if you are into that) was fun.

We had brought our own wine but it took repeated requests to get them to open a bottle and to bring wine glasses, not to mention that they broke the cork and half of it was still in the bottle. The server did not know how to fix this and had to bring it back to the kitchen.  He later turned up with 4 glasses of wine, poured in the kitchen!  He brought out the empty bottle and placed it on the table. When the dinner finally came they did not serve the ladies first .  The servers were very inexperienced and unprofessional .  We could see them eating through the kitchen window. When it was time for dessert and we asked what it was they were serving they did not know what the name was. Finally when the bill came we were grossly overcharged, being charged for infants in our party who did not eat anything. When trying to discuss this matter with the manager we were treated very disrespectfully, even being thrown the bill at the end.  The food was delicious and Chef Rudy was very charming; however it was disappointing that he was nowhere in sight when trying to rectify the bill at the end of our evening. Sadly to say the celebration ended with a very bad taste.",

The calamari was way over breaded you couldn't find the meat and when you did it was super chewy and no flavor not even salt or pepper. The meat sauce spaghetti had a terrible smell and tasted horrible like sweaty old cow. Gross! I only ate the breadsticks because I was starving but even those were plain and maybe frozen before. The worst was when I went in the restaurant no one was there. Should've been a sign I guess. The host waiter charged me $27 bucks for the crap and when I called to complain about taste they hung up on me. To top it all off I had my 18mo old baby on my hip and my 2 week old in his car seat hands full....she handed me the bag and said \"here you go\" I had to get the door myself and juggle it all to my car wondering what's that nasty smell I just paid $27 bucks for? Hoping it was good when I got home. Well it was not good. I'd give it No stars if I could.",

Rose the server and Rudy the chef made our visit pleasant and made us feel like we were old friends.  This a must for Italian food. I will go back often to try other things on the menu.",
