I'm a bit picky when it comes to food. She recommended I have the classic with fries. It was fabulous. With Brittany's service and amazing food, which is also affordable, I'll be making a visit again in the best future. I recommend anyone in Vegas to try this place out.",

So bad that not only will I never eat at this restaurant again, but I will never watch a show that has to do with mark wallberg again!  This place gave me food poisoning causing me to miss a trip I booked and losing me 100 dollars for that trip.   This place I found a few human hairs in my food and my lady found it in hers as well. The waiter didn't seem like he gave a shit about that either.   The menus were torn up and horrid looking, the location was sub par, and the service was horrible. We got seated and didn't see anyone to help us for 15-20 min when the place was extremely slow.  To the wallberg family, congrats on riding your famous brothers name to start a restaurant, but you are tarnishing his name so you should close your doors.",

    "text": "After our first hamburgers at Wahlburgers, the visits since have been disappointing and we will probably not return.  Upon two subsequent visits, we waited 30-40 minutes for our burgers and the place wasn't even crowded so we couldn't figure out why our meal was taking so long.  This happened on two separate visits.  The prices for a hamburger are outrageous $14+ and that doesn't even include fries or onion rings which are an additional separate cost.  We had the sweet potato tater tots and onions rings, both we wouldn't order again.  The sweet potato tots are sprinkled with sugar (which I would have preferred them plain) which made them too sweet.  The onion rings were not your normal onion rings and were instead small spiralled onion rings.  We ordered the salads which were okay.  The plastic utensils that come with them are terrible quality and the knife barely cuts.  The one time were were seated near the kitchen and watched as five different set of fries sat in the window for an extremely long time -- which accounts for their lukewarm temperature.  We ordered a \"thanksgiving dinner: burger to go, and I had asked for the burger to be wrapped in iceberg lettuce wrap (called \"skinny') instead of the bun.  We were told that they don't do this (is this a burger joint?) and instead told that they would put it with mixed salad greens.  When we got back to our room and I opened it up, they forgot the most important part of the \"turkey burger\" -- the cranberry relish.  OMG!!! If our hotel was closer, I would have walked back but instead ate my turkey burger salad without the cranberry relish.  That was the last straw -- and we will not ever be coming back.  Over inflated prices, and lack of attention to detail.",

The food on the other hand was incredibly poor and extremely overpriced, even by LV Strip standards.  1 burger, 1 chicken sandwich, 1 fries, 1 sweet tots and 2 sodas= over $50 with tax & tip.  Food was on par with any neighborhood McDonald's in relation to quality AND quantity.  Small portions of crappy food for exorbitant prices isn't really my thing.  I'm a Vegas local so I completely understand the Strip pricing, but for the quality of meal we received, it was outrageous!  You can get MUCH better food at the same price (or less)  at Bobby's Burger Palace, Fukuburger, Shake Shack or, of course, In-N-Out.",

We were told the wait would be about 35 minutes but it was actually only about 15, score right? Well that was the only good thing. We were seated and greeted about 3 minutes later by a super nice waiter, we asked for ice tea only to be told they didn't have any today. BUMMER. We ordered 2 waters and a cherry coke. 2 of us ordered \"the our burger\" one with french fries and one with tater tots, my mom got the \"dads basic burger\" with a side of thin crispy onion straws. Our wait for the food was about 20 minutes which isn't to bad except it was all ice cold and everything we wanted off or on our burgers was incorrect, the internal temperatures were also wrong. On try two, 2 of the burgers toppings were correct but one was still wrong and my burger was still raw and not well done so it went back a third time, when it came back it was all of the sudden a double cheeseburger with everything on it. I kindly asked for a takeout box to take it to my husband because i wasn't trying it a 4th time. I understand that they have been open for under two weeks but I refuse to believe it's this hard to get hamburgers correct, I mean it's a small menu and I refuse to believe that the kitchen is still working out the kinks. The manager did take my burger off the bill and then cut the remaining bill in half and it was still $23. The real total would have been over $60 for 3 burgers and 3 sides and one soda. Save your sanity and money and go to In-n-out!",

Actual wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad since most reviews said it took longer. Once seated, it didn't take long for our server to come take our drink orders and soon after our food orders. For a Saturday, I thought it would be much busier. Food came out in about 20-25 minutes and everything was cooked perfectly. I had dads' basic burger, hubs had double burger, daughter had chicken fingers, bro in law had the sloppy joe, and sis in law had the thanksgiving day sandwich. We also ordered the bacon Mac and cheese, and onion straws. Everything was delicious, we loved the flavor of the bacon Mac and cheese and the onion straws were light and crispy with good flavor. Service was great, everyone we had contact with were very nice and friendly. How much for all of this greatness? $99.00. I get that it's Vegas and Wahlburgers, but even though the food was good it wasn't something that I'd have to experience more than once. And not at that price. I can get a burger combo elsewhere for what the basic burger alone cost here. Let's see how long Wahlburgers stays open once In N Out enters The Linq.",

    "text": "If I could give this place a zero, I would. The hostess was not only rude to our party but as well lied to our faces and to her boss. She told us 30-40 min wait. We waited more than an hour.   I WOULD NOT GO BACK AGAIN AND TELLING EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT MY POOR EXPERIENCE.  The rude hostess at the front had blond-ish short wavy hair.  They told us her name was TONI. I have her picture posted in the pictures section in case they were lying to us about the rude waitress' name.  Two parties were seated before us (party of 7 and party of 9). She told us the tables outside were for our party. And then she gave it away to a party of 9. On top of that, she told us we were next to be seated when she gave away the other party after us our seats. Talk about terrible service to begin with.   I would like to think if a hostess messes up and then lies to customers and her boss with differing explanations of what she told us versus what she told her boss she would apologize. But she didn't  apologize and just shook her head at us while staring us down.   We came in on Sunday, December 4th at 1:39pm  Our dining experience: One person in our party ordered the OFD. They gave him the bacon BBQ burger saying it was the OFD even though we asked to make sure it was the OFD. We sent it back. They gave us a 2nd burger telling us it was fixed and it was the OFD for sure. They gave us the wrong order with the BBQ bacon burger AGAIN. So by the time he got his THIRD burger our party was already done eating.   Because of the problem with the hostess earlier,  what looked like person in charge told us he would take care of us because of it and do something to make up for it. They didn't really do anything to make up for it. Initially we were offered no comp or discount until we had to ask. In which case, by that time we were just over eating here.   The food here was pretty good. However, for the hassle we went through and the poor service that was provided, that's what makes up the bulk of my review.",

Then the lady with the check in machine said we couldn't go in a until we told her our name and how many people in our party. We gave her the info and walked in, but before we put one foot in the door she said we couldn't go in because we didn't get a text saying our table was ready. We had to wait outside which was about 54 degrees.   When I finally got a text, we were greeted by the host. He didn't say hi or hello or welcome to Wahlburgers! He said, \"I can't let you in until you finish your outside drink.\" So he just stood at his podium while I chugged my rockstar. He took the can from me and threw it in the garbage! Hey man! Have you heard of recycling?   The we were greeted by a nice gentleman. I think his name was something like Sicota. I am so sorry if I butchered his name. But he was so nice!   I ordered the \"Our burger\" first bite you already know the bread was frozen. It was not yet done thawing and they still served a burger on a cold bun. The fries had no flavor!   Ugh!!

Really juicy skinny patties which I liked. I got the regular tater tots. I originally wanted the sweet potato tots but our waiter brought us just tots. Still tasty though! Great place if you want good fast food with some Boston charm.",

However for three people ordering sloppy joe, the our burger, bbq wahl bowl, tater tots, fries, onion rings and 3 ice teas came out to $70.20. We didn't even eat the sloppy joes it was that bad. Maybe expectation were to high but we'll never eat here again. Way overpriced for quality of the food and smash burger is way better tasting than Wahlburgers.",

The food was unbelievably amazing! We also loved the drink menu and the souvenir up. The best part about eating here was the pricing. It is definitely very reasonable compared to a lot of restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip. The atmosphere was great, friendly, and very clean and tidy. The staff was great as well, thanks for making our experience a good one. We can not wait to make this stop again in Las Vegas or even the upcoming Chicago restaurant since it is closer to home.",

My wife thought I ordered it from the kids menu!! Its a small burger! C'mon now!!  And the patty was a bit skinny too. The fries were tasty, overall nothing to wait in line for!  A few days later we went to Chili's! Now were talkin'! I ordered the \"Sunrise Burger\" , fried egg and fries are included for about the same price!! Chilis gives you points to use on your order, received a free soft drink and dessert!!  Just like Lil John says \" What!!! , What!! \"  I think Chilis has the \"Right Stuff!\"",

They were so on point even as I looked around to the other areas where they interacted with customers. That was impressive enough to earn a 5 Star.  We got the bacon burger and fiesta burger. Not as medium as we'd like but it was all delicious. Fries were great, too! For the price, the fries should come with the burger, but it's all good.   Atmosphere is open and casual. The pop of lime green colors makes the place stand out. Little chilly in the evening for the bar area, but luckily it wasn't too windy in Vegas.   Thanks!",

This was a great burger! And the chili was great - you can see the portions were huge. The only draw back was this set me back $30, a little on the pricey side.

The staff was super friendly and the food comes out in a Boston minute which is about 5 minutes after ordering.   The mac and cheese was good but a bit to soupy.   The sweet potato tots with chili are a must try,the chili is well made and the tots taste like mini sweet potato bites.  I had the double decker minus the whal sauce and it was banging, prepared medium well topped with some of the best pickles I've ever tasted.  My fiance enjoyed the melt which she devoured within 4 minutes complementing how well it was cook and how great the mustard was.  Over we enjoyed our meal and would return only major downsize is the bathroom situation which is a good walk away if its needed.",

So this review will be solely for the food, not the overall atmosphere.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could because I ordered tater tots and they were rather greasy.  The burger though?  Was totally legit.  I enjoyed every single bite.  The house made pickles were SO good.  I would not wait an hour for a burger, but I've been wanting to try one of these burgers every time I've gone to Vegas since they opened.  Super thankful they serve them upstairs and I was able to get the burger without the wait.  I know that's kind of cheating but hey, what can you do?  Would definitely come again.  Maybe do an early lunch before the crowds show up!",

It wasn't opened earlier this year but they had a huge sign saying \"Coming Soon.\" I just happened to walk by this time and saw it was open. So I gave it a shot.  It's in a weird spot. It is accessible from the side walk on the strip or from Bally's Casino. From the casino just head towards the escalators leading to Las Vegas Blvd and it's at the bottom. Make a left.  From Bellaggio fountains cross the street towards Bally's and it's at that corner. If you are at Cesar's Palace or Bellagio Casino walk towards the walkway bridge. From their you can see the Green W and sign. However, it looks closed or not open yet from this angle.  Cross over the walkway, go down escalators and make a left. Pass all the small kiosk type shops. Then tucked in the back of this corridor on the right is Wahlburgers.       I had zero wait time. Walked straight in and had a seat at the bar. It's tight spacing and a bit crammed. The bar has huge garage style windows that open up so you can sit outside. It's November.  60 degrees with 40 mph wind. The nice bar gal and I were were cold. She was smart to have a hoodie.        Ambiance is very loud. Flat screens, loud music and the ice cream place across from them had loud reggae blaring. It's an open kitchen so that noise mixed in makes for a very loud dining experience. It's got a sports bar type of feel.       The menu is 100% Bostonian humor with a touch of their Boston accent. The menu is marked to show each of their favorite burgers including their moms.  They ran out of Empanada :( so that means I will return to try it. I went with The O.F.D Burger, Thin Crispy Onion Rings and Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  It's all Ala Carte and a lot of the menu sides are House Made.  The artisan bun is buttered, toasted and ready for a 1/2 lb burger patty. Add some bacon, saute'ed mushrooms, house made tomato sauce and slow melted Swiss cheese. Quality burger cooked to your liking. Good burger.      The Thin Crispy Onion Rings are a nice change up to having fries. It's got a light tempura type batter and well seasoned. These can become very addicting. The movies should offer this at their concession stand. One order probably last the entire movie. The sweet potato tater tots is also a good choice to pair with your Wahlburger. I could only finish half of my meal. It was a lot of food.  I also tried the Wahlburger Beer. It's spicey and hoppy.      My bartender gal was awesome and I wish the family more success. If you're in Vegas check out the New Kids on the Culinary Block on the Strip. Cheers my Yelp Funky Bunch :)",

Simply delicious!  Portobello Sandwich must be the best non-meat vegan sandwich I've ever had. You wouldn't even miss the usual meat patty. The mushroom was tasty and oh so juicy you'd make a mess for sure. This is something I would order again and again.   For side, the onion ring was very good. Instead of big  thick rings, they were small strands of battered onion almost looking like calamari. Love it!  Service was friendly, full of smile and attentive. Pricing was fair, a lot cheaper than flashy burger joints in casino resorts. I have no complain at all.  I will come again for sure. This place is such a good find.",

We sat at the bar and were greeted right away by the bartender who gave us excellent service the whole time. They have several big TV's around the bar, ideal for watching sports.  They have a signature \"Wahlbrewski\" beer on tap, so obviously we each had to try that. It was a  light brown ale, crisp & a touch of sweetness. Easy to drink, goes well with burgers.  My husband got the \"Our Burger\" (Paul's favorite) - a classic cheeseburger and I got the portobello sandwich as a chopped salad bowl (you can get any of their burgers/sandwiches chopped up and tossed with mixed greens for no extra cost - I love having this option!). All of the toppings on both of our orders were fresh and plentiful. We also got a side of the thin crispy onion rings - so thin & yummy! We both really enjoyed our meals!  Pricing is a little high, but I expect that for a restaurant on the Vegas strip, and we really enjoyed our experience, so that makes it worth it for me!",

Meat was completely dry and I'm pretty sure the only other toppings that were on there was mayo and a flavoring of stuffing which I would compare to how La Croix flavors their beverages.   I would have sent it back if I didn't already wait 30-40 minutes to get it during non-rush hours.   Service was slow and I almost went to refill my own drink.   If I were one of the brothers I would shut this location down. Found myself at White Castle north of Linq later in the night.  One star for working air conditioning, diet coke, and a collector cup",

Veggies dominated the taste with, I think a cucumber pickle instead of a dill.  The special suace seemed to be missing or wasn't that special.  Actually, the bun was the best part of the meal as it is sweet and soft.  Fries are seperate and sodas were $4.

    "text": "I went here just to say I tried it but the truth is I wasn't too impressed. The food was pricy, the establishment was snobby and post eating both my husband and my stomach's hurt (ordered burger medium well).  The food itself was good, but I can't say it was the best I ever had especially for the price of the burger/sandwich or whatever you want to call it.  We both tried The Melt (2 @ $12.95,ordered one fry-$4.95, and one strawberry frappe-$7.95. The total was $40!   I enjoyed the homemade pickles very much and the strawberry frappe was pretty good.   I say the establishment is snobby because they made us wait 5 minutes to order to-go outside in the cold when the restaurant was at what looked to me like 80% capacity at 8pm on a Tuesday. The bar wasn't full, and a couple tables were clearing up. Then it took another 15 minutes for our to-go food to actually be ready. Other customers also had to wait outside in 40 for about 15-30 minutes because that's how long the wait to dine in was.   I didn't anticipate the prices being so high. Menus online showed lower pricing and after wasting time waiting to order I felt obligated to just pay it since my husband and I had been walking the strip for a while looking for something to it.   Cool to say I went. Love Mark Wahlburg. Didn't love my experience at Wahlburgers.",

The following comments are my issues with Walburgers,  in no particular order:  side orders are served a la carte (french fries and burgers go hand in hand), the prices DO NOT match the little portion sizes of food.   The burgers looked more like sliders.   My brother ordered a sloppy joe.   I noticed the toasted bread was burned.  On top of the meat was some unidentifiable white 'string' items. I ordered beef chili and french fries.   In my opinion, there wasn't anything special about the taste of the chili.  It appeared the ground beef was placed in a food processor until it had the consistency of dog food.  No cheddar cheese or onions were on the chili.",

There are 14 locations, but only 1 in Nevada... and this one is located in front of the Bally's hotel and casino, near Starbucks closer to the casino. Their menu is simple: burgers, some salads, sandwiches and sides.  They even have a meatless burger.    The restaurant has indoor and outside dining, or if you don't want to wait, you can grab a stool at the bar, which can be both indoors and outside.  We were told the wait was going to be about 1/2 hour, but a spot opened up at the bar.  The down side of eating at the bar is there's no place for a handbag (if you are carrying one).    The food was very good, and quite filling.  Burgers are made to order, and the meat cooked to the temperature you desire.  I had medium rare, and it was just right.    The drinks were generous, but so was the price.. almost $5 for a soda.  Good thing it was refillable, and the cup was sturdy enough to keep as a souvenir.  Giving it 4 stars but pricey.",

It was a weeknight when we came by, but the place was busy. We decided to sit on the patio. The interior isn't very big and I can see it getting crowded on busier nights. Heat lamps were available for the chilly evening. Menus came out quickly and drink orders taken.  I had the \"Our Burger\" which is their basic. It'll set you back 9.95 (or 10.95 with cheese). I had it cooked medium well and that's how it arrived. The burger is good, nothing mind blowing.  I snagged a few fries from my friend, which were also standard. Drinks are served in a green souvenir cup made of a nice reusable plastic, a nice little keepsake. Service was good and efficient.",

At that point I figured lets walk just a bit more and hot up Wahlburgers. We watch the show and we are in Vegas so why not!  We managed to beat a rush by just a few minutes so we where sat right away. After a quick review of the menu we placed our drink order followed by our food order. I went for the thanksgiving burger, my wife went for sloppy joes and our son just a kids burger.  The thanksgiving burger. A turkey burger is not usually my first choice, but I was a bit over red meat at the moment and wanted something different. Man did I get something different! The patty was delicious and moist. The stuffing.....ummm ya can I have a bowl of that!!! Mixed in with the orange cranberry dressing, it all made for an impressive burger!!  My wife said the sloppy joes was great, and she finished off the whole plate. Even my son enjoyed his burger and ate all of it.   Overall it was a good experience and we would come back.",

    "text": "We were in town for my friend's birthday and she wanted to come because we love Mark and Donnie. We are greeted and seated very nicely and warm by the staff. TT came and was super nice to use. It was 5 of us. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We ordered 5 drinks, 5 burgers and some a la cart menu items. All 5 drinks came. 3 burgers came correct (the other 2 were fixed and came out later). At this point,  we still had a good time. The food was good food. The fries and onion rings are really good. We asked for refills on 2 drinks, we got them. We sat, ate and talked as girls do. Then one other person asked for a refill, no problem there. Then the waiter brought the checks, we asked for a refill for 4 of the drinks. The waiter then asked Carlos to bring us the drinks. While he took the checks to clear them out. Now, I am guilty for not looking at the check closely and just giving them my Visa card, as I trusted the correct items to be there. When Carlos brought the drinks, someone had just cleaned the table off so nothing was on it. He sat down drink 1, drink 2, then drink 3 and then as my friend reached for drink 4 he reached it to her and then snatched it out of her reach and jerked it back. And then said wait, how many drinks did you pay for. We answered all of us ordered drinks. He then sat the drink down and began to look at everyone's itemized bill (they just came back before the incident). When he got to my bill he noticed I was not charged for a drink and then began to verbally embarrass us implying we were trying to get over because we did not pay for 5 drinks (even though we did not notice that the waiter left it off the bill and clearly spent over $100). So my friend handed him the 4th drink back and Carlos quickly walked away. This did not sit right with me as we were just talking about coming back for dinner the next day. When I called to share the incident with the manager, Carlos got on the phone and said he was the manager! Out of order. I come to Vegas often and have been here a few times but this makes me want to stay away, as if we women can't afford a drink and don't deserve the conversation of understanding that is your drink was left off your bill then it is not your fault, I would have had no problem paying for a drink once we noticed it was not there. Instead we were handled very rude by Carlos which took away all the hard work of the waiter, kitchen, and staff.",

Veggie burger was $19.  Onion rings are small and stringy. Great for sandwiches but not good for a side order.",

I ordered the Our burger with thick house-made pickle slices, Wahl sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, and \"Government\" cheese.  I have no idea what \"Government\" cheese is, but it tasted quite good.  The burger was cooked perfectly medium and was very juicy.  I also ordered a side of crunchy tater tots and an Arnold Palmer that is made with homemade lemonade.  I only order AP's if the place makes the lemonade themselves, so I was happy to find that Wahlburgers does.  It was a little confusing to me to be served food in paper containers and water in paper cups while being served by a server.  It was a strange mix of fast food and sit down.  I wish I could have ordered at a window and bypassed the servers altogether.  Unless you're ordering alcohol, the servers don't really do much for you.  Different servers brought us drinks, refills, and our food.",

We arrived at the restaurant around 2:30p, and we were immediately seated. Our waiter quickly took drink orders while we took a look at the menu.   I ordered \"The Our Burger\" which is a 1/3lb burger, lettuce, tomato, cheese and the signature Whal sauce, and our group was up for us to order all the sides and share so that we could try all of them. So we ordered the crispy yukon french fries, thin crispy onion rings, tater tots and the sweet potato tater tots. I then finished my order with a housemade vanilla frappe.   With all of the hype surrounding the \"Whalburgers\" restaurant, I have to admit that I was expecting to be a bit underwhelmed with the food. Needless to say... I was pleasantly proven wrong! My burger was excellent, the bun was super soft and the burger was cooked perfect and served hot. For the side dishes I would have to say my favorite was the tater tots and my least favorite was the thin crispy onion rings (they more so seemed like they should be in the burger rather that a side). And my housemade frappe was sooooo yummy! Must have!  The atmosphere at Whalburgers was really fun and I really enjoyed the food. Looking forward to visiting again!",

That being said, sometimes you don't want the production of a big sit down meal. It was nice to have a quicker meal, but the experience was a bit underwhelming. I'm glad we went, but probably won't go again.   Pros:  -Food was pretty fast -Servers were nice -Food wasn't bad -Shoestring onion rings were awesome.   Cons: -They seemed to be having trouble turning tables. We checked in and we're told a 15 minute wait, but we could see empty tables.  -We're not actually sure who our server was. I don't think we saw the same person more than once. And it took them quite a while to come to our table.  -The Mac and Cheese was OK. It was enough food, but it came in a paper cup, so you felt like you ordered a side. I actually re-checked the menu, and yep, it was supposedly an entree. If it was played better I might have felt better about it.  -Sides don't come with the meal and have to be ordered separately.",

I gave this a 3 star because the food here was actually quite overtly oily.  The paper that was holding my burger was saturated with oil.  I could definitely feel the oil as well on the buns.  The onion strips or fries, forgot what they call them, definitely tasted like condiments you would put on salad, but oily.  The food and all was tasty, but that's probably because there is a ton of oil in the burger and sides themselves.  P.S. I like the cups they use for beverages.  Sturdy.",

Firstly I was not very impressed with the untidiness of the place,  it just didn't seem very welcoming, bits of food and waste on the floor. I sat at the bar and after a discussion with the barman I ordered my Impossible Burger \"Vegan\" which cost $18 I also ordered a Jalapeno Margarita which  $14 with a souvenir cup. (I did ask if I could order it without the souvenir cup but this is not possible).  My burger arrived and the first thing I though was ''wtf is this'' It was poorly presented and looked so dry. However, I was looking forward to it as I love Impossible burgers. I took my first bite and that was when I realized there was cheese on my ''vegan'' order. I pointed this out to the very pleasant barman who apologized and went off to get me another. Meanwhile I order my second Jalapeno Margarita. A short while later my '' vegan'' burger arrived. It turned out that the bun was also not vegan so I was presented with what appeared to look like cardboard on a lettuce leaf and slice of tomato. You wouldn't believe how disappointed I was.  I left Wahlburgers feeling very pissed off and feeling that I would have been better off gambling the extortionate $50 tab in a neighboring casino.  The one star is for the pleasantness of the staff.",

The food was as good as mark wahlbergs character in the Four Brothers... which was pretty damn good in my opinion! I ordered the OFD which is a half pound burger with Swiss cheese. I couldn't finish it. I like my burgers with a little blood in them so I got medium rare. Seemed to be cooked to that state!  Located in the Bally's Bazaar Market. Pretty cool area that I don't think as many people know of compared to the LINQ promenade or forum shops.  Service was extremely quick and friendly but it was kind of hard to request for the check because towards the end, they weren't really catching any eye contact or seeing us wave our hands around to catch their attention.",

The menu has several options marked by the family's favorite items as well as standard burger fare.  The mimosa and Bloody Mary were pretty and according to my friends, also tasty.  The burgers were alright. Nothing special. A little greasy.   The fries were decent. The onion strings were a huge disappointment, but the sweet potato tots were divine! Highly recommend!!!  The service was good and the atmosphere was bright and chipper.  It did take a little longer than expected for food, but it is what it is.  Would I go back? Probably not.",

First of all, it was 45 min to be seated, then another 10 min to get our order taken, and another 25 min to get our food. All totaled, 80 min before I took my first bite.  As for the food, we ordered the Thanksgiving Sandwich, \"Our Burger\", and Onion Strings.  The Thanksgiving was very dry, and I'm sure this was due to the ground turkey patty.  Not even the cranberry sauce inside helped with how dry it was.  \"Our Burger\" wasn't bad, but it tasted like something anyone could make at home.  At nearly $12, it should be more exceptional.  The Onion Strings were undercooked.  Lastly, though minor, there was no ice in my soda.  I didn't really get a chance to ask the young man as he seemed very rushed and busy.    In the end, I can now say I tried Wahlburgers.  I will only go back if I am ever in Boston, as I would like to try the food at the original restaurant.  As for the Las Vegas location, there are way too many other choices I'd make before I dined there again.",

It was a very busy Saturday afternoon but she was checking in on us at all the right moments, refilled our drinks constantly, and had any little request handled fast! The food was also great - everything we ordered was delicious! The only downside was that the hamburger buns got mushy VERY easily, but it didn't take away from the overall taste (just made things a bit messier). I would definitely come back here!",

    "text": "I can't believe I didn't yelp this review earlier.  I went to this location a couple of weeks back with my girlfriends.  We came to eat around 7pm where their was a wait for a table, but we were lucky enough to snatch four seats at the bar.  Service was great.  Our bartender was very attentive with our drinks and food. He gave us great recommendations of what is good for our dietary restrictions.  Burgers were fantastic.  One of my girlfriends who is a vegetarian tried their non-meat burger and she said it was the best burger she ever tasted.  When she looked at the table, her eyes shot out of sockets and didn't realize she paid 18 bucks for it. BUT she said she would go back and pay for it again b/c it was that good.  I must say, if you are a Wahlberg fan and have watched the show, there was an episode where they were trying to better their fries.  They still need to. Not up to par compared to other restaurant chains. I'm a big burger fan and fries play a key part of the experience of a good burger.  Fries where not crispy and lacked flavor.  Complete opposite of the burger.  Bun, meat and the extras were great. Had to knock a star on that piece.  Sorry, I'm a french fry nut! Overall, looking forward to visit again and try some additional things on their menu, especially their shakes!",

But no avocado :-(... Just avocado sauce. We got the tater tots which I was very excited about and they were pretty tasty overall, but I also ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was in a word... Terrible.  Honestly, I think boxed macaroni and cheese has more flavor.  I think they used cheese sauce, instead of cheese, and it had absolutely no flavor - at all, whatsoever.  The only thing that gave it any flavor at all were the breadcrumbs - But even then, not much. I left half of it, and I love macaroni and cheese.  Made me very sad.  And it was almost 8 dollars for the side order. Ouch. If mac & cheese is not important to you, this might be a good place for you to go LOL",

My better half ordered one of the speciality drinks just like it was written.  The waiter had to come back to ask how he wanted it. The menu did not have another option how to make it.   The waiter seemed to be very impatient over the confusion. The place was crowded and it was loud. Service was not the best.  I ordered the bacon burger well done  and Adam ordered the fiesta #burger medium well.  For $14, I expected a larger burger.  I also expected that when I squeezed my burger that it did not moo and bleed. Adam's burger was well done.  We had to  switch meat patties.  The burgers were just bland and #greasy. The fries like the burger needed a dose of seasoning.  We were half way done with eating when waiter finally came back around. When we told him that we had switched our patties, he said oh I can take them.  We told him no that we fixed it. He could have  discounted the food or maybe offered the #onion rings for free.   The onion rings by the way were amazing.  I finally got to go to Wahlburgers but I would not recommend it for anyone else.   #disappointed",

The first time it had a sauce that tasted homemade and then had melted cheese on top. This was the part of the meal I was looking forward to the most. The bartender did an excellent job of pouring me a perfect Guinness so I was happy with that.

While waiting two seats opened at the bar, which we quickly snatched.   Once seated at the bar, staff walked by and didn't even acknowledge our existence. After the 7 to 10 minute mark, we employed a technique that has worked in the past. My wife calls the restaurant and speaks with a member of management. She explained that we had been seated at the bar for some time with no service. We were approached a short time later by the manager who apologized for the lack of service. The bar staff apologized several times as well.  I ordered their grilled chicken sandwich. Be mindful that the sides are extra, not included with your sandwich. Our food arrived in a 5 to 7 minute time period. As I was looking over my sandwich, I noticed a small patch of mold on the bun. When the waitress returned I asked politely if I could get a different sandwich. They were very nice about getting me a second sandwich. The chicken sandwich was very tasty, with it's buttery toasted bun and well seasoned chicken.  When it came time for the bill, they removed my sandwich and our two drinks from the bill. I thought this was a fair resolution to the issues we experienced.  I will give Wahlburgers another chance. Maybe next time will be at one of their other locations.",

    "text": "So we decided to try a place for burgers we had never been to. This sounded good as they have gluten free buns and from what I read, Bobby Flay's place didn't. When we got there, I noticed the floors weren't clean and I felt like my mom when I saw that!!!! They want to get you in and out quickly but I wasn't ready to order yet. I ended up with their famous 1/3 lb burger on a gluten free bun. My bun was too thick and maybe they are afraid of cross contamination but it wasn't toasted or grilled which may have made it better. They have it down to a science because when I told the waiter I forgot to order to order cooked onions, the burgers were being set down on the table. He did bring the onions on the side. They make their own pickles which are quite mellow. I don't know how they do it but the burgers come really fast. Maybe they have the buns ready to go but we were so surprised. We wonder if the burgers are partially cooked but they use fresh meat and you can have it cooked your way! The meat was very good. My husband ordered sweet tater tots and they were too squishy to me. We ate at The Habit a couple of days before. I ordered a Char combo with cheese and Chris was going to do Chicken but tried the Burger Santa Barbara style which is on grilled sourdough and has grilled avocado and he had a drink. We shared my fries and the bill was under $18. At Wahlburgers everything is ala carte. The drinks are $4.95....not for a shake but a regular fountain drink but you get to keep the glass!!!! The bill came to $43.10 . Too much to me..I didn't need the cup!!!  Chris said his bun was good but I'd rather go to the Habit! We can't compare it to The Burger Bar as we had Foie Gras burgers the time we ate there and though we had a bad waitress, the food was great and the manager sent  us a dessert when we said the waitress never came back and didn't have anyone else cover our table. Gordon Ramsey's didn't have gluten free buns and that would have been better but the truffle parm fries were incredible..we tried them last visit. They have Shake Shacks and Steak and Shakes. I overheard a man tell the valet where we were staying that Shake Shack was greasy and back to In & Out for him!!!!",

    "text": "As a fan of the show, I was expecting a \"gourmet\" burger designed by a \"CHEF\" (Paul). Instead, I got terrible fast food. I really wanted to see what the \"wahl\"sauce tasted like but there was so little I still have no idea. The burger was so dry, I had to dip it in ketchup. Overall, my burger was tasteless and dry. The presentation was also not gourmet, but standard fast food.    At my table, everyone's fries were cold. There were only 5 of us, but it took quite a while to get our orders out and I'm guessing that's why the fries were cold. I had the lemonade, and it also wasn't good.   Service was on par with the food. We were mostly ignored. After placing our order, it took a long time and someone other than the person we placed it with stopped by and dropped off our food. We then only saw the waiter when he dropped off the check.    I work on the strip and warn everybody that mentions going there to change their plans.    All 5 of us that dined there agreed WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!   In conclusion: 1. Terrible Food 2. Horrible Service 3. Nothing Like the Show",

The cranberry sauce gave it a sweet taste and the turkey burger was actually pretty tasty and not dry.   My husband got the Our Burger and as recommended by the server, he got it medium. He said it was juicy and was very good.  If burgers are your thing then you'll like this place. I did expect the burgers to be bigger, but it was actually smaller than expected. The bun was also cold and I expected it to be at least warm.  We also had the grilled fluffanutta and ehh it was alright.. good enough for sharing. It had pb, Nutella and bananas warmed in between bread.. like a grilled cheese style. We got 2 special burgers, 2 double deckers, 2 sodas, 1 dessert, and a side of fries...total including tax was $75. A bit pricy if you ask me for a burger joint...",

This place had an outdoor patio but F that in the hot Vegas sun, no way! Maybe for the regulars but not for this Cali Girl. As you walk in low & behold a cut out full size Marky Mark poster. Great photo op for customers but WTH no Alma?? It was busy & hot, so naturally I ordered the spiked lemonade. I had a regular cheeseburger done medium, crispy onions, & tots. The patty is thick and somewhat juicy but not juicy juicy like I like them. Bread was fresh as were the lettuce, tomato, and secret W sauce. Overall burger was good. My nephew ordered a sloppy joe so of course I tried it & it was somewhat dry. It has piled high with crispy onions but had little meat. My nephew didn't even make a sloppy mess like he usually does. Up the meat & sloppy sauce Paul! Tots were crunchy and hot but the container was not full so either use smaller containers or up the tots. My alcoholic drink was never brought out to me just the water I ordered. I informed the waiter who notified the manager I think her name was Yadiria (misspelled) she handled the situation professionally. If I had to choose I would much rather have Shake Shack, sorry fam. But def better than In N Out!  #sorrynotsorry XOXXO",

Asked the hostess if they had high protein options and was assured I could order what I wanted without the bun. I ordered a chicken breast and a turkey burger patty. Both were good, but the chicken was FIRE!!! Moist and portioned at abt 4-5 oz. Glad I was able to enjoy eating out without feeling left out. Its busy on a Thursday but we goy seated immediately inside. Verdict? Coming back, if not for the Donnie posters alone.",

We ordered: Mac & Cheese,  Chicken Fingers, Crispy Haddcock Sandwich, O.F.D burger, and The Our burger.   The mac and cheese had no cheese in it.  Pretty much all water.. no favor at all... I really really mean this,  but the worst mac and cheese I ever tasted.  Kraft boxed mac and cheese is 70x better.    I got stabbed in my mouth with two bones from the fish sandwich.  The burgers had nothing special about them. If you blindfolded yourself,  You couldn't tell the difference if you were eating a McDonald's burger or a Wahlburger...   Such awful food.

I would not drive to the strip and deal with parking just to eat here, but if I were already on the strip, and Bobby's Burger Palace and Holstein's were both closed, and there was zero wait, I would come eat here again.   The Our Burger tasted like what a I remember a Big Mac to taste like, the bun was very soggy and it pretty much fell apart. Also, we asked for something to cut the burgers in half, but never for a knife so we used a  plastic spoon to half it, which probably didn't help.   The Thanksgiving burger was okay. It was a little bland, needed more acidity in the cranberry sauce maybe? Wouldn't order again.   Best part of the Mac and cheese was the bacon; otherwise it was on the watery side and also a little bland. Definitely not worth $8.95",

It came to us cold, with no cheese. Then Luke warm, then just warm. Never hot. And it was in a small foam cup. Everything there is in small portions and over priced, with cheap utensils. You get plastic forks, cups that look like they're from In n Out and the meal in foam cups. What?! I do not suggest this place at all. I could have went to Walmart and bought everything to make the meal, including utensils, for less. The Mac n Cheese by the way is penne noodles with cold cheese. A coke in a med size cup was $3.95",

The restaurant was pretty empty so we had to put our name in for about a 15-30 min wait.  We were buzzed back after only about 10 min so that was cool.  It's a weird setup inside, as you have to wait to be seated, but there is also a walk up counter to order?  Super confusing.  We were greeted pretty promptly and our server took our drink order.  A few trips back, we got 1/2 our drink order, with the shakes missing.  The shakes came about 10 min after the sodas came and they were pretty melted like they had been sitting.  The food came shortly after.  We got the BBQ burger (Donnie's fav), \"our burger\", kids hot dog, and kids cheeseburger.  My burger wasn't really hot and the cheese looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp for a long time.  The BBQ sauce was really good though.  Other than that, I wish we would have gone somewhere else.  It's not worth the price and the service was just meh.  You live and you learn.  Wished Shake Shack wasn't so far down the strip as we would have much rather eaten that.",

Since my companion has been in the fast food business for most of his life, he knows if something isn't what it claims to be.  There was a wait for a table, but we chose to eat at the bar.  The server was great, although the kitchen didn't seem to understand \"no onions\" on my chicken sandwich.  Had to scrape them off.  Place may be okay for tourists, but for locals it will be one and done, if they even try it. Plus it's hidden and not easy to find.",

It's nice to be able to order a burger for $11 instead of $20+.   I got the Our Burger with caramelized onions and no tomato with a side of cheese tots. These were both super yummy! It reminds me of In-and-Out just larger portions. Nice flavor, but definitely more of the fast food style of burger.   The reason why I gave a 3 is because the service isn't top notch and the food is definitely not super fresh. It's tasty, but it's really in the realm of fast food with alcohol. I love that you can find a quick place like this in Vegas for the price.   They could really make this place that extra level by having better service and communication.",

The staff was extremely friendly we got inside, took care of all our needs and the food came out surprisingly fast. This place is gluten-free and vegetarian friendly as well as vegan friendly. They do carry the coveted impossible burger-and I got to say, however that cook cooked our burger,  me and my husband had to double check because it tasted so real. I know the impossible burger is the same pretty much everywhere you go, but that whatever wahlburgers does they do it exceptionally well.  They have pretty cool cups that you can take your beverage out onto the strip with, which is just another little free souvenir but still cool!  Cant wait to get back to this place, but maybe not on a weekend though because it is pretty packed.",

We both ordered grilled onionson our burgers.   I am not sure if we should have requested not to put the raw onions on as well because we got both raw and cooked onions on our burgers. I was so hungry I did forget to take a picture of the burger before I begin eating. The burger was quite large in honestly hard to fit in your mouth to get a full bite. That is not a bad thing. However, the seasoning was lacking. We both found it necessary to add salt to each and every bite. While I  raved about the onion rings at the Detroit location I cannot do the same about the ones here. I had to send the first batch back as they were quite greasy and cold. The second batch came and tasted much better oh, but again salt what's needed. I ordered mac and cheese for takeout oh, we'll see how that goes",

The tots are great, but not $5 great. Even for being on the strip, it all seemed like a lot.

My only \"issue\" is our fries were cooked I think when we put our name in the guest list, I would use iceberg lettuce instead of Romaine, but I'm sure Chef Paul doesn't want to be the same as everybody else, but there is a reason why most people use iceberg, it's more crisp, and I got the end of a cucumber with stem as one of my pickles, we too make our own pickles and we discard the ends on purpose.  I get it, it's a busy joint with I would guess 800 covers a day so things come out of the kitchen sometimes not as planned. Not a big deal.  Also Wahlburgers guys put your name on the menu not just the \"W\" people do post pictures of the menu on places other then Yelp.  If you want a great burger come to Wahlburgers.",

So was completely floored loved this place atmosphere is awesome food is great had the \"our\"burger and wife had the original melt.  There's something about government cheese that just tastes so good.  Burgers are perfect size with a great bun.  The house made pickles and wahlsauce are great!  Also the lemonade is great.  Also had adult frappes I had the Irish Pick Me Up and wife had the Funky Monkey both great. Cool little thing is they take a free postcard photo of you that is free but you can buy other pics with frames it was 2 for 30 and kinda adds to the feel and atmosphere of the restaurant and what they are trying to do. Definitely recommend it and may have to eat here again before we leave just to try something different",

    "text": "Full disclosure: it was either this or a one-hour wait at Giordano's upstairs. Since it was 100 degrees in the shade I went with the option that promised immediate air-conditioning. That's the story of how I ended up on a bar stool at Wahlburgers.   Heat relief aside I had visited once before so I knew going in that this was a decent choice. There are plenty of other burger options on the Strip, but this isn't something I can get at home which puts it higher up on the totem pole for me despite the higher price point.  Owned by the Wahlburg brothers (yes those ones) the rapidly expanding food empire made its way to Vegas a few years ago. Apparently there's even a television show based on this chain; I've never watched it.  In Vegas you can find Wahlburgers and its logo in all of its neon green glory at Bally's. Like on my previous visit I got the Our Burger with cheese. It's a 1/3 pound burger patty topped with all the normal burger stuff.  The bun-patty ratio was decent and it was cooked medium as requested. The burgers have a good char on them and they're not overly sauced with whatever Wahl sauce goes on them. I can taste the meat and the toppings enhance the patty rather than overwhelm it.  I also got a little cup of fries which were mildly crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and judging by both the taste and the color they were freshly made.   I ordered a Peach Spiked Boston tea which was nice and strong. I might have had a few of these to avoid going back into the inferno known as Vegas in summer.   Wahlburgers is a good choice if you are looking for a burger that actually tastes like something. I've been pleasantly surprised with my visits there.",

Something I'm sure instilled upon the Wahlburg's themselves.   One waiter we've had two or three times though really stuck out to us. His name is Dakota. Literally the nicest guy I've ever met and the most polite waiter I've ever had at any establishment. Went above and beyond to make sure we got what we needed. Super easy to just chat it up with for a quick second. Was his demeanor in general. My entire family wanted to come back not just for the food. But hoping we'd be working during his shift just to get excellent service. Both times we had him we received exactly that. Kudos to you Dakota.   Now. Back to the food. I've always orders Donnie's favorite cooked medium. It's been cooked to perfection every time! It's a cheeseburger with government cheese, bacon and most importantly, jalapenos! My mouth waters just thinking about it! Keep up the quality and service Wahlburger's and we'll continue to come back!",

The wife got the BBQ bacon (Donnie's favorite). We shared a side of tots. The total was $43 post tax. A bit expensive but well worth it. The burgers were fantastic and everything I hoped it would be. The tots were tasty and the drink was really good.   What sets this place apart was the service was exemplary and they really do make you feel like family and it's not just for show on their show.

It wasn't any better than something I'd get at Applebee's. It's a high price for a novelty, even in Vegas. Go to In-N-Out and save your wallet (and tastebuds).  EDIT: we got charged $10 for two clubs sodas as well. $40 bill for a burger, salad, and ONE side. Ouch.",

We went during a weekday lunch so the place wasn't crowded and we grabbed a couple spots immediately.  We both went with the Our Burgers which is the standard burger.  The burger wasn't bad, I think the shredded lettuce and the bun sets it apart from other franchises.  We then shared some tots.  Overall the place was cool to experience for a fan like my wife, the service was great but it's probably not somewhere I would eat at regularly like a go-to place.  Definitely more of a tourist type deal.",

    "text": "Well, I found myself strolling along the strip with my three high school friends...still a little weary from the night before.  They had already started drinking, but at least it was beer.  We were in need of burgers...nothing better after a night of drinking...well, besides Chinese or food from a taco shop.  Since none of these were in sight, we decided to give the Wahlburg family a try...as did a good percentage of the strip...LOL!  We had to wait about 40 minutes, but that's what you get when you arrive at 12:30...LOL!  Once we were text, we were given a booth between the bar and the kitchen.  Of course, since they were busy, it took a while for our server to get to us, though he did say hi and say he'd be right back.  He took our order and delivered drinks, and then we waited.  It did take a while for the food to come out.  My burger was still hot, while the others were warm to cold.  The onion rings were luke warm.  Dave: The hottest thing here are the tater tots!  They probably came up last.  My burger was good, although the barbeque sauce was on the side which was odd.  The others said they were ok since they didn't come out hot.  Overall, it was a nice experience, but I don't think I'll come back.  I feel it's more hype than substance.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is chill inspite of being in Vegas.  I did think the government cheese was a funny thing...and some of the decor was pretty positive.  But for me, I'll remain neutral.  Check it out if your curious...like everything in Vegas, you should try everything at least once!",

Something that I would say is if you are getting one of the bacon burgers or a different more heavy burger, then I would add lettuce or something else to break it up because just like a lot of places it becomes too much. Overall I loved my burger and I would totally come back and recommend. The only thing that wasn't amazing was the Caesar salad but the lettuce was still fresh. Also the queso is excellent and I don't typically like queso. Would come back here and would recommend to anyone. Loved coming here after seeing it on the tv for so long!",

    "text": "Wouldn't eat here again. It's basically fast food with a top dollar price, for no reason.  Way too much going on... music blasting so loud that you can't even hear the person next to you talking. Is this a restaurant or a nightclub/bar?? I paid way too much tonight just to have a mediocre burger and fries.   I mean the burger had nothing special about it. I had 2 pickle rounds on it, which is something McDonald's does to me. A $10 burger should have a decent amount of pickles or a side pickle at least?  The bun was really soft and it tasted good but just nothing special about it. DEFINITELY not a $10 burger.   Everything is just rushed.  I'm especially upset about the Caesar salad - I REPEAT, DO NOT GET THE CAESAR SALAD. It's very hard to mess up a salad but boy that was the most watered down Caesar dressing I ever had! It's like they had regular Caesar dressing, then some bimbo decided to add another cup of water to it and drizzle that over the salad.   As for the service - our girl was okay. Nothing special. Gave me a weird vibe the whole time like she knew me and didn't like me, but smiled anyways. We still tipped her well. She checked up on us a lot.   The only thing that really ticked me off was that I asked if they did \"SIDE SALADS\" she said yes. But she apparently misinterpreted what I had said and got me a regular full size salad - again, probably because the music was so loud we have to scream at each other. So I paid $7 for the shittiest Caesar salad that I ever put into my mouth (and I didn't even want that much of it, I was expecting a small 1/2 cup of lettuce, not a full plate.... that's what SIDE salad means)   Also, the food runner girl didn't give us all of our food when she came out. She said \"okay, anything else I can do for you folks?\" Uhhh yeah ma'am you forgot all of our sauces that we ordered, and fries, and we ordered pickles on the side and you didn't bring any of that.   So long story short, we won't be back and will not be recommending this place to anyone. Maybe if I paid a decent lower price I'd be more easy going on the review.... but hell no. If I'm paying $50 for a couple burger & fries, it better be a damn good burger and fry.",

The Beast is appropriately named as it is stacks multiple patties with pulled pork. For those wondering, The Beast is 1 burger, not 2, as the menu could confuse you to believe. But yea The Beast has got my mouth watering just thinking about it....super flavorful and juicy...it's straight up dripping with the appropriate amount of tender fatty goodness. As for the onion strings, I'm just a fan of onion strings in general so when fried up right, I'm a happy camper. The Ranch and Wahlburger sauce aren't that good though...they have a strange flavor that don't complement the onion strings or fries...I'm sticking with the Heinz ketchup. Everything else on the menu might as well not exist since The Beast and onion strings are all I need. Enjoy!",

It is a casual dining place which is kind of nice - \"to go\" type cups with a top and a straw, and food served in baskets. Definitely a fast place to go in and out.   I got the BBQ bacon burger and sweet potato tots which were tasty. I'm not going to say it was the best burger I've ever had in my life or anything life changing, but it was pretty good. The avocado spread on the burger added good flavor, especially with the white cheddar and balanced out the jalapenos on it.  Our server Dakota was super friendly and efficient. Very good service. I'm not sure why people are complaining that it's expensive here-- $12.00 for a burger in Vegas is pretty cheap to me!",

Our server Ross I think that's his name sorry... is very attentive he acknowledged us that he will be with us asap from the moment we got seated.  The place is decorated with Movies, TV Shows and NKOB posters.  My fiance order the Double decker and I got the Donnie's Fav which is Cheeseburger with bacon and avocado spread.  I love that they asked how you want your burger cooked.  Was surprised that they give away the Green Plastic Cups if you do purchase soda with refills.  Had the sweet potato tots wasn't really a fan of that though.  All in all it was a good experience would probably come back with families from out of town for them to try it for themselves.",

I wouldn't order, little shredded sweet potatoes inside (I was hoping for a smooth center) but tasted much better dipped in ketchup and the onion rings were okay as well, thin and crispy.

Prices are ridiculous and really not worth what you get. For 4 people we paid $85 because each burger is 11-15 dollars AND THAT'S JUST THE BURGER. $5 for friends (and any other side) is just ridiculous. Especially because the fries come out cold and soggy. Really unreasonable and over priced for the low quality tastelessness. I got a melt with my friend and it was perfect. I have no complaints and neither did she. Cooked perfectly. Seasoned beautifully. Just the taste and the juiciness, so awesome. I would splurge just to get that again (with no side) However the other two guests I was with hated their burgers. They weren't as juicy and it was comparable to a fast food burger. I don't remember the exact title but one of them got a BBQ burger that had Bleu cheese sauce. And one got some Latin inspired one with heat and spice. I tried both and I wasn't impressed. When we gave them a taste of our melts, they were envious! We also had sweet potato tots which were very awkward and tastless. Overall, the melt is the only thing I enjoyed. I can't get over how much the sides are. You'd think with $12 burgers they would come with fries. Nope!",

Fine, if the food was to die for...but sadly the food was like a truck stop diner on the I-15.   Waitress was a doll.  Loved her.  My husband and I looked at the menu and were puzzled.  Where are all of the specialty burgers?  Where's all of the pizzaz???  I asked the waitress, \"Stupid question, but, is this the full menu?  I thought there were specialty burgers?\"  Sadly, our waitress notified us that this IS the full menu..all 6 or so burgers.  Nothing to write home about (except that they use \"government\" cheese and some Wahl sauce which on one seems to know what it is).  Ordered the BBQ burger with avocado.  Yuck!!! The edges had very clearly been pulled from a pre-cooked 6 pack of buns.  There were tell tale signs of the leftover bread tag from the other buns.  I grabbed it, and, the whole bottom was cold.  Yes, cold.  The burger patty was maybe 1/8 inch thick, crusty and bent, hanging over the smooshed bun.  There was maybe one slice of avocado on the whole burger and even less BBQ sauce.  The fries were old and dry.  The sweet potato tater tots were definitely pre-cooked and frozen.  Booo.  I really, really wanted to like this place.  Sadly, won't ever be going back.",

People talking about this is the best lol wow you obviously havn't been to a real burger joint.  Try Burger Boss or maybe even the Habit.    Then when it came time to pay, we asked for split checks and the waiter responded by saying they couldn't, because we didn't ask for it at the beginning.  Seriously?  We didn't know that.  The waiter also  automatically added an 18% gratuity for a party of 7.  I'm sorry, but bringing out fast food (not heavy dinner plates) does not constitute an 18% tip.  Especially when you're buddies in the back are the ones bringing it out.    Place is definitely not recommended.  Read the reviews people.",

That being said, during our 4 day vacation to Sin City, Wahlburgers was easily the best meal we ate.  Over $40 with tip is a little pricey for two Our Burgers, an order of onion rings, french fries and two Cokes, but we left feeling it was worth it.   We came during the end of the lunch hour and were told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table, but we could be seated immediately at the bar.  Sounded good to us.     As soon as we sat down a nice young lady took our drink order and then our food order.  My wife and I both feel that the hamburgers we ate at Wahlburger with all the \"fixin's\" including melted cheese, were the best burgers we've had anywhere.  The fries had some kind of special seasoning and were also excellent, so were the onion rings which in some places are called \"onion straws\".  They were thin and crispy and so delicious.    A really nice dining experience.",

In fact the entire experience from walking in the door to the attitudes to the cold food and very poor service just SUCKED ALL AROUND!!! One positive-the burger even cold had great flavor, which shows they could do it better if they cared.  **** UPDATE **** It's been over seven months since I've posted this bad review of Wahlburgers's in Las Vegas and still as of today I have not gotten one email response back from anybody with the restaurant chain so obviously they know the problems and don't really give a flip",

We also ordered a side of sweet potato tots, which were excellent. The atmosphere was also great. It didn't hurt that the place was plastered with Mark Wahlberg, who is definitely my wife's actor crush.

    "text": "We went in today on our way out of town back to LA. Unless you're walking the strip, access is inconvenient as it is in the outdoor mall at Bally's. You either park in their garage or we parked across the street on Flamingo at some other hotel. Any who, we finally made it there. We went in at 11:15am, no wait. As we learned it just opened 4 weeks ago, and it showed. No tea, no specials (although it is on the menu to ask your server). The server said specials were not available because they did not want to overwhelm the kitchen.   My wife had the BBQ as a salad. It was good but not cooked to her order. First, it came out as a hamburger (not a salad), and second it was undercooked (she ordered well done, and it was med). She also found something in her salad, and I think we settled on it being some thread from an apron. I had the O.F.D.. It was good, but I would get something else next time. We got the fries. Nothing special at all.   The table next to us ordered the mac'n cheese and returned it. No clue why, but how can you screw up mac'n cheese.   As of today, it appeared they were not ready to open, but wanted to open for the summer crowd. They did not even have the proper paper products (soda cups, containers for sides, etc.) They were using styrofoam, and generic paper cups instead of the paper products with the Wahlburgers logo.  We are going back to Vegas in December, and may return to give it another try. If we make it back, I will update this review. I hope it gets better.",

I didn't let the hot weather stop me from coming to this restaurants that's located outside Bally's Casino. I ordered The Beast Burger-- 2-5oz beef patties, \"government\"cheese, pulled pork bbq, onion, lettuce, tomato, and Wahlburgers sauce. That burger was bigger than anything I could shove in my mouth -- and so worth it! Flavors were really good. It did get messy. With the size of my burger, how could I expect it not to (eventually went to knife and fork mode to finish eating). Only minor drawback- the pulled pork was just a bit chewy. Other than that, loved the burger, loved the experience,  and the bartenders were on top of things and very friendly (I ate at the bar). Definitely gonna go back next time I'm in town.",

We asked 4 different people to check on the shake until it finally came out.   At the end, we mentioned to the gal who dropped off our check that the shake took unnecessarily long, hoping we could receive an apology for the wait. Instead she snapped at us with attitude stating that the reason it took long was because they couldn't find the milk - no apology. Than she decided to barite us with \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?! What do you want!!??\"   Taken back, we just paid the tab and bounced. We didn't necessarily want or need to have the $7 milkshake taken off the tab, but a simple apology and some common decency as your customers.   Would not recommend. Ever.",

I  came here after going to the Bellagio fountains and sat at the bar and watched NHL highlights at around 12 am.  .I sat there and played with my Rubiks cube. The bartenders were getting a kick of watching me solve it. I got one of the \"Adult shakes\". It was one that had Strawberry and Banana flavor for $13. The alcoholic component was some marshmallow vodka. It was very good. The next drink I tried was a Peach Boston Tea for $13 as well, and my last was an $8 pint of Angry Orchard cider. The bar was run that night by Richard, Courtney, and Almodovar. I was curious to whether that was really her first name, or if she chose that as a \"work name\" because she likes his films.",

Nothing to write home about.  2 burgers one onion ring order and 2 beers $40 before tip and tax.

We came in and they told us that it would be about an hours wait for a table because we didn't make a reservation. I ordered the beast which had pork on it and I specifically told the server twice that that I didn't want any pork on my burger. We waited a half hour for the food to come out and guess what? Pork all over both the burgers. She took it back no problem and came out 10 minutes later with this Atrocious looking thing, Gordon Ramsay would've been pissed. I don't care where you are in the world or what restaurant you are in you should NEVER EVER serve two patties and cook both of them completely different, ESPECIALLY on the strip of the greatest city of the world. This is the worst experience I've had since I can remember. The only reason this place is worth one star is because they have little con artists that come out with a camera and you can only pay in cash for them to take a picture of the table and give you a little souvenir. I definitely won't be back",

It's super busy, long line to get a table - so skip the line and sit at the bar! Yes, there is a full bar with seats outside (I've seen people sitting right next to their ton of luggage outside, apparently they didn't want to leave Vegas without trying this, or this is the first thing they came in to!). Either way, Marky mark and the funky bunch did a good job here, some of the best burgers I've had in a while and some of the best tater tots! Not too big, and not greasy, like other places that go for an easy please. The drinks service might be hectic since it's so busy at the bar, but the food comes out right away, which means that they keep it going in the kitchen when they have customers coming in like crazy. Great for a quick bite and a drink or when you want to enjoy a few with some good food while people watching.",

We finally found the place, were seated immediately. The waiter was prompt, greeted us with a smile, provided drinks quickly, and our order was filled quickly as well. A 108 degree weather day outside, our drinks were replenished several times during the visit, and we received bright green to go cups. I was disappointed in the \"famous\" mac n cheese with smoke bacon dish. I'm not sure if Alma makes her dish of mac n cheese with watery sauce, but this was too watery. It was more of a watered pasta they forgot to drain, added a little cheese to it and 4 kibbles of bacon top. Not worth the extra effort to find this location. I loved the staff, the interior, and the opportunity. I tipped our waiter well before leaving because of his extra efforts. I'll still watch the show. I don't think Paul would of been pleased or Alma his Mom with the pasta BUT the rest of the visit was nice. Thank you Wahlburgs",

We came on a Weds at 4:30pm, walked right in, greater by the hostess & we were seated with no problem.   It does have a restaurant/fast food feel to it as the napkin dispenser & ketchup are on the side of the table (condiment packets where at the ticket counter in view but you had to ask for them?) & they bring drinks in to go cups. We had the Dad's basic burger which was pretty plain with just pickles, the wahl sauce & onions (we grilled ours) & split an order or thin crispy onion rings. The sides don't come with the burger, everything is pretty much separate & aren't meal combos. We thought our burgers were great! We had the chance to really taste the meat since we opted out of adding any toppings to our burgers. Also, I wasn't expecting the onion rings to be this way but we preferred them since regular ones are too breaded, these we're light, crispy & very tasty.   Only thing was that we didn't really see our waiter, hostess was nice though & when we paid it was quiet confusing. Waiter gave us a receipt & immediately took off with no indication on what to do & if he was even coming back or where to take the receipt to. Luckily the hostess came up to us willing to help & took the receipt to the register herself. We will definitely be coming back thought.",

When we asked her why she told us the wait was 15-20 min and saw us walk to the bar right in front her and let us order drinks that we couldn't even consume instead of telling us the wait could be sooner. She was very rude in replying that it was our lucky day to be seated early. She also told the other seater that we were rude. The food was good and Freddy our waiter was nice.

Bun was clearly old and kept falling apart...finally I just ate it without the bun.  My friend had the same issue and told the waiter about it.  After speaking with his supervisor he came back and said the bread arrived fresh this morning...no way it was and if it was then it was sitting in a truck for days before getting to the restaurant.  After saying again he did not want it they finally relented and took it off the bill.    Also $5 for a coke because of the goofy cup you get to take with you...that everyone throws away...should probably be replaced with just a normal drink option.  Plenty of options on the strip so staying away from here for awhile.",

    "text": "First time here!!  It was beyond our expectations.  We loved eating here and we went back a couple times. I got the classic cheeseburger.  It was the perfect size and had the perfect taste.  it's hard to describe what makes a burger better than another, but this was probably my favorite burger I've ever eaten anywhere.  It had the right cheese to meat to bun to onion to tomato ratio lol  My boyfriend got the burger melt and he loved it.  The first time we were here, we shared the two sandwiches, but after, he stuck to the patty and I stuck with the classic cheeseburger.  We only had to get one order of French fries because the side is large enough for the two of us to split.  Two orders would be too much.  I love how a photographer comes around to take your picture and you get to keep the complimentary photo.  Sure, they ask you if you want to purchase more photos, but you can just say no. They were not pushy at all!  I'm happy and sad that I don't live near Wahlburgers.I would eat there too often if I lived close.  I look forward to being in an area again on vacation that I can grab a good ole fashion cheeseburger!",

After a short 10 minute wait, we were seated inside.  My wife had the OUR Burger and I went with Jenn's Chicken Sandwich.  I wasn't expecting much from this much hyped establishment, but my sandwich was very good.  The Jenn sandwich had a seared chicken breast, topped with caramelized and crispy onions, lettuce and a honey & garlic mayo.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, the onion strings and honey mayo complimented the chicken.  My wife's burger was juicy and tasty and she said she would return anytime for another burger \"fix\".",

It's located right in the middle of the Strip and has lots of seating and a pretty good menu, including kids menu items.  Pity that the burgers don't automatically include fries.  And for over $11 a burger, it's pretty pricey.  But I did have to say, the burger was very good!  I had the Donnie burger, which had bacon and BBQ sauce.  Great combo!  The service was good, decor was nice and again, the food tasted good!  A little pricey, but worth a visit for a fan!",

Like most burger joints it's cool And has a big bar etc., the usual advertising all over like the show.  I ordered the original burger (Paul's fav) w/bacon medium w fries.  I have to say I was underwhelmed with the presentation and size.  The bacon was \"over crispy\" (the burger does say  crispy bacon) but burnt bacon is diff.  The burger does have good taste, but the buns got all Mushy on mine pretty quick so you do have to eat it quick. The fries and tots were underwhelming as well as they are your typical type from any burger place no extra seasoning.  Drinks were good.  Service was good.  Would I go come again. (?) maybe if I got a gift card or someone else was paying.",

My husband doesn't really like avocado but really didn't mind it in this burger.  I had a couple bites of it and really enjoyed it.  If you like something with more textures then you might not like it as much.  The burger is packed with flavor, definitely a great BBQ burger.  I really liked the Our Burger, just a classic.  The patty was delicious and all the ingredients just came together really well for a nice clean burger (loved all the pickles).  All the burger goodness without the food coma.  I'm usually not a fan of thicker cut fries but the ones here really surprised me.  They were addicting.  Loved the food and would definitely come back again.",

For a restaurant that is supposed to be known for their burgers, I can tell you it was awful. My Hurricane was $14.00 in a souvenir \"glass\" - it was mostly ice and didn't even taste good, and the souvenir glass was plastic. The ONLY thing that was decent was my salad, and even that wasn't spectacular. I was very disappointed, and needless to say we will be crossing it off our list of places to return.",

    "text": "Before I start this review, a small disclaimer.  This is a review for the restaurant just after it opened and this is for the smaller Las Vegas location outside of Bally's.  I want to like this place.  Hell, I want to love it!  I am originally from the Boston area, I have watched the show from the beginning and I love the concept of the Wahlberg family starting their own burger chain.  That being said, we didn't have a great experience here even though we were really excited to try it out.  When we got there, it was fairly late so there was only one couple walking in, in front of us.  We thought, great...   no line when we were expecting one.  We sat at the bar area.  There were people walking here and there doing behind-the-bar things and saw us sitting there, but they literally chose to ignore us.  I don't know if it was the timing of our visit or they had had a long day or what, but I always give servers and/or bartenders the benefit of the doubt.  We had to have been sitting there for 15 mins. or more before we stood up and had to find a copy of their menu that was sitting down the bar.   This prompted one of them to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered a couple of beers and thought that would be the start of good service.  Nope.  We sat waiting until we finished our beers (another 15 mins. or more) before anyone came back over to ask if we wanted food.  We finally were able to order and our burgers did come out pretty fast.  Too fast it seems, as our burgers were both very rare although we ordered medium.  We were too hungry at this point - and frankly a little scared to complain - to send them back for more firing.  Again, I want to love this place and I am a very easy-going, benefit-of-the-doubt, Elite Yelper who doesn't like to complain but this type of service was really bad.  I am sure this restaurant wouldn't hire employees who simply didn't care or didn't know how to cook so I have to chalk this one up to bad time, or employees at the end of their shift who have had a long, tiring day.  The Good:  Cool restaurant design Wahlberg name Okay beer selection Great food presentation  The Bad:  Wait time Customer service Food not cooked to order  The Ugly:  Location (among cheap shops in front of Bally's casino) Rare burger meat when asked for Medium",

    "text": "Greetings! This review is more or less geared to Chicagoans as we're about to get our first Wahlburgers-- albeit in St. Charles, Illinois (Source: Kane County Chronicle, May 9, 2018), where no doubt people won't mind paying $10 for a basic Wahlburger and a soft drink. It was only that I happened to be in Las Vegas this week that I discovered the famous family's burger joint.   Located at the Grand Bazaar Shops on the Bally's property, you can't miss the old school diner-inspired git-up. Especially if you're staying at Bally's or any one of the nearby hotel/casinos such as Flamingo or Paris, I think it's a must-try.   The burger is very good, no doubt about it. Service here was also quite friendly and helpful considering the place was packed and super-busy. So much so that I opted to grab a seat at the counter; something I don't normally do. Have to say I was anxious to try my first Wahlburger. Obviously because I jumped in with both feet ordering the Double Decker. Good choice if you're really hungry and your tastebud receptors are craving quality meat, cheese and toppings.  The Double Decker consists of two 3oz burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, \"government cheese\" (haha-- American), signature sauce and pickles. Price: $12.95  Yes, regarding \"government cheese\" I can confirm via Wahlburgers Twitter account they describe it as like \"American cheese, only better.\" I just find it kind of funny, or maybe just a fun thing to talk about with your server after your initial perusal of the menu.   Anyhow, my first burger experience at Wahlburgers was I'd say approaching top-notch on food quality and pushing perfection on the whole. The only minor issue was perhaps the slightly longer than average wait for the food to arrive, but I'm certainly not complaining.   I give Wahlburgers 4.9 out of 5 on my own burger scale! I can hardly wait till they build their first location in Chicagoland. Meantime, looking forward to my next Vegas trip and another visit to Wahlburgers near Bally's.",

    "text": "DISAPPOINTED!!!!  My daughters and I visited the famous WAHLBURGERS, the atmosphere was nice, the menu was ok, but I was sad over my food.     I ordered the the\"BEAST\", my daughters ordered the \"OUR\" and The \"SloppyJoe\". The girls food was excellent however when my burger arrived the pulled pork was hard as a ROCK!!!     I showed my waiter and he immediately apologized and brought fresh pulled pork for my burger. But this is the FAMOUS \"Wahlburgers\" I'm at!     I expected a lot more in the food quality before being delivered to my table. After all this is WAHLBURGERS! I guess I'm disappointed in the fact I would never have expected hard over cooked food from this place. We watch every episode and love pride the guys show over their food, so it was shocking to see this our first time.      Well better luck next time I guess for us",

It would be fine had I not been taking it to go while staying at a hotel nearby. Dry bun with a patty that needed further cooking... all for the low price of $38 for 2 burgers and 2 fries. Had it been a great burger I could see paying the price, especially in that location. However.... Meh....",

The major downfall to this place is the seating. Its way to crammed in there where there is barely a comfortable seat. We had a booth but right next to us was a big party at a table. This would obviously be fine if there was space for the servers and customers to walk, but there wasn't at all. This meant every time the server came to the table next to us the server's butt was literally 10 inches from my face every single time. I assume all Wahlburgers arent like this and its jam packed because its a tourist trap in one of the biggest tourist cities in the world, but it really left a bad taste in my mouth.",

My husband ordered the Sloppy Joe sandwich, he did not like it at all. I took a bite of the sandwich meat and I didn't think it was bad at all. To me if tasted like a chopped brisket sandwich (BBQ). Also the onion rings a very thin shoe string style. He however said the Chocolate shale was VERY good.  My mom ordered the hamburger salad and sweet potato tots. The tots were good and small size bites.  I ordered the Turkey Burger with stuffing and a cranberry spread. Amazing !!!! All I got to say.. best turkey burger I have ever eaten. Stuffing was the key.

I was so excited to hear there was a Wahlburgers going in on the strip of Las Vegas. I checked the progress regularly and was very disappointed it was getting so many bad reviews. So we steered clear for a couple years. On our way to Salt Lake City from California we decided to grab lunch in Vegas and decided we needed to just go to Wahlburgers for the sake of saying we at least went once. What a surprise this visit turned out to be!   We were seated immediately. Our server took our drink and meal order shortly after. We ordered 2 cokes, 2 Our Burgers, Onion Rings, and Alma's Mac Salad. The drinks came in FREE souvenir cups. Pretty decent quality cup. Our server also asked to refill them before we left. The burgers were good. No real complaints except it didn't come with Wahl sauces as described but the server brought us some. No issue there. But those pickles... the real disappointment was not ordering extra pickles!! The onion straws were delicious according to my husband. Loved them! The macaroni salad was good. It was very clean tasting. It honestly tastes like home. Not some fancy Mac Salad you find at many restaurants now a days and your playing guess the ingredients. It was simple. It was good.   Definitely a pleasant experience. My husband said twice he would definitely go back. I agree... I look forward to coming back and exploring the menu some more.   The price... $60 for the two of us. A little more than I felt it was worth but it is Vegas and a commercial restaurant so you really can't expect anything less.",

He gave us great suggestions from the menu and we ordered:  The our burger with cheese Thanksgiving day sandwich  Sweet potato tots  Wow! I have to say that both of these were great choices. Juicy & flavorful hamburger and the ground turkey was also very flavorful. The sweet potato tots were delish but I do wish they were on the crispy side.

Definitely the best chain burger. Couldn't recommend more for a quick bite to eat at a centrally located restaurant on the strip.   We ordered:  The Our Burger The Super Melt BBQ Bacon  All delicious!",

We were given reusable cups with our drinks, a good little souvenir from the restaurant; that was a nice touch. Our waitress was very attentive and kept our  cups full all the time. She offered us drinks tho go. The sweet potato fries were in a shape of a tater tot and were soooo good! Definitely worth it!",

We had on our first visit the O.F.D & The Imposable Burgers with tatter tots and chill. Wonderful and filling with a flavorful amount of sexy combinations. The staff in Las Vegas are the best! Helpful and very friendly. I have to add the night before had Gordon Ramsey's burgers and were just not impressed even though we love his restaurants and respect his work. Paul , you blew his burgers out of the universe! We will be back as many times to taste your whole menu",

While a bunch of the staff was huddled in the corner talking happy to say I've eaten there but won't be going back which is disappointing because I was really looking forward to a positive memorable experience not a sad one still love wahlburgers",

My wife had the Dad's Basic burger and really like it by adding mushrooms and blue cheese. The sweet potato fries seemed to be left over from an earlier batch. Overall it was just average.

It was crowded, dirty, and they were trying to force a seated table system to a counter operation. So, it was a cluster, as you would expect. I was told I could not bring in my Starbucks I had bought while waiting outside in the 100+ degree heat (no inside waiting area) by the hostess, yet I saw several other groups bring in drinks. So, apparently OK for some, not for others. The service was OK. The menu items are ala carte and the fries/rings/tots are expensive and the portions are small. All three were served to us COLD! Yuk! The burger was OK. It was expensive! I can think of about seven other burger places I like better and every one of them is less than half the price and much more conveniently located. So, in summary, probably will stay in business due to tourists on the strip. For locals, it's a hard pass!   I hope the Wahlburgs read these reviews and rethink their Vegas strategy. They chose a poor location, the food is marginal, the service is not great, and the prices are too high! Epic fail!",

Very pricey (11.95) for an open faced sandwich with nothing else but a small paper cup of pickles.   The servers were very friendly and the service was good. However, the music was sooooo loud one couldn't hear yourself think let alone talk to others unless you were shouting.  of.  All in all, we will not return.

We sat right away and were immediately welcomed by our server Ricardo. He was very helpful with navigating me through the menu. I ordered the super melt without the sauce that accompanies this unbelievable creation. The most incredible part about this burger was the quality of the meat. I usually order it medium because you never know about quaily and it can usually go less or more cooked. My preference is medium rare. I explained this to Ricardo and told him I difer to you on this call. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. It was cooked to perfection. Perfect Medium Rare. My warmest regards to the chef. I couldn't be happier because the burger was juicy, extremely fresh quality meat. So much so that it stood out to me in a big way. While enjoying this masterpiece of a burger I was greeted by Eriet (aka, Angel) He stopped by to ask if everything was ok and if there was anything I needed. That's when I told both Ricardo and Eriet how fantastic everything was and thanked Ricardo for his insight ordering me that fantastic super melt Medium Rare. I will definitely be visiting Wahlburgers, Las Vegas again.",

My bf wanted to eat lunch there before heading back to CA and I thought I'd have a salad or something BUT then I saw they have GF buns and the impossible burger plant based patties (which i hadn't tried because up until February of this year weren't GF). Soooo I went for it: impossible burger on gluten free bun. Holy yessss! It was just beautiful  the bread was by far one of the best gluten free breads I've eaten in my entire GF life, the patty was delicious and the Wahlberg sauce: delicious. I requested no spicy tomatoes bc tomatoes aren't my friends but I'm sure they would've been delicious. The sweet potato tater tots and the raw pickles were the perfect complement. Being the burger fan that he is, my bf also agreed that his burger was one of the best he's ever had(he their staple burger w bacon and regular French fries). Lovely, prompt service. I was truly insanely pleasantly surprised at how allergy and dietary preference friendly this place is. All in all, amazing experience  I have to fast for the next 24 hours to get back in ketosis now haha but it was absolutely and completely worth it!",

We ordered food from here and sat down, a girl came over and said we could not sit down and eat the food we paid for from here because we had a takeout bag. I'm sorry, but we came in and bought the food and you say because it wasn't on a tray we had to eat elsewhere?!?!?!? I'm a food critic and she didn't even know this.  REGARDLESS, if you pay for the food and there are a lot of empty tables, we should have the right to eat here. This is a disgrace!!!!!!!",

The throw up sat there for a good 3-5 minutes before anyone made a move to at least cover it up. Meanwhile , still haven't been approached for a drink order.

It seemed pretty constantly busy. I guess the walburg brothers opened up this spot. I was hoping to see him, but it's not happening tonight. Great investment on his part.   I ordered a bacon burger with fries and my man for the melt. Food took about 20 minutes. My jalapeno bacon burger wasn't too bad. I give it a 3 star rating. The size could've been a bit bigger for $12 thought.  Fries: 3 star. They weren't hot, and for $5 the portion size was just sad. Flavor was ok  The melt: 2.5 star. The meat in comparison to the bread was imbalanced. My man ended up just eating the meat without the bread. He asked for no onions, but there were tons of c onions inside. He just scraped them out since he was hungry.  Overal I give it a 2.75. Portion could be a bit larger for the prices in meat and fries. More than likely won't come back. Just tried it out and didn't impress.",

    "text": "As with a lot of people, my wife lives the Wahlburgers TV show. I travel a lot and was in Las Vegas on Business and she mentioned I should try. So I decided, why not I had a couple hours before launching out of town, so I stopped in. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes but that was mainly due to it being a busy Sunday.  I had the Original Burger, added Bacon, and ordereed the Onion Rings. The food came out quick and at first glance looked really tasty. The Burger was cooked exactly how I like it, the bacon was crispy, not over done, and all the vegetables (lettuce tomato, pickles,) looked fresh and healthy. The onion rings came out in a separate Basket which is large enough to share with probably two other people.   The Burger was great. Cooked correctly, had lots of flavor and was close to something I would make at home on a grill. I had no complaints. The onion rings, were not as good as I expected. They were crisp, but really salty. I could not even taste the onion. The batter they use was light but so salty that is all you tasted was salted batter. Hence the loss of a star.   I would really rate this place a 3 and 1/2 stars. The service was a little light. I do understand the place was busy but my server disappeared after my order arrives and really did not check to see if I could use more water or anything else. I mentioned the salty rings and he just agreed, but in a way of like, \"awesome right.\" Not how I was thinking.   The real question, would I try again. Heck yeah. It was a cool place. I liked the Burger, the atmosphere and the vibe. It was really busy when I was there, so I can say light on service was understandable. The onion rings need tweaking, I hope that that is not how they are all the time.",

    "text": "Melle Mel and the Funky Bunch in da house!!  Eat big to get big!!  Pain and Gain!!    Wahlburgers is the new kid on the block when it comes to burgers in Las Vegas.  Unlike other Yelpers or The Other Guys that tried this place, I thought that my burger was pretty good. I didn't order straight from the menu because nothing really appealed to me.  I had this Sixth Sense that I wasn't going to be impressed.  So, I opted to build my own burger, which consisted of a 1/2 lb burger patty, one 5 oz grilled chicken breast, and a fried egg.  Yes, I did.  This is The Happening. This burger was huge and big enough to feed a King, maybe even Three Kings.  Taste wise, I was not disappointed.  The chicken was tender, the meat was flavorful not greasy, and the egg gave it that Midas touch.  Combining all three of my favorite protein sources together made for a Perfect Storm.  Although I enjoyed my burger, the food at Wahlburgers is not Invincible.  I also tried their Bacon Mac N' Cheese and the Tater Tots.  The bacon mac was just okay and the tater tots needed a little more work in the deep fryer. We obviously didn't finish the tots and left a couple of Lone Survivors.  Terri R. and Ty W. got their standard 1/3 lb burger while Lore D. got a delicious looking patty melt.  I could tell that everyone in our group was satisfied with their burgers.  I could feel the Good Vibrations.   The wait can be an issue, especially since Wahlburgers is located off the strip. We waited outside for close to 30 minutes for our table in 110 degree weather.  I wish that the restaurant had a Transformer outside so that they could at least plug in a cool zone for us.  Yes, it was hot and seemed even warmer inside because the restaurant is one big green house.  Price is one of the biggest drawbacks.  The cost for a burger is around $8 and my creation was over $12.   Besides the wait and the prices, the service was great.  Our server was very attentive and Management even checked on us a few times.  Free Refills?  Yes!  Free stickers for the younglings? Double Yes!!  We decided against dessert and Departed after we paid our bill.    Bottom Line...I originally came here expecting the worse, but left satisfied with both the burgers and the service. Peace!!!  2016 Yelp Review #42",

Sitting there waiting on our food, we wondered why some people had white paper cups while we had big green reusable cups, we find out when e got our bill! 4.95 a cup, we were not given the option for the disposable cups.

Hopefully your experience will be as good as mine was. I got the Our Burger. The burger was great and I did request it to be cooked medium well! One thing that was frustrating was we all ordered onion rings, which were actually more like onion straws, and they come in a big basket that we could have split two or three instead of everyone buying one. They were also a bit cold. Service was average and prices to be expected for the strip. The restaurant itself is really nice and well put together and gives off a fun vibe. I did not like how they put our whole tables ticket together as one then acted like it would be a problem to separate it into the proper bills. So we had to divide everything up and figure out who had what. Pretty annoying.",

But once we got there we checked in and they take your cell phone.  So we went walking around why we waited and got a call and text when the table was ready.  Menu selections were small and no Black bean burger which I could see and typically gravitate to since I do not eat read meat.  So I was between a salad, the chicken sandwich, mushroom sandwich or Thanksgiving Day Turkey Burger.  I went with the Wahlburg favorite Turkey Burger and a side of Sweet Potato tots to make my meal.  My friend got Chili, Onion Straws and French Fries.  The sandwich was awesome, everything worked together.  There is the cranberry sauce which gives it some sweetness that some people may not care for but I loved it.  The sweet potato tots were awesome light and fluffy.  The onion straws are a much get couldn't stop eating them.  The down side were the fried were just average would like to see some thick fresh cut fries because the other sides were so great.  It was a lot of food, would also be nice to be able to get a smaller portion of the side with the sandwich I was traveling for work and could only finish half the tots because the sandwich was so filling.  I hate wasting food so an option to put a handful of Tots in the basket with the sandwich would have been nice.",

She was very sweet and personable that's the only reason why we waited.  The service was horrible we were rushed through the ordering process.  The food came before our drinks. Not once did the gentleman  (I'm trying to be kind to your server because he certainly was the opposite of a gentleman) come back to ask how we were doing.  I actually went to the back of your house to get my own ranch dressing.   And your drinks are way overpriced!!! And what's up with not having a restroom in your restaurant?!?  So Wahlbergers... your name brought me in  but your service won't bring us back.",

We were a party of 8. Ordered a bit of everything off the menu. Our waitress was really great!!  The best part of my meal was the Spindrift ice cream float. That's it. I ordered a burger with no bread (I'm gluten free). When my plate arrived, it looked like a giant salad. Someone had taken the meat patty and cut it up into tiny pieces, like I was a toddler. Weird. The greens were fresh.But they didn't have any type of dressing or flavor. I had to hunt for the pieces of meat. The meat was pure grease. No flavor. I had also asked for avocado spread and extra pickles. I didn't receive either. They were brought out to me later. Avocado was fresh but the homemade pickles were vile! Someone made them incorrectly. I've pickled things myself and made mistakes. Seems like they got the ratio of vinegar wrong. They were not edible.  Overall, felt like I wasted my time, money and calories. With so many great places to eat in Vegas, I doubt I'll ever return.",

Both burgers were less than half eaten.    This is the first time that I've eaten at Iceburgers.  I'm a big burger fan.  I love good burgers.  Sadly, the quality of the food matches the quality of Mark's movies.  Less than mediocre.  They offered to cook up new burgers.  Too late.  You only have one change to make a first impression.  I lost confidence and didn't want to waste more time.  I was offered half off the bill and I accepted but a discount wasn't the goal.  I left feeling hungry and ripped-off by Fakeburger.  Las Vegas is a world class destination.  It's surrounded by the Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, the Flamingo, and Planet Hollywood.  We're not talking some trailer park outpost in the middle of the desert.  And yet they want customers to leave their taste buds at the door when entering.  Should have gone to Walgreens and bought a packaged sandwich from their fridge.  That would have been warmer.    Never again.    One and done.    Wanna-be-burger.",

    "text": "Being a child of the 80's and a fan of NKOTB  ... I was excited to finally try Wahlburgers.   Since it is new to the strip there was a bit of a wait ... 30 minutes.  We arrived at 7:30p and were sat at 8:00pm on a Friday night.      The set up is casual with the dining room  wood, steel, and black/white overhangs that have word references to the Wahlbergs.  There is also an indoor/outdoor bar.    Service was good, nothing spectacular.  While we waited we had a postcard photo taken that is complimentary.  Of course nothing is really free ... so we ended up getting two larger photos for a total of $25.00.  The picture person only takes cash, btw.   When it came to ordering, I had the OFD (I just wanted to say Dorchestah) and it sounded right up my alley even though Jenn's Chicken Sandwich sounded delicious.  My friend did order Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, though.  My burger was served medium rare and was quite juicy however that made my bun soggy. :(  Overall, I found the burger quite tasty. I left it as is and did not have any special requests.  My friend loved her chicken sandwich.  It was a flavorful piece grilled chicken according to her.   Sides are a la carte.  We both went with french fries ...nothing to right home about. Thin and crispy.    I wanted to end the dining experience with a dessert.  It was not meant to be, the Crispy Apple Empanadas were sold out or maybe no longer available?  The two remaining cupcakes looked sad and I don't do fluffanuttas.    Would I go again?  Sure thing.   I do feel that there could be improvements but I know it's a new opening and the kinks need to be worked out.  I do think the manager should do a tour of the dining room to check on the guests.",

The employees don't wear name tags and they just walk past you quickly or look the other way.   When we got seated and waited about 10-15 minutes before someone came to us and asked if we have been helped, we said no and his response was \"I guess I can help you.\" The only reason why my girlfriend and I stayed was because we wanted to try the food. Were we ever disappointed!  The burger toppings were ice cold and that made the burger patty room temperature. I asked for well done and it was still bleeding. I couldn't believe it! the check for 2 \"our burger\" combos came out to $45. We were clearly upset because I basically paid for the name  Never again will I go there. Terrible service, over priced food, bad experience. It's sad that one restaurant can probably ruin this franchise.   The menu was just plain. On the TV show you hear about the signature burgers of the brothers and I did not see anything. We walked from Luxor to Wahlburgers so we just felt so disappointed on the whole experience of our visit.  We paid and we walked out while all the nameless employees played on their phones and the bartenders were shooting rubber bands at each other. We went on a Monday around 10pm and the restaurant had about 20 guests. This restaurant needs to get some new management and waiters with name tags and or a dress code.",

They all went out of their way to make my daughter and I feel cared for (even the manager, Edgar). He personally came to speak to me to offer us each a complimentary frappe b/c they were out of Fluffanuttah ingredients. OMG, the frappes were so yummy. My daughter had vanilla and I had chocolate. She gave me some of hers... so I mixed the two together and viola... a party in my mouth!  It was late, so we shared Donnie's Fave (aka the BBQ Bacon burger) and the onion rings. Oh my jeezus... the flavor of the onion rings (more like onion strings with red onion) was super yummy, that they made my mouth water. The housemade BBQ sauce on the burger was filled with delicious spices (I LOVED it). The beef patty tasted like they used a higher quality of meat. The bun was slightly toasted and buttery.   Overall, the service, the atmosphere, and the food were superb. I loved it so much that I'm trying to figure out how I can eat there once a week!

Onion rings were the winner followed by the tots. I'm a tots guy if they are cooked right and by right I mean golden and crunchy. These were perfect. Burgers were juicy. Now understand when you go it is a bit pricey but factor everything in and understand what you are walking into. Just go and enjoy. You were gonna put the money into a machine or on a good burger. Burger is the way to go.",

Shame on you Wahlburgers to not produce a product that families can enjoy without going broke. In my opinion you have lost your roots and money is your object.",

Giordanos looked just too hot outside, Smashburger at Caesars having a huge line, Shake Shack just too far away, and needing to get a quick lunch, this seemed appropriate.   I ordered a Fiesta Burger. Honestly I'd have to say that the patty was really nothing special, which in turn just made this an ok burger.  I actually probably prefer Fuddruckers over it.   I ordered the shoestring onion rings as well. This was an incredibly large portion. They really just need to offer a small size at a reasonable price. Having a $6 basket the size of my face is really unnecessary for a party of 1.   The nice thing though was a pretty reasonable beer draft list and pricing. They had local craft beer cans for $5 which is pretty good for the strip.   Might not come back to this place.",

The burger tastes top notch but also is pretty standard so whereas it is delicious, it isn't super memorable apart from any other burger. The fries definitely stood out to me for some reason. They're lightly seasoned, a good amount, and just taste super fresh. I got a chocolate cake as well which, again, is delicious and pretty standard although it is quite large. It's on the strip so it's busy and you may have to wait for seating. It's on the casual side and l definitely recommend it when you're down there and in the mood for a good old fashioned burger and fries.",

Our server was the opposite...meaning great. Quick and attentive. Knew her stuff.   The Wahl...burgers They're arranged alright. They reminded me a bit of the burgers you can find at The Habit but the problem came with the meat. They need to get a new distributor out at their Vegas location because it just did not taste right. I don't expect kobe beef but I do expect a clean taste that doesn't end in a bitter note after the culmination of ingredients.   The fries were okay. No special seasoning or special cut, average. The alcohol choices were your normal things + 1 or 2 decent draft beers.   Although my experience wasn't the worst...with Wahlburgers in other spots around the country I would advise to try them elsewhere. It could be another example of the Whataburger problem...sucks in Arizona but amazing in Texas. So maybe sucks in Nevada but amazing in Massachusetts?",

I got the traditional burger \"Paul's favorite\" with added bacon  even tho it wasn't hot the taste was delish my favorite part was the bun. My husband ordered traditional with a double patty and an added egg \"double decker\"  We also ordered Lemonade it was so good came with green souvenir cups to take home.

He walked past us several times and never acknowledge us sitting in the booth. Most businesses the waiter will at least day he will be right with you or even say hello, we received no such curtesy. We ended up leaving after wasting 45 minutes waiting to give the business around $46.00 for two burgers, fries and cokes. Sadly, we will not return because there are other businesses that appreciate their patrons. It's a shame it has gone down in service still busy and making money but no longer concerned with customers, the personnel touch is definitely gone...I doubt they will notice even notice but repeat customers certainly will.",

    "text": "All that makes this place even somewhat significant is the owner(s).  Located in an area with fairly high foot traffic outside of Ballys Wahlburgers is the designated burger joint for the outdoor shopping area.   ATMOSPHERE:   A kind of bright neon green is the theme color for Wahlburgers, so its hard to miss and also a nice size with indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at around 7PM and the place was busy, the hostess was somewhat awkward insisting that we sit at the bar but we wanted a table, when she realized we weren't budging they IMMEDIATELY sat us at a table. Not sure why she was so insistent. But nonetheless, we sat and were still excited.   FOOD: I must say the full bar at Wahlburgers is the best thing they've got going. However I wouldn't recommend ordering a margarita (which is frozen and premade) it's very sweet. I actually asked for on the rocks but the place was somewhat busy so I didn't want to make my waitor do extra work.  I got the double decker burger and added  mushrooms with onion strings.  Other than my burger being cooked medium well which I asked the burger itself didn't taste like it was worth $14 at all. The onion strings  definitely looked better than they tasted, they weren't awful but I'd probably get fries instead.   Overall I'd definitely say just go to FIVE GUYS if you want to shell out a few bucks on a burger and if you want to go on the strip go to Burger Bar at Mandalay.  The odds of me going back are slim, Giordanos is the BEST restaurant you can choose from in the area.",

They called us after 15 min for a table so really deceptive about the 45 minutes. Here is the gist of the visit: Had a very expensive Bloody Mary. Good not great.  Wahlburgers special brew  was very good but for price average.  We both had burgers. Some of the best burgers we have had.  Buns were fresh, burgers cooked perfectly, condiments on them were spot on. Fiesta burger was excellent, hearty and not too spicy. Loved it. The basic burger my wife had was also very good.   Fries were hot and fresh and a Nothing special.  For the price we paid for all of that....well over $50....it's seemed expensive. Vegas burger places are just that.....expensive. I would give a 4 - 5 star based on burgers but overall it's a 3+. Would return again.",

My husband had Coors Light, and I had the Beer names for the Wahlburgs. This beer was a light brown Ale , very smooth. I would buy this in the store if I could find it in Chicago. Neither of us were starving hungry, so we split a Paul's recommendation Cheeseburger. We also ordered 1/2 fry and 1/2 tots. Our food was done in literally 5 minutes. They split the burger for us (thank you), fries were piping hot- but tots were ice cold guys. Sorry but you guys get a fail on the tots. Who wants to eat cold tots? Well,nobody does of coarse. The only other thing I have to say is when I picked up the burger to eat it, the bun was Cold. Not cool, not room temp, but cold. You need to up your game and heat the buns. I know this because I am a grill cook, and I put the customers buns on the grill, put it under a large lid, give it a squirt of water, put the lids back down for a few seconds. I really am a fan of your family, and music. Just would like to give you constructive criticism to make what you have better. I asked Summer if she has met you guys and she said only Donny, Paul was there and didn't speak with everyone, and Alma hasn't been there...you guys need to meet each and every one of your employees..and yes that means you too Marky Mark.

Nothing overwhelming, but many nice imagery and banners to look at in the restaurant.  Service: Nothing to complain about We were served in a timely manner and our server was polite.  Food: Very nice! Had the burger, onions rings, and macaroni and cheese. Everything was served warm, too! The burger was fresh and juicy. The onion rings, although not traditional, were still seasoned nicely and had their own type of soft yet definite crisp to them. The mac'n cheese was nice as well: seasoned and cheesy!  Summary: Worth a visit! If you're in the Strip area and want a good burger and some sides, stop by and get a burger here! They also have a bar, too!",

Oh my goodness, the mac n cheese knocked my socks off even considering they put the bread crumbles on top that I typically do not like, and the fries tasted really fresh.  The people sitting next to us ordered a burger and said it was hands down the best burger that they have ever had!  I can't wait to try the burgers! *salivating*.",

The Fiesta burger had the right amount of heat with jalapeno peppers and pepper jack cheese to spice things up!

    "text": "It was my friend's birthday so we reserved our table ahead of time for a party of 13 via telephone. Place was very busy considering it's located on the Strip in front of Bally's. So it was a good thing reservations were available to us. Our party didn't have to wait when we got there and was immediately seated to our table right next a mural of the Wahlburg Family lol.   FYI, it's so much easier and faster to just valet your car at Bally's because Wahlburgers is located just on the other side this a short walking distance. The only catch is that you have to pay $15 for Valet. This sure beats parking at the garage which is takes up way more time to get there.   On to the menu! It was very detailed and of course had their favorite item selections printed in bold for the curious first timers to share what the Wahlburgs like personally.  If you have young ones with you, they also carry Kids meals (Smahlburgs) with fries. And let's not forget about the Vegans as well. I recommend their \"Portabello Sandwich\" loaded with mushrooms and other veggies. ($10.95)  Most of the menu selections are pretty healthy choices considering most of them are burgers or sandwiches.   I went with their famous housemade \"Mom's Sloppy Joe!\" ($11.95)   Of course I had to respect Momma Wahlburg and experience her recipe because that's what a momma's boy should do. Lol I also recommend selecting the thin cut onion rings as the side dish. Did I forget to mention that when you order a burger, the side of fries comes as a meal.   Personally I did not like their \"Mac 'n Cheese with Smoked Bacon\" because it was lacking mostly the cheese. Don't get me wrong, all the ingredients put into this was delish but it's just not the same without the motherload of cheese needed. ($7.95)  To top it all off, I was still hungry for some dessert, so I ordered \"IBC Rootbeer and Creamsicle Floats\" all around the table. ($7.95 each)   I can't forget to mention that all our orders came out quick!! Our server and the cook behind the grill served up some hot plates so fast and accurate, I was very pleased!   Also, if you want your picture taken, there's a photographer going around table to table giving out small complementary photos for free and bigger photos for sale. don't tell anyone I told you this, but it's just better to whip out your own phones and have someone take it for you for free",

Our waitress was so knowledgeable of the menu without even having to look at it. She smiled the whole time and made sure we had everything we wanted. Just the hospitality was on point!! The food was beyond amazing. My husband had the thanksgiving turkey burger and it was excellent!! We also ordered tots, fries, fried pickles and Alma's Mac salad. All really good! I think the only complaint I would have is the ranch had too much vinegar in it but that's just because of my personal choice. Overall, amazing experience and we will be back again!",

    "text": "I have been really looking forward to going to Wahlburgers since I found out Las Vegas was getting one. We finally made it down their this last week. I expected a long line but we were able to sit right away at the bar.   My husband and I had never been so we wanted to look over the drink menu. The moment our butts hit the seat the bartender asked what we wanted to drink. We asked her for a moment, a minute barely passed and she was back. So we both rush and just order not wanting to keep being rushed. This was the first annoying thing. We wanted to see all the cool drinks they might have but she didn't give us a chance to read the menu.   Once we order the drinks we turn our attention to the food menu. Again, wanting to look over all the specialty burgers and such. Barely getting threw 3 burgers she asks if we are ready to order. We ask her for a few more minutes. She comes back with our drinks and waters and asks again. Again a minute pasted... maybe. So we just ordered the first thing we saw.   This was disappointing. We were being rushed, from the moment we sat down to the moment we officially ordered it had been maybe 4 minutes and this is with turning her down a few times.   The food came and it was pretty good. The bartender checked up on us and asked about refills. When we finished we got the check and was shocked at the prices. The beer was so expensive and apparently fries don't come with your $14 burger. The food was good but the experience was bad and the price was way to high for the food quality. I don't plan on ever going back.   There are so many other burger places along the strip for better prices or a better environment.",

When I finally got mine it was cold and burnt tasting.

This time I asked for a manager and got a supervisor of nothing. My bun was burnt so bad it was black and my patty was cold.  So disappointed that what once was my favorite place is no longer my favorite.  They remade our burgers and my bun was ice cold and hard and my patty was almost rare.  Just so sad to see that the hype on a&e is no longer what you get in person.  Maybe they should go back to basics of making a great burger instead of trying to be in every market or the world.  Insult to injury, just got our bill.  Was told the manager gave us a discount; but they dont have managers which is what the supervisor told me.  Our discount was a generic mall employee discount and then an employee discount.   Corporate really needs to get their act together.  A famous name will only take you so far.",

    "text": "I'm shocked there are so many 4-5 star reviews for this place. It's good, but it isn't Gordon Ramsay Burgr good. However, for the price this place is decent. I was excited to try this place because I'd heard so many great things about it. But, I didn't want to go right away because I knew it would be busy and the restaurant needed some time to get a seasoned staff in place.   This is a new location located in the Bazaar plaza outside of Bally's. It's a bit of walk to get to from the parking garage, but it was nice to explore the casino since I hadn't been there in so long! The restaurant was packed when we got there on a Thursday night. It was a 15-20 minute wait so we walked around.   FOOD: Once we were seated, we ordered the Mom's Sloppy Joe and The Our Burger. The burger was good. It's a simple one with 1/3 lb of meat with lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese with Wahl sauce and pickles on the side. The burger itself is good, but I prefer adding the Wahl sauce in it! The meat was tender and juicy. I think I should've gotten a larger burger so the meat to bread ratio would've been better.   The Mom's Sloppy Joe was okay. I think the food may have been waiting at the window too long because by the time we got it the bread was a little mushy. It's an open-faced sandwich so you can't really eat it with your hands, you'll need a fork. The Sloppy Joe tasted good with the crispy onions. However, I didn't eat it with the bread since it was so mushy. I think had it came out right when it was made, then that the dish would've been good.   PRICE for each was about $11-$13. So the meal with one drink was about $30 with tip.   SERVICE was decent for how busy it was. I recommend not coming here during peak hours. Expect to wait if you come on the weekends.   Overall, the meal was good. I wouldn't come back though. I think I would rather go to Shake Shack instead at New York New York.   Happy Dining,  J Tran",

    "text": "I watch this TV show, so of course I wanted to try this place while in Vegas.  We arrived at about 12:45 p.m.  they had a hostess outside taking names on their iPad.  Our wait was about 5-10 minutes for a party of two.  They are located in front of Bally's casino.  They have bar, indoor and outdoor seating.  When submitting our name for the waitlist, they ask what your seating preference is.  We asked for first available.  Our seat was outside next to the railing.  Downfall of this is people waiting for a seat lean on the railing overlooking the table.  Not cool while you are eating and conversing with your company.  It was a lil chilly too.  They had heaters outside, but those seated on the railing didn't get any heat.  That aside I ordered the Paul Fav burger.  Which is called the \"our burger\" on the menu.  The burger is very good.  They make their own pickles and I liked the flavor of them on the burger.   The cheese is \"government\" cheese which is what they grew up eating.  If you don't know what that  is, well that just means you weren't poor growing up.  I, on the other hand, knew exactly what kind of cheese they put on their burgers.  Burgers automatically have cheese and if you don't want to pay the extra price then you have to specify \"no cheese\" otherwise you'll get cheese.  Paul's special sauce is delicious.  The burger is well put together and fresh!  Everything is al a carte so you'll have to pay for fries, tots, onion rings, etc.  burger was $10.99 each and one order of fries was $4 ish.  We shared an ordered and it was plenty for sharing.  Fries were ok, nothing to write home about, but still good and not greasy.  We ordered Diet Coke $5 each which comes in a nice Vegas souvenir cup.  Overall, I liked my experience and would recommend Wahlburgers!",

It was very busy at lunch but they had a few outside tables left and luckily it was fall so the temperature was perfect. They have a pretty broad menu and I had no idea other than the hamburgers in their name. Yet I wasn't in the mood for a hamburger. I spotted one of my favorite items which is almost never on a menu, the classic sloppy Joe. The sandwich, which technically it isn't one as it is served opened on one slice of bread was great. The meat must have been better than what I can get at the grocery store as it tasted quite a bit less greasy in the sloppy Joe. They nailed it on the item. You get a choice of side and I went for the tater tots. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have any dessert which is listed on the menu for cupcakes that day. I usually don't get dessert but really would have liked to try one. The waitress did find a cupcake in a cup somewhere though not sure how and after all that effort I decided to try it. It was way too sweet for me though. The service was great but the price is a tad high even for Vegas in my opinion. But the only other burger option at Ballys is in their food court so this is a lot better and worth the money in that case.",

    "text": "After a night of drinking over at Bound at The Cromwell, I was hungry for a burger at around 2am.  But I didn't want to walk all the way back White Castle or McDonald's.  So thank goodness for Wahlburgers being nearby (actually across the street at Bally's where I was staying at) and open till 4am!  I had the Double Decker and opted for Yukon Gold Fries.  The Double Decker w/ caramelized onions (+$1)  -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2iqrH43&s=a7aebd8faadec0c4e8e474ef9633f2c072e3c7bada5a415d3119c1536781d636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2iqrH43</a> Two 3 oz. burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, \"Government\" cheese, Paul's signature Wahl sauce & housemade pickles. The burger was huge!  Definitely satisfied my craving for the night.  Though I thought the burger was somewhat lacking in flavor due to all those veggies.  I probably would've been better off ordering the Dad's Basic Burger which excludes the veggies.  It really was a mistake for me to order the Yukon Gold Fries.  Of all the types of fries, in my opinion, steak fries are an abomination and that's what these were.  So while it's not completely their fault they sell these fries, I wish they had a thinner cut instead.  They're just too thick and starchy for me.  I should've opted for Tater Tots.  Oh well.  At least my waiter hooked me up with extra Wahl Sauce to dip the fries in.  Overall, my experience at Wahlburgers was okay.  I liked the convenience how they were at Bally's and I had a cool waiter so no problems with service.  It's a great late night burger option, though more on the pricier side since I paid around $28 after tax and tip for a burger combo meal.",

    "text": "Went to whalburgers last Sunday in vegas. It was definitely a good place to go to. They were definitely busy busy, but the wait time was no issue it only took 5min to be seated , the waiter took our drink orders and came back for our orders when he dropped off the drinks and i swear we werent waiting but maybe.10 to 12 min. And our food was on the table. Awesome food. Only thing i would say is they definitely should try seasoning the patties,  but they were definitely still good, just needed some seasoning and it would be that final touch.   Definitely cant wait to come back and eat here. They give u your soda drinks in a souvounier  cup for 4.95 but hey that was cool. It looks like u can ask for it in a regular  disposable cup if u wanted to but really why would u want that? I love my cup.   This lady came to our table and took me and my husbands picture for something. Im guessing a board or something. Not sure but we didnt see her after that. She was going table to table so must of been something for the wall or something.    It was a pleasant dinner, the cost is worth it its definitely not overpriced like everything else is on the strip. The staff was super friendly and thats always a plus. Everyone was smiling.    Cant wait to go back.",

We approached the counter and asked for a table. We were instructed to find the host. While my husband and kids waited inside, I went back outside in the 109 degree heat in search of some assistance, but there was no one. After a few minutes I came back inside. My husband had found someone and was speaking with them to get us a table. He was told another family was (somehow) in front of ours, but if we waited to the side, we would be seated next. However, we were not, we were shunted aside a second time and another family was seated before us. At this point, I was livid. Whether or not it was the intention, both families seated before us were single-race families (we are a mixed family, my husband being Hispanic and myself Caucasian). I find it deplorable that in a city as diverse as Las Vegas, my kids had to experience racism from a FAMILY RESTAURANT! For shame!",

We were there as part of a night out prior to a wedding with the rest of our friends.  The service was terrible, most of our orders were wrong in that we were served incorrect items or things weren't customized as ordered (you know, no tomato, cooked medium) etc.  I ordered the onion rings because they are supposed to be really great.  They were terrible.  They were cold and had no flavor.  I mentioned to the server that the onion rings were cold and she brought new ones.  They were hot but still had no flavor.  The fries were pretty good.   The person running food out, instead of looking at the ticket would just yell and ask whose food it was.  The problem is that English was a 2nd language for him and nobody could understand.  It was also very loud because it's Vegas.  For the cost I would have expected him to be able to properly run food and look at seat numbers.  Maybe if I went to a different Wahlburgers in a different state it would be better.   Maybe because it's Vegas they take for granted that they can just act the way they did because they'll never see you again.  As such a huge fan (like weekly since the show started) I was very very sad. And disappointed for our friends who were there to celebrate.",

They had a steady stream of customers considering it was lunch time hours, but they weren't busy. We were seated immediately and our server got our drinks quickly ( non-alcoholic of course). We asked for suggestions from the menu and he kindly offered a few items. ( we didn't order any of them)   I chose the thanksgiving sandwich. I was expecting a Capriottis Bobby squished into a hamburger bun. When the sandwich arrived it didn't look like much ( so I didn't bother taking a picture). The first bite instantly let you know that you were dealing with fresh products. The flavors just stood out. It doesn't have nay overwhelming sauces or any other flare that makes it stand out but it sure as shit did taste like thanksgiving. There was a hint of cranberry beneath the stuffing which I appreciated. I also ordered the sweet potatoe tots. some places screw these things up with terrible oils or by over cooking them. These had a little crunch to them but were soft on the inside. I was pleased for sure. The server then offered us some of their Wahlburg sauce (I know it sounds funny). Its basically some type of mayo, ketchup, siracha mix. Not sure what else was in. Great for dipping fries or tots.   Overall I though it was nice. It was a little on the pricey side for simple burgers and such, but then again it is located on the strip. I would swing by again if I were in the area, but nothing made me feel like I had to go out of my way to come back again. The service was excellent, and I always appreciate that. That's why It got bumped up to 4 stars instead of 3. Thanks Rob catch you next time sir.",

Boy,,,,was I highly disappointed from the moment we arrived at the \"Restaurant \" the host at front door was less than inviting and even less helpful.  Once we FINALLY got to sit at the bar it took quit a while before one of the 5 people behind the bar to greet us let alone ask what we would like to drink. It took equally as long to take our order of food. With great expectations we waited and waited to finall y receive \"Our Burger\" /Sloppy Joe/ salad and forgotten tots. I couldn't help but be so sad and laugh at how ridiculous. Waitress was more concerned with chatting with the other 4 to 5 people behind the bar.  Prices are to high for what you get and even higher for food that is high school cafeteria level.  I can not believe this is the standards the Wahlburgers want.....  I think the bothers need to come out here and straighten manage and staff out ASAP. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make it right !!",

The 5 star rating is for the way that Tina Siereveld (director of customer relations for Wahlburgers) took charge &  handled this unfortunate situation. She actually personally called me (sort of unheard of in today's tech-obsessed society where most everything is handled through email). She apologized profusely & made no excuses (another refreshing act in today's day & age). I did also receive an email from Jr (manager at wahlburgers-las vegas). Both actions were much appreciated & because of the way this was handled, the next time we have the opportunity to go to Wahlburgers, we will give it another chance. Thank you to Tina & Jr.!!!",

First of all there is only one way in and out, very awkward because they take your cell phone number to page you when a table is available.  There isn't anywhere to sit while you wait outside and the area outside the restaurant is smoky, noisy and full of drunks.  The food:   Ehh. I've had much better burgers for way less expensive.  It was so loud in the restaurant: music playing outside, music playing inside, drunk idiots yelling and screaming.  I had to yell my order to the waiter.  My family was not able to talk to each other without yelling because it was so loud in the restaurant.  No drink refills or offer to refill.  The burgers were so so.  3 burgers, 3 soft drinks, an order of tater tots and an order of fries.  $65.00.   Sorry Mark, Paul, Donnie and Elma,  love your show, but won't be going back to Wahlburgers again.  Too bad, we were really looking forward to it also.  Bottom line: disappointing, don't waste your time or money eating here.",

First it took 45 minutes to get a table and I say this because when we got seated, every table was EMPTY! Then it took even longer than that to get our food. Unfortunately, more disappointment - the fries tasted like a day old and the burgers had more grease than a bottle of Weston. 4 out of 5 of us had tummy aches immediately after our dinner. And the FINALE - someone came in and was seated right behind us. They were INSTANTLY catered to and had their food about 5 minutes after they sat down. Found out from our waitress that he was the owners son because she apologized \"when it came to tip time\" that the service was not as great due to someone basically more important came in... Yet it was the first day of their soft opening - don't think I'll be back. From the food to service - so bad! #bummed",

I have to give this 1 star to post this review but I wouldn't have given them any. After waiting 40 minutes to get in, my family and I were seated in a corner to fend for ourselves. Waiting for 10 minutes, we finally waved a waiter down to bring us menus and water. The menu only had a few options and the prices were ridiculous. We ordered the $13.00 bugers and $4.95 fries. Our food came and 2 employees argued with each other right in front of us over whose order was whose. Onto the food. The fries and tater tots were cold. They made 2 of the burgers wrong and mine was so salty I couldn't even eat it. We again got the attention of our waiter and he made no attempt to make it right. We then asked to speak to the Manager. After another 15 minutes, she came over and we shared our experience with her. She offered new burgers but after everything else that already happened, we were over it. She did take 1 burger off of our bill however; this overall experience was terrible. It's too pricey for burgers you can't even eat. My sister lives in Vegas and told us not to go. We should have listened and would have been better off at McDonalds. Totally disappointed. I watched an episode of Whalburgers were Paul was hand  picking employees for this location. Was that scripted like the rest of their show?",

Got a booth, got our water, ordered our food and drinks fairly quickly, good start, wouldn't last. It took some time to get our drinks, some time later food would arrive. We all ordered burgers, two with bacon. I usually hate the \"how was your food\" interruption that comes as I'm eating my first bite, but will never take that for granted again. Our waiter, all waiters seemed to disappear for at least 20 minutes. This wasn't good seeing that one of our group did not get bacon on the burger. We tried to slow eat, this didn't work as it took so long to get the staffs attention. The waiter took the burger back and 10 mins later the manager came back WITH THE SAME BURGER, we were all done eating, \"there's bacon on it\" he stated. I said show me, he pointed to a baconless bun (i had all our group look and no bacon could be found).  \"We'll make you another\", no thanks the experience is now ruined and everyone was done eating and we aren't waiting around for 20 more minutes for a replacement burger? The burgers were very average, nothing that I would have shared on social media if this didn't happen.",

Everyone from the host at the door, to our server were very friendly and concerned that we were getting everything we needed. Clean, clean, clean! It was VERY busy during lunch time, but our wait was less that 15 minutes. We both got the classic double and added our own little twists (jalapenos/bacon). Our server was Lauren and was on point! Very pretty with a beautiful smile.  We came back the same afternoon, after the ferris wheel for milkshakes. We were lucky enough to get Lauren again. We ordered milkshakes and a rootbeer float. We also decided to splurge and split a 'Fluffanuttah' grilled sandwich (peanutbutter, bananas, nutella, fluff, grilled) YUM!  All of the prices are comparable to the strip. We were shocked at how great the meat was! The manager even came over to speak with us about our experience. Make it a point to stop in here. You won't be disappointed! Ask for Lauren.",

I ordered a chicken salad and my husband order the classic house burger. Even though our food was taking a very long time (they weren't very busy but the girls explained that they had only been open a short time and were trying their best). We didn't mind the wait because we were having so much fun with the girls. I eventually received my salad and our sides (which were not hot, though Amanda replaced them right away) but my husband still did not have his cheeseburger. The girls assured us it would be out right away. After 10 minutes and those poor girls getting yelled at by the people behind the counter, the cheeseburger arrived. When it arrived it was a complete mess and looked like it had been in a martini shaker and poured on a plate. The girls apologized profusely and kindly took 20 percent off of our meal for our trouble. The salad and cheeseburger were actually tasty, but the whole experience with the food made us not want to return unless it was for drinks only with the very friendly wait staff the restaurant seemed to have. We will be traveling the states this month and are hoping to try another Wahlburgers that is maybe more seasoned when it comes to the food.",

Quite honestly if Donny was there, I would've given it 5 stars given the same food. Good thing service here was okay. Then again, this place isn't that big to start off with. There's a gift shop at the beginning of this little plaza. At least if you buy a soda, you get to keep the Wahlburgers plastic green cup.   Kid's meals here are $7 and your choices are a small burger, mac and cheese, or chicken tenders and can come with fries or tater tots and some other choices. No, it doesn't come with a drink.   BTW, the coke products tastes a bit off here. So if you don't have to buy a soda, don't buy one. Afterall, you can just buy a ice cream float for $8 and that also comes with a green cup you can take home. If you ask nicely, you can just tell your server to get you a new one instead of rinsing your ice cream float cup.   Now when they come to LA, I don't need to visit. Thank goodness.",

Granted it's not much to look at but every single item ordered at our table was amazing!!! The staff wasn't overly friendly but I'd probably not be so nice serving food to drunk tourists in 106 degree weather. I love that a complimentary photo was taken and give as well as a keepsake plastic cup! If Donnie and Jenny decide on opening one here in Texas you can almost bet $ I'll be one of their very first customers cause I'm still craving that burger and onion rings!!! Also I really hope Donnie and Jenny are Yelpers so I can drop this hint and suggest San Antonio as your next site...please!",

The atmosphere was fun, the music was a tat loud for us but that's probably because we were hung over. Everyone looked as if they were enjoying themselves, and our waiter was extremely friendly and informative.   I decided on the Melt but requested the potato bun rather than the thick-cut bread. I also was intrigued by the mac and cheese when I noticed it included the word bacon, so I had to order that too. I also really wanted to try the sweet potato tots and luckily my friend decided to order those.   The burger was delicious. The crispy bacon, caramelized onions, and yummy house pickles made it perfect in my opinion. The mac and cheese was appetizing, not the best I've had, I wish it included a little more bacon, but overall it was good. But out of everything the thing that I loved the most is the ONE sweet potato tot my friend allowed me to try. It was this perfect consistency of crispy on the outside but soft and sweet on the inside. It was just perfect. Please whatever you do, make sure you try those! They're heavenly.",

That's the best part of my meal. For a side we got the onion rings which I didn't like very much they were cut up into tiny slices and didn't have much flavor or anything and because of the size and shape hard to dip into ranch, which I thought would add more flavor to them. So basically for 2 burgers, one side of fries and a side of onion rings our bill was just a few dollars from $40 (we had a water for our drink). Neither my boyfriend or I would go back and we don't recommend it to our friends. In the end it's a fast food regular burger with sit down prices.",

Secondly, although their burgers are good (not awesome) they are tiny compared to In n Out or Fatburger and nearly three times the price. Sorry, but the atmosphere of a dive burger place by Bally's is not worth the extra $. Green celebrity themed be damned. Not worth it.",

His burger, the \"our burger\" with double patties and bacon was pretty good but I could've experienced the same quality at FatBurger or some hole in the wall burger joint for half the price or less.  Also, was not impressed at the LACK of motif in the restaurant.  The service was fine, but the restaurant...nothing special.  There are a million \"gourmet\" burger places on the strip.

    "text": "Wahlburgers Las Vegas   Let me start by saying I'm a die hard Wahlberg fan. I grew up being a block head and I watch every Mark Wahlberg movie. Growing up, I may have stalked Donnie & Mark's family home in Braintree, Massachusetts when MTV was filming a show about them.  My husband & I visited Wahlburgers Las Vegas on July 4, 2016 around 3:45 pm. The location is ideal - in the new Bazaar shops near Bally's. It's a really cute location with small shops and Wahlburgers is tucked away in the back. When we found our way, the gentleman at the door said it would be about a 45 minute wait and asked my husband for his cell phone number. They text us when the table was ready which was cool cuz we could continue gambling or shop in that little area.  So, we get the text and show up about 2 minutes later and it was about 45 minutes we had to wait but when we got inside, there were a few tables open which was odd. The waiter comes over and we order waters. The ambiance is like the other location in Hingham, Ma so I've seen on TV. Lime green chairs and Wahlberg pictures on the walls and on the ceilings are the titles of movies Donnie & Mark have starred in. Cute! The waiter takes our order - we split the bacon Mac n cheese and I got the  Thanksgiving Day Sandwich and the hubs got Jenn's chicken sandwich. The waiter asked \"what would you like for a side\"? We both got the tater tots. We didn't have to wait that long, plus I was taking a bunch of pictures and taking it all in.  Initially, the bacon Mac n cheese didn't have the bacon or breadcrumbs on it but the waiter gave us a new cup - I assume he didn't just ask for bacon & breadcrumbs.  My sandwich was good. A turkey burger with stuffing and butternut squash puree with a little bit of mayo. A bit dry. I would have liked a cranberry jam on it or maybe more mayo, but it was good. Jenn's chicken sandwich was ok also but the bun was too small for the chicken breast and the Caramelized onions made the bun excessively soggy. Also, it had shredded lettuce which I thought would be better suited not being shredded.   The waiter came and asked if we had room for dessert. We didn't. We were full enough but not over full. The bill all together was $45.15. I was shocked that a lunch meal at a burger joint could be that expensive.  All in all, I would give Wahlburgers Las Vegas a score of 6.5 if we were saying 1 was bad and 10 was great. The things I liked were the way they text you telling you your table was ready. Very 2016 and a great idea instead of handing out those huge beepers. I also felt like my teenage self again being all boy band crazy. The main thing I did not like was the waiter asking what side we wanted as it implied the side came with the meal. Had we known roughly 15 tater tots each would be $4.95, we would have split one or not gotten them at all. They are straight up tater tots - no special seasoning on them or anything. My advice to this particular location is to either lower the prices or be sure the customer knows they have to pay for their side. Had we been a larger group like a family of 4, the bill would be close to $100. For a turkey burger and chicken sandwich?! In all fairness, they had only been open 4-5 days. But if they'd like to stay open 4-5 months, I recommend decreasing their prices. Still love Donnie & Mark but will never eat there again...certainly not the \"right stuff\" for those over inflated prices.",

    "text": "Since I live nearby I decided to go and see if another burger place could offer anything better than what's already a saturated market. Advertising of the business is probably done because of Mark.s being a popular actor.  Took about 8 minutes to walk there on a Saturday night. As my ticket reads 9:23PM. The bar had ample seating as did table's I ordered the Our Burger to go. Returned home and it was below my taste liking. I've eaten lots of burgers here in Las Vegas  and this place is one I won't be visiting again. For strip prices 10.95 would be fine If the small burger was a decent burger but it failed my test. I have worked a lot of conventions with food booths. I'm not sure if Wahlburgers  can break into the current competition with their products across the nation. My preference is Carl's jr not only because they had the first Angus beef burger but they haven't sacrificed size and still have a quality product. I looked at some orders being served while waiting and felt the fries and other items were small in size compared to Wendy's  McDonald's.in&out, Johnny Rockets, Jack In the box and other fast food  places. If you want to pay more for less its your Right to spend your money wherever and for whatever. We have different opinions and taste. This wasn't up to my satisfaction and I will not be recommending to my friends or others. I had really hoped that it would be something to give a four and possibly a five Star rating to but it fell way to short.",

The salad was awesome; iceberg lettuce, a slice of fresh tomato, \"government cheese\" (squares of those plastic wrapped slices of American, with the plastic removed of course!) and the house sauce, which tasted like Thousand Island dressing.  Simple but satisfying.  My mom loved her mac and cheese, made with penne, a rich white cheese sauce and plenty of bacon.  I took a taste and it was delicious; the pasta was a perfect al dente, the sauce creamy and unctuous, the bacon crispy and salty.  Nirvana.  The onion rings were a bit more like onion straws, which was fine with us.  The tempura coating was yummy and the onions didn't overwhelm at all.  Drink refills were prompt and plentiful.  The bill with tip was under $30.  It was a real steal considering most prices on the Strip. This place loses a star only because it was just too loud and crowded to really enjoy ourselves.   I'd go back in a New York, New York (or Paris) minute, though!  A girl and her Mom have gotta eat, after all!",

    "text": "During my latest trip to Vegas, I was pretty hungry come midnight and nothing sounded good. Everything else near Wahlburgers had either live music, something I didn't feel like eating, or douchebags surrounding the area, which led me to Wahlburgers.   The restaurant was about 25% full and we were seated and served right away. Our server was nice, didn't talk too much, but got us in and out of there in a timely fashion.   Our food came out and I was expecting the burger to be a little bigger. I was starving, so it tasted good to me, although there was nothing special about it. It needed some more flavor and it was sort of hard to eat since it was served in a small basket. I thought the burger would be better, but it got the job done.",

The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly. I felt like they use a high quality meat and the \"government cheese\" is definitely the only way to go on this burger. I genuinely felt it was a 5 star burger, the price on the other hand... I think it was $14-15 and yes it was a bit small for that price but it's on the strip in the heart of Las Vegas.   The tots were solid, 3.5-4 stars but not sure they were worth the $5.   My girlfriend got the mac and cheese with chicken. That was okay, somewhat small and what do you expect at a chain burger place (she doesn't eat red meat).   Overall I'd def return and look to go to a different location again in the future.",

    "text": "I would like to start off that I've watched the show and I've been asking my husband to take me here every time we go to Vegas.   When we arrived it definitely didn't meet our expectations like the show. We first parked and paid $15 for parking for 1.5 hours. We went to the restaurant and the host took our name and we waited 30 minutes to be seated. We weren't \"greeted\" it was more like a robot job, name and number and we'll text you once your table is ready. There was also a language barrier due to her not speaking the best english.   Once seated our order was taken and the server got my order wrong but I just was excited to try this amazing burger so didn't mention it. Now it surely didn't look like the burgers on the show. I was also excited to taste these buns since episodes go over how they got these special machine to make the perfect bun.   The buns were highly DISAPPOINTING! They were cold and completely smashed (view my pictures you'll see exactly why I say this).   The burger was just okay! I waited over an hour to be seated, paid for parking and to get my order wrong just for an okay burger.   I could have went to in n out and got the same thing within 10 minutes.   Would I recommend....I would say skip this burger joint and try something else. This isn't worth all the hype and definitely not worth the money.   My decent 3 star review is based off the burger. I would rate it lower due to service and location.   Oh and invest in some better chairs!!! This isn't prison.. The chairs are the worse part of the restaurant!! Each time someone moves the metal craps and makes a horrible noise.",

I think this place is . . . a lot of hype but not as much backing it up. The food was quality and staff was nice. I ordered the Thanksgiving burger and it was a good mash of flavors but by the time it got to the table it was nearly room temperature. Perhaps it's just the nature of stuffing and cranberry sauce, they cool quick. The lemonade was nice and tart, good stuff and we got to take home our green cups. Fries were mediocre as well.  A decent meal, but not quite what I was hoping for. (the hot dog I had around the corner at dirt dog was way more satisfying)",

    "text": "I stopped by here as a last place to eat at before I went back home from Vegas, and ordered ALOT of different food just to get a taste of their menu and critique it.   Double cheeseburger - I added avocado spread and grilled onions and the burger was decent. Didn't blow my mind away and is definitely not better than in-n-out or shake shack especially for $11-14. Would recommend to just try it once to get the curiosity outta the way, but wouldn't order it again.  Onion Rings - Thin, crispy, salty, light battering, on red onions. Was simple, flavorful, and delicious. Only comment was that it was too salty so would order again, but ask for less salt!!  Poutine Fries - REQUESTED for half tater tots and half fries. This dish was great as well! Was a bit on the saltier side, but worth ordering as a sharing plate with others. Only modification I would make is to get it with ALL TATER TOTS. Was much better with the tots instead of the fries. Also ask for less salt if you aint the salty type.  Chili & BEER - Were the wild cards. Was surprising how great the chili taste and the WAHLBURG BEER was delicious. Chili had a lot of beef and great flavor and the beer is in the lighter side and complimented the food so well! Definitely ordering the chili again and dump it on everything else you order to eat it with.  Mac n Cheese & Hot dog - are a both NOO! Mac n cheese lacks flavor and the pasta they use doesn't do it any justice. The polish dog is not that flavorful and definitely not worth it's price. HARD PASS!!   Overall I gave it a 4 when I think 3.5 is more accurate because service was wonderful. Got greater service here than at freaking Gordan Ramsay's HELL KITCHEN (unbelievable) and spent like 75% less at Wahlburgers. Worth giving it a shot, but not sure if I'd return.",

We arrived around 12:45 pm and were told that there was a 30 minute wait for a table, but we could get seated immediately at the bar. We chose that as we just wanted some burgers.  We each ordered a beer and stuck with the original Wahlburger; one with bacon, the other without. We also ordered a side of tater tots, and a side of the crispy onion rings (note that no sides are automatically provided; all a la carte).  The food arrived very quickly - we both ordered our burgers medium, but the inside was more medium/rare. We ate them, but wished that they had been cooked more thoroughly, which probably explains why the food arrived so quickly. In addition, the waitress served us a side of fries, which we had to correct her should be the onion rings. She whisked them away and immediately brought the rings.   The onion rings stole the show - best ever had! The tots were just...tots. Nothing exciting. The burger was juicy, but sloppily assembled.   After reading previous reviews, we were ready for a scary bill, but it was under $50 before a tip, so we were alright with that. We would eat at a Wahlburgers again, but wouldn't make it a top priority.",

The burgers were good, but not great.  The fries were definitely nothing special.  They have a wide variety of options on the menu.  The restaurant was clean and decorated kinda cute.  Service was okay.  We were able to get right in on a late Wednesday night.  It's a tourist trap.  Spend your money at In & Out or Five Guys; just as good for half the price.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here on a Thursday evening. We were a party of 6 and it took about 20-25 minutes before we were seated. They grabbed a phone number and said they'd call us when our table was ready, so we were able to roam the area and explore a bit in the meantime.  We got notified that our table was ready fairly quickly, and while it was fairly noisy inside, we still found it easy to converse with one another. I didn't get the chance to jot down what the rest of our party ordered for food and drinks, so this review will only cover the items I can remember.  If you're vegetarian, this is a good spot to check out! They've got good vegetarian options available, and they recently added the impossible burger. My friend and I ended up ordering the portobello sandwich and impossible burger, along with a ton of tater tots. Our food was splendid, and the tots were beyond incredible. Just typing this review up has me salvaging and missing the food there.  Our server checked up on us occasionally, but didn't really refill our water or anything like that unless we asked for it - something to note if you've got folxs who don't drink alcohol in your party.  The washroom/restroom is located outside and to the right of the restaurant, and that was kept relatively clean.   Overall, an affordable and good meal. Would definitely go back.",

However I was extremely disappointed and left unsatisfied. The service was great, our server was awesome she wasn't the problem. The food on the other hand was very bland and mediocre, I just expected more from these guys. Me and my friend had the regular burgers and I wasn't a fan of how each extra topping costed more money. I had the fries and he had the sweet potato tots. Both weren't very good. Honestly I'd prefer McDonald's fries over Wahlburgers and the tots were cold and hard. The burgers weren't anything special and had little flavor. The strawberry and chocolate shake I had was super good and that was the only thing i enjoyed here. The cocktails were extremely overpriced, I've payed less for liquor in some of the casinos. Overall I just went for the experience and left disappointed. 40 bucks for 2 burgers and a shake is a little ridiculous. Mark! You gotta do better man!!!!",

If you typically enjoy more than a medium fry at McDonald's then order your own. I wouldn't saw they are steak fries but they are on the thicker side.  Food came out hot and fresh.

It was a bit off on flavor and doesn't live up to the hype.  This was before fries, which we did order and had to send back because they were cold and we asked for fresh ones.  With a drink everything came out to around $35.  So I figured out this is a tourist trap, where you go for nostalgia of going there, but get charged up the wazoo for the experience.",

    "text": "Was pretty disappointed with our first experience here. We got the fried pickles for an appetizer and for $8 we literally got 6 or 7 tiny pieces. But they were very delicious! My husband and I each ordered a burger and while they came out pretty quick (it was about 1am) mine had a very large hair in it so I sent it back. I'm a really chill person and I realize this can happen so it wasn't a huge deal to me but what disappointed me most was to listen to the workers behind the counter stand their and argue about whose hair it was. It was clearly a beard hair and there were several guys behind the counter with beards. I was given a new burger but no manager came out to speak to us and nothing was comped on our bill. I was at least hoping the appetizer would be taken off. Oh well. For the price I would rather go to in & out.",

    "text": "Great potential but turned out to be a disappointment. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded yet it took almost 30 minutes to get our food. When we finally got our food it was all cold with the exception of a side of mac and cheese. How long was it sitting in the kitchen that all 5 of us got cold food. The crispy onion rings/strings were cold and limp and not crispy. If they were hot or even warm they probably would've been very tasty. The double cheeseburger had great flavor but was cold also. Then I bit into a jalapeno when I didn't order them on my burger. Everyone at our table was disappointed. I guess we should have made a stink about it or told a manager but we were so hungry we just wanted to eat our food and go, and didn't want to wait even longer for hot food. If the food was hot it would be a 3 or 3.5 review. Sorry Marky Mark, Whalburgers is a 1 star experience. It's just an overpriced celebrity themed Vegas tourist restaurant and I fell for trap.",

I'm not a picky eater and really wanted to like the food but it just wasn't good.  Went on a weekday so it wasn't too packed and got seated right away. Our server came over and he just didn't seem too happy to be there.  We ordered a couple of their specialty burgers and half fries/half tots.  The food took a bit long to get to our table but we were okay with that because we figured it would be cooked to perfection.... wrong.  When we finally got our food, it was COLD.  The kitchen had a window so you could kind of see the cooks cooking and putting the food in the window so I have no idea how it went from the window to our table cold?!  I'm confused.  Giving a 2 star cause the location was nice and I like the tv show.  Good luck guys.",

You are seated and have a waiter but people can come in and order form the register up front. Our server kept forgetting about us and it took forever to get anything (probably about an hour). You can turn any of the burgers or sandwiches into a salad so I did that with their chicken salad. Instead of salad dressing they put the weird mayo all over the salad. That's pretty vile. The mac and cheese was weirdly runny and there werent any cool dipping sauces for the fries or tator tots. I'll hard pass on this place next time.",

My daughter liked her Mac and Cheese, but you really have to be incompetent to bung that one up.  So expensive, tasteless food? \"Eek! Methinks\" is a well-earned rating.

Cooked the way I asked for it and without a ton of grease.   I just got their basic burger on a gluten free bun. The bun was a little big for just one burger, but it still was delicious. Good quality meat, and I really enjoyed that after I ate their burger I didn't feel like I ate a pile of grease. The tots were fine - they weren't anything exciting, but that's OK.   By husband got the OFD burger and enjoyed it. It may had bacon and lots of toppings, but he really liked it and would definitely get it again.   We got their grilled cheese sandwich for our son and it was a perfect size with plenty of cheese - he was definitely pleased with all the cheese!  It was good. I will definitely go back again and try one of their signature burgers instead of just their basic burger. They also have gluten free buns, bread and croutons, so I think a patty melt is in order! And they have the classic MA lobster roll buns browned on the flat top with some butter on it, so if you want a hot dog, I'm sure it is great!",

I can get a much better burger and fries at In N Out for just 12 bucks for both of us.   This is a fad restaurant that simply won't last given the myriad of choices available.  This is a prime example of leveraging a name to take advantage of consumers.",

    "text": "Very disappointing experience.  I love the show and have been super excited for the brothers and their success of taking Wahlburgers worldwide but sometimes you have to make sure you don't stretch yourself thin.  We were there to celebrate our friends wedding and chose Wahlburgers as the place to eat the night before.  We were crammed into a table against the wall and everyone was a bit uncomfortable.  The server was nice but I do not believe he got a single order correct.  Burgers weren't cooked correctly, some people got things on their burger they didn't order and some items were simply left off.  My biggest pet peeve was they \"sold\" the meals when they brought them to the table.  They yelled \"who had the _____\" which left us looking at each other because several of us ordered the same thing.  If it's done properly the server should ring the order in by seat and the food runner should put the food on the tray in the order of the seats therefore eliminating confusion.  My other issue was the price... holy lord.  $13 for JUST THE BURGER??? I had to check to see if I was eating at a Michelin Star Chef's restaurant with that price!  Sides were extra.  We ordered a side of onion rings and they came out ice cold.  I asked for a new order and the server seemed very annoyed that cold onion rings were served.  Since we were there to celebrate the whole mood was brought down with lackluster service and sub par food.  There are thousands of places to eat in Vegas and I'm sure our next visit we will avoid this place.",

Honestly one of the best Thanksgiving sandwiches beside the Bobbi from Caps. Also had onion rings so thin and so good. Also had the Caesar Salad that fell short I wasn't a fan of the dressing or the ranch. They add balsamic or vinegar to it, it was kinda weird for me. But overall I will be back. We are locals so I get to come back anytime which rocks! Also Lucy was our server. She was amazing, so nice knowledgeable and patient! Great service.",

We had to wait only a few minutes, since we're early dinners.  We went at 6pm on a Wednesday night.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  It is, by the way, a burger joint, so I ordered the \"BBQ Bacon\" burger and my wife ordered \"The Our Burger\".  We both thought they were really tasty.  if you call yourself a burger joint, the burgers should be good, and they were.  The waiter recommended the sweet potato tots.  We really enjoyed those.  They are sweet and have a pretty interesting texture.  The best I could describe them would be hash brown balls, but sweet.  I couldn't stop eating them.  The only complaint I have is the cost.  However, I've been complaining about the cost of food in Vegas since we got here.  It's ridiculous.",

And if they ask if you would like fries or tots you find out on the bill that it cost an extra $5 per side (that  is for 8 tater tots). My son and daughter both had chicken tenders they were dry and the waiter offered nothing but ketchup to put on them it also tasted like the fryer grease has not been cleaned since they opened. It leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth. We ordered drinks too and had them gone immediately but we were never offered any refills. The menu said they had a burger of the day but when I inquired about it the waiter said the restaurant didn't do specials and was rather snippy about it.  This place had a fast food feel and taste but a price tag of something much more. If your in the mood for a burger in Vegas avoid this place and your sure to find something better just down the road.",

So we checked in and there was already a line about 5 people in front of us. Was offered a bar seat because there were some seats open, but we decided to wait instead. The only good thing about their wait system is you can leave your number and they text you when you have your table ready. So meanwhile, we went around the little shops around (there's a lush nearby btw for all my ladies lol)   Service was okay. Everything was served pretty fast.  Food was average. You really can't come in here comparing it to in n out or shake shack. You'll be setting yourself up for disappointment. Price point is a bit high comparing to the said places above. Tater tots were anemic and not seasoned.   Will we be back? Probably not, it's a nice novelty place to try once especially if you're a fan. But there's so many more places that are better around Vegas.",

We also ordered onion rings and fries.  Unfortunately, it did not exceed our expectations. Flavors just fell short and bland. One reviewer said which I agree..the fries had no seasoning...just basic. And the onion rings were not your typical onion rings; they were more like onion strings. If I had a choice of a burger joint, this wouldn't be my first...sorry Wahlburgers :(",

Add the servers running back and forth and the place felt chaotic.  The service was very good, the burger was over cooked but still good. The bun was kind of smashed in so handling the thing was a challenge. We wandered around to find a fork and knife.   The Thanksgiving burger was good but small. The initial food came surprisingly fast but the desert grilled fluffanutta took 20 minutes to show up. It was good though.  In other words the food and the server was good and the rest of the experience was not so good.",

The burger is small, the bun is prett much a basic grocery store hamburger buns, the burger itself had good flavor but appeared and tasted to be topped with STOVETOP STUFFING!!! I mean for the price at least make a nice homemade stuffing. Anyway ended up having to get a second meal elsewhere to make up for this lackluster dud of a burger. There are tons of burger options on the Vegas Strip....pass this one",

We missed the opening of Coney Island by one week. So there was no way we were missing it in Las Vegas. I am happy to say it was well worth the wait! We had a short wait for a table, the hostess advised 20 minutes, when lucky for us it was actually probably only about 10 minutes. Fast with the drink and food orders. Our waiter was able to give some good recommendations, that did not disappoint. A girl will come around to take a souvenir picture, which i found a bit weird, but hey it's Las Vegas so we went with it. The tables are a bit close  on the patio and it can be a bit difficult to sit without bumping into someone as you are leaving.   We get our food and let me just tell you, the patty melt is AMAZING!! Best one I have ever had. The beef was excellent. Government cheese, I am a fan. :) Way to go Elma and Paul!  I ordered the onion rings, not realizing how big the portion was. Very tasty! My husband knew he wanted the sloppy joe with tater tots and cheese since he had seen this on the tv show years ago and had his mind set on it. Once again they did not disappoint. The serving of the tater tots was just like my onion rings, way too much food. We will know for next time! Which there will be a next time.",

I hadn't been back to Vegas since January 2013, so the whole Grand Bazaar area was completely new to me.  Detroit actually *just* got a Wahlburgers recently, but we were in line for Burgr (Gordon Ramsay restaurant at Planet Hollywood) and were quoted an hour, so we decided to check this out - I went with a Yelper who now lives in Vegas, and his girlfriend.  There are really only 3 burger choices which surprised me ... okay, maybe 4 - the plain burger, the regular burger (essentially the plain burger but with cheese), the double burger, and the triple. I got the plain burger and added tomatoes and pickles, plus mushrooms ($1 upcharge). We ordered the onion strings (yes, strings) and the sweet potato tots too to split.  My burger was overall fine, nothing special but that Wahlburgers sauce is really good. Almost reminded me of In-N-Out's sauce, actually. The onion strings were good but the sweet potato tots were fantastic, so I'd get those next time. The burger will cost you about $9.99-$10.99 and sides are $4.99.   Hoping to check out the Detroit Wahlburgers now! It's a bit pricey for what you get but overall the food is delicious.",

    "text": "Ummm no. Just no. The Wahlberg brothers need to rethink this business investment. Let me preface this by saying that I didnt look at any reviews before deciding to eat here although I did notice the 3 star average when I checked in. I always form my own opinion after checking the place out regardless of Yelp ratings.  Located in the Grand Bazaar shops outside of Bally's Hotel Casino, the place looked packed when we came in on a saturday night around 8 pm. We were told that our party of four was a 15 to 30 minute wait. I gave the hostess my cell number so that she could text or call me when a table opened up. We walked around looking at some of the stores. Got a text 10 mins later so off we went.  Was sat down in a booth pretty much right in front of the counter where all the food was placed when done cooking. I got the Bbq Bacon Burger, my son got the Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, and my friend got the Double Decker. We decided to get Tots, Sweet Potato Tots, and Thin Crispy Onion Rings to share.  The Bbq Bacon Burger ($12.95), has a 1/3 pound beef patty, white cheddar, bacon, fresh jalapenos, house made bbq sauce and avocado spread. The waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked so I said medium rare. Burger was decent and was actually cooked how I wanted it. Didnt really wow me at any given point. Hardly any jalapenos and the bbq sauce was just ok.   My son opted to have the Jenn's Chicken Sandwich ($11.95) as a salad for you have the option of making any sandwich or burger a salad with no price difference. The grilled chicken was cut up into small chunks, was tossed with mixed greens, carmelized onions, crisp onions, and house made honey garlic mayo. My son was not wowed either by the salad. I took a couple of bites and I agreed with him. It was no better than a basic caesar salad with grilled chicken.  The Double Decker (12.95) has two 3 ounce beef patties, lettuce, tomato, onion, \"government cheese\", Paul's signature Wahl sauce, and housemade pickles. It was basically a slider with two beef patties. My  friend finished it quick for it wasnt really all that big to begin with. She said that it tasted kind of like a White Castle burger. Thats not a compliment by the way.  The Yukon Gold Fries, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, and Thin Crispy Onion Rings ($4.95 each) were all very disappointing. All were lukewarm. Tots and fries were almost to the point of being soggy. Needless to say we only only ate about a quarter of the all 3 sides before realizing that it just wasnt all that appetizing. Just remember nothing on the menu comes as a combo meaning you dont  get a side and a drink with your burger. That blows. It only means that you are spending even more for a la carte items.  Service was just ok. Took awhile before our server would come around to ask if we needed anything. Not sure if he was pre occupied with so many other tables but I noticed plenty of servers walking around everywhere.  In closing, I dont think the 65 bucks I spent for mediocre burgers and lukewarm bland sides was worth it. Oh, did I mention that the soda I got was $3.95? How is a soda almost as much as an appetizer? The one thing that really bothered me was that I noticed that they already have the sides cooked ahead of time and are placed under heat lamps. This was in plain sight from where we sat. No wonder they were lukewarm and almost to the point of being soggy. I usually take home any leftover items so as not to waste any food but this rare occasion, we didnt want to take any of the sides home. Lastly, Bally's is in the process of putting up parking meters in their parking structure. Yay, more expenses before you even step foot out your car. Im putting this place in my \"One and Done\" portfolio. Not coming back and I dont recommend you even trying it for yourself. Go somewhere else that is worthy of their burgers and sides.

We split a double patty burger and had sweet potato tots (that were recommended). The burger was good but it was more because I hadn't eaten in ten hours more than anything. The loss of stars is because of the tots..I love sweet potato anything...except these. They were small, doughy tasting that were more like nuggets than tots. I could only eat five before just giving up...not the highlight of my trip to say the least. Staff was very pleasant and welcoming but food didn't hold up to reputation.",

Since it tastes fast foodie, they should make it fast foodie...order at the counter, get a number, etc. There really is no need for waiters and waitresses here. But we had good service, maybe because the place was mostly empty. I got the \"Our Burger\" and Doug got \"The Melt\" and we shared Thin Crispy Onion Rings and a Chocolate Frappe. We ordered our burgers done Medium but I think they were closer to Medium Rare but we ate them because we were hungry.They were just very plain tasting and our Onion Rings and frappe were just okay. I can't believe we paid restaurant prices (11-13$) for fast food type burgers. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend this place, so many better places on The Strip to get a good burger, don't waste your time here!",

We were there on 3/25 around 4:30ish, and we were seated, and then completely ignored. After 5-7 minutes a server asked if we had been waited on, and once we said no, he took our drink order and walked away. A different person then brought out drinks and took our food order. While we were seated at our booth, a group of servers were congregating right behind our booth and talking. I found it distracting, especially when they were stacking (and dropping) menus behind my husband's head. Food was good, but their service was terrible. I am just visiting, so it's not like I'll be going back, but if you happen to be in the area, don't bother coming here.",

My sister and I arrived around 4:40pm on a Monday and it wasn't crowded at all to our surprise, although it did later. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and was seated in a booth shortly after.   The waiter came within 3 min and took our drink and food order. We both order alcoholic beverages which were good (can't remember the name since it was a special drink for that day) and we both ordered the 1/3 burger with French fries and the star of my day the chili. The chili omg was so good. It had the right amount of spices and beans.   Overall, our experience was good. The burgers were tasty and cooked to our preference, the fries were hot and fresh, the chili  and the drinks were all good. I definitely recommend stopping by if your looking for a burger place.",

    "text": "So we have seen Wahlburgers the show, and I follow Mark on his Instagram, which he personally promotes all of the new establishments that he and his family open.  As we enjoyed our time in Vegas low and behold we see on it the Wahlburger joints right of the strip. As this was my sons birthday trip we asked him as a burger lover if he would like to try this place out, his eye kit up and was eager to get his hands on a Wahlburger.   We make our way up and are greeted by a personable host who guides us to our table. So far so good, we enjoy the ambiance having two kids with us it was not terribly overly loud.   Our server introduces herself, but there is a vibe which was not as inviting from this particular server. Non the less she takes our order, which were three Our Burgers. All three had the \"government cheese\" and some special requests. Unfortunately the special request part was not conveyed by the server to the kitchen staff so the orders were not necessarily correct, not biggy, the person who'd brought the food \"not the server\" took back one of the orders for a correction. It was simply no pickles on one, mine was missing the wahlsauce, which i was looking forward to try. I didn't ask for mine to be corrected, and went for it. The buns were soft and perfectly warm, the cold stuff ( lettuce, tomatoes) were fresh and crisp, and the burger itself was cooked to order, mine medium. It was one of the best burgers I've had! My son had his order adjusted ( minus pickles) and he cannot stop raving about it being the best burger he's ever had. Very nice!! My wife thoroughly enjoyed her burger, and said the pickles were perfect.   Overall this place is worth it and if I had a local Wahlburger in Murrieta/Temecula it would be our to go place.  Now for the missing star, this is for the waitress, with zero personality, and treated the night like just another job. I get that we all work, I'm a business owner and understand that the key to repeat business is your staff, the team that represents your brand. I would seriously make sure that whoever overseas this region should talk to their employees and understand a bit more what would make their days/nights shifts better in order to ensure the customers are satisfied all around.   I'll give it up to the Wahlburgs and say they have hit the nail on the head and to keep on pushing the brand. Just be sure the overall experience is one that would make your customer come back to continue and enjoy your burgers.",

    "text": "This is a tough review to write.  I feel so conflicted by Wahlburgers.  First off, I keep seeing reviews about the prices.  Given the location; the prices are quite reasonable.  You can go to almost any fast food place on that block and pay just as much, sometimes more.  So with that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the prices.  Some of my findings: Fiesta burger - absolutely amazing Tater tots - good Wahl sauce - outstanding  Sweet potato tots - soggy  While I found most of the food to be really good, the service was a bit shaky.  I ordered a milk shake with my meal, but it didn't come.  Another issue we had was that my mother, who's a vegetarian; ordered a salad sans meat.  We explained that she's a vegetarian and need her salad minus the meat, but it came with meat.  They then had to remake it and we sat for about 20 minutes before the food arrived. I was in the rest room (out the door and around the corner) when the food came, so I missed the waiter.  When he came back again our meal was almost finished and I had to remind him about the milkshake.  He was very sincere and apologetic, but I still waited probably 40 minutes for a milkshake.   That being said; these things can be chalked up to human error. Accidents happen, and while it was two; I wasn't too mad about it.  One thing I did find to be a bit out of line was the photographers.  At one point while we were waiting for our food someone came up and offered us to take a picture for a complimentary postcard.  We agreed, who would say no?  Later on, while I had my face stuffed with food, a woman came by and hovered over me with a book of pictures asking for money.  I felt that that was just intrusive and a bit tacky.  I eventually just had to shake my head no, because she didn't give me a chance to swallow my burger before she walked away seeming agitated.  I would definitely recommend that this practice be re-evaluated by management, as it just kind of came off rude.    All in all, I liked Wahlburger's.  The food was good enough and I work nearby.  I would consider going back, and with a smoother experience I could see myself giving this place a 4 or 5 star rating.",

It's listed as a seasoned turkey patty with stuffing, cranberry sauce and roasted peppers... well, it didn't come that way (thrown together, sad looking patty, no cranberry sauce and no roasted peppers.) I Sent it back and asked for it exactly as listed on the menu. Second burger was an absolute disaster. It's as if the chef was pissed off or somebody back there hated their job. There was mayo and cranberry sauce slathered everywhere on the burger. You literally couldn't pick it up without it dripping all over the place. Two bites and I was over it. For what they're charging it's really a shame, I had expected it to be better with the Wahlburg name attached to it. Will not be returning.",

They have a full bar and their own beers from Vegas here are pretty good. I loved the service. Our waiter was Ashley and she was a doll. Definitely a must!",

Ended up being there for over 2 hours when just ordering a grilled cheese and a burger. The grilled cheese wasn't even grilled or melted at all!! Just two slices of cold cheese on a cold bun. Plus French fries instead of the tater tots we ordered. Couldn't believe it. Then when telling the server, she rolled her eyes and just said \"ok\". No \"sorry about that\" or anything. Took another 20 minutes for her grilled cheese to come back and didn't even come back with tater tots. What an awful experience and complete waste of our day in Vegas.   Food once finally received = D+",

By the time I received my new one, we were done eating and I had to ask three times to get it. Total bill was $71.00!

Went in around 1230am & it wasn't too busy. The wait to sit down was around 15-30 mins so we opted for the takeout order and sat outside at Starbucks.   We ordered the:  Our burger- it was nothing spectacular, it was a basic cheeseburger with LTO, pickles & their special wahl sauce. We've had better burgers for a cheaper price ( In-N-Out or Red Robin). It honestly lacked in the flavor part. I did like that they use FRESH lettuce and it was shredded. I hate when I get burgers with wilted/warm lettuce and the freshness of it made a difference.   French Fries- regular fries, there was a light seasoning on it and I wish they had a little more on it because it probably would've gave the fries more flavor and taste more than just a regular frozen fries from a bag.  Onion Rings- thin strings of battered onions fried and seasoned. It was a very generous portion but nothing phenomenal about it. It was kind of soft and which I think of onion rings, I don't imagine it being soft. Read all these reviews of it being the best ever and it didn't live up to the hype. I wish it came with a sauce of some sort to dip it in, it probably would make a difference.   Overall, it was an alright experience but I do think it was overpriced for what we got. I had such high hopes for this place because I love their tv show & always heard good things of this place.  Maybe we came on a bad night??  I might consider coming here again and seeing if there's a difference in the future.",

We were greeted by a lovely host and sat immediately, coincidentally in the exact same booth as the day before. I think his name was Peter? Nice guy, came over immediately and brought us all waters before we had the chance to order our drinks.  Our waiter, William (Bill), was AWESOME!!! Didn't skip a beat, he was totally \"on it\" the entire time being helpful, quick, attentive and funny. Great server.   All 4 of us ordered \"THE MELT\", which was sooo good. Everything, including the Yukon gold fries came out quick and best of all, nice and steamin' hot! The chili w/ cheese, is by far my favorite item on the menu. It comes out so hot (not spicy hot, I'm talkin' temperature) and it's just the best. It Literally stays hot the whole meal, so if you take a while to eat and your fries lose their warmth, dip those babies in the chili and it's like they just came out of the fryer. Lol. Love This place & can't wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

I understand places get busy but we were two people out of six sitting at the bar. We waited for 10 minutes to even get acknowledged, and were told we have 1 person ahead of us that they will be with us soon. Then another 10 minutes went by and finally someone came over to talk to us and take drink orders. We told them how long we had been waiting and the man helping us apologized, but then in the background the first man that told us we were next said it's only been 10 minutes. I find it ridiculous one to be waiting for that long to even be acknowledged but to be talked to like that when we said nothing except we had been waiting for way too long was rude and uncalled for. We ended up just getting up and leaving. So my suggestion if you want to go there is sit at a table do not go to bar and sit hoping to get any sort of great service. I was really hoping for that great lunch and unfortunately got a bad experience.",

My hubby and I both ordered the original burger. What sold me was the description of \"government cheese\". Seriously this brings back memories of being poor and eating that  hunk of cheese like it was gourmet. So the burger comes and it's nothing fancy, but the patty looks like something your mama made with her hands with the 70% meat 30% fat that she got from the butcher.  It was so damn good. Nothing fancy nothing special but just a damn good burger. So if you are coming here looking for some gourmet stuff don't even bother. If you're coming here looking for an OG burger then this is your spot.",

    "text": "Service: 5 stars. Food: 2 stars.   First off, these are the most attentive bartenders I have ever seen. They are on top of everyone's drinks and ensure the bar is clean, something I always look at behind a bar.   I ordered the BBQ Bacon and it was pretty good, but the jalapeno's were raw, which was strange. Grilled jalapenos would have provided a much better flavor. The bread was good and the meat cooked perfectly.  The onion rings were so bland. Even after adding a lot of salt, they were so bland and definitely not worth the additional $5. The bartender noticed that I did not even touch them...I thought he was going to take it off the ticket, but he didn't.  The Cucumber Lemonade was perfect. Very flavorful, but I don't know if it was worth $13. If it cost $8-9, I probably would have ordered another one. The Sam Adams was a tad on the flat side.  This place is WAY too expensive for what you get, especially considering how it is hidden from the strip. With a strip view, I could totally see paying these high prices, but not in this small, tucked in a corner location. For a burger, onion rings, 2 drinks, and tip it cost me $44. Unless the prices are reduced, I think I will go to Shake Shack the next time I feel like a burger.",

Prices are steep for what you get; beer is ridiculously pricey relative to what they offer. Just keep walking past this place... don't bother.",

To sum up the experience, I ordered the BBQ \"Bacon\" burger, which came to the table without bacon. The burger was like warm at best. We ordered the Mac N Cheese. It was watery and lacked flavor. The fries were warm as well as the tater tots. I gave it a two star rating instead of a one because the overall the burgers were great tasting, if only brought to the table with a little more temperature. We came in the middle of lunch where one would think the food, including the fried food, would be cooked to order. It didn't seem like like in this case. Maybe Paul needs to do a quality control visit and get the cooks and servers in line.",

Shortly after being seated our waiter came over to us and greeted us and took our drink order. I had a spiked strawberry lemonade and it was good. You could actually taste the alcohol in it. Anywho on to the burgers. My boyfriend got Paul's favorite ,I got Donnie's favorite both done medium, and we shared sweet potato tater tots. The burgers were so yummy. The meat is seasoned so well and the buns are nice, fresh, and soft. Paul's favorite is a delicious classic American burger, while Donnie's has bacon, bbq sauce, and avocado spread which pairs nicely with the meat and bacon. Only complaint from me and the reason for giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bacon on my burger was cold and the tater tots were not crunchy. Besides those 2 small minimal details staff was friendly and attentive, food was great, oh and the whal sauce is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!

When it came out it had dressing on the salad and what looked like Mustard. We sent it back with a different person. Not more than 30 seconds went by when Amber came by and ash Paige where her salad was. We told her what happened and she told us the other table had the same thing happen. Amber took off to the kitchen. She returned not more than 5 minutes with what what Paige wanted. She said \"So sorry about that,  we're taking it off the bill, enjoy\" and walked away. We didn't complain, get upset or mad, didn't even ask for compensation. When we left, we left her the price of the salad plus her tip! Let's just say it was over $20. The service has always been great there. It's just nobody ever is willing to take time to write about it. Yet, the 1st ones to let everyone know when something is wrong at anyplace. My reason for writing this is, good people need to be recognized too, not just the bad! If you ever make it here. Ask for Amber! She one in a Million! Now I gotta tell Marky Mark and his Family!",

He wanted me to get the experience he had when he came in. We showed up on a Thursday evening after he picked me up from the airport. He was already in town. I was starving after spending a whole day waiting out some layover time at the SFO airport so the first thing I wanted to do was eat. He knew just where to take me. We were able to walk right in and get seated right away. The service was excellent. I wish I would have grabbed a name because our server went above, and beyond to make sure I got to try all of the wonderful sauces. Our drinks were always full, and our food was out really fast. I think the burger we had was called the melt? I am not positive. But it was very good. It was on toasted  bread. I enjoyed dipping it in one of the sauces that was kind of sweet/ spicy. The tots, and fries are very delicious as well. If we had one of these in my town I would be a regular. Next time I am in the area I am going to have to stop in.   **I saw someone write about their burger not being all the way cooked, we were asked how we liked ours cooked. I am pretty sure you can tell them how you like your burgers if you don't like it pink inside.",

Burger was good and the side order of half fries/half onion rings were a lot. Probably could have split it. My co-worker however, got the \"our burger\", medium. The burger came rare. Looked like the beef version of ahi tuna. Couldn't even get through half the burger. He also got half fries and half tater tots which were ok. Sauces are a \"meh\".   Price: over priced. My one soda, was $4.95. Maybe it's because it came in a souvenir cup (which we had no idea about until the check came).   I don't think I'd eat here again. And I don't recommend it.",

It was flavorful  and the toppings were fresh and tasty. I also had a side of onion rings and they were more than one person could eat.  One of my companions ordered the macaroni and cheese and it made me wish I had ordered some for myself, despite the fact that I'm pretty picky about mac and cheese. This was definitely a winner. My companion also have the sloppy joe and said it was very good.  Service was great, albeit a little slow. I track that up to the fact that all of the food was fresh and well prepared.

We were there around 8pm and we were able to get two seats at the bar immediately. The wait list for a table was about 40 minutes.  He LOVED the burger and has not stopped talking about it. We both had The Our Burger. Mine as is and his with bacon and no cheese. We were struggling with whether to do 2 orders of the thin crispy onion rings. The waitress suggested one order would be enough for two. When we got the order we surmised she must have been talking about two armies. It was HUGE! And goooood! Their Wahlbrewski rounded it out for me. The tab was minimal. The food, service and atmosphere FANTASTIC!",

The employees were all really accommodating and nice, they'd help you with any questions you had or any requests. Since majority of things are made from scratch right there they can make adjustments to the meals for whatever you need. I got the impossible burger and they helped me make it vegan! The burger was really good but it was so expensive at $19 and you don't get any fries or drink with that either. The regular burgers are $13 and are the same with not getting any fries or drink. My mom had the chili and said it was good and we had their fries and onion rings which were also good! The way the place works is kind of different and I'm not sure I really liked it. It was like a restaurant where you get served but they bring out all the food in baskets and plastic cups like a fast food place. It was also kind of noisy and kind of hard to get to (but that may be because we're not locals and don't know our way around Vegas that well. Admittedly, we're not the typical tourist either and have come to Vegas many times so we do know it somewhat decently). If you're willing to spend the money I think it's a good restaurant especially for a late night bite since they're open until 2am. We left at 1:30am and people were just being seated so you can probably stay even a little past 2am.",

Being quite honest, my prime fascination for this place is because of Mark Wahlberg and also because there isn't a Wahlburgers in Texas yet. They had a good selection of drinks and a variety of burgers. I chose a regular beef patty burger and the patty was pretty thick and juicy. I would definitely visit this place again, especially if Wahlburgers comes to Texas.",

The Burger was nothing to brag about & the fries/tater tots aren't anything special. From the bag to the fryer. Also when we asked \"what's the special sauce?..\" and the waitress starts saying -\"ketchup , Mayo...\" that's NO secret. That's thousand Island dressing base...McDonalds and the rest of America has been using that for decades!  Give me my Five Guys, BurgerFI, Shake Shack, etc, anyday!",

Plenty of beer and alcohol on tap/available for any pallet. Food is always deliscious, and they have GLUTEN FREE bun options, Yes! I have been to this location and the one at Myrtle beach, and neither has made me sick in anyway, and I am very sensitive. Just ensure you do the usual emphasis to your server about it needing to be g-free.

I asked for medium rare and it came out perfect all the way to edges. We tried the fries and onion rings. Go for the onion rings. Fries were pretty standard but those onion rings I'll crave now. I also tried their beer and it was super drinkable. Ordered another one for walking the strip. Overall, I highly recommend and can't wait for one in Chicago!",

The burgers are high quality. The ingredients are fresh and overall delicious.   They have regular tater tots and sweet potatoes tots. Both are excellent  My wife ordered a salad with grilled chicken she gave me the thumbs up (she's hard to please) so this is a good sign.  I would recommend Wahlburgers to anyone wanting an above average burger experience.   Did I mention they have a full bar?",

The place is always slammed and just know there will be a wait.   The staff hustles and the place is full of energy.  There were 5 of us and we all enjoyed the food.  My burger was properly cooked, well presented and tasty.  My tots were amazeballs!   Crispy, hot, well seasoned and delicious.  Satisfying meal overall.   The place is very busy but did not feel crowded like some celebrity spots in Vegas.  Also know that you are going to pay $13 for an $8 burger.  It is a Wahlburgers so there is cost for it being a celebrity food spot.  I was not offended by the cost but it was in the higher end of what you want to spend.   If I want a burger, there are other places I would go from a value perspective.   If I have friends in town that want a burger on the strip his would be an option.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Mark and Donnie Wahlberg so of course I had to come here on my trip to Vegas!  There was a 15-30 minute wait when we got to the restaurant at noon on a Monday; we ended up only having to wait 15 minutes.  They took our phone number to text us when our table was ready so we got to walk around a bit while waiting which was nice.    I ended up ordering the Our Burger and added bacon to it.  I'm assuming what's supposed to make their burgers are their sauce and pickles, which honestly I didn't care for.  Once I got to a part of my burger that didn't have any sauce or pickles, I enjoyed my burger more.  Sides are extra - I ended up getting their fries which were just okay.    The restaurant concept has kind of a weird feel.  It's a sit-down restaurant yet has fast-food touches, such as napkin dispensers on tables and water served in fast food soft drink containers.  There was a woman who came by who offered to take pictures of us \"for their website\" - we declined.  People around us though took her up on her offer and ended up with pics in souvenir frames that actually looked kind of cool.  There were pics of the Wahlbergs on the walls but we were by windows so I didn't get to take silly pics posing with them :p (Diners were sitting too close to the wall for me to get pics.)  My Wahlberg-loving self is glad I finally got to try Wahlburgers.  I've had better burgers though.  Still, it was a-ok and worth a trip just to say I tried it :)",

We arrived around lunch time and wanted our food to-go. The line took FOREVER to move with one girl behind the register. The food was pricy, but I mean, it's Vegas, that is expected. I ordered The Melt, salad version, no bread for me! It was SOO good. Kudos on the food Wahlbergs!   The cashier, girls prepping food and manager were all so sweet, but we waited almost 20 minutes to get our food. It honestly was not THAAAT crowded, they kept mixing up the to-go orders with the sitdown orders. It seemed like the servers in the sit down area were annoyed with the crowd waiting in the to-go section,there was no where to wait really so we were in their way.  As far a cleanliness, they could sure step it up. There was trash on the floor and the condiments section was a mess. The servers would leave their cups and water bottles around where guests can see - I know it was the servers because I saw them put them down and take them once they headed to the back. If it was trash, they should have just tossed it.",

It was very good and a large portion. I wished we'd split it. When we asked for a fork the server brought one and laid it on the table in passing- really dropped it. Rude! I expect more from a tourist town. He did not seem as if he really wanted to serve us. Also beware the sodas are almost $5.",

The quality of the food is decent; the quantity of food delivered degenerates the value.  The total experience keeps you from returning.  Wahlburgers, sadly, must depend exclusively on uninformed tourists.

(i'm originally from massachusetts and i like everything about the wahlburgs'...at least, as much as an average person like myself should know based on mark and donny's acting in movies etc. im not a rabid fan, but theyve done some good work)  ...so i'm also not wanting the douche-baggery that we witnessed to be a reflection on them. but they should know whats up.    the \"kitchen manager\" at the vegas strip location, could use a few lessons. the least of which being in the following categories:  1) having and using decorum, in general 2) the service industry, in general 3) how to NOT behave like an unprofessional, attitude-having, no-manners jackass...in general   because that there fella clearly needs some help.   when a customer orders the \"double-dog\", and just wants 2 plain dogs, with nothing on them...you'd think that's a pretty simple thing to NOT mess up.   one \"dad's\" burger, cooked medium, plain, and the \"double-dog\", PLAIN. yes, plain. there is nothing difficult about that.   especially when your cool server goes out of her way to verify \"nothing?...just 2 plain hot dogs?\" and you say \"yes\", and everyone's happy and folksy and things are going just as they should.....until some other waitstaff brings your order and the 2 hot dogs have EVERY FREAKING CONDIMENT slopped on them.   gentleman friend and i kind of exchanged looks, like...youre kidding, right? had to be the wrong table. nope there are your \"plain\" dogs.   okay....so no big deal, whatever, they go back.   and a wrong order, courtesy of the a-hole managing the kitchen, turns into a freaking debacle of jackassery, the likes of which i just could. not. believe.  he--from the kitchen, in plain view of us--VISIBLY denied getting the order wrong, gave both the innocent girl who just brought the order to our table AND our server (who took the order), a rash of sh*t, made it so beyond painfully obvious he was INSISTING that \"we\" had ordered it the way it was served, and then took his sweet a$$ time, correcting the order.   and clearly, with a grudge...as one of the two plain hot dogs that were eventually brought to the table WASNT EVEN F-CKING COOKED!!! one was obviously grilled/cooked. the other one, cold and weirdly grayish-brown.  honest to cripes, i was just looking at it like.....no.  there is NO f-cking way this just happened. but it soooo did. i was shaking my head not knowing if it was really funny or more than mildly psychotic.  i still dont know.   what i do know is this:  if your job is managing the kitchen in a restaurant on the STRIP OF LAS VEGAS, and cant even muster an above-junior-high-school level of maturity...forget professionalism at all or just behaving like a capable, balanced person...you need to be f-cking fired.   just straight fired. find something else, which doesn't involve human interaction.   \"kitchen manager's\" display was just so beyond inappropriate, that by the time our poor beleaguered server told us it had been taken off our total, i was just relieved that there wouldnt be a further scene.   we just thanked her for being cool, left a good tip, wished her a good night and got the hell out of there.   take it off our check, thanks.   that definitely makes up for you acting like a blatant jackass in front of your staff and customers. what a sack of sh-t. the burger was kind of gross, too. ordered it medium, came back practically mooing and just tasting bad.  i decided to not further test the patience of that behavioral-issue-plagued mental case and thought to myself leave it alone... i couldnt even imagine what would have come back.   $25 for a sh*tty burger and an obnoxious display. i left there cursing my own self for even suggesting we try the place and wishing we had just gone to mcdonalds instead.",

    "text": "I'm writing this with a heavy heart. I'm a fan of the Wahlburgers show and for the longest time I hoped they would open a store close to SoCal. Finally I thought my dreams came True when the one in Las Vegas opened off the strip. I recently took a trip this past weekend, I told my fiance the ONLY thing I wanted to do was have a creation built by Paul. So Saturday night after a long day of gambling we finally built up an appetite to grab some grub. I checked the hours, they close at 4:00 it was 1:30. Perfect!!! I finally can have my chance to stuff my face with burgers and fries. This was also the last weekend I gave myself to pig out before I began dieting for my wedding. So for sure I was ready to go all in with the BIGGEST juiciest burger they had.... here's where my story gets ugly, we show up I notice the chairs upside down on the tables outside. My heart sinks. There's ppl inside eating, someone even ordering at the chadors inside but all the doors were locked. I wanted to cry. Desperate and about to cry I walk away and remember they have a pop up closer to the sidewalk. I get there, it's just merch but when I ask those employees when the restaurant closes they said they were still suppose to be open?! I explain what happened even they were in disbelief and one guy walks over to the restaurant to check it out for us. Sure enough, closed. I wish I could give 5 stars, I wish I could write this review about a poor hamburger experience but I didn't even have a chance to taste one ): I'm just disappointed. I'm a fan of this family of their show and I wanted to say their good but I was let down. Please don't advertise on your website that you're open later than you are. I mean it's Las Vegas you should be open later than 1:30?!!??? That's still a half hour left to buy alcohol in California. I just don't get it ):",

    "text": "Our group of 4 decided to go here for lunch just because of the Wahlberg's name/TV show/etc. We parked at Bally's and got to the restaurant around noon (on a Wednesday). It was a nice day so I asked the hostess if we could be seated on the (empty) patio. She said they don't serve food on the patio unless you take it to go, and they weren't yet doing to go orders. She said a 15 minute wait to be seated inside, but it was less than 5.   Inside it's a cool place. The whole service is very strange though -- mix between a Smashburger/ In-N-Out/ Shake Shack and a sit down burger place. Our waiter was attentive and took our drink order (4 waters) and promptly filled 4 paper cups at the exposed Coke machine (which I later saw patrons using themselves). Three of us ordered the classic Wahlburger (one with bacon, one super well done, and one with some pink), an order of fries, an order of onion rings, and a Caesar salad. The waiter then took the order to a person working the computer at the counter. I saw several customers go up to this same individual to place to go orders.   While we waited, a woman in a Wahlburgers tshirt approached us and said they were taking free photos as part of a promotion at the restaurant. She took a group photo and presented it to us about 15 minutes later. The photo was horrible and THEN she tried to sell us copies for a \"good price\". I told her we weren't interested and she just stared at me. She finally said \"you don't like pictures?\" and I told her no, we don't like the picture. She left us the free one and then stomped away.   The food did not take too long to come out. The medium well and super well done burgers were mixed up, but everything came out okay. Everything (aside from the salad) was served in plastic baskets or paper cups. The onion rings are more like fresh made crunchy onions you put on green bean casserole, so ask for a fork. The fries were nothing special and definitely not worth the price. The burger was alright, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, at $16-20+ per person, I was expecting a burger of high quality, but it seemed no higher quality than a burger from In-N-Out. I still can't believe the burger doesn't come with fries like at a normal sit-down place. Save your money.",

I got to the restaurant at 11 sat at the bar ordered a beer number one they came in a plastic cup like I'm at a ballgame  instead of a restaurant. I ordered the Donnie burger and fries, the Donnie Virga came rare when I ordered it medium the fries were undercooked. I asked the bartender may please have some silverware and some napkins she brought me a plastic fork and plastic knife to go with my plastic cup of beer.

We had great service from our waitress- but near the end of our meal, she left and was replaced. Did not know where she went, but it looked like the women were all asked to leave the floor for a possible video shoot, since we saw cameras inside. The men who replaced our waitress seem frazzled. Some were on it, and others were hurried.  In terms of the food, I had the seasonal offering and it wasn't bad- I had to add lettuce and I would've opt'd for a lettuce bun. They have artisinal buns, but it didn't stand out to me (but it wasn't terrible by any means). Had a side of hash to share- fresh, but nothing special either.  I would come back to try another burger, but it is on the pricey side and didn't stand out greatly. I prefer Shake Shack.  The bathroom is located outside of the restaurant, around the corner - casino adjacent.",

The restaurant is interesting, patio, bar and take-out orchestrated in a strip mall/ plaza.  The staff was engaging and helpful, all seemed to work together.  My sister had macaroni & cheese that was ok but she would not re-order.  My husband had a Turkey burger with onion straws that he enjoyed.  I had a turkey cheeseburger and tater tots.  The burger was good but the tots were not hot and ruined my nostalgic moment.  I found it pricey 2 Turkey burgers and 2 tater tots $34.53   Plenty of room to sit and enjoy your meal.

Came back later as dinner delivered with a free \"postcard\" style photo, Anne 2 others you can buy.  Very interesting touch for more of a fast food style place.  Thumbs up on that concept. Husband ordered \"the one\" burger and said it was good.  I ordered the Mac n Cheese with bacon, made with \"government cheese\".   Very tasty, very government cheesy taste.  Not very hot. Also ordered their onion rings.  Almost paper thin slices of purple onion appeared to be dredged in a tempura type batter.  Good tasting, husband loved them.  Rings were definitely almost cold when they arrived. Check it out, interesting place, won't be on my list to return to in any immediate time, but I'll give it one more chance.",

The cheese was nicely melted on the beef patty. The beef patty itself lacked flavor due to a lack of seared caramelization. The bacon was completely worthless being the paper thin microwave type product. My side of fries was a big mistake as well. Dry and stale.

The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful. The onion rings were crispy but had sections that were overly salted. Ask for a side of Wahl sauce to go with the rings...makes them better. The Mac and cheese was the low point. The cheese sauce was watery and flavorless. The bacon on top was really hard and chewy, more like a jerky than bacon. I'd skip it on the next visit, for sure.   The service was a little touch and go. Our server took our order promptly but after that, was almost impossible to track down when we needed something. We had to ask another server for a soda refill and the host ended up taking our check because our server was nowhere to be found.",

The vibe is like a casual diner with table service and the food definitely isn't cheap. I opted for the Mac and cheese which sounded delicious and my friends got burgers (which do not come with fries). The mac and cheese is not worth it. It's bland, lacks flavor and the noodles were hard. I would highly not recommend it. The burgers were fine. I thought they were on the smaller side and to be completely honest, were nowhere near as good as Shake Shack (which is right down the street, has better fries, burgers and drinks/shakes) or In N Out. I'd come here purely for the novelty of it and nothing else- don't expect too much.",

I ordered a turkey fiesta burger w/fries and my wife ordered the Turkey \"Our Burger\" which comes with special Wahl sauce. She really liked the Wahl sauce but they didn't put much on it so we had to ask for an additional side of sauce. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the poor service. We weren't really sure who our server was, although we sat at the bar, one guy took our order then this other person would pop up every once in a while to see how we were doing. When we needed something, it was hard to get their attention. The staff was little overwhelmed or not on one accord to serve the customers. Hey at least the food was good.",

They have a specific menu to order from if you do this, otherwise have to order from actual menu at the wahlburgers counter Togo. Which still wasn't an issue. Honestly the best burgers we've ever had in our lives. BBQ BACON BURGER was so delicious, fresh jalapenos were perfect. Super light on the avocado spread though.  but boy oh boy the burger was crisp, hot in temperature.  ordered THE OUR BURGER and oh my gaaahhhhhh. Loaded with veggies. It was a tall burger, so fresh nothing soggy in it. I'm salivating writing this. Take me baaaccckkkkkk. Onion rings were so good too. The kids Mac and cheese taste fresh and real too. Tater tots were crispy and not too oily. All reasonably priced too.",

I'm a huge fan of this restaurant, not only because of its food and drink, but also the fun environment and that I'm a huge fan of Marky Mark! I was in the Las Vegas area with my fiance and two of our friends. We were looking for a bite to eat. We had experienced fine dining all week and even though the prices were ridiculously expensive, our meals always sucked. We just wanted a good burger. We decided upon Wahlburgers and we were able to walk right in and get a seat at the bar. We each ordered a burger and a beverage. My friend got the coffee, boozy shake and it was delicious. The girl made a shake and then gave us the extra cup and I drank off of that one. I ordered the grass fed burger and it was delicious. It was a little pricier, but totally worth it. All of our food was good, but our service was terrible. I don't think I've ever had such a rude server in my entire life. She was rude to ask, condescended to us, and berated us. I wish I knew her name, but she was so rude that she left in the middle of serving us and had another girl take over. The second girl was super sweet and we enjoyed ourselves the rest of the time. One of my friends is the nicest guy ever and he even said she was the meanest server he's ever experienced. Overall, I will always remember this experience and how rude she was! If Marky Mark knew about this he would be furious. :)",

Unfortunately, I was sooo disappointed. First, this restaurant is in open patio/bar setting. Which is ok, after all this is Vegas. For $10, I expected a gourmet burger. The hamburger came with a smashed down cold bun, another $5 for lukewarm, limp fries and $5 for a diet coke. As for service, the person who took my order was polite, but my order was literally dropped off by a different server who didn't even bring any condiments. Unable to flag down a server, I grabbed  ketchup from another table, and called out a third server for mustard and mayo. I blame my bad experience on the management at this location for there is a lack of quality control. Paul Wahlberg, I'm sure you take pride in your burger chain, but this place does not meet up to Wahlberg standards.",

They cook your burger patty to order. The burgers, fries and onion rings were awesome! We ordered the bacon Mac and cheese, WOW! The staff was very nice and Friendly. Great food at a decent price! Highly recommend this place!",

I was really looking forward to trying this place out after having seen it on TV.    I guess our first mistake was not ordering burgers at a burger place.  I ordered the Mac and Cheese and my husband order the Sloppy Joes.  My husband actually thought there was something spoiled in the Sloppy Joes and couldn't eat it.  I refused to try it.    The Mac and Cheese taste like a cup of plain penne noodles with some chunks of bacon on top.  It had absolutely zero flavor.  For reference, I have a bland palate, so for me to think something has no flavor is pretty bad.  Drinks we just ok, but at least we could consume those.  Server never asked us how the food was or asked if we wanted boxes for the food we hardly touched.    Second mistake was paying the bill without saying anything about how horrible the food was to the server.  We ended up having to go out for dinner (again) after leaving Wahlburgers.",

They weren't the BEST burgers we'd ever had, but they were still pretty decent (maybe we were just super hungry from walking around the Strip all day, haha). The staff & cashiers at the to-go station were friendly. The only thing we didn't like about this place was how small & crowded it gets. Also, this place doesn't have an actual customer restroom which was a little weird. And they could've sat people in the patio section but it was closed that afternoon for whatever reason. Our burgers & fries also came out pretty fast, so that was good. We would come back in the future.",

I ordered the melt with fries and my husband ordered the double decker with sweet potato tater tots. My husband said he enjoyed his burger and that he could taste all the ingredients and that it was flavorful including the pickles that they pickle themselves (or so I read). I stole some of his tots and those were really good, I now prefer them over the French fry version lol. The melt I ordered came with toast bread not on a bun. It was a little too greasy/oily/buttery for me, so after a good pat down I was able to eat it. The fries I got were a bit cold and weren't all that great. Its located right in front of the Bally's hotel surrounded by little shops.",

I had Donnie's favorite the barbecue bacon which comes with jalapenos boy it tasted so good meat was cooked medium well as I asked. All of our fries were crispy and are made pretty quickly idk if they just sit back there or  fried upon order but either way it still tasted fresh. in the end we wind up rushing out but wanted extra fries the guy said ill be back in a minute and he literally was.. everyone's burger was very good and made the way they wanted it..  just check where u sit because some tables and chairs were dirty i guess they need better turn around time cleaning but the food and drinks were on point i would definitely try them again wherever i find a location. Oh u dont have to get government cheese jus sub it like we did. (9/20)",

We were seated at a clean table a few minutes faster than our estimate, which also meant my boyfriend and I had to chug our cold Coronas purchased at a nearby bar advertising some BOGO special in cold weather.   The burgers were cooked to the right temperatures our whole table ordered. We had no leftovers, and it was a delicious lunch. I was impressed to find a clean burger where I didn't drip oil and grease everywhere. It was a pleasant surprise.   // Donnie's Choice x BBQ Bacon Burger: The avocado spread got me, but it was a 1/3 lb. burger (cooked to medium) topped w/ bacon, white cheddar, jalapenos, housemade bbq sauce, and avocado spread. Excellent combination to be honest. Would order again!   My boyfriend's family shared an order of fries and onion rings with the table. The onion rings is honestly a hate it or love it situation as they're very thin. I didn't mind them, but I don't care for onion rings. My boyfriend's sister was not a fan at all, but his parents thoroughly enjoyed them. The french fries were okay, though I assumed they would be a little bit better. Nothing to rave about, unfortunately.   This is a pretty good spot for lunch with pricing pretty fair. The food was good along with service. I wouldn't mind returning, but it would be hard to try something new off their menu.",

I don't frequent Vegas much, but I have a ton of clients that come through Vegas often. This is the place I send all my people to and when I'm here I make it a point to come, and to say I was let down is putting it lightly... we even had to wait about 20 mins after done eating just to get our checks to leave!! One bad experience doesn't condemn a place, but hopefully this is a one time thing... I am a big advocate for this place and don't want to start sending clients other places..",

Atmosphere - Okay I was surprised as I was thinking this was on the line of an In-N-Out burger place.  This is a sit down waiter service kind of place.  Like their logo being green the theme is carried over into the restaurant.  The aluminum chairs being that bright green and make horrible sound on the floor when moved just the wrong way.  Food   Drink - I had to try the Wahlburger beer.  Well it was blah at best.  My beer app tells me that Harpoon from Boston makes the beer.    Dinner - Name like Wahlburgers I am gonna try a burger.  I was surprised by how few specialty burger they had.  I had the Fiesta burger and it was spot and cooked to order.  They could take it to another level with avocado.  But the star for me was the fresh cut jalapeno peppers, but they had to be some of the mildest jalapenos ever.  Service - We caught them in a shift change but that did not affect their service to our table.  Future -Yes please",

The wait staff was kind and the ambiance was that if a sports bar (I mean, Vegas baby!). I said all these great things about it- the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is the price point. 15 dollars for a burger is a little crazy in my opinion. All and all you should experience this in your life, it's pretty good.",

Love the customer service, great staff and good food. Most things in Vegas are over hyped and underwhelm you when it comes to strip food. This place is a solid choice for a mid-level burger. Why not five stars?? Mr. Wahlburg, you have failed to understand the significance of quality bacon on a burger. Bacon here is of the fast food variety. Why not charge a couple more $'s and become the dominant burger in Vegas? So, I will be back, I just won't have the bacon.",

I ordered a burger & side of fries to share with my husband. I thought both were very good & decent value for the area. Others in our group got the mac & cheese (very disappointing & an artificial cheese flavor) and the chili (pretty bland even with jalepenos added).    Moral of the story - come for burgers and you'll be happy, but don't stray too far from their specialty.",

    "text": "Meh. Solid burger, but overall there's really nothing about Wahlburgers that sets it apart from its competitors. (Five Guys, Shake Shack, etc)  I'm a longtime NKOTB fan and a bigger fan of Donnie Wahlberg as a person. Because of this, I generally support /follow most of the things he does in his career. I've watched all 10 seasons of the Wahlburgers reality show on A&E and started buying Wahlburgers at home as soon as it launched. I actually liked the burgers I cooked at home so I was really excited to finally check out one of the actual restaurants.   I was in Vegas this past week with my sister and little brother. They agreed to go to Wahlburgers for me even though they really wanted to go to Gordon Ramsey's burger restaurant. We walked in on a Wednesday afternoon and got a table fairly quickly. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, but I don't recall his name.  I opted to keep it simple and went with the Our Burger minus the Wahl sauce. (my brother said later that it tasted like homemade thousand island salad dressing) I got fries and a Coke with my burger. My bro and sis also ordered burgers and they shared an order of tater tots. We all liked our burgers, but we weren't blown away with the food. The fries tasted like they came out of the freezer and the tots were too greasy. The burgers pretty much tasted like the ones I've been buying in the grocery store. That's good and bad IMO... because if I can make the same burger at home then why would I want to bother even going to the restaurant? Wahlburgers is just your average, run of the mill trendy burger joint.  The only thing that separates it from the competition is Donnie and Mark's celebrity. That's good enough to draw you in initially, but I'm not sure it'll keep you coming back. It's not a big enough draw for me and I'm admittedly a HUGE fan of Donnie's and the Wahlberg family. I will say though that the burgers are made with high quality ingredients. Wahlburgers is definitely ahead of their major competitors in that regard. A Shake Shack burger could never even touch the quality of  Wahlburgers patty.  The restaurant was clean, quiet and seemed to be efficiently run.  The theme is fitting for the Wahlberg brand and the atmosphere feels homey. Our food took less than 15 minutes to come to the table. I was more than satisfied with the service and restaurant presentation. I was going to buy a t-shirt until the waiter said they were $30! They cost $20 on the website so why would I pay $10 more for the privilege of buying it in the store? That price hike was a bit of a turn off in all honesty, but the free souvenir Wahlburgers cup was an unexpected treat. Overall, I enjoyed the experience, but probably won't go out of my way to visit another location anytime soon. IMO, Wahlburgers is more of a happen-to-be-there type of place rather than a desired destination.",

Found out from the waitress the restaurant opened just last week so perhaps some of the issues are just growing pains for a new place. Waitress was cordial & attentive, but the wait for my wife's  burger, my ceasar salad & chicken strips for our son was over 45 minutes. Saw two tables just get up & go... tired of the wait.  Food was good, especially my wife's burger, but nothing extraordinary. Two Specialty  drinks were delicious, but pricey... but then what isn't in Las Vegas?  Caught an $8.00 billing error, which they gladly corrected. Total bill was $68 & change. $31 of that was the two drinks from the bar. Overerall, with all the choices available in LV this place needs to cut down the wait time.",

I read another review it was hilarious the guy said the quality control was left in Boston - it wouldn't even matter - I'll never walk into another location. The Mac n' Cheese very sad! My husband and kids could not even find the cheese. I had the OFD the part that actually had sauce wasn't that bad. The fries and tater tots were brought cold, hard and crunchy, they did bring more same result. The Frappes were good extremely over priced! So disappointed, my son said Burger King would have been better! My husband and oldest were hungry as we left, so we had to stop and get pizza! Worst money spent this year!",

    "text": "I'm just going to start out by saying that this was seriously the BEST burger I have ever eaten in my life and I love burgers but seriously hands down the best. My boyfriend and I had just flown out to Vegas 4th of July weekend which we so happened to stumble upon a sign that said Wahlburger  on the strip and in both our thoughts we were like okay we are definitely going to try this place while we are here. So we made it upon our selfs Friday to walk there to eat when we got the the place it definitely looked packed which it was the wait time was 45 minutes and we definitely did not want to wait that long so we just decided to go the next day (we didn't realize that it has just opened up)So Saturday we go there and it even looked busier then the last day which it was because the wait time now was 1 hour and 45minutes. Definitely was disappointed but we told our selfs that Monday we have to go there since it would be our last full day in Vegas because we were heading back home Tuesday evening. So Monday morning came and we got up early got ready and headed down to see when they opened (9am is when we went there) we found out that they opened at 11am we wanted a burger there so bad and to try it out that we waited all the time so we could be the first people inline. At about 10am the manager peeked his head out to just reassure to us that we knew they opened at 11 and then i responded to him assuring him that we new but we wanted to try the place so bad we didn't mind waiting because the last two days we had tried to come the the restaurant to eat but it was such a long wait. So finally it was 11 and sure enough we were the first people that got to be seated because around 10:20-10:30 a line started forming. Anyways the burger I got was the O.F.D my boyfriend got the double decker we also got sides of sweet potato tots and thin crispy onion rings and two drinks. We got our food so fast after we ordered everything the service I'm giving a 5 star because even when we were eating people who weren't even our server kept walking up to us asking if we needed anything or how everything was. We could not believe how amazing and good of quality the food was, the burgers were cooked so perfect and I highly recommend to anyone that you need to order the thin crispy onion rings they are seriously so goooooood!! And the most amazing part of the experience is that when we asked for our check the waitress told us that the manager wanted us to have it on the house because we waited all the time till they opened. So good service, great food and I liked the atmosphere also everyone must go! And if we could get one in Seattle I would honestly go like all the time",

I think he feels it's the best cuz its named after him. The Donnie burger is basically a bacon cheese burger with bbq sauce and jalepenos. The burger is nasty!  Meat is tasteless, the jalepenos are hard and gross. And most of all, they don't grill the bun. You get a cold bun. I'm not even going to try another one being that the bun isn't even grilled.

BUT let me tell you, while eating it you wouldn't find me complaining let alone talking without a mouthful of burger. The bun (brioche style? soft, sweet, and a bit chewy) and beef were delicious. I had gotten an egg on top instead of cheese which made it even tastier. Though I do have to complain to Wahlburgers and all burger joints ever, if I say no to the cheese you put on your burgers and ask for something else listed alongside that cheese in terms of price, don't charge me extra. Jesus us lactose intolerant humans will someday revolt, it just doesn't make sense. The reason I'm not giving Wahlburgers more than a three is that their sides are basically garbage, don't bother. Tater tots? Make these at home. Onion strings? Gross, trust me.",

The cheese wasn't even slightly melted, it was actually on the cold side. Our bartender was terrible. Barely gave us any attention even when we tried waving her down. My boyfriend also got the bbq burger and they cooked his burger wrong. All in all it wasn't worth it. As a local I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.",

Horrible wait time, average ambience, food is NOT good at all for the price and would NOT be worth a repeat visit even if 50% less.  In Dorchester, maybe this flys but in this city ( a mile long ) of 35,000 places to eat, 10000 of which serve MUCH BETTER hamburgers, this place was almost funny to me. No b.s. THE most average nothing hamburger I have had almost ever in my life, including a bowling alley hamburger... Save your money and 60 minute wait time and go ANYWHERE else. Truly wondering what the F Paul is doing on the show when he pretends developing recipes and whatnot because this isnt even remotely restaurant worthy. I pray the food here is just the F U menu and not the real quality served at main restaurant. Literally wasted calories and considering taking up Bulimia due to this lunch.",

I chose the sloppy joe - no whalburger sauce. the boy chose some other burger to his liking, a drink for each and fries to share.

The portion sizes are also quite small. That was disappointing. The price of the food was too high for the quality but I understand you're paying for the name and the experience.

My boyfriend and I stopped in during our staycation walking the strip and, as we were craving burgers, decided to give this place a shot. Despite the full looking restaurant, we were seated quickly and received our drinks in paper cups (surprising for a sit-down restaurant, but charming). I ordered \"The Our Burger\" (when in Rome, am I right) and my boyfriend ordered the O.F.D. with a side of tater tots to share. let me make note, i do not like American aka \"government\" cheese so I wasn't really sure how i would like my burger but we were both blown away. He went dead silent from the moment he took a bite and when he finally came up for air all he could say was, \"wow\". Mine was also amazing - juicy, flavorful, perfectly cooked. and the tots were the perfect amount of crispy!   Driving the the strip is such a pain but i'll definitely be returning!",

I went with 3 other friends, all of whom did not want to try this place and they all had burgers and said it was the one of best burgers they ever ate so it was positive all the way around.

I got the Thanksgiving Turkey Burger which was actually pretty delicious. I wasn't sure about the squash on it and it being a turkey burger, but I have no complaints about it except that it wasn't big enough! My boyfriend had the Mom's Sloppy Joe and he really enjoyed it.

Once they start the engine going this place will rock and be one of the best additions to sin city's burger wars.  Move over shake, Ramsey, fufu waffle & gimmicky burgers - the kings have arrived!

    "text": "Came here specifically for the Impossible Burger, a newish vegan burger.  It's not on the regular menu yet, but it's on the napkin dispenser display.  It's not cheap - $19, and comes with no sides, and I got a Diet Coke which was $5 (with a plastic souvenir cup), plus tax and tip, so my whole meal was $30.  Not cheap, but it's Vegas, and I was willing to pay a little more to try the new vegan burger.  The display shows that the burger comes with special sauce (with mayo - not vegan), and cheese, and sauteed onions (not sure what they are sauteed in and forgot to ask).  So I asked for the burger vegan style, so they took off the sauce and the cheese, BUT the bun came with butter on it!  Also, not sure if the bun is vegan, and not sure if the onions are cooked in butter or oil, and not sure if they are cooked on the same grill as all the meat patties.  I ended up scraping off the buttered part of the bun with my fingers, and removing the onions, and adding some ketchup and mustard, and the burger was very tasty after that!  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they are offering the Impossible burger and want them to keep doing that, but, please be aware that vegans may come to this restaurant to try it, and they will want the rest of the burger to be vegan as well - bun, toppings, sauteed onions, etc...  So it'd be great to educate the staff about these customers and make it so you can offer a True vegan burger, and include the details on the menu about it, from the top of the bun to the bottom.  The waiter did tell me that the burger is cooked on a separate grill, which I love.  Now you just have to offer the option to make the rest of the meal totally plant-based.   Place was bright, service was friendly and quick.",

It's $13 just for the sandwich- no fries included. I upped it another star just because I told one waitress it was cold and she gave us our bill then another one asked if we wanted an adjustment. At the minimum they refunded us the money back but I definitely won't eat here again.",

    "text": "My only experience at wahlburgers sucked. We had a party of 4 and 2 kids. Of course my kids made a mess 2 seconds in the restaurant and the waiter was really nice about it and cleaned it up quick. My husband and I were so excited to try the burgers because we do watch the show! I asked for medium well for my burger and when I got it it was pink but looked past that and all order of fries were cold so we asked for fresh ones. not once did the waiter tell us the fries or any side orders were extra charge. So we finish eating and our bill comes up to be almost $80 for 2 burgers and a kids meal. And we saw they charges $15 for fries. My husband asked to speak with a manager and all she said was that Fries are an extra charge and doesn't come with our $13 burger. We refused to pay for the fries and she had to get her manager and he said the same. No apologies no nothing. We were there for about 20 min going back and fourth about the charge for the fries and they end up taking 1 Fries charge off. Still refusing to pay the manager comes back with SECURITY and a new bill with all Fries off our bill. There was no need for security when he didn't show us the last bill before he called security. The management sucked the waiter was extremely nice but could have let us know side orders are extra. Overall everything on the strip is overpriced period. But my burger was pink when I asked for medium well and they are overpriced. My Fries were cold and tasted as they've been sitting out for a while. Fries are overpriced for a small container. Fountain drinks are almost $4 so they are overpriced. Save your money save your time as well.",

The best part - the customer service! Our waitress, Alexandria H. was awesome. She visited with us, was attentive but not intrusive. We will definitely return to this burger place on our next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "A big fan of the Wahlbergs and watched the show faithfully, so needless to say I was excited to visit the restaurant.  I was initially put off when our waitress at the bar was so dismissive and super unfriendly.  Being our first visit, when we asked questions, she was very short and only gave yes no answers, didn't make recommendations or offer up anything. All the time were speaking to her, she was looking around and doing other things totally seemed uninterested in providing us any type of service.  I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger with BBQ sauce on the side, fries and a drink. My friend ordered The Our Burger with bbq sauce and Tater Tots, specifically asked for lettuce and tomato. She took our order and immediately walked away. She didn't ask if that completed our order or anything, when in fact my friend wanted a drink. While we were waiting on our order another nicer friendlier waitress came along and asked if we wanted a drink or water while we waited.   Our order comes and my BBQ Bacon burger was a bun, with patty and 2 jalapenos. The burger was supposed to have bacon, cheese, avocado spread and bbq sauce. I sent it back. It came back with more jalapenos only. I sent it back again and told them to completely do it over.   My friend's burger came out with meat, bun and signature wahl sauce. It WAS supposed to have lettuce, tomato (I mentioned earlier that she specifically requested lettuce and tomato), \"government\" cheese and housemade pickles. She also sent her burger back. She got the burger back, still no BBQ. She asked for BBQ and the 1st waitress brought her clearly what was ketchup in a cup. When we told her that is ketchup, she proceed to argue with us and tell us that \"this is ketchup (pointing to the bottle), we don't have ketchup in the cup only bbq sauce!\" We sat the ketchup she gave us and the BBQ sauce that came with my burger side by side to show her the differences that one could clearly. This waitress had the never to say, we make it homemade, so it a bit sweeter today. Seriously! As this conversation is going on I see what appears to be a manager and tell him about the service and the ketchup issue, he apologizes and keeps it pushing. What has happened to customer service?  A gentleman sitting near us ordered the sloppy joe with no onion strings...his sandwich came piled so high with onion strings it was incredible. He was so disgusted and kept shaking his head the entire time he pulled all those onion strings off. They offered to make him another one, he said never mind because it had taken so long to receive the messed up one.   Once we finally got our burgers right, they were very good, but the service left us unimpressed and not wanting to return or recommend. Just think this place has only been open for 6 weeks. This type of service usually doesn't happen this early in the game. I told my friend, the Walhbergs need to do a drop in on this place as the staff here is ruining the brand.",

Don't think he should be placed as a manager or that position of that kind of him not helping people the way how it is meant to be a manager I think Donnie Wahlberg kind of did better with his employment and stuff he needs to come back and take care of things I don't think it's right for them to give undercooked food to cook too customers! I give this place a thumbs down it is not worth taking your time or your family to this place I rather eat McDonald's then here sorry... Just speaking the truth",

The shock came when we got the bill, $49.85 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 fountain drinks. We were in utter amazement. We would have rather gone down the road and picked up Burger King, McDonalds or Carls Jr. instead as the taste of those burgers are far better IMO.

The server immediately saw when she walked by and brought it back to the kitchen. I didn't see her for about 20 minutes, when she brought the check. My husband had long finished his burger, which I told him to eat, no use in having a cold burger, and I figured it wouldn't take long to bring back my order. I informed her I had never received my sandwich, and just at that time a guy wandered by with it. By this point, I was done and ready to leave, and she removed it from the ticket.

This place is easy to get to if you are staying on the strip or just simply on the strip. I work close to the strip and we decided to choose this place for lunch and it was not easy to get too, definitely was a mission. Safe to say I won't go out of my way again to eat here. If in the area, absolutely! My boyfriend and I stayed an Bally's and ate here several times because it was close and yummy!

Walking in no one greeted us, place was filled with employees that seemed to be in private conversations with each other. We were finally seated at a sticky table top booth which ended up having trash collecting under it. Frankly, there was lots of trash on the floors and under the stools at the bar. Next surprise was the menu, it was missing the one burger I traveled all the way from California to devour, The Beast! I had to settle for the double decker and the Bbq bacon burgers. Burgers were just okay but they looked sloppy, tasted bland and our stale overcooked fries had no flavor.  Not worth the $35 we regrettfully paid. We really had hoped for so much more. We came when Wahlburgers first opened and loved it but just a couple of years later and let's just say we are shocked that Paulie hasn't shut it down and started over. The many staff members were unorganized and preoccupied with each other so they never checked on us. We even witnessed a member taking a shot at the bar before delivering a customer's drink. Some employees wore gloves and some didn't in the kitchen but no one wore beard guards even though many have long thick beards. We couldn't figure out who was in charge so we couldn't complain. We ate what we could, paid the bill and left. Please save your time and money. Skip this place until the Wahlburgers family takes a deep dive into its operations and brings it up to its family's top standards.",

I asked if it comes with it and she said we just have regular fries, giving me every indication they put it on your side and I must have missed that on the menu. Since I wasn't really looking for anything else to eat, I wound up eating about 1/5 of the fries and then the bill came with a side of fries that they regularly charge. I asked her why she didn't mention from the beginning as I didn't ask about the fries in the first place and got a dumb look and a shrug. As if people visiting Vegas don't already get screwed with overcharged items, resort fees and taxes here is another moocher working at Wahlburgers and giving me a great reason not to make a second visit at this chain.",

Tasted like dry cooked Noodles that weren't even salted!! I asked the girl at the counter if Paul or his brothers had been there yet and she told me they had not been there since it has been open. Maybe that's the problem or they should hire a quality control person!!! It was the worst!!! So sad!!! Now I can't even watch the tv show because I know now it is all just a gimmick!!

We were walking the strip and I insisted coming here for lunch, as I never seem to make it to the newly opened one in Detroit and heard good things about it. There was a wait, but we were able to sit at the bar and not have to wait for the table. Bartenders ignored us for practically 15 minutes then played it off like they thought we were still looking at the menu and said \"are you ready to order?\". Really? Our menus were put down on the bar 10 minutes ago. To be fair, after that, service was much better.  We split the double burger and tater tots and ordered 2 beers. On the menu, the double burger sounded like it was big enough to split. That was not the case. For like $11 you get a burger smaller than a Big Mac. Flavor was OK, but the bottom bun fell apart making it really messy to eat. Tater tots were lukewarm and tasted previously frozen with no salt. Would not get again.  What's weird is 1) there's no bathroom inside 2) they have photographers who come around snapping pictures of couples, printing it out and bringing it over hoping you pay the million dollars for it.  Would not go to again...any location.",

I knew about Wahlburgers due to the celebrity connection and ownership by the Wahlberg brothers (Mark and Donnie) so I thought I would give it a try just like I gave Transformers: Age of Extinction a try (Starring Mark Wahlberg).    The menu consists of traditional American food items like sandwiches, burgers, fries, tater tots, and even a few salad options for you vegans out there who also enjoy the cinematic/musical works of The Wahlberg brothers.  This location also has a bar and patio area. Staff were courteous, attentive, and provided a fun atmosphere.  Just to confirm, none of the employees are dressed in costumes based off Mark Wahlberg's cinematic characters  as I hoped there would be.  Just imagine a server dressed as Dirk Diggler.  But no, this is not a theme restaurant as I hoped but that's fine.  All the staff members wore a signature black t-shirt and pants combo similar to the fashion of Starbucks' employees.    I had the \"Our Burger\" with a side of crispy tater tots (as recommended by Paul Wahlberg's note on the menu, who is also the actual chef of the family).  It was absolutely delicious in every way.  It was surprisingly so good that I laid back in the dining booth for a moment holding my stomach just like Bruce Willis did after he got shot by Donnie Wahlberg's creepy character in The Sixth Sense.  I highly recommend this place.  I'm going to go watch their A & E show now.",

I think onion rings are in good size portion   and drinks come with free souvenir cup cost around 5 dollar as well .. free refill which is good thing lol. Burgers wasn't a big size   it like almost the size of McDonald .. cost between 12-14 .. overall it does taste good and have their own flavor .. sadly Those food got me sick dunno why .. my husband love it .. the check came out almost 45 dollar for 2 burgers and fries with one drink .. It's an experience to try this out but won't come back",

Wahlburgers was a nice change of taste for burger spots I go to. Definitely different from an In-N-Out or Smashburger, not necessarily better but different and good. Would I put it in the rankings of top favs....ehhh, doubt it as of right now, would have to try it again to really give a clear decision about that my next go in Vegas.   Had a regular cheeseburger and onion rings, which were really like onion strings. Good but I really wanted authentic onion rings...and also at that the waiter had gotten my order wrong on them at first and gave me fries. Not gonna hold that against them too much, it happens at the best of restaurants. I applaud them for lowering the awning for seating while I was dining outside and it was blazin hot out, so commend them on that.   Don't necessarily know when I will be going to Vegas next but will try Wahlburgers again and possibly give them a better review but for not they're okay.",

    "text": "Literally. I am so sad to write this review. I really wanted to love this place as much as I love the Wahlbergs and man did this place disappoint.  I was super sad. SUPER sad walking out of this place. Not just one thing happened but multiple! And I can't even comprehend how one thing just came after another.   Babe knew I really wanted to come eat here so he drove out of his way AND we paid $7 to park at the Bally's parking garage. It's a little bit of a walk to get to the actual restaurant. Upon arriving it looked pretty busy and I was so happy and excited to eat knowing it was an actual sit down restaurant with servers. I thought it was going to be something like a you order and sit down so I was wrong... and got giddy. There were a few spots open but looked like two parties ahead of us. Host thought we were party for \"Harris\" but nope we just wanted to put our name down. She said it'd be a 15 minute wait so she took our number and said they'd text us when it's ready.   We walked around the area as there are shops and bars nearby, however everything was closed at that time so we just walked and took pictures. They were pretty on point with timing. Sent us a text and even called my phone. When we were entering there was a party of three guys who were arguing with the lady asking her why they couldn't sit down in the booth to the left.. I was thinking in my head, if she lets them sit down before us and that's our table I would be so mad. She let them sit down and I was like hmmmm. She took us to a table. Ugh, that booth probably would have been for us. But I'm not picky so we just sat down.  The interior is pretty nice. Green, black, and silver is the theme. Wahlbergs everywhere. Movies and pictures. Pretty cool. Service was eh though.  I'm not mean so I'm not gonna put her name in here even though I know it... but she took our orders, and as for specific happenings... I asked for the sweet potato tots to be extra crispy because I know that sweet potatoes are never crispy when they are fried wherever you order them, and she said \"oh they're pretty crispy.\" So what do we do? Trust her. My friend asked for some sauces on the side. What do we do? Hope she brings them to us.  Our food came out in a decent manner. But the tots -- not crispy. And the sauce -- nowhere to be found. My friend asked the food runner for bbq and ranch and he brought a bunch! Thanks man! Once we started eating our server comes by out of nowhere and put my friend on blast saying  \"oh you coulda told me about your sauces why didn't you ask me\" and we were like... uhhhhhhhhhh (it was awkward the way she said it...) she did ask you.... *cricket* *cricket* Much awkwardness...  The awkwardness didn't help the fact that the food wasn't that great. And her vibe not great either. We paid for the check and she grabbed the check while we were still eating... didn't want to wait til we left to see your tip?  Anyway, food was nothing special. Service, or lack thereof, was nothing special. Maybe if the Wahlbergs show up then it'll be special. I am so disappointed!",

A few ppl in the place (more arrived after we did) the prices were a bit high but it is Vegas.  That being said the food was really good. I had the melt, fries and spiked raspberry iced tea. The burger was cooked perfect. Bread toasted just right and the fries were yummy! The spiked ice tea is DANGEROUS! Did not taste like alcohol but packed a punch. Glad that one is opening up in Chicago!",

We were greeted promptly by the friendly host but could not be seated until the whole party was there, which is pretty standard for Vegas so no big deal.  We ordered hamburgers and a chicken sandwich. My husband and I thought the food was ok. Nothing special. We also ordered French fries which were just ok too. They were actually a bit cold but nothing to complain about. The iced tea was delicious!! Our server was friendly and kept swinging by to make sure that everything was good!  I would give 4 stars but I took one away due to the photographer and pushiness of trying to get us to buy the photo. They come to your table and ask if they can take your picture and you will receive a free postcard. Which is all True! But of course there is a catch and they want you to buy multiple pictures. She didn't take our \"no thank you\" too graciously and seemed really bothered that we didn't buy the pictures. I get it. It's Vegas. But when you are constantly hounded to buy something every 500 feet on the strip, it would be nice to go inside and restaurant and eat in peace and not have to worry about being pushed by a salesperson. Honestly, if you want THE best burger, go to Gordon Ramsay Burger in Planet Hollywood! So delicious!!!!",

    "text": "Good spot and alternative to the expensive spots in LV. Recommended if you are tired of gorging from the buffets and after watching the Bellagio fountain show!     1). Food. Very tasty burgers. I thought it was going to be bland but it was surprisingly better than what I expected. Very generous portions with the fries we were provided. Highly recommended.   - ordered the onion rings. They were the thin ones and were very tasty. Not the usual thick onion rings. Highly recommended, as well. Large portions provided.  - the burger salad is very good if you are looking for lesser carb options. It tastes like a cheeseburger with lots of lettuce. Again, they put a lot of burgers with this choice. I usually avoid the tomatoes but ate them in the salad.      2). Customer service. Very attentive and responsive. No issues here.      3). Atmosphere.  Lots of options in the area if this pace doesn't cut it.     - Could get loud due to the music.     - Can get busy so check the other options or when you go here.     - Good vibe due to its location and other neighboring restaurants and stores.      4). Others.     - Lots of pedestrian traffic.     - No parking.     - Good with kids.     - across the street from the Bellagio.     - sorry no pictures. Cant leave any evidence that might incriminate, right?     Better than average burgers with good service. Highly recommended place. No need to roll the dice and look for a cheaper/better alternative. This place will be fine to satisfy the munchies. 1* less due to loud music in the location. Who knows, you might see Marky Mark at this location.",

    "text": "I stopped into the Las Vegas outpost of Wahlburger to have the double-decker burger, which was surprisingly not shitty. This was my first experience at any Wahlburger, and I expected to be writing this review with a vituperative bent but I have nothing but good things to say about this burger: beefy, well-seasoned, well-flavored, lovely melty cheese -- and an outer char on both 3-ounce patties that was delicious and texturally nice. Thick crispy pickle slices were mild and pleasant, obviously made in house instead of being jarred or canned. The \"Wahl\" sauce, the so-called family secret, tasted like Thousand Island dressing mixed with Sriracha Sauce. It served the burger well.   I'm from the Boston area originally, which is not a burger-y part of the country, so it's not like Wahlburger is representing a cuisine or is \"serious food.\" Indeed, there's no regional yardstick to measure Wahlburger's \"authenticity\" against -- although the Las Vegas service staff is undoubtedly more attractive than you would find in Massachusetts. Beyond that, this really is its own thing. I don't watch the show, nor do I care to. Judging the product by what was served to me, I was very pleased -- my only big quibble being that $13 feels like the wrong price on the Vegas strip, where good, cheap burgers are plentiful.

It was dirty, the service wasn't great, their drink menu was really limited in comparison to the other location.   I had a cocktail that was so weak it was laughable. Not sure there was alcohol in it, to be honest. The burger was pretty good, I was starving so I wasn't picky. The sweet potato tots were pretty good too.   Overall, it was ok. But with Burger Brasserie and BurGR in walking distance they need to pick it up.   \"Maak, Dorney and Pwual\" need to look into the management of this place.  3 stars.",

It's a fast food type place, underwhelming to me unfortunately, very industrial looking. I was hoping to find more healthy options on the menu. Even though the caloric count is on each menu item, the food really didn't fit into my WW lifestyle. I ended up eating Jenn's salad with chicken. Thankfully, I asked for the dressing on the side as it was a very thick creamy dressing, something I normally wouldn't eat.  My salad was topped with a lot of fried onions, which again I avoid fried foods. Eating a salad doesn't mean it's healthy when there's a thick creamy dressing and fried food on it. The greens and moist chicken breast was definitely healthy, though.  All in all, I wouldn't dine at their restaurant again, but I did enjoy seeing what it was like and now I can say dined there.",

The incredible burger is not on the menu yet but on the napkin holder.   We also split the onion rings and bacon Mac and cheese.  We were stuffed and left plenty behind. The incredible burger I had a bite of and it has a unique and good flavor. Bacon cheeseburger was predictable.  Found out when the check came the incredible burger was $18.95...  It was an experience and vacation so what the heck.  Would we recommend it to others sure. Would we do it again likely but only split 1 side.",

I've had a lot of good burgers but what makes this place different is the bun for starters which is what you would least expect when having a hamburger. But as for the meat it is perfectly seasoned And don't know with what, plus if you do medium cooked like don't mind a little pink it makes it 10 times more tastier!!   Other than the burger I would say that's just about it that stands out compared to other spots. So when it comes to fries and other sides I think they can add a little something better because those are just OK.",

Although it is a valid point, I mean you are literally dining in the shadow of some very fine establishments, there is also space for all in this surreal place on planet earth. My beef, no pun intended with Wahlburgers here is not the service, which was about what you would expect at chain burger joint, nor the ambiance... or lack thereof. My main problem is with how the completely ruined the Impossible burger. I am sure if the purveyor see the appalling manner in which they are presenting this burger, they would pull it from the establishment.  I am perfectly fine with the fact that I am paying more for this product, it is expected and accepted, however, for them through on a bun with such disregard for its integrity is unacceptable.  I choose to eat a meatless product, and Wahlburgers chooses to sell it to me, at least do your best to present it properly. It wasn't all gloom and doom, service was warm, my beer was cold and overall, I had a pretty good time.",

Our waiter happily obliged when I asked for a sample of Alma's Mac Salad. I ended up ordering a side for $6.95. Nice balance of creaminess & acidity, liked the crunch from the diced sweet peppers.  As much as I wanted the Impossible Burger, I wanted to try their Portobello Sandwich more ($11.95.) I found it needed a crunchy element to compliment the soft bun, soft filling, etc. Bf ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger ($12.95) & we both added on a fried egg for $1. FYI: the famed wahl sauce tastes strikingly similar to thousand island dressing.   The verdict: Unless Donnie or Mark is personally flippin' my burger (& no, you're not mistaken, that phrase IS full of innuendo), there are other burger joints I'd rather return to.",

The burger was cooked to perfection, all the right toppings with the extra jalapenos was awesome. A burger i appreciate and would recommend to anyone and everyone. The sweet potato tots were Devine and made the meal so yummy. Yummy not very professional but a great descriptive word.   Walburgers I will be back and not as star struck.

The beef patties were spiced well and slightly more done than I'd like them even if it was by design to be charred.  The pepper jack cheese was melted perfectly over the patties.  The burger veggies were very fresh and very generously assembled.  The bun however wasn't anything special and could have been better a better ensemble with a more desirable bread.   Two kinds of tater tots were both forgettable.  The standard Tater Tots seemed to be sitting for a while after frying and were crisp when crunchy was expected.  The Sweet Potato Tots wasn't crispy or crunchy.  They were soggy and totally forgettable.  Between a party of four, perhaps four Sweet Potato Tots were eaten.  This Wahlburgers is slightly hidden in a section right in front of Bally's.  It wasn't easy to find without specifically knowing it was there.  Finally the service was friendly and attentive.  A good choice for an evening bite on the Vegas strip.",

We had also had less than satisfactory experiences at other restaurants along the Las Vegas strip.   Wahlburgers blew us away and helped turn our trip back on a positive note especially since we were here to celebrate our anniversary (today). The burgers were really savory and delicious. I was sceptical about the onion rings when they came out but once I tasted them I kept diving back in for more, they were just that good. My husband got tater tots and said they were great as well. My husband got a a spiked strawberry lemonade drink which was good. I got a chocolate drink of some sort which did not taste good at all but our waitress was so nice and she noticed I didn't like it and offered to switch it for a strawberry colada (pictured) which was ten times better. I just want to give a shout out to her (sorry I don't know her name) but she was awesome!  Thank you Walhburgers for the great experience!",

It was a total letdown. The burgers were okay. The fries were nasty. I would not patronize this business ever again. What a waste of money.  Update....Now I literally have diarrhea! I am beyond upset now. My remaining vacation has been ruined.   You've been warned.",

The sweet potato tots are great ! The staff is always nice and the food comes out pretty fast. You even get to keep the cup that your drink comes in . Although it can be a big pricey ... it's much better in pricing than most of the places on the strip . Give it a try .",

The wally sauce is amazing and they make their own pickles which are some of the best I've ever had and I hail from strong bohemian roots. The service was great and what I love is they took my number so I went and gambled and then they texted me when my table was ready!!!! That is amazing plus beers are served in cans or by draft which adds to awesomeness. Yes prices are a little higher than needed but it's Vegas, centrally located and great service. I will gladly pay more for a well cooked hamburger. The tater tots are great too!!!! Definitely check it out. Plus there's an Irish fella that makes you feel right at home. Can't wait for local deals to come!!!!! Will definitely go back",

The set up of the restaurant is not very inviting... There is absolutely no memorabilia of NKOTB or Mark which was something that would be appealing I would think to those fans that follow them. I for one will never eat at this establishment ever again... If the Wahlberg's are serious about the fan experience well then they dropped the ball on this one and need to revisit this restaurant for sure.",

It was too hot to enjoy my meal. I had a grilled chicken Cesar salad. It was the worst. A bunch of lettuce, I could hardly see or taste the chicken. And the dressing was very bland. Also, I didn't like using plastic utensils...ugh....try cutting a salad up with plastic utensils.   My friend had a burger which was just ok, she has tasted better. The onions rings were horrible....little dried up pieces of onions. Not your typical fried onion rings. And finally there is no restroom for customers. You had to leave the restaurant and go outside on the side of the restaurant to use a public bathroom. That is against the law....when you are serving more than 10 people you are supposed to have a restroom inside for customers to use. I wanted to wash my hands and I had to go over to a sink inside the restaurant to do that. I was very, very disappointed.",

We weren't hungry at all, but ordered something just for the experience. We ordered a party melt with bacon, tots and 2 drinks. Burger was greasy, tots were just tots. Nothing special anyone could make tots. How about some melted cheese, chives and a dollop of sour cream perhaps?  Cost was $25. One burger tots and 2 ice teas!  The capper of the experience was my wife had to use the restroom. It was outside of the restraint in the shopping village, where she ran into two individuals who took up residence in the ladies restroom for the day or week. She was not happy about having to dodge those two. Needless to say, she held it and we went elsewhere. It may not be fair of us to \"expect\" more from this experience, because we \"know\" the Walbergs from the show. I guess. But I won't go back. Sorry. Watch the show and save your dough.

It was delicious and the atmosphere was very friendly and overall just very happy!

The waiter apologized and was very honest about the restaurant not being open long. Let me fill you in on the prices so you are AWARE. Burgers are a bit pricey ($10-13) & be ready to spend $5 for a side of fries because combos do not exist. The fries are good but order them FRESH! The drinks are about $. I hope the family gets their restaurant up to par. I would hate to read more negative reviews. On the plus side: the waiter was the one who encouraged the manager to take 50% off of the bill. Our total would have been $84!!!! That's just for 4 burgers. 2 kids meal. 3 drinks (my husband got water!!). A side of fries & a side of onion rings.",

So I said, I guess I'll sit down, eat it quickly and go. Sat at the bar and placed my order. I'm sitting down, a bit edgy because not only do I have to get somewhere by 12:30 am, I've got to eat this too. Sometime around 11:20 to 11:30, I see a guy leave with a big bag of takeout, and I'm like, what is going on? The host basically lied to me. Not sure what her hustle is, but I'm guessing the whole goal was to get people to sit down, drink and order more, in addition to getting tips for the staff. Nice hustle. So I'm waiting, and this bar manager, Irish guy, winks at me!!! What in the world??? I'm not like that, men don't do that to other men where I'm from. I go off on the guy about what is going on and demand my order to go. I had enough and called them out about what was going on. I got my order, paid what was owed and kept the 20% tip I was going to give.  I was going to go to the Coney Island location in NYC a week ago, but decided not to because of the location, bad yelp reviews about service and other things. Come to Las Vegas, I've gotten bad service here too. The burger was alright, but honestly, there's so much competition, I won't ever go to a Wahlburger's in Vegas, NYC or Detroit. Get your staff in order Mark.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try Wahlburgers since I found out they opened. I was in town for a wedding and took the wedding party after the wedding to grab a bite to eat after the wedding on Saturday night. (Group of 8) After being greeted by the hostess I was directed to order at the counter. I told the my group to place their order and then find a seat inside since we are such a large group. My bill was $110 and we ordered items from a burger, chicken strips, mac & cheese, tater tots, sweet potato taters, fries, chicken sandwich and more. As we sat we were told since we ordered at the counter we had to sit in their patio even though we were directed to order at the counter by the hostess. We went outside and found table and chairs piled on the side which we had to put together ourselves with no assistance from the employees from Wahlburgers. Then security of the area told us we as the group were not allowed to put it together and were condescending (Mark Security). I was confused because the employees from the inside were looking at us but not assisting. I then asked the hostess to help us and still after 15 minutes no assistance. We then received our food and 3 of our orders were wrong. We brought the items back and were told in a condescending tone why are we coming back inside and what did we need. Obviously with a burger at hand there was something wrong. I then directed to speak to a manager and expressed my disappointment with he service and that the burger was supposed to not have cheese and several items that were wrong with our order. Tater tots were soggy, burger was mediocre and service put me over the top of why I gave this place a 1 star. I hope management can review this and help with quality of food and service and help train with customer service.",

Very loud and pricy.   Beer was cold - for what that is worth. Should expect that in 2016!!",

    "text": "While on the strip we decided to try this restaurant out.  First, the hostess was a little annoyed that we did not have cell phones so they could text us when our table was ready.  She told us to stand by her so she didn't forget us, then said it would be about 45 minutes.  This was her best solution to people (rare as it is) who do not take their cell phones everywhere.  Anyway, went in, saw the menu and first thing I thought way ...Geez Wahlberg brothers;  you don't make enough money so you have to charge Ala carte for fries with a sandwich.  I realize this is on the strip and rent must be high, but seriously????  I will say thank you for making the plain burger a dollar less then the cheeseburger...more places need to do this. We waited about half hour for our food to come out.  The burgers were good, nothing special.   My husband had ordered the pulled pork on his burger and had to drain half a cup of oil off the pork before he could eat it.  Truly, the entire bottom of his basket was dripping as was the burger.  He called the server over and told her and her reply was \"Yes, it is oily\" then brought him napkins to wipe up the oil that was now on the table. The family \"special\" sauce tasted just like thousand island dressing without the relish.  While we were waiting a lady came and asked if we wanted a free picture postcard;  we said no.  She replied \"but it is free\".  We said no again.  Again she said it is free, you don't have to buy anything (I understand the concept of free lady)Really, I am hanging out with my husband and you are bothering me????  when we received our bill there was a $4.95 charge for the pulled pork but the menu said this add on item was $1.  when I questioned the server she said \"Sorry, sometimes the kitchen gets confused\".  Not sure what that is all about as she rang up our bill, but he removed it.  The place is VERY noisy!  but it was nice looking at the pictures.",

There was no cover so depending on where you sit in the restaurant you will have complete cover or no cover at all. Bring your shades just in case. My brother had the our burger, my mom had a chicken sandwich, and I had the patty melt I thought the menu was pricey overall with each meal costing around 11-13 each and everything was a la carte. My soft drink was $4, the side of fries and shoe string onion rings were $5 each and the portions were small The melt wasn't very good overall. The cheese was barely melted and the mustard in my opinion ruined the sandwich. My mom woke up in the middle of the night to throw up. She blamed the carmelized onions from her chicken sandwich. My brother said his burger was okay overall but nothing special. I would try it once if you are curious about the restaurant and in the area or just fans of the walhburgs which we are. I don't think we'll be going back.",

While eating, the Manager (Edgar) came over to make sure everything was going good. He made us feel soo welcomed to be there. I would recommend you to stop by and enjoy the great time.

If you don't want to wait for hours, pay overprice food, go to wahlburgers. BTW, I'm not paid or smothered to write these experience like those others reviews who are with your essay comment lol and negative reviews. If you expect highend 10 dollar burgers, and complain about it, go to Ramsay's burger.",

The flavor didn't pop quite as much as I was hoping for, but I still enjoyed it.  The sweet potato tots were pretty great!  All in all everything was good, especially for a reasonably priced quick meal on the strip, and I'd go back again.",

First of all, the waitress (who im pretty sure was a manager) didn't really have time to take our order, and s he didn't even come around to our table and just talked to us from the opposite side of our table which was the entrance so she wasn't too interested in giving us any suggestions and she seemed afraid and pretty annoyed to have to serve  us.  I neglected to tell her that wanted a gluten free bun so i quickly got up to go tell her. She was very annoyed by my request but she went around and told the cooks then came back out but ignored me. I asked \"will that be ok\" and she just walked by me, didn't look at me, and said \"yeah\".  I guess someone needs a break.  The entire staff seemed to be off in general., non attentive or friendly   When we finally received our food it was cold. We ordered Paul's favorite burgers, tater tots and fries. Everything was cold and the burgers didn't even have the secret sauce or enough government cheese. Big disappointment.... don't recommend.... won't be back.",

We shared an order of fries, which had the potential to be good if they were hot and fresh out of the fryer, but they weren't. The major problem for me was the service - I've had better service at Applebee's. With most restaurants having great service on the Las Vegas strip, Wahlburgers really needs to step up their game.",

She responded they were reserved for reservations which in the same sentence she stated they do  not take reservations she proceeded to become very nasty with me and said she didn't have to seat us if she didn't want to and asked if i wanted to put my name down or not ? I asked to speak to a manager while i wanted to leave i had just walked there it was late and i wanted to feed my children a very polite gentleman came out his name was Ricardo! He apologized and seated us immediately. He stated  she was new he came by to check on us even though we weren't in his section and gave my kids Wahlburgers cups our waitress was very polite as well.  The food however was not good my daughter didn't like the ranch dressing or the breading in her chicken i didn't care for the BBQ sauce it had a very odd flavor. Ricardo went out of his way to make the experience pleasant however Sasha is the first person you are greeted by which didn't show any Politeness at all ! In addition to that the empty tables remained empty while we ate our meal I'm not sure if this Was some sort of discrimination which i wouldn't expect from a family establishment that is portrayed by the Wahlburgers but i must say it wasn't at all what i expected very sad i was looking forward to it so was my daughter",

Moist burgers, fresh produce, crisp fries (or tots). If you like burgers, you gotta check this place out. I would like to see customer service consistently good but other than that, no complaints. Overall, Wahlburgers is a great spot to grab some grub for a cheaper price on the strip. Definitely worth checking out!",

The bun was soft and sweet with a buttery and crisp taste. The burger was fresh and cooked to exactly how I requested it, medium-well. The food came out fat. It isn't a walk up and order restaurant. You do have to sit down and order but you probably can call it in. It was pretty packed and the burger is about the $10-15 range and fries or tots are an extra $4. It can be a bit pricey for what you get but I guess for Vegas anyways this is normal pricing. My husband and I thought the service was fast and friendly and they definitely tended to us.

We went across the way to a bar to have a drink while waiting. They texted us almost exactly at 15 minutes. I had the \"Our burger\" cooked medium. I would say it was slightly undercooked but not bad. The flavor was good, however, my bun got soggy and started falling apart by my third bite. I also ordered the bacon Mac n' Cheese. Next time this is a definite pass. It was very soupy and somewhat bland. Now that I have checked Wahlburgers off my list of places to try I probably won't be back. It's safe to say there are far better burger place to eat at on the strip.",

    "text": "When eating in Vegas there are so many choices to pick from but you would have to be crazy not to try Marky Mark's restaurant. I was really shocked when the food was actually amazing.   I also like that you don't just walk in and pick a seat. You have to wait to be seated so you get noticed when you walk in.   I got the OUR burger and the mac n cheese. Next time I might skip the macaroni but the cheeseburger was absolutely delightful. The burger you could tell was actual not frozen beef burger. Everything about it was delicious. It's pretty expensive and everything is ala carte. You also get a complimentry photo! But, it's pretty small so you do get a choice to buy a bigger picture, which of course I did.   You should try this place out! It's pretty great.",

    "text": "Big fan of the show from the start and was watching since the beginning when the first Wahlburgers was open. So when I saw the opening of the one in Vegas I had to go next time I was there.   Very packed inside and a 30 min wait but the patio was empty.So our group decided to just order it and take it out. Ordered our food and it came out pretty quick. We paid over $100.00 for all of us(4 people) and asked if we can eat it on the covered patio. They said no. The patio witch had around 20 seats empty and no one outside because it was cold. They refused to let us sit there. I told them politely we would clean up after ourselves but still they said no. Not great customer service in my opinion after we spent over $100.00 dollars there for burgers. The lady told us to sit on the table/chairs way away from the place. Kinda windy outside so it ruined the enjoyment of eating there.   Menu was great.  Allot of choices from chicken sandwiches, chicken salads to burgers. Comfort sides like chili and Mac n cheese.  We got the Our Burgers with bacon. Great cheese selection too. Prices for gourmet burgers were decently priced $11.00 The burgers were great.  Onion rings cut a little too thin for my taste. Pieces were too small and had to eat it with a fork. Good though. Seasoned well.  Fries were thick and good.  The shakes and soft drinks were pricey because they all came in souvenir cups. That should be a option, not mandatory. Shakes were really good though.   The food was great but the customer service could use some help. That can be fixed but that's the most important part of running a successful business. The people and common curtesy must stand out from other establishments.   Competition for good burgers is every where in Vegas so they need to fix the customer service portion out quick.  Fix the customers service portion and I would rate it higher.",

By the time we got the food it was sat on the bar directly under the blower and was completely cold in 2 maybe 3 minutes.  This is the entirety of my reasoning for the 1 star rating.

The sauce was great, although I have no idea what it was. The best part of the meal were the onion \"rings.\" Really they are onion strings or straws, but who cares because they were delicious! Quite salty, but excellent batter and seasoning! My friends ordered the macaroni and cheese and added chicken. The pasta was a penne which threw me, but the chicken was seasoned with something and delicious. It looked like a side dish, because it came in a to go side cup, but was very filling according to my friends. I just had a bite. Prices were steep, but maybe just because of the Vegas location?",

    "text": "We went for dinner after being tired of paying $20-$40 for a bad burger in several high-end restaurants that advertise famous burgers. We waited for around 20 minutes outside and were then quickly seated. The restaurant is noisy as expected and the service staff could use some training in consistency as we rarely saw our waiter and there was no attempt to refill drinks even though they would refill one if asked but not offer to do others at the same table. The guy cleaning the tables was the most attentive person there.   The burger wasn't bad at all and was probably one of the better ones we had during this trip. It isn't amazing but you can expect good meat, fresh vegetables and a decent experience. This is tailored more towards the fast-food side of eating and was $75.00 for three people. We got three burgers (Own Burgers), onion rings and fries. The onion rings were oddly dry and perhaps overcooked but we liked the thin cut style. Fries were generic but hot and crispy. We also tried the cupcakes which are very home-made tasting but in our case were very dry as well.   Our only real complaint was the service and the pricing. We have been trained here in LV to expect and accept both bad service and high prices so maybe that was just par for the course.  We would return if we wanted a quick bite before a show. It is too bad that you have to pass so many naked people and crazies on the way there along the strip so if you are taking kids especially at night and walking there be aware of that issue.",

Then again, it's Vegas and I cant complain because I'm the type to start drinking the minute I open my eyes in the AM (while on vacation only, of course!!!). The light fixtures are cool. Each one has a list of the movies, boybands, shows and family members.   The food: My husband ordered the BBQ Bacon (Donnie's fave) w/jalapenos on the side.  I ordered the \"O.F.D\" with blue cheese. I had a FOODGASM (not a fake one either).  The meat was fresh, the bun wasn't soggy, and the blue cheese was on OVERLOAD.. Pure Perfection.  The Service:  It was pretty prompt. The only \"eh\" I have was that 1, we were seated in the back, closest to what I am assuming is the part of the kitchen. The garbage passed by our table a few times. Not a good aroma when you're eating blue cheese. #NoBueno Oh, and 2, our server just gave us water. Not \"can I get you anything to drink?\" It was just \"here, you need water\", as if he knew that we had been in a drunken stupor just hours prior to coming here. LOL  Verdict: WE WILL BE BACK. The ambiance was fun, and everyone was upbeat. The food was delicious (and I dont even like to eat burgers in a restaurant). The only thing that would've been better wouldve been to have Paul  make the food himself. LOL (Or a glimps of Donnie or/and Mark) lol. #WishfulThinking    Buen Provecho",

When I heard ketchup, I said I'd prefer the chipotle mayonnaise.  I also asked for a side of avocado.  My husband reiterated the avocado when she verbally told us our order.  When the meal was received, no avocado.  Took a few bites of my bowl and it was Sriracha and not chipotle sauce.  When I mentioned this I was told I was wrong.

However, it took about 10 minutes for a server to come and take our order. Since we had waited so long, we knew exactly what we wanted and placed the order along with our drinks. Drinks came out in about 5 minutes but the food took over 25 minutes. We actually thought the server forgot about us.   Once the food came out, my husband noticed they did not grill the onions like he had asked. And the meat on our hamburgers were quite pink. The server never asked how we wanted the meat cooked, so we assumed it was going to be cooked all the way thru. We still ate the burgers, and did like it, however I would've preferred the patty be cooked a little bit more. The tater tots were pretty good, crispy and well seasoned.  I'm only giving a 4 star because I was not impressed with the price. The basic burgers were overpriced at $9.95 and add ons were $1.00 more each (cheese, grilled onions). And they did not come with a side. Sides were $4.95. I also ordered a root beer and that was $4.95. Totally ridiculous! I wasn't eating at a gourmet restaurant, it was more like a sit down fast food restaurant. So the pricing was a bit too much.  Needless to say, we won't be returning anytime soon unless they include a side with the burgers. I could easily go to another burger place and order a cheeseburger and fries for less than $10.",

The burger was great. I got sweet potato tots on the side. They have sugar added as noted on the menu. I ordered them but they were a bit too sweet for me. Liked the idea of a souvenir photo while at the restaurant but not while we're sitting down to eat. Felt trapped into taking and purchasing a photo. I didn't come here for a photo. I get up selling for cash flow but maybe before the party is seated in a designated area and then approached about purchase at point of paying for the bill instead. Food overall was good.",

    "text": "I recommended this restaurant to an out of town VIP client that wanted a 'great burger'. They wanted to try something the Bay Area did not have; Five Guys and In 'N Out was out of the question. They also were not looking for a foie gras with gold flakes rendition of a burger. They just wanted a 'great burger'. I normally only recommend to my friends and clients places that I personally have made a cameo before, but somehow I don't know why I said \"Wahlburgers\". So off they go!  The next day, I see my clients and they asked why I had sent them there!  I will spare all of you the details my clients gave me, but I needed to try this for myself. So I decided to go the next day as soon as they opened around 11 a.m. so I could avoid the tourist lines.  Although there was no wait at around 11:30ish, there was a good deal of patrons already sitting inside the restaurant including the bar.  I decided to take a seat at the outside bar stool which was probably my biggest mistake. They air ducts pushing air out to keep bugs from coming in to the restaurant were at full blast!  I felt I was Donna Summers in concert when she sings in front of an air blower to push her wild hair all over the place!  I could have easily moved, but there truly was no other place to sit at the bar at this point.  I ordered a Blue Moon while the bartender brought me a menu.  As I took my first sip, I scanned the location of this property and it immediately gave me a flashback of when I was in Bangkok eating by the public markets watching a cobra being tamed! At least in Bangkok there was some great views...This location is containers converted to shops, and very loud. There is construction everywhere.  If you think you will have location of the Strip, think again....this is not the place for you.  But alas....I am here to review the food.  The burger was decent, nothing great.  I asked the bartender to substitute the raw onions for grilled, they decided to charge me the additional $1 for it even though it was a substitute.  Of course, when I got my burger, there was no onions at all.  I decided not to wait for the onions and told the bartender to 86 the onions from my bill. She didn't apologize, but just said she would take it off my bill.    Overall, the food is okay.....the burger was good; cooked to my temperature, tater tots were nothing to brag about; you could find these at your local elementary school during mystery meat Friday's. The service.... not the best. They need to work on it.  Bartender was confused and truly didn't care whether or not the order was correct. You could tell she was just clocking in and clocking out to get base salary and tips.    I can see why my clients from San Francisco lectured me on my choice of restaurant.  The two stars is for the ice cold Blue Moon I had and they were able to get my burger patty medium rare. Love the Wahlberg family; great actors and singers, but stick to your Calvin Klein panties and leave the restaurant industry to those who get it.  Also, I would look for a new scout location manager, no offense...could have done better with the property.",

One of my friends ordered his burger well-done and said it lacked flavor, so maybe there's something to be said about avoiding over-cooked orders (order at least medium or medium rare!). Service was friendly, attentive, and helpful. I was a bit sad to see them close about 15 minutes early the next night - I was hoping to place a quick to-go order before wrapping up for the night.

A side of fries/tater tots/sweet potato tots was an additional $4.95. However,  service was awesome! To me, it's an overpriced burger joint that sells alcohol and has a host that seats you. It's like going to Five Guys but waiting to be seated, with a bar. The decor is very casual, which is why i was perplexed at the necessity of a host. But, given that there were a lot of people i do understand the need to control traffic. I sat at the bar and didn't have to wait. But if i needed a table it was a 15 minute wait. The curiosity of going to a celebrity's restaurant lured most people in. The desire for me to eat something quick and new was what lured me in. It was when i got there that i learned of the Wahlberg Family. I do recommend trying it but be warned that portion sizes don't match their prices. For a $13 burger i expect grass-fed meat and cheese; nitrite & nitrate free, uncured bacon, on a sprouted grain bun LOL! You get my drift, right)?",

    "text": "FANTASTIC. Celiacs, they have GLUTEN FREE buns, bread, and croutons- all house made! I had the \"our\" burger (gluten free bun) with tater tots and my boyfriend had the BBQ burger with sweet potato tots. Tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced. We ended up going back before we ended our trip! This place is a must. Big THANK YOU to the Wahlberg family for creating the most accommodating restaurant for people who cannot eat wheat gluten that I've ever eaten at. To have not only the option to eat a burger the way it's meant to be eaten (not lettuce wrapped), but to offer the same accommodation for sandwiches and even croutons on a salad is just beyond thoughtful and considerate. It's not a small thing, so thank you so much.",

The hamburgers live up to the hype on the show. Not the best ever, but top 5 for sure. The bun, pickles, government cheese and meat. Give the burger a try with caramelized onions. It is a winner. Location is a bit off and sad. Kinda hidden in a no name plaza with no name stores. But at least Starbucks is next door to help with the food coma of overeating all those sweet potatoe tots",

The servers were polite, but it took forever for the kitchen to make our food. Then when it finally came, we were missing one of the meals. When that finally arrived, it was incorrect. It was not all that busy at the time. The burger was not great, but the sweet potato tots were very good. Their idea of BBQ is a ketchup with more vinegar. A recipe they need to rethink. I can say I've been here, but not impressed at all.",

As we got seated at the bar, the couple next to us was raving about their meal- things seemed to be looking up.  But despite ordering a wide swath of the menu, most dishes had execution issues: the thin-cut onion rings were arguably the best dish we tried, but were served cold. The patty melt we ordered featured unmelted \"government\" cheese and an overcooked patty, not sure how the kitchen managed that unless the patties are precooked. The house-made pickles and Wahl sauce were tasty, but not enough to save that burger. Added on Alma's Famous Macaroni per raves from other reviews, belatedly realizing this was a pasta salad. It was fresh with lots of chopped vegetables but seemed to be missing something in the unbalanced flavors. Tried to end our meal on a high note with a spiked milkshake, but the Fluffanuttah didn't look or taste at all like the menu description.   Not sure how this place stays so packed- the wait for a table was 30 minutes even after the lunch rush on a weekday. Prices are standard for the Strip location, but the quality is subpar.",

With a recommendation from my neighbor, he gave high praises and said that we have to go to Wahlburgers while we're in Vegas.  I'm a little shy about trying a celebrity joint because it can be \"overrated\" however I will give it a try when it's recommended by a friend.    There was a short line, hostess said our wait will be 20 minutes or a table for 3.  Well, we got a text within 5 minutes saying our table was ready.  That was quick.  The menu is pretty basic, burgers, fries, tots, pasta and salad.  They have items that they co-created with other celebrities like P-Diddy (Aqua Hydrate).  I ordered that and it taste like water!  We all ordered the same burger - The \"Our Burger\" with the fixings that we wanted and we all agreed that it was really good and exceeded our expectation.  Hubby ordered regulars fries and he said it was ok, I got the tots extra crispy and I liked it, our friend onion strings and she really liked it but it taste better when it first comes out hot.    Your burger is cooked to order so sit there and have a good ole' conversation with your peeps and make some memories with selfies while you are there waiting for your food.  I liked that the fountain drinks came with a take home cup with free refills.  They also have desserts but we were stuffed to sample any.  I love burgers and it was cooked perfectly and I normally stay off the strip.  Next visit I will Uber it again to this spot!",

Service was incredibly fast and they're open until 4am. The hostess out front was very kind and professional.  Our order was correct and each of our burgers were cooked precisely right (they actually know the difference between medium rare and well.) They weren't greasy at all and the tots weren't too salty. We'll happily return.",

    "text": "So I was super excited to try the Wahlbergs restaurant and I must say it was not a disappointment.! We went on a rainy day in Vegas but we still sat outside which was covered. I would say we waited about 20 min before we were seated which wasn't to bad because they were extremely busy. After we were seated they took our drink orders right away. And when they came back with the drinks we placed our entree orders. I ended up going with the double stacked burger and I added pulled pork to that. It only took about ten minutes before the food came out so that was great total time we were there was a little less than an hour. When the food came out I was surprised how big the burger was. It was just dripping in sause and stacked with pulled pork! It was so delicious the burger was cooked perfectly and that pulled pork was amazing! I would advise to definitely add it to your burger it's so worth it! I would for sure re visit this place! And their Wahlberg sauce is so amazing make sure you try that for your fries or tots!",

Today, however, I had been walking the strip a lot and was tired and ordered my food to go. They asked how I wanted my burger cooked, and I asked for no pink. I got my order and walked to my room at Paris - not too far. I was so tired and hungry and looking forward to my meal. After my first bite I was not happy to find my pattie was very pink. Luckily I had ordered a side and ate that. I tried to call the restaurant many times to let them know how unhappy I was with my burger, but no one answered the phone. I'm not impressed with their 'customer service'.  I thought this 'family' restaurant would be a little more caring and down to earth.",

The onion strings were good but our server Oscar forgot about our sides so we were both half done with our burgers when our sides finally came and only because I reminded him about them and that was after flagging him down!  Overall it's cool you get a souvenir cups as your drink and the burger is really good but poor sides and service means I may not come back or come back only one more time to see if the service got better. Maybe get the burger to go? Lol  $50 for two burgers, two cokes, two sides? Very pricey! But you are paying for the Wahlberg name of course. Big fan so that is why we went and we watch the show.  Interior is great with pics of the brothers with their mother poster of Mark's movies.",

Our server Miguel made up for the disheartening first impression. But the girl with the chopsticks in hair needs a lesson on costumer service. Even when on break you should tell the people you left waiting outside something. Not a fan of a place with poor communication.",

    "text": "Being a local I always call ahead to restaurants especially since I have a family and I want to know how busy it is. We love taking our kids out to new restaurants, but kids in the heat on the strip is really iffy, so you have to choose a restaurant wisely. When we heard that Wahlburgers  was finally open of course we wanted to go down and check it out. They have only been open for 3 days so we called ahead of time and nobody answered the phone, so we just assumed they were busy and that we would just wait and walk around a little bit. Well we get down there 45 minute wait after we just drove 35 minutes to get there. So we're tad bit upset, but there's little shops to go to so it is what it is. The lady at the front who looks so confused by the way tells me to give them my phone number and they'll text me when they're ready. She tells me again it's a 45 minutes wait I don't get a text until an hour and 45 minutes later now at this point I have already gave my kids all their snacks and all 36ozs of water each. So we go inside notice tons of open tablesWe order and wait 25 plus minutes for a kids hamburger, cheese burger sweet potato tots Paul's favorite and the mushroom one with onion strings and fries. The sweet potato tots or disgusting my kids didn't even eat them also my kids hamburgers were burnt my mushroom burger was burnt when I asked for medium and Paul's favorite was crap. What is up with that? This is Las Vegas step it up or step out! Won't be going back and I work in the industry and people always ask me where to go to eat... Wahlburgers isn't on that list! Well on the list to avoid.",

    "text": "We watched the show and we love the family. We saw the restaurant and wanted to support it. We waited 30 minutes. No problem- we played foozeball outside. We got seated and were served by a waitress who seemed annoyed with life. Fine - we all have bad days. The food was awful. Even my kids - 9 and 3 years old - complained about it. Cold bread that looks like it's from a pack that you buy in a \"warehouse\" store. Cold, tasteless meat that tasted pre-cooked. Yuck. Portions are small, and we paid $13-$15 only for each burger. Fries, onion rings, etc. are extra. I had the BBQ Bacon burger. Less than average. Finished in four bites, and I wouldn't have eaten it if I wasn't starving. My husband had what I think was called the \"fiesta\" burger, but I literally can't remember since the only introduction to it (when we asked for something spicy) was when the waitress brought over a napkin holder from another table and held it up to us so we could read the burger's description. Spice level was ok, but again, small and cold. The cheese in both burgers was cold and strangely chunky... Like nacho cheese dip that had sat out too long. We ordered onion rings and fries. They were average at best. I was genuinely sad that it sucked so bad. I'm shocked that it is so packed. I could only imagine it is for the name. Really, I'd be humiliated if my family name was on this restaurant. If the family really cares about the quality of the food and the satisfaction of their customers, they need to regroup. Oh, and our waitress couldn't care less about our disappointment. The only joy we had was when we took photos of the family on the wall and put snapchat filters on them. That was fun.",

I love all of Mark's movies but his brothers food sucks.  I don't want to drag on about the bad, but overall we order 4 different burgers and they all were dry and the cheese wasn't even melted. The tater tots tasted like they bought the frozen ones from the supermarket and used those. The onion rings became very heavy after a few mins. The chili we ordered had a funny taste (Wendy's chili's is better.) Overall service was quite good, however the food is what will be the downfall of this place. If Joe Schmoe opened a restaurant and served this food he'd be closed in a few months, because of the name they may stay open a little longer. Our bill came out to almost $100 for 4 ppl...way overpriced. We could've gone to In n Out and had a burger with fries and drinks 1000x better for 4 ppl for $20. If you want something higher end hit up Shake Shack or In n Out. If you come here you'll feel ripped off.",

When my burger came out it was completely wrong, when I brought it to the expediters attention she was extremely rude and sighed very loudly at me, grabbed the burger out of my hand and threw it to the cooks. Then once again the second time around the burger was wrong AGAIN! Like your job is not hard, you read a ticket and make the burger the way it says... My mothers tots were not sweet potato like she had ordered, the ceasar salad dressing was disgusting...it literally tasted like creamy mayo, no flavor- waste of a $10 salad I just threw it away after all the problems I had with my burger it just wasn't worth going back inside about the salad. The ice machine was broken and employees were looking at their phones and talking instead of offering to get Ice from the back for to go customers- the burger tasted great once we got it but just not worth the hassle it took to get it, wont be back here.",

I'm bummed out because the burgers you promote on your show look amazing. You may want to come here quick and revamp this before it continues to go downhill.

Well I was wrong, you have pay extra if you want fries. I ended up going for the Macaroni & Cheese with bacon, that is an additional $8. The best part was the bacon. The cheese sauce was watery and lacked flavor and left the pasta dry. Cheese is supposed to be creamy and should stick to the pasta. To get the cheese I had to drink it out of the cup. I do not think I will go back, $32 for a burger, macaroni and a beer.",

I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant close to the Bally's casino just beside the Starbucks in the Grand Bazzaar shops. I had driven past before on Las Vegas Blvd, however, what I saw was their kiosk out front. We were greeted immediately by a super friendly host who directed us to the bar for quick seating. (Secret for anyone reading, I always sit at the bar lol) Our bartenders, Michaela and Basil were also friendly and took our order right away. We ordered the Our burger, the bbq bacon burger and tator tots. We also had a strawberry mule and a pint of Guinness. Everything we had was amazing. Our drinks were prompt, our food came out quickly and the service was superb. The bar manager, Paul, stopped by to check on us and really made us feel at home. I loved the way the fresh jalapenos gave the bbq bacon burger a zing. Our tator tots were perfectly crisp and the our burger I should have taken a picture of because I would love to try and recreate that at home. The atmosphere was electric. Great buzz about the place. Constant traffic of people in and out. This is a great addition to the area. Really raises the bar for Bally's and the Grand Bazaar shops. We will certainly be back. There are so many items I want to try. Beyond the great food and service, I see some very exciting shakes and cocktails that I look forward to giving a shot on my next visit. Check this place out for sure.",

Much better tasting, but definitely tiny for $13 a-la-carte burger. And did I mention it came out well-done?   I'm a big fan of the show and respect the Wahlbergs for building a dynasty, but I think Paul would have been disappointed had he been sitting with me.

    "text": "So growing up in the 90s I totally loved new kids on the block specially Donnie Wahlberg so when Wahlburgers opened you know I definitely have to check it out. They were supposed open earlier in Vegas but I guess it got delayed so it finally opened last year and I just got a chance to check it out a couple weeks ago. Watching them on TV got me so excited to try all the food they have there and to see exactly how the restaurant was. so  as I was saying I was totally hyped about getting here. Now my five stars that I listed is strictly for the food and not the customer service that's another story. But first  let's talk about the food. Sweet potato tots definitely a must if you go there I would totally love that I have the Jenny chicken burger which was so delicious I love the thin sliced onion rings they had something different than what you usually see at a burger joint we also had their government cheese sandwich which was also a good mother mixed drinks was OK it was kind of pricey $14 for one drink but oh well it was our first time there so we got that to him again food was excellent I would love to try their mac & cheese when I go back to Vegas again. I so wish they would open one here in Hawaii that would be awesome. I like the layout of the restaurant though from the outside it looked like it was a two-story building but it wasn't. I was very surprised that they didn't sell like their merchandise in the restaurant you actually have to go outside to another chaos and buy all the merchandise. When I've been to brand but it was really cold when we're in Vegas like 30 cold. Now let's talk about the customer service which was horrible and disappointing. Again from watching a show and reading some reviews it seem like it was a great place great atmosphere but our server John only came to our table to set us and to give us our drinks and then we didn't see him again until he came back to the table to give us our bill which I thought was odd. There are other servers that did bring out our food but it wasn't like they're excited to be there anything there was no Like  how's it going how's the food nothing they just drop the food and left and I can understand if it was busy but we were there at like 130 in the morning so it wasn't too busy. No one came to check on us if we needed more water or anything it was just really weird. I noticed that the employees would much rather stand to talk story with each other instead of making sure that the customers were OK. I also did inform John our server that it was our first time there and that we were excited and that we did come only from Hawaii but obviously that didn't make any difference to his level of customer service I was going to give us which is zero. There's anything that could be changed here I would say would be to train the staff better and interacting with customers. Again my five star rating is just strictly on the food and that's it if I had to read the customer service I will probably give them negative stars. But if you're in Vegas and you want to have a good burger definitely check out wall burgers they have a great selection of burgers and also some other dishes and some great makes drinks. I hope our next visit out there is better especially since were flying all the way from Hawaii to experience the wall burgers. And I just like to say that I did journey out to the kiosk outside on the strip and I bought items there to bring back to Hawaii for my friends and the gentleman working in that kiosk Francisco he was awesome he did great customer service gave me a free Blinky cup with some kind of strawberry slush in it once I told him I was from Hawaii and I was like one of their biggest fans like I said excellent customer service I would definitely go back. They need to have more Francisco's working in whalburgers just my opinion.",

Apparently the Wahlberg name justifies a price at least two times greater than quality demands.  I didn't expect a Kobe patty dusted with gold flakes, but I was hoping for something a little more than what I was served.  Blah flavor.  Blah toppings.  The best part of the menu was the FluffahNuttah adult shake.  Next time, I'll just order that as my meal.  The plus side - service was wonderful from initial greetings to final payout and departure.  Friendly, prompt, and attentive.  Step it up, Wahlbergs.  This food needs some serious attention to flavor, quality, and quantity that matches the price point.",

There was so much sauce it turned the bun soggy and the pickles had a fishy taste (so much so I pulled them off) the rest of the burger not a whole lot of flavor.  Put on some mustard hoping to make it better and it helped a little.  The location is fine and again, the service was fine.   They also have a drink stand on the strip and the frozen margarita was actually very good..  as far as the food, I wouldn't go back.  When in the burger mood, I'll stick with in-n-out or fat burger.",

Come to find out, it's because they cancelled his order. No idea why. My Bbq burger sadly didn't have any BBQ sauce on it - womp womp! They took a photo of the table and said they would give us a complimentary postcard...but they put us separately on the postcard instead of the group. WTF?! No thanks. Part of our order was comped, but the manager handled the issues extremely poorly. The onion straws are yummy - eat them if you still choose to go. Water comes in a to go cup, which I love. These reasons, and the fact that my order was actually correct are the reason there are two stars instead of one.",

We had traveled from San Diego waiting to make this one of our priorities while in Vegas but was little short on time. We decided to ask for a seat in the bar while we waited thinking we could have some fries and a shake or a beer while we waited. The gentleman at the door seated us right away and then found out that we could order off the full menu. The server we had was Basile. He was perfect and very polite! He made some great suggestions for us and the service was great! We sat down ordered our food and ate within an hour. When we left the guests that were placing their name on the list before us were still waiting.  I asked Basile to meet the Manager because I wanted to be sure to compliment the staff and exceptional service we received. Her name was Emma. She was extremely kind as well. We were able to keep the green plastic glasses that our drinks were served in. As a matter of fact, Basile swapped them our for new ones. I have some friends that live in Vegas which is why we try to get up there a couple of times a year and I can not wait to get back and share a meal there again. I asked them to let their friends know to check it out because the food was very fresh and cooked exactly how we expected it to taste.  Thank you very much Emma and Basile for the exceptional service and pleasant atmosphere!  We hope to see you again the next time we are up.",

We noticed the Wahlburger sign from our room and I, a burger enthusiast, was excited to be able to try it. We went for lunch/dinner yesterday and both were starving so it should have been easy to please us. I ordered a double-Wahlburger w/ chs and two hotdogs with Ketchup/Mustard/Onion. My fiancee got the seared chicken sandwich. Food didn't take too long to come out, which was the only pleasant part about our venture here. The chicken sandwich, which I had a bite of, had a awkward texture and mouthfeel about it. Almost as if it had a 20%+  water-solution pumped into it. The condiments on the sandwich were decent but he chicken itself just was well below standard. Next, the hot dogs... the worst part of the meal. I eat a lot of food and two dogs and burger is nothing. I only ate one. Bad, over cooked dogs in stale bread - just not worth it at all. The burger was ok. Nothing I would ever crave and was sad because In-N-Out burger was so close by. I'll never be going to a Wahlburger again.",

We  could have gone to McDonald's for $10 and had the same quality.  I was expecting the burgers to resemble something you'd find at a sit down restaurant (i.e. Applebees at least!).  The tater tots seriously looked & tasted like the ones I make at home (i.e. Ore Ida).  They just opened one in Detroit and I may try that one to see if it's any different, but I'm thinking they're all the same.  So bummed!",

Mac n cheese with bacon was the perfect side to the bbq burger which was cooked to perfection. If you have a waiter named Rob, listen to his suggestions. He won't steer you wrong and he was a blast to have as a waiter. Joked around with me and my family and made the whole experience that much better.",

We definitely will be making more trips down to the strip  to eat at Wahlburgers!!!",

There is really nothing not to like about this location. Wahlburgers is in an outdoor food court located in front of Balley's.  This area is worth a visit if you want to save some coin from the casino restaurants.  One surprise for me was that Walhburgers has a good drink and beer selection.  I had a tasty Old Fashioned that was on special.  The burger I ordered was better than average and so were the fries I ordered with it.  My service eating at the bar was exceptional.  I loved all the artwork of movie and TV posters from the Wahlberg's plus the family photos (especially the cutout, see my photo).  I would go back to this location anytime ... or any of the other locations.  I have walked by the one near Fenway many times but never had stopped in.  That will need to change!  CHEERS.",

The chili is super-flavorful and packed with the thickness of ground meat and saaaaauce.   Don't get me wrong, we tried one of the basic burgers, which was nicely presented- almost like a \"fake tv commercial burger\" that looks too good to be True. The burger was okay. I will give major props in the fact that the bun stayed intact throughout and up until my last bite. Nothing grinds my tires like when I am on my second to my last bite on a delicious burger and the burger bun starts falling apart. How rude? Anyone else hates when this happens. The buns served here at Wahlburgers are pretty legit; nice and spongey.   Let's not forget that I also tried the Cobb Salad. Holy shnikey's! This salad can feed four and any of their best friends. This ensalada is HUGE, and very plentiful.  Okay food, so much okay that I'm not running back for seconds when there's a shake shack down the street.",

We sampled fries , tots, sweet tots, and onion rings. NO Favorite.. chowed all of them and left nothing ! YUM YUM YUM! Well there you have it.  One last note.. one of our gals is vegan so she ordered the vegan burger.. it was tasty.. but word to the wise.. she had it with the sauteed sweet onions... it's a must for this particular one so you don't get a dry flavor but more of a sweet savory flavor!

Grind on the burgers was bad, had bad texture and a bad mouth feel. I had the cheesie melt. Cheese was not even melted and burger was luke warm.  So basically two burgers, French fries, onion straws and two free waters came out to $43 bucks. Maybe if it was a good experience would of maybe been worth it.  Plenty of better burger places on the strip. Don't think this one is going to make it. Walk on by.",

I'm sure the location and foot traffic brings in plenty of business. The food is ok but not stellar.",

I reluctantly ordered a Wahlburger salad and it was awful!  What makes a lettuce wrapped burger satisfying when you can not eat bread is that you get the feel for f eating a burger by picking it up and getting all messy with the sauce! As a salad, it's just a salad with tiny chopped up pieces of tomato, pickle and onion and dried pieces of meat cause when you cut up a burgers into small pieces all the juice and flavor runs out!  Every other good burger restaurant lettuce wraps!",

I just realized there is a Los Angeles and West Hollywood location while writing this review. I had my mind set to eat at this place and I wanted to try something other than In N Out, Five Guys, and Shake Shack. I ordered the Our Burger and I believe it was Paul's favorite according to the menu. Just like all those other \"gourmet\" burger joints, this is a $11+ burger that only comes with the burger. All the sides are extra. I sat at the bar since it wasn't too busy and it actually didn't take long for my burger to come in. The only problem was it took a while for a waiter to come around so I can ask for more sauce since the burger was a little bit dry. After getting the sauce, man did that burger taste pretty good. Surprisingly, I finished it within minutes but I really wished it came with some fries or something. This is definitely a place to at least try but I might just stick with my Cheeseburger with grilled onions and some fries with some spread and that comes with a drink. Yep, you know what I'm talking about. It's what a hamburger's all about.",

Hope you're ready for undercooked raw patties because that's what you're going to get. Better eat somewhere else besides this food joint. I'd rather pay for an all you can eat buffet.

However, that's not the biggest hit, because if you order soda that will cost you $4.95 also! So basically a burger, fries, and soda are $20.95. For the money I'd go with in-n-out instead. In-n-out's burgers and fries are probably better for less than half the cost. At these prices the novelty wears off really fast and there is probably nothing worse in this world than a $4.95 fountain soft soda.",

NO one in ahead of us but all the tables were full so they said 5 minutes but we had to wait outside. Normally in Las Vegas that would be ok except when there is a cold front and it raining. Again no one waiting ahead of us so thinking it ok to wait out side - again its 40 degrees windy and raining. Well 20 minutes later we step back in and now the wait to another 30 minutes and we have to wait outside!!!! The check in girl couldn't been any ruder if she had gone to school for it. After being told basically to get out and wait outside we went next door (all 8 of us) and ate.",

Literally right outside Bally's if you are staying there.  They have indoor and patio seating, and it was a nice enough early evening that it was fine to sit outside.  After a review of the menu, I chose Donnie's Favorite, which is the BBQ Bacon burger (minus the jalapenos).  When I got my order, I have to admit that it was a juicy, flavorful burger.  Just the right size for me in terms of portion.  As a side, I ordered the tater tots, since that's what they talk about on the show all the time.  Good tots, but nothing spectacular.  I should have probably adventured to try the sweet potato tots instead.  If you want some souvenir swag, there's a booth closer to the street that sells hats, shirts, etc.  If I was in Vegas longer, I would have considered going to Wahlburgers again!",

We also split some sweet potato tots which were very tasty and didn't taste oily or overly fried. The burgers aren't hue but they're filling so unless you're a eater I recommend splitting a side order. The place is decorated in the same color scheme you see on the TV show. The only two downsides to the location is finding parking and navigating to the place from a nearby casino. It's also Vegas and it's not completely enclosed so the temperature is not as cool as inside a casino.",

    "text": "People. Give it a few months to complain about the service/attentiveness of this new franchise. -  This review will be about the food.  Been here twice. Spent $33 each day. Once on the soft opening on thursday and returned the next day friday.  On thursday order- Ordered 'Our' burger: 1/3lb burger, lettuce, onion, \"goverment\" cheese (white cheese?), paul's signature wahl sauce (tasted like thousand island mixed with another foreign condiment?), housemade pickles.   Thanksgiving day sandwich: fresh ground turkey burger (a 1/4 size of a 1/3lb meat patty. In otherwords- thin), stuffing, mayo, housemade orange-cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash (um, no it wasn't. It was basically mashed butternut squash.)  Yukon french fries,  Malted mint chocolate frappe.  The buns are airy and very squishy. They give their buns a nice char on the grill though. But dull on flavor overall by itself. Frankly its just a bun. Nothing special. Cooked medium well, a smidgeon of pink visible in the first bite.  My thoughts? Its ok. If you have a knack to eat at franchise fast food joints... You may find this burger to be inferior to the likes of in and out or to that of shake shack.  I didn't detect much seasoning to the patty. That's ok, right? You wanted to taste the meat. Cheap. Run of the mill ground meat from the grocer.  Sadly I couldn't identify what the cheese tasted like due to the 'wahl' sauce. If it is a 'goverment' cheese... Well the joke is that it has no flavor and was not exactly an enjoyable food source.  I did finish the patty, some pickles and onions. Discarded the half chewed bun.  Onto the french fries. Modest portion. I found mine to be unsalted or miniscule grains existed on my batch. Since I got this to go, they didn't offer or decide to put in any condiments. O-k. By themselves- not that enjoyable. It being crunchy is the only save these get.  Onwards onto the turkey sandwich. This was actually the better of the order. But!!! Exaggerated exclamations! The most defiling topping in this burger was the 'roasted' (it was mashed) butternut squash. In my mind, If I had to deconstruct this sandwich to relativity: its bread roll, sliced turkey, cran sauce, mashed vegetable, stuffing. Except its a sandwich. But a sandwich on a bun? O-k.  Since the bun is squishy, it simply worked out for the thin patty and its toppings. But, ugh. That squash mash was not enjoyable. Imagine this bland mush with this hint of butternut somewhere in there. It kind of throws off the sandwich. Textures count. Stuffing is standard. No alarms there.  However, even these minute concerns- this was probably the better items you might enjoy there.  The shake leaves little to be desired. Asked to be malted and the server said they would do it, but it didnt taste malty and it certainly wasn't thick like a malt should be. I feel the ice cream product they use doesn't possess a high enough fat count as flavor of itself felt weak and thin. (Thin as in watered. So skim milk thin.)  Without knowing what brand of ice cream they use; definitively it would be hard to say whether it had artificial flavoring for its chocolate/mint. But, to me, it was just generic as it gets. So I'd assume it would be artificial flavorings.  It was soft opening. There are kinks, mishaps, errors that will need to be ironed out. In Las Vegas.. Franchises that come out here don't come packaged with the employees your familiar with either from the state your from or the pseudo celebrity food channel that makes these businesses appear flawless or the memory of an affair you had with said establishment.  Thats setting the expectations to a very low standard. If you work hospitality in this city... I am hoping you have a greater ability of discernable tastes. Or atleast be knowledgable to quality to quantity.  ----  On friday's order:  Ordered Two Grilled banana fluffanutters: peanut butter, fresh banana, fluff (marshmellow) & nutella  Black & white malted shake Coffee malted shake  Thin crispy onion rings.  So.. There was an issue with the fluffanutters. After signing my check and leaving the tip in the cup. About 25 minutes pass by.  Im thinking like.. Ok. None of my items really require this much time in preparation. At some point, the waittress tells me that they didn't make the fluffanutters cause they stopped serving the desserts by 1am.  Hmm. O-k. Didn't respond back with any sarcastic remark or anything. Just frowned and said ok. However! She said she would ask them make new fresh batch. \"Oh! Cool!\" I thought in my mind. \"You just made up for my time almost wasted!\" An additional disgruntled thought processed through.  4 minutes pass by. They just set the shakes down in a togo carrier. (But didnt label which shake was what. ) Along with the box of onion rings and ketchup! (Oddly, not for the french fries for yesterday.. Hah!)  5 minutes pass by. This order was to go. Strangely, they brought out two dine in trays to bar. - yelp says im at my txt review - whatever",

    "text": "My wife and I watch the show. We decided to try out the Vegas Restaurant. 1st off the family values they talk about and quality ARE NOT at this Franchise. From begaining to end it was a horrible experience. My option take your name off the building its an embarresent to your name.  Not too busy for a late 2pm lunch. 30 minutes till a waiter showed up. All the works will completely ignore you as though you don't exist and the moment you order you no longer exist until it's time to pay up. We ordered our food my wife ordered a drink that never showed up during the 45 minute wait for food or the following 30 minutes to get the bill BUT IT SURE DID GET CHARGED THEY DID NOT MISS THAT! Massive fight to get it removed. We were called lists until the bartender looked it up and Nopeshe never got the order. Burgers are great. Only had water since our waiter never got my Dr Pepper or my wife's drink. The extremely disappointing thing that you can watch from the kitchen is all the sides ypu pay $5 eachfor. I would say 20 of each to include the Chile sitting under a heat lamp going stale and cold. That's what you get. Nothing freshly cooked. We tried to complain of the rock hard cold fries and onion slices but the workers MUST be trained  to fully ignore the customer. The family behind us asked at least 10 different workers for water refills for their children. We watched as the workers looked at them and completely ignored them. The father of the group went up and had to get water for his kids himself. At which point the staff suddenly noticed him doing their job. The staff are just plain nasty people to all of us customers.   My suggestion Take cash only. Your not going to feel the need to tip anyone. The service is truly that bad. I would not trust them not to tip themselves. That's the feeling you get from this place. Shady and ripped off. $40 plus for 2 good burgers, 2 old stale cold sides, 2 waters. No manager as far as we could see only one guy who did not at all who we think was the manager.   A suggestion for the business. Don't do your money counting out in the open its sad watching a guy count out his tips cut it in half and keep his half as the guy we guessed was the manager and head waiter split the other half.   Massive disappointment and extremely bad place to eat at. I have to good friends from Boston who go all the time to the original store. They love it. Told them about this place and they were shocked.",

    "text": "Vinny, Eva and Jr. at Wahlburgers in Vegas ROCKED today!  The place was jammed and there were 2 empty seats at the bar. They were friendly and the service was fast. BUT that's not where these amazing people left it. The credit card machine was not working and we didn't have enough cash to check out so we had to wait till it got fixed. These 3 bent over backwards to make our sure extended stay enjoyable. When they did get the credit snafu fixed, they apologized for the inconvenience, which was CLEARLY outta their control, the gave us a discount on the meal and really made our first time at Wahlburgers a much more enjoyable and Memorable experience.  We never get this kind of service and quality in Binghamton, NY. Paulie, Mark and Donnie... these guys knocked it outta the park for us! Thank You All!!   Wess and Karen VanVoorhis Greene, NY",

    "text": "Got here with the family on a Friday night. Was quoted 15 minute wait but was more like 25. Received the text table was ready but a group of 5 was seated before us and they were a walk up. Not a big deal but whatever.   Get seated and it's noisy. Hard to hear the misses who's seated less than 2 feet in front of me. Waiter came up, took drink order. I ordered the Arnold Palmer, please whatever you do watch out, the lemonade is a home brew and very bitter. It made my son made the bitter face. So I  ordered a regular iced tea. It's on ice but, it is butt warm. You'd think you order something that is supposed to be could would be cold not warm. Is the beer cold?   Ordered our food and we had it faster than we were seated. Can someone answer that?   Received our food and it was very good. I think for the price of the single sandwiches things like fries or onion rings should be included.   After our food came we never saw our waiter or our server during our visit.   Overall my / our experience is below average. I know it's  Vegas and it's for the tourists and its, for some a once in a lifetime chance to eat at Wahlburgers I think they should offer a discount of some sort for us Vegas locals.   Life is about choices and we chose to eat here. We will not make the same mistake twice.  As a local we will never return.",

    "text": "I am extremely disappointed in this place. My mom and I were super excited to finally try this place out as she's a huge fan of the show and I like trying new things. We sat at the bar and all of the hostesses and bar staff were great and super accommodating. We got our drinks and then each ordered the \"Our Burger,\" mine well done and my mother's extra extra well done (basically we don't like pink in our burgers). Once we received our food we were astounded with how big they were and asked for a knife to cut them in half to better eat them, but once we both cut into them we both realized neither were anywhere near well done. We talked to the bar staff and they felt bad about it and immediately sent the burgers back to be cooked properly. They even said it was explicitly written on our order of the well done requests. They apologized as it was their fault and that's fine, mistakes happen. But then finally we got our burgers back and what we expected was beyond ridiculous. They took the meat off the burgers and placed them back on the grill and tried to cook them to their version of well done then put them back together with the buns and condiments that we had already cut into. Their female manager on duty (unsure of her name) proceeded to bring back our burgers, that were a hot mess, and never once asked if everything looked alright or anything. She just placed them with an attitude and left. We decided to just deal with it and try the burgers to end up taking a few bites and still encounter a lot of pink so by this time we were done. I asked a hostess for a different manager and she was kind and attentive and said she'd get him to come out. He never did (pretty sure his name was Miguel). He let his bar manager take care of it and didn't make an appearance himself when it had to deal with his kitchen staff and not his bar staff. The bar manager, Vinnie, was great and took the burgers and a round of drinks off our tab but the main manager should have made an appearance to fix the issue instead of it being erased like that. I will never return to this establishment with the treatment we encountered. The only good thing was the bar staff and their drinks, but even that couldn't get me to raise this one star rating because of how awful their main management is.",

Wtf - it's like I'm a mega foodie ok? And you sent me to McDonald's to get the best burger.   $.79 worth.   For $10 this medium cooked burger patty may have been pre cooked-  because it came to my table cold.   Cold.   Ice cold. And the place was not even busy - paul please just call me.    773-398-8417  Alma's Mac salad was ok but would t kill you to add salt pepper and maybe just a little garlic?   The fries were cold and hard and when I asked for some fresh hot ones he came by Lickety split with a fresh batch of cold hard fries in styrofoam cup.    Booooo again boooo I say!!!!!!!  Oh dear walburgers, please come to my backyard and see what really should be on your menu.     Ps writing this made my Midwest heart hurt so so sad.   I wanted it to be sooooo goooood.    Is there anything jenny can do or are we destined for crappy east coast  burgers???",

Because good people will spend a good amount of money at this location and I want people to know what they are paying for.  We waited about 20 minutes to get seated. Which wasn't bad. Once we were seated it took about 15 minutes for a server to even come by. She took our drink order then disappeared. She finally came back after another 15 minutes with our drinks. At that point I made sure she took our order. My husband ordered the Bbq bacon burger w/ tater tots and I ordered The Melt w/ Sweet Potato tater tots. 40 minutes later our food came. (Mind you, at this point we have spent over an hour there)  My food was cold. It wasn't even close to being warm. My husband's was luke warm. I didn't bother to complain because the waitress was too busy talking to another server about her evening. I just asked for the check. We paid about $54.00 for two people. Didn't bother leaving a tip.  Because of the show, I know people will continue to go. And our reviews don't mean anything to them. Which is sad.",

The only down side to it is that we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated but the food is easily worth the wait. Besides, it's a Saturday afternoon on the Las Vegas Strip. Great customer service, friendly attentive crew the onion rings I ordered however aren't regular thick onion rings they were thin sliced which was odd, but still completely filled with flavor. They have great thick cut patties made from angus beef cooked to your desire I highly recommend stopping by here to any burger goer in Vegas I couldn't get the name of the employee who I last spoke to but he really made our day with the lemon key lime pie jar as we were leaving. Will definitely be returning.",

The fries will cost you another $4.95.  I know they are on the Strip but so is In n Out, which is just a short distance north of this location on the same side of the Strip.  At In n Out you can get an awesome burger, fries and a drink for about $7 !!!! And at a great location in The Linq.",

The hostess and our server were both extremely friendly and courteous, no issues there. They also had a woman taking pictures of each table and guests, which you're not obligated to purchase a picture. But they do give you a free postcard picture for visiting, which was a nice keepsake. The cons were the food gave my husband and I an upset stomach (use your imagination). The food was overpriced for being just a regular burger. Its not like the patties are made out of wagyu beef or anything. The drinks were brought to us in a plastic green cup, which was our highlight. Because for that overpriced meal, we took our cups home as souvenirs. For a party of 4 and no alcohol, our bill was $90. We could have went to In-n-Out for half the price and better food.  I'm glad to say that I've checked it off my bucket list and will  not be returning to the restaurant.  Btw we even went to the Wahlburgers kiosk down the walkway, and the server there was also nice and friendly!",

    "text": "There are quite a few places that I know of on the strip that serve the \"impossible burger\" ( lucky penny, umami burger, top golf, Andreas, Cheesecake Factory, etc) but wahlburgers was the closest from the hotel I was staying at. Being vegetarian and a fan of the impossible burger, I was excited to be visiting the restaurant for a third time. The past few times I've dined in and had a wonderful experience but this time I placed an order to go at the counter. Bad idea. I quickly placed my order and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. 15 minutes went by and my order was not ready. Three customers who ordered AFTER me received their orders after I left the counter. Irritated and confused, I went back to the counter to see what was going on with my order. Now 30 minutes have passed, turns out the cashier who helped me (Monique) never put my order in. After speaking with her, I waited right at the counter and watched the cooks make and complete my order in less than 5 minutes! What was the first 10-15 minute wait for? And the additional 15 minutes? Pretty disappointed in the poor customer service. I wasn't even given an apology, I took my food and left. From this experience, I don't recommend ordering anything from the to go counter. You are better off dining in the restaurant, you'll probably have a 10-15 minute wait but at least you'll have a place to sit!",

We came at 11pm so were not that hungry, and we were able to order the smalhburger, which is - as you would expect - a small/kids size burger. A great deal for $7.95 which also comes with a side!  The burger was just 'ok'; nothing that special in my mind.  Between my friends and I, we had 3 different sides - onion rings (more like, fried onion strings), sweet potato taters, and regular tater tots.  All three were pretty luke-warm (maybe it was sitting under the warmer for the while b/c it was late?)  Aside from that, the service was really good.  But with all the other selections on the strip I probably would not come here again.  That said, I still love NKOTB. :)",

Seeing as I was right outside of Bally's, I decided to finally pay my first visit.   Although it was busy inside, I was able to find a spot in the corner of the bar as soon as I walked in. The bartender was quick and attentive, and I was able to place my order quickly. I decided to go with the double decker and some tots, both came out SUPER quickly.   Overall, my burger was extremely enjoyable. I actually prefer it over what I had at Ramsay burger the night before, especially since the price at Wahlburgers was a lot cheaper.   After I have tried every major burger place in Vegas, I'll pay Wahlburgers another visit, especially if we have visitors in town, and they're craving a burger on the strip.",

    "text": "Surprisingly decent food from this chain created by Mark Wahlberg and family. When we got here, the place was mad packed. Surprisingly, the wait wasn't too long. I think we only waited for about 30 mins. For my meal, I decided to order \"Mark's Favorite\" aka the Thanksgiving Day Sandwich. As you can imagine, it's basically a turkey sandwich. But it includes stuffing, house-made cranberry sauce and a few other things in the sandwich. I was expecting the turkey to be dry and stuff, but to my surprise, it was cooked to perfection and it was actually very delicious. My only gripe about it was that it was not as big as a Thanksgiving meal would be, but that's okay. So if you've got a big appetite and you're hungry, I might suggest ordering orders. We also ordered the fries, and they weren't bad either.  All in all, it was a surprisingly good place to eat. It was relatively affordable as well, which is always a plus! Will definitely come back next time I'm in town.",

I ordered the, \"our burger\" & tater tops, the only change I made to my burger was adding jalapenos. The tater tops were nice and crispy but lacked seasoning. In fact, there was like absolutely no seasoning on the tater tops. My burger was a bit bland, however adding the jalapenos definitely added flavor to my burger. Great atmosphere & good customer service. I was a bit disappointed though, therefore only giving it 3 Stars. I would probably not stop by again if I am in Vegas.",

We ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries, a chicken Caesar salad, a Coke, and a miller lite. With tip it ended up being $53 dollars so it's pretty expensive. I looove that you get to keep the green cup your soda comes in! My mother's burger wasn't very visually pleasing but it satisfied her desire for a burger. My salad was good the and chicken was nice and warm. Would I come here again? Probably not. The food is good but not great. The service is awesome, however and the cup is totally worth coming in and just getting a drink. :)",

The manager Julio ended up taking off 20% from the check. So, the food was actually pretty good. I ordered the beast. Bacon bbq burger could use some more sauce. The homemade ranch tasted terrible.

    "text": "Another couple, my wife, and I visited this location on 3/2/17 at approximately 9:30PM.  We chose to sit in the bar.  The bartender rudely asked what we wanted to drink.  We started with just water.    After reviewing the menu, he took my wife and I's order.  He put the order into their system, made a few drinks, and then took and put in the other couples order.  About 20 minutes later, the other couples food arrives.  No big deal.  We assume our food is soon to follow.  10-15 minutes pass and the other couple is practically finished with their food.  My wife quietly asks me, \"Are we going to get our food before they finish theirs?  We ordered first...\". Without prompting, the bartender snidely comments over his shoulder while \"fixing\" a TV (he couldn't be bothered to turn and actually address us), \"it's all in how you order your food?!\".    Well, I'm sorry, but there isn't any world where the difference in cook time between a medium and medium well burger is 20+ minutes.  Hell, simply cooking a burger for 20+ minutes alone is more than well done...  Based on the bartenders reaction and the fact that he did nothing but snap at us, we waited another minute or two and decided to leave.  Keep in mind, we were served nothing but a cup of water in 30+ minutes.  As we're walking out the bartender starts yelling at us that we have to wait for our food to come out.  This affects my wife and I none.  We leave thinking everything is done.  Fast forward an hour or so, the couple we were with knocks on our hotel room door.  After we left, the bartender berated them and constantly questioned them about who we were and how well they knew us.  The bartender made ludicrous accusations including: \"PULLING THE TAPE\" and \"CALLING THE COPS\".  His contention was that we didn't pay our $27 bill.  Upon receiving this information, I immediately called the restaurant and informed them that if they were that hard up for the $27, I'd happily pay for the food.  The manager declined this offer, but never once said the words \"I'm/we're sorry.\"  There was lots of statements akin to \"we're disappointed\" \"I would have handled this differently\" etc.  After a Facebook review, Wahlburgers again said they were \"extremely disappointed this happened.\"  Again, they weren't sorry, despite ruining our evenings.  I posted and private messaged them the requested information (confirmed it was seen in Facebook messenger...), but I have not received any sort of acknowledgement.    To say we were extremely disappointed in this experience is a drastic understatement, and Wahlburgers seems as if they couldn't care less.  Long story short, I can't review the food, but rest assured that you won't receive quality service.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ate here while we were in Vegas and left feeling disappointed and kind of ripped off.  We stopped in to get a snack and saw that the Double Decker was described as \"two 3 ounce burgers\" and understood that to mean that we would get two burgers, each with a three ounce patty, and that we could split that. My boyfriend asked for \"the two 3 ounce burgers\" and we also ordered fries and the bacon mac and cheese.  What we got was two orders of the double decker, and by \"two 3 ounce burgers\" they actually mean two 3 ounce patties so we ended up with twice as much food as we meant to order. When we told our server, he didn't seem to understand the confusion and didn't offer a solution.  Along with what I feel is confusing menu language and a lack of customer service, the mac and cheese was watery and flavorless and the fries were average.  The burgers were actually really tasty but overall we didn't have a good experience here and won't be returning next time we're craving burgers in Vegas.",

The staff seemed to be disorganized they were having interviews at the table next to us and the guy folding whatever seems to be hovering right over our table. He should have done his work else where. I'm a fatty so I'm not a picky eater but I need my meat cooked well done!! They even asked and put a pretty little stick that said \"well done\". I did send back the first burger with hesitation. And the 2nd one was still pink. I give up and just eat the onions rings. They didn't charge us but not what we expected. My husbands burger was good. Maybe by next year they will get it right.",

No Wahlberg sightings, but the food was better than I anticipated after reading some reviews.   My daughter had kids Mac and Cheese which was made with penne noodles bacon and cheddar and I had a few bites and it was delicious. She also had a root beer float which she downed.   I had the thanksgiving turkey burger. It was really delicious but I was disappointed in the size of the burger (think McDonald's size). The stuffing, cranberries and butternut squash was perfect on it. My husband had the triple burger and said it was delicious but also not \"big\" for a triple. We all split sweet potato tots which were awesome.   I had a Fluffanuttah adult milkshake which was really super awesome but really super expensive for the size ($15)  I'd definitely return, but like I said - don't go in starving because you won't leave completely filled, but it will definitely taste good.",

We were quickly acknowledged and sparked up conversation with a guy who appeared to be a bar busser and then our waitress/bartender.   The service was 5 stars but the cooks/kitchen staff can't read the order right (-1 star, forgot my bacon and side of ranch) and the food was cold when we received it (-1 star). Was really surprised that the burger was cold because it didn't take tremendous time to get our food. Another frustrating thing was the machines that blow air between open areas. It was a constant struggle to keep things on the counter when the air was blowing directly at us/the food.    I really wanted a lettuce-wrapped burger but they can't accommodate because their lettuce is shredded.",

To put it lightly, I was not impressed with the Las Vegas location. Service was really bad. Every employee looked unhappy- no smiles, no follow-ups, we even had to flag down three different waitresses just to get some ketchup. Above all the burger \"Thanksgiving\" was just mediocre and the fries tasted old. My burger had less than a  tablespoon of yams and cranberries and the stuffing was falling apart and out of the burger. I could see how it could be potentially a great burger if it were made right. With so much other choices of restaurants to choose from on the strip, I would suggest the Walberg establishment step it up by changing the management at their Las Vegas location as I believe this is probably the root of the problem.",

From celebrity Chef, east coast transplants and west coast staples a burger needs to pretty darn good to make it on the strip. This place will last because of it's celebrity/entertainment popularity but not because of  The quality or overall taste of their food.  Stopped in for a late lunch and there was an hour wait. Luckily two spots opened at the bar so we sat within minutes. We briefly waited to order drinks and the food and it was out in a short period of time. The Beast, two 5oz patties, lettuce, tomato, pulled pork, BBQ sauce pickles and a blue cheese sauce. You would think with all those ingredients it would be flavorful and enjoyable, just the opposite! The burger patties had absolutely no flavoring, how bout a little salt or pepper, just greasy meat taste. The salt found its way to the pulled pork and with abundance. It wasn't very shredded more of a cubed pork, poorly constructed for sure. The only decent flavor was from the blue cheese sauce. With how big the place is you would think they would be better prepared for a crowd of people. One enterance/exit and they have The guests and hostess standing in the doorway, not very organized. I'm sure they will be successful here with all the tourists visiting but I wouldn't waste another minute in this place",

    "text": "I was really excited to eat here but am sorely disappointed. The experience was ho hum. I wasn't going to review the place but when the outrageous bill came I knew I had to.   Drinks Adult Frappes- Fluffanuttahh and Mud Pie (to thick to drink out of their tiny straws and I doubt there is even any alcohol in there)  Food The Melt and a Double Decker (bland, the wahl sauce didn't add anything special and the bun got soggy quickly) Yukon Fries (tasted just like every other restaurant fry) Onion Rings (best thing we ate)  Total cost $72.00!!!!  I could have got a real dinner for that price and it probably would have been memorable.   I was also surprised at the bad restaurant arrangement. You don't realize until you sit down that you can order food from the counter to go and their isn't much sitting room. The room is super loud at 4pm.   Other surprise- the lack of branding and cheap feel of the location. All drinks were served out of plastic and paper cups with no branding. Ketchup was a no-name brand. One wall mural, 1 family picture and a bunch of blank walls where something should be.   Lastly the location is horrible. Behind all the weird little shops that feel like a flea market. I figured it would be open to the city and you're surround by walls. You'd think they have the money to choose a prime spot.   Wasn't the experience I was hoping for and I wouldn't go back.   Don't go unless your just wanting to look around. Your pocketbook will thank you.",

I had the Dad's basic burger 1/3 burger, onions, Paul's signature wahl sauce & housemade pickles with tomato, lettuce and white cheddar cheese and a side of sweet potato tots. Our daughter had the kids mac 'n cheese which they just served cooked pasta topped with a little melted cheese and bacon - it was okay, not enough cheese and the cheese was not mixed together with the pasta unlike traditional baked mac 'n cheese. The burgers, sweet potato tots, mac 'n cheese were just okay - nothing extraordinary.",

    "text": "Ill start by saying, im giving two stars instead of none because I always try a place twice before I write them off. You never know the circumstances for the day... We went on Tuesday night around 930pm. We sat to the left of the hostess stand where there are 6 tables. Two were empty and two were sat the other looked like they were leaving, and us. I like to review places that ive visited honestly and completely.  We sat for 12 minutes when a girl came and said, are you ready to order. Just that. I was already mad that no one said one word to us at all after she sat us.  So we ordered, and to make a long story short, it wasnt a good experience. We waited, and waited then the burgers came, no sides. Burgers were cold for sure. 5 mins later the two sides came but we were just about done. It seemed like they kept changing servers.???...  no one came back over, not once for 22 minutes when the guy took my dish and left the check.  Again, trying to be fair, I did leave 10 tip on 47 bill. It hurt to do that VERY VERY much. The whole time they sat another table, that table ate and left, and I finally waved down the check.  I expected SO much more from them. My son, who thinks im overly critical of everywhere, was so pissed off at the whole experience.  I may go back again to see if that was s fluke or not. The only thing that was hot was the onion rings and we never got the sauce, mayo or a drink refill, which my son usually has a couple.  Im sad by this experience because I feel like Paul would feel terrible with the way the meal went. I cant imagine his quality, for his food, is what we received. I know chefs, doesnt matter how big you are, your food and the reproductions of it, come from the heart and any bad one is like a knife to the heart.  It pains me to give two stars, but if we go back ill revise it, if its better. After last night, its not hard to get better because we started at the very bottom.",

The reason why I put it as a 3 instead of a 2 would be the server...he was cool as hell..however when you paying $20 for a fries and a burger that In N Out still destroys then I'm sorry but this place ain't worth it.  On a side note I don't understand why all these East Coast chains think they can open up a burger spot and charge double even triple of what it would cost for a MEAL at In N Out and still can't live up to the quality.  We had:  BBQ Bacon Burger - Had decent flavor but the quality of everything was on par to something any of the casinos Employee Dining Rooms have with a $13 price tag...  The Melt - Basically a grilled cheese burger in which again they have decent flavor but the quality of the food for that price point was dissapointing.  Yukon Gold Fries - Pretty good but again the quantity for that price is horrible.  All in all I can't reccomend this place because of the pricepoint vs. quality of food. If they lowered their burgers to $6-7 then it mayyyybeee warrants an ok but a $11-15 burger and it doesn't have the same quality as Holstein's...fahget about it....",

If you're a fan of Donnie, Mark, NKOTB, or the reality show (or all of the above), you'll definitely want to stop here. - The menu is full of yummy sounding burgers, apps, sides, shakes, desserts, sandwiches, and more. The burgers all looked and sounded great. - I ordered the sloppy joe and absolutely loved it. Very plentiful portion. And it quite delicious.  The cons: - The service is far from stellar. This is a chain restaurant in a tourist trap location and the servers all know it. - The location sucks. You get so many families and obnoxious tourists (you know, the kind that actually bothers to go to the Bazaar Shops at Bally's).  All in all, I was pleased. As an NKOTB fan, I liked checking out the decor and just experiencing it. And I actually really liked my sloppy joe.",

Hubby got the BBQ bacon burger, it has BBQ sauce, avocado, bacon, lettuce and tomato. Hubby said that he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The tater tots are nothing special. They are definitely crispy!

Located outside Balley's Wahlburger has a togo stand close to the strip sidewalk and a sit down full service bar farther back in front of Balley's.   We went to the sit down full service spot cuz at 106 degrees outside we were seeking shelter from the Vegas heat.  I was expecting a cafeteria style setup but found out it was full service with servers waiting on you and bringing your food to the table.  The menu consisted of sides, salads, burgers and some sammies.  I tried the Sloppy joe which was soft open faced bread covered in a sweet meaty joe sauce and topped with cheese sauce and crispy onion strings.  The joe was delicious and fairly filling at $11.95.  We also had a order of onion strings which were crispy sweet red onion perfection at $4.95.  Wifey had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger  with avocado and jalepeno $12.95.  My wife was underwhelmed by the 1/3 pound burger and probably should have ordered a larger burger.  Soft drinks are $4.95 but come in a hard plastic collectible cup, which makes for a nice free souvenir.  A photo person also comes around and takes a free photo in the hopes of up selling you a souvenir photo.  Overall, I really liked Wahlburgers and will be back to try some more items on the menu.",

No complaints , about the food , only thing $65 for 3 Our burgers , fries,  a Coke,  Soda water and coffee was a little much for me (considering I did not have meat ).   I know it is  the strip , but for locals like us it is kind of a detour , having to pay tourist price .  You get to keep the cups and if you can eat in under and hour , the parking is free.",

Lols I thought the menu is slightly different between the East and West Coast but they still have the Wahlbergs' family favorites ie: Mom's Sloppy Joe, the Our Burger and the single, double and triple burgers. Tried almost each type of the burgers and they're all pretty consistently good! Juicy and tender! I just wish they're a little bigger on the size.  Service for the LV location was excellent! Super friendly and very attentive staff. Being it's a tourists destination, they offers guests to have their picture taken and put it in a souvenir frame. But I think it's a third party that take the pictures since the pictures are not free. But feeling tourist-like, we bought the picture.  Ohhhh, when you're there, do NOT miss their thin crispy onion rings!!! It will be a sin if you don't get this crazy-good thin crispy onion rings! It's not the ordinary onion rings. I think they should be called onion strings instead of rings. They are thinly sliced strings tangled and fried all together in a delicious batter. Did I say you have to get the onion rings?  Hahahaha it's definitely one of major factors why I had to find a Wahlburgers back home. Definitely recommended! Oh, try the onion rings!",

    "text": "I've been to a Wahlburger's once before (in an airport) so I really didn't feel like I've had the full experience, so while in Vegas I decided that I needed a burger for lunch, and it had to be a Wahlburger.  Located in that shopping/dining area outside of Bally's, it was pretty easy to find. It has a nice bar connected to it in front and I imagine, if there was any particular sporting event you'd want to watch, this would be a good place to see it. Me, I just wanted to eat.  My waitress came, was super friendly and we chatted briefly about Drake, which was great, then took my order.  I started with their smoked bacon mac n cheese. Good Lord was this amazing. Penne pasta, smoked bacon, \"government\" cheese (per the menu) a mix of other cheeses, with house made parmesan panko breadcrumbs. I should have just stopped here, because this was really all I needed. So delicious and satisfying, but of course I had more because, why not?  My burger was their O.F.D. which is a  1/2 pound burger, Swiss cheese, bacon, sauteed mushrooms and their tomato jam and a side of tator tots. The burgers come cooked medium unless otherwise asked, which I'm totally okay with a medium burger. The burger was huge. Much bigger than I anticipated even though I knew it was 1/2 pound. I couldn't finish it! It felt slightly undercooked for a medium, but it was still tasty.  The service got a little spotty. Other waitresses kept checking on me, refilling my cup and such. Getting my check was kind of a pain.  Overall things were good here. I'd come back and would recommend Wahlburger's to any burger fan.   Oh, and make sure to snap a picture of you and the Marky Mark cut-out that's there.",

Anyway, I got the Impossible Burger which was the hefty price of $19. It didn't even come with fries... This is a meatless burger, by the way. But I have to take into account that this is a Vegas Strip restaurant, so the prices are going to be a little exaggerated. The food itself was delicious! We also had the fries and onion rings. The onions rings are more like curled onion strings, as they were super duper thin. However, they were all cooked evenly and spiced well, and served in a large portion.   I got a cute, green souvenir cup with my iced tea. It's pretty durable and has lasted many uses later at our house. Wahlburgers is okay for a strip restaurant in my opinion.",

Service was great, the eight of us sat at the bar because we wanted to sit inside and didn't mind and would rather sit at the bar than wait the 30 minutes in the August heat to be sat.

Once we got got there i informed the employee that we wanted to order takeout and he came back very rude and said we dont take out i explained to him that i had just called and they confirmed that they do.  We were very unhappy about this cause we are huge fans of the show and did not get treated well.  I even DM the Wahlbergs on instagram about this.",

We finally got someone to take our drink order which was a soda and a beer, the soda came after 5 mins but had to wait for another five for the beer....which was a canned beer and a thin plastic cup so your beer gets warm fast...so i thought the waitress that took our drink order was going to take our food order but she left and never came back. Finally a new waiter came after waiting 15mins took our order, 2 burgers and a order of onion rings...well we waited for another 30 mins for our food to finally get to us by another waiter. The food was good...the burgers are small but good not the best...dont know if worth the price 45 dollars for 2 burger a side of onion ring a soda and a $5 beer...oh by the way a waiter neer comes back for refills on your soda you have to go get it yourself...so really no need to tip...i might give another try but not first on my list",

Our order arrived and I took a bite and it was like biting into a crisco lard sandwich. I like some grease on my burger like the next guy but the grease was just to much. Then on to the onion rings, if that's what you want to call them,  they are more like broken tree branches fried in oil. The waiter brought the check and noticed I didn't eat the food and offered to talk to the manager, who didn't charge me, and that's what the rating is for as they were great about it but the chef wasted the other 3 part of my star rating.",

The staff was really nice, but I had to wait too long to be seated and it wasn't worth it. I won't be back, but what I will do is go to bobbys burger palace or chef ramsay's burger or burger brassiere or Guy Fieri's so basic any good burger place in vegas. I honestly don't want to be back, but I may give this place another try if someone begs me. It's not that the cold food wasn't okay, but that's all what it was bland and just okay. It's just seems worst because there are way better places near it that serves  burgers right.",

The prices were to be what is expected I guess for the Las Vegas strip, our tab with tip was $52 for 1 double burger to share, with fried onions, fries, Mac n cheese and 2 beers.  We watch the show and thought there would be some heart in the food like the family.  Maybe Paul, Mark and Donnie need to pay this location a visit.",

I got the portobello mushroom sandwich which had melty cheese and MORE sauteed mushrooms on the sandwich. It was phenomenal. My grandmother got the sloppy joe which was open faced, she said it was incredible, and my father got the Wahlburger which was perfectly cooked and he raved about. Server was incredible. They were busy and our food was out in less than 10 minutes, and our drinks were out in less than 5. I've had Taco Bell take longer than Wahlburgers. Nicely done",

I personally think its pricey but for the strip I guess it isn't bad. The Wahl sauce is amazing! Like an upgraded more creamy thousand island. I asked for more and used my fries to put more onto each bite of the burger hahahaha.   The fries were good but it was a small cupful for $4.95. My bf got the Fiesta Burger for like $15 and it wasn't all that special.  We ordered those 3 items and it turned out to be about $31. It is a sit down restaurant surprisingly... I feel like it could work as an order and then pick up restaurant like Shake Shack but I guess they want to make it extra fancy.  I like how there are a few add ons that you can add for free like fresh jalapenos, tomatoes, wahl sauce, and  sriracha mayo. So I got a couple of those on the side.  It seems like a lot of people here like to get those souvenir cups for their beer and soft drinks and there are discounted refills!  Okay burger, nothing amazing or too too different, but worth a try! Expensive for what it is but not for the Strip.",

They don't have vegan cheese for the burger and you need to say no mayo if you want it to be a True vegan burger. Also advise be careful about all the sauce and extras because if you are going to eat a vegan burger. The tater tots wet too crispy. The wait for food to go or sitting down takes a bit. It's a pretty busy place but the burger was good. I think this is a great place to stop if you need a fast food type meal. Just remember you will pay $$ for this meal. Vegas ain't cheap and this place is definitely $$$",

Albeit, it is Vegas; but on the other hand, this IS Las Vegas we're talking about - there are far too many alternative food options to waste your hunger on dribble.   The burger is pedestrian at best, and worth no more than $6; Ol' Marky Marky and his funky burger bunch'll charge you nearly double anyway. There's not enough salt, not enough decadence, and the burger is too dense. This \"government cheese\" motif got carried away with itself, and now your payin' Hollywood prices for \"government meat\" too; do we ever know what's in our burgers? I know what they all say, but who knows?  I'll tell you something though - I don't know how these goofballs did it, but their sweet-potato tots are a stroke of fuckin' genius! Give me a bucket of those, a handgun, and a masters collection of Wahlberg movies, and I'll show you a Saturday night proper!  $15 in on a burger and tots, and immediately I forgot the burger. Those tots will haunt you though. Why didn't I think of that!?! Oh well. They're building one in Kansas City this summer, so I'll keep you updated on whether they're price-gouging Vegas tourists, or if they're in-fact across-the-country delusional. Fat Burger down the street does it better for less money, if that's the sort of thing you're into. In-N-Out's customer service and flavor simplicity decimates Whalburgers - and against Whataburger's flavor and value, it's not even a contender.  Kansas City is already oversaturated with great burger options, so we'll see how quick they shutdown; if they bring that same nonsense I wasted my stomach on in Vegas to KC, It'll be swift and uneventful. I stopped in Alabama for my first Whalburgers, and they told me it would be an hour and a half wait!?! What? Not for a burger. No sir. Freddy's KC makes a spectacular steakburger, Chicago dog, custard shake, and a basket of fries in 5 minutes - In-N-Out does that in half the time. Step up your game, Son.",

Their menu will crack you up, but I won't tell you why so that I won't spoil it. Parking isn't the greatest here so you'll probably have to park at Bally's Hotel guest parking and walk to the restaurant.

Sides were $5 & were not as big as you would think for the price.  Soda is $5.  All drinks are served in disposable looking cups. I can't imagine all the garbage being created.

The sweet potato tater tots came out quick, but they were nice and hot. The burgers took a while to come out, but did come out as ordered( medium for the Double patty burger with Paul's special sauce)  but the sauce was not the greatest I ever have tried, but not a bad burger, it just felt like I could of paid less since it was not so special. Because this is a chain of the original it might be missing something. My friend has the bacon cheese burger and that one was pretty yummy. The place seems more like a good old regular Sports bar and Avril with a lot of Wahlbergs movie posters all around. No bathroom you have to walk outside, and it's more like if you passing by and want that quick burger type of place. At least for this location.",

They pretty much broke apart in my hands. On top of that, the patty was overcooked (and also dry) and the sauce was on the burger. Three strikes with this one. When I told my server their buns were dry, he brought over his manager who said \"that's the way they are supposed to be.\" I wish I was joking. I actually felt belittled! What American doesn't know about burgers and buns?! Well, this one does, and buns are not supposed to flake apart like a poorly crafted sand castle. Gross.",

I had my old review to prove we indeed did eat here. But round two here we go.  We came here during the day and there is a massive wait to dine here so one of us left our number with the hostess so they would text us that a table is open and ready for us while we stroll around nearby. I recommend grabbing some drinks at the Sin City Brewery which is around the corner about 500 feet away.  This time I got the SuperMelt which is pretty much the grilled cheese and a burger combined into one. This would be something I would recommend anyone stopping here to try.  If you're looking for some spiked milkshake, they have a menu for that as well I think you may need to request if they don't give it to you with the regular food menu. I got the Mud Pie which they put vodka, Kahlua, and chocolate liqueur and coffee cream in with vanilla frosting and Oreo cookie pieces. Very satisfying while getting some alcohol into your system.  Overall, this was a better experience and I'm glad I gave it another shot.",

    "text": "If I could leave no stars I would worst experience ever I order 2 impossible burgers so first I was told there would be an up-charge which not a problem but then when they screwed up not once but twice that's an issue. So when I ask why this is on bread and not a bun like the first time it came out I'm told \"oh it's the size of the patty\" but then when you look at the other burger there's no patty really I'm lost! So when I push it aside now I'm like whatever my meal is ruined and the server sends the manager over and his first question is what's wrong with the food? Well the first time it came out it looked amazing but it was wrong and now I guess that because I sent it back and have waited an hour and half still hungry yet to have eaten and it come out looking like someone just slapped everything together because they didn't care and the one burger didn't have barely anything on it there's the problem and I'm not eating the food and came in to eat and he looks at it and is like I see what your saying let me make you another one why so I can sit here for another 30 mins. Yeah I'm good but here's the kicker he doesn't even take the food that I didn't eat off my bill, wait he adds a discount oh did I tell you I still ended up paying for something I didn't eat. Yes that's right I did!!! All I have to say is WOW! The discount didn't even cover the food I didn't eat. Come on as a manager you should just have removed the two burgers I didn't eat and sent me away hungry and angry and I would never had left this review but you didn't you made me pay for something I didn't eat so here is my 2 cents regarding this restaurant! The lesson here is don't make a guest pay for something they didn't EAT!",

When we got to the hostess desk we asked for a four top in a booth since a member of our party has back issues. The hostess outside said ok it would be about 15 min. We were called by the hostess outside while the hostess inside with the purple hair was giving away our table. We could see they were talking and struggling to figure out what to do. When asked if there was a problem the hostess with the purple hair refused to admit she made a mistake and the other hostess asked us to wait inside,  where we were then told by the hostess with the purple hair very rudely to stand out of the way, she finally came around took us to the table, threw the menus on the table and walked away. We then watched her do the same thing to table after table, no greetings, no telling any one your server will be with you, just tossing menus and walking away. I realized it was a Saturday night in Vegas but the music was so loud, we couldn't hear our waiter much less each other. As alway the food was great, just disappointed in the service tonight.",

I had the Our Burger, and it was particularly good with the melty cheese and signature sauce.  It cost a little more for $13, but that's not a bad price for a decent burger on the strip in Vegas.  The french fries were definitely big enough to split between 2 or 3 people, and they were just the right amount of crisp on the outside and soft/hot on the inside.

I actually think the burger is nearly comparable in quality to Shake Shack, which remains my favorite Vegas burger joint. For me, the primary difference is that Wahlburgers features a significantly higher price point. I am convinced you are paying a tax for the Wahlberg name. While I do not consider this to be the top burger joint in Las Vegas, it is a worthy place to grab a bite, particularly if you are in the middle of the Strip and don't wish to trek towards the outskirts.",

Over the weekend, the hubs and I decided to try the famous \"Wahlburgers \", as we were both in need of a meal after walking the strip and day drinking. Upon walking in, we were greeted by a young face and lead to a booth close to the bar. We dove into the extensive menu before deciding on sharing \"The Our Burger\" which was loaded with a 1/3 lb of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, american \"government\" cheese, Paul's signature Wahl sauce with housemade pickles! Ben likes his burgers plain and simple, where I like to make mine all fancy and loaded up with all the fixin's - so opted for onion rings on the side....which were pretty much onion strings! Everything tasted a little blah - and wasn't outstanding by any means The meat was pretty dry and literally was nothing to write home about. Service was decent and pricing wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.  #sorrynotsorry",

I inquired about protein style burgers since I am not supposed to eat bread. I was told that they place the burger on a bed of lettuce instead of wrapping it in lettuce.  I decided to give it a try with a double burger. When it came out it looked like a chopped salad.  This seem too surprised both the bartender and me.  He told me that they usually just put the burger on the lettuce and not chop it up and mix it.  I would have preferred the way it supposed to come. My dining companion ordered a surf and turf darker. It was definitely on the light side with the lobster. The onion rings were indeed thin, as we were told they would be.  They were shoe string onions.  They did comp my \"burger salad\", as it was not what it was supposed to be. That was a good move and the right thing to do. We will be back but I will be much more specific about my order.",

Don't suggest the onion strings, no substance, go for the tots instead. I ordered the double patty burger added grilled onions. Service was great, very helpful! I do recommend if you have greasy burger expectations.",

You have the option to sit outside, at the bar or inside of the resturant.  When we arrived we were offered the outside high rise table, we asked for a table inside, and we were lucky, no wait, seated within one minute. Good timing. We went this past Friday evening, when we left they had a huge line.  We started off and ordered off there WOHLCOCTIONs menu- We ordered 2 Pina Colada's- made with cruzan coconut rum, island oasis pina colada, whipped cream, topped with a fresh pineapple and a pretty flower.  Full of flavor , and perfect amount of liquor ratio to the drink. $10 each From the menu- Husband ordered- double dogs- 2 all beef hot dogs, choose your toppings ( yellow mustard, spicy brown mustard, housemade mustard, ketchup, sriracha, relish, saurakraurt, raw onions) $9.95 I ordered-Marks Favorite \"Thanksgiving Day Sandwich\" freshground seasoned turkey burger, stuffing, mayo, homemade orange-cranberry sauce & roasted butternut squash (I chose to omit the squash) $11.95  We shared a side order of tater tots  Service was excellent, food came out hot, and delicious. Happy we tried Wahlburgers. If your on the strip, I would recommend, they have something for everyone.",

My burger had horseradish aioli, arugula, maple butternut spread, and crispy onions (I asked for no bacon, cheese, or pickled onions).  Customer service was also outstanding.  Highly recommend!

Their special sauce was good but they only put a little bit on each burger, I wouldn't protest them loading it on the bun. The onion strings were really good and enough for two to share. Glad we went so we can say we have been there but not the best burgers.",

Also, this place is ALWAYS crowded during PEAK lunchtime and dinner time. EXPECT a long line with a wait time because of their BUSYNESS. Finding a PARKING spot is HARD and a challenge DURING their PEAK time because of their LOCATION which is right off the STRIP area.

I asked her if this was the bowl, she said yes our BOWLS are really just salads...She then brought out two sides of dressing. It was watery. Way too much lettuce and not enough of anything else. Such a waste.  I paid 12 bucks for literally just lettuce and 3 small chunks of grilled chicken. Our server left midway during the meal and didnt even say she was leaving for the night. I'm not sure if she was sent home or what. The new server that came over was nice but clueless and the damage had been done. My friend had the mac n cheese and said it was like box mac n cheese with bacon bits on top. I've spend 12 bucks in a bunch of bad ways and this is probably one of the worst. 14 with tax.",

I ordered the house burger (med rare) and the haystack style onion rings. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the best tasting burger that I have ever eaten! It was so fresh, and the quality of the meat was beyond anything I expected. There's nothing fancy about it...it was just a very good quality burger with very fresh ingredients. I can't say enough about how good it was! And the onion rings were so thin, crispy, and deliciously flavored with some type of herbs mixed in. At first I was thinking $10.95 for a 1/3 pound burger was a little on the expensive side, but I've had $20+ burgers that aren't even close to the quality as this burger. I highly recommend Wahlburgers, and can't wait to take my wife to try it. I forgot what the beef patty is made from...I do know that it is a mix of ground short rib, and ground chuck and one other type of beef. It melts in your mouth! If you order medium rare...you can expect it to be actually med rare. So, if you don't like it very pink (I do) I would suggest that you order it medium. I love this place and have never been \"wowed\" by a burger like this one. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  Awesome food!",

We had about a 45 minute wait and I received a text when the table was ready. I had the basic burger with Swiss cheese and a side of fries and a soda. I was not disappointed. The burger was great the fries were great. Service was ok, nothing outstanding. Only thing was the prices. Definitely on the high end for a made to order burger. And 4.95 for a rather small portion of fries. Overall though I really liked my meal and it's a place I would return to, just not as frequent because of the prices",

We sat at a table under a big umbrella and sipped our adult beverages from the bar while we waited. They text  the person who's name the party is under when a table is ready.  It was about 40 minutes, but we knew they may have a wait so we  laughed and caught up  with each other while we waited.      The  staff was very friendly, like meeting old friends. They took our orders and got everything right. The atmosphere is homey and fun,  like getting a  picnic table with friends  at a big party.  There are photos of the family everywhere . Lots of homages to each of the Wahlberg brothers and the rest of their family.  I especially enjoyed that they were playing 80s music inside. That was fun!   The food was really good. I am one to enjoy an occasional greasy burger. I love it!  It made the flavor just burst in my mouth. Nothing was dry. It was just right. The cheese was right on time. We each ordered a side so we can taste a little of everything. The chilli was  on point. I loved the onion straws too. I really    I also had an adult smoothie. Get the S'MORES one! It's like the best chocolate milk ever! Smooth, delicious and  you can't taste the liquor.      We took lots of photos and had a really nice time..   It's so good, that I am going again tonight with out of town friends who are visiting. This is going to be the hot spot to meet friends and have fun when they visit!  You can also check out the merchandise store a  short walk away closer to the strip.  T-shirts, mugs, key chains, that sort of thing. I guess I know what everyone's getting this holiday season.    I highly recommend this place.",

From the gatekeeper at the front who can't seem to seat people at tables that are empty once cleaned to the waitstaff who can't get orders right or even ask how you want your burger cooked to the cooks who can't cook a burger right (almost so raw it can't even be called rare when they never asked how you want your burger!!!). There for the soft opening after waiting more than a year and all I can say is that it's not worth returning without a major change... Or closing the doors forever.   This place makes a Chinese fire drill look like a choreographed ballet!!!  Perhaps this place needs to be closed and a Mickey D's put in its place... They at least have their act together!!!!",

Paul's concept of the perfect burger cooked the same way no matter what restaurant you eat at had our hopes way up there. Unfortunately we were highly disappointed. We went on a Monday night at 8 pm. Told it would take 25 mins to get a table. Only took 5 mins. Great. After we sat down it took 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our order. It then took 25 minutes to get our food. Another person not our waitress brought it out  The burgers were cold. We had gotten onion rings and fries also which were also cold so it seemed like the food had sat for awhile. They had gotten my wrong. I ordered an Our burger with no sauce and no pickles with Swiss. It showed up plain with pickles and swiss. I sent it back. They said the ticket was right they just didn't make it right and it would just be a few minutes. The new burger showed up nice at hot and I loved it but my wife and daughter said theirs were cold and it was ok nothing to recommend friends. This is really a shame and a big let down to us. After reading the other reviews I see the cold burgers is a common complaint. I was so hoping Wahlburgers would be the best burgers I ever had. My was since it was fresh but that is only because they messed up the way I ordered it. They have one that opened up in Palo Alto about an 1 hr 30 mins from us but now I don't think it's worth the drive.",

The flavors all melded together wonderfully. Everything on the burger served a purpose. You are not getting your typical thick onions when you order the onion rings. They are very thin stringing onions but again lots of flavor. We parked across the street at the flamingo(free parking) and just walked across the street. You can't actually see the restaurant from Las Vegas Blvd but it was hard to spot once you are in the area. The service was quick and friendly. I'm definitely coming back!",

After much time knowing about the restaurant, I was finally able to try it out while I was in Vegas and it didn't live up to all the hype. The prices are pretty high for the size of the burgers AND the sides. Ordered onions rings as a side and they came out as onion straws (needs to be said or shown clearly). Most expensive shake I've ever had and it was not anything special. Sadly I won't be trying it again :(",

I'm a fan of Paul's work ethic and passion for what he does, my boyfriend and I were going to do a seafood buffet but took a taxi to Ballys instead just to try Wahlburgers.  The staff was amazing, the best service I've yet to receive at a restaurant that didn't cost me 300 bucks.  Sat down and was served waters in a to go cup which was an awesome touch, my boyfriends Guinness was poured perfect, cascading down the cup as we decided what to eat.  Best freaking fries I've ever had!!! Onion rings were the string type which our server came out with two Wahl sauces and forks on his own, prime touch! We got the regular Wahlburger which is Paul's favorite, didn't add a thing to it and stoked we didnt.  I got the Wahlbrewski from a local brewer and loved it.  They come around and ask if you want a picture (free) they come later with no pressure to buy and give you a free postcard to keep.  Not gonna lie it was worth the cab fare and small wait time. I wouldn't take time to write if I didn't feel so passionately about it.  My first yelp review.  It's worth the hype!  Good job guys on pushing your brothers food to the world!  Well done to management for pushing your staff to be the best!!! Please keep it up!!! I'll be back for sure!!!",

I came here with my boyfriend Friday afternoon, and the place wasn't too packed. We had an amazing server, (Taylor? Tyler?) who was impeccable with his attentiveness and politeness. He constantly checked up on us and constantly cleared our table of used napkins and refilled our drinks. The place was well kept and clean as well. Of course Mark Walhberg and his family's portrait was plastered everywhere! I got the fiesta burger and a side of onion rings, and I loved my food! The burger tasted fresh and the onion rings were well seasoned and delicious. My boyfriend has the beast burger with sweet potato tater tots and loved his meal as well. Overall I had an amazing and positive experience here. If I'm ever back on the Strip I'd for sure try to come back here for a good burger.",

Yes I love Mark Wahlburg    They offer seating at the bar which extends outdoors or table seating inside. Too bad it was freezing because it would have been nice to be outside. We were greeted by a really nice bartender. It was her very first day and you could totally tell. She wasnt very knowledgeable with the types of alcohol they served, the menu or how to make a drink (as we could see by the use of her using a drink book). So you might think our service was bad or slow...but it really wasn't. She let us know she was new so I guess inadvertently we subconsciously gave her some slack. Either way, she was extremely nice, attentive and kept us informed with everything going on (at the times things were moving a little slow).   We started with a few drinks then enjoyed the ourburger cooked medium and the sweet potato tots with a side of cheese. The burger was cooked to perfection, I'm not a big burger lover but I gotta admit this was a good burger! The sweet potato tots..yum!!!",

    "text": "I'm a burger fanatic but this joint is just okay. It's loud, crowded and overpriced, and the food is just so/so. When you eat here, you're paying for the novelty of the name and owners. (Now, if they decide to have Mark and Donny start serving burgers shirtless, I may reconsider my star rating)!  I was surprised at how difficult it was to find the restaurant, it's AT Bally's but it's not IN Bally's -- you have to go outside and down several escalators to get there. Once you arrive, expect a wait. The restaurant thankfully has a system where you can give them your cell number and they'll text you when your table is ready. It's nice enough, but there's nothing to do around the area while you wait, just some lame shops and the casino.   While I appreciated the gimmick of \"government cheese,\" I really hate fake cheese so that just grossed me out. I was happy they had Swiss cheese too, but I think it may have been Swiss-flavored processed cheese food.   The fried onions were mediocre (they were red onions too, which meant they were far too pungent for the light batter). I ordered a triple cheeseburger because I was starving, and I'm glad I did because the portion size was really small for the price. My burger was cooked as ordered and well seasoned. The pickle chips were INCREDIBLY delicious, but the chili was the absolute star of the meal. Yes, the chili has beans (boo!), but they are minimal.  It was fun to try once, but I probably won't go back to this place.",

The walk from the Aria was about 0.6 miles but takes like an hour due to the up down left right pedestrian bridges as you can't just walk straight down Las Vegas Boulevard.  Oh well, part of the adventure and a surefire way to exceed your daily step goal.  Since I was alone, I was able to get a spot at the bar.  Placed my order and the drink came quickly but the food was a bit on the slow side.  Definitely built up the anticipation.  When it came, I had to get my pictures then started diving right in.  The cocktail was Hibiscus Boo and it was delicious but a little weak.  The bacon mac and cheese was a little lacking in cheese as others have mentioned.  I just stirred it up as most of the cheese mixture dripped to the bottom and this helped mix up the bread crumbs as I almost choked on my first bite.  Decent but not all that.  I got the Our Burger and it was pretty awesome.  Cooked a perfect medium, juicy and flavorful.  No regrets that I skipped out on tots/onion rings/fries in order to overindulge on the items I did get.  Let me tell you, I recently started a diet and lost about 5 lbs, but it all went down the tubes, I ate every single bite!  It was fun, I'm glad I gave it a try.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I love the show and have been wanting to come to a Wahlburgers since they started the franchise.    My wife and and I decided to get an early start to the day and get in line at about 10:45am since they open at 11am.  At 11 sharp they opened the doors and we were seated immediately.  I ordered a Mud Pie which is something like a mudslide on steroids and my wife went with the spiked lemonade.  Both drinks were delicious.   For the burgers I went with the BBQ burger and the wife did the melt.  We also got some tots.  Despite some negative reviews, the burgers were cooked to order, hot, quick and very delish.  Zero issues with the burgers.  The tots were average and nothing special.  The server was quick, polite and knew the menu items well and could answer all our questions.    So, I was leaning to 5 stars but what's holding me back is the pricing.  Two drinks and burgers were about $75.00 with tip so it's easy to say the food and drinks are \"not cheap\".  For us it was something to experience, but for that price you won't want to eat lunch here daily.    Enjoy!",

It was a nice burger and I will come back to try some of the other varieties to see how they are. American burgers are cooked fairly raw so you have to ask to make sure it's cooked well so no red meat. Good service and was a popular spot.",

    "text": "Our group of four showed up around 7:30pm on a Wednesday and were seated right away. The place was busy, but our order was promptly taken and our food showed up at a reasonable pace. My double burger was cooked perfectly medium and the toppings were fresh. My sweet potato tots were crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle. I tasted my wife's regular tots and her hot dog and it was good as well.  Reading many of these negative reviews, I'm not sure what people are expecting from a celebrity burger place with a simple menu. Maybe they watch the show and feel like the food and service should be amazing because it's built up on tv. I've never seen their show and I thought it ranks somewhere in the In & Out, Shake Shack or Five Guys level of burger joints.",

The first time was because I ordered my burger with no onions and no pickles, and they put onions on it. Second time was when they brought it and it was almost ice cold (they probably left it next to a fridge?) girl was super nice & understanding so she sent it back again. And third was when it made me sick. The double decker has two meat patties and one of them was cooked the other was completely RAW. You can see for yourself in the pictures. Manager or whoever was super nice. Took my burger out of the check and gave us a discount on our whole ticket as well as offered free dessert. The rating is for the food. Before you take a bite, check your burger.",

I know how dealing with customers all day can be draining and you can forget things. No biggie. EXCEPT it was 3 in the afternoon and the waitress had no other tables. There were a few things I let slide. As she was leaving our table with our burger orders, she asked if we wanted any sides. I asked my husband if he wanted fries and he replied \"yes\" while nodding and looking at the waitress. I re-iterated the order and said, \"Fries please.\" She said okay and walked away. Burgers came. No fries. I just assumed she forgot. When she came back around after we completely finished our burgers and wanted to know if we wanted anything else. My husband said, \"oh... I believe we had also ordered some fries as well.\" Totally nice tone, as always. She looks at him and said in a super-snotty tone, \"uh, no you didn't.\"  I believe she saw the shock on our faces and then asked if we wanted to place an order for fries. No, no we didn't. That moment passed when she was rude.",

They said they have to keep us together because they can't do a bunch of separate checks. Ummmm ok I never said we were going to do separate checks. I told them we can just have each table just pay separately.   Mind you I know what you may be thinking. Maybe they were drunk or rowdy. This was at 12pm on a Sunday and I can assure you not one of us had any drinks in us at the time.   In the end we just left and ate around the corner.

After viewing the menu I realized there weren't any turkey burgers served. I wasn't in the mood for a portobello mushroom burger, so I tried the Mac&cheese and an order of fries. It sounded appealing on the menu with multiple cheese's throughout it. And you can't go wrong with French fries. Boyyyyyy I was so wrong. The fries were cold and oily which was disappointing. So, I dove into the Mac& cheese all for it to be completely cold. For it to have four different cheese's in it I couldn't tell at all. I made the waitress aware of my displeasure about my order. She brought me back a different cup of m&c that was drier then the first order. I was done after that as I usually don't send my food back to the kitchen. Paulie was right when he said the quality of the food might suffer if they opened to many chains. $13 bucks for fries and four bites of m&c. Believe me I'll never try another Walburger's unless Donnie Walburger pays for it. Lol He's handsome:-)",

Burger was wonderful.  I prefer the shredded lettuce over a hard slab of lettuce so I was very happy with my burger.  Maybe a bit more sauce but overall I very much enjoyed.
