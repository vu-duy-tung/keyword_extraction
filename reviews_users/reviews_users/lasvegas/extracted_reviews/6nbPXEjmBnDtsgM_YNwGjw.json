Right off the bat we had a hard time just cutting through the patty... right there I knew it was gonna be junk, sure enough. I don't know if it's the hamburger meat they use or the guy that cooked it,  but tasted like sh*t and hard like a rock on top of that. Damn. Also, my wife's plate (hamburger steak and kalbi ribs) they put the gravy all over the ribs too. Anytime you get a mix plate with something with gravy and something without, you supposed to separate them with a piece of foil or wax paper or something, hell, stuff a damn 2x4 in there if you have to! She opens her plate and the ribs are soaked with gravy. People order kalbi for the flavor, like it just came off the grill, but not this one. Ended up being soggy ribs that taste like brown gravy. 2 stars is because they refunded us,I mean... they had to",

It was my first time here but thanks to the many Yelp reviews I already knew I wanted to try the furikake chicken and kalbi ribs.   There was no wait and we were greeted as we walked in. It took about 10 minutes and our order was ready. Just picking up the bag I could tell there was a lot of food in there. When I got home I couldn't  believe the portion size. Definitely enough for lunch the next day and I am not a small eater!   The furikake chicken was really good, cooked well and I liked the flavor of it. The kalbi ribs were hit and miss. The flavor was great with lots of nice crispy pieces. However they were really fatty and quite thick cut. The kalbi I am used to are much thinner. The two scoops of rice and mac salad were also good to complete the mixed plate.   Glad I stopped in to try them out. Would definitely stop in again if in the area.",

    "text": "I would say my favorite Hawaiian restaurant at the moment!  I've been to the Island Flavor out in Durango a few years ago and I liked it then. I've obviously forgotten how good it was, but now very glad that they've opened this one on Eastern!  Kind of dangerous that it's near by LVAC (gym we go to) because it's an easy \"postworkout\" place!  Things we ordered : Loco Moco - Juicy, thick, beef patty over rice, topped with eggs (cooked in your way), drizzled with brown gravy!  Furikake Chicken - The Hawaiian version of orange chicken? Chunky, chicken chunks, fried then tossed in this salty sweet sauce! SO GOOD!  Yakisoba with Teri Chicken - Pan friend noodles with veggies, BBQ pork, eggs, onions, and of course grilled teriyaki chicken! Great comfort food!  Their Mac Salad is also amazing, comes with most of the plates!  BIG PORTIONS, might be a good a idea to share plates!  Island Flavor definitely has that authentic taste in their dishes, service is fast and staff are nice and attentive!  A minus in my part would be the tall tables and one regular table. I'm 4'9'' so it was a little difficult going back and forth from the drink machine to table, also making sure my little one didn't move to much so he wouldn't fall (not kid friendly)!  Other than that, definitely a favorite!",

Nevertheless, my mom usually gets different salads to try them all and is always dissatisfied with them. Overall still pretty great! Just don't get the salads!",

We both got combo plate with furikake chicken and teri beef (came with mac salad and rice). Let me just say that the portions are HUGE! We could have easily shared one combo since we both took more than half home!  We also ordered half pound of hawaiian style poke and it was so good and so fresh! The flavors were seriously amazing, we could not stop eating. I would be honestly come just for the poke! The seating area is small, so if it is busy I can't imagine there being much seating. My only negative is that it was fat the most expensive hawaiian food I've had out, but with the super huge portions and delicious flavor.. definitely worth it! I like to support small establishments like this because they truly work hard and take pride in what they do. Aside from the great food and friendly staff, I was digging the island tunes.   I will definitely be back here again. I just hope they make another location some where northwest!",

    "text": "I expected a really mindblowing experience after all the hype around the original location and the positive comparisons drawn between the two, but the Eastern outpost of this restaurant lands merely in the \"really good\" category.  Island Flavor Express is in the Regal Colonnade plaza on Eastern and Pebble, and it's very clearly a Hawaiian restaurant given all the depictions of the islands, reggae/ska music, and typical plate lunch menu options. They also offer varying specials and some desserts, although the desserts seemed to have run out in the waning evening hours. The decor is very simple but doesn't detract from the experience. Make sure to walk to the far end of the counter to place an order, but feel free to sit down if you're not taking it to-go. They'll bring the food out to your counter (or table, if you've picked the one table).  I ordered the mixed plate ($11.25) with Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Short Ribs (+$1.00 for this particular meat). It's presented in a foam to-go box even if you're dining in. My favorite part was actually the macaroni salad, which was salted in a good way, and as creamy as you'd expect. The chicken was kinda like the \"KFC\" at Gen Korean BBQ in a not-so-good way. It has more of a dry, stringy texture than a moist, natural chicken texture, and the furikake didn't stand out as much as the sweet glaze did. Sriracha saved the day though, bestowing a little extra sweetness along with much-needed acidity and heat. I don't like having to add a condiment to make something stand out, but I'm very glad that I had the option.  As for the other parts of the dish, the white rice is cooked perfectly, and the kalbi is a great rendition with tender beef, a nice touch of ginger, and some charring. It's a little on the fatty side, but let's remember that fat = flavor, which was proven in this case. Actually, it has muted sweetness when you eat it after something as sweet as the Furikake Chicken, but I was able to taste the full flavor when I dove into my my leftovers. If I get a mixed plate again with kalbi, I'll probably have to go for something like a pork dish that's not so sweet.  My friend shared a spam musubi ($2) with me. It was a nice-sized portion, but the rice ratio was a bit high for me. Also, the seaweed was a little too mushy, which my friend pointed out may be a side-effect of the heat lamp. Although there are interesting seasonings and herbs in Island Flavor's version, I prefer the Ross J's rendition, which I'm sure is prepped to order.  I also tried my friend's oxtail soup ($10), which actually comes in a real bowl if you're dining in. Unfortunately, I can't compare it to the renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup at that one hotel downtown (because I've yet to try it), but this version tasted well-seasoned and meaty. The vegetables are a welcome sight, but watch out for the not-so-edible ginger and the inedible bay leaf. I'd consider ordering it again, especially now that we're getting soup weather daily, although I might have to make it a to-go order or otherwise bring my own soup spoon to avoid dealing with the inadequate plastic spoons.  Given that the food here is reportedly much the same as OG Island Flavor, I wasn't quite as impressed as I'd hoped. I certainly enjoyed having plenty of leftovers with the huge portions, and I'll definitely come back to try their other proteins and specials (pork chops w/ mushrooms and onions, anyone?), but I expected to experience something \"sublime\" other than the music. Maybe I'll find it in the future.",

And nibbling on the bones is usually my favorite part about short ribs. I couldn't do it with these because I refuse to eat pure fat.  Furikake chicken: the majority of the serving was the crumbs/breading. There were only a few big pieces of chicken.   Korean short ribs: mushy and all breading.   Don't get me wrong, the flavoring of the short ribs and furikake chicken were good, but the execution was a huge disappointment. Sometimes trying new places isn't always a good thing.",

    "text": "I'm in love with the saturation of Hawaiian restaurants in the Las Vegas area (of which the East coast surely misses out on) and another welcome addition is Island Flavor.  The prices are slightly higher than some of its competitors but the quantity and good flavor surely makes up for that.  There are quite a few options of fresh ahi tuna poke here.  I ordered 1/2 a pound of Hawaiian style poke.  The cuts of tuna they used were very large and quite fresh.  It was marinated in a soy and chili flake sauce with some minced onions thrown in the mix.  Pretty good option for poke in my area.  The mixed plate we ordered was fairly good as well.  Furikake chicken was spot on, kind of like crispy orange chicken but with more flavor from the furikake seasoning.  The kalbi short ribs ($1.00 more) were good and came as 2 huge pieces of meat.   There's quite a bit of fat on edges which I did not eat and one of our meats came out a little more red on the inside than my wife likes to eat.  Luckily, I have no problem with that.  I've glanced over some of the breakfast options and saw the Portuguese sausage and eggs at over $8.    That's $3 more than I'm used to for a standard breakfast option.  I decided to get a side of the Portuguese sausage but they were considerably smaller and not as good as my go to spot for Portuguese sausage (Aloha Kitchen next to UNLV for those wondering-amazing).  For the closest location with good poke and friendly service, I'll definitely keep Island Flavor in mind.  Truly a good mixed plate with plenty of left overs for a second meal.",

Tonight, we waited nearly thirty minutes as our order sat on the counter and they forgot about the furikake chicken which was sitting out in the sauce, getting cold.  They just kept pushing it to the side, serving the customers who came in long after us, and didn't even think about our food until I asked them specifically about it.

After striking out at two other nearby locations with great reviews (closed cause it was Black Friday) we tried Island Flavor. It was smaller than I had imagined, one unit in a small strip mall. There were maybe 6 small tables along the wall, but people were filing in and out at a steady pace. Very busy, but that could have been due to it being Black Friday and many other restaurants were closed. I ordered the miso ahi steaks, perfectly cooked with a tasty sauce and rice, my wife got teriyaki chicken, also very good. The staff was friendly and even attentive, unexpected, considering it was more of a fast food atmosphere. Both meals together cost about $20. Accommodations could have been more friendly/inviting if they had a bigger location, but I think they cater more to take out. If  you're not a fan of the hustle & bustle, get it to go, it's worth it. Very Good food",

Bruce and Maili no longer are the owners of this business and now its owned by Viaggio-Vita-llc, a haole owned company.  Not knocking the new owners but the food quality has gone down and the taste is no longer the same.  A lot of the old time workers are no longer here and the Hawaiian music is gone, maybe forever.   A lot of new young servers are now working here which is good because they still bring the Hawaiian Mana.  Sad to say but because of changes in taste and quality of the food don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon.  Need to find another good Hawaiian restaurant again. Even the fast food outlet on Eastern was sold to the same guys that bought the original store.  SAD.  Good luck to Bruce and Maili and thanks for the wonderful years of dining experience.. Aloha oe.  One thing I've noticed is the new cooks working here.  I don't think they have the experience of Island cooking at all and our order was totally screwed.  Grand daughters spam rice came really late, and our poke didn't show up till we asked what happened.  Heard the cooks telling the servers not to ask for the food because they were backed up on orders, never seen or heard that before.  Wow what a disgraceful action from the kitchen.  Korean chicken tasted funny, Kalbi tasted over cooked, Katsu chicken came out a bit burnt and slightly hard, ummm what is going on here?   Well, good luck to all who visit, and hopefully things will change for the better.",

My son is into short ribs right now so we got the kalbi as the second meat. Amazing. You get the meat options, fried rice, a little cabbage at the bottom, and their side of delicious Mac salad! The coworkers and I always hit up the Durango location, this one is identical. Other dishes I've tried are the chicken Katsu loco mojo and poke. When that gravy mixes with steamed rice something magical happens . Seriously go try it. Ask for some sriracha on the side and enjoy!",

This location is east of the strip and it's considered \"express.\"  I guess their menu isn't as extensive as the other location on the west side of the strip.  Parking was easy to find; they have a small lot in front of the restaurant.  They also have restrooms in the back and condiments/utensils in the front by the sodas.    The menu is on the wall in front of the kitchen.  I ordered a combo of kalbi and furikaki chicken.  I wanted to try the pork, but maybe on a next visit.  The combo came with a side of macaroni salad, and I opted for white rice instead of brown rice.  Both meats were delicious.  Furikaki chicken is something I've never heard of before, and I love furikaki!  It's a bit on the sweet side, so I recommend getting it in the combo.    I'll definitely be back next time - maybe to try the poke, too!",

My food of choice was the mix plate with kalbi and furikake chicken. It comes with 2 scoops of rice and a side of mac salad so it's plenty of food! Everything was so tasty and I think I'm in love with the furikake chicken. Seriously order this if you're visiting this place! Will definitely keep this on my lunch list for work.",

The batter has a good crunch despite the glaze and it's an addictive dish.  Knowing it's deep fried, I tend to shy away from these types of food, but I can never come to Island Flavor and not order this dish.    The pulehu ribs has a dry rub versus the kalbi ribs more of a saucy seasoning are both salted heavy.  I always have to order my dish light on the sauce and the chef is more than happy to obliged.  I get an option to have brown rice instead of white rice, and then I replace my mac salad with sauteed vegetables.  This place offers a good medium for me.  Even though I'm having a cheat meal, I still get a dose of my healthier options.    The kalua pig is smokey, light on the salt, and you can't go wrong with shredded pork.   This is a definite must try if you're craving Hawaiian flavors for plate lunch style.  It's on top of my list of restaurant to eat while in the city of Henderson.  I'm hooked and have cravings that knows no bounds.     They close early on Sundays at 4p.m., so don't come late and disappoint yourself, like many before.",

A local stop that myself and my girlfriend (who is from Hawai'i) will constantly visit when we're in the area if we wanted taste a piece of her motherland.  We ordered their Shoyu Poke and their Furikake Chicken during this visit.  First off, the poke and the way it's cut is definitely how traditional poke should be. It was seasoned really well, close to perfection, however, this time around the seasoning was a little bit more salty than what I remembered. Still better than any poke place in California that claims to have traditional Hawaiian poke (besides North Shore, which is really close to traditional), however, as I said, it was a little bit too salty this time around. Next, is the Furikake Chicken, which is definitely something myself and my girlfriend every single time we visit Las Vegas. The crispiness of the chicken was really good, and it seemed this time they added more sauce, which I absolutely loved! For me it was very flavorful, and mixed with the warm rice they served along with it gave it a nice balance of heat and flavors in my mouth. A good balance of sweet and salty.",

The place itself has a decent amount of seating but would not recommend this place for large groups, probably for parties of 4 or less. Now onto the food:  Mixed Plate (Kalbi and Furikake Chicken) - would definitely recommend sharing this. You get a choice of rice, brown rice (no extra charge), or fries. You also get a choice of macaroni salad or salad. The furikake chicken was sooooo good and the seasoning was on point! The kalbi was a bit chewy and not all the pieces were flavored well so I would recommend trying something else. Macaroni salad was decent. I just wish they had more sauces to eat with the rice.",

This is their quickie express version with counter service and a few tables.   First things first: haupia cake. It's perfect in texture, and the haupia flavor is subtle and beautiful. I ate dessert while waiting a few minutes for my plate lunch. (The cream on it isn't particularly special, but the rest of the cake is PERFECT.)   Next: unless you are Michael Phelps or the god Maui out of the movie Moana, these meals are filling enough for two people to share. Holy hell, there's so much fatty, delicious food that it's surely grave to your health on a regular basis. It's all good quality and done with great flavors. They are on the sweet side, but my favorites are the furikake chicken and short ribs.   Like Durango's location, the service here is so unbelievably kind that you can't help but wish the whole world could live life like that everyday. (To the lady working today, THANK YOU. So much aloha in your heart that the world must be a better place because you are in it!)   They have daily specials posted on the wall when you walk in and everything legit Hawaiian on the menu, including all those glorious Pacific Rim fusion meals.   I'm at McCarran waiting to go home and packed my leftovers in a Tupperware. I even had to tell the TSA guy to eat here when he did a bag check for me.

Definitely gonna take that hike out there again soon. Delicious. Also, most importantly, not pricy at all.",

I had the famous mixed plate with Kalbi Ribs & furikaki Chicken. Huge mouth watering portions. It took me 2 days to finish the combo plate. Also, you know when a Hawaiian food joint by the mac salad. It was so DELICIOUS!  Customer service was excellent. I felt I was served by a family member who really wanted me to enjoy my food experience.

I like the fact that they cook to order so the food is hot and fresh. I ordered the mix plate of Kalbi short ribs and furikake chicken. The Kalbi short ribs were tender and flavorful, but some of the ribs were more fat than meat. The furikake chicken are pieces of chicken deep fried in a sweet and savory sauce which was pretty tender and tasty. They also sell masubi, which are sushi rolled Spam. They masubi was really big, but since I ordered a lot of food I decided to try it next time. They were also selling a chantilly guava with huapia cake, which I asked about and the person said it was like a chocolate cake with a yellow something, they personally haven't tried it, but the worker said people like it. May I'll try it next time. Also,  I opted for sauteed veggies instead of the macoroni salad for my first try here. Unfortunately, the sauteed veggie butter sauce ended up leaking all over the bag inside. The rest of the food held up fine though. Food was good and service was friendly. Will give this place another try, but will double bag to-go orders just in case.",

And I'm pretty sure the rotation stops here. Look no further for fresh, traditional, island favorites, with fantastic friendly service. We really felt like ohana tonight.   Kalbi is so tender and succulent, Furikake Chicken is more flavorful than any I've ever had on the mainland, and the Teryaki Chicken... Well let's just say the kids ate almost a whole plate to themselves, and they're damn picky! Hubby says their mac salad rivals mine, and that's saying a lot (and I may have to agree). (Food was too good, no pictures this time!)  Complete with Pass-O-Guava and Lilikoi Hawaiian Suns, this meal was so worth every penny (just bummed we passed on the Haupia cake that we had last time... Next time for sure cause that stuff is like legal crack), I'm positive we will be frequent offenders here!  And bonus thank you to the awesome \"Auntie\" for the extra musubis! Kids are so stoked!!! You guys are now their favorite, and ours as well!",

We got an order of poke, one order of fried poke, and a order of the Kahlua pork. All of it was incredible. I'd tell you what flavors of each we got, but we let the cashier pick whatever she recommended, so I can't remember). Poke was fresh, tasty, and plentiful in each of our half orders and the kahlua pork looked unseasoned, but the taste was perfection. They need to expand asap, but definitely worth your time (even like us, driving from the strip).",

Not much difference in the food for the most part pretty consistent BIG portions and solid local food. I believe the menu at Express is half the size? Not like the menu at Durango location that more like book open up couple pages here just one page action. The dishes on the menu here seem to be the popular items or for me the local food enjoy the most! They run daily different specials so might want call in see if you tried the whole menu or want something else. I came to get dinner on the way home from KONA viewing party. I got steered from the one and only Shirley B get me some Furikake Chicken. Winnah! For the most part most of the pieces was good size although have to admit or agree with Marie T some of it was more deep fried crumbs. The portion size is so big but really good at same time. The sauce really enjoyed! They do put lot of sauce but then again everything here is huge including the sauce. I literally had half my two scoops of rice soaked in it. In good way.  I got some Poke action. I got the Hawaiian Style Poke Half Order. It was good. The quality of the tuna was solid, the sauce was ok, and best part was the limu. It been long time since had some. It adds so much flavor to any Poke. Good. I feel down the road Poke Express is much better and they have better selection. I would still order the Poke again if needed get my fix in.  Overall definitely place would stop by again!",

My hamburger steak was so hard, therefore, it was obviously over cooked.  In all my life (66 years) eating loco moco back home in Hawaii or here at many places over the last 21 years in Las Vegas, I've never had a tough, overcooked hamburger steak. Hope it was just a one time thing. It was probably because they were busy: I called about 8 times which no one picked up on any of the calls.  I ended up calling the other location to check if the Express restaurant had closed down. The other location told me they already had several of the same phone calls since no one was picking up in Henderson.  Finally, I went there to order in person. Either way, it really shouldn't be an excuse for an overcooked hamburger steak because I spent over $100. on 5 meals plus a bunch of side dishes. However, I'll give them another shot and see what their specials are like i.e., sweet sour spareribs on Wednesdays.",

A bit sweet bit I like it sweet.   Thier oxtail soup was great! Though I think by the time I got to try it, it was a bit salty. A friend of mine went there earlier that day and said it was good but maybe that's cuz he went there right when they opened so it wasn't too salty yet. But it was real tender.   I advise everyone to try this place out. Thier food is not only good, but they also give you big portions.",

It's probably because when I get my food I eat it so fast I forget to take pictures.   This is the second of 2 locations. The other location is the larger restaurant with a full menu. This location is the smaller one with a condensed menu of some of the local favorites. Each day they have a list of specials that help expand their menu options. They also have a cooler with Hawaiian sun juices and some local desserts to complete your meal.   Today we got the kalua pig with no cabbage, 1/2 order of ahi poke with avocado and mixed plate with teriyaki chicken and hamburger steak.   Kalua pig comes with 2 scoops rice and Mac salad which taste great. They use corse ground pepper which makes it have a more peppery taste but I like it. The kalua pig is good. Not to salty, not to smoky, juuuuust right.   The ahi poke is good and one of my wife's favorites. It has just enough sauce without drowning out the flavor of the fish.   The mixed plate was great. It also comes with Mac salad and 2 scoops of rice. This is the first time I've had their Teri chicken and I must say that it was sooooo good. The marinade is on point and the grilled flavor kicks it up a notch. I will for sure order that again on its own. The hamburger steak was good. They have one of the best gravy around.

This restaurant is located in a small plaza on Eastern and Pebble just across from the gas station.

I do both dine-in and takeout and they serve their food out just on time when you think about how big of a size & quality that they're giving.  Their cashiers are very courteous and professional. And I love that good-vibe type of feel when you enter and leave the front door.   Just a side note for those unaware of the changes, they have slightly increase some of their menu items and they have a note posted on their front store. Other than this slight downfall, they still continue to serve delicious food that me, my family, and friends crave for!   When it comes to Hawaiian food overall, you can't beat this 'diamond in the rough' type of restaurant.",

If you're in the area, definitely stop by. There aren't a lot of tables for large groups but it was perfect for us for lunch. Their portions are pretty huge, kind of like 2 meals in one so be prepared for leftovers!   Even the lunch specials are so big that we could have shared! Definitely worth it.   P.s. Their Mac salad is",

    "text": "Island flavor is by far the best Hawaiian food that you can find in Las Vegas Nevada. This trip I ordered the Furikake chicken, the macaroni salad, the white rice, brown rice, the sliced pork with gravy, the pork Adobo and the teriyaki chicken!   The FURIKAKE chicken was insane! It was literally the best chicken dish that I have had of the sort. They somehow managed to tackle having crispy edges on their succulent moist chicken pieces. The chicken is sauteed in their sauce that can only be likened to A General Tsaos chicken minus the peppers with a little FURIKAKE seasoning. This sauce is a perfect balance of savory, citrus, honey glazed goodness!   The Mac salad was extremely fresh and well put together. I definitely enjoyed it as well.  Unfortunately, the sliced pork with gravy I received was slightly overcooked to the point where I couldn't really enjoy it. However with that being said, the pork and the gravy went together extremely well and I could tell  had this dish not been over cooked it would've been one of my favorites as well.  We really enjoyed the pork adobo as well. We ate a small portion of it. Then save the rest to put on top of salads!   The only thing that I can say that is non-positive is that the brown rice was extremely overcooked to the point where it was mushy and not edible.",

During my latest visit, I ordered online and picked up my order. When I got home and opened the box, it already looked different. The shrimp was fried, but the sauce was on the side. The sauce was also not the sauce I was used to; it was just sweet chili sauce, like the one you eat with egg rolls. Not a fan. The steak was a cut I wasn't sure that I've had before. Either that, or it was just extremely overcooked sirloin.   To top it off, the amount that was listed during my online order and the amount I was charged at the restaurant was different! It was actually $2 more, and I didn't notice until way after. I read on here that there was an ownership change recently. The entire encounter was just very disappointing.",

The sauce was put on after cooking and not caramelized at all.   The short ribs were delicious   They had different sugary canned drinks from Hawaii. Nice option over soda.   Great service.

    "text": "I am so behind the curve when it comes to dining spots east of the 15. Even my long time Yelp buddy Rod from Hawaii knows about this place, dine here with his poker buds and written a review nearly a year ago.  Sad face!!!  So, I spent a good chunk of today on Yelp researching for places to eat, those that may offer lunch or dinner or daily specials, as well as those that are closed on Mondays. Yeah, I am not afraid to admit I research potential places I might eat at the way some people research and plan their European vacation. But with the WiFi sporadically cutting in and out, which the Cox technician blames on the 2 year old Netgear router, this impromptu query took longer than expected. By the time I narrowed down my list and picked a spot I was already very hungry and is way past the time for a Hobbit's second lunch.  Luckily, Island Flavor Express was just a few minutes drive on surface street without too much traffic.  Finding a parking space was also not that difficult, although I did have to drive to the side of the building to locate a vacant parking spot that is not designated as short term 30 minutes parking.  Upon walking in, I saw their Today's Special and after a quick glance I opted to ordered their Kimchi Fried Rice with Korean Chicken Wings, instead of the Furikake Chicken that helped secured my decision to come here today in the first place.  Yeah, when it comes to food I am fickle like that.  None of that boring 60's diner conversation that either starts or ends with \"have the usual\" for me.  So after a few minutes the lady that took my order dropped off a to go box filled with my Kimchi Fried Rice surrounded my a mob of Korean Chicken Wings (the container was closed). Even without picking it up, I can tell/edumaguess that it was going to be substantial from the soft thud that it made when it made contact with the surface of the table. But I could totally have hallucinated it as a result of the low blood sugar level.  But picking it up only confirmed my 6th sense was not off at all.  How about that :)  The Kimchi Fried Rice also contains pieces of chasu, not just kimchi as one would suspect. It is decent, not the best I've had, but the portion is definitely on the high end of the spectrum for serving size.  The Korean Chicken Wings are cooked nicely, but is not sticky like the ones served at Korean Fried Chicken spots around town. But after awhile the whole meal elevates your sodium level, and as much as I love Hawaiian Sun products with Island grub, a single can is not enough. So plan ahead, buy 2 cans at $1.25 each or get soda from the fountain or water.  I'd totally be back again, hopefully for the Furikake Chicken, in the not too distant future.  Price: 4-5/5. very reasonable for the portions you get.  Parking: 4-5/5. plenty, just might have to walk a bit if the spaces directly out front are not available.  Tastes: 4/5. Nothing fancy, but pretty good and worth coming back for more.",

I was a little disappointed that they ran out of avocado for the day but they still offered it, and I had to pay full price for it without the avocado.  However, the poke itself was pretty good. You could tell it was fresh and the quality was excellent. I got the combo so it came with a Mac salad and rice. I love Mac salad but didn't enjoy theirs as much. There was a strong pepper taste. The place is pretty small, so if it's busy there may not be seats. The price was decent. Would probably come back when I'm craving poke and in the area again.",

I tried a Mixed Plate of Kalbi Ribs and Chicken Katsu and my boyfriend had the Furikake Chicken. The portions are hugeee! The plate comes with 2 scoops of rice and a side of maraconi salad.   They gave me 6 Kalbi ribs for a mixed order which is great but the ribs themselves were very  thick, chewy and fatty ): I didn't like eating them too much. The Chicken Katsu was disappointing too since it wasn't very crispy. My boyfriend scored with his order though. The Furikake Chicken was seasoned perfectly and really does taste like furikake! The chicken was crispy and tender; I would definitely recommend this dish. The macaroni salad was delicious and one of our favorites as well.  I would give this place 3.5 stars, so a 4 rounding up. Although I was disappointed with the Kalbi and Chicken Katsu, the awesomeness of the Furikake Chicken made up for it. I recommend skipping the Kalbi and Katsu and trying something different!",

This is like a zippys to me. Just mediocre. Spam musabi had no furikake, it's  literally just nori, rice and spam. Even the 711 spam musabis are better than this! Even my homemade one is better lol. Furikake ckn didn't taste like furikake ckn it tasted like garlic ckn with a dash of furikake and SUPERRR salty. Forgot what I got before that but I guess it goes to show you how spectacular I think this place is. Oh I also tried the guava cake. Worst cake ever. Taste nothing like guava and actually ruined the taste I had in my head of the good guava and chiffon cakes back home. Maybe you guys been away from the island too long that you forgot what REAL hawaii food taste like. Sadly they are supposedly from Hawaii too. Your best bet for hawaiian/hawaii food is cinnamons!",

She showed us the specials and asked if we had any questions as we reviewed the menu, but she didn't rush us.   The inside of the restaurant only has about five tables, but is clean and organized. I definitely felt comfortable dining inside the restaurant.   I had the Mixed Plate with Kalbi Short Ribs & Furikake Shrimp. The Kalbi Short Ribs had great flavor, plenty of meat, and most pieces had more meat than fat. The slight char on each rib was perfect. The Furikake Shrimp had a the perfect amount of breading and the seasoning on the breading had a nice flavor. The white rice  was simple, but well prepared. The macaroni salad was so good! I loved the black pepper taste and the dressing on the macaroni.   My husband also had a Mixed Plate, but with Chicken Katsu and Kalua Pig & Cabbage. The Chicken Katsu was very tasty with tender chicken and the breading was tasty. The Kalua Pig & Cabbage also had great flavor with tender meat.  Of course I couldn't pass on a piece of Guava cake to take home. Guava is such an underused fruit and I love the guava in this cake. The cake has great flavor and is very moist.   Both meals had very generous portions of both meat and sides. I see why meals are served in to go containers after seeing the portions. We definitely had a decent amount of leftovers. I like that plastic bags are out to help with taking leftovers home. Prices are reasonable given the portions and quality.",

Island Grill (also on Eastern) is usually my go-to place for my Hawaiian food fix but I wanted to change things up and try something new.   I ordered their furikake chicken and a Hawaiian sun juice. I got a generous amount of chicken with two scoops of white rice (you can sub it for fried rice for $2 more) and mac salad. It kind of reminded me of Zippy's Korean chicken, which made me instantly nostalgic. The mac salad was really tasty and they give generous scoops of rice, which is great if you're serious about that meat to rice ratio, like I am!",

Hawaiians don't do mushy rice...It's an everyday thing where I'm from. Maybe someone just isn't paying attention here. Little too much char on the kalbi too. Possibly just a super off day, but too many other good spots around the way to be doing it wrong.  Guava cake from the off-site bakery was good though.",

I've learned after a couple visits with my family that I am not capable of finishing a plate by myself, so my sister and I always share. My favorite and what seems to be the most popular plate lunch is the Furikake Chicken. The chicken is crispy, moist, and so freaking full of flavor! I'm a creature of habit and tend to get this every time I go, but it's just too delicious to try something else! The poke is great too! The fish is cut into perfect sized cubes and it's always fresh. If you have room for dessert, they have a fridge in the corner full of different cakes... Haupia is to die for! Sometimes they even have fresh kulolo near the register that you can take to-go too! Yum!  Overall, the BEST place to go for local food in the Henderson area! Great food and even better service! The staff is awesome!",

One thing I want to definitely point out is the Kalbi Short ribs. If you're use to going to L&L, Aloha Kitchen, or #1 Hawaiian Barbecue, you're use to getting it for about 8 bucks. You'll notice here at Island Flavor that it's double, but man oh man when you get that Kalbi on your table and you open it up, you'll notice the difference. Very thick and just tender enough where you can easily bite and break it down as you chew. Juicy and the marinade they use just tastes so good. This is one of those occasions where paying more for Kalbi here compared to other spots that charge cheaper, is worth every dollar!",

I went with Hamburger Steak, a 10 oz. patty broiled and topped with mushrooms, onions, and brown gravy. This is a tasty Hawaiian standard; the hamburger was juicy, the onions were still snappy and the brown sauce coated everything.

I ordered the Teri Beef with Stir fry, it was very tasty but the stir fry really didn't have much vegetables. Maybe putting a little more onions, some bell peppers and some mushrooms would bring it up to another level.  My wife got the Shrimp Scampi. We were not aware that it was shrimp with rice. we were expecting shrimp with pasta. Suggest letting customers know it doesn't come with pasta. Also the taste really wasn't there. I couldn't put my finger on on what was missing. but as a suggestion, maybe a little more garlic/butter and maybe with some olive oil and not cook as long as the shrimp was really overcooked.  We would like to come back and support local businesses from the 808 as that's where we moved here from.  Again, please take this comment as a positive way to possibly improve rather than a negative comment/complaint.",

Phone rang and rang with no answer every time) 2. Called the Durango location for info on the eastern location as to why no answer. Girl who answered was polite and said \"that location is very busy and never answers the phone\" like it was a normal thing.  3. I make the 4 mile drive and find a whopping 1 party of four dining in with no line to order. 4. I asked the male cashier politely if they are taking orders by phone and he said yes. I said I had been trying to call a lot to place an order and he says \" I'm the one who takes calls and I haven't heard the phone ring, so.\"  I said, you might want get the line checked out because I called many times with no answer. Crickets! Deaf ears! No reply, No apologies, he didn't bother checking the phone and walked away.  I only wanted to pick up and go because the kids were hungry and because of the distance. I arrived a little more than an hour before closing time. I saw the same cashier take down the specials of the day and the cook even asked him why! Maybe he turned off the ringer to avoid business because it was almost closing time.  Just saying.",

Also got he Kalbi ribs must be a different cook because it did not look like any of the other pictures posted it was burnt and dry; Most of it inedible .   The previous post noted 4 large pieces what I got was maybe 2 1/2 pieces if you put them altogether; the ribs were cut in smaller pieces.  The service was excellent  I just went again and ordered the Kallbi plate and furikake chicken.  This time I called my order in and this the Kalbi plate was a little better but the sauce was on the bottom of the box and the flavor was light on the Kalbi.  The furikake chicken was pretty good and a good portion.  Just went back again and finally got the Kalbi just right.  The reason I came back was the note I got from Bruce asking me to try it again.  The furikake chicken was consistent.   I notice the kitchen was more attentive on the preparation and execution of the food.  The previous visits the staff was lacking the attention the food needs to be presented at its best.  Well done on the Kalbi and I had Kalbi in numerous ways in South Korea; Suwon, Seoul, Bundang..etc. and this was comparable to ones I had in Suwon.",

They served you the two entrees with two scoops of rice ( brown/jasmine) that could feed two people. The beef was tender and chicken was crispy.

When you do visit though, try and save room for desserts. Their cakes are sooooo delicious, especially the guava and the haupia (coconut) cake.

Today I went early enough that they had boxes available to purchase, so I tried one. The rice, spam and teriyaki chicken were good but the rest wasn't great. The beef was fatty and the eggs didn't have much flavor.   The photo I posted shows the little spot where they have pre made items for sale. The boxes sell out by early afternoon and the spam musubi is usually there until late afternoon, from my experience. All of the boxes there today were the one shown in my picture, so that might be the normal options.   As far as their spam musubi, I really like it because they put sauce on either side of the spam. They come with a lot of rice too.",

New owners come, change things to their own tune, because as owners, it is now their own. This was never Monkey's business. It was a favorite for sure. Monkey bring friends and families often when they came to visit, because we love to share the best things in life.   So, if new owners rather sell avocados decorated with poke, cut 1 Kalbi into 4 pieces or over marinate Teri beef, so be it. If social media is the key to running a restaurant, then why bother focusing on the food that former loyal customers crave?  Right?  Plenty new suckers with no taste come to Vegas everyday for the authentic hype.    Five Stars!  5 Whole stars for all your efforts, changes, deleting all criticism and JMPForce paid reviewers. Monkey give you 5 stars free of charge!  Monkey leave you alone. You've done enough damage yourself. Have yourself a Merry Christmas!  Just kidding.",

Food is made fresh to order, so it takes 15' on average to receive an order. I like to call ahead of time for pickup, but they often not pick up the phone during busy lunch and dinner time. Despite the long wait, lacks of waiting area, and how warm it usually is in here, this place gets 5 stars from me! All the workers are nice. They apologize for long wait time. They thank me for patience. They always have smiles on their faces. The food IS AMAZING. When in doubt, get chicken furikaki with fried rice. Fried rice always cooked to perfection. I like to order mine less salty. Macaroni salad comes as complimentary side, and it's also yummy.",

    "text": "The ambiance of Island Flavor Express was about what you can expect from an establishment with the word \"Express\" in it. The casual Hawaiian restaurant is a quiet hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall off the 215 and Eastern Ave. As soon as you walk in the door, you are engulfed in the distinct scent of steamed rice, grilling meat, and soy. The dining area, which is quite small, as they do mostly to-go and catering orders, is not much to look at. The tables, chairs, and flooring all look dilapidated and in need of repair or replacement, though everything is clean and organized. The environment is overall welcoming, as the manager personally greets each customer and seemed to immediately know when it was someone's first time (a sure sign of a loyal customer-base!).   Despite its humble appearance, the food was fantastic! The restaurant, both the dining and cooking areas, appeared clean. Though the kitchen was open to the dining area, there was not too much kitchen noise that it disrupted conversation. Besides the great food, the aroma is the next best thing I remember after walking in - the perfect combination of sweet and salty married with delicious grilled meats. I was also astonished at the portion that is served in one of their platters, which costs just $9. Not only does the meat of your choice come with two sides, but it comes with enough meat to easily feed two to three people. It was a fantastic value!  Not only was the food excellent, but the service was decent as well. Both the service staff and the kitchen staff had good attitudes and greeted people as they entered. The manager, who was serving as well, was very warm and attentive. The service was both authentic and efficient, and the staff all appeared tidy and well-groomed. The restaurant did seem well-staffed, as there was little wait time, though it was not very busy when I was there, and with increased volume, additional servers may be a good idea to keep up with their service standards.  Overall, I was very pleased with the food & service I experienced here.",

Located right off the 215 and Eastern in the Regal Plaza, right next to the PT's (the old Roadrunner bar, for those who remember that place). I had heard good things about this Hawaiian (excuse me, big island) style plate lunch spot. I had the day off, so I thought I would give it go...  First off, very small place, maybe 5 bistro style table seating to one side and the kitchen on the other side. Love the Hawaiian/Reggae music selection playing ( does anyone still call it Jahwaiian?). Decor is what you would expect, pictures of Hawaiian flowers and foliage and a representation of all the islands on the wall...but, hey, not here for decor, here for the foods.  They have a small specialized menu and daily specials board (all sounded good to me...), but I opted for the mix plate w/ the Furikake Chicken everyone's raving about and Roast Pork with gravy ($11.25). Ordered to go...when the chef called my name and handed me my plate lunch bagged up, he gave me one of those \"what's up bruddah\" chin nods. Like he knew what deliciousness I was in store for. I grabbed for my bag of food, and I swear the thing weighed like at least 5 lbs.! He noticed the surprised look on my face and smiled, I mustered a \"thanks bruddah\" and headed home.  In anticipation, I popped open my styrofoam container and...boom! Huge, I mean, HUGE portion of the chicken ( I think I might've actually gasped). For the unbelievers, see photo... Now I know what all the hype was about, the Furikake Chicken was super ono. Crunchy fried chicken nuggets of love, rolled in a honey sweet sauce and salty seaweed,bonito flakes with sesame seeds...sweet and savory, how I likes it. If I had to reminisce, I would say it kinda reminded me of the \"Tasty\" Chicken they serve at the Alley in the Aiea Bowl in Hawaii ( if you're from Aiea, you know what I'm talking about). The Roast Pork was tender and juicy, it just fell apart as I dug into it. Good gravy! The gravy was good...and the Mac salad was legit. I think there was an audible \"oh my god this is good!\" As I was nom-nomming away.  So, yeah...that happened. So delicious, but couldn't finish it...leftovers, yay!

    "text": "Big flavor. Big portions. Head to Island Flavor Express!  People who lived in Hawaii are blessed that Vegas is the 9th island. You don't have to go far to get some Island grinds. The newest addition to Henderson is located in the shopping area on Eastern Ave & Pebble.   Same owners as Island Flavor on Durango, they are a casual place-order/pick-up order or take-out service style restaurant. The staff has been incredibly friendly on each visit and the place is clean and simple, with about 6 tables inside.   Food I've ordered:  Furikake Ahi Poke Hawaiian-Style Poke Kalbi Ribs Furikake Chicken & Shrimp  Furikake Chicken - Let's cut to the chase. I don't even eat chicken. The batter and glaze they use is insane, I couldn't help but try a few pieces that were just crumb batter. OMG. Sweet and salty deliciousness! My boyfriend and toddler loved it, too. I tried the shrimp version, and they over-fried it, so I wasn't as happy with it.   Poke - The portion they give are great. The fish is cubed into good sizes. However, I can't say it's the best I've had. The fish tastes good, but I prefer the poke to have been marinated longer. Melt-in-your-mouth kind of poke...  Kalbi - Ridiculous portion and the meat is tender! Look at the posted pictures below.  Desserts - They have a rotating selection found in the fridge by the door, so you can self-serve and take it to the counter. I have yet to try any, but I've seen Chantilly, Haupia, Guava Chiffon, and Coco Puffs. They also stock Hawaiian Sun canned drinks.  Look at their chalkboard for their daily specials. They serve Lau Lau on Fridays and I've seen Mahi Mahi and Kalua Pig posted, too.  This has become one of those regular stops I'll make when I want some quick but tasty Hawaiian eats for the family. I'd love it if they could start serving oxtail soup and malasadas! That's the only thing I can say they are missing. But I'd highly recommend stopping by if you're hungry in Hendertucky!",

I have NO complaints.  The ahi was cut in good sized cubes and was so firm and fresh. The furikake chicken is the perfect sweet and salty and crunchy combo. The pork roast was perfection.  Not to mention the service was great. It seemed like all waitresses checked on all tables whether they were in their zones or not. Lots of Aloha in this place. Keep it up guys!",

Just like that with no rice. The cashier was ultra kind enough to rework my order so that I was just paying for sides of the meat instead of normal plate lunch cause I didn't want the rice and mac salad. (trying to lower my carb intake).  That was awesome of him!  Its a grab and go type place even though there is some seating available. So just expect that. I look forward to coming back with the fam to try more things.",

There portions were huge we couldn't eat all of it.  We will be hitting this place again.   The only down side is there was only like 5 tables. So there was people standing waiting on a table.

I ordered their teriyaki chicken plate and my fiance got the kalbi short ribs plate. We got a drink with or plates and the total was about $26/$28 with tax. I figured it is pricey but hopefully the portioning will make up for it. Unfortunately, it didn't. The food was good but the portioning was more on the small side.

Take out guest were a steady flow and the staff were buzzing to keep up with demand.  Wow does it smell great in here!!! I got my order to go and couldn't believe how heavy the carefully packed bag was. The friendly order guy is on point, makes sure I had utensils and napkins however reminded me to grab more on my way out with an authentic \"mahalo\" Driving to my hotel the aroma in my car was mesmerizing! When I opened it up to eat everything was crazy delicious, CRAZY DELICIOUS. The beef was tender and tasty, the chicken thighs dish crispy and magnificent and forget about the mountain of remarkable rice.  The veggie side dish had a subtle and mellow unique flavor you can't stop eating! That's the theme of this meal!!! You can't stop eating.  Loved this place, if I was local I'd eat here on a regular rotation!!!",

My favorites here are the Poke, fried rice (duh), Kalbi, Furikake Chicken, and the mac salad.

I'm always craving Hawaiian Barbecue.  This place does not disappoint.  My only gripe is that the Henderson location closes early on Sundays.  I believe they close at 4PM on Sundays.  My favorite dishes are the Chicken Katsu with the katsu sauce, Golbi beef, and the Furikaki Chicken. Comes with white rice and macaroni salad.  You can opt for the fried rice which is also really good.  The Furikaki Chicken is the star here.  I've only ever had chicken like this served at a Thai restaurant in Hawaii.  Tastes very similar to Korean style chicken. I'm not really sure whats in this or how they make it.  But this dish is heavenly.  I usually order two because it's sooooooo good.  Definitely check this place out!",

The customer service is pretty friendly and kind.   The food is great! But big tip, eat it when its fresh rather than to go. Tried the Furikake Chicken since it seemed that what its known for and it was amazing, sadly i took it to go and the freshness of it was gone but taste was still good. Gotta try to explore more of the menu. The only thing i wouldnt not get again is the musubis, theyre literally mostly rice with such a small slice of spam, eating one made my hungry go away.",

I was bummed when I got home to find it was well done instead of just seared like I had asked, especially because it's about 17 dollars.  I messaged the business, and they apologized and let me know I could come in within 10 days and get a salad on them, done the way I want. They honored it without any hassle and provided me with the proper cook on the ahi.    In addition to that I found I really enjoy their furikake chicken.  My friend had ordered it and let me try and it wasn't overly salted like some reviews had said.  It was addictive really.  So I figured the customer recovery and new found menu item merited bumping them up a star.",

The customer service was great I believe Isaiah took me take out order & he didn't steer me wrong! The food was ready in less than 10 min.... got home & found out that was too quick considering my kalbi ribs were extremely rare & fatty (Maybe they're supposed to be that way? -idk, pics attached) the other down side was that I ordered fried rice & received white rice (yes, there was an up charge so I call about it tomorrow -I called 3x when I got home & got the busy signal every time) & lastly they were out of desserts which sucks but completely understandable!  Will I try again? Definitely. (will update review) Total: 18$ (combo plate & soda)  Tip: Check your order b4 u leave (even if it's tied & ready to go), order Furikake chicken!!, specify how well you'd like your meat cooked (I love rare steaks but rare kalbi? Nah.), & tip! These guys are working hard!!",

In the end, however, it's a restaurant and the food has to be good. It's not. It feels like management was trying to save money by cutting down on quality. I still can't figure out the adobo.

I had one amazing order of the furikake chicken, and came back months later to a version that was overly thick with dry meat inside.

If you think orange chicken is good, furikake chicken is it's better-tasting cousin.   Right from the start, your eyes are slapped with a huge portion of beautifully glazed nugget-sized chicken pieces, garnished with a generous amount of sesame seeds and minced scallions.   It doesn't just look good. Unsurprisingly, it tastes good, too. The slight crunchiness and glaze give it a nice texture, the chicken pretty tender, and the taste. Oh, the taste is so flavorful without being overwhelming. Perfect for those two scoops of rice you'll be pairing the chicken with.   The plate is also accompanied by a tasty macaroni salad. It's rich and creamy, and you know, it's just good. Nothing more to say here.   I got two meals out of this baby, so it was well worth the great price.",

Also best Mac salad I've ever tried , it is a bit on the pricey side of Hawaiian good but it comes in big portion could almost be a meal for two depending on your portion size ! It's a must try place so much flavor just like the name !! This place won't disappoint you !",

    "text": "The food here is outta control.  The Mac salad is seasoned just right, not too much mayo but just enough.  The rice is tender and warm, as it should be but isn't always the case at other spots. I ordered their furikake chicken.  That was so bomb. I haven't had that before. So, that was a nice change. The flavor of the furikake really shined through and paired with rice in each bite, it was a great balance of flavor between the taste of the chicken protein, the furikake and the sauce on the food. I can't even begin to tell you how massive the adobo friend rice was too. I was not expecting anything as huge as what we got. My husband and I picked up food from here before heading to the airport. I didn't think that we'd have any trouble finishing our food but boy, we ended up consolidating both our left overs into a single take out box and well, we still had enough food for someone to enjoy a complete meal.  Their portions are large and their prices are just right for us, under $10 per plate, with the exception of an item or two depending on whether it's a special or if it's fish/seafood.  The folks who work here are friendly and witty. They're chatty but not overly so. I'd love to come back and try more things. They accept cards, thankfully. I tipped them in cash. I just don't think that you could go wrong eating here. Yum!",

I'll just save that for tonight's dinner XD Anyway... I was seriously liking the flavors of the food once I had the time to chow down! Customer service was awesome too, and I only stayed for like 5 minutes at the most. The nice cashier greeted me once I got in, and figured it was my to-go order, which she was right about. I think it was all about the demeanor, and I miss hearing the friendly Hawaiian pigeon accent.  The bonus point for me is that the place is near home! Score!",

I called and ordered and the person on the phone  told me the order will be ready and be reminded that they close at 9. When I got there 8:57 I expected my order to still be there since they said they close at 9pm. I see people are still eating inside when I get there so I knocked since the doors are locked up. The workers were just looking at me and wouldn't open the door, so then a guy finally came out at 9:02 and said all the orders were thrown out at 8:57. I was hoping for a decent notification when I called that the food will be thrown out at a certain time so I didn't have to drive there and wasted my time. Not coming here or will recommend this particular location to anyone due to this experience.   Thank you anyways and good luck.",

I stopped in for my favorite mixed plate of Kalbi ribs and Furiake Chicken and added Fried Rice instead of the white rice and its served with mac salad. Perfect flavors all around and it was enough for two meals. I also grabbed a piece of the Chantilly cake that was in a small cooler near the door. Perfect dessert for me, not two sweet and the cake was nice and moist.  Vegas is known as the 9th Island and with eateries like this all we are missing is the Beaches, Weather, and so on and so on.....! At least we can eat good!",

The restaurant itself is pretty small with only a few tables to sit at, but thankfully a large party had just left once we got there.   There were so many good local food options on the menu I had a hard time deciding what to get. Ended up ordering the furikake chicken and Kalbi mixed plate. The portions were HUGE and came with a side of mac salad. So glad I decided to share it because there was no way I was going to be able to finish it. The furikake chicken was my favorite out of the two, but I think the mixed plate is definitely the way to go if you want to try other things without having to order two separate dishes.   There were so many other things I wish I could have tried-- the loco moco, kalua pig, poke etc. Guess I just have to come back to Vegas next weekend, shucks.",

Interestingly Island Flavor separates itself from the mass of generic L&L copy cats by doing their own style and makes plate lunches that don't look so boring fluffed up with cabbage. This location is a much smaller version of the Durango location but serves up food quick to get you on your way with a few tables for sit down (if you're lucky, its alwayssss full). This location also serves bento boxes ready to go that are sitting cozy under the heat lamp with everything necessary for a very hearty meal.   Favorites will always be the furikake chicken, loco moco, and the roast pork!",

Apparently when you have to do phone orders, they have to take your card info over the phone. When I initially placed a call around 4:11pm, kindly I asked the person on the line if they could make my order and that I am already on my way. Since it takes about 20mins drive from my house, I just wanted to come by and pick it up. With the Vegas heat, I didnt want to turn off my car and order when I get to the place and wait another 10mins or so.   He declined and stated per company policy they have to get paid before picking up. Though my order was only $16+ I understand if its more than $50 it would be reasonable. Anyhow I still came and bought my food, just a little disappointed about that take out policy. Placed my order at 4:25pm, was out in 12mins or so.",

I forgot her name but the cashier that is always there taking orders is so friendly makes you feel like you're at home. Since this place is express, it is a little smaller with limited seating area. About 6 or 7  tables if I could recall. It does get busy around lunch time so try to beat the lunch rush or come after the rush.  The food portions here are huge. I wish they had 2 sizes. You can order one plate and share with 2 people and still be full.   My go to meal here is the furikake chicken. It's kind of like a Hawaiian version of orange chicken but not orange chicken. I guarantee this place is worth coming to just for that plate. I always sub the Mac salad for sauteed veggies.",

They have several different flavors/styles of (tuna) poke that they can mix up for you right then and there. You can buy as little as half lb (see my photo). One thing that I thought was kind of cool that I haven't really seen anywhere else is that you can order your poke fried. I haven't tried it yet, but what doesn't taste good fried, right?  The meat plates come with a couple scoops of rice and some mac salad to go with it.  The cuts of katsu and kalbi are always generous. If I had any feedback to give this restaurant, it's that their foods are a little on the salty side (for me, and compared to some other Hawaiian restaurants) but otherwise delicious.  If you're ever in the area and want some quick casual Hawaiian comfort food, give this place a try.",

Menu board was taken down, so you can't figure out what to order while waiting in line since menu and specials are up front with cashier, which is inefficient.   Passed up on Kalbi cause still not convinced, even after seeing the fancied up enhanced pix on IG. Plus can't justify paying 16 to 17 for a lunch plate at a fast /casual style restaurant. For few dollars more AYCE kbbq  or the lunch plate at Jun's across the way, for Kalbi is the way to go.   The Beef Stew special was good, but not as ono as Ross J's. which always sells out. Mr B liked their Loco Moco with Chicken Katsu Chicken. The portions are plenty for these dishes and pretty inexpensive.   Still something else is missin, ohana?, aloha?

Let me just say for 1/2 lb of poke for $10, it's such a good deal!!! The amount they give you and the size of each piece of tuna is awesome!!! They are also consistent with how it's made. I was hoping coming to this location it would be exactly the same as the Durango location and it was! The flavor is so good that you can't even taste that fishy tuna taste. I don't even like tuna that much but love the tuna they make here. They marinate the tuna so well and always tastes fresh. I recommend you trying it.  For a 1/2 lb of spicy avocado, sesame poke and  two spam masubi with two fountain drinks cost us $32! Such a great and filling deal!!!!",

I got the half pound Hawaiian poke and he got the furikake chicken with kalbi short ribs. My half pound was so generous, I felt like it was actually half a pound. Not like other places, where they're super cheap with their fish and give you like 8 small pieces. It was beautifully tossed with onions, shoyu, and green onions. So good. They both came with rice and mac salad. We were very impressed.   Finished both of our plates, happily!",

Although there was an L&L close to our resort, I'm glad we took the little trek to this place.  Yelp recommendations did not disappoint.  We ordered 3 dishes and spam musubi and it was enough food to feed this family of 5.  We tried the chicken katsu, beef teriyaki steak, and furikake chicken (based on reading other yelp reviews). Never had furikake chicken before, but it was delicious.  A much better and tastier version of an orange chicken.  The beef in the beef teriyaki steak were nice good chunks and very tasty.  Just taking 1 star off because of the chicken katsu.  This was our least favorite of our dishes. It didn't taste like it was cooked to order.    The place is pretty small, with only 5-6 tables for dine it, but while we were waiting for our to-go order, it looks like most people do take out at this establisment.    Will definitely be visiting again next time I'm in Vegas.",

I've seriously found my new favorite Hawaiian Fusion spot out here in Henderson!  *wink If you haven't tried Island Flavor what are you seriously waiting for?! Seriously!   After ordering my takeout order via Yelp, I arrived early and was able to small talk with the workers. Island Flavor is a family ran restaurant and is one of its kind! As soon as I walked in, my nose was mesmerized, it's smelt SO delicious - I wanted to lick the walls! The open-style kitchen is brilliant because the smell from everything being cooked immerses the entire restaurant! After 'bout 10 minutes my food was ready. I'm surprised I didn't get a speeding ticket driving home because the smell from my take out bag was driving me nuts- it smelt THAT good, I couldn't wait to get home!  I ordered the mixed plate; my combination included the fruikake chicken and kalbi beef short ribs. I opted to try the fried rice instead of steam rice. After upgrading to the kalbi short ribs (+$3 extra) and the fried rice (+$2 extra), my dinner was totally worth it! Peep my pictures y'all, they don't even do it justice! The chicken had such a nice crunchy texture with a sweet and savory glaze sauce, SO good! The fried rice was bursting with flavor with chunks of pork slices &The Kalbi Beef short ribs, delicious, duh.   At the end of the day, I didn't feel guilty after spending almost $15 for a mixed dinner plate. I barely finished half, so in my eyes I'm getting two meals out of one. That's winning in my book!",

The restaurant is more of a take out shop, but there are enough tables/chairs that you'll be able to eat in if you choose.  Furikake chicken: Imagine orange chicken, but better. The quality of rice here is always a lot better than the other restaurants I go to. The rice is a little closer to the moist flavorful Japanese rice than that dry white stuff they call rice here in America. The macaroni salad is GOOD. I hate to admit it but since Macaroni salad is the one thing you always get at every Hawaiian restaurant, it plays a big part in how I rank my Hawaiian restaurants. The macaroni salad here does not disappoint. Super creamy, super thick, just how I like it.  Spam musubi: The one here at Island Flavor has furikake in it instead of the usual brown sauce. If you're expecting the sweet sauce flavor that spam musubi usually has, you might be a little disappointed in the one here.  Katsu chicken: Super thick pieces of katsu! the breading to chicken ratio has to perfect and Island Flavor really gets it down.",

It will either ring for 5 minutes and go to some weird answering machine or you will get a busy signal \"user busy\" this happened 2 days ago. I'm driving home from work, decide to stop at the gas station and make a call to island flavor so I could pick up my order and it would be ready by the time I got there.. After 10 minutes of failed call attempts.. I walk into the restaurant and only one customer inside.. Not SO busy they couldn't answer the phone.   Literally the best Hawaiian food in vegas. I always get the Teri beef, my gf gets the kalbi ribs. They use the most quality meat I've ever tasted at any Hawaiian BBQ place. The Teri beef plate is like a giant steak cut up into thick cutlets. It's enough for 2 meals. One now and one later :D  The macaroni salad is probably my favorite part, it's ridiculously flavorful. I recommend island flavor to every single one of my friends and every tourist I meet that loves Hawaiian food. My tip to anyone ordering : call in your order to save some time waiting for food.",

Double carbs (two scoops rice, one scoop mac salad), loads of protein doused in gravy or coated in sticky, sweet teriyaki sauce.  2,000+ kcal, and two days of saturated fat.  I know I'm gonna catch heat from da bruddahs back home, but plate lunch here is better than almost any in Hawaii if you excuse the strange \"mainland\" menu items ie French fries or sauteed veg sub for rice.  Eater Vegas calls it Hawaiian BBQ.  Deeply marinated untrimmed, fatty, shortribs in a soy, sugar, ginger concoction, grilled and served on the bone.   Sweet, juicy, fatty; the burnt bits adding character, pulling the uber flavorful membrane from the bone and chewing it like a dog chews a rawhide, an added bonus.  Their furikake chicken, deep fried nuggets of chicken, heavily coated in flour and doused in a sticky sweet teriyaki sauce with laver and sesame seeds good eats.  Some overcooked, dry and chewy (da sauce taste better on those), larger nuggets moist and juicy.  Solid loco moco and hamburger steak with pan gravy.  Good beef stew made with fatty chunks of well braised beef (not dry and stringy). Huge spam musubi.  Pass  on the katsu, poke (previously frozen fish), fried shrimp, and teriyaki chicken (doused in sauce after being cooked).  Friendly counter service.  Inexpensive with most plate lunches $9 - $10.

We went around 1230pm and the place was pretty packed with people. Glad we called our order ahead of time or else we would've spent our whole lunch hour probably waiting. The place seems like it's family owned and you can see everything out in the open. From the spices they use on the top shelf to the chicken that comes out of the fridge before it gets fried. Pretty cool. Your plates will come standard with 2 scoops of rice and Mac salad. I wish they opened one close to home!",

That is how good it is. The furikake chicken was done perfectly, crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside, lots of good sauce. The mac salad was awesome too. Nice and creamy with just the perfect amount of dressing. We will be back to get all of our favorites, fried poke salad, loco moco, fried rice omelet.

A lot of Hawaiian places do not take AmEx, which is fine but I would rather use my company card when on the road.  It's not a deal maker or breaker for me, but it instantly gives them at least half a star for my purposes.  The food is so ono!  Last night I ordered the mixed plate with katsu and kalbi.  The mac salad is legit.  The chicken katsu was moist, which is rare for a thin cut like that.  The kalbi was delicious!  The rice was perfectly cooked.  It's the best Hawaiian food I've had since leaving Pearl City.  The decor is nothing fancy... as it should be.  The Jawaiian music is playing.  The people are nice and take the time to learn the names of their customers.  This place just feels like home.  I am going back for lunch today since I have to leave tomorrow.

Need I say more - Korean chicken, Spam Musubi, Saimin, Poke, Oxtail Soup ( at times), Kalbi Short Ribs, Furikake Chicken, Chicken Teriyaki and more.  The choices here are excellent.  I wish they had the saimin and oxtail all the time.   4.  Service - This is more self serve, order and sit down, they will bring things out to you too.  Everyone is great and courteous.  Very efficient.  5.  The only issue.... - They are too small unlike their main store off Durango.  Sometimes it is too busy here.

I'm glad I don't crave Hawaiian food all that much otherwise I'd probably avoid this place and go up the street to Ohana where the service is way more friendly.   Anyway, the last time I came in, there were 3 women up at the seating area. I had ordered to go. All 3 women had seen me and I smiled at them, but all looked away and continued doing what they were doing. I understand being busy, but at least say hi, especially if I've already maintained eye contact and smiled at you.   It took a good few minutes for one of them to finally verbally acknowledge me and gather my order. There was another order right next to mine. After I paid, they just started to walk away. I said, \"oh are both these bags mine?\" And she said, \"no, just this one\" and looked annoyed. Okayyyyyy so then how would I know whose is whose, I'm not a mind reader.   Will I be back? Probably within the next 6 months, sure. This wasn't the first time there were blatantly rude. Could be the culture? I've been to Hawaii multiple times and have cousins from there but they all seems nice...no idea what's going on here?",

So am I since this location is not like the original one on durango.  Setting: In the regal colonade plaza on pebble, it is right next to a smoke shop and on the side of PT's Ranch. A smaller restaurant but still places to sit and eat.   Service: Service here is fantastic. I have never received bad service especially from a Hawaiian restaurant. The young lady behind the counter was very engaging and we ended up talking more than I had time to eat haha.  Food: Ok the most important part. The furikake chicken and kalbi are the stars of this show here. Luckily the kalbi is still on point but their signature furikake chicken is different. They over fry and batter their furikake chicken and makes them really hard and crunchy. NO BUENO!!! Cut back on the batter and don't fry them to the point where they're gonna start popping like popcorn. Also AVOID AVOID getting the furikake shrimp, same story as the chicken and they only give you 4 pieces of shrimp.  Overall: I want to just drive to the original location but this spot is way more convenient. Pleaseeeee follow up on my review about the frying process! Thanks guys!",

I had the furikake chicken and can I just say dayummm. It was an explosion of flavor and crispiness that spread throughout my tongue and left me wanting for more with each bite. It was perfectly sauced, tasting a bit sweet which balanced out with the white rice. Portion size of the chicken and rice itself was very generous. I felt so full that I went back to my friend's apartment and took an hour nap due to food coma. You know somethings good if you had to rest and recover for that long. The meal also came with macaroni salad that was also delicious. I'm generally not the biggest fan Mac salad because most places put too much mayo but this was had the perfect proportion. I would've finished it if the they didn't give so much rice and chicken. Being from LA, this is definitely a pit stop the next time I go to Vegas and make more almost regrettable decisions.",

I was a Thursday and Friday regular after work. I got a hamburger steak/ furikaki chicken plate and a Teri beef/ furikaki chicken plate. They were very generous with portions and it was ono. I thought that perhaps new ownership had changed this little gem. After a wonderful conversation with Isaiah, I realized that nothing has changed, same people, same great service, new chef adding more specials and the new owners are really working hard at connecting with community of Islanders and doing better. I am so glad the timing was there last night to make it for dinner.",

    "text": "I've never had Furikake Chicken and it was amazing! One yelper mentioned it was like \"The Hawaiian version of orange chicken\" and that's what it is minus the orange flavor. The best part is that it's made fresh so it is extremely crunchy and did not have a soggy breading texture like panda express. The macaroni salad is delicious and not as tangy as L&L. I wish their portions for the macaroni salad was bigger!  The short ribs were delicious, flavorful and had great char marks.  Also had the guava cake, the cake itself and the guava jam is really good. Not overly sweet and the guava flavor is noticeable. I just was not a fan of the cool whip frosting. I love real whipped cream. Will probably stick with the Furikake Chicken only, for next time!  Service was great!",

Our favorites to get are the Beef Teriyaki Steak, Kalibi Short Ribs, and the Ahi Poke. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great.  They were super nice when we came in at 8:30 pm to dine-in. (They close at 9.) Our kids eat slow, but they did not mind that we left 5 minutes after they closed. We didn't feel rushed at all to eat our food and get out of there.",

We also got the chicken katsu, kalua pork, shrimp, & the Korean chicken, which were all good but not as tasty as the other ones.   The service was friendly & helpful. The inside was small & clean.

I got the furikake chicken and kalbi combo and let me tell you, my container was filled to the brim with food. And ah it was so so good. Kalbi ribs were nice and thick and juicy and meaty and tasted amazing (unlike some places, ahem, a place that rhymes with \"a mocha thicken\" comes to mind, that serve super thin kalbi ribs that are 80% fat). Furikake chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and super flavorful. I couldn't stop eating even though I was already full, AND I still have a ton of leftovers. LOVE this place.
