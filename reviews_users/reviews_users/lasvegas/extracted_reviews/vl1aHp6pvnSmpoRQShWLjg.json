    "text": "My husband and I came here Saturday night when the craving struck. We didn't have a reservation but were able to phone ahead. I would certainly recommend a reservation or phoning ahead because there were people waiting 45 minutes plus at both the casino and exterior entrances.  There was live music which was nice but noisy for us. Our server was friendly although obviously quite busy.  I ordered a platter with pulled pork, smoked chicken, and rib tips. Gotta try them all right. Sides were coleslaw and greens. I did not enjoy the rib tips, they were quite tough. Chicken was moist and tasty but the pulled pork was definitely the stand out. Coleslaw was good but the greens were a little too salty. My husband ordered the brisket with bbq beans and Mac and cheese. He felt the brisket was too lean and not tender enough. He loved both the Mac and cheese and the beans. I tasted the beans and would certainly order them again.  I would try this place again, most likely when fiending for a pulled pork sandwich. Still searching for great ribs though...",

Ordered the Moscow Mule. They served it in a frufy glass and not a copper mug. Had agave syrup. Not a huge fan. Not a real Moscow Mule.  The server was not as attentive as a server should be.  I had the full rack of Baby Backs. The wrong order was brought to our table. They were good. The sides were good. Would have been nice to have a side of BBQ sauce.  We were there just over an hour. Their famous biscuits and apple butter which were promised prior to the meal never arrived. We were told they ran out and were in the oven. At the point we were paying our bill I got the same story from the server.  I spoke to the manager and he handed us a bag of biscuits to go within moments. If you are going to offer a signature biscuit, one had better manage the kitchen better.  I really do like Lucille's in general, but this review was based on this specific visit.  Updated: The management reached out to me and apologized and gave me a $25 card for a future visit. They must care.",

    "text": "Updating my previous review after being contacted by Lucille's management and offered a $25 gift card to come back and give Lucille's another try.   My husband and I popped back into Lucille's this past Saturday after seeing an afternoon movie at Red Rock. The casino was quite busy with the Derby and the pending Mayweather/Pacquio fight. The restaurant was quite slow - I think it was probably 4 pm?  We were sat immediately in a two-top table, slightly awkward to get to because of it's location in a corner right behind another table that was seated. We were greeted within a few minutes by Nate who was friendly.   I ordered a blackberry margarita and hubs ordered sweet tea. His sweet tea came first after Nate informed us that the original cocktail meant for me spilled and had to be remade. No problem.   We ordered our meals - pulled pork sandwich for me, fried chicken special for hubs. We were offered biscuits while we waited which were hot and fresh. (Side note...these still aren't like any biscuits I've ever had and, being from the south, I would never think to dust the biscuits with sugar...but, ok).   Food arrived - mine first with my husband's trailing after. Plates felt as if they had been sitting in the expeditor's window but ok..we got our food. My pulled pork was fine and as expected. Hubs' fried chicken special consisted of two fried chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, saw mill gravy on the side and an ear of corn.  Hubs wasn't thoroughly impressed with the chicken - after tasting a bite, it seemed to be lacking seasoning or flavor in the chicken and in the breading. Overall, it was fine and he finished most of his plate and was full.   We enjoyed the meal as it was, and the service from Nate. Being the bbq connoisseurs we think we might be, Lucille's doesn't make the grade for us but other folks will probably enjoy it.  The food prices, in my humble opinion, don't match the quality or flavor.   Giving Lucille's an upgrade to 3 stars because they cared enough to get us to come back and the return experience was better than the original.",

    "text": "Growing up in Texas, I'm a pretty hard customer to please when it comes to barbecue. Lucille's did not do it for me, but with limited options in Vegas, I wouldn't completely write them off.  Opted for quite a variety of menu options, don't know that I'd highly suggest any of them. Definitely consider starting with an alcoholic beverage, the house margarita was tasty- I forget it's clever name though.  Complimentary BISCUITS upon seating- topped with cinnamon sugar why? Would be so much better unseasoned with regular butter, as others have said. BRISKET CHILI- large portion, tasty, but brisket isn't as flavorful as I'd like. Adding cheese and sour cream kind of covers up some of the flavor. Cornbread is sweet, which isn't my preference. PULLED PORK SANDWICH- large and juicy, top bun is disposable as there's nothing on it and the bun is quite large. Not really a sandwich you can easily pick up to eat. Served with fresh-made chips, which were actually quite delicious.  TRI SALAD- salad topped with tri-tip and grilled veggies, gigantic in size and fresh. Worth a try if you're on a salad or health-centric kick, the meat is a good portion and isn't dry, which still makes it enjoyable for a steak at a bbq joint. CHICKEN QUESADILLA AND GRILLED ARTICHOKE- had high hopes for this meal made of two half-size entrees, but was underwhelmed. Barbecue chicken in the quesadilla isn't particularly flavorful, despite simply being accompanied by grilled peppers and onions. LIghtly topped with a mostly-decorative design of red pepper sauce and barbecue sauce, this simply had too much going on and the chicken seemed bland, easily overpowered by everything else in the dish. Artichoke was artfully presented but a little difficult to eat, all but diehard artichoke fans need not apply.  Layout is a little odd, with a street entrance and a casino entrance- on a weekend afternoon, signage at the front of the latter instructed us to go through the restaurant to the other side of the bar to the other hostess stand for seating. Having never been there before, it was difficult to find and we basically wandered the dining room until we turned the corner making the stand itself visible. Not such a great plan- maybe have staff on the lookout to escort guests to the right place.  Service was fairly attentive despite a shift change during our meal, bonus points for the classic Ball canning jars used as water glasses. We were seated facing the bar, which has three TV screens above it, someone please change the middle TV from cartoons- bizarre choice of programming as this isn't really a child-friendly place.",

As we were being seated we walked through the entire restaurant closest to the casino side. Here's when I started thinking what the heck is going on in here. We walked by about 20 tables and of those tables 10 were all dirty covered with plates, hmmm?? No busser? As we were seated we were greeted fast and ordered drinks. We got our drinks and ordered our appetizer we got the Chicken Fingers and BBQ potato chips BOTH were delish! By now 5 tables were all sat within 5 minutes in our servers section. He was trying his best to accommodate everyone but that's a lot all at once. I then watched a manager walk over passing at least 5 dirty tables not picking up one dirty plate or even to ask to fill a soda up saw that he was in over his head and drowning and walk away not even asking him if he needed help. We ordered our food, Pulled pork sandwich and he got the ribs with cole slaw and macaroni. It was all very good! When the food runner dropped off his ribs he said the macaroni was on its way but it never came and bc our server was way to busy we didn't get a chance to tell him. He handled it well and got us a desert on the house, snickers ice cream cake which was awesome as well.  I work in the industry so I know what the server was going through. He had no help, no busser, AND the food runner forgot part of our order and no manager support. You get 3 stars bc Kevin was a great server but your restaurant as a team SUCKS.   PS. Install a soda well in the back part of the restaurant so that the servers don't have to walk a mile to fill up people's drinks.",

The waiters were fine, kind of scattered everywhere trying to accomodate everyone. I think we had a catered dinner. My lemonade tasted actually fresh and cool. It wasn't too sugary which was a plus. The cinnamon rolls in the beginning were deliciOus! Then we had an array if ribs, chicken, mash potatoes, mac n' cheese, salad, etc. The way it was cooked was good. I really enjoyed everything.",

We ordered drinks and our food and after waiting for about 30-40 minutes three of us got half of our meal and the fourth person got their whole order. We were told that our side dishes would be out shortly so we began to eat. Our waiter never checked on if our sides came so I stopped him and reminded him that we hadn't received them yet...so we finish our meat and Reno (our server) comes and asks if we wanted dessert or our check? I say if like our check but we never received what we ordered. When he realizes what happens he look a bit embarrassed and apologizes and says that he will go speak to his manager. He comes back and the manager took $10 off our bill. I will go back at least once more in hopes that it was an off night. On this occasion out experience started off great, better than we expected and gradually went down from there.",

We were told a 15 minute wait, n after asking for a table instead of a booth, we were made to wait an additional 15 minutes n then told the reason it took longer was because they were putting a table together, now what is a shame is that they already had tables of 6 that we cud have sat at. After asking again why it was taking so long we were given apologies, to have a young man come to escort us, who walked backwards the entire way to the smallest table of 6 that was in the restaurant.  First off any one that thinks walking backwards while talking to your customers is great customer service is badly mistaken.  In this environment in our society to not feel this was intentional because we are people of color is very difficult.  We walked right out of the restaurant by 2 Managers not one of them even stopped us to inquire why we were leaving.  But that's okay we're from Calif and have Lucille's n r area, because we will never come to this one again!",

It took almost 10 min to get waters and another 5 after that to get our alcoholic drinks. Our server was not attentive at all. Service was horribly slow and after getting our order in, food came out in waves. My food was cold but our server never came back to check to see if we needed anything. I had to get up and seek out a manager just to get the rest of our food and other things we had asked for several min earlier. Again, it was a pretty empty restaurant. When our server finally did come back I told him he could take my plate. He asked if everything was ok and I told him it was cold. He did what he could offering to get my something else and he did take off my sandwich which was delicious just cold. He also took care of our appetizer.   When you make a reservation and still have to wait 45min past it..not acceptable and the manager could care less...awful",

    "text": "Decided to give Lucille's a try after having previously decided on going to the Yardhouse for Xmas dinner.  We are glad we did.  They had just opened for lunch  so we were seated quickly.  Lucille's had some great lunch specials that grabbed my attention quickly.  The server Ricardo was very helpful in explaining the menu and a little about Lucille's showing us the smoker in the dining room and explaining some of the processes, the house made BBQ sauces. Ricardo even made some suggestions and I don't usually fall for these sales tactics but since he was being effective at his job and it was the holiday I went along with his recommendations.  In fact the service we received from Ricardo makes this a 5 star visit and most likely why we will be back.  To start we had the fried pickles with mustard sauce which came out from the kitchen quickly.  These pickle spears were huge.  I might get the half order next time because this was plenty of app to start.  Next they have these fresh made biscuits served with apple butter.  They tasted sugar crusted and were so light a flakey and hot out of the oven. Yum!  I decided on the combo platter with 3 Spare Ribs, Brisket Burnt Ends, and Pulled Pork and I chose the Mac n Cheese for my side.  No garnish of lettuce for this plating, They wanted to highlight the meat only.  The portions were good and definitely filling.  With everything else I had I did not even attempt to tackle the side.  The burnt ends were a little chewy, I think I was expecting a little more tenderness.  The pulled pork was shredded nicely and sauced appropriately.  I did need a slice of bread to go with these items but I decided on slapping the meat on one of the biscuits.  Spare Ribs were fall off the bone cooked to perfection.  ON each table they have 3 featured sauces for your taste bud tantalizing.  My favorite was the spicy.   We also had the Garden burger which came out with a nice smokey flavor.  Ricardo came out and informed us of all the vegetarian options that Lucille's offer's and how they cane make many of their pasta dishes with out meat for those dietary needs.    Overall great experience for our first Lucille's experience.  I have not someone been so accommodating at an eating establishment in a long time and Ricardo was rewarded nicely for it.  He set the bar pretty high for future visits and I hope we are not let down.  Thank You Ricardo. We will be back.",

The bad news, its only available in the bar part and they wont honor it in the restaurant part. So if its crowded and there are no seats in the bar, you get the pleasure of paying basically double because you have to sit in the restaurant. Terrible policy  I really do like their brisket nachos, sliders, onion strings, burgers, burnt ends and hot and spicy sauce.  Its in Red Rock so its priced casino style, a little higher than it should be.",

Quality and always well seasoned, not overly sauced when served and never over cooked.  Im told the pork are better than the beef...by my roommates... unfortunately, I don't do swine..so gotta take their word for it. Oooh-wee...the sweet tea is on point and served in huge mason jars...the fried pickles are always a good place to start for apps..artichokes were pretty good as well...could've been a tad bit more done.  BAD Called ahead for reservations (4 ppl) requested a high chair, as well.  When we were sat the host must have not known we were in a  *fire zone* booth.  Because after apps we requested the chair then we're told we can't have it due to fire code and blocking  walk area?  Well...you sat us hear?? Didn't offer to change tables...weird?  Manager came by later and apologized for inconvenience and removed 20% off bill. Nice but passing an infant back n forth taking turns eating sucks...would've given the service a solid 4 star but the service short fall bummed down to a 3.5..  P.s. Daisy our server was excellent...kudos to Daisy for the great recovery because she handled it well",

Want crazy about the cheese sausage.  Ask them not to put the BBQ sauce on it. Masks the flavor of the meats.  Had the rib tips and St. Louis ribs. Not dried out this time.  Had the greens and Mac and cheese. Again not great. Greens were limp and destroyed. Mac was just put in the salamander and melted cheese over the overly creamy elbows. They need to flavor it up and thicken it. Maybe add an egg and some cayenne or sriachi. She brought me out the peanut Coke slaw and cheese grits. The jalapeno in the cheese grits was tasty but they could get that same heat with a better pepper.  Overall I enjoyed it much more and will come back to try the huge beef ribs I saw.",

Service is awesome. Food was BBQ to its core.  They have complementary biscuits, generous drink sizes and even warm wet towels to wipe of the mess of food you ate.  Good choice if you like burgers and BBQ",

The service was excellent and the servers were friendly, but it is NOT necessary to soak EVERYTHING in sugary sauce and say it's a marinade.  Well smoked meat does not require sugary marinades.  The brisket was my only option for a less sugary meal and it was not soaked in sauce, however, it was dry and not as tender as a well smoked brisket can and should be.  Even the buttermilk biscuits were sugary and sweet.  This obsession with \"sweet\" in everything is ridiculous.",

I ordered the Brisket Nachos which the menu describes as being covered with sliced brisket. There was NO brisket on the plate and instead about 6 tiny pieces of something that resembled dried cat food; one teaspoon of sour cream and one teaspoon of guacamole and no black beans as described. I also ordered Onion Straws which arrived cold, limp and greasy. It took so long to get anybody including our waitress attention that everyone else had finished eating so obviously I had no dinner. I will add that I had a bite of one persons chicken and anothers bite of  ribs and both were very good but not good enough to bring me back.",

But I don't hate on chains, as long as they are done right.  And this place is definitely done right.    Everything our party of 8 ordered was great (with the exception of the fried pickles, but my Kentucky upbringing makes me a fried pickle connoisseur).  The roasted artichoke appetizer almost made up for the fried pickles.  I had the smokehouse slider trio as my entree and have no complaints.  Great BBQ at reasonable prices.",

The beer came about 30 seconds before the food which does not mean he beer took a long time, it means the food came out in less than five minutes. Do I look like a bum you have to rush out? At least the food was good, the brisket with beans (not corn or baked potato) and greens. Still not a fan of these guys there a lot of better barbecue places in Vegas!",

The seats are comfortable, you don't feel crammed, and there are plenty of TVs.  From where we were sitting, each guy was easily able to see his NFL game of choice.    But, the food fell short of the District location.  The fried onion straws were pretty much the same, they needed seasoning.  But, I find this to be the issue at the District location as well.  My catfish po' boy, on the other hand, was nowhere near the quality I get at the District location.  The bread was tough, not quite stale, but certainly not fresh.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the sandwich, which comes with 2 sauces, was nearly dry.  So, I had to order more of each sauce (a remoulade and tartar sauce).  This wait caused the sandwich to cool down, which made eating it less pleasant when I finally got the sauces.  The macaroni and cheese was standard, it was similar if not exactly the same as the District location.  I'm sure I'll give the Red Rock Lucille's another shot.  The service was good, and like I said, it's a much better bar area.  But, I'll order something else and hope that this food is more similar to the food I've enjoyed for years at the District location.",

Was told there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait, even though more than half of the restaurant was completely empty.  Our waitress, whose name starts with an M and ends with a shell, hehe, took our order and disappeared. The food came out and was delivered by the food runner, and our waitress just went missing. She did not come back to ask if we needed anything, she did not check on our drinks, NOTHING.  The other waitresses didn't give a darn either, they were trying not to make eye contact as they knew we needed our bill, to go boxes, etc.  I finally flag down our waitress and politely ask for the check, it takes her 10 minutes to drop it off and ANOTHER 10 minutes to ring us up. Goodness! I'm writing this because our service was just way too slow. I felt our server was friendlier and nicer to the other tables for whatever reason. I'm disappointed in the service. Not sure what it is with these chain restaurants. The staff just looked miserable, from the host to the bartenders. I won't be back. The food was ok, nothing to write home about.

I read some reviews here on Yelp and we decided to give it a go.  First of all, Hubby is from Kansas City (Bar-B-Que Headquarters of the USA) and VERY discerning when it comes to smoked meats! We decided to order a combo of Baby Back Ribs and Tri Tips. We had never heard of Tri Tips before and our server, Jill, did a great job of explaining the difference between them and Burnt Ends.   The Tri Tips were tender, juicy and flavorful. The Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious! We both were not impressed with the Original or the Memphis sauces, but the Hot and Spicy sauce was excellent!! We got Creamy Coleslaw and Honey Peanut Slaw for sides and both were delicious! We also ordered some Cornbread, which was yummy, and enjoyed the light, fluffy biscuits. I agree with other reviews that the biscuits really do not need the sugar on top!  For drinks we opted for a 1/2 caraf of Layer Cake Malbec, a delicious and a perfect pairing for the smokey meats!! We were impressed with the \"caraf\" option for wines, as we really didn't want a full bottle.   We will definitely be returning and highly recommend getting the Gift Cards from Costco - $79 for 2 $50 Gift Cards.",

I could eat a whole bowl of it. The biscuits and apple butter are to die for! Their baby back ribs are my favorite ribs. Their thanksgiving specials are amazing as well. I haven't really tried their pasta plates but for meat, the pulled pork is my favorite. It has the most juice and flavor to me. The snickers pie is the dessert that you need to try coming here! They do catering and have two different kinds of family basket things.",

Seems like we have been consistently ignored, long waits to see our server, order mistakes and other annoyances.  That being said, the food is so good I keep coming back!  Feed me that BBQ goodness!  Recently came for lunch and they have a good lunch menu, again, service was awful.  Waited too long to see our server, another 10 minutes passed between drink order and food (they weren't busy) and they brought our orders out separately.   Again, food was bomb though lol.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and almost made love to the second half.",

Totally dropped the ball on the entire service.  Biscuits came and were burnt, asked for plain butter never received it because she was already on her spill of selling... food always comes out nicely, asked our runner for plain butter she replies \"I'll tell your server\" well we knew we weren't getting it from here. Onto the meal...baked potatoes were lukewarm, pulled pork wasn't hot either nor moist like normal.  But again here comes Savannah ready to sell us on dessert already.  Brings our hot towels when we weren't even finished with our meal...nothing like cold towels.  I get it it's a holiday Mother's Day but that's why we were there to get waited on, don't bother carry out because they don't care about the service you receive at this one.",

    "text": "Honestly one of the best places to go for a barbecue if you don't want to barbecue at home. We usually sit in the garden area because it is themed perfectly And very fun to be around. I usually get the three meat combo and one of the best things to get on the menu is the brisket the chicken and the pork hot links. The sides really aren't my favorites but the potato salad and the beans are something that One generally can't mess up so it does the trick. For an appetizer the smoky bacon deviled eggs are amazing perfectly seasoned and they give you enough for what it's worth and I like that I can eat three and take the rest home. The fried okra is decent, I do like the ranch dipping sauce that is on the side, but the snickers ice cream pie does need some work I tasted a little bit too much snickers not enough ice cream if that makes any sense the crust was a little too hard so it was hard to cut into at the bottom and chewing through it you have the frozen chocolate in the frozen Caramel that tends to get stuck to the teeth so not a good eating experience when it comes to dessert but overall Lucilles is a very good place to go for a barbecue and is a place that I frequent",

We were told they would have to charge us for a full order of chips! I'm sorry what? That is the most absurd thing I have EVER heard and I go to many many restaurants all over and this is the first time I have been denied TORTILLA chips. I didn't say my dip ran out and I needed more dip for my chips I just needed a handful of chips. I looked at them baffled and just said forget it. I was VERY displeased with this experience and I don't see myself or my family returning.  EDIT: I did receive a message from a manager and she was very sorry that this happened! She was very kind and wanted another chance to show they can deliver great service. She sent us a gift card to try them out again and because of the immediate response and concern we will give this another try!!",

We were there on a Sunday but after the usual lunch rush and we were seated immediately.  The place is designed to look like a Memphis neighborhood and it's adorable.  You feel like you are in a private courtyard having a down home BBQ.  The staff is very friendly and abundant.  At times I felt that there was more staff than customers, but they are happy to be at work and it reflects.  We ordered Fried Okra <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QPkwidK5tNowIAqaXyhW5g&userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  and Fried Green Tomatoes <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=frsSYty3-wDSpFLo6poEfw&userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  as our starters.  They were both excellent but the sauces they served them with really made them stand out.  The BBQ Ranch sauce they make is fabulous.  For our main courses I ordered the Carolina Baked Potato with pulled pork, cheese, red onions and BBQ ranch sauced stuffed in it.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  It was really tasty and I could not eat the whole thing.  It came with a side Caesar Salad.  Hubby ordered the St. Louis Ribs with Tri-Tip off of the lunch menu, it comes with a side and he chose the shoestring potatoes.  He loved his meal except the ribs are a dry rub not sauced and he found them very dry.  They do have several signature BBQ sauces on the table to use though.  We really enjoyed our meal but there was a very VERY long wait for our main courses, which made no sense to me because realistically this type of food has already been prepared hours earlier.  The staff apologized and would keep reassuring us that it was on the way, but they never gave us a reason for the long wait.  The appetizers came out immediately and I know those had to be prepared per order, so I am confused.  Definitely would go back for another visit, but we if they make us wait like that again, it will be a pass.",

Our server didn't even realize we were sitting there until the host saw we were still waiting. Our server greeted, brought drinks & put in a food order for a table that sat next to us just a second before we were seated. Another table that was seated 10 minutes after us, had drinks & started ordering appetizers. Trust me, I get it if you're in the weeds when you're serving, but you need to have some sense of urgency. Looked like she was only taking care of 4 tables, all parties of 2-4, I don't see what the problem was. Nonetheless, she was a very sweet server & smiled.   But the food is amazing, as always. By the way, the onion straws are so good! A half order is huge, so unless you're with a large party, I wouldn't get a full order.  Oh & they forgot to bring out our cornbread, which we totally forgot about cause we didn't get it until we were finished with our food. The corn bread: 2/5 eh.",

Taking the time to read my review to make the experience as good as the food is what it's all about! Thank you for listening to your customers!   Such good food!! If you love BBQ this is the place to go. The food is so amazing and our waitress was super friendly and had great suggestions when I was torn on entrees. If you love pulled pork you have to try the pulled pork queso dip! And haveeee to get the biscuits with apple butter! OMG!    The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the host at the front. I didn't catch his name since he didn't have a name tag on but he was not warm and welcoming which is the whole point of having a host! I asked him where the restrooms were and he completely ignored my question and began talking on the headset he was wearing for about a minute before saying \"what did you say?\" Was not a good way to start the meal but other then that, everything else was great.",

Though he requested we be seated in the bar area for happy hour, we weren't. When I requested the happy hour menu, our server said we had to move tables. No worries. We were handed off to Brett, who had a great sense of humor. He gave my Mom a hard time about being hangry and shooting him the stank face as he offered us the special. I went with the brisket nachos and a lemonade. The lemonade was awesome, as were the nachos (I cleaned my plate!). I had a bite of hubby's bacon and cheddar mac and cheese, but I didn't love it. I do like that they give you hot towels rather than moist towelettes. I didn't really need it, but those in our fam that got meatier meals were pleased with them and were able to clean their faces. The biscuits were really good as well, but a little bit too crumbly as it kept falling apart as I tried to cut it. I skipped dessert in favor of the biscuit. You can enter through the parking lot and skip the walk through the casino. Definitely good for a chain restaurant. We'll definitely be back!",

I liked the bbq chicken most of all.  It was moist and the smoky flavor made it so tasty.  I barely added any bbq sauce to it.  I loved that you didn't have to ask for extra sauce if needed.  There were two full bottles already on the table.  One regular and the other spicy, both very flavorful.  What I liked about the beef rib is that you just had to tackle it with both hands and just gnaw the meat right off the bone and with not a thought of decorum.  Unlike a lot of people who prefer the meat that just falls off the bone,  I enjoy using my \"canines\".  The pieces of tri tip, however,  got a C-.  It was only because I'm accustomed to it being medium rare.  Between the smoking, grilling and warming for serving, it inevitably gets to be well done and a bit dry.   The beans were on the sweet side, just as I like it.",

    "text": "I love BBQ. I was borned and raised in Oklahoma--so you can't NOT love BBQ coming from there.  I've had some amazing BBQ in my life from all over the US. Is this the best? No. Is it good? Yes.  Some reasons why this place is one of my favorites in town: The food is consistent.  They have great BBQ sauce.  Their burnt ends are delicious.  Their sides are great.  Their biscuits are fucking amazing.   I've pretty much tried all of their meats here. They're all very good. I would like a little more tenderness to it or a smokey flavor. But it's not going to change. They're great for what they are. And for the price you pay, you get a heeping portion. So for us people who love to gorge or have leftovers--it's great.   They're service is always hit or miss. Numerous times we've been here, the hotesses aren't the most friendly. They don't even greet you when you walk in--or they don't tell you they'll be with you in a minute. We've stood there awkwardly for awhile sometimes.  Their waiters aren't the best either. Either they're amazing or they suck horribly.  The bartenders have always been awesome though. So I prefer to sit at the bar if we don't have other people with us.   Overall, if we want BBQ and don't want to drive far; we come here. There are some amazing joints in town for BBQ. This one sits right below the amazing ones.",

However, my husband got the brisket burger with fries and it was amazing and I got the Cajun shrimp avocado salad and it was awesome as well.

    "text": "The Skinny: The food is okay but definitely not special at all - pretty generic actually (3) service: generally good for lunch (3) value: kind of pricey for the quality unless you have a discount (2.5 starred review).  I was introduced to Lucille's BBQ by the hubs. The first time was the location in Henderson which was pretty delish. However over time, the quality of the food definitely degraded to the point that we didn't go anymore.  Enter in the Summerlin branch at Red Rock Casino. As a local, Red Rock periodically sends out coupons to entice you to come visit them. We couldn't resist the BOGO lunch entree coupon so we went twice to check it out.  The biscuits taste a little bit like Bisquick biscuits. But when they are served hot, it is a guilty pleasure all the same.  I would say for their lunch entrees get the BBQ lunch platter ($17ish). Just note, the portions were not very generous for the price. In general, the BBQ meats tasted kind of generic with not enough smoke to the meat. Hence, all the multiple bottles of bbq sauce on the table. It's to cover the relatively bland flavor of the meat. The best thing that we tried was the sausage links.  The sides we tried were the potato salad, the peanut slaw and the BBQ baked beans. The BBQ baked beans were probably the best side there. The peanut slaw and potato salad were both very uninteresting and I could probably do without either one of them. All the portions for these were rather small considering the price.  I tried their BBQ chicken salad entree ($10) and it was totally not worth it. Basically it consisted of a small side salad with hunks of cheddar, a few onion straws and less than 10 pieces of chicken (approximately the size of half a chicken thigh). WTF! It tasted okay but seriously could have provided a more reasonable portion. Even Weight Watcher's probably would have given you more (probably minus the cheese and the onion straws... but who's counting?)  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich ($10) was a more reasonable size but again the meat overall was pretty bland and lacked the smoky flavor.  If you're looking for some good finger lickin' BBQ, this is not really the place to hit. The food here is okay but if you factor in the price/portion ratio it is pretty expensive for what it is. Unless you have a BOGO lunch coupon from Red Rock, I'd probably skip this joint (2.5 starred review).",

There were 2 other parties that were seated probably 20-30 min after us and they got their food before us which was really frustrating!!! We spoke to the manager and he gave us a crap load of excuses about how the waiters were confused on who was supposed to have our table (barely giving us a hands to speak). He comped $25 off our bill but after all the wait and mediocre food, I'll never come back to this place. It's not worth it!",

    "text": "We decided to try Lucille's tonight with take out.  I did an online order this morning for pick up at 4:30 PM.  I was ten minutes early and it was ready yet which is good because it wasn't made ahead of time and sitting somewhere.  The online ordering was a big plus!!  I got an original pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  My wife got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of garlic mashed.  One of the problems with what I got was simply the fact that it's take out.  I live nearby, but pulled pork isn't boiling hot when it's placed in the bun and therefore it wasn't a hot sandwich and in fact wasn't warm.  Luke warm would be closer to the temperature of the meat.  The mac and cheese stayed warm.  I thought the sandwich was dry even though the menu says it's tossed in their special sauce.  Maybe I should have asked for some BBQ sauce to go.  There was no toss that I could discern.  The mac and cheese was very good.  My wife liked her sandwich although she thought it was very spicy hot.  She liked the garlic mashed side.  I guess I'm just not a BBQ person.  Nothing about BBQ blows my socks off.  If I came back to Lucille's, it would be for a dinner of mac and cheese.  I'll take international cuisines or a good steak before I'd get this.  There's one other BBQ place I need to try before I put a nail in my BBQ coffin and lower it in the ground.  The price/value just isn't there.  But, Lucille's is OK--Just.",

I'm not a fan of smoked (anything) but they put just the right amount of smoke in the Q that I don't feel like I myself am inhaling the smoke directly from the smoker. Their Memphis BBQ sauce is what makes it for me. I hearts me some garlic and that sauce has the right amount of everything!  Another one of the \"hooray\" moments I had was when they told us that they had unsweetened flavored teas, WHAT?! I dislike sweet tea, a lot. If I want a pound of sugar in my water, I'll ask for syrup. And most places have flavored tea but it's always sweetened and me no likey. They have watermelon, peach, regular and sweet tea.   They have a nice backyard BBQ theme and have a stage in the \"Flying Pig Lounge\" which leads me to believe that they intend to use it one day for a live band. It'd be pretty cool to come in for a live band or even a comedy show :)  After the failed restaurants in this space, I hope this one sticks around!",

But apparently they need the business & thus have their servers promoting all menu items to the point of ad nauseum... would you like Sangria with that?  How about a larger portion?  Are you sure you don't want any dessert?  Otherwise, efficient.    I ordered the tri-tip salad and my partner the gumbo.  It was long in coming, though not very busy during our time there (1:00-2:00).  The chef must have dumped a half cup of salt into that gumbo because it was not edible, so he ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  It didn't come til' I was done with my salad & unfortunately fell apart in his hands because of a too-old crumbly bun (which he ate anyway, out of hunger).  It had cheese on top which I'd not seen on a BBQ sandwich.  My salad had 4 very thin slices of not espec. tantalizing tri-tip & a sweet dressing over gourmet greens w/red & yellow bell peppers & red onion slivers.  Even those divine biscuits with honey butter could not make up for the lunch faux pas, & the noisy blues music which needed a full dose of Keb Mo and Eric Bibb to SOOTHE my soul.",

They had a table ready for us earlier. However, we refused it, so we had to wait the 45 minutes.   Once we were seated, everything flowed like clockwork.  The ambiance is very nice. The restaurant is well decorated, clean, and holds a lot of people.  The food was very good. I ordered spare ribs, with mashed potatoes, and veggies. My wife had Beef ribs, and was very satisfied. I've had better veggies before, but nobody goes to a BBQ restaurant for the veggies.  The prices were very reasonable. I expected to spend way more than we actually did.  The service is outstanding! Every employee we encountered were all very friendly, and helpful. Our server was on top of refilling our beverages, checking on us, and brought our food out in a very timely manner.  I would definitely go to Lucille's again!",

The mojito is sweet and minty. Very good.  We ordered the beef ribs: good and smokey but fatty. Tri tips were tender and delicious, highly recommended. We ordered roasted peanut slaw which complemented the BBQ, and some veggies as well. I advise to skip the salad, very ordinary and expensive for extra $5.99.   The bread pudding is huge, and one of the better ones I've tasted. It will be dry without the sauce, which was very yummy by the way with a hint of orange zest and nutty flavor.   Service is slow, food took a while to be served, it's a good thing there's a live band.  Our server was attentive and nice and kept checking on us throughout our meal.  Overall, great experience and highly recommended",

Our server was very attentive and knew the menu. He had great recommendations for our taste preference. I hade the jalapeno spicy burger and my spouse had the bacon burger. Both burgers were outstanding to say the least. We started with the on the house butter biscuits too, they had sugar on top and tasted like heaven. We pretty much went into a food coma after this night out.   Check this place out you will NOT be disappointed!!!!   Oh and try the spicy BBQ hot sauce they sell, I took two home, yum and yum, I love spicy and this hit the spot.",

Greeted by about 4 youngsters and when I told them I was there for a party and gave them a name I was asked \"party of two. Uh no did I just not say I was meeting a party of people. I gave the name again they gave me a different name and said the table was getting ready. As we waited I got a call that my group was already inside and has been for 30 minutes. Needless to say the apps that were ordered we're already cold. Ordered the tri tip salad. Uhhhh 3 small slices of tri tip in a huge head of greens is not a salad to me. Best part of the meal was the company. Not impressed and I wouldn't call this Bar-B-Que either. You don't cook a piece of meat toss some sauce on it and call it Bar-B-Que. save time money and pass this place up",

Manager has come by and removed the item right away from the bill and did offer to bring me something else but by that time I was disgusted and honestly I really doubted that there was any quality control. This plate never should have been served and I figured anything would have same issues.   We have been here before as we live right nearby but after this visit we won't be coming back.   Service was nice and manager was polite and nice but the lack of quality control and concern for what was being put on a plate shows serious kitchen issues.   Very disappointing.",

The four of us were quickly seated in orders were taken. I ordered the barbecue bacon burger and an appetizer of onion straws.  The onion straw appetizer was deliciously crunchy and micro cut into slivers of deliciousness. I'm usually not a hamburger eater but this burger was so delicious I ate until my stomach was full and I was uncomfortably stuffed!  The burger came with a side of crunchy homemade coleslaw which was delicious all in itself.  Maybe I shouldn't of ate so many onion straws!  I recommend this place for anyone to try when in the Red Rock area.",

    "text": "For Thanksgiving this year my husband and I decided to take the easy route, and ordered the Thanksgiving family feast from Lucille's. While there were no complaints about the actual food, the overall experience left a lot to be desired.   Disappointment #1: When I tried to order from the other Lucille's and I was told they were sold out. I don't reside on this side of town so I very rarely go to any of the businesses at Red Rock, but since I had no other option I placed my order with this location. I was asked if I wanted plates and silverware, and told my pickup time.   Disappointment #2: Over the phone I was told I could utilize the parking spots reserved for customers picking up to go orders. When I arrived, these spots were taken. (When I left, they were still taken by the same vehicles, clearly not people there to pick up to go orders). These spots are pointless. I ended up parking quite a distance from Lucille's which wouldn't have been THAT terrible except...  Disappointment #3: After I paid for my feast, I was asked by an employee if I needed assistance, which in hindsight I think should have been obvious that I would need help carrying the very large and heavy box of food out to my car. However the employee was simply offering to open the door for me. The lack of basic customer assistance was a bit mind boggling, other Lucille's customers that were leaving as I struggled to maneuver the box out to my car even commented how they thought someone should have helped me.   Disappointment #4: The plates and silverware I was asked if I needed? Nowhere to be found. Not a huge deal, but why offer it if you will not be following through?  After enjoying the food and company of friends on Thanksgiving, I considered posting this review but decided instead to write to Lucille's corporate directly. I received a phone call from a manager who apologized and said she hoped I'd give them another shot. While I do appreciate that time was taken to contact me, I do not forsee me spending more of my money at Lucille's anytime soon.",

Gotta love that sweet tea! I love the big Mason jars the drinks are served in. Had a Moscow mule first and it was on point.  I always order the same thing; full rack of baby backs, fully loaded baked potato,  and Mac and cheese. And of course it's always tasty and delicious.  5 stars for everyone!",

No way I was saying no!  We got seated quickly and the TV's had the typical sports on it. :(  Our waiter was nice and let us have a right amount of time to over look our menu. The drink glasses were huge! I was not going to bother my server for a refill..   The only complaint about this restaurant was it was way to COLD. They had the A/C blasting... my hair was waving in the wind and all.   I couldn't wait to eat to get warmed up..  BBQ Tri Tip was my choice. Angus Beef tri tip, and served with the savory mop sauce. The food looked good, and tasted good. Meat was tender, so you know they were cooking it for hours. Loved it!   Another amazing BBQ restaurant!!",

The bad: the weird greasy spread they give you with the biscuits. It is always waxy and not very flavorful.  It seems like they use cheap margarine. The hot links - too much garlic in my opinion, but I haven't had them in ages. Service can be iffy.",

    "text": "Been wanting to go to the Lucille's in Green Valley Ranch for the longest time, but it's just so far away.  Was happy to hear Lucille's would be opening much closer to my neck of the woods at Red Rock Casino.  Finally visited on my stepdaughter's 21st birthday for dinner.  Gotta say right off the bat...not very impressed.  I mean, for all the fancy decor, just average BBQ?  I have no need for that.  I know it's a chain (and a big one at that) but I don't really care for a pleasant atmosphere usually, for me it's about taste and portions!  Especially with BBQ.  I don't mind eating in a po-dunk, out-back, no-utensils kinda place if the que' is legendary.  Really, I don't.  Lucille's just isn't that kind of place.  But at least they use mason jars for your drinks!  After being seated (and boy was the place packed) we went straight to menu lookin'.  After ordering our drinks-in-mason-jars (makes me wish I got moonshine) we started off with an appetizer of BBQ Pork Nachos.  They arrived after about 20 minutes and looked really good.  Nacho chips topped with smoked BBQ pork, BBQ sauce, cheese (some shredded, some that was more like canned nacho cheese), black beans, pico de gallo, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole.  This dish was actually pretty good and hit on all the right spots - crunchy, gooey, smoky, salty, crispy, tangy, sweet, warm, and cool.  Flavor was great with the smoke coming from the BBQ pork, very well complemented.  These nachos were just enough to whet our appetite for our main courses.  We had to wait for our actual dinner courses longer than we did for our appetizer (I was assuming good que' takes some time).    The birthday girl had the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich.  Angus beef smoked, with portabello mushrooms, red onions, jack cheese, and garlic mayo on thick slices of sourdough.  It was a good sandwich, and that garlic mayo gave it a nick kick.  They messed up on her side of fries though, so a new order had to be brought out.    The little one ordered from the kids menu and had the quarter rack of Finger Licken' BBQ Ribs with a side of macaroni & cheese.  What kid doesn't like mac & cheese?  Mine does.  But this one from Lucille's?  Not on par at all.  It was watery, and not very cheesy, in fact it was pretty bland.  Hardly cheese-tastic at all.  I mean she's not too picky, and loves the fake stuff from the blue box!  So for her not to finish this mac & cheese was a big statement.  She did like her ribs though, but the serving was just too small and she was left hungry (even after the nachos).    The wifey had probably the best dish of the night, 5 bones of the BBQ Beef Ribs.  Make room, cause the suckers are HUGE!  Like mini-dinosaur bones!  The beef ribs are rubbed, slow-smoked, then finished off on the grill with Lucille's original BBQ sauce.  I had one and they were GOOD.  Meaty, cooked long enough so the meat comes off the bone with just a little bit of give.  Smoky for sure, and good with the BBQ sauce finish.  Her sides?  She wasn't impressed.  The sweet potato fries were just ok, and the Southern Braised Greens were lacking.  Either not cooked long enough or not enough flavor added to the pot, there were super bland.  I wasn't jumping for joy with my dish, the St. Louis Spare Ribs.  I don't mind Baby Back Ribs, but they are way too small looking for a guy like me.  I want more meat, so give me the bigger rib!  My order came out and I was like 'Huh?'  Didn't I order St. Louis style?  I asked our waitress and she said they were St. Louis.  I'm no expert, but either these were Baby Back Ribs and you were lying to me, or you cut the ends of my St. Louis ribs way too short.  Where are the ends of my ribs?  Look at the pic your self and see.  I felt ripped off to say the least.  If they tasted good I guess it would have made up for it.  But these 'St. Louis' ribs were not the best I've had.  They were dry, and the smoke on them were barely noticeable.  The BBQ sauce on them didn't help either, all it did was coat them in what was now too-sweet ribs.  Disappointing.  I can finish off a rack of ribs myself, but I saved half of these for home.  I think the worst thing we had though was Lucille's homemade 'biscuits'.  Very confused.  These are not biscuits.  Nor are they really rolls.  What the hell are they?  And why are they covered in cinnamon and sugar?  Just plain odd, and not the most tasty biscuits I've ever had.  You guys should just call it a day and go back with Biscuit Basics 101 - Flour+Buttermilk+Lard=BISCUIT.  If it's good enough for the South it's good enough for the rest of us.  Service got spotty after our entrees arrived.  Our waitress was far in between on service, had to ask multiple times for refills on drinks even as she passed right by us.  Seems she was catering to a larger table nearby.  Prices are kinda high for Lucille's, around high $20s for a rack of ribs with sides.  Luckily we had an Xmas present of $100 gift card, which we used all of.  EH.  OK.",

As far as food goes theres only a couple things that i look forward to when i eat here. Beef Ribs & St Louis Ribs and sometimes when im really hungry ill order a mardi gras chicken to go. The biscuits and apple butter is always a great bite.  The only bad side is the smoking from the casino does come into the dining room so i guess that will be the reason i go to green valley over this location. but food is always consistent",

I asked if happy hour was still on and the man said no, then the sweet lady said it was and that we would be able to take advantage of it in the bar area AND still have Santiago, SCORE!  We were sat next to the water in front of Red Rock, so it was super nice! As the night went on it got a bit chilly, but we were ok.  Im going to keep this short, out waiter was an idiot and didnt listen to us whilst taking our order and messed up half of it. We then politley asked for it to be corrected and he AGAIN didnt pay attention so we ended up having an incorrect order. THEN we askd a waitress for a set of tableware and she looked at us as though we were asking for a million dollars, then only reason we asked was because they didnt give us enough!!  The food was cold and flavorless and we were basically ignored 90% of the night due to a large party in the bar area. The supervisors and most of the waitstaff were kissing this groups behind and it was getting pathetic.  There we sat waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Cold food and all!  We asked to speak to the manager and our server gave us a dirty look and asked why? WHAT!? Why? Because I said so! Jesus! The manager was not helpful and said it was because they were still new and hadnt been opened a long time. BULLSHIT! Your servers and staff are just a bunch of arrogant morons.   The end!",

You can only order from one section of the lunch menu and the selections are limited.  The portions are extremely small, food was barely edible, slightly cold.  A quarter chicken should be more than just a leg.  You get one biscuit and if you ask for more, you get one.  The restaurant is never busy, even for happy hour, which has been going downhill for awhile.",

They completely revamped the menu. Biscuits tasted like Betty Crocker was in the kitchen, garlic bread to die for, and they have this new breaded fried chicken with gravy. Holy moly, reminded me of chicken fried steak, it was AH-MAZING! Almost all the side dishes were excellent. Although I wouldn't get the garlic mashed potatoes again. Not bad at all, but they could be better I guess.   Is it pricey? Um, plates run about $30-35 for the meat dishes. Appetizers are a bit on the pricey end up around $9-15. But it is SO worth it!   A+++ Service!!! Our waitress was excellent. She could of not done a better job.",

Booths, tables and high tops were all available as far as seating. There is also a bar and I'm pretty sure you can order food at the bar as well.  I was there for an early dinner on a Monday it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. Menus were dropped off and our server was at our table almost right away with drink orders.  The food was very good. I had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger with fries as a side though you can have other options, like veggies or a baked potato. The burger was huge too, I had to cut it in half which for me is always a good sign. The burnt ends were delicious as well which came with a piece of watermelon too. Three types of BBQ sauce right at the table. They have their own brand. I didn't try all three but the hot option was pretty good.  This place isn't anywhere near the strip but it is and was definitely worth the trip.",

Went her for a friend who was celebrating a b-day, made reservations and told them ahead of time that we would be bringing presents inside in a bag and asked them to surprise her with a cake and candle and I was on edge to see if they would follow through.  Ordered sweet tea which comes in these big mason jar glasses, they are HUGE and delicious.     Ordered Fried green tomatoes, I have always wanted to but my friend Polly said that they would be gross but I didnt want to leave the restaurant without a taste so I ordered them and the sausage trio, I didnt care as much for the sausage but thats just I believe because I am slowly switching around my eating habits--The friend green tomatoes were good but I dont know that I would order them again...  Polly ordered a full rack of ribs and she said they were amazing, Susan ordered Half chicken w/2 meats and she loved that and I had Texas brisket w/garlic potatoes, cheesy grits and that was amazing...  Dessert was banana pudding for me which was good...Not spectacular as advertised but alright, Susan ordered snickers pie which was delicious and Yep they brought out a slice of chocolate cake for Polly with a candle, I was super happy and impressed.  $110 for all that we ate and Yes, we will be back but as I said, not very often, I have lost 19 pounds and want to keep going, somehow I dont see this restaurant as productive in that goal   ;)     Watch me go there next week, haha",

Mine were a little hard by the time they got home and not as good as they could have been.  Everything else was divine!

The place was nice and clean and we were there mid-afternoon on a Sunday so it was fairly empty, maybe 4-5 other tables had people. We were a party of 5. The male host was bored apparently and decided to walk us all around the restaurant to our table in the back, past many empty tables.  Our server came over shortly after for our drink orders, but took forever to bring 2 bottles of Angry Orchard long after all the rest of the drinks arrived. The food was good but sorry no pics this time for them.  Why this is 4/5 stars is our server decided to continuously bus our table to the point of repeatedly interrupting conversations. Now I don't mind you taking plates that are done but he was there at our table more than the most attentive server should be, as he wasn't helping anything. The table wasn't full of plates and glasses and he could've left it alone until we left. It was like he was rushing us when they weren't busy; we literally got there at 3 and were rushed out to leave by 4:15. Barbecue shouldn't be fast eaten food. On top of that, he brings the check and then ignored the credit card sticking out of it for more than 5 times that he came back to the table to pull all items from it.  He ruined the birthday song by constantly being in frame for all photos. Like, seriously, we aren't celebrating your service, we are celebrating someone's birthday. I'd avoid this server and that's why I'm posting his pic.",

    "text": "The kind of place that everyone can find something to chow down on, Lucille's BBQ is popular with my extended family.  With a party of 11, we came here last night for my cousins' birthday dinner at their choosing.  Located at Red Rock Casino, there is a separate entrance to the restaurant so you don't even have to enter the casino unless you have to use the restroom because there aren't any in Lucille's. Reservations were made in advance and we were seated at a long table that accommodated all of us quite easily.  I've been to this location before with friends who also chose it for a celebration, it may have been a birthday, too, but I don't remember.  What I do like about this place is that the service is excellent.  I want to give a special shout-out to Miles, the staff member who was assigned to our table last night.  This guy took care of our larger group from beginning to end and was especially attentive to my littlest cousins who sat at one end of the table together.  Miles took their orders, crouching down to speak to them at their level and treated them, 7 and 9 year olds, with as much courtesy as he did the adults.    As for the food, the menu is the huge kind with loads of choices.  We started off with their biscuits and apple butter that came out fresh and hot.  They're hard to resist so why try?  I had the BBQ half chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries.  Between the chicken, some of the mashed potatoes, plus a biscuit, it was more than enough food for me and it was all good.  My son ate the fries which he requested because his pulled pork sandwich only came with one side and he wanted more.  Miles checked on us often and everyone had a satisfying meal. When I asked him to take a group picture of us at the end, Miles wanted to clear some of the table off first so it didn't look so trashed plus he took more than one picture:  this guy knows what he's doing.  I would definitely recommend this location if you're a fan of Lucille's for the wonderful service and hearty food.",

Service was very good. Seated fast and the food came out sooner than I had expected.  Sometimes it's the little things: instead of those stupid little wet wipes in foil packages they brought out a full-blown warm wash rag. That was a great touch.  And best of all, this was probably one of the most reasonably priced full rack of ribs I've ever eaten.",

The ribs were tender, the chicken was flavor-able, the ribs tips were good, the pulled chicken was great, the coleslaw was good (I like mine creamy), the corn on the cob was delicious.  The only thing we did not like was the mac and cheese.  The shrimp and corn fritters was just okay.   The service was great from the host, the person who sitted us, the server, and even the manager came by. We are definitely planning on returning.",

    "text": "Could have been a five star review and probably will be on my next visit, but 4 for now. The reasons for the lost of a star are the air conditioning is super cold in there. Not normally a problem, but there doesn't  seem to be any spots in the back dining room to escape the AC. This is a problem, because the food gets cold quickly once it hits the table. The 2nd issue was the Baby back ribs were a little on the dry side. Good flavor, but maybe just a little well done. With that out of the way, this was still a positive 4 star experience.  Service was something to be seen in person. Great model of how to service your guest. Ordered the sample appetizer platter. The tri tips were outstanding! As well as every item on the platter.  The entree was the 2 meat combo. It included the already mentioned baby back ribs and Brisket. The Brisket was top notch. Sides were authentically good too. They were cheese grits and collard greens. They look to have a really good happy hour too. There's no doubt in my mind the next time will be 5 star! So happy to have Lucille's in Summerlin!",

The wait can be long if you come on a weekend night, but give them your number and you'll get a text when they're ready. Or better yet make a reservation. You inhale a lot of second hand smoke if they seat you near the casino side. That's my one complaint. But the other side smells like barbecue heaven.

The Good:  Service was decent Chicken wings & onion rings were very good Side salad was decent  The Bad:  We ordered a full rack of St. Louis Spare Ribs. They appeared tasty we each cut a few off and took a few bites. Something was just not right. The best way I can explain the taste is if you were to dump a ton of lighter fluid over a charcoal grill and use it immediately after. We spoke with the manager and she agreed to bring another rack of ribs. This time baby rack - Maybe it was just a single occurrence? They had the same exact flavor. Something is broken. They confirmed something was not right. Not sure how everyone else was just eating away. They comped the full meal ($15) of sides and we left feeling sick and with a headache. Extremely disappointed.

The biscuit was soft, fluffy, and melted in my mouth. They are sweet and I was not expecting that, but it's not overboard. They manager on duty  (Trevor or Troy...

Unfortunately I pulled a star because this may be one of the most expensive BBQ places in Vegas.  Worth a visit, but can't make it a habit.",

The evening started out a little slow, but once our server got to us (he had a large 7 top so he was busy) we were going full speed. Even the other servers that were just passing by were super attentive. Making sure we had been helped while we were waiting for our drinks. Boyfriend had the speciality old fashioned and it was tasty, I got the cucumber gimlet, not as strong as I had hoped but still very smooth, tasty and easy to drink. We tried the appetizer sample and everything on it was super tasty. Then he had a wedge salad and I have a cup of their corn chowder. So goooood. For the entree he had the Mardi Gras chicken and I had the Louisiana pasta both of these were great! Couldn't finish our food so we got the rest Togo and then ordered another round of drinks. Had a gin martini and it was spot on. Ordered the s'mores pudding for dessert to split. Also great. I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. Will be back!",

We ordered some extra fried okra which was excellent. The disappointment came when the main meals came out and one of the meals was wrong. The waiter quickly said it wasn't his fault but the kitchens. Ultimately I don't care whose fault it was but that it is corrected. Playing the blame game is not the best look for a restaurant. They did pretty quickly get out the right meal and gave my father a free dessert for the error. I want to love this place because the food is always good but the service just always seems to have issues.",

As soon as we got our table the server asked if we needed something to drink from there we waited. I noticed she made us wait for a while before she even offered if we wanted appetizer. She went ahead help the bigger table before we got to order our meal not only that she didn't even asked or check on us to see if we where ok but she was focused on the bigger table which I totally understand. Good was great and everything we always tip the server big because they are usually attentive but this time around I really didn't want to tip her but I felt bad so I still have her a bit. Sometimes you gotta pay attention and treat people equal because who know the person will tip you more.",

He would come up and get half the drink orders and then walk away, and come back later to get the rest. He walked around the table and sporadically asked for people's dinner orders, which left 2 of my friends without putting in an order. We had almost all the appetizers and most of them are good. I tried the ribs and they were okay. The sauce is too sweet for my taste. My order didn't come out with everyone else's. The waiter said that it was still being prepared... it was a salad. All in all, it's a good atmosphere, the service needs work and the food flavors are very sweet, which is good for some pallets, just not my own.",

    "text": "So, it ain't great. It ain't terrible. There's a reason why chain restaurants are what they are. I've been here a few times, and it's just what it is. Consistent, decent food. Service is relatively consistent. However, never have had a horrible experience. Yet, the last time I went, it was really off. Two of us ordered drinks from the bar & I swear, no exaggeration, it took them about 20-30 minutes to get us a beer & a margarita. Then, it took them 58 minutes to bring us our food; I only know this cause the Manager shared that with us while discussing the issue. Then once the food arrived, they switched my order with someone else at the table. When I caught it, they were quick to take care of it. However, I ended up canceling my order all together because I was afraid my food wouldn't make it back out until everyone at my table was done. Just a big ol mess! Upside, our Server was super cool even during the disaster. However, I never blamed her for what happened. I mentioned to the Manager that she was great the entire time and he should double check the kitchen, the expeditors and the food runners. The Manager was an upside too. He immediately ran over to us, offered to rectify the situation. And when I asked him to cancel my order, he brought over the incorrect item in a to go bag & suggested that because they're just going to throw it away, if I wanted , I could have it. I politely declined. He then offered to give us dessert on the house however everyone else was too full & over it by this time, that we respectfully declined.  Again, it's a chain. They do what their formula tells them to do. The food ain't bad. Service has always been good. Just this one time was a mess. I won't go running back, but it's there.  FYI... After a couple of hours of posting this, the owner of Lucille's, Brad, reached out to me via a DM. I REALLY appreciate when an owner takes pride as he did. SO I am changing it from a 2 star to a 3 star review. Again, THANKS Brad!!",

The wait was supposed to be 15 minutes, but we were seated after 30 minutes. The restaurant was maybe 2/3 full and the service was super slow. I ordered the \"Famous\" Banana Pudding and the hubby got the 1/2 chicken and two meats with two sides. He liked his food with the exception of a random piece of zucchini in his pulled pork. I had asked for my Banana Pudding to come out ASAP since my blood sugar was low. It didn't come out til my husband was halfway through his meal even though I ordered it as soon as we sat down. The waiter apologized and said that the first one fell on the floor and they had to make a new one. That happens, I get it...but it doesn't take 30 minutes to put together a new Banana Pudding. What I wasn't crazy about was this: 1- the pudding was at room temperature - which tasted really weird. 2- I asked for them to go light on the whipped cream, but it was served with tons of whipped cream. 3- there were only two tiny banana slices on top of the whipped cream and none in the actual dessert. Any other banana pudding I've ever gotten had bananas in the mix.  Overall, I still can't recommend this place. The waiters have no energy, the food is served without pride and I don't think the food justifies the prices charged.",

    "text": "The worst food poisoning experience I ever encountered I experienced following a trip to Lucilles!    I was there November 3rd for Monday night football and as it was a little chilly outside I decided to have some corn chowder soup.   The waiter who took our order was brand new as the woman behind him mentioned that as he took our order.  I got the soup with cornbread and should have said something about how it wasn't that hot and tasted a little off.   The way he served it with an uncertain look should have been a sign.    That night I encountered the worst level of food poisoning ever which carried for a few days. I will spare the review from being descriptive but I don't wish my worst enemy to experience what i went thru.     When I finally had enough energy to call them (not being able to eat anything at all for days) i called to speak to the manager who rushed me to expect a call from HR later that day.   It was a day later and instead of asking if I'd like to see a doctor, she told me she would call in a few days.   That never happened and instead I got a gift card from them....    I wouldn't consider going back and called the HR woman telling her how disgusted I was on how sending a gift card was there way of handling after throwing up for days and being as sick as I was (I should have been in the hospital).  She said I would get called over the next day or two by her supervisor as well as the insurance company...   Her supervisor never called and today the insurance company called and basically told me they wont do anything making me feel like a victim with all their questions.    I tried calling to speak to the owner, got the HR person again and I'm done feeling like a victim.   I've contacted the board of health based on getting food poison following being there and if you also got food poisoning following going to Lucilles I'd recommend you do the same!    If I could give negative stars I would!",

    "text": "After leaving my last review on Lucille's, I was almost immediately contacted by Brad (Owner) who assured me that the less than spectacular visit we had was not the norm and he encouraged us to give them another try.  Well we did and this visit was a far better experience than our first, but not perfect.  We arrived and found it to be quite busy which was no big deal since we were told it would only be about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  The hit this mark right on the money, but our seat would not have been our first choice, it was right by the kitchen which meant we got to deal with the traffic of servers during our meal.  It would have been nice if they asked if this was satisfactory, I would have gladly waited a few more minutes for a better table.  We were both hungry so we dealt with it.  Now for the food.  We thought it would be best if we ordered at least some of the food we had the first time.  My wife went with the brisket which like the first time was tender but did not have the smoky flavor one looks for when eating barbecue and again the potato was on the small side. Overall it was good, but not great.  I went with the burnt ends and tri-tip.  The tri-tip was again outstanding and very flavorful.  The burnt ends were far better than the first time.  They were still cut small, but this time were very tender and a joy to eat.  They, like the brisket, could have used a bit more smoke.  This visit was far more enjoyable than our first visit.  I still think they are a bit overpriced especially since there are other barbecue joints in town who's food is as good at a much better price.  Would we return?  Probably.",

I think there are still some teething problems but still somewhere I would return and happy that they were able to sort any problems we had.   Previous post -  Very strange experience, we walked in and waited for a host, a young guy approached us and we asked for a table for two. He didn't say anything just picked up some menus and gestured to us to follow him. On the way to the table a server asked him a question and he stopped and then they had a conversation for a while and it was just awkward for us waiting for them to finish their conversation. He showed us our table and threw down the menus and cutlery in a rage, muttered something under his breath and then walked off. It was my husbands birthday and we both felt disappointed before we even down. We decided quickly that it was extremely off putting and just walked out which nether of us have done before but we just didn't feel welcome. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "Took me forever to try this place ! I go to redrock often to gamble, not so much to eat. I had to get an iPhone fixed, instead of finding food in downtown Summerlin , my boyfriend and I chose to go to Lucille's.   I see a lot of reviews on the host/greeter. There were two people upfront, I think one was in training. Not very smiley, but they sat us immediately.   I love the design of the restaurant! It's like you're sitting outside, there's fake tress and the kitchen looks like a restaurant and what not. They smoke the meat inside !   Our server Anthony, was nice. He took care of us, nothing too special. He answered some of my questions and wasn't rude about it.   First we ordered our drinks which were an IPA beer and I ordered a blue bayou, which was a coconut tequila, 1800 reposado,  blue and blackberries, margarita type drink. When you order the Blue Bayou, a dollar supports the cause for autism. The drink was DELICIOUS. When we got our drinks, he also brought out some biscuits, I believe ? It was so delicious! It wasn't as moist. But it was still good. They also had some kind of whipped apple cinnamon butter ? I don't know what it was, but it was tasty. It's sweet, so I ended up eating it last, as a dessert. Kind of wish I had more .   My boyfriend has ordered babyback rib lunch with collard greens, and I ordered 2 meat combo, which was burnt tips, pulled pork and Mac n cheese. The rib and the tips were bomb !!!! The pulled pork, not so much.. I find it kind of dry. Mac n cheese is normal, but the collared greens were yuck. It was so mushy. It reminded me of an Asian vinegar veggie dish that sat in a pot for a long time, so it became mush. I was a little disappointed.   Up side , they have 3 sauces on the table! I love sauce, so I put hot sauce into the greens. It tastes a little better.   Another thing, I posted a pic of my dish.. I know bbq food isn't really \"pretty\", but my plate looked like I got it from a cafeteria . It looked like someone scooped the meat. It's all in the middle, I had so much space on my plate, the presentation isn't as nice like other bbq joints.   Prices are reasonable. 2 dishes(15.99&10.99) , 2 drinks(can't remember the prices), for lunch we spent about 48$ not including tip.   We also got a deal since it's autism awareness month, if you donate 5$ you get 10$ to use on your next visit (may-June only). So we opted to do that, good to donate from time to time.  Definitely going to come back for the baby back and rib tips! Not so much the greens.",

No one acknowledged me standing there, no one said hello welcome to Lucille's or even acknowledged that I was there. I greeted them. One I can say her name was Alexa. I said hello. She said hello back. Another gentleman walked by, he asked her something and they had a conversation and then she turns to me and says \"for how many?\"  I'm not new to customer service and this was by far the rudest interaction I had with someone that was supposed to be a greeter/first person you meet at a restaurant. I told her that was really rude. She apologized but still. I almost walked away to go to Yard House.   After being seated, out waiter was cool. Got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal. We asked another gentleman whom was cleaning the tables next to us to grab a hot sauce.  He said sure, left, then never came back with one. So we had to ask our waiter for one.  We ordered the Meal for two and overall, I can say I like the food but I would work on the temperature for serving things that are suppose to be hot. The meats and collard greens were luke warm. I was expecting hot food. The additional Tri Tip that we got was not moist at all. So dry.   Don't get me wrong, I like Lucille's, especially the lemonade.  My waiter was cool but between the greeter and the food, they missed 5 stars on this one.",

    "text": "So yeah, I've eaten at Lucille's many times but never had a \"wow\" meal until tonight.  We were hanging up at the Red Rock playing some poker and decided it was time to grab a bite and go home.    The hubs and I aren't crazy BBQ fans but on occasion we are down for some Southern cookin.  We decided we'd place an order at their convenient takeout counter located towards the front of the hotel (just so you have a reference point) and go home so we could binge watch and get fat together!  There was some mad crazy live music going on as the takeout counter is near the bar.  The big guy had a great voice and was fun, meaning he was getting the crowed included.  It was way to freaking loud though. Like hello....I'm trying to place my order here, ya'll!  Anyway let's get to how friendly the girl was who took my order.  I had to wait for a guy in front of me who was having payment issues then I had to wait for her to take a phone in order.  Finally it was MY turn! Hallelujah!    The order was simple.  Hubs wanted jambalaya and said it was AWESOME!  He's not so easy to please to this means a lot!  I wanted the southern fried chicken but I didn't want to deal with bones.  Guess what!???  It doesn't come with bones! It's 2 gigantic chicken breasts lightly fried and covered in gravy!  Amazing!  It was perfectly prepared.  Since this was a to go order everything came on the side.  That was great so nothing got soggy.  I asked for a baked potato instead of the garlic mashed and I'm happy I did.  That baker was so good! I asked for extra gravy, they obliged!  The entire order was prepared exactly as I had ordered and tasted so good!  Lucille's, you've out done yourself!  We will be back or better yet, we may be doing UberEATS!    Thank you for an incredible meal!",

Every Sat night in the bar they have free live blues music from 7-11 and it's nice. The musicians are good and they vary. It's not too loud either so it's enjoyable to hear during dinner.  The servers are cool and they don't hustle you too much for the up sells like certain other restaurants do (Yardhouse).  The cocktails are nice sized too and served in mugs and mason jars which goes with the theme. I always eat in the bar but the restaurant area seems good for families.",

We all ordered burgers at my table and are happy we did because there were delicious, I ordered the new bacon jam burger and the bacon was crispy which I loved and the sweetness of the bacon jam and the patty worked nicely, I do recommend getting sweet potatoes fries over there regular fries it's just better! Overall spent a great time here with my family and all left satisfied, definitely should check it out!",

    "text": "Awesome BBQ! This place is giving Phil's a run for their moneyyy in terms of sauces. First of all, the restaurant was huge and really clean. Our waitress was really nice! She even explained the 3 different type of sauces available &general info about Lucille's. She started us off with freshly baked biscuits. These were no ordinary biscuits though. Some may argue that the bread was \"hard\" but I felt that it was necessary to have them a bit sturdy rather than having them fall apart. It had butter and some type of sugar? on top. Not sure what it was but it was something different and definitely tasty! Their sweet tea was good too, all their drinks were served in mason jars btw, so hipsters rejoice. Also note that they do serve their drinks in shareable portions.   Onto the food: We got the \"BBQ Lunch Platter\" [$16]. Came with baby back ribs (3 bones, normal or St. Louis rub) AND \"your choice of two of the following: pulled pork, brisket burnt ends, tri tip, hot link, rib tips or one quarter smoked chicken\" (from the website) PLUS a side. I opted with the normal baby back ribs- juicy and fall of the bones type- & brisket as well as tri tip. All great choices! Their mac & cheese was cheeeesy just the way I like it. Tasted their potato salad too, Phil's won in that department by a long shot. Now in terms of sauces, Phil's has more of the tangy-spicy taste whereas Lucille's has the tangy-sweet taste which I liked better.. In terms of size & tenderness, I feel like Phil's is better. IN CONCLUSION: They're both great BBQ places (:",

    "text": "It was a Saturday night in Red Rock Casino and we were up for Lucille's Barbecue. So were several other people. There would be a 45 minute wait. Thanks to an innovative yet obvious system the 45 minutes would be put to good use. After the host informed us of the wait, he asked for the cell phone number. When our table was ready, he would send a text message. Lucille's just happens to be Red Rock Casino neighbors with the Yard House, an indoor theme park of beer. And when I drink a beer in the yard House, 45 minutes flies by fast and before I knew it, Lucille's Barbecue sent the text.    I had my mind set on ordering some type of hamburger sandwich. From past experiences dining in restaurants specializing in barbecue cuisine, the hamburgers are exceptional (same holds True with steak houses). After a cursory glance at the menu, the smoked beef brisket & portabello sandwich struck my eyes. I am a fan of brisket and mushrooms. After the waiter said this is one of their best sandwiches, I ordered it. Color me impressed with the sandwich. Everything from the grilled red onions to the sourdough bread was quality. The space between the sourdough buns was thick with the smoked beef brisket. Delicious smoked beef brisket that is. I appreciated that it wasn't sticky. With the sandwich, I chose shoestring fries. They were decent. And the soda that I drank was in a large glass.     Attentive and for the most part friendly servers placed the food on the table. One of the servers was attentive enough to let us know that the bread rolls were taking awhile because they were making new ones. Toward the end of the meal, one of the servers took the initiative to give us a to-go box. My one beef with the service was having to wait on ketchup.     I am impressed with Lucille's Barbecue. Especially,  when a 45 minute wait is no wait, but the freedom to have a beer in the Yard House or walk around Red Rock Casino until a text message sends the alert that the table is ready. I could see a return dinner to Lucille's Barbecue in my future.",

    "text": "For our occasional Happy Hour get-together with some of the friends in my development, we chose Lucille's this time.  It was new to six of us, and suggested by #7, who'd been there before.  I called the day before because we needed a special accommodation for one friend who's in a wheelchair.  The manager, Evan, graciously said that we could sit right outside the bar area, where there were regular tables.  But when we arrived, we were seated at a booth.  They did allow us to move, though, which was helpful when we ended up being two more than originally scheduled.  Our waitress, Barbie, started out great, but dropped the ball early.  One drink was never brought.  A water refill required two requests before it was done.  One friend had to send her burger back, but it wasn't returned until we were all nearly done eating, and then only after she corralled a different waiter to get her food.  With our drinks empty and 20 minutes to go before HH ended, we were never asked if anyone wanted another drink.  I was a little miffed that at the end, my friends decided to not only give the waitress a break, but even to go slightly above the 20% tip.  I wouldn't have stiffed her, but sure wouldn't have been that generous.  I had the Cuervo margarita, and it was very good.  One friend ordered the strawberry lemonade, and only liked it after she had them add a shot of vodka to it.  She didn't get a sense of any of it in there the way it should have been.  Now for the food:  the complimentary biscuits were good, even for this non-biscuit lover, but they didn't need the sugar sprinkled on top.  I like to save my calories for more important things.  Almost everyone ordered something different, so I got to taste most of the HH offerings.  I had gumbo and a blackened chicken quesadilla.   The gumbo was more like a stew, the thickest one I've ever eaten.  It came with a small mold of white rice on top.  It had good flavor and just the right amount of spice for me, but way too much salt.  What it didn't have was a single piece of okra and not a shrimp in sight.  A friend who also had it found one little shrimp in hers, but also no okra.  My quesadilla was okay, nothing to write home about.  Not a lot of chicken, and the chicken was barely blackened.  The one thing I can recommend is the wedge salad, ordered by another friend.  It was huge, and would have been a much better accompaniment to my gumbo.  The rib tips were dry.  Isn't this a rib place????  Glad I didn't order them.  I didn't taste the pulled pork sliders, but they looked juicy and my friend said they were.  Fried tomatoes - a new experience for the northerners among us (and that's all of us, except for the one Australian!) - were devoured happily.  Overall, Lucille's is okay, but just okay.  I don't think I'll use my gambling points to rush back.",

Beans were undercooked.  Absolutely tasted like a typical casino cafe, not the Lucille's experience we use to get at the Henderson location.  We had dinner at this location (Summerlin) a couple of years back and it was great.  We will not be back.  Clearly not worth the $117 dinner ticket.

Although it is located in Red Rock Casino, stepping into the restaurant transports you out of Las Vegas and into a swanky Southern dive.   Service was nice but definitely on the slower side, especially considering that we beat the dinner rush and it wasn't too busy yet. The meal comes with complimentary biscuits and a spiced butter. Biscuits are topped with a sugary crust and the butter is okay but didn't taste like anything to me. This is the first place I've been to that serves a sweet bread as a starter rather than a savory one.   The food was tasty. I got the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich, which has a potato bun and mustard slaw. Side of sweet potato fries. The meat was tender, though I would have preferred a regular coleslaw instead of the mustard one. Boyfriend got the half chicken with brisket and rib tips. His was good as well, with the chicken being the most flavorful out of the three meats.   Price-wise, it's on the expensive side, probably because of the casino location. If you were to bring your family, it's not the easiest on the wallet, but the quality of the food and the portion sizes make Lucille's a decent dining option at Red Rock.",

Their sides as well as their bread with cinnamon butter are delicious, but I'm not in love with the BBQ burger. It was rather dry and the flavor was just ok. Their bacon is not crispy and was overwhelming in taste because it was cut super thick. I also had a tri tip sandwich here. The tri tip was decent with good moisture.  Obviously BBQ is going to be heavy, so no big deal there. I feel like Lucille's is rather pricey though, so I'd rather hit up places like Rollin' Smoke or Jessie Rae's as it's more the meat than the place that you're paying for.  Edit: The owner/manager of the Lucille's did contact me and informed me that they'd like me back for another try. I do appreciate this kind of customer service, and while I probably still won't return, I do think it's worth mentioning that they were kind enough to reach out to me.",

    "text": "I remember when there's was only one Lucille's in Vegas. It was in Henderson, which was really far from our house, so we never went there. Our go-to place for BBQ was Famous Dave's. One thing that's better at Lucille's is that they had beef and pork ribs and Famous Dave's didn't. Once we heard that a location of Lucille's was opening at Red Rock Hotel, which was nearby our house we wanted to go. Now I will tell you my experience...       Me and my family first walked in during dinner time, the service was pretty kind. Then we got seated in 4-5 minutes and our table was clean. After looking through the menu everything looked and sounded so yummy. Our kind waiter came in asking what drinks we wanted, there was a good amount of drink choices. The drinks were pretty good then we ordered. We waited around 10-15 minutes for our food and it was very very yummy. The food costed a normal price, but if you want to save money and have a Costco membership I have a tip for you.       So, right across the street is Costco, when you go inside head to the gift cards. Then buy the gift card which is 45-49 dollars (forgot) for two twenty five dollar gift card. Then buy it and use it at the restaurant, you just saved some money!       Also I should mention, you should park outside. Lucile's has a entrance outside, it's right next to Yard House.",

After a previous review of not being pleased with the service I received at their establishment, they sent me a complimentary card to give them another chance. I took them up on this opportunity a few days ago with a good friend, and what a difference.  Our server was phenomenal!  Very attentive, courteous, happy, and genuinely seemed like a good person.  Promptly took our orders, let us know about the specials they had going on, and did everything with a smile.  Thanks to Christina I will be coming back to this place again.  The food was good as always, but the service always makes it taste better.",

    "text": "Since moving to Vegas, whenever the topic of BBQ comes up, someone always mentions Lucille's.  Despite being very close to the District location, I never made the trip.  Recently I was up at Red Rock Casino around lunch time and thought it was time to try some Lucille's.  Since it was a casual lunch and we didn't want to spend forever in the dining room, we opted to sit at the bar.  Normally we sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table, but this was about 1145am on a Saturday and there were maybe 20 other diners - in other words, it was empty.  The bartender took our order soon enough.  She was knowledgeable, she was pleasant, she tried to up-sell us on a few things.  She offered us biscuits but not in a manner that suggested they were complimentary (or apparently delicious); it seemed like the last in a long string of up-sell.  Our food eventually came and was decent.  It was not the best BBQ I have ever had.  It wasn't the best BBQ I have had in Vegas.  It was good and satisfying but that's about the extent of it.  DC's mac and cheese was a pitiful attempt at mac and cheese.  It was stringy and mushy and flavorless.  His chicken sandwich, ordered with ranch dressing on the side, also came with a healthy slathering of ranch on the sandwich itself.  The bartender checked on us once, right as we were taking our first bite.  Despite that fact that she was never more than ten feet from us, she never checked in again.  In fact, the only time she acknowledged us again was when we were laughing at something on the TV and she turned around and asked \"what's so funny? are you laughing at me?\"  It was an odd question to ask and a little off-putting.  I'm not always the nicest person but I dont laugh out loud at someone when he or she is within arm's reach.  All told it was just a mediocre experience at Lucille's.  The food was alright.  The service was questionable (especially since it was quite empty).  I may still have to give the Henderson location a try, but I will keep on moving past the Red Rock version.",

After my order was taken I never saw my waitress again.  Instead I had to listen to the other server complaining about tips from her tables and only interested in dropping off checks to get people out of here so she could leave. All I ask is you get my order right and keep my refills going. I have 3 waitresses passed by my section repeatedly not one of them asked if they could get me a refill even though I pushed my empty drink all the way to the edge of the table repeatedly. NO team service in this environment at all here. You can complain about not getting tips on you get horrible service this coming from a person has been a restaurant manager for 15 years and work for the lights of Fleming's Steakhouse and other celebrity chefs in town.  I'm pretty low maintenance I won't bother you but if you can't even get me a refill and check on me once and all I hear is you complaining we got a problem.",

    "text": "Second visit here at Lucille's Red Rock and under awed with the cooking, again.   First time here, a Saturday night, I had a dinner salad with tri tip and way too much long-sliced scallions (onion). Whole thing was drenched in dressing making it just taste bleh.    This time was a Wednesday, lunch special (3pm), stuffed baked potato with beef. Way hard to cut potato even using a steak knife (no joke) and the beef was chewy / rubbery, even under melted cheese - they left potato on warmer / heat lamp too long. Also, way too much long-sliced scallions as garnish. Why not offer chives as an additional pay-for option?  Tried Lucille's beer sampler this time and only their version of wheat beer paired well with any of the food, in spite of what alcohol menu & server said. Three other samples (blonde, and ??) were each very bitter.   Also, just an FYI, happy hour prices are only in the bar. They'd make more money if they allowed happy hour prices in the whole restaurant, like other Las Vegas chain restaurants.   On positive note, the server apologized for both my kid's meals coming out ten minutes (not exaggerating) after my wife's & my plates. The fries had sat out too long & got soggy, so they had to fry up another batch.  I never make a fuss in a restaurant, as I've worked in the industry. I'll go back one more time, as my kids like the Mac & cheese here. We'll see how they do then.  Then, if no change, I'll just post on here and call their corporate number to check out the reviews. That'll shake up the kitchen staff and hopefully improve the quality.  By the way, I'm a huge fan of the Lucille's in Henderson. Thought all chain restaurants had the same cooking practices, food & standards?",

The shrimp were butterflied and grilled to perfection. Wish there were more than 4 pieces.  THe sweet potato mash had a hint of cinnamon! Perfect for beginning of fall :) The mac n' cheese was broiled to perfection. Size of the sides were enough for 2 people!

The manager came and spoke with us and took my entire meal off of the ticket. We have found the good service continues throughout our visits. Good chicken, fish, ribs, tri tip, and sides. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This place literally opened a few days ago!  I knew I had to rush home and write this review, so I can be the 2nd person to review this place! When searching for a  restaurant to eat at, today at work, my eyes came across this restaurant.  I'm super familiar with Lucilles BBQ and definitely feel strongly about their food.  I was super excited to try this new location out!  It's located right next to the Yard House in the Red Rock Casino.  Such a beautiful location to begin with.  When you walk in, the hostess station blocks the entire restaurant, almost creating a curious affect amongst guests.  Once you round the corner, you're taken into a backyard BBQ oasis!  Southern pictures, vintage dressers and leg lamps from Rocky Horror Picture Show adorn the restaurant. The middle focal point is definitely the bar.  Huge rectangular bar top dressed with flat screens playing sports games and other shows.  You can't help but stare at it.  The restaurant is created to look like you're on gramma's porch, then in her backyard, then in a garden and even a Bourbon style hotel.  This location is unlike any other Lucille's that I've ever been to.  SUPER COOL!  The staff.  Man, the staff is on point!  I know this location just opened, however, they are really paying attention to the detail.  The greeters are perky and friendly, the seaters wasn't afraid to strike up a conversation with us as he sat us.  Our server, Joshua, was super attentive, nice and personable.  Whatever we needed, he was there to help.  All the other servers and serving assistants, kept coming back to our table and offering any type of service that would make our experience that much better.  In fact, during dinner, I looked my party and said, \"wow, what I like is that they always come around and clear any dirty dishes so our table isn't cluttered.\"  ON POINT.  The managers, Jessica, Chila and Jeff even came by to say hi.    For dinner, we started with a full size order of the Southern Fried Dill Pickles for $6.49.  It came with 10 pickle spears, battered in spicy flour and deep fried.  This dish is accompanied with ranch dressing and creole mustard.  The batter is light and airy, the wedges aren't too sour, just right!  Juicy and delicious.  My favorite sauce, the creole mustard is flavorful and really enhances the overall taste.  Great dish.  For my meal, I got the Fried Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich for $11.99.  One of my favorite sandwiches!  Lots of small fried shrimp served on a fresh baked baguette with shredded lettuce, vine-ripened tomatoes, smoked jalapeno tartar sauce and spicy remoulade.  The shrimp was super crispy, sliced tomatoes and lettuce offered a very refreshing taste to the sandwich.  The tartar and remoulade makes you think it's spicy, but certainly not.  The combination of both sauces really takes this sandwich to a whole new level.  It's a huge sandwich and will definitely fill you up!  Between the food, biscuits and apple butter, and mason jars, this place is certainly the BEST BBQ WITH THE FINEST SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY.  I'm so jealous of Summerlin residents.  I live in Henderson and frequent the District location.  This location is new, it's fresh, it's awesome!  When you're in the area, definitely check them out.  You will NOT be disappointed!!",

He finished his beer & was waiting for one of them to cash him out. He even asked one of them who was walking by & he ignored him. I left the bar to get a table and my friend was still waiting for the bartenders to cash him out while I waited for the table. When we finally got our table, we waited for a good 5 minutes before the server came, but after that she was very attentive. She was knew the menu well & was able to answer our questions. The food came out quickly & it tasted great. I got the brisket & cleaned my plate. I would definitely try this place out again.",

We went to this location on their opening day, there was barely anyone in the restaurant around 11:00 AM, yet it took an hour to receive our food.  When we did finally get the food, there were lipstick prints on my friend's glass (none of us wore lipstick), which was absolutely gross.  The waiter was nonchalant, when he took the time to actually check on us.   When we advised the manager of everything that occurred, she apologized and stated that they don't hand wash the glasses.  I've been to a number of restaurants that have dishwashers and I've never had fresh lip prints on my glass.  The food was average.  The meat was tough and dry, everyone at my table had different cuts of meat and we all experienced the same issue.  The sides were good.  All in all, this location did not compare to the other Lucille's I have eaten at.",

    "text": "This was our 2nd visit at this location. Went about 10:30pm Saturday for late night bite.  Wife ordered Pulled Pork Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries & I ordered the Tri Tip Sandwich with Pasilla Peppers, Jack Cheese with Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw. Nothing special about the Pulled Pork Sandwich or Sweet Potato Fries.  Decent amount of Pork in Sandwich & good flavor but easily forgettable. Wouldn't crave it or make me want to come back to order same. Fries were barely warm & not crispy. More like having sit for some time? The Peanut Slaw was good but sure Stingy with amount served.  The Tri Tip Pasilla Pepper Sandwich had good flavor in general.  Meat was tender, juicy & tasty. The slivers of Pasilla Pepper with Jack Cheese added flavor to the meat.  However, again, stingy with the amount of meat & slivers of Pasilla Peppers.   They, like many Sandwich places, pile most of the meat in the center so when cut in half, appears to have adequate amount of meat? But the center pile was not very high & had to move some meat from center area to edges where no meat existed.   At first I though sandwich was going to have a whole Pasilla Pepper stuffed with Jack Cheese, which would have been great but as it turned out was only slivers of the pepper in very limited, sparsely spaced amount.  You'd think that, for $14.49 you would get a little more meat & an adequate amount of the peppers and use somewhat larger slices of bread?   The advertise thick grilled sourdough but I would prefer regular thinner larger slices! They use the thick sliced bread to make the sandwich appear bigger but in reality,  it's just a Small Fat $14.49 sandwich!  I'll have to try ordering the same sandwich at the District location to determine if that is same or not? My guess is that the District location will be better all around.  On the upside, the waiter service was great this time.",

When the food did arrive it was freezing cold. 3. The food didn't taste that good, i ordered the barbecue chicken sandwich with applewood smoked bacon which sounded appetizing on the menu yet when i received my sandwich the chicken was dry and the bacon had a similar texture to cardboard, it was far worse than microwavable bacon, and frankly i didn't even think it was bacon just some fake processed \"bacon flavored\" plastic. 4. The food didn't arrive all at once as it normally does at most restaurants, it came dish by dish, when one person finished there dish another one had arrived, and ironically (me being the only \"yelper\" of the group) my dish came last. I do understand they were swamped due to it being christmas day and all but this is flat out unacceptable. However they do have decent ribs. The only reason i gave this place 2 stars is because of our extremely nice server who was empathetic to the fact the kitchen had delayed our food and also because after speaking to the manager about our \"lovely christmas dinner\" he offered to comp our meal. If i ever do come here again ill make sure i will arrive 2 hours earlier then when i plan on eating.",

Eventually we ordered. I asked for side salad - what is on it? The usual plus cheese. Asked for no cheese. Showed up w croutons which were not mentioned. \"There's a process\" was answer to questions about ill timed meal. Manager dropped by. Oh the waiter was trainee you'll get the trainer now. You'll get service that exceeds your expectations. Uh no.  We split a rack of baby backs. They brought a tiny plate to split onto. Brought larger plate on request. Wanted second normal size plate. Had to catch a passing server. Paper napkins had to be requested. Hot towels brought far too late. The ribs,  corn and sweet potato fries were good. Service not!! Maybe if the server who was the trainer was well-trained the trainer would have been better? And the manager? Useless.",

    "text": "First, some positives.  Service was good, music playing (Stevie Ray, Keb Mo, etc) was great. Food was cooked well, hot, good presentation.  We've eaten here several times, but unfortunately, we've always been underwhelmed by the taste of the food.  Watermelon margarita with a float of ginger beer -- they didn't skimp on the alcohol, but it seemed they left out the watermelon.  The only thing we tasted was ginger beer.  Appetizer of BBQ Shrimp -- shrimp were good, and it would be great if you wanted shrimp in spaghetti sauce.  Not my idea of BBQ.  BBQ baked beans -- blah, no real flavor.  Sweet potato fries -- too much cajun seasoning, would have been better with just a sprinkle of regular salt.  Cole slaw was very good.  Brisket sandwich was pretty good -- hot, tender meat, but nothing special.  Lucille's BBQ sauces are not my favorite -- the original is too sweet.  We drive all the way across town to get here.  I doubt we'll be back.  It's not worth the drive.",

So 4 stars for these guys now and we will be back soon.",

One of my favorite parts of the trip was her saying, 'If you need me and I'm not available, you can get anyone, we're all a team here.'  This ensured we were taken care of the whole time!  She even brought out samplers of some of the sides we were interested in trying, free of charge!  We split a TON of appetizers and got entrees -- bad choice because the portions are HUGE, great choice because everything was so delicious!    I tried the corn chowder and smoked chicken pasta.  The corn chowder was delicious, creamy and a sweet corn flavor.  The smoked chicken pasta was incredible; the sauce was creamy and delicious, the pasta was well-cooked but not soggy and the chicken was tender and melt in your mouth.  I had the Georgia Peach (or something of that nature!) cocktail which was delicious; and moderately priced for the size.  Very refreshing and delicious.  I didn't get to try it but Lucille's also brews there own beer which I'm sure would have been great!  Overall, I recommend this place; it was a pleasant surprise in our hotel!",

    "text": "Definitely a chain and therefore variable. We have been to Lucille's other location in town a few times and its always hit or miss.  Here was no different.   the service was attentive and good.  She kept our drinks full and brought us two baskets of biscuits as we had multiple kids at the table.  The mistake they made was bringing the adults meals prior to the kids meals.  They should have come out first or at least all together.   The baby back ribs were good, fell off the bone so they were tender but they didn't pack much flavor.  The tri tip also was tender and lean this time and the sauce it came with was better than eating it with bbq sauce but again not a ton of flavor without the sauce.  The corn on the cob my friend got was juicy and good, the veggies another one got was seasoned well but my sweet potato (and i love sweet potatoes) was runny and bland.   We were all too full for dessert........we would come back due to the convenient location but for bbq itself we would go elsewhere. The issue we had too was that happy hour was only at the bar, so if we came with the kids after school we would be able to have food but not participate in happy hour. when we asked about it too we were told definitely not. So we would just go next door where we all could enjoy happy hour.",

    "text": "Ok i may be biased because i already know of Lucilles and have enjoyed their Ribs long ago in California.  Use to love to go for lunch and get the rib tips. BUT that was over 7 yrs ago. Since moving to Vegas Famous Daves are more around than Lucilles and driving to Henderson for happy hour isnt that appealing. SO such much excitement when i found out they were finally putting one at the Red Rock Casino location. SCORE you cant get no better than that. So  this was my 2nd time to this location and i will say since its new there are some kinks that need and will be worked out. Love the Happy Hour specials just need to make sure the staff knows exactly what really on special and whats not.. dont like surprises on the bill, but manager fixed it so no problem. The biscuit was so hard i really scratched my friend as i rubbed it on her hand jokingly. They quickly gave me some soft fresh biscuits as we laughed about it. As we sat at the bar area across from the smoker, i thought i was done ordering until they opened the smoker and all that deliciousness smell came drifting out along with slabs of mouth watering ribs.  Um waitress please add some rib tibs to my order please. OMG that the best thing ever. How could u pass it up after smelling it and seeing it pass by lol i couldnt. Yep its only been a few weeks. I got faith they will step it up and be even better. The atmosphere is great nice and comfortable. Will be going back and taking lots of friends.",

    "text": "First time trying this place, and left much to be desired.    Hostess staff attempting to use the southern drawl ..\"Ya'll\"... Just stop, this is Vegas, act like it and quit the stupidity.  The waiter also did another annoying throwback to Olive Garden and other large chain restaurants by squatting at our table to take our order.  I hate nothing more than trifle attempts at a larger tip thinking that such actions are welcomed.  Just take my order and take it well, do a good job is all I ask. Annoyance level - High.  I ordered the Hawaiian Mojito and my husband ordered the Dixie Sweet Tea.  These were the only reason that this review warranted the single star.    We ordered the fried Okra, which obviously is a pre-packaged item that is simply dropped in the fryer at the time of ordering and not made fresh.  We did not mind so much, because it was not entirely bad.    For our entrees my husband ordered the Po'Boy and I the Steak Sandwich.  His Po'Boy was overkilled by the bread, the catfish nuggets had no seasoning, the sauce on the sandwich had no flavor and the mac and cheese side was simply macaroni with cheese melted on top with no flavor.  My steak sandwich was completely overloaded with the peppers and onions and greens, the meat was extremely tough for supposedly being marinated the night before.  The Chiabata bread had to have been at least day old or older as it was hard as a rock and impossible to bite into.  I finally tried cutting the bread with the steak knife provided and the bread crumbled... The Baked Beans were edible.  The meat was inedible and my dog will be the only one to actually enjoy this meal. Of course, only after I take the meat and rinse and soak it before sharing with her.   I could not get out of there fast enough out of fear of being sick from what I actually consumed of the meal. It is really sad, because we did enjoy the atmosphere.  This was a waste of money and not anywhere worth the price point.  We will not return, nor recommend to anyone. Nice touch at leaving was that tootsie roll pops were given in substitution of mints at the door. Do not waste your time or money at this place and save your stomach.",

The food was ok, but the gravy they gave me for my steak looked like an oil slick and didn't taste much better. Thank goodness it was on the side. My sisters Mac & Cheese took forever to come out which I didn't understand at all. We actually had to ask our server about it.  Our servers name was Wendy, try to not get her when you go. She came to our table very rarely, never asked how the good was and didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything else, which we did. She just dropped the check.  Next time I'll just go to Yardhouse.",

    "text": "I swear, I don't know why people like this place so much. So this is the 4th time I been to a Lucille's. It's always someone else's idea, and never mine. It seems like I always get the overly dry baby back ribs. Grumbling all the way to Lucille's, I ordered the exact same thing as my girl. My incessant griping probably got to her nerves. I went with my rant on how my ribs always turn out dry and the only thing about this place is that they slather the ribs with a crapload of sauce. And then the waiter has the nerve to come and ask us how the ribs are after they give you a plate with enough sauce to drown both you and your dog, provided you went in with a seeing eye dog or something.  No, I don't know what's so great about the food. My ribs came out dry. But I told the waiter and the manager this time. Every time I go to one, I always get the dry one. I gave 3 pieces to my girl and she nodded her head that it was dry compared to hers. So the grumbler wasn't grumbling for the heck of it. But they were nice enough and got me new ones which were not as dry. But it gets pretty old to almost always having to do it when you order your food. You know for a nice BBQ without the wait or pretense, I'd go to Dickey's.  What I do like about Lucille's. Their staff are generally friendly and good. I just don't care for their food that much. The sides are good. My ribs sucked but my mac and cheese was great. As are the freebie rolls. Kind of sad that I like the sides more than the main dish. But if you are going to advertise yourself as smokehouse, inhouse made bbq sauce, etc., I'd expect a modicum of tastiness to the meat.  All in all, my 4th time and I still hate going. Until the next time when I get dragged to this place again for a get together, birthday, or whatever event; I'll get ready to eat more biscuits.  -------------------- Update ------------------- I received a response from the owner the next day regarding my experience. I must say, I did not expect a response especially since both locations are always busy whenever I go. I am not in a hurry to go back since I am pretty unlucky ordering but my friends like it enough to recommend we meet up here if that's any indication of their food. I give 5 stars to the owner for caring about his customers. If you are as popular and successful as Lucille's and still read a humble reviewer without a 1,000 reviews behind him, then you are A ok in my book.",

Just make sure you have good company to make the time go fast. Appreciate the text message updates of place in line. Now, waiting with Tokyo Teas (Think Long Island without the Coke, add Midori) in hand made the wait even more bearable. Appreciate the speed in which the bartender knocked out 2 Tokyo Teas, 1 Rum Punch, and an old fashioned. We had an accident with one of the Tokyo Teas when being seated, and management replaced it...with no issue and without having to ask them. The food was phenomenal, HOT, and well worth the wait to be seated. You won't get your food instantly, but good things come to those who wait. Recommend tag teaming dishes, because they are large...this will save you some money, but won't cheat you on the quantity of savory goodness.",

There are only 2  place I have found in Vegas that always has beef ribs and this is one of them.    Here is the thing, the ribs are smoked well and very tasty but you could put that sweet sauce on tree bark and I would go for it. These ribs are the definition of beef back shiners. 3 for $24 seems like a jack move to me, but I always pay it for these tasty treats. There are better cuts for cheaper in Las Vegas but the sweet sauce on these pull me in everytime.   If the price was reduced to match the amount of actual meat you can get off a rib bone or if you could get one rib on a combo plate then I would raise how many stars i gave. Catch 22.",

The waitress was beyond awesome and the manager went to every table asking how people were doing. My mom was so impressed that she doesn't want to go any where else for ribs.  I haven't been happy with Famous Daves, as their ribs are super fatty and it's really hit or miss when it comes to quality. Yes Famous Daves may be a little less expensive than Lucille's, but the quality is night and day. Makes more sense to get the full rack for leftovers.  I've had their brisket, also delish. Love the sides.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review.  I hope Lucille's doesn't change the quality of meat they have because it's so perfect.  I will be returning to Lucille's soon",

Did not ask us if we wanted to be seated in the bar. We got our drinks and ordered our food. Then the manager guy comes and says he has to move us because the wheelchair is a fire code hazard where we are seated. Why did you seat us there in the first place? We move to a table but still in the bar. Our food comes and so does the loud band. We can't hear each other. My friend's pork ribs come and I notice about 10 minutes later that the pork is red, not pink, red. Her mashed potatoes taste like a clump of garlic and her corn is hard. My husband's brisket is dry and tough. My hamburger is okay. No discount for making us move, nothing. Could the Temecula manager come train the Red Rock Lucille's manager?? He needs help.",

Both servers should go to the table and introduce the other.   So then we were upset with John because we still didn't get attention. I thought maybe things would get better but they never did. We love Lucilles bbq and unfortunately it'll be a while until we come back. Ribs and Mac n cheese were delicious though.

We got there before the dinner rush so we were able to get a table right away even though it was a Friday night.  Our waiter came by and took our drink orders quickly.  He then brought the drinks and took our food order.  It took a bit of time to get a basket of biscuits but I think they had to cook another batch.    For our entrees, I did the two meat combo with pulled pork and burnt ends.  My sides were the peanut coleslaw and mixed veggies.  The veggies normally come with peppers in them but I was able to exclude those.  Good sign that they don't pre-make the veggies.  Everything was delicious.  I loved both meats and the coleslaw had a good vinegar bite.  It was a large portion so I was able to take half of it home for lunch the next day.    Mom had a half rack of ribs with corn on the cob and beans.  She really liked everything especially the fresh corn.  Definitely no frozen corn on the cob here.  So definitely a great place to get your BBQ fix.  The service can be hit or miss but we had good service this time around and the food was yummy!",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2016, #6 of 100  When dining at the Red Rock resort it is nice to have so many options that are family friendly. It was our first time dining at this establishment but have had plenty of positive experiences at many other Lucille's restaurants in SoCal. This was not as good when compared to the others.   I wanted to give a 1 star for the overall experience but went with a 2 star because, Roberto our server was very kind and checked on us a few times but the negative experience has more to do with the wait time. Initially I walked down from my room to scope it out because if you have been to a Lucille's on a Saturday evening you may experience a long wait to be seated. I walked to the reception desk and the place was about half full. The receptionist said they had plenty of seats available. What? I said to myself, that's great for us. Had the family come join me and we were seated immediately. That's when we notice something was wrong. They sat us next to a party of about 25 people in a small table next to the waiter's computer/serving station. Okay, family of 4, small table in an uncomfortable location with plenty of open booths around. Then I thought they saved those for bigger parties but no. They were sitting couples in the oversized booths. I should have spoken up but we were hungry and wanted food.   Ordered drinks right away, took a few minutes for them to arrive. I like ordering the tall Guinness, it's a good deal plus better on calories, slightly. Then the wait started. It took another good 10 minutes before the rolls showed up, I usually stay away from the rolls but my family likes them.   It was another 10 minutes before we placed our order. Simple, Lucille's grilled chicken salad for me, wife had the half chicken, kids both wanted the penne pasta from kids menu. I figured wouldn't take that long because majority of their meats are smoked and it should be prepared. Wrong! It took another 25 minutes before our food arrived. What upset me even more was they brought out 3 meals first and took another 5 minutes to bring my son his kids meal. Server said they had to make more pasta. All I am saying here is have some common sense or decency. Bring the kids their food first. My son is 7 but he was a little bothered by it. I understand this is a small life lesson that I could give him but this wasn't the venue for it. Roberto apologized and said they were busy because people were having holiday parties and they had 2 big groups at same time. Okay, that's not my problem but you are making it my problem because of the long wait time. Parties are usually planned out and the party more than likely gave an advanced notice to the restaurant and the management team either thought they could handle it, did not schedule proper staff, or staff members called in sick and left the burden on their peers.   My family finished their food and left. I remained seated to finish my second beer and to pay. The food was good. It was what one would expect at any Lucille's. The negative was the absurd wait time. There are plenty of restaurants in the resort and a few within walking distance in downtown Summerlin to choose from. Maybe lady luck will be on your side but this particular night I crapped out with the pick. Probably won't dine here again. Good luck and happy eating!",

We order the fried green tomatoes the brisket nachos and the bayou shrimp which all loved except the tomatoes. Once we got our food we asked for water for about 15 minutes and it took the buster to do it he kept ignoring us and was drunk the brisket chx and Baby backs were really good also. I would try this place again but I won't sit at the bar next time... PS I am a waitress so I always tip no matter what but I just couldn't do it this time he had 2 tables and didn't take care of us the way he should've. In parking lot writing this review",

I love the jazz music that is often playing and looking at the Southern pictures throughout the restaurant. There are jazz paintings as well. Think New Orleans. There are even Mardi Gras beads used in the decor. Part of the restaurant is called the back porch. The food is Southern style. Lots of really good food! You won't leave hungry!

I was sorely disappointed. I ordered the brisket, greens and mashed potatoes. The only thing I had that was remotely edible were the potatoes. The brisket was cut into small pieces and hard as wood chips. Everyone knows brisket is supposed to be thick cut and sliced not cut into small squares. Its supposed to be juicy and easy to eat. The greens were so spicy I couldn't eat them. Idk what they put in them. But... I will not be going back here. If you're looking for GOOD BBQ don't eat here.",

For our sides we got the delicious and creamy garlic mash potatoes and baked beans. At the end you get a dessert to share and we chose the chocolate cake. Not dry and quite moist.

The mac and cheese was watered down and worse than Kraft. My wife ordered brisket, mashed potatoes, and greens. The brisket was dry and the greens were way too spicy. Not only was our food almost inedible, the prices are ridiculous. We spent $45 for the both of us. We could've spent $15 at Chick-fil-A and been satisfied.  Sorry but we are never returning.",

Presentation was awful; looked like something someone whipped up at home. The filling was not developed enough in taste, all that stood out was mustard flavor--could've used more herbs. The consistency was also thinner than I would like. The wedge salad had outside layers that were already soft, alongwith presentation lacking as well since the topping had peeled away at the wedge. As for entrees, the baby back ribs were SMALL. I had 3 bones the size of my pinky. If I did not get the 2-meat combo that also consisted of the St. Louis Ribs, I would definitely have asked for a manager. How do you expect those 3 bones to be a complete meal if someone were to get those by itself? I've had a better rack from Whole Foods. The glaze was beautiful on the ribs though, flavorful without extra bbq needed. Biscuits were very soft and moist! The potato salad was not my type, it had a pronounced mustard taste. I don't think I would come back to this location, maybe the Henderson one.",

I came with hubby and friend to try this Lucille's at 11am. The place is huge in size and includes a music stage for music band. The menu looks different for Lucille's in California. The menu prices seem higher in price. I ordered a tri tip sandwich with bake potato and peach ice tea. Our waitress was very good on refills and kept checking on us. The tri tip sandwich was delicious and not dry in a bun. The bake potato was delicious with everything on it. The waitress said the bake potato is back to serve during lunch. Yay good news.

Service was friendly and efficient with our server Ashlee checking on us throughout. The baby back ribs have vastly improved The ribs were much larger and meatier. They were cooked perfectly to fall of the bone tender. The pulled pork was tender and with a nice Memphis style sauce. For my taste no additional sauce was required for the ribs or pulled pork. The sides of cole slaw and baked beans were the perfect complement to the BBQ    The portions of meat were large enough to provide a second meal.",

However, I must say that my disappointment with this visit has nothing to do with the spilt drink, accidents happen and that's totally understandable, really. What was disappointing was managements lack of trying to make up for it. Sure, they apologized more that we could count. But I feel like if a manager had to pull out her phone to use the flashlight to check for glass on my ONE MONTH old baby, that our meal should have have been comped. Or, a free dessert, AT MINIMUM. Receiving a full priced meal after an accident that could have ended much worse was shocking, to say the least. We would have at least liked to have had the opportunity to turn down a discounted meal. Regardless, accidents happen and we tipped our waitress the same as if the service was perfect.   Our meal was mediocre - as expected - and the managers lack of compensation was unfortunate.",

They had reserved seats for us and since only half our party was there they gave the seats away. That's understandable. When the rest of our party came around 6, they stated we had to wait for the party to leave and should be soon. There was an entire back section open and available in which they said was reserved for others who previously called and made a reservation. So one hour passed and at 7pm we were quite upset and asked to speak to a manager. We went back and forth to say the least. One employee (ashley) said with a snarky attitude \"if you don't like it, go to yard house!\" (Next door) then she proceeded to storm out running into my nieces (ages 6-11) on her way to the front door. So after more than 1.5 hours of waiting and our children being physically harmed we left and ate at the food court inside the hotel.   Terrible customer we service!!!!!!!",

Not once has it even been OK service actually- Ask for extra sauces when you order and you will not get them, ask when they don't bring them and they still never come out. Ask for a different side than a meal comes with and you likely won't get it, but the wait time for food is not worth asking them to fix it. Food takes a VERY long time to come out- a stupid amount of time- regardless of time of day, how busy(or not busy) it is, or the amount of staff working. You might see your waiter/waitress once for refills and once to check in for the 1.5 hours you're basically forced spend here for a party of 5.   MAKE A RESERVATION FOR LARGE PARTIES OR ON WEEKENDS!!!! It will be a super long wait otherwise. Probably close to 45 minutes without a reservation on a weekend night for a family size (4-6 ppl) party.  The food is UH-MAZING. I've never had a menu item or drink I didn't like. The ONLY reason we come back time and time again!!! We do take out more often then dine in- I suggest that route over done-in ANY day.",

Actually we have walked out due to waiting 15 minutes for our waiter to come and wait on us. Our waitress definitely redeemed our last few experiences. She took our full order but our food arrived perfectly. The biscuits arrived nice and hot. The cinnamon butter melted in seconds. Just as we were trying to lick the plate clean from the yummy brisket nachos, our big beautiful beef ribs came out. We ordered 2 baked potatoes and a side salad. They even brought an extra side of ranch. We didn't ask for it but a definite bonus. The beef ribs had the perfect amount of smoke. We think the ribs beat out some of our favorite spots in Texas. When a Texas family doesn't need to add on any bbq sauce, you know the meat is good! Well done Lucille's! The hot towel is a great ending to our meal & the waitress hooked me up with the best glass of to go peach tea. Perfect Sunday! I look forward to changing my review to 5 stars if they can be consistent with the service & I'd be really, really happy if they would bring the homemade potato chips back. Those were the best things ever!",

    "text": "The only positive thing I have to say is that our server was awesome! However, I was very disappointed to say the least. The chicken was just ok. No complaints tho. The burnt ends were very dry and only got about 7 small pieces. The spicy sausage was good but immediately after eating it I got sick to my stomach and had to rush home. The sides were by far the worse I've ever eaten. I got the Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. The Mac and cheese was very dry and had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were very bland as well. My son, who loves ribs, was also disappointed and kept saying how we should have went to famous Dave's instead. A friend recommended this place and I figured I try some place new for my birthday with my family. Needless to say, it was the worse $150 we've ever spent. I hate to write such a negative review but my advice is to save your money and go to famous Dave's or even chili's whi has better bbq.",

For starters, ordered our drinks; the mojito was sweet and minty. So refreshing!  We had the complimentary biscuits and apple butter.  We were in a low carb diet but hubby and I devoured these warm delicious biscuits ( with the promise we have to work out the next day) but it was so worth the calories. Go slow on the appetizers as they come in large servings-- we had the crunchy onion straws and the tortilla chips with spinach & cheese dip. We were almost getting full when our entrees arrived.  The barbecues we ordered were whole slab of baby back ribs (really moist and tender) tri tips and beef brisket. Finger licking good! We didn't even have to use the sauces on the table as the barbecues were very flavorful already. The sides were Mac & Cheese, greens, corn on a cob, baked beans, slaw & watermelon; all the sides go very well with the BBQs.  Our server was very attentive and nice.   Overall, happy with this and all previous visits. The place to go to when we're craving for slow cooked BBQs!",

I have been here twice and my orders have been messed up both times and things like the biscuits were under cooked and the ribs were overcooked. However the staff was nice just disorganized took a incredibly long time to get a refill etc. Very nice restaurant with nice windows facing a fountain however the food quality control needs some major help. Extra star for cleanliness and location however this Lucille's is not consistent with the other locations.",

The atmosphere is acceptable, some cool artistic things around the restaurant but I didn't spend a lot of time looking at it.  They bring sodas out in huge mason jars - which is perfect because I drink them very quickly. I ordered their signature soup, a corn chowder. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Seriously - best corn chowder ever. EVER. Perfect balance of sweet and salty, lots of veggies too. Server brought out some biscuits as well, and they were just okay, maybe a little dry but the sweet sugar butter they serve with it is yummy.  For my entree I had the half chicken - served with 2 sides; I chose mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, all of it was very good and the chicken was not dry at all, the skin was slightly crispy from the grill and had a very good BBQ sauce on it. All that for only $25  Dessert looked good but I was far too full.  Server was super nice, very attentive.",

I ordered the half rack with two sides.  I feel the price is a little high but that's to be expected with a chain Bar-B-Que establishment.  The whole table loved the shredded onion appetizer.  We went on a Friday night around 7, party of three, and had no problem being seated.  I would like to go back and try their Happy Hour in the bar so maybe next visit.",

Obviously the Green Valley location has been around a longer and has service down pat. This Red Rock location is still working on things, but they're not doing too bad.  The portion sizes are huge, so you can easily share a two meat dish with someone. You both will need to be extremely hungry to finish it. My favorite dishes are the southern fried chicken and the brisket. My favorite sides include mashed potatoes and cole slaw. And you can't go wrong with fried pickles as an appetizer. Want a cocktail?

I'm a vegetarian and I understand that this is a BBQ place so I asked the host if there were any vegetarian options. She told me the two items so we asked to be seated. She was very nice. Our waitress came and took our order. I got the portobello sandwich and explained that I am vegetarian. Got the French fries too. She brought the biscuits after. Lots of places use animal fat so I wanted to make sure these didn't have any. I asked the woman waiting the table behind us because ours was no where in sight. She said she didn't know and would go ask for me. After she walked past the table a few times we assumed she wasn't going to answer. Then the manager brought our food to our table. So I asked him, he went and checked and came back in one minute. He was very nice. We were talking about how the chips in lots of places fry then in the oil they cook the chicken in. While eating the fries. We decided to ask and our waitress said oh yeah I didn't even think of that when you ordered. So I just stopped eating. Needless to say I would not recommend this place to anyone who may not want to eat a particular food. They don't care about your allergy or preference. If you will eat anything, I'd say stop by, I hear the food is pretty good.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE experience.     Long story that isn't worth the time to get into b/c I wouldn't go back to this place.   Please DO NOT mistake this for the Lucille's in Henderson which I actually love.  But this place is run by a bunch of idiots and the stupidity trickles down through all of the employees that we dealt with.    Showed up and told the hostess that we were there for happy hour (for the food).  We had 2 young kids with us so sat us in a booth just outside the bar area but technically in the main dining area.  Settled in... got daughter #1 in a booster seat and daughter #2 stayed in her car seat so had to adjust the booth a bit to get her to fit in... but took a few minutes to get settled.    Waiter comes and takes our drink order.   We ask about the happy hour menu for some appetizers and he says that happy hour is only in the bar area.  We explained to the waiter that we told the hostess that we were there for happy hour.  So we asked if kids were allowed in the bar area.  He said that they were.    So we looked around and there were maybe 4 or 5 other tables occupied in the entire place as it was an off time of the day... maybe 3 pm or so.  So we simply asked if it was really a big deal for them to make us move our kids, drinks, menus and all of that stuff.   He said that happy hour needed to be rung up in the bar.  So we just asked if he could just ring our order in at the bar.  He said that he wasn't allowed b/c of his manager.  We asked if we could speak with the manager.  He tracked down his manager within earshot of our table and we heard the manager basically tell him that wasn't an option and he wasn't going to come all the way over to our table to tell us that....  of course he had a bit of an attitude that he was being asked such a crazy request.  So the waiter came back to tell us what he said and we stopped him and said that we want to talk to the manager... so we insisted that he actually make him come over to talk with us.  We repeated our request to the manager and explained that we weren't trying to be difficult but seems like a fairly simple problem with a fairly simple solution.  So he gave us the line that if he makes an exception for us... then he needs to make an exception for everybody...  so again... we look around the restaurant to see the 4 or 5 other tables that were occupied which were all in the bar except for 1 couple finishing up a couple tables away from us.  I explained that there wasn't anyone else in the bar to worry about and thought it was silly that a \"manager\" cannot make a basic customer service decision like this.  He insisted that it was not possible....  So my wife and I debated whether we wanted to move to a new table or just leave.  Again... with 2 kids and a hot day... just decided to move to another table since we were starving.     So we get a new waitress b/c it is her section and she chooses to make sarcastic remarks from the very beginning about us having issues.   Took our order and gave us the bare minimum in terms of service.   We had to flag down random people for drink refills and the food came out all at once (appetizers and main course)   Food wasn't prepared well... but what's the point of complaining at this point.  So we laughed it off... got sarcastic with the waitress towards the end... left her a big fat Zero for a tip and won't be back.    It is crazy what a night and day difference the Red Rock location is versus the Henderson location.   And for what it's worth....  it seems that we get poor service at just about every restaurant at the Red Rock Casino which is disappointing b/c it is such a nice place.   But seriously.... 10 years I have been in town and probably 5 or 6 restaurants there have consistently bad service.  This has been the worst by far!",

NO communication about when we were to be seated.  Not only our party but many other guests were saying the same thing.  This has happened to us twice at this Lucilles - and as a result this will be our last visit.",

    "text": "Lucilles is listening! We skipped last years thanksgiving meal and made our own because 2016 dinner was not good from here. (See review) This year we decided to cater from them again for thanksgiving dinner and OMG the food was absolutely perfect. Creamy mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes, they added a vegetable side of green beans (I hate green bean casserole and this was way better!) tons of turkey and ham smoked to perfection, regular fluffy biscuits, sweet potato pie, stuffing that was not spicy at all, gravy, and cranberry sauce. Very very good! Hats off to the chefs who prepared it this year because it was prepared perfectly. Our guests really enjoyed the food and I enjoyed not having to cook. Worth every penny. ($200 for the entire feast.) I will cater from them again next year for turkey day. $400 for two whole turkey dinners to feed a party of 20 with plenty of leftovers for the UofM & OSU game the following day! Soooo worth it.",

    "text": "Quiet and with a sense of southern backyard charm, I was pleasantly surprised the people-thirtsy Lucille's had such tasty food. Although on the expensive side, I thought of this BBQ joint similar to Olive Garden with its Italian food: affordable and fancy, but not gourmet.  You are offered their complimentary biscuits and cinnamon butter. I was not a fan of said butter. It made the already sweet biscuits sweeter. If you have children with an appetite, please, allow them to indulge at least. My waitress was gracious and efficient, quickly offering me my drink options ($3 for the largest Mason jar you've ever seen! Reminded me of Memphis, TN BBQ). No complaints there. It was after I ordered my food that it seemed to take ages for it to arrive. I felt the staff may have lost my request and kept anxiously glancing over towards the kitchen.  When you start running out of conversational topics, biscuit to stuff your face with AND you pull out your phone to start watching the latest episode of a series you're into, you know the wait was bad.  Lucille's smokes their meat in-house in a smoker right smack in the middle of the floor. My waitress was kind enough to inform me that I would taste the gaseous fumes, which I expected. Overall, the food was delicious and filling. Not only was everything fresh and well thought out, warm towels were brought out to satisfactorily clean my hands. Definitely beats the moist towelettes you get at other establishments.  Stop on in for a touch of Southern charm. Yee-haw!",

I don't know if they changed the recipe or what has happened, but the past 3-4 times i've ordered delivery from Lucille's, the biscuits have been terrible (i usually get an order of 6). They have been stale, hard, and dry every time. I can't even cut the biscuit in half without it crumbling into my hands. I am a die hard fan of these biscuits, and they have just been such a disappointment the last few times i've ordered them. I highly doubt these are being served to the customers who are dining in.. please, Lucille's, stop giving your old, dry, hard biscuits to those ordering delivery from you!!",

    "text": "TL:DR crowd - served MOLDY grilled cheese, sub par service and still paid for 70% even though everyone lost their appetites and didn't eat half their food.  We've been to the GVR location of Lucille's before and had a lovely time with great food and fantastic service.   No brainer when we wanted a great place to go for a birthday!  The Red Rock Casino Lucille's was much closer to where we are staying this time, so we chose that location.   We called about 2 hours in advance for an 8:30 seating for 8 people. We were seated around 8:45. We watched them clean the tables and then stay empty 5 minutes so we begged them to seat us as the 3 younger kids were taking up space in the super small indoor entrance and causing some traffic flow issues.   The waiter took our order about 10 minutes later. Drinks arrived and our shoestring onions (tasty!!) arrived 15 minutes after that.   Our food trailed in 20 minutes later in shifts. We got 3 plates (and a salad that was an appetizer added to a meal) and then a few minutes later, 4 more trickled in. The birthday girl was last to receive her food a good 5 minutes after the rest of us.   She had only taken a few bites when we realized one of the kids was chowing down on a MOLDY grilled cheese sandwich.   We asked the bartender for a manager. She took 10 minutes to arrive. She listened to us then said she wanted to take the bread back to have the kitchen manager check it. Five or so minutes later, she came back stating she gave us a sizable discount and took the kid's grilled cheese off.   The birthday girl ate two bites and the rest of us had half the food on their plates and didn't want to eat another bite. 30% off. Our bill went from around $160 to $99 and we have 8 people half full and one very angry kid who got a sandwich taken away from him. (The manager did not show us a receipt or tell us an amount. She had the waiter deliver it a few minutes later and we never saw her again.)  Subpar service and terrible quality control. Don't know if we will return because that thought will always be lingering.   What a sad birthday dinner!",

(Insert the song  - T'Aint Nobody's Business If I Do by Otis Spann (1930 - 1970))  We walked through the Red Rock Casino and Resort to the casino entrance. We noticed a sign asking patrons to go to the other hostess station to be seated. While walking to the OTHER SIDE of the restaurant we were greeted by someone \"who would be happy to seat us.\" Only to have that person turn around and seat us at the nearest booth... how convienent.  (Insert the song  - Born Under A Bad Sign by Albert King (1923 -1992))  The atmosphere was fine, loved the decorations, love the music being played. Part of the decor included fake trees in one section of the dining room. Which led me to wonder how much dust has collected on the leaves. How often are the leaves actually cleaned?  (Insert the song  - Dust My Broom by Elmore James (1918 - 1963))  The food was fine by me. I had some chicken and brisket which is a staple in my diet. But no sooner would I server come by and ask how things are doing, a manager or such would ask the same two minutes later. Felt kinda over done.   (Insert the song  - Got To Be Some Changes Made by Otis Rush (b. 1934))  All in all everything was real good. But it was the little things that added up and made me want to leave one star off my review. Would I return to Lucille's? Let me answer that by saying...  (Insert the song -  One more now, Lucille Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more? Look out, Lucille Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright -  B.B. King (1925 - 2015))",

My biggest complaint is that the rest aran smells smokey since it's inside the red rock casino. I wonder if there would be less smoke if the restaurant was fully closed instead of being somewhat open to the casino, oh and there are no bathrooms here, you must got out into the casino and find a bathroom, wish there was a sign cause I went on a long journey to find one when there was one to my left walking out that I didn't see until going back. Anywho....  GET THE SWEET TEA. I love me some diabetes tea. The there biscuits are so good with the apple butter. Mmmmm. I could eat a dozen of those. Bbq is good, now I haven't had real Texas bbq, but I'd imagine this is close. I love the spicier bbq sauce that they have on the table. Usually get the tri tip sandwich with Mac and cheese, the apps are delish, and pretty much everything I have had is bomb. The one thing I hate is how busy this place is and there always seems to be a wait to get in. There is a live band so parts of the restaurant gets really loud, but that's part of the feel. Don't forget your tootsie pop on the way out!",

When i inquired about the open tables the section i was inquiring about was closed.  That was interesting to say the least as there were two tables in that same section were people were seated eating. Again this the same thing we were told the last time we tried to eat there and there were open/empty tables.  We left and took our business to another resturant. Needless to say we wont try again to eat there.",

    "text": "We came here on a company lunch celebrating our boss' birthday.  The atmosphere of this place gave me instant nostalgia from all the BBQ joints in Nashville.  I got the burnt ends Lunch Special with a side of Mac & Cheese. The burnt ends portion was small as expected, but with how flavorful it was, I felt full and satisfied at the end. The mac and cheese wasn't overly greasy which was a surprise. Great balance of flavors where nothing in it was overwhelming the other. Service was excellent as well. Not too overbearing not too unattentive, just right.  However, I had 2 issues with the biscuits. My first impression of a lot of Southern food joints starts with the biscuits. The biscuits are a reflection of how the food will taste. On these biscuits, they put a LOT of sugar on the bottom and on the top of it. It was too sweet for me, so I had to scrape as much sugar off as I could. When I was scraping off the bottom of a second biscuit, I noticed that there was a small metal thing that probably came from where the biscuits are packaged.  They were nice about it though and took my meal off the check.  Overall, the BBQ is great, the biscuits are sweet, and the small thing in the biscuit was a little worrying.",

There are lots of TV's for your viewing pleasure, if you're into sports. The side facing the front of the casino, near the parking lot, has the hostess station. The side open to the casino is technically the back. We've sat on both ends of the restaurant. The side fronting the parking lot, has a more entertainment feel because there is a small stage. The part in the middle of those two sections is near the gigantic smoker. The side towards the casino has a dining room feel. (If you need to go to the bathroom, it's just outside of the restaurant, in the casino.) Music is playing, in the background, but the noise level isn't too bad, either.   Love the biscuits and the butter. Our son loves it too. (When you have a picky child and he finds some favorites, we're happy.) We enjoy two dishes here very much, which is why we've gotten the same thing the last two visits (twice in January), brisket nachos and gumbo. Our son loves the gumbo. Full of flavor. Nice generous portions, big enough to share, for now, our son's six years old. It was funny, our son just noticed that the water comes in jugs (supposed to be like canning jars).  The staff and service is great. And the manager always stops by to check on every table too. Clean restaurant.",

    "text": "***UPDATE:  Went last night. Suddenly the prices went way up! Not a good idea when locals are iso a nice bbq place. Now you're spending $65+ for two ppl. One appetizer a side & a plate w/2 waters?! Then as I sat down at my table I hear a server I saw her name tag but won't post her name (\"A\") tells a manager \"I wish you could just send them all away-Tell everyone to just go home!\"...Wow so you want all of your customers to go home? Don't you want money?! I assume you're not rich & working for tips just for \"fun\" -very disappointing to hear waitstaff wanting us all to go home. Immediately put a huge damper on our meal. We also had no salt & pepper or the 3 bbq sauces on our table so my guest had to get up & get them all himself. 2 waitresses sat there & watched him do it. I really do not appreciate customers having to do work while lazy servers hang out & talk about who's getting cut when & what sides did you do. Ugh!  I didn't have an enjoyable meal after the prices went to $30 for a two meats plate & her rude unprofessional comment. I guess we will go find another bbq place to go to as a Summerlin resident instead.   The flavors were all smoked and they had a variety of meat cuts- beef ribs, brisket, chicken, sausage etc. we got the deal for two ppl ($49) 3-4 meats w two sides and cheesecake for dessert. I'm stuffed. In a good way lol. 3 diff bbq sauces. Carolina style vinegar yellow mustard based. Regular and sweet/spicy. Mac n cheese was decent potato salad was decent I'm picky bc I make my own homemade white truffle Mac n cheese lol. Overall good size space, plenty of TVs & friendly waitstaff. I'll be back when I'm craving some bbq. The only thing I can't stand is the red Bucket of mystery dirty water that the heat used to clean off my table. Please use one time only cleaning supplies. Sooo many germs on those rags. Blah. Otherwise no other complaints :)",

This may not necessarily be your local southern authentic BBQ joint (yes, it's a chain), but it's still a very good choice when you're in the mood for some meats.   It's in the Red Rock casino complex where you'll find ample and free parking.   They have a couple of large dining rooms with tables and booths. The night we visited they were having live music and asked if we wanted to be near or far from the music (we picked far). Reservations are accepted here, by the way.   Our server was.. ok. He seemed friendly enough but would disappear for seemingly extended periods of time during which time we could not get drink refills, etc.   They had a special which included a half size starter (or a soup or salad), a platter of several meats, and a dessert for $49.99. We went for this and got the chicken tenders starter. These were nothing too amazing though their breading was unique and better than your usual fast food tenders. The meat platter had a great variety of assorted meats all of which were extremely tender and flavorful. The ribs (baby back and St Louis) were amazingly delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender. We opted for fries and corn on the cob for the two sides. The fries were fairly standard. The corn was juicy and delicious. Dessert was their seasonal beignets with a peach caramel sauce. Not bad but not amazing and not too many peaches in the sauce.  Of note, definitely make room for some of their amazing biscuits and apple butter. These things are seriously addictive and, having been to Lucille's before, definitely played a roll in this return visit!",

They had exactly what I wanted and also had garlic mayo !!! When I got the burger I was taken aback by the sheer size. The presentation was a 10/10.  It only took the first bite to know this was the best burger I've ever had. They have 3 different kinds of bbq sauce on each table and all 3 are the tops. The French fries were straw fries (thin) which I found a plus. I was able to save half of the burger for a later meal, anyone who can eat this thing in one go, your colon is going to be working overtime. When you order the check they bring out hot wet towels for your hands. This is a very nice touch that not a lot of places do. The manager was kind to me as well. Will be back!!",

I got the full rack of baby back ribs both times and the first time it was incredible the meat fell of the bone and it was so tender. Today, it was just okay. It was dry and a little tough. I really do like the options of two little sides that comes with the dish. It's a nice little thing especially when you're paying $30 for the rack. My girlfriend got the smoked chicken pasta and it was good but a little on the bland side. I wouldn't get it again. Overall, our experience this time wasn't the greatest, the service was mediocre but the warm towel after the meal is an excellent touch. You have bbq sauce all over your fingers and face and this nice warm wet towel awaits you like at the barbershop. I like that but overall our experience was just okay.",

The staff here is always nice and friendly. They will help with any questions that you have.   This location at Red Rock has an outside entrance. So you do t have to venture through the casino if you don't want to. I find this very convenient and actually wish more casino restaurants did this.",

    "text": "My cousins enjoy eating American BBQ and wanted to check out Lucille's after hearing a lot of positive buzz about it. Unfortunately there are only two locations in the Vegas area, and this location is located in Red Rock casino - a casino that's more for the locals than the tourists (the other is in Henderson). With all the competition in American BBQ out there, I think Lucille's can hold its own.   We came on an early Thursday night, but we still had to wait for several minutes before a table could be set up for us. We wanted to order some items off of the happy hour menu, and they stated that in order to do so, we couldn't remain sitting in the area that we had been seated in. Not sure why, but we all moved over to another area of the dining room. Comfy seating, nice interior - busy atmosphere that matches the inside of the casino.   Workers are all pretty friendly and quick to come by with water, beverages, etc. Like all other Lucille's, the menu is extensive with a lot of very big portions. I don't think you'll leave here feeling hungry. You start off with the warm biscuits and apple butter - one of my favorites! Love the sweetness of the apple butter when eaten with the warm and crumbly biscuit. Unfortunately you can't eat too many or you'll become full before you eat your main course!  Memphis pork loaded fries: $5 off the happy hour menu. These are tasty if you like pork, cheese and bacon bits on top of shoestring fries. I wasn't a big fan - very salty and too much going on. You can feel your cholesterol go up after eating this.   BBQ rib tips: These were on the happy hour menu - about 8 tips that have been marinated in BBQ sauce. These were tasty and easy to eat. Loved the flavor, but of course added extra sauce to make them saucier.   BBQ 2 meat combo: A dish that you should share if you don't want to be stuffed! We ended up ordering the tri tip and beef rib along with mashed potatoes and beans. The meat was super heavy and didn't have enough sauce; however, taste was on point and the overall dish was incredibly filling. They had given us the wrong side order and ended up just grabbing the correct one and giving it to us along with the others. Nothing too special about the other side orders. I enjoyed the beef ribs the most. Not the tastiest I've had, but the flavor was on point and there was a smoky taste which I enjoyed.  tl;dr - Solid American BBQ joint (and of course, I love the Tootsie Pops that they offer here!) with good food at a decent price. Quantity is SUPER large, which has its pros and cons. Service is pretty great and no need to scout for parking.",

It IS delicious and cooked properly, but VERY expensive.  Garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful. Perhaps the BEST cole slaw I've ever had. The baby back ribs were falling off the bone. Pulled pork was good, especially with added sauce. The BBQ Tri tip was a bit dry and tough.  Went during Happy Hour (4pm - 7pm) but that only works if you're \"in the lounge\" which means at the bar. Had to get up from our table to go to the bar to order the lower priced drinks ($6 for a Long Island - which doesn't come with Tequila.. Very strange).  For a rare special occasion, I can see going here, but not a regular place to go. Actually, I don't know of a barbecue place that IS this good, so maybe there is no other place to go if you love barbeque?",

Flavorful, and well-prepared, the food was good.  The service, however, was horrible.  Yes, it was a Friday night, and it was crowded, but that's no excuse.  Inside of a Las Vegas Casino, the service should never be bad.  If the kitchen can keep up, the service staff should be able to also.  If the service had been better, I would have given it 5 stars.  It's a chain BBQ restaurant after all, and the food could have been only marginal, but again, it was good.  I would go back again.  Maybe they were just having an off night.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Lucille's BBQ at Red Rock Casino based on other Yelp reviews.   Things started out quite well.  I was lucky enough to score a table quickly (less than 5 minute wait) on a Saturday night.  The server came by promptly to provide menus and get our drinks orders.  She came back quickly with our drinks and was ready to take our food orders. We hadn't had much time to look through the menus but we had some meals in mind so gave her our orders.  Turns out this would be the theme of the night - service was too fast. Not something you usually want to complain about but we felt that we were rushed out.  I had ordered  a salad to come before the meal. They brought the complimentary biscuits and the salad almost instantly. I managed to eat two forkfuls of salad before the main meal came out.  So I had to set aside the salad to eat the meal while it was warm (shame it was not hot).  I had only eaten half my meal when the server came by to see if we were ready for dessert.  We said no (as might be obvious from our half-finished plates)  - at which point she left the bill and took off.    Overall the food was just fine - though not the best bbq I've had.  However, the service and meal timing was way off - which left a less than enjoyable dining experience.  Perhaps this was just a fluke so I woiuld be willing to try Lucille's again but I'm in no hurry to repeat that dining experience.",

Also got the baby back ribs 3 rib bones small in size but I thought the flavor was good, sweet and tangy sauce not over smoked meat was tender almost fall of the bone but still with a little bit of chew. The pulled pork was a bit of a disappointment for me it was less than a hand full on the plate but also lacked in flavor I smothered it in there BBQ sauce and it whent down well a bit on the tough side. my side order was a portion of Mac and cheese which I thought was very good pasta was done it was hot and cheese when it got to the table. I would have wanted those sweet teas to be a little sweeter I've visited the south a couple of times and these do not really come close. The staff as a whole was great more than one person came by trough the course of the meal to make sure we were OK, the waitress was nice and made sure we were not missing anything over all a decent restaurant maybe next time I will try the different foods but as far as BBQ I will continue the search.",

My husband and I ordered the deep fried shrimp appetizer. It was so good we ordered another one to come WITH our meal. It was perfectly seasoned and the jalapeno tartar sauce was to die for. I also ordered the back porch entree which was loaded w/ a half bbq chicken, tri trip, your choice of ribs and 2 sides. The meat was seasoned, tender and cooked to perfection. The sides were ok, and truth be told I don't buy a meal for the sides so I was fine. It was so much food you really get your money's worth. My husband ordered the catfish and shrimp which was an absolute delight. I would suggest to use the same breading as the deep fried shrimp appetizer, it's a winner!

The artichoke was my favorite. I love artichokes. Kid's ribs with shoe string fries, awesome. Mom's rib tips; she didn't make a sound. She was too busy eating.

    "text": "I have tried the location in Green Valley as take out only and really wasn't all that impressed with the food, but after hearing of other people's good experiences I decided to give it another go. What could be better, they have since opened a newer location (August 2013) much closer to my location in Red Rock, so it was easy to get to and a straight shot from my house.  Lucille's has two happy hours per day, and I was coming for their 9 till close option. I got there a bit early and hung out at the bar till 9, not an issue. When 9pm rolled around, we decided to move to a table, and I found out you HAD to sit in a special section only for it, odd but ok.   Wait staff was nice, but each one had some flaw that was a bit offputing. This evening I went each person had a habit of either talking down about their employer or it's food, which is a bit worrysome if you are just sitting down to eat and somebody has been saying some unsavory things that WORKS there.  The happy hour menu had a pretty good selection. We ordered drinks (which are also discounted) and found that one after the other we tried were not very strong and mostly syrup. I hope their full priced versions are a bit better, I kept my choices of drinks to a minimum. Everything tasted alright, but more commercially prepared and not something I would find myself coming back for. Wait staff was friendly, but our server did disappear from his section for a while. Each server introduced themselves as \"hi my name is \"x,\" and I'll be your server until \"y\" get's back from her break. We ended up having like three servers during the course of the night.   The complaints I have are minor, but after time even 2-3 minor items can add up to a less then perfect evening. Would I come back...maybe. Would I suggest to others...probably not. Not bad if you don't have all that many expectations. It was simply ok, just very unorganized and servers/bartenders seemed young and just there for a paycheck.",

    "text": "This place is AMAZING!! They have so many options that represent Georgia(home town) and if you have kids or planning to have kids, it is the best resturaunt to take them to.  It has so many options of different types of foods.  The service is 100% quick and at the end of each service even if you didn't order something with barbecue, they give you complimentary hot steaming towels.  If you have been to Las Vegas you understand the heat and the deserts and smoothies just hit the spot! I really recommend Lucciles barbecue for visitors and residents.  The waiters and waitresses have really good additudes and are friendly to visitors like me. They always try to start a conversation about home towns like mines O'ahu, Hawaii. Please visit this incredible yummy resturaunt.",

It was 10pm and not even close to busy. He never even bothered to clear our table. The BBQ was OK. The tri-tip was overcooked and the brisket was tough. I won't be back! To anyone looking to enjoy good service and BBQ, I would recommend dining at Famous Dave's. Much better value all the way around!",

Little did they know that I'm a food service director for a very large hospital. I informed them that I got a food borne illness. (95% of food borne illness is from feces on hands in the finger nails.) The lady at the restaurant said someone from corporate was gonna call me right away!! No one called for several days then when they did had attitude like I made this up. Or my facts weren't correct? So at this point I told them I'd like a refund, well they don't give refunds but can send me a gift certificate? Why the F would I ever eat there again. Then they had their insurance company call me to confirm that it wasn't from their food? After going back and forth I finally was able to make them get a supervisor cause my facts were correct and they couldn't price then False. I hung up cause their not worth my time. I'm a chef a grill master chef to be specific, from Texas. This place is an embarrassment to the culinary world!!",

    "text": "I waffled on writing a second review for this particular Lucille's, as I've written one for the other spot in Green Valley before. However, I feel like the experience here was different enough to warrant a location-specific review.   My other review mentions things like the quality of the meats, the sugar content of the everything, and the ever-presence of high fructose corn syrup. None of this has changed, and the food is still just \"A-OK\", as Yelp calls it. Not special, not outstanding, but also not bad and if you know what you're in for you will get exactly what you expect.  The difference in this review comes down to the building itself, the staff, and the bar.  First, the building seems either much larger or just better laid out. It isn't a great layout, but it *is* better than the one in The District in my opinion. There seems to be just more space, even if that space seems awkwardly placed.  Second, the staff at this particular one seems more friendly, happier to be at work. Maybe it's because they are a new place and none of the employees have become jaded corporate worker drones yet. Who knows?  Third, the bar. They mix the drinks stronger. It's as simple as that. Everything I've ordered at the one in The District has been delicious. Everything I've ordered at this one has been strong, tasted like mildly flavored booze instead of a mixed drink where the alcohol fades into the overall flavor. For some people that may be great, but I don't like the taste of well-quality alcohol and having it in the background of an otherwise delicious drink was a welcoming way to get a good night started.",

I ordered the two meat combo and so did my husband,  we both had baby back ribs and brisket, brisket was not as tender as I wanted it to be, ribs were delicious.   I had garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob, both were very good.   My husband had baked potato and bbq baked beans, both were very good and we would order the same sides again.

    "text": "First time here. We made 730p reservations for 6 people, but it changed to 7+2highchairs. We let the host know at 720p when we checked in, and she had such a nasty attitude and acted inconvenienced about us having added more people to our party. Kaela was her name, she rolled her eyes, told us it'd be a 25min wait which we understood. We ended up waiting 38 minutes for her to give us a table. Didn't surprise me since she couldn't have cared less about seating us to begin with anyways. For the host stand to say \"providing southern hospitality\" this host started us off with the nastiest taste in our mouths. She kept that foul looking face on the entire time we sat at the front and never updated us on the status of the table. Mind you, it was a Monday night. So certainly not busy to need us waiting as long as we did, post making a reservation. But despite the wait, that host was a total brat who doesn't deserve her job since she can't successfully perform it anyways. The food was okay. I'm not a fan of sugar on biscuits, and the kids pasta was bland and dry. But the corn was good as well as the burnt ends and wings. Our bar drinks took almost 15min to arrive to the table (one margarita and two beers). In fact, the appetizers were at the table before the drinks and the server forgot entirely the waters the three drinkers had asked for prior to them asking again. But our server was very friendly, everyone's order came correct. She went MIA throughout the entire meal and was very slow in coming back with boxes or the check. We ordered the \"best chocolate cake you'll ever have\", and it was less than impressive. Dry, and weird textured but at least we tried it! Overall I have zero intention of coming back and will definitely deter others from coming as well.",

He wanted to take me to his very favorite place Lucille's and I was open to the suggestion. The resterant for lunch time was oddly pretty empty. Clean environment. The hostesses were giggling like little school girls. My client really wanted a bigger booth and it seemed like it was such a chore for the red headed gal to place us there.    Our server was an awesome young man with glasses,he was quick and efficient. No complaints with him. Me and client both order different things. I happen to order the Wedge Salad,unfortunately it dose not specify on the menu it included a bacon on top, no big deal to me when I just sent it back when a female running server,brunette with short bobbed hair cut gave me the look of death. I read clients and work with people everyday so I can read people very well. She was reluctant but seemed mad. A minute later as we were placed in our booth next to the kitchen my client stops me and says do you hear them yelling in the kitchen about your salad. I was a little shocked but kept moving on because its my client's choice and I have big money running with this client business.   My chicken was not cooked extra dry/longer when I had asked. I was not surprised about the other reviews I have seen on here. If the client wants to take me there again thats fine as its his choice but not mine in the future at any time.",

I went as a last minute decision with my children and grandchildren. 2 who are 1 and 1 who is 2. We checked in and was told by the hostess it would be 15 minutes,  then she said 25 minutes which would have been an acceptable wait time. But time passed and it was almost 40 minutes, the kids were getting antsy and hungry and the hostess had no idea of how much time to tell customers the wait is. Well after an hour, and much complaining, the manager Jeff stepped in, got a table together for us right away and gave us appetizers and kids meals . I'm glad we waited because our server was excellent, and the food was great! Thank you Jeff, we will be back with a reservation!",

    "text": "This opinion may change when I give this place a second chance but for now here is how I feel.....I was really excited to try this place as I've been to their location in Southern California and loved my experience there so I did have high expectations for tonight.  When we first walked in the hostess informed us that \"it's a 20-30 minute wait\". We ask if we can eat at the bar and her reply was \"um yeah but last I checked it was full\" so we give her our name as we preferred a table but found a few seats at the bar. Then, as soon as we sit down at the bar, my mom gets the \"text message\" that our table was ready. This was my first sign that this restaurant hired an idiot for a hostess since that was only 5 minutes not 20. We went along and ended up at a table in the loudest part of the restaurant, that was a second sign that I was not going to enjoy this visit.  Then a random employee not sure what her position was but she took our drink orders and our server appeared right as she brought them to our table. She weirdly confirmed our drinks and then walked away and then finally came back a few minutes later to actually take our order. I found it very odd that when I told her I wanted the \"Smoked Chicken Pasta\" she had to confirm that was a real item on the menu, but then again their menu is large.  So then we waited with our two complimentary biscuits and waited and waited and about 45 minutes later we finally got our food! My mom ordered the Original Pulled Pork Sandwich but for some reason they gave her the Memphis which has cole slaw, but since we were both starving she didn't care and ate it anyway.   Now, when I read the menu I read the description as \"pepper\" not \"peppers\" so I didn't realize my food came with \"bell peppers\" which I am not a fan of. I tried to eat the dish instead of send it back but every bite became more and more disgusting and I just felt unsatisfied knowing that this dish was going to be $13.49 and I had to wait 45 minutes for it and it didn't even taste good to me since I dislike bell peppers and it was covered in them.  We let the waitress know that I was not a fan and reminded her that we were trying to make a movie that started in 20 minutes and after 15 minutes the manager finally arrived at our table. I spoke with him and he did the usual, \"oh we are sorry but is there anything else I can make for you\" but what upset me the most was when I mentioned how long it took he became defensive and just babbled until I reminded him that we were going to be late for our movie. He finally shut up and comped both our dishes so we ended up just paying for our drinks and I left a decent tip to be nice.  I'll give this place a second chance, but it won't be on a Saturday Night before a movie. At least all I missed were the previews.....",

Louis baby back pork ribs. Service is always excellent. The portions are usually too much for one person so you end up taking some home. I don't care much for grits but I love their cheese grits and collard greens. Highly recommend Lucille's barbeque if you haven't tried it.",

My favorites that I get every time we are there are the biscuits with apple butter (which they give you refills on) and the peach lemonade served in mason jars. I could drink mason jar after mason jar of that delicious nectar.The desserts are also equally as good. I love the banana pudding with wafers, also served in a mason jar! Other than those staples, I have tried multiple things off the menu, never had anything that wasn't good from BBQ to just plain old chicken tenders. We always bring guests here when they come to visit. Everyone always enjoys the atmosphere and the food. There is something for everyone on the menu.",

I was visualizing a typical fried chicken dinner with pieces of breast or drumstick or whatever....nope, this was more of a  chicken cutlet. Like, laying  flat on the plate.   Not really what I had in mind, but whatever.  So, just be aware  that if you order the fried chicken at Lucile's , that's what you get.  It came with a cream gravy which was okay....nothing special though.  The chicken was crispy but not hugely flavorful.  Finished the meal with the banana pudding for dessert.  Not bad, but not great either.  Overpriced for what it was, but that's pretty much the way things are these days, especially in casino restaurants.  Just \"meh\".  Maybe next time I'll order bbq.",

Starting with a mix-up at the hostess station, and continuing through a server who went on break as soon as we were seated, and ending in forgotten parts of the order ... The service wasn't up to the higher standard set by the green valley location.  The food was good enough, but hard to judge fairly through the lense of a bad experience.  I'll give them a '3', on the belief that it must be due to a misalignment of the stars.  After all it's a chain restaurant - it shouldn't be too much different from all the others!",

The baby back ribs are a little salty but really work well with shoes string & sweet potato fries with garlic mayonnaise.   Almost all of the food that I have tried at this location was great.",

Skinny margarita was excellent. And their honey blonde lage is also tasty. Only bad part was the fire alarm went off during our meal. It was extremely annoying. After asking several employees about it including a manager, they nonchalantly said it was the hotel and they couldn't do anything about. It was a little frustrating no sympathy, no apologies, just an oh well it happens all the time type attitude.  UPDATE: The owner reached out to me regarding my experience. He was understanding and will be reviewing the training practices for the employees for situations like this in the future. Excellent follow up and glad to know my opinion does count.  Thanks Brad.",

Cold slaw decent, didn't suck, no wow factor either. I had to go find my own damn silverware and napkin. Not once did the server ask if I wanted a refill for my beverage. It was exactly what I expected, pure mediocrity across the board, including 90% of the half assed attempt of outsider folk art on the walls and watered down blues on the sound system. I would have never stepped foot here, but met my folks and their friends. Lucille, your meal did not appeal.",

It really is a hit or miss here, more service wise but sometimes food wise. The majority of my dining is done in the day here. And we've come to the conclusion that sitting in the long big booths beside the bar are cursed. But in my restaurant world mind, I know why we usually get crappy service here. The bartender. This is the bartenders section and the day bartender always has sidework that has to be completed for the night bartender. SO their tables are a forethought in their mind. But I see her looking at us out of the corner of her eye and she's thinking let me finish this last lemon, or let me just finish prepping garnishes or re-filling mixers...but you took too long to finish and while we are here for a quick and speedy lunch, it always fails. We often have to ask for the biscuits, to tell her we are ready to order-which she probably already knows because as I said I saw her looking at us, for refills, the check, a box. As soon as the check dropped she was all smiles and thank you's. Nope, I don't fall for that and I am happy to educate the people that do not know better for they shall not be taken advantage of.   The food is good. The portions are either too small or ridiculously big! Once I got a BBQ chicken salad for lunch, it was served to me in a soup bowl. UGH! Half of it ended up on the table after having to cut the large lettuce pieces. It was a $10 salad in a soup bowl. Their lunch prices and items are decent selection.  On another visit I got, I think it was a special, BBQ chicken lettuce wraps. Could I have some more toppings with my lettuce. Thank you! But overall it lacked flavor anyway and I didn't finish it. The best things are their Fried Green Tomatoes with the Red Pepper Sauce! So yummy!   Let me say though, I have had dinner at this location once and everything was great that night, service and food!   Their drinks are probably the second best thing...their GIANT quart sized drinks will give you a sugar stroke if you are drinking pop but if you get their iced teas they are so good! Peach and Watermelon and they are not flavored with syrups! So they are unsweetened. That makes me a fan. The other is their cocktails while I've only had one at this location, Lucille's Big Peach, it was strong without being gross and I love peaches!   I'll be back, it's not awful but I hate that I have to be sure to ask for a certain sections and have to limit what's good and not good on the menu when I like everything!",

Overly priced, the portions were small, our biscuits were hard, and in general for the price, it did not seem worth it. The restaurant was almost empty, but it still took a long time for everything to come out. And we didn't order anything \"well done\" or anything that would be a reason for it to be so slow.  Service - Our server was nice and informative. But I saw him so busy running food to other tables, refilling drinks for other tables, even bussing other tables, it was hard to get his attention, when we needed things. I don't fault the server for this, it just seems unfortunate that a restaurant gives so many duties for a server when all they should be doing is working on customer service.   Most likely won't be back. I tried the Green Valley location a few years ago and enjoyed it, but this one wasn't up to par unfortunately",

The Irish nachos needed something to moisten or flavor them otherwise were bland. The waiter took our food menus away after taking our drink orders, forgot the silverware and got some of the order wrong. He even tried to reason out why it was a bad day. I'm in the service industry myself and it's simple and plain; if you're having a bad day, the customer doesn't care. No excuses.

    "text": "The darling Orchid had a taste for barbecue chicken last night.  So, with the help of Yelp, I find Lucille's.  I made a reservation on their web site, but never got the confirmation text the web site said I'd get.  Nonetheless, off to Lucille's we go.  We get there, and a fellow at the desk (named \"Abel,\" if I remember correctly) found our reservation in his computer, even though his computer said we left no phone number.  He said he'd bring that up in their next meeting for Corporate webmaster.  (And a few bonus points for a \"we'll fix it\" before I could even say, \"I think it's broken.\")  Having never been in there before, it was a learning experience.  Our waiter, a very pleasant fellow named \"John,\" was patient with us as we asked questions from all over the map, trying to get a feel for the place.  The Orchid ordered a half-chicken-plus-two-meats (rib tips and pulled pork) with cole slaw, roasted garlic mashed potatoes and BBQ beans. (Platter comes with two; we paid a couple bucks extra for three.)  I ordered the same chicken-plus-two, with sausage and burnt ends, and mac-n-cheese and cheesy grits.  The burnt ends weren't really \"burnt,\" but they were good.  The sausage was a classic Louisiana hot link; not bad, but I have never been a fan of the texture.  Learning experience; I'll know better for next time.  The Orchid loved everything on her plate.  John, and the entire crew, all looked as though they liked their jobs, and they all seemed to have two speeds: \"fast\" and \"ZOOM-what-was-that?\".  All in all, a very enjoyable experience, albeit one that we won't indulge in frequently (the food is worth what you're paying, but you do pay handsomely). Well done. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale:  90.",

It might have been--but from last year since the turkey and ham were so dry, hard, and tough.  It was like it had been micro-waved.  The sides were salty, and the gravy was thick as pudding. The sweet potato pie was fair.   The packaging was nice, but we wanted some good food and that didn't happen.  We won't return even though we use to like the pulled pork and ribs.  It's True what people say that it is a hit and miss there.  The sign of a good restaurant is that it is always good.",

Starting first with THE HOSTESS CANDACE who clearly doesn't know how to sit people accordingly. This is the same hostess I've read about in other reviews. Even if you make reservations she still manages to get it wrong. She will have you waiting for ever, so make sure to wake her up. She tends to fall into this I am so clueless kind of look( daydreaming). Not the brightest individual, clearly lacks common sense. But hey....what can you expect, it's CANDACE.      Oh and TOM the manager does not care one bit about his job. Lacks customer service BIG TIME!!! Don't even bother to tell him any bad situation you have encountered there. He might as well be known as CANDACE jr. He will look at you  and try to BS you with his awful explanations. I told TOM that I've been waiting for a table for a party of five. Which was suppose to be a 35 min wait. Turned out to be 1hr and 25min later. I asked him how hard is to accommodate 5 people here. He said that he didn't have anything available, yet as we are talking about this I see other parties of 4 go by and get seated. All of these parties came way after us being there. I told him I would call corporate and tell them the situation and that I would make sure to point him (TOM) and CANDACE out about how terrible and crappy their customer service is here. As soon as I said that, he then turned around like a little lost kid and all of a sudden there's a booth available. WOW!! Talk about getting caught in a lie, funny how they quickly changed as soon as I said I would be calling corporate. Which I still plan on doing! So thank you TOM-aka Candace jr. AND CANDACE FOR YOUR CRAPPY SERVICE WE HAD THERE AND FOR HELPING ME MAKE MY DECISION NOT TO COME BACK HERE AGAIN. Manager and the hostess here should get employee of the month for excellent crappy  service. Never once did he apologize about the inconvenience, but it's ok tho I believe in karma. Someone in a higher position will read this and it will come back haunt them. DON'T HURT THE BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT HAPPY THERE! It's individuals like you two that make individuals like me not want to come back here. I'll take my spendings elsewhere, plenty of other restaurants nearby.",

    "text": "I've dined in both Lucille's locations multiple times in Vegas because I am a fan of their beef ribs, onion straws, and their amazing biscuits with apple butter spread. However, I must say I prefer their Henderson location over the Red Rock Casino location due to their food preparation and customer service management. The staff at the Henderson location seem more attentive and efficient in my experience.  In any restaurant, especially barbecue, I always consider the time of day when dining in to get the freshest batch of succulent bbq ribs when made fresh. This location for me is hit or miss with their beef ribs. I am a \"moo\" rather than an \"oink\" kinda gal :) They are sometimes tender and juicy and other visits some parts of the beef ribs are not so edible friendly. However, both St. Louis and baby back ribs are always tender and flavorful. I prefer the flavor of the St. Louis ribs over the baby back ribs!  What I like about the ribs at Lucille's is that they are not too smokey for my palate compare to other local favorite bbq places around town. They offer lots of southern style sides that are delicious! Lucille's has 3 signature sauces on the tables in which the original sauce is easily my pick! They also have refreshing fruit flavored lemonade garnished with fresh fruits! Some may think prices here are overpriced, but portions are decent and some overwhelmingly huge which makes Lucille's a great place for sharing. This is my family's favorite place for BBQ. And do yourself a favor to call ahead or do an online reservation especially on weekends and holidays. This place can get super busy!",

Pulled pork sandwich came out with the bottom bun literally soaked through - disgusting. They remade it using a very thick brioche style bun that was all wrong for a pulled pork sandwich so I ate the meat without a bun. The meat was a C-minus at best. Tasted much more like a sloppy joe than bbq pulled pork. For the side I got macaroni and cheese which was also very disappointing. It's a very thin cheese sauce that has almost no flavor, topped with a little melted cheddar to cover it up but makes no difference on taste. The cost for our meal was $60 -_-",

    "text": "Our first time at the Red Rock Casino Lucille's location.  The seating was fast and friendly on a nice Monday all ate afternoon.  Hubby is a big fan of beef ribs and ordered the 5 Bone platter with sides of Mac and Cheese and Shoestring Fries.  Food was piping hot and tasty without being overcooked.    I had the \"Front Porch\" combo plate consisting of 1/2 Smoked Chicken, one link of Smoked Sausage, one Cheddar and Bacon Sausage Link and 2 Beef Ribs.  My sides were my usual choices:  Collard Greens and Cheesy Grits.  Again, everything was piping hot and delicious!  All in all it was a very good experience.  The only negative we have is the restaurant isn't laid out very well for a handicapped person using a motorized scooter...areas are tight and there isn't a restroom in the restaurant.  You have to leave the restaurant and go into the casino for the restroom.",

But why do they consistently not have bread ready to go, it usually comes out with the entrees or right before the entree is served.  Not necessarily the best BBQ out there, I prefer to go \"rollin\" elsewhere but these are still prepared well.  I only get ribs when I go to BBQ places so I'm not sure if the other items are just A-Ok.",

We always order the Backyard Family Feast when we eat at Lucille's, but today was the first time ordering take out.    They don't do multiple sauces and they don't give extra orders of biscuits.  Doesn't make sense to me.",

We ordered the fried pickles and the breeding was just falling off to the point I just grabbed the pickle out and ate it that way.  We both ordered the pulled pork sandwiches I got mine original style he did the other option they had with coleslaw. Before putting any BBQ sauce from the table the pulled pork didn't have ugh flavor it was pretty bland. I added my favorite of their BBQ sauce and it was fine. I'm an original BBQ sauce fan of theirs however I didn't realize they really depend on it for the flavor of their pulled pork.  My side was the honey peanut coleslaw and that was amazing. The garlic mashed potatoes was also delicious.  My decision for 3 stars is based on the entire place as a whole my main course shouldn't be bland if you're a BBQ place yet everything else is spot on.",

But on my past couple of visits the spare ribs were so small they look like baby backs, and to make matters worse, they were overcooked and dry. They rely too much on their sauce.  I really hope they'll get back to the aficionado attention they used to give barbecue in the early days. I'll try them again, but if they disappoint me with the ribs again this love affair will be over.",

I went to Lucille's in Vegas. HOLY PETE! This is Texan style bbq= the real deal. Warm, moist fork tender brisket, sausages, ribs, steaks, even a lil chicken...I do not do fish, so did not even look to see if they serve it...ew. Rich tomato based BBQ sauce in the standard Texan rich and thick style, and they offer two others a spicy and a something or other= I was busy with the rich and thick.. Fresh made from scratch warm corn bread, real butter, real bbq beans, you know the kind with strips of beef in them.... sweet potato fries, reg fries, mashed taters, tater taters, garlic taters, crisp fresh salads, including tater,  real, home brewed tea- sweetened or not..... beer, wine,.... and a fabulous desert menu. Don't say you heard it from me, but schooch over Rudy's, mamas got a new bbq love! There are a couple of locations, I have only ever been to this one. It just occurred to me... I may be a bbq addict.",

    "text": "By far the WORST service we ever received in any restaurant. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is that our food was good. We called ahead for a table for 8. I was told 45 min wait. Fine - we show up and waited 15 minutes longer (total 60 min) We were seated next to a large group of kids and a wall. We ordered our drinks, It was so tight the wait staff couldn't even serve water to us. While we were waiting for our beer and appetizers, (We never received the complimentary biscuits) I asked the hostess if we could be moved to another larger table, they seemed very put out and they let me know that it was disruptive to the staff. They had to change servers since the new table was 6 ft away. After moving and waiting 15 (yes fifteen) I asked the server if we could please get our beer, and the lemon we had asked for our water. I also reminded her about the biscuits. I was told they were coming. Another server brought us our appetizer, sat it on the table and walked away. Were we supposed to eat off of the table? So we waited until someone came by, I asked for plates and again asked for our beer and lemon. We were brought out salads, that was messed up too. By that time, we gave up on the biscuits. I excused myself and asked to speak to the manager. I expressed my concerns, he apologized and said he would stop by the table. We finished our dinner, apologized to the server for being apparently so difficult. Before leaving I asked for the biscuits we should've received at the beginning of our meal to go. The manager NEVER came by to say anything to my family. There were so many other instances of poor service, from refills, to us not being offered additional plates for the kids, no warm towels offered at the end of our meal, on and on. Very disappointed in this particular restaurant, but I still reluctantly tipped the server a minimum 15% gratuity. I won't be back. Ever.   I guess since it's LV, they assume we won't be regular guests, but to their dismay my sister lives here near Red Rock and strongly suggested she will never eat there again. Too bad, since we regularly try to support the business's in our neighborhoods.",

You think she would've given us a complimentary treat or comp'd some sort of the meal but no. Anyways we went home and are and first off the corn bread was dryer than bark and had way too much corn inside it reminded me of corn on the cob. . The meat was way over cooked and drenched in bbq sauce. I ordered a well done brisket burger and was cooked medium and I can't stand any pink in my burger. My wife ordered a pulled brisket sandwich and she said it tasted way too sweet and sugary . Oh and by the way they serve you rocks (biscuits) with a sugar butter. Tasted like I took a spoon and took a bite of pure flour. The mac n cheese looked like mashed potatoes and was very mushy. The mashed potatoes tasted way too garlicy. I'm just happy we had a gift card and ordered for take out because if I ate there I'm sure I would've been more miserable and would've definitely said something to the waitress. Anyways if anyone wants real bbq I suggest Rollin Smoke bbq. Best bbq in Vegas in my opinion.",

Although, I hear the original in TX is much better.  One of the reasons I like Lucille's is that they have beef ribs, which is not always plentiful at other restaurants.  A few years ago I went on a BBQ adventure of sorts and drove around Texas and the south trying to hunt down the best BBQ. And while Lucille's is not authentic in that it is smothered and basted in BBQ sauce, I still like it.  The sauce is a little sweet, and they have memphis, original and spicy sauce bottles on each table for more.  The portions are large and the sides are tasty. Last night we had the baked beans which had large pieces of pork in them and the cheesy grits - I love the grits. They remind me of the cheese grits I had when I was first introduced to cheese grits in South Carolina. Also, their iced tea is fresh brewed and they provide biscuits with a sprinkle of sugar on top and apple butter upon request. As to portion size I would almost say that they are almost the Claim Jumper of BBQ.",

I have 3 times out of 3 waited at least 5 minutes to get my tab paid. The system used is ill conceived. I understood when they first opened. Last week (Jan 28, 2014) after waiting 8 minutes to pay the tab, is inexcusable. They also have not had the food ready by the time they suggest I come. This also needs to be ironed out. I have never eaten at the restaurant, so I can not comment. So excellent, tasty food that is a bit too pricey, is still well worth the likely wait you will encounter when you pick up the food.",

I sat at the bar and it was happy hour, so great prices on appetizers and drinks. I ordered a cocktail and my favorite, fried pickles. So far all is great! After finishing my pickles it seemed like a while before my sandwich came but the sandwich would be worth the wait. I get the brisket and portobello sandwich usually so yummy. The sandwich finally comes, I pick it up and oh no, the bottom bread is all soggy. It must have been sitting for a while. I eat around the soggy part, the rest is still good and the Mac and cheese was delicious. I finish what I can and decide I will get my dessert to go. We'll, when I arrived there were 2 bartenders and the guy that took my order was on it, he took my order, made my drink and he was very nice. Shortly after my pickles came he disappeared and the girl that was taking care of the other side of the bar didn't seem to have any customer service skills at all. When she cleared my plate and drink glass she did ask if I wanted more water. She filled it and then pushed my tab in front of me. I waited a few minutes and then figured I might as well order my cheesecake from the take out window, so I got out my card to pay. I told her I had wanted to order cheesecake but then I changed my mind. I know she was working the whole bar by herself but really! A few days later I got my cheesecake from the one in Henderson, they were very nice. I will probably give them another chance but might not sit at the bar.",

The lady at Red Rock did not know so she transferred me to Lucille's where the guy that answered the phone gave me a very curt \"no patio\" and hung up before I could ask anything else!  He didn't even say \"bye\" he just hung up as I was speaking.  Seriously?

We were sat in a booth and it was freezing, not just cold. I would say it was at best 60 degrees, not enjoyable when you are trying to eat. Our waitress came over after 5 mins. at which time I asked about it being so cold, she response was the casino controls it but the servers love it because we get hot and it feels good, but not to worry that was the only cold spot in the resturant (judging by the people in jackets, in vegas, in summer, that was a lie) We ordered drinks, and when she brought them 10.mins later  we ordered an appatizer platter as well as our food. After 15 mins our food comes out, but no appetizer.  Our waitress is no where to be found, so we grab another waiter and tell him, we go ahead and eat because it's so cold our food is getting cold. My sister goes to take a drink of her sweet tea and there is fruit flies frozen into the ice. At this point myself and my food are frozen and I'm pretty upset. 15 mins. Go buy (Still no appetizer) and our waitress shows up and says, \"yeah so your appetizer is coming, I charged you for it so it's on its way\" I say ok that's fine but there is bugs in this drink, she looks in it and says \"oh, it's just fruit files, we have a problem with them because of the bar, did you maybe want a new drink?\" Of course we wanted a new drink, that is gross. She takes the drink, 2 mins. Later our appetizer comes out, now that we are almost done with dinner. 6 mins go buy before she brings the new drink back. I was pretty mad so I asked for the manager, who I tell the story too his reply was sorry we don't control the air. No mention of sorry there were bugs in your drink, or your food got cold, nothing. It really made me mad and I told him we would never be back and I was calling corporate. When our check came he had taken our appetizer off the check. I will never go back again, I should have paid more attention to the yelp reviews about this place. Good food does not make up for horrible service.",

Pulled pork is delicious and so tender, same with the tri tip, the chicken is just right.  Large portions, we ordered a half order of onion straws and it was enough for 8 people, easy.  Very tasty, light and crispy.  The BBQ shrimp was a little spicy but good.  The drinks are great and also on the large side.  There BBQ sauce is really good, 3 different types of hot.  Always a pleasure to dine here.",

    "text": "Had a good morning playing Hold 'Em at Red Rock and noticed they have a Lucille's now. I'm a BBQ fanatic, so a visit on the way out seemed in order.  Staff was awesome...extremely attentive and friendly. Was seated and waited on promptly.  Went with the lunch BBQ platter, which includes three meats. Chose a hot link, beef tri-tip, and baby back ribs.  The sausage was absolutely off the hook...spicy and succulent. One of the best I have ever had.  The tri-tip was excellent as well: perfectly cooked, sliced, and the dipping sauce was delicious.  The baby back ribs were a major disappointment. Overcooked, dry, and stringy. The local pitmaster really needs to be more attentive to this...when a restaurant identifies itself as a BBQ, ribs need to be cooked competently.  Not sure whether I like the sugar dusted biscuits...tasty, but I'm more of a cornbread guy. Mac and cheese side was absolutely solid...not the best I've had, but a solid four stars in any foodies book.  No room for desert this time...will try again in a couple of weeks and focus on all three styles of ribs offered to see if the pitmaster gets his 'Q act together.  ===================================================  Second visit. One week later.  Had the three meat combo again, this time with St. Louis ribs, 1/4 chicken and another off-the-hook hot link. The ribs were very good...smoked just right. The chicken was fine, but nothing exceptional. Link was just as good as the first I had. Baked been side was a bit on the sweet side...a little more kick would have balanced it out perfectly.  Had the banana pudding to top things off...in a word, WONDERFUL.  One weird thing. Sat at a table by the bar...when the A/C kicked in you could feel the floor vibrate. Odd, but I can live with it. Going back in a few days to give the baby backs another chance.",

They start you off with these fresh biscuits that come with whipped apple butter. For the appetizers, you should definitely try the fried green tomatoes. My boyfriend's favorite is the Mardi Gras chicken. It is easily one of the best dishes on their menu. I mean, look at that picture I posted. Serious shit, my friends(I mean that in the best way possible). I love the blackened catfish. It comes perfectly cooked, smoked, and seasoned. It is one of my favorites. This place never lets me down. If you are ever in the red rock casino don't hesitate to stop by this place. You won't be disappointed.",

She seemed not to care her response was did you want me to heat the side dishes? You think? Wow  Would never go there again.  Ps the bbq sauce was blah. So if you like cold, plain food go there.

It took about 20 minutes to get our warm biscuits with Apple Cinnamon Butter  that I had been craving since my first visit.  We shared the St Louis rib platter that came with 2 sides.  The ribs were meaty and tender.  I actually preferred them over the Baby Back ribs. The sweet potato fries were ok.  The Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw was a little too acidic.  We were brought out warm towels for our hands at the end of our meal.  We had a $5 off coupon for signing up for their Preferred Guest emails.  One of the managers took off the discount on our bill.  We will be back for the biscuits and Apple Cinnamon Butter.",

I had to go back to the hostess to get menus!! That is when our initial server came to take our drink order. There was no introduction or anything she just said what do you want to drink (no eye contact EVER made throughout the entire time here). I ordered two waters with lemon and was going to order a margarita and she literally walked off while we were talking. Following this incident, they tried to move us away from happy hour to be serviced. Why should we have to move to have our order taken if we were directed to sit here? After we had a change of 3 more different servers. Not to mention it took AN HOUR to receive any good. Wow. Cannot believe it. I would like to add that server Cody was exceptional despite our horrible experience here.",

But it's definitely not the \"home-cooked\" quality I would hope for. The ribs are mediocre at best. The chicken is very juicy and very good. The burnt ends are awesome! Make sure to get a biscuit and spread some apple butter on it... DELISH! The banana pudding is AMAZING. My favorite dessert on the entire dessert menu.  I would definitely recommend for people to eat here. It's very good for the price you pay!",

    "text": "One word review: Meh.  Three word review: Meh, at best.  I was pretty excited to try this place- obviously I had my initial \"BBQ in Vegas?\" skepticism, but then it seemed to get a lot of positive reviews on yelp. I live close to the Red Rock so having a good BBQ joint in the neighborhood would of been pretty awesome.   We arrived around 6pm and the place was pretty empty- not a good sign since the Red Rock itself was pretty packed. Despite being nearly empty it still took about 10 minutes to get a table as the 3 staff working the door discussed the conundrum of where to sit us over their headsets with the mothership. It was another 10 minutes before someone took our order.   Wanting to try a bunch of stuff we decided to get the App sampler which includes sweet potato fries, fried pickles, rib tips, okra, chicken tender, some sort of southern egg roll, sausage link, and some other unidentifiable food stuffs. It was all about the quality you would expect from making the same items at home in 1 oven at the same time by just guessing at what temperature would best suit all items. Sweet potato fries were mushy, fried pickles were tough, rib tips had bones in them and were tough, sausage was cold. Overall very dissapointing.  I also ordered the Brisket chili which was on the special menu- figuring after the app platter I wouldn't be able to tackle a whole rack of ribs, perhaps an error I admit. The chili was just very bland and only lukewarm. The cornbread that came with it was very dry.   Throughout the meal service was slow, and despite the jars they bring the water in being enormous I was frequently without a drink which is a pet peeve. for 24 dollars a person it was on the expensive side for BBQ, with low quality.",

When Lucille's was suggested, I didn't get too excited but I was willing to give it a try.   We arrived in a Friday arrived 5 for a party of 8. The hostess was great and suggested we look at the menu and let us know it would be about 15 minutes. Though it took almost 25 minutes to get seated, it ended up being worth it. We were seated right in between the kitchen entrance and the smoker which worried me at first. But it gave us the best seat on the house to see (and smell) all of the meat. Plus, we were constantly checked on by the flow of staff going by our table.   Our drinks and appetizers were quickly served and everything looked great! I was overly excited about my sweet tea (which they perfected) and the sangria. There was an assortment of beers at the table that all got the thumbs up. And those sugary biscuits. Oh my!! I could have ate the biscuits and drank my sweet tea all night. I really hate to say that I didn't bother with the butter. I was temporarily in a sugar high and my vision was clouded.   Once the food started coming out, we were ready to get our hands dirty. Since my southern twang was out in full force, I went for the southern fried chicken sandwich. Even the smell of the bbq could stop me. And that was the best choice. That had to be the best chicken sandwich I've had in a long time. The brisket from the table that I sampled only confirmed that I had made the right decision with the sandwich. And unfortunately even the greens were blah. And there was no salt on the table so they eventually got cold and weren't eaten.   Our waitress was amazing. The food was overpriced but nothing to deep to keep me away.",

Being seated quite quickly for lunch we were greeted by the server, she apologized straight away for the construction outside. Didn't even realize until she said anything.  So to start we grabbed the Peach lemonade, and id like to say that even though it was a non alcoholic drink it was pretty amazing.  Grabbing the Chicken and Pull Pork with a side of Sweet Potato Mash I dug in right away. Both the chicken and pork had a great smokey flavor to the them with the chicken nice and juicey. The surprise of the meal was the Sweet Potato mash!!! Highly recommend if your unsure of a side.  Overall The service was good, the food wasn't bad and the business was clean. I can't say it was the best BBQ dishes I've ever had, but I'd say it's on par with famous Dave's or alike",

    "text": "Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que is decent but overpriced. Let's be real for a minute, this place is a chain, and as much as I like coming here for quick BBQ it's still turn and burn, get people in and get people out as fast as you can for as much money as you can. I wouldn't say that it's the fast food of BBQ that would be taking it too far but it really is as close as you can get to it without crossing that line. When I say it's overpriced i'm saying it's overpriced for what you're getting because it's not the best quality food or cuts of meat for the price you pay. For example, the Grilled Salmon here at Lucille's is $22.99 and one of my favorite items on the menu. It's a salmon fillet seasoned and hickory smoked or grilled. Served with New Orleans mustard cream sauce, Creole rice and fresh vegetables. It's good but it's not wild caught, and for $22.99 it should be. If places like Bone Fish Grill can sell Fresh Wild Caught Sockeye Salmon for $24.00, then so can Lucille's but they won't. I guess that's what happens when your business is solely profit driven. For these prices the meat should be grass fed with no hormones or antibiotics, the chicken should be organic free range, the fish should be wild caught. I'm not really trying to harp on Lucille's because I do enjoy their food I'm simply stating that they are absolutely overpriced for what you get that's all. Anyway back to the food the hot links are great and something I always order regardless of what entree I order. One of my favorite things to order is the Lucille's BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich slow smoked, Certified Angus Beef tri tip, hand carved, tossed in mop sauce and piled on a soft brioche bun. When it comes to BBQ I like to order the Smoked BBQ Half Chicken which is a house favorite. Half of a fresh chicken, marinated in their lip smackin' BBQ sauce for 24 hours, slow smoked to perfection and finished on the grill. When it comes to ribs they offer three different types Baby Back Ribs, St. Louis Spare Ribs and my go to personal favorite is their BBQ Beef Ribs. My two favorite sides are the Cornbread and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and when the Cornbread is hot and fresh it's delicious. Lastly I wash everything down with a giant mason jar full of fresh brewed Sweet Tea!",

So we entered and went to the bar, the place is big, but we didn't come at the busy peak time which to me was good. Our bartender who I literally forgot her name was awesome and down to earth. She frequently checked on us for drinks, biscuits, and some menu's. The biscuits were free and the food was awesome.        I had the fried chicken which was excellent, the only thing I will do next time is ask for no garlic lol, cause wow the next day my breath was kicking. My buddy had the spare rips and spicy hot link, he explained it was excellent as well.        Between the service and taste of food and menu choices I say 5 stars. I've been to places that were BBQ places and crummy service and food, but here is the total opposite.",

I haven't eaten one in years so I was curious to try it and we were at Red Rock to meet some friends.   We came during Happy Hour at the bar area which includes drink specials and discounted appetizers (everyday 4 ) Off that menu we got fried pickle spears which had good flavor and came crunchy and hot, but a bit harder to eat than pickle rounds as the batter flaked off.   We shared a half chicken plus (2 meat) hot link and pulled pork platter. The chicken and hot link were decent enough, but the pulled pork was a dried out mess. It includes two sides; I enjoyed their baked beans as it was tangy and sweet and the potato salad was standard, but good. We upgraded our biscuits to cornbread which was a generous portion and I enjoyed it.   I enjoy the fact they have various kinds of sweet tea and lemonade. I had the watermelon tea which is mildly flavored with fresh watermelon and doesn't come sweetened but very good.   Service was rather good. She checked on us, we got drink refills and the check all before we needed to ask for it.   I find I enjoy more their sides than their BBQ here. I find that their BBQ taste just fine and that there are better BBQ spots out there. Is it weird that they have a indoor smoker and it doesnt smell of even a hint of smoke? I think I might stick to a la carte sides, appetizers during happy hour and their flavored teas and lemonade.",

Really Lucille's this is nuts. We used to really look forward to date nights here but we won't be back!!! This place is the bomb! Try the fried shrimp app with the jalapeno tarter... delicious!!! For dinner my husband swears by the Louisiana pasta. I had the baby back ribs and burnt end brisket. OMG it was soooooo good! Not to mention their biscuits and apple butter. Yum yum!!!",

We will be giving this restaurant a second chance, so the review could change again.   So sad to have to leave a negative review, but our visit was just awful. Our waitress was so rude. We were a large party, which apparently annoyed her. She took our order and went off. We didn't see her again until she brought our salads, which had no dressing. We waited another 15 minutes to get someone to bring us dressing. They brought the dressing with our meals. So that ruined the point of the salad. Then I had to take my kiddo to the bathroom & the waitress took my almost untouched meal and threw it away because \"she thought I was done\". No apology, no offer to bring me anything else. Such a disappointment. We have been to this location a few times and the service was AWFUL! We will not be back.",

Inside was jumping with live music and large TV displays and decorated with a western theme with large wooden booths and tables.   We were seated promptly however it did take a long time for the waiter to acknowledge us we needed to flag someone down to take our order I had to minus a star. After that the service was better and the food was amazing.   The half portion of the appetizer platter was perfect for the 3 of us Pork Rib tips,  fried dill pickles, sweet potato fries, fried green tomatoes, egg rolls,  fried okra,  chicken strip and hot links. It was all very tasty and perfect if you want to try various things.   We ordered BBQ shrimp, beef brisket and a bbq rib combo platter.  It came with choices of sides. I had the sweet potato fries which was awesome perfectly crunchy and seasoned I'm the outside and sweet and soft on the inside. The brisket was very tasty and you can tell that they have their own smoker in house and they smoke it there.  The ribs were amazing too! For a restaurant attached to a casino I was very impressed. The complimentary biscuits that they serve are deliciously homemade and I had to stop myself from eating too much. Unfortunately unable to try a dessert I was too full from dinner. Highly recommended, the BBQ was really good and those bisquits and sweet potato fries were winners!",

Came for dinner to celebrate a friends bday, we made sure he knew it was her bday early on, and he said he'd bring out a chocolate cake. THE CAKE NEVER CAME, even when he was reminded.  Food was eh.. onions straws tasted more like grease rather than onion.. burnt ends were really bland. A friend ordered a burger and made a point to the waiter \"ABSOLUTELY NO PICKLES\"... her burger came out and their were pickles. He tried to be funny about it and crack jokes about how he was gonna go to the back and shove a pickle up someones ass, not funny.. and he continued to stand there trying to be funny. In the end she took the pickles off and dried pickles juice with her napkin, but if it was an allergy issue, they would be having a lot of big problems right about now. He did get his manager to comp the burger which was fair. Overall, bar area, restaurant, tables, etc.. very clean. Still wouldnt come back, theres a lot of great. bbq spots out there with bigger portions and tastier food.",

    "text": "We went last night after the hockey game. We have been a few times before and it was nice. I usually have the brisket and both times before it was done perfectly. Unfortunately, one bad experience can ruin the entire opinion .   When we sat down we were greeted by Diiiiiii. She was very abrupt and seemed annoyed. Granted, it was busy, but that isn't an excuse for a bad attitude. We had a few minutes left before happy hour was over, so we thought we would have a few cocktails to get started. As we tried to order we immediately started getting pushback on every request. I asked for the Jameson ginger. When I asked if I could have 2 in the same glass she said \"No, but I can bring you a double. Won't be happy hour though\". Then our fried wanted a beer and asked if she could get two since happy hour was over in a few minutes. She almost rudely said \"no, we don't let you back them up.\"  Our friend then said, well please bring me the first one which I will drink and then I can order another before happy hour is over. She didn't like that idea either.   It was a bit and we finally got our biscuits, one for each of us. A second batch was never offered or brought.   Then our meals arrived. The food wasn't bad, but not as good as the last few times. Then we discovered that we were missing two sets of silverware.   Diiiiii came by after we got our food and asked if everything arrived okay. We said yes. Our friend again asked for her second beer. She walked away from the table without a response. Later, she eventually brought that second one.   We picked up on her bad attitude the second she walked up to the table. We tried to make small talk and it wasn't happening. Throughout our time there it was obvious that we were more trouble than she was willing to give. We have not been treated this rudely or coarsly at a restaurant anywhere in town. We really like Station casinos, but are unlikely to return to Lucille's any time soon.   We are locals and eat out often. We are not cheap and we spend a lot of money eating out. We also eat out oftentimes with friends, and we have almost always been treated very well. We are a gregarious group of friends and we usually tip very well. Last night was the first time ever that I stiffed a server for any reason, but she deserved it.",

I've come here both times for Happy Hour.   I'm very skeptical about franchise BBQ spots. But, what stands out to me about both places is the flavor of Gumbo. The people I was with also enjoyed the Gumbo. I can only imagine if they had crab in it.   However, the burnt ends, was a major fail. Wasn't burnt and all Fat. Not much flavor to it. The deviled eggs were just okay.   So, I was told there's a Lucille's in Concord, Ca which is about a 30 min drive from me, I will try their actual menu there. Also found out the story of Lucille is actually made up.",

    "text": "It's the little things that bring me here like their Fried Green Tomatoes and my mom not wanting to leave the slots so I figured we should do dinner while we wait. This Luciille's is in the  Red Rock Casino so if you are with people who are gambling you can simply sit it out and have a meal instead.   When ever I come here I start with the Fried Green Tomatoes because it's rare that I find it in any of the restaurants I go to. Truthfully ever since I read the book \" Fried Green Tomatoes \" in high school I've liked this dish and it's trouble some to make so I'm glad Lucilles offers this as an appetizer. The tomatoes are fried in what looks like cornmeal it's crispy and the sauce is cream based. I doubt if they are fried in bacon grease like it states in the book but hey are still delightful!   I decided to get another appetizer so I can get exactly what I want so I ordered their fried shrimp. I know that it is two fried things in a row but trust me I'm southern at heart! I prefer their mustard dip to the tarter sauce because it's has a little more kick to it.   It was my birthday month so my husband mentioned my birthday and they also sent out a colorful birthday treat . Chocolate cake , vanillia ice cream with sprinkles ! Yum!   Our server was awesome he kept checking on us and tended to everything we needed from more bread , refills etc. He also packed us more bread and honey butter to go. Excellent service !",

We walked by a couple with amazing looking baby back ribs. I am making a point to include a happy hour menu with drink before I scarf down the biscuits with apple butter. I'm so bad about eating THEN remembering to take the photo!! So here goes.  Food was great. Food great. Very casual and fun atmosphere. The drinks were HUGE. I ordered a strawberry lemonade here. Very good. Very strong. Danielle was our bar server and she was very friendly and informative letting let us know they smoke meats here in house and make their own sauces. Very cool. Then I took a photo of the bbq rib tips.  EXCELLENT. OMG.  Then I looked on the website and I see delivery for $1.99 so I suspect this would be a good place to order a delivery or to go order from. There's so much going on here that we will be back.",

When I go out to eat I'm there for one thing, to eat and service is not something that I can eat. Why people spend so much time harping on this - for any restaurant - is beyond me. That said I've always had good service here. I mean, whaddya want, these people are overworked and underpaid (restaurant employees). Everyone is due a bad night. Not making excuses but try to keep things in perspective, this isn't Le Cirque. And even if it were it's still just a restaurant, you're not having surgery performed. We LOVE bbq and have been to some of the most notable cities for this in the country; Austin, Nashville, the Carolinas, KC, etc and Lucille's is what we're always comparing them to. The quality and consistency is something to be admired. And no, it isn't cheap but guess what, the one we go to is in Red Rocks Casino where a Starbucks tall coffee costs nearly $6. That's what happens in casinos. I find that people love to complain with their mouths full...pathetic.",

Will think hard before going back   Well went back about two weeks ago service was okay had to ask for refills the bbq beef was a bit too chewy the steak salad was so so      Did not want to try a dessert.

This time the TV was so loud that I could not hear the people at my table and the frantic cadence of the sports announcer was the opposite of relaxing.   If I had wanted to go to a sports bar I would have. I didn't I came to Lucilles instead and ended up being subjected to the loud yammering of a sports announcer.

The peach one is delicious too by the way. I ordered the half smoked chicken with a side of greens & corn bread. It was so filling! I couldn't really eat the greens because it had too much bits of pork in there. The flavor was great though. The chicken was nicely smoked, juicy and super tender. Would definitely get that again. I ordered a side of the fried okra too because I love my okra. I would definitely recommend it! Our server \"house\" was so awesome. His real name is Justin and he was just on top of things when it comes to making us comfortable and letting us know what's up. He brought out a good amount of the biscuits and the apple butter. Uhhhh.. heaven! Lol! Love that stuff. Everything was great and you really can't go wrong with the bbq. Excited to get some more lemonade! Generous amount of it in a serving :) happy eating my Yelpers!",

We decided Thanksgiving was as good a day as any to check this place out for some Thanksgiving dinner...even though we went for lunch. They take reservations both online and via phone, which was great for us because I had to ensure that I had enough time to eat and then go to work afterwards.   Lucille's Thanksgiving dinner meal consisted of turkey or honey ham (of half of each, which is what we got) with gravy, green bean casserole, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, biscuits w/ apple butter and a small personal pumpkin pie. The food was delicious and we even had leftovers because we couldn't finish it. The best part was the personal pie that was amazingly creamy and served with tons of whipped cream.  The staff was nice and I like how they work as a team instead of customers only being able to flag down their assigned waiter/waitress like traditional restaurants. I also loved that they had TVs everywhere in the dining area so we were able to catch glipses of the Thanksgiving Day parade and football game while we were there. Definitely will be back to have some of their more traditional BBQ grub!",

We saw her standing at the bar waiting for it while the bartender was watching tv & making idle conversation with a couple seated at the bar.   Also I had to ask her twice for a to-go cup for my sweet tea and by the time she brought it, my tea was almost gone. She didn't offer to fill up the to-go cup with fresh tea.

    "text": "Great spot with the casino.   Parking can be problematic on the weekend's due to traffic and the crowds.  It's one of the largest Lucille's I've been to, even compared to the ones in California.  The hostess and waiters are friendly and the service is fast.  One thing they could offer is lunch menus on the weekends, or at least on Saturday's. Not everyone wants a full size meal in the afternoon, and sometimes I don't want to resort to a burger just so I don't get a full size meal.   At least the food is always great and the drinks too!  And who can resist their delicious biscuits and apple butter.  Absolutely scrumptious!",

It's right next to Costco, Best Buy, Downtown Summerlin and the movies! So for us, it's the location that gets us.   Not only is the location prime, but the food quality and service is great! It's a great place to have bigger parties gather because of the space and portions! We went around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and there were larger parties already seated, but we were seated quite quickly.   Our waiter, Michael, was excellent! Though he was swamped with a larger party in the back of the restaurant he did an excellent job managing our table and needs. The service was great especially for the amount of people there.   The food was like usual, great! We ordered the onion strings for an appetizer and let me tell you, it defeated us! We were 6 hungry people but geez the portion was huge! We also order tons of ribs and chicken -- let's just say Lucille's took this one and we admitted defeat. Lots of to go boxes were necessary! Especially with those warm biscuits served up with the apple butter! You just can't get enough!",

Now the food: Sauces are garbage and taste like synthetic preservatives,  the meat was cooked decently but you could definetly tell they were baking under heat lamps for a while cause they were pretty dried out.. Strawberry lemonade was fore though. .. I think they literally only came to ask how we were doing once. Idk,  there are WAY better bbq spots with much better food and prices. It's a shame rich folk think this is good bbq. Hell, famous Daves is better for Christ's sake.",

    "text": "I haven't been to a Lucille's for a pretty long time. I would say the last time was 4-5 years ago when I lived in California and when it was actually really good. The husband and I were at Red Rock and we decided to eat here, since we ate at Yard House not too long ago at The Linq. We were seated right away on a Sunday afternoon, but service was a bit slow. Our waitress was friendly and always had a smile on her face, but it seemed like she disappeared for a long time while we were waiting. She also forgot about the beer that my husband ordered, so we had to remind her when she brought out our food.  I ordered the pulled pork sliders, and geez, they were horrible! The sweet rolls were very soggy from the beginning. I decided to push those off to the side and just eat the pork by itself. But then the pork was waaayy to salty. It was like they went overboard with the sauce, then decided to dump even more salt over it! Even the sweet potato fries were very salty and over cooked. I can't remember what it was called, but my husband ordered some kind of meat combo and said it tasted fine. So I'm not sure if I just happened to come in on a day that the pulled pork was pure crap?   The only highlight of this place was the sweet tea and the Totsie Roll Pops, so 2 stars for that! After we finished eating, there were flies flying around our food. I understand that the restaurant has no control over that, since they can come in whenever someone opens the doors, but it's still annoying. At least they weren't around while we were eating.  Well, I gave Lucille's another chance, but won't be back! There are definitely better bbq places here in Vegas! It's sad how this chain has gone sooo downhill.",

When it opened at Red Rock near us I was thrilled! Unfortunately the quality isn't the same. It's as if the magic touch was lost at the new location. Last night our tea was so bitter it was sent back, the biscuits were burned & hard & at that point I told myself no more trips to this location. Not sure what's going on but it's not the first time we had issues here. We always voice our concerns but I don't see improvements.  Looks like we'll occasionally make our way across town because we did always enjoy the other location. I hope they eventually get their act together.",

    "text": "We took the family to Lucille's over the weekend in an effort to satisfy a lingering BBQ craving.  Upon entering we enjoyed the pungent smoky/salty/sweet aromas of a mixture of meats that caused us to salivate like Pavlov's dogs.  After checking in with the hostess we were sat fairly quickly in one of the back room's booths.  We ordered a round of drinks (Blueberry Bliss Margaritas) and decided to start with the Fried Green Tomatoes and Roasted Artichokes however the server informed us that they were out of the artichokes.  For our main courses, we ordered the Beef Ribs, BBQ Sauteed Shrimp, Kid's Pizza and 2 orders of Mac N Cheese.  Our server was very nice and attentive throughout our meal.  The Fried Green Tomatoes came in a congealed red pepper sauce that was a pass, but the tomatoes themselves were sweet and tasty.  The beef ribs were incredibly fatty and charred with very little sauce.  The kids demolished the pizza and mac so those were the True winners of the meal.  Overall, I'm not sure I ordered the best tasting items on the menu so I'm going to chalk this up to me missing out on a potentially good meal.",

We both exchanged a  bit of witty banter and small talk with the server and the bartender. Super friendly, and great service.  We started with some beer samples. The lucielle ipa was nice, bitter, and sour. The hefeweizen had a nice aroma as well as a sour note at the end of the sip. My favorite, though, was the red ale: lightly sweet at the front and hoppy at the back with a nice mouthfeel. It went great with my meat orders. My dad and I shared a total of 6 meats. The pulled pork was tender, but had just a bit too much bite. The rib tips had a nice flavor and texture. The chicken was juicy and sweet. The baby back ribs were tender and sweet, though I wish it fell off the bone a bit more. The big beef rib was great: soft, crunchy outside, soft inside. The tri-tip was so tender, I didn't even need to cut it. The biscuit and the apple butter was sweet and salty like a caramel. The slaw, while a bit heavy, but cleaned my palate nicely with the beer. The slaw was also sweet, tangy, and light. Not to mention, all of this came out in a timely manner... it was like we looked away, and our food came.  Honestly came in because I needed more protein and fat macros. Left super satisfied. Will eat again.",

For an appetizer we had fried crispy spicy pickles. They were delicious and had a kick to them.  My friend ordered gumbo,  which came in a huge bowl with rice.  She said It was good.  The rue was darker than most gumbo I've had. I had the bbq chicken with burnt ends, rib tips, Mac n cheese,  and fries. I had both pieces of chicken quarter, it was more like I had half a chicken. I could've split the meal with the big portions I received. The Mac n cheese was okay. The drinks are served in big mason jars,  which gives you that country feeling. You can also take your drink to go in a large cup. The bill came to $50 for the two of us which wasn't bad at all I was expecting more. The staff is friendly and professional.  I'll be back try other food and drinks on the menu.",

For food - we ordered the brisket sliders, rib tips, and baked artichoke appetizers.   The brisket sliders had too much sauce on them, and it was a bit spicy. Could not taste the brisket. Not recommended. 3/10  Rib tips were meaty and good. Again, too much sauce to cover up the flavor of the actual smoky goodness of the ribs. 5/10  Baked artichoke was overcooked, and also covered with so much garlic that it didn't quite taste good. I love artichokes, but this one neither of us finished a half. 2/10.  Overall, the restaurant is nice, our bartender/server was nice...but the food just lacks that great BBQ flavor. There isn't a great BBQ place in Vegas, and Lucille's just falls in with the other mediocre places.",

    "text": "This is a great restaurant that offers a variety of my scrumptious BBQ favorites! The portions are fair for the price. The sides (e.g., baked beans, corn bread) are delicious. The warm biscuits with sweet apple butter spread is divine. My favorite meal is the baby back ribs. The meat literally falls of the bone. They have many in-house drink creations and specials. I love the design of the restaurant with an entrance from inside or outside of the casino.   I have to admit though, I know when to patronize this restaurant. If you don't, you might not have the same feelings about the atmosphere or menu as I. It only took a couple visits to figure out that the restaurant cannot handle large groups or an overly busy night without falling apart at the seams. The food quality goes down. The service goes down. The hostesses stop smiling. You become a number.   I hear some patrons say - \"I pay no mind to service - just the food.\" But, you really do and apparently don't give service credit for your overall experience. When you can't get a refill on your drink, your biscuits are cold and hard, your ribs are cold and chewy, and you go to pay your check at the end - service did matter. Service is intricately woven into everything part of a restaurant - or it becomes just another forgettable restaurant.   So, I love Lucille's - but, I visit them during non-peak times.   Last word for my older generation patrons that may want to visit Lucille's. They use your phone number at the hostess stand to text you when your table is being prepared & ready. I know... my grandfather said the same thing - \"What if I don't have a cell with text messaging?\" I think often times, business' forget about our older generation that may or may not be tech or text savvy. So, for those of you for whom this applies... you'll have to stick very close to the hostess station. They do not have a blinking rib notifier.",

Even worse when TWO tables that were seated after me get their food before me. Even worse when we ask the manager about our food and she says the ticket times are running 20 minutes and our ticket was only put in 15 minutes ago when we had been seated for 45 minutes already. Even worse when my friend asks for another beer while we wait since our waiter had not come over once to check on us and the manager rolls her eyes at him.  Even worse when our food finally arrives 55 minutes after we've been seated and they have given me the wrong sandwich and there is skin on top of my husband's grits from sitting so long.  It was really hard for me to not flip the table over at that point. I kept the wrong sandwich because I'd already waited close to an hour and was starving.  I will say that my wrong sandwich ended up being very tasty and they took it off the bill, but the experience with customer service was quite disastrous and I won't be visiting this establishment again.",

We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip (which is our favorite appetizer, we order it everywhere we go & this one is definitely in the top 2) I ordered the brisket meal that came with two sides. I chose the Mac & Cheese and mashed potatoes. They were delish. My boyfriend ordered the brisket sandwich & he was very VERY satisfied. Overall, the food was amazing. The customer service was pretty good as well. The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars is because it was really hot in the restaurant and they didn't have a bathroom. Also, my food took a good 45 minutes to come. But other than that my experience was very good.",

This place could be great, but there a couple of reasons why it doesn't hold four stars.    I don't normally pay mind to the service.  But it is very business like here.  From the hostesses to the managers, I never saw a smile.  The customer almost feels like he's intruding or being a bother.  The beef ribs were beautiful and plentiful, but really hard to eat.  Way too much sinew, marble, and who knows what else.  The sauce was sickening sweet.  And it was all just plain too greasy.  My teeth were throbbing and screaming for floss afterwards.  The rest of my party didn't like the ribs either.  The tritip was ok. It comes sliced and well done.    I think the prices are more like three $$$, so, for me to come back, there might have to be some live music on their little stage.",

The staff was all very welcoming and friendly. We had a great server named Kimberly she was very friendly and helpful.

Hopefully the service will improve as the staff gains more experience.  The highlight was the wedge salad - delicious with the crispy smoked bacon bits.  The Irish nachos (French fries with cheese) were tasty but got soggy as they cooled off.  The fried green tomatoes were good but the batter broke off of the tomatoes when cut.  The rib tips  and sausage were well prepared but in general I find Lucille's BBQ sauce too sweet for my taste. I also didn't really care for the biscuits with sugar on top.  Finally the happy hour drink choices: They have a good selection of Skky Vodka martinis but I found their happy hour beer selections limited primarily to their house brews.",

I told the hostess, she grabbed a rag, wiped some of the table off, then said she couldn't reach the rest of the table (where the mess was).  My husband took the rag and wiped the table.  When our food arrived, the waitress told my friend that she forgot to order the salad dressing that was requested for her salad and asked her what she wanted her to do!   My friend tasted her salad, said it was ok and we moved on.  After eating, we sat chatting for 10-15 min, then the waitress showed up and started clearing dirty dishes.   I requested the check, not knowing when she would return again.  With her hands full of dishes she made a SNARKY comment then RANTED BOUT HOW SHE'S  A BARTENDER NOT A WAITRESS AND THEY ARE SHORT STAFFED.  I do not eat this type of food so I can't rate it (I had a side salad and steamed vegetables.  NOT the vegetables that the waitress said would be served, but she's not a waitress, remember?)  The bottom line is that I will NOT return to a restaurant where the staff have attitudes/ issues/ are confrontational and where there are dirty tables.    This waitress is lucky my husband paid the bill because he ALWAYS tips well regardless of service; I would have chosen to have the tip reflect the attitude.",

We were in the area yesterday and had a $5 off coupon so thought what the heck.  BIG mistake.  Service and atmosphere were great but food was not good at all.   My favorite are the onion straws and I ordered them as a side to my steak sandwich.  The were beyond crispy...cremated comes to mind.  The steak sandwich was supposed to be served on artisan type bread but this was hogie roll like you'd get at Sams Club and seemed stale.  The steak was very thick...not good for a sandwich.  In the past at the District it was usually sliced and cut in 4 smaller size portions which were easier to eat.  Another favorite is the bbq chicken salad that my husband had...he lettuce was soggy and dressing tasted funny.  I spoke to our waiter about my food and he did take my sandwich off the check but we will not be back to the RR location.",

    "text": "Love the Lucille's in Henderson so we thought we would try the one at Red Rock because it was closer. Went on a sunday night and was seated promptly. The waitress took our orders but had to come back twice to see how I wanted my steak and what kind of potatoes I wanted. When the food came it was warm. Had the new york strip. Very taisty. They put a dollop of butter on the steak, but it isn't hot enough to melt it. We will go back and hopfully the wait staff is less forgettful.",

    "text": "Wonderful service.  However their signature tri tip sandwich was dry and closer to leather than beef.  The full rack of St. Louis ribs was a fairly meager portion for the price.  The shoestring fries were great. Eat in the bar.  It's much more relaxed and less of a circus.",

    "text": "This is the best South-Eastern style BBQ that I have tried so far.  I am more partial to Texas style, but this one is very good.  Had to ding them for a star because the BBQ sauce had a slight molasses taste to it (perhaps because it is South-Eastern style) and I thought it was slightly pricey (but it was in a casino).  The burnt tips are really not burned (that is a good thing) and are the best I have ever tried, including Texas style.",

I showed up after 20 minutes and the hostess acted as if she had no idea how to ring me up or ring up what I ordered. That part wasn't the problem but training your staff properly is always a good idea. My food was cold and the portions was extremely small for the $32 that I was charged. I live 2 minutes away from Red Rock casino and will drive to Famous Dave's next time.",

    "text": "The appetizers and sides are delicious! In terms of meat and sauce....I say Famous Dave's has them beat on the pulled pork, chicken and ribs. Coleslaw is fresh and yummy but I prefer the extra kick Famous Dave's slaw offers with the horseradish. The rib tips were great as long as there wasn't too much sauce on them. The deserts looked amazing but we were far too full to try. The biscuits beat corn bread any day! If you're at the Red Rock Lucielle's or The Yard House is the way to go for sure.",

I'm giving this review 4 stars strictly because of the service but not 5 because of the food. Our server, Alicia, was amazing. For being so young she was really attentive to not only us but the rest of her tables as well and she was very sweet. If we return to this location we'll definitely be requesting her!",
