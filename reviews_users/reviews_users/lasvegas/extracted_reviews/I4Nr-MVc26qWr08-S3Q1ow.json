    "text": "[FOOD]: Finding quality, cheap eats in Vegas was impossible to find until I stumbled upon Greenberg's Deli located in NY/NY's boulevard of restaurants. The deli is set-up like an assembly line so do not worry if the line looks long - it moves very quickly. Luckily, I came in at a non-peak time (~3PM) so I was in and out within 5 minutes. I ordered the Vinnie's Deluxe sandwich which was enough to fill me for lunch and dinner. It consisted of their famous pastrami, corned beef, and turkey. All the meats are sliced freshly for you when you order, and you have choice of bread (highly recommend their rye). The sandwich was extremely flavorful and competes well with any of the top delicatessens in New York. The sandwich only comes with mayo, so I recommend adding in some complimentary mustard to give it an extra kick.   [SERVICE]: Self-seating, traditional delicatessen-esque so no real service. Staff was friendly and gave me great recommendations on how to maximize the flavor of the meats!   [ATMOSPHERE]: Spacious deli with plenty of space for customers to slide trays down the assembly line. The restaurant really tried to replicate the feel of their other restaurants despite not having a True dining area (only a few tables located within the deli, but plenty of seating outside).  [TIPS]: COME HERE INSTEAD OF EARL OF SANDWICH. It's worth the extra $3 and you'll be 2x as full. Go between 2-4PM to avoid the line. If you're not that hungry, the sandwich will be too much for you, so split with a friend :)",

The Reuben's are out of this world....a similar Reuben (about 1/2 pound larger) at Carnegie Deli in New York is $24, this Reuben is $10. It's nearly as good. But it doesn't stop there....there brisket, turkey, all of the meats are very good. Pickles, mustards, the whole nine yards.   One additional not is that they now are open during breakfast hours, with the full menu available. Nice. They also have a $5.95 deal for either bacon, egg, cheese croissant or pastrami, egg bagel coupled with a large coffee. Very good deal and my croissant was Huge!   Really like this place....especially when you compare to areas nearby. $10 for an OK crepe, $6.00 for a so-so slice of pizza, etc.... Good food for good value.",

The guy carving the meat laughed and said he never had someone order that sandwich on a french roll before and he would never do that because that bread cannot hold all the meat. I let him know I wasn't a tourist and have eaten here several times before never ordering my sandwich on any other bread and never had a problem with it being messy. I then told him if he wanted to buy my $10 sandwich I would get it on the bread if his choice. He laughed and said to grab a fork and knife. For the record... No utensils were needed and no meat fell off my sandwich.   The sandwich had beef brisket, turkey, and pastrami with deli mustard and mayo. The meats on the sandwich taste well together and the bread was good. I always leave satisfied but do wish the sandwich was a little bigger. It also came with a pickle.

We ordered turkey sandwiches. After spending $80 on dinner we have to take all the sandwiches they sent over and throw them in the garbage. The turkey is the inedible processed type you find at cheap delis. This is supposed to be a real NY type deli, where people serve REAL TURKEY that is cut off a real turkey. This is processed junk that is salty and spongy and disgusting. I never bother to write reviews, but we are all hungry and disappointed that we have no dinner after waiting one and a half hours for this garbage. I would NEVER eat at this place. EVER.",

All that matters is the quality of food and service, and if you are getting the best bang for your buck, especially since your bucks don't go too far in Sin City.  We were staying at NYNY, and we wanted something filling, non-greasy, and quick. We were in the village, and found this spot, ordered the Italian Stallion and brought it up to our room. From the first bite, we were hooked. We ate it without saying a word to each other since it was so yummy. The meat was piled on, soft and so delicious. The bread is what made the sandwich so easy to eat. We didn't have to overstretch our mouths to get a bite. The textures were so perfect together. Bread so soft, meat so tender, we didn't even need a drink to wash it down. But hey in Vegas, the cocktails are in abundance anyway. Needless to say, we got sandwiches every day for the remainder of our trip.. I don't remember all the names but I know for sure we got the Big Vinnie and NY Skyhigh also, and we were not disappointed. The workers are a bit grouchy, but I would be too if I had a bunch of drunk shirtless bachelors telling me \"I'll have whatever you wanna give me.\" You wait in line, grab a tray, order and pay.. So service is minimal, but hey, saves you some tip money for later anyway. We vowed to return on everyday of our next trip... And we always catch ourselves back in SJ saying \"you know what sounds good right now?.... A sandwich from NYNY.\" Damn, can't wait for October.",

The set-up made me so frustrated I kind of lost my appetite....I did however get the pastrami. The prices have also gone up about $.50 from those shown in the pictures. PRICY for not a lot of food!",

Rather than the usual McDonalds, Haggen Daaz, Sbarro pizza fare  -the hotel has created the Village Eateries, a set of dining experiences set into a \" quaint city atmosphere\" modeled after the Greenwich village area of New York City. Across the \"street\" from Gonzalez Y Gonzalez is one of the jewels of the experience - the Greenberg Deli.  The deli provides an extensive menu of sandwiches which are served with a pickle wedge and chips or potato salad. The sandwiches are supurb. I have tried several, both hot and cold,  but the \"New York Sky High\" is a real treat. They pile on the roast beef, turkey, pastrami, cole slaw and the sandwich becomes a satisfying meal for the day. The more adventurous eater might want to try the \"Italian Stallion.\"  They have beer on draft to accompany the experience.  My choice is to get the sandwich and take it out to one of the tables set along the street - sit, enjoy and \"people watch.\"  A True Las Vegas experience",

On the last two trips, we ate at this place, which used to be our favorite \"go to\" spot for a quick sandwich. Last time, we realized something had changed. They no longer offered a pickle or potato salad with the sandwich (those are now $1.50 to add on) and the portions of meat on the sandwiches were cut in half. This time our bread was dry, there were four thin slices of pastrami folded over to appear like it was a fat sandwich, but when opened up, it was clear that the paper-thin meat was folded over and bulked up in the middle of the bread just disguising the fact that there was close to no filler, the meat only fit in the middle of the sandwich (so enough meat for 1/4 sandwich), which meant we paid $9 for a sandwich that was all dry bread and no meat. We also got a chicken salad sandwich. They used to serve 3/4 cup of chicken salad on a sandwich. Now they used an ice cream scoop so there was enough chicken salad for 1 slice of dry bread.  So disappointed in the change to this place. For $18, we got 4 slices of dry bread and hardly any sandwich filler. Never going back.",

In this Disneyland version of New York, they still managed to serve food with good flavor, and the potato salad and crisp pickle were the perfect accompaniment to the ice cold bitter beer.

Mayo was also wasted since you couldn't taste it.  Sandwich was filling and tasty.  Pickle was crisp and mildly spicy.  Service was very good...fast, friendly.  Overall a good value and good spot for lunch, snack or late night grub stop.

    "text": "So Jamie W. and I were in Vegas for a quick weekend getaway, and as usual, we were confronted with the dilemma of where to eat since we had no inclination to graze at one of the mammoth hotel buffets. We heard the competing chants of \"Hillary!\" and \"Bernie!\" once we entered the New York New York Casino since it was the morning of the Nevada Caucus. Surprisingly none of the supporters were flocking to any of the eateries in the area that's meant to evoke Greenwich Village right next to the slots. With nostalgic memories of Katz's Deli, we ambled our way into the faux-deli to see a condensed menu more akin to a California sandwich shop. In other words, this ain't Katz.  No thick slices of East Coast-style pastrami and corned beef to be found here. What I had was the $10.75 Corned Beef Sandwich on challah with lettuce, tomato and mayo (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Toew2b&s=bf74a5b1b650ed2cf73f65af7adda75a0a36924eb43af699b86eb526ffca427e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1Toew2b</a>). Yes, just call me Annie Hall. It was large enough but the meat slices were paper-thin, just not my preference when it comes to corned beef. It kept falling apart on me especially when the Hillary war chant came nearer. Symbolic? Perhaps. Jamie went for the $10.95 Greenberg's Reuben which was drippy with Russian dressing. All it elicited from Jamie was a pronounced shrug. I guess this was a case where we didn't need to be a part of it, New York, New York...  FOOD - 3 stars...just a middling sandwich despite the heft AMBIANCE - 3 stars...feels more like the Santa Cruz Boardwalk than Greenwich Village SERVICE - 2.5 stars...the most thoughtful person was the young cashier TOTAL - 3 stars...keep walking up the Strip, I say",

I walked inside at 10:03 PM and the gentleman at the counter politely explained that they were closed, when all of a sudden, some older lady with white hair and glasses rudely yelled at me across the restaurant saying the same (causing guests, who were eating their food at the booths, to be interrupted, turn around and look as well).  I replied back with \"I heard it!\" and hoped that would be the end of it, but it wasn't.  I turned to the man behind the counter and asked if he could recommend another outlet and while he was explaining it to me, the old woman came behind us and started yelling again, spoke to the gentleman in Spanish, and made me feel completely uncomfortable and unwelcome.  I really enjoy the food here and that's why I came, but this woman was completely out of line and treated me with tremendous disrespect.  I'll try and avoid this place from here on.",

It's in a casino so the prices are high, but the sandwiches are piled high with meat.  They are shy with cheese and condiments though! The egg creams are fantastic and so is the cheesecake. I used to come here just to eat before you had to pay for parking.  That's how worth it this deli is to me! I'd brave the strip as a local, go through the hassle of going to one of the big resorts and navigating a casino for a SANDWICH. I don't do that now because you have to pay for parking but took my opportunity to eat here because I was staying at NYNY for NYE.",

If you look at the photo I have attached, you'll see something thing that looks like three olives in the picture. Those are caper berries. Who ever served this junk and called it capers? And if you look at the tomato slices, you can see the tell tale sign of a tomato that was frozen and thawed. And lastly is the sludge on the lettuce from Nova that had been sitting on it for days. The lettuce is transparent from the Salmon oil it has absorbed. In addition the EggCream was disgusting. It is almost all seltzer with a splash of milk and a drop of chocolate syrup. No flavor even close to an EggCream.  It was foul and disgusting meal that I did not finish. Stay far away from Greenberg & Sons Delicatessen at the New York, New York Casino in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Greenberg's Deli brings back that loving feeling that's been gone gone gone. Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area I grew up with the loving feeling of dining in delis that serve delicacies from kasha varnishes to Ruben sandwiches. After moving to Las Vegas there has been far less New York delis to enjoy the these delicacies that I love. I am surprised that it took my brother and I over 15 years to try Greenberg's Deli. Better late than never.      It is appropriate that Greenberg's Deli sits inside New York - New York within a Disneyfied Greenwich Village. Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders.      When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is  the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change.     Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are.     The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries.      Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone.",

Grab a tray and get in line at one end, order, pick up your sandwich and pay at the other end where you exit the line. I decided to get a simple Reuben ($10.95) with pastrami on rye with the standard fixings of swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. Similar to what you can expect in deli's in NY the meat for the sandwich is sliced fresh right in front of you. Looking at this process I thought that I would be standing in line for a long time but the person behind the counter worked fast and kept the line moving at a steady pace.  The sandwich itself is not very big but could be considered to be a decent lunch sized portion. It has a decent amount of meat but its not like its piled sky high. What it has going for itself is the taste which is really good. Definitely among the best that I've had. The rye bread is toasted perfectly. The pastrami is of high quality and its taste is not eclipsed by the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing but shines through in each bite. It's price is also right considering that it is on the strip in a Casino. Overall I liked what I ate so would not have a problem stopping by the next time I'm in town.",

Greenberg's Deli inside of New York New York is the perfect place to get an extremely filling sandwich for a fairly reasonable price! People rave about Earl of Sandwich, but I found it to be nothing special aside from the low price. However, Greenberg's has some really quality meats that don't need a ton of dressing up before inserting between two slices of fresh bread. I ordered the Greenberg's Reuben on marbled rye, and it came with pastrami piled at least two inches thick, as well as a generous helping of sauerkraut. I love the combination of the savory meat and the sour cabbage, but after only half the sandwich I was struggling to down the other half! The size of the sandwich is insane, but they definitely don't skimp on quality at all. If you're looking for a quick meal to pad your stomach for whatever you're doing in Vegas, Greenberg's is definitely the place to go!",

Like most things in Vegas, I felt that it was slightly overpriced, but not ridiculous. I would definitely recommend getting a sandwich at Greenburg's when in Vegas!",

The pastrami was served barely warm (which was ok even though it should've been served hot), sliced thin, and was pretty tasty! It came with a decent whole pickle. I only ordered the potato salad because it was mentioned by other Yelpers to be good. I found it to be bland and tasteless and wouldn't order it again. The chocolate egg cream was delicious. You get a large sized drink cup for $2.95. If you're a New Yorker, it's hard to miss the glaring typo on one of their signs touting NYC authenticity. See if you can find it! The staff were all very pleasant and the restaurant was pretty clean for a busy Saturday night. It's not NYC's Katz or 2nd Avenue Deli, but will satisfy your pastrami craving while in Vegas.",

That is one thing that I feel makes a good sandwich. We had the sandwiches with a bag of chips, potato salad, a pickle and we shared a lemonade. The potato salad was ok. The lemonade was good, not too sweet.   Overall I liked this place and would come back. Next time I will get my own lemonade though-no sharing.

After walking around I wasn't in the mood to sit and be waited on in a restaurant, I didn't want greasy old flat pizza nor a hot dog located next door.   After reading the menu on the wall this place sounded like it would do. I ordered the turkey toasted on wheat slice bread with cheese and all the standard samage produce, w/o mayo. The order taker told the sandwich maker the order. I watched as he was assembling the sandwich and saw him put a huge heeping blob of mayo on the bread. I went back and told the order taker that I asked for no mayo. He turned around and told the guy making the sandwich. The guy making the sandwich got a little of an attitude with the order taker, threw the sandwich away and started a new one. I feel bad to see food wasted.   After a few minutes the sandwich went through the toaster and was dressed with the produce, wrapped up and given to me. I took our sandwiches and drinks to the other counter to pay.   Price was close to $27. For two sandwiches and two teas. $9.25 each sandwich and $2.95 per each bottle of tea. Way over price for a small sandwich with no side.   Sorry no pics on this one I was so hungry I forgot to pull the camera out before devouring it. In the end it was good and hit the spot but over priced.",

Line moves quickly and there was plenty of seating available. Imagine this place could be packed at the 1am-3am munchies hours.   Really pigged out with a Vinnie's Deluxe, chips, matzo ball soup and a soda!! - It turned out to be my only real meal of the day. The sandwich was flavorful and stuffed to the max with pastrami, brisket and turkey. Freshly sliced as you watched them assemble the piles of meat. Will pass on the soup next time, not much to rave about there - maybe do the potato salad next time instead. Prices have increased over the years so a sandwich was more than $10 but still a great value for the sandwich. The only negative price wise was $3.50 for a bottled soda - not sure how I missed seeing that!  I had given Earl of Sandwich a decent review from an earlier visit that week, but don't see going back there after having been to Greenberg's Deli for a few extra bucks and way better sandwich.",

I also suggest more training on the deli equipment before someone is in need of stitches from the slicing wheel. The girl making my sandwich was having a hard time as a result of the previously mentioned hard portion and nearly pushed her finger into the wheel before deciding to shut it off while she fussed over the meat.   I like to watch someone fussing over meat as much as the next guy but no one should lose a finger.  The potato salad was very bland.  Rather than leaving me with a fond memory of deli's I have been to in NYC, Boston, Cleveland, etc it left me wishing I had skipped it and wanting the real deal even more.",

    "text": "NYNY's food court is modelled after Greenwich Village and is a breath of fresh air on the strip after experiencing the over-the-top excesses found in The Venetian, Caesar's Palace and Bellagio. Right in the middle of the \"Village Eateries\" you can find Greenberg's Deli. We walked in and encountered no line on a Friday afternoon in February. The help behind the counter was friendly and helpful and the sandwiches didn't take very long to prepare.  I couldn't resist the temptation to sample their foot long hot dog ($3.95) which came with potato salad. I also ordered a cup of Matzah ball soup ($3.50). My lovely wife opted for the Reuben sandwich (a whopping $9.50). A bottle of water ($2.50) and two draft Peronis ($5.25 apiece) rounded out the order. We sat \"outside\" on the sidewalk and dug in. The Reuben was monstrous with corned beef and sauerkraut spilling out beyond the edges of the insufficiently large slices of rye. I glanced down at the 12\" of wiener and large warm balls on my plate and was momentarily jealous of this impressive package.  Ref: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=lqw28h3QHm0LbOMuhv7lMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr...</a>  I idly wondered how their \"Italian Stallion\" sandwich measured up. The jealousy didn't last for long. The Matzah ball soup lacked the \"schmaltzy\" flavor I was expecting and the dog was merely a very long but otherwise average dog. The Reuben was a bit better and possessed the girth the dog lacked. I did like their potato salad. The Peroni (served in an under-sized plastic cup) was cold and crisp and altogether unremarkable.  Without considering the price tag, this was quite a pleasant (although completely forgettable) three-star experience. However, the bill came to $32.27 and with it came raised expectations. The NYNY website states that the average check comes to $8-9 per person. Obviously, this is a figure that doesn't include alcohol. Give me a break! What small minority of Vegas tourists aren't having a beer with their deli sandwich!",

I should have gotten something else, but this was amazing.    The place is filled with different artwork around the menu inside.  There is no free WiFi or bathrooms inside. The interior is very small and has three booth seats/tables inside. But, there are many hard table tops and chairs outside. The outside is noisy due to the casino and people socializing, but it gives you a lively feeling once you look around.    The prices are moderate with about 10-20$ range of a variety of different sandwiches. I personally like the New York sky high, the Italian stallion and one with a beef brisket. (Forgot the name)    Overall, my experience here is and always will be amazing. There is also a black and white cookie that my family craves and we get it every time. I personally think it is not bad.",

The last three times here, we've noticed their pastrami isn't quite as lean, but more importantly, the rye bread was very dry and a bit stale.  The first two times we just let it go and decided we caught them on a bad day.  Today I experienced the same problem!  DRY, STALE RYE BREAD!  At 11:45 am no less.....just at the start of busy lunch time!  I VERY politely informed the manager that it was a bit disappointing as I was leaving and told her we had to throw away 3/4 of our sandwiches.  We did NOT ask for nor expect refunds.  We merely wanted her to be informed for future reference that this had happened to us more than once.  She called me a liar.  Wow.  We left.  We won't be returning.  Terrible way to treat a paying customer who merely offered constructive criticism and feedback.",

Marble Rye, perfect Corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss  She loved it. l had the Twin meats (juicy, tender Pastrami & Corned Beef) topped it with Swiss cheese and Cole slaw on Rye. Both came with great dill pickles. Definitely tell them to slather your sandwich with the spicy deli mustard. My only minor complaint was that their tasty Rye bread barely held up to the contents of my sandwich.  Next time I'll ask them to slightly toast up the rye bread.  Otherwise it was a great lunch stop. Service was fast and friendly. Price was good for the quality and amount of meat you get.",

    "text": "Went here awhile back to sample a NY style deli, as I've never been to the east coast and am very interested in their food. After pouring over Yelp reviews we decided on Greenberg's instead of some of the other ones. Since working on the strip I've had a chance to sample sandwiches from many, many, of the delis in major hotels out there and have mostly been disappointed. Way too expensive for not that much.. Not So at Greenberg's, Holy Cow! Two of us ordered one (1) sandwich for $10. We decided on a Rueben with corn beef and pastrami and rye bread. It was as big as my head and tasted delicious. We split the sandwich in half and were extremely full afterwards. We barely finished all the meat. Like some other reviewers said don't come here unless you are extremely hungry or looking to share. Absolutely worth it, we will definitely be coming back and trying more of the menu, and if that's the way they eat in NY I'm OMW!!",

Each of the four of us were very pleased with our meals, and we seriously considered coming back for additional meals later in the trip.    I got a sandwich that had brisket, turkey, pastrami topped with muenster cheese on rye that was very good.  Another person in our group got the same thing and agreed.  I think the sandwich was around $9, which was a good value.  An added bonus was that we sat outside the restaurant and were able to watch the NCAA games that were going on from the tv's at whatever bar is across the way.",

I'll start with the good...I liked eating outside the deli in the fake Greenwich Village. Major props to the designer. So the BF ordered the pastrami reuben and when I took a bite, I immediately regretted not getting that instead. The gooey swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and pastrami was pure goodness sandwiched between two pieces of toasty marble rye bread. Why, why, why did I order a regular pastrami sandwich?! Without the swiss cheese and sauerkraut, the sandwich was pretty dry (even with mustard) and not nearly as big as it looks in pictures. Next time, I'm going for the reuben or beef and cheddar melt!",

I salted. I mustard it up, to no avail. Where was that peppery taste?There was also a fatty taste that lingered all up in my mouth. I checked the meat and there was the normal amount of fat to it. I couldn't figured it out. What happened to all the hype about this deli? Maybe it was a just a funky slab that day.

Made to look like a traditional NYC-style deli, Greenberg's does not disappoint with its selection of traditional offering, served in generous portions, and most for only about $9.  I got a hot corned beef on rye with spice brown mustard, two pickles, and potato salad.  I'm usually content paying $12-16 for that since that is what it usually costs.  But here my total (incl tax) was $8.59.  The sandwich was delicious, very satisfying.  Definitely worth stopping by for a good, cheap lunch.",

Sure, it's kitchy, situated in a movie-studio-esque set made out to look like a Greenwich Village corner, in the New York \"borough neighborhood\" abutting the New York New York main casino floor. We sat in a \"courtyard\" adjacent to the deli, complete with NY scenes on murals and illuminated trees. It was totally fake and we knew it (what, no screeching tires? No graffiti? No hobos? No wafting smells of food vendors on the streets intermingled with urine? C'mon, this ain't legit New York!). But still, but still.... you can imagine being there. And that was good.  And the food! The food was legit!!!! We had a pastrami sandwich which was as good as any found in the Big Apple. I kid you not. With your choice of breads, and a big pickle and the best mustard to boot, the meat was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. And with the typical generous portion, too. We were so impressed. And stuffed.

The meat was very good and on par as far as quality with Carnegie.  On the strip, these are the only two comparable New York delis that I have found.  Greenberg's would be my recommendation for quality, while Carnegie's portions are unmatched.    Still, Greenberg's is not too expensive considering its location.

Croissant was flaky and delicious.   Sandwiches for lunch and dinner are also a winner. Enjoyed my turkey club triple decker. On Another trip, I chose the tuna salad in eye and was not disappointed.

    "text": "Greenberg's Deli is a spot you should definitely hit while in Vegas specially after drinking nothing sounded better than big fat Pastrami Sandwich. :-)  Located in New York, New York, Greenberg's is tucked in among the \"city streets\". You order at the counter, the meat is all sliced to order, thin and delicious. The sandwiches are huge.  Hot and fresh made meats including pastrami, corned beef and turkey, made to order on a selection of freshly baked breads, with house made mustard and dill pickle on the side.   I had the pastrami sandwich and potato salad. Fresh ingredients, the bread tastes amazing, and the pastrami so delicious and piled so high that it's hard to figure out how to eat it! So yummy, and the potato salad is perfect with the sandwich.  For a quick and relatively inexpensive meal, definitely stop by this place and grab a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This is a nice little find inside New York New York, primarily led by my friend who had a special connection with the name of the restaurant, as it was his grandmother's name as well. Fortunately, based on the blissful looks as he and I ate the matzo ball soup and chicken noodle soup, it became apparent that this meal was one that even she'd approve of. I've always been a fan of pastrami, and we shared a fairly large New Yorker special sandwich with pastrami, corned beef and cole slaw. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw, but I really fell in love with the hot, greasy and succulent mattress of meats, sandwiched by warm and savory rye bread. The star of the show, of course, was still the matzo ball soup, as the giant ball literally melted in your mouth, soaked to the brim with the broth. The overall ambiance is cool, kinda cheesy with NY decors, but I dug the expired meters placed outside each of the 'outdoor' tables. For prices, yeah, this place was expensive, but for Vegas standard, it was acceptable. The water is $3...but I managed to convince the kind staff to bring me some tap water, so kudos!  Food; 4 stars Price: 2-3 stars Ambiance: 4 stars Service: 3 stars",

We tried the Caesar salad and the tomato Italian salad. Both tasted extremely good with very fresh ingredients. The sandwich can be quite big and heavy, so I highly recommend people to split and share the sandwich with a salad. That would be the perfect blend of greens and sandwich.

The Parmesan is the desiccated kind from a shaker, and the amount was very small. The Caesar dressing is from a packet. Honestly, this is the saddest effort I've ever seen for a salad. I've had more interesting salads from turnpike gas stations.  The only redeeming quality here is that the lettuce was very crisp and not wilted.

The second was the Greenberg's Ruben, which had just as filling and had the right balance of sauerkraut, cheese, and pastrami on delicious fresh rye bread.

The premise is really cute: the food court in the New York, New York hotel is supposed to resemble an old NY neighborhood, featuring pizza and a deli. However, walk into the deli to find that there isn't that much variety in their foods and the food is incredibly average. Very little seating inside of the deli, but there are many (I repeat, many) tables outside on the \"street\" area, so don't fret.  My sister and I both ordered the tuna salad, hers on wheat and mine on ciabatta. The tuna itself was quite tasty; however, the untoasted bread kind of detracted from the flavor. Both sandwiches were served with a deli-style pickle, which was a great touch. My sister also ordered the matzo ball soup, which was pretty OK.   All in all, probably not worth the price. I wish that I had gotten a hot dog from the stand across the \"street\" from the deli, but that's for the next time we come ;)",

The pastrami and egg bagel was lacking pastrami and basically was dry as the desert landscape. What the hell would I put on it anyway? ketchup or mustard? Bad choice. The specials came with coffee or tea, but the coffee was below par and they just give you hot water and a teabag. The veggie breakfast burrito was slightly better, but was lacking flavor and was unimpressive for a Vegas breakfast. Skip breakfast and get a sandwich - it's too late for me, but your still there reading this review.",

Since there's a 'wichcraft in San Francisco (and the ratings weren't that good for the Vegas location), we ended up at Greenberg's.   Service: - the first thing you'll notice here is how EFFING SLOW they are!!!!! Bring a book or two, you might be able to finish one while you're waiting! - two of the older ladies that work here could be replaced with someone more competent - the scooper sits in the sink until they grab it to put ice in your cup. Just seems a bit dirty to me - not all the service is bad tho, the guys that take your order and make the sandwiches were pretty cool   Food: - Beef Brisket on Wheat - VERY good! a lot better than Katz's in NY. Slices were thinner than usual and meat was really tender and easy to bite  through - Beef and Cheddar Melt - VERY good! This thing was huge! I was full after eating 1/2 of this - Potato Salad - good. nothing too special tho - Chips - just a tiny bag of Lay's, but they have other chips you can buy if you want - Chicken Noodle Soup - good. like the potato salad, it's nothing too special. Like a can of chicken noodle soup, but fresh and hopefully better quality ingredients - Pickles - good. the last NY deli I ate at is Katz's, and they give you two different types of pickles. I didn't like either one of 'em, but this was pretty good  Misc: - There's a good amount of tables in the designated dining area next door, but there are also a few tables just outside that are pretty cool w/ parking meters and fire hydrants close by some of them.",

(hence the 4 stars, but it really should be 4.5)  Also, I recommend getting the potato salad versus chips because they give you the single serve Lay's Potato Chip bags and that's just full of more salt, just saying.  So, happy eatings everyone!!",

I ordered a fruit salad and a smoked salmon platter.  The fruit salad had to be exchanged for another one because the strawberry was a little rotten.  That should have been my first sign.  The smoked salmon platter came with 6 or 7 pieces of smoked salmon sitting on top of shredded lettuce and 5 slices of tomatoes on the side.  There was water between the smoked salmon and the lettuce, plus the fact that it looked like it was sitting in the container for a long time.  I thought at the time, oh it's OK, the water is just from the lettuce.   I ate everything and had really bad food poisoning.  Luckily it was the 2nd last day of the trip so I had my fun already.  I spent 1 whole day in bed  On a side note, I tried the chicken noodle soup that my friend ordered and wished I had ordered that instead.  The soup was full of vegetables, noodles and chicken.  It wasn't too salty and tasted home made.  In the end, I won't be able to eat here again.",

A lot of people are going to judge me with the notion of, \"Oh come on, come off of it, it's just a sandwich joint in New York New York\". Its more than that. Having gotten a sandwich here last year after indulging in more than a few adult beverages, I thought my perception was skewed. This time around, I was completely sober when enjoying my sandwich.   And enjoy my sandwich I did. I had the trio of salami. My sister had the chicken, and I feel like my mom had some sort of chicken salad. I tried them all. And wanted to eat them all. Normally, my sister can out-eat me. Not that night. I ate  my sandwich and half of hers. Shame. Or luck. You decide.   Seriously. This place is a random, hidden gem. It's not  a real Jewish deli, but that doesn't concern me. What concerns me is the fresh bread and good deal for the price. A solid sized and delicious sandwich with a side and a soda for under $10 in vegas? You'll spend more than that on a beer in vegas.",

They gave us a choice of bread: focaccia, ciabatta, sourdough, marbled rye and there was probably a wheat choice in there, or croissant. The prices here were great ($8 a sandwich) and they're big enough to split. Good place to stop for a quick bite before wandering back onto the Strip.",

    "text": "OMG!  Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had.  If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino.  My friends are thoughtful.  On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race.  My race morning ritual is pretty simple.  One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead.  Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping.  Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning.  They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade.  The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away.  With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides.  Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr...</a>).  I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight.  The sandwich was incredible.  The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City.  It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's.  The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it.  The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill.  It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning.  Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning.  Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make.  I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another.  This time I had the New York Skyhigh (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr...</a>) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice.  I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top.  Here it was without the froth (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr...</a>) as I had already sucked it up.  I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink?  Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz!  Greenberg's is very reasonably priced too as their sandwiches are mostly under $10 including the sides!",

Thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, this was the ONLY place I could find that had chicken noodle soup (or any soup for that matter) and it was within walking distance (it was right across the street from our hotel).  Thank you Greenberg's Deli for serving PIPING HOT CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP!! It was so good that it burned my tongue. And it was only $4.00 so I bought two, although I probably would've paid $100 since I was sick and desperate for soup!! Needless to say, it made us better and the next morning, we were up and walking around!!!  Thank you Greenberg's deli, will definitely be back for your delicious HOT cheap soup, even when I'm not sick!!!",

Probably would have skipped the fruit plate, just your standard mix of honeydew, watermelon and cantaloupe - slightly waterlogged, guessing that it must've been sitting in the fridge for 2+ days.  Overall, Greenberg's offers good food at great value and quick service. Way better than other delis, fast food joints and hotel cafes on the strip.

Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip.",

If you are looking for grab and go style, very laid back, this is your place! There is seat yourself tables located right outside the deli and it looks similar to park benches in NYC.   Food:  I just dropped in for the Ruben, and it was really good. Fresh cut, with cheese and slid under the conveyor oven to melt perfectly. The bread soaked up the Italian dressing nicely and it wasn't overly greasy.  It was PACKED with meat. I would say one sandwich is worth sharing unless you are starving, or want to take half home for later.  The Pickle's were also amazing. Ask for two and they are happy to oblige.     Critiques: If I had any critiques it would be that there really isn't an orderly line, so the service is slow. Luckily there weren't too many people when I stopped in, but once I had my food it was crowded and getting backed up. Also, the soft drink selection wasn't great. But they did have a large selection of kettle chips. Worth a shot!",

We attended a concert at the T-Mobile Arena, which in itself was not a big hit for us; but this deli made up for an otherwise frustrating night. After finally being dropped off for the show we ventured into this NY/NY indoor food court. The crew began debating where to eat, with the variety that met our eyes. I stayed quiet and when asked where I wanted to eat I pointed to the closest restaurant near us - Greenberg's Deli. Issue resolved...  We are all very glad we did! We ordered the Beef & Cheddar Melt and the Italian Stallion. I watched my Beef & Cheddar Melt being made and was drooling when they pulled out a huge beef brisket and started slicing! After placing the sandwich orders we walked over to where you order drinks. $5 draft beers!!! Where in Lost Wages can you find that?! Not at the nearby T-Mobile Arena that's for sure! Oh, and the price of the sandwiches we ordered? $12.95 and $10.95 respectively. Not a bad price for being on the strip, let alone within/attached to a mega-casino.   The sandwiches (both toasted) came out LOADED with meat! We were all very impressed, to say the least. They take care of their customers here! The combo of grilled onions and mushrooms were layered just enough to taste them both, but not overpower the excellent flavor of the beef brisket (Beef & Cheddar Melt).     I told the family that I would definitely like to eat here again, but not when there is some activity happening at the adjacent arena (what a cluster the ingress / egress is when that is happening). By far our best deli sandwich restaurant we have experienced in this over-populated tourist city!",

There are many more unique options.   We needed a quick dinner after watching Zumanity and this place was dead. The system they have is a little unclear. You order from the far right and then stand at an unmarked area in the middle to pick up your sandwich. Then if you want a drink or a soup, you go to the far left, but this is labeled. You pick up straws, utensils, etc., and then get in the check out line.   We both enjoyed our sandwiches. They were filling, they tasted fresh, nothing was too soggy or too crunchy. I enjoyed my Italian Stallion and my boyfriend had only good things to say about the reuben. We only rate this 4 though, since there isn't anything wildly special about this place and the process was a tad imperfect (but not terrible).",

I'm not a huge fan of New York New York hotel/casino but the teenagers wanted to walk around so we split up and my husband an I went wandering around. I was hungry BUT we had dinner reservations later on and I didn't want to spoil my appetite.   I just wanted something quick, not huge or anything. My husband pointed out this place and I said sure because I do love sandwiches! We ordered the ham and Colby Jack sandwich and honestly it was delicious. We actually only ordered one and it was big enough for the both of us. It honestly really tasted good.I believe they shave the meat right there and everything tasted fresh, the bread was really good and I was genuinely pleasantly surprised.  This is not a restaurant type of place but there are tables that you can sit at and it's totally casual.   I will definitely be going back there again on my next trip out to Vegas!",

I was staying at the Excalibur last week and decided to grab a bite at NY NY and found Greenbergs, right behind the times square bar. It didn't have a huge line so we decided to get two NY sky rises a lemonade and potato salad. Fantastic!!!!! The bread was nicely toasted, the meats were so fresh and hot, the coleslaw was mild but gave a great crunch, and the thousand island brought the whole sandwich together. Potato salad was prepackaged but still good. Lemonade, no so much.   Only one complaint, the ordering system is a bit confused, especially if there are multiple people waiting for the samething. I would use a ticket system, personally. Workers are rather....charmless.   Loads of places to sit around. We paid about 10 for each sky rise, 1.75$ for the potato salad (that's right), and about 3 for the lemonade. So decent prices for something this good. This is a great place to have a decent lunch and will carry you to dinner or beyond.   Definitely worth the stop.",

I can only assume that most have never eaten outstanding Jewish deli food, and, as often happens with reviews on Yelp, a lack of reference points leads to a misevaluation.  People need to understand what Greenberg's is. It's essentially a fast food version of an authentic Jewish deli--a replica that has the basic look and feel of an authentic deli, but not the food quality or soul. This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.  Folks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like. They know what real matzo ball soup tastes like, and what the best pastrami tastes like.   Greenberg's is a 2-star deli at best, and, quite honestly, is just a fast food version of a Jewish deli. It kills me to know that people leave Greenberg's believing they've just eaten quality Jewish deli food. Oy vey!",

This time I got the end of the meat they were cutting which was filled with fat that I was not to trilled with but 1 out of 12 isn't bad. The meat here is very tasty though and the potato salad is also very good. I hate comparing one place to another but I guess eating at Katz deli in NY will do that to you when trying other places that import their meat from The Big apple. I would recommend this place to any of my friends and or family if in Vegas and looking for a New York style sandwich. I'm not super huge on the California style pastrami which is normally super greasy and stuffed into a sub which isn't my type of pastrami sandwich so if you like a east coat deli style sandwich this is the place for you.",

    "text": "So, it's \"new\" Vegas and things aren't as cheap as they used to be. No $5.00 sandwiches or the like. Having a sandwich here will not set you back as much as a certain New York Deli in a sister MGM property. During this four day stay where it was too hot to even go outside, I went to Greenberg's twice. First time I had the Pastrami on Rye, yes \"spicy\" mustard, please. Hey I'm a native New Yorker and \"spicy\" to me means Gulden's and always will. I'll have to say the Pastrami wasn't the most flavorful I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty awesome, but, as I said, I'm a native New Yorker, born and bred and have probably eaten at more Delis than most Jews in Brooklyn where I was born. I must say that while not the most flavorful, it was without a doubt, the most tender Pastrami I've ever eaten. I don't often use the term \"melts in your mouth\" outside of M&Ms, but this was like eating something with the consistency of \"meat butter.\" I washed it down with something liquid... yeah, whatever. Second visit I had to go the other route for this cut of meat and have the Corned Beef. The fact that the \"sandwich making lady\" didn't even have time to take the Beef off the slicer to put it back in the steam cabinet is a testament to how popular it is. While just as tender as the Pastrami, this Corned Beef is some of the best I've ever had since I left New York City. I had this sandwich on Marbled Rye and it wasn't remarkable, I would stick with plain Rye like I had with the Pastrami. Grab a few extra packets of Gulden's as you slide around to the cashier, you'll want more mustard. Even if you aren't staying at New York New York, do yourself a favor and go have a moderately priced Deli Sandwich at this Deli before you blow your $$$ at the place down at the Mirage. This is one of the places that I'll probably never try anything else since I don't ever want to risk having a bad experience, so, I'll stick to the tried and True.",

WOW. this deli is the real deal. Ordered the twin bill. Ordered corned beef and pastrami.  I have had good pastrami in some Deli's and good corned beef in others   This establishment has perfect pastrami and perfect corned beef.   Big sandwich. Not gargantuas like some others but perfect size.  $13.95. What a great price. These meats are costly and they serve a generous portion.  Do not pass this by if you want a traditional excellent deli sandwich",

I chose the classic turkey club as it looked great on the pictures of other yelpers. I received it quickly and paid $11.91 tax included. I sat down at one of the tables, they can use a cleanup. The sandwich is large but I honestly don't like the bread at all: it is soft and dry, not like a French baguette as you'd expect it. I ate half of it and took the rest home to make it crispy on my panini grill. Overall satisfied with what I got. I didn't buy any beverages as the prices for those are outrageous (over $3 for a water!).",

The sandwiches aren't particularly large from a comparative standpoint and the pastrami was kind of stringy. I guess it was cheaper than Goldberg's but for a few bucks more I could have something twice as large. The service was OK but if you can't throw me an extra pickle without charging me then why would I bother. This is the Subway of NY Jewish Deli's.",

I spotted them making a tray of fresh pico and asked for a side-we added it to the sandwich and I would recommend it this way! The croissant was flaky and toasty and for a sandwich and a tea for less than $7 it was TOTALLY worth the stop! Its inside the NY NY hotel ;)",

The staff was very helpful when I asked for recommendations and they were quick to make or sandwiches.  The flavor reminds me of sandwiches I ate in Boston and NY, with the difference being you get to choose your bread here.  The price is cheaper than expected, considering it's in a casino, and the portions are great.  Overall, one of the best sandwich joints in Las Vegas.",

While breakfast is available until 11:00 AM, the sandwiches are the king of this deli.  On my latest excursion, I ordered the New York Skyhigh, with corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing with your choice of bread (my favorite is the marbled rye).  While the name says sky high, the sandwich isn't overbearingly large.  In fact, it's the perfect size to finish while sitting in the casino floor watching the drove of visitors walk by.    My only knock on this place is that it's not open 24 hours.  If you want your Jewish deli fix, you'll need to come in before 10:00 PM.  Otherwise, this is a great place to grab a quick (and for Vegas, inexpensive) bite to eat.",

Whether you're splurging on the finest or scouting for the cheapest buffets via hotel coupons, you really won't be able to get the \"full experience\" without trying multiple places - even simultaneously.  During a recent trip to Vegas with my girlfriend, we made sure to eat at as many eateries as possible. On our first day, we checked out Greenberg's Deli since we wanted something on top of our amazing \"snack\" at Secret Pizza (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyelp.to%2FqTKq%2FhVVossacaQ&s=c4b48d94df9fa209a8a073a594905e701d55570434823ccf4369835a5bfe59d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yelp.to/qTKq/hVVossacaQ</a>). Greenberg's was located on the first floor of the New York, New York hotel so it really wasn't far for us to walk to albeit under hot summer heat.   Coming into Greenberg's we really enjoyed the nice, quiet ambiance. Even though we were surrounded by the raucous of the casino, this deli offered a tranquil shelter for us. The beautiful decor, nice wallpaper, and relaxing setting - they all helped paint a peaceful ambiance that reminded me of sitting inside Central Park.  In terms of menu options, Greenberg's served a variety of hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads, and even appetizers. This place was definitely geared towards meat lovers, as most items were PACKED with protein ingredients. Cost was fairly average, but decent for Sin City standards. Like most sandwiches were around $11-$13 each.  My girlfriend and I ended up splitting their Mesquite Chicken Sandwich. It kinda took a while for our sandwich to be made, but I did appreciate that they took their time and made sure every ingredient we wanted was included.   Overall, the sandwich wasn't bad. Though kinda dry, it had a gigantic helping of juicy chicken, lots of ham, fresh veggies, and a massive pickle for my girl! Bread was okay too. It definitely wasn't anything special, and I struggled to finish my half without chugging water, but this for sure provided enough sustenance until dinner. Damn, it needed more sauce even though the sandwich supposedly had bacon ranch!  If you're wandering around New York, New York and don't want anything too unhealthy, I may suggest Greenberg's Deli. I didn't find this place to be utterly amazing, but it was sufficient. I give it a \"Tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating.  Eat well and prosper",

I would have liked a bit more thousand island on my pastrami and corned beef but it was well crafted and you watch them slice the meat fresh from roast out of the steam drawer.

    "text": "The seating area outside of Greenberg's Deli was packed on my last visit, so I asked for my food to-go. Depending on the time and day, inside can get crazy busy and I'm used to that, so it doesn't bother me if I end up getting my order to-go or not. The line can get long, but it  moves fairly quick.   There are 3 different sandwiches on the menu I like, so I am glad that they have kept them over the years. Problem is the prices and consistency of the food has changed. I used to pay $8.95 for a sandwich that currently costs $12.95 and isn't as big as it was before. That or the amount of meats are off. For example when I get a sandwich that has 3 different types of meat on it, they put a thin layer of pastrami on the bottom and then a huge amount of turkey. I post pictures each visit and you can clearly see how they are not consistent with amount of meat they put on each sandwich. When I told the guy working this last visit what type of sandwich I wanted on a French roll, he said that he wouldn't recommend that type of bread with that sandwich. I explained that I had ordered it many times before on that type of bread and would prefer it please. He made it the way I ordered it and the sandwich came out tasting great! The meat had good flavor and it was tender and juicy and it's still carved in front of you. I still give 4 stars even with the meat portions being off because the meat here is excellent. I only wish that if they are going to raise the prices, that they not put less meat on the sandwiches as well coleslaw or at least when they do pile the sandwiches high they should put equal amounts of each meat. They do still have soup and for beverages hey have water, juice, beer and soda.",

I don't think I have any \"I would fly there just to eat this specific restaurant\" spots, but Greenberg's is about as high on the non-existent list as it gets.  I've never eaten at a real New York deli, but that is on the bucket list for this year for sure. What I've always imagined in my head as an authentic NY sandwich, Greenbergs hits on the head and makes me long even deeper for an authentic experience. The meat is stacked high on two ultra fresh pieces of bread. Their pastrami tastes better than any pastrami that I've ever tasted, the roast beef?? So moist and delicate and I should know--roast beef is my favorite type of sandwich meat. I'm half convinced that these sandwiches are made with a sprinkle of love.  The price is right for a sandwich this massive from anywhere, let alone Vegas. I could almost justify the plane ride out there for a sandwich so cheap. Well, not quite, but one can dream!  I was able to squeeze it in twice this last trip and two times on the trip before. Of everything I've had, I think the reuben is still my fave but I've fell in sandwich love with all of the ones I've tried so far. Also, their focaccia bread is delightful.  Oh and don't leave without an order of the potato salad. It's fabulous!",

I am a very light eater so we decided to share a sandwich, bowl of soup and potato salad. We got the New York Mile High on marble rye with potato salad and chicken noodle soup. When I first took a bite of the soup I told my husband it was probably the best non-homemade chicken noodle soup I've ever had. That alone would have made me happy. But then I took a bite of the sandwich. OMG! It was heaven! The corned beef is perfectly seasoned and the combination with the coleslaw is perfect! We both decided that this was the best sandwich we'd ever had! They're huge so sharing is no problem. The potato salad was great too. These guys definitely know what they're doing! My biggest complaint now is that I'm back home, 2000 miles away from Vegas, and I'm already craving the mile high!!",

I ordered 1 of each for the 4 of us to share. I was impressed with the size (meat was piled high) and the quality of the rye bread. Sandwiches are really good!  Below someone said that it is not as good as the NY Katz's deli. Katz has been on the lower east side for over 100 years and is known in NYC as one of the best. I am a New Yorker and have been going there for over 50 years (been to the Carnegie, the Stage as well as probably almost every neighborhood deli n Manhattan). To compare the elite of NYC to a deli elsewhere I think is somewhat rediculous! Get real!!!",

This food was awful, it has gone downhill in the worst way.  Kudos to the chicken soup but the corn beef was terrible and I know as I grew up with the deli experience. I myself had a pastrami.  It was good but I had to return the sandwich. The rye it was on was stale and even the meat slicer agreed that my sandwich was stale.  She then pulled it off my stale bread and put it on some other fresher bread.  This is restaurant suicide to not offer a fresh sandwich to the customer.  The sandwich was not the legendary triple thick either it was skinny and not worth the money.  Honestly keep your money folks this is no way even close to a New York Deli.",

    "text": "I can't personally review this deli, so I have my family here to assist me. My family demanded that I review the deli and RAVE about it because they loved eating here...several times!   If I could imagine being back in NYC and eating at a NY deli, this would be the closest to that NYC deliciousness out west. My aunt had the beef and cheddar melt on focaccia. The bread smelled amazing and looked like it could actually control the piles of beef and perfect amount of cheddar in this sandwich. The bread almost succeeded, but it was so delicious that almost was good enough. The beef (I got a sample from the deli man)was okay , but only because my family made them make it less rare (NNNOOOOOO!). I bet you it is amazing without the extra cooking. I tried the pastrami and my world was rocked. It was equally as great as Carnegie Deli's pastrami at the Mirage, and the size of this sandwich was larger than my head! At first my family was going to eat only a half. Oops. The entire sandwich was gone in moments.  The best part of this meal according to my aunt? The chicken noodle soup. I see all the reviews mention this soup. Since I cannot have it, I don't know exactly what it tastes like, but my aunt said it was gorgeous, and that is a fantastic compliment. She said that it is the best chicken noodle soup she had ever had (which is blasphemy coming from her household), and she said it reminds her of the chicken noodle soup she always wanted when she was sick because one minute after eating it you start to feel better immediately. The soup tasted like home and warmed her up for our cold walk up and down the strip. She did not stop talking about said soup for over a few hours, and she still mentions this soup a week or two after she left. So if you don't feel well or have a wicked headache or just feel like a NY deli comfort food moment? Come to Greenberg's - you'll find my family and I there ready and waiting.",

I can see how they could screw up an order if the customer had ordered something out of the ordinary but what could be more common than pastrami on rye?",

    "text": "Unless you are prepared to spend $30-$40 a person on food in vegas, like at Outback steakhouse, horrible casino cafes, buffets, or even more on fancy restaurants, like Craft, or Spago, then Greenberg Deli really isnt too bad. In fact, i've come to Vegas more than a couple dozen times, have eaten at many places and this deli tops the list for affordable (under $10 a person) spot to grab lunch/ dinner.   Service is pretty quick, no fuss, you seat yourself. This spot is located among many other small food courts joints, all in rows mimicking the feel of a busy area in New York.   Had the Sam and Emmas, which was ham, pastrami, roast beef, with lettuce, onions, and thousand island. For $8.95, it comes with either potato salad or chips. i got the chips, which is a 0.5 ounce bag... with about 5 pieces of chips inside. Next time, im getting the potato salad.. better deal. Drink is another $2.25. The meat quality is good. Pastrami is well brined and well flavored. Tender and with depth to its flavor. I was happy.   The boy had some chicken and ham sandwich, with bacon, and lettuce and some sauce. it was also yummy, though i prefer pastrami and roast beef over chicken breast any day.",

    "text": "My girlfriend has been going to Vegas for years, and raves about this place, so I was pleased that we finally got to grab a bite here on a recent trip.  We ordered a couple sandwiches to go, and they looked damn good.  Prices seem high at first, but frankly, it is the Strip, and well, it's not like sandwiches are any cheaper in a real NYC deli.    We'd already had a couple nice dinners on our stay, and well, it was nice to have something that wasn't really pricey or greasy diner food.  And well, the sandwich was so good that I immediately walked her over to the Bellagio, and proposed in front of the fountains.  Ok, I was going to propose anyway, and didn't eat the sandwich until later (they were for the plane), but it makes a good story.  The real story is that the sandwich was still pretty damn good after a few hours, although it would've been better fresh.    Was it as good as getting a sandwich at a real NYC deli?  No, but if you want the real thing, you pretty much are resigned to flying to New York or maybe some retirement communities in Florida.  Outside of that, the meat and toppings were quality.  Fresh bread would've been better, but they did at least ship in a good brand.  The food court is fun too, and better than most of them for both food and ambience.  I'd say the one at Paris is up there on ambience, but frankly, the food options are a bit more limited.  I'd totally go back.",

Worst sandwiches i have ever had, poor excuse for a vegas sandwich shop... how you guys are in business is a mystery. I ordered a simple toasted beef brisket sandwich, it comes out 20minutes later on untoasted plain and slightly stale sourdough bread, the beef is so dry it DEMANDS au jus, the sandwich comes with nothing else on it for 9.95$. I ask for au jus...\"o we dont have it sorry, use mayonnaise\". \"First off i don't like mayonnaise, second i see the beef in a smoker right there what do you guys do with the juice, throw it away??\" \"Yes we do\". \"So i tell them look i have never heard of a sandwich shop selling beef brisket without au jus (the freaking sandwich comes with liquid dumbass) this is to dry to eat i would like to order something else\". So the lady tells me i will need to stand in line again (easily 45 minute line) if i wanted another sandwich. I march up there and demand my money back now only to realize i am not the only one taking my sandwich back.  On top of that they have an expediter that does not speak english, so picture somebody handing out meals and when you verify your order they just look at you with that blank stare \"no hablo ingles\".... why put them as expediter!! IDIOTS HERE. As we walk out we see the manager and ask him about not having au jus and that your sandwich is dry as a desert, his reply is simply ..\"well this is a deli\"",

The decor is True to what you would find in a deli in New York and the seating outside of the restaurant would make you think that you are actually in NYC.  The menu gives you the choice of soup/salad, toasted sandwiches or cold sandwiches. To start you have to choose what kind of bread you want. You have the choice of rye, Reuben, white or wheat bread to name a few. I ordered Vinny's Deluxe on wheat bread, and it is a cold sandwich with roast beef, pastrami, turkey, muenster, deli mustard and mayo. The sandwich was delicious. The meat is freshly cut in front of you as you wait and bread was fresh. Also, I have to say that I was surprised by how big the sandwich was. My advice is to share the sandwich if you can because it is very filling. In addition to the sandwich I also ordered a house salad as a side. Service was just OK. The person who rang us up was not very friendly and frankly seemed to be anxious to go home. The sandwich itself was about $13 but I had some left overs as I wasn't able to eat it all.  I really enjoyed the food and would definitely visit again when I'm in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I've never been to New York, so have never had a True New York deli sandwich. Greenberg's is the closest I've come, but according to others, this is the real stuff. I'm glad because the East Coast is just way too far to travel just for for a sandwich!  Ever since I had my first Greenberg's sandwich in 2006, I've needed to make my way to the far back corner of New York, New York to get my fix whenever I'm Las Vegas. I've had the corned beef, the pastrami, and most recently tried a combo of corned beef and brisket. All were huge, delicious, and really nice and fresh! Every single time I've been there, I've also had the potato salad, which is like no other potato salad I've had anywhere else. It is tasty, almost light (with not too much creamy stuff--which I think might be sour cream and not mayonnaise), and has a nice dill flavoring.  Greenberg's sandwiches are all made to order when you request them. Once you've stated your choice of bread (I love the marble rye) and meat, the guys behind the counter actually grab a slab of your protein choice and slice it up right in front of you. If you're lucky, they've sliced a little extra, which gets piled on the plate beside your sandwich along with a dill pickle. You'll also get to choose if you'd like some brown deli mustard. Since the restaurant is cafeteria style, you can then select your chips, dessert, drink (even wine!), and condiments before getting into line to pay. There are a few booths inside the deli, and \"open air\" tables outside the deli walls (but still inside the casino) in a little city street style setting. It's fun setting and a great meal.",

The moist corned beef in my sandwich was thinly sliced, helping all the succulence and flavor to be liberated.  There are about six bread choices.  The ordering process is simple.  Order, and the order taker slices the meat and hands your completed sandwich to you.  Then walk a few steps to your left to order your drink and other sides.

We were walking around New York and had a really bad burger at burger bar nearby. Had we known this place was so good we would have eaten here twice, take my advice skip the burger bar and go to Greenberg's! The meat was so tender and full of flavor it makes a vegatarian want to eat here. This sandwich was big enough to satisfy my big body appetite. I forgot what she had, she said it was good but I couldn't take attention off my sandwich. \"Yes dear\" I replied to her and kept savoring my sandwich. Oh ya, they had some moist, tender and delicious cookies, get some!",

But regardless she didn't go ask someone to come help us just kinda brushed it off like we weren't talking and asking questions, and for a $35 lunch for two, just two sandwiches, drinks and one bag of chips I would've liked some better service is all.   The sandwich I got was the Vinni Deluxe it was good with Brisket, Turkey and Pastrami. I could handle only two meats on the sandwich because it was too huge, so I shared my Brisket and ate some on the side, it was delicious and the pickle was good too.",

    "text": "I'll preface this by saying I'm from Los Angeles, grew up eating in LA delis so I know what good, old school deli food is and should be.  Greenberg's isn't in that league, but there's no place in Vegas that IS in that league, that's just the way it is in this city.  Having said that, their food is somewhat better than I've had at the other deli in town  I tried.  Stopped here for lunch.  They are located in the \"village eatery\" section of NYNY hotel/casino.  Ordered a corned beef sandwich on rye with side of potato salad, and a chocolate egg cream.  The sandwich was okay, the amount of corned beef was fairly good, although nothing to write home about.  Fairly tender, with a few bites of scattered \"chewy\" spots that weren't too bad.  Fairly flavorful, maybe a bit dry. Again, if you're like me and grew up eating fabulous \"real\" deli food, you won't be too impressed.  This sandwich will give you a little feeling of \"home\", especially if you've lived in Vegas for years and are yearning for a good corned beef sandwich and would do anything to have one, even a sub-standard version.    The potato salad was good.  Nothing aMAYzing but better than grocery store deli stuff.  The egg cream was okay, nice chocolate flavor.   Prices are high, as they are anywhere in a strip eaterie.  No getting around that.  The solution:  split the sandwich, it was definitely large enough for two people.  Splitting stuff is the only way to make it easier on your wallet during a Vegas vacay!    Would I eat here again?  Maybe.  I'd have to be in serious \"longing for a corned beef on rye\" mode, which I am about once a year.  i suppose this place would fill that need.  Maybe...lol...",

Greenberg's sandwiches are out of this world! The meat, regardless of what you order, is the best I've ever tasted anywhere, moist and delicious. The bread selection gives you many choices to work with so you can put together the perfect sandwich. Make sure you bring your appetite because the pile of meat you get in every sandwich is no snack size portion but, neither are the prices. By the time you add some chips and a drink you're talking at least 20 bucks which is typical for Vegas but a bit much for a sandwich meal. The staff is friendly and helpful, the guys behind the counter help you along and will even let you sample the meats before choosing the right one. I make it a point to have a Greenberg's sandwich every time I'm in Vegas and you should too!",

We split a hot pastrami sandwich. Pastrami really needs to be just right for me to like it. And I did like it, not as good as the real delis in New York but it was decent. I mean it was no Subway.   The service in the deli was extremely attentive and they made everything fantastically. The pastrami was just a little moist and had you add your own condiments.Their pickles were crunchy and yummy (I had bad Carnegie Deli pickles the day before) and the sandwiches come with a bag of Lays original chips. But we bought a bag of Wise chips just because we could. And I had a root beer in a bottle as it should be. Everything was delicious don't get me wrong, there was nothing outstandingly wrong about this place but the hype.  I think that this place got a little over hyped for me because once I read about it I was extremely excited, but once I actually got there and ate it just didn't live up to my expectations of a New York Deli. It just has a lot to live up to.",

I'm a big fan of corned beef and pastrami, so naturally I'm always keeping for an eye out that can make a good sandwich of those meats.  I read several reviews about getting a corned beef and pastrami sandwich and just knew I had to come here.  The meat was delicious and they piled it on.  It's good to see them slice the meat when you order it rather than other restaurants that preslice and just assemble the sandwich when you order.  The only downside for me (and this is very minor) is the side that is included wit the sandwich.  I ordered the chips with my sandwich and received a bag with approximately 7 chips in there (there might have been more if you count the crumbs, but I'm pretty sure it started with 7).",

My sandwich $8.50.  I have been at delis and had the same thing for $16.95.  The only negative is the whole hotel carries Pepsi products.",

I came here to pick up my tickets for Zumanity and I happen to stop by this place for a quick lunch. This place specializes in sandwices. I got the Vinny which consist of your choice of bread on thousand island spread, turkey, pastrami and cheese. It comes with a pickle on the side and they give your A LOT of meat. It's enough for share for 2 people. They also have salad, soup and chips. This place is definately worth a try and very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "I knew it was completely fake, but I was still taken in by the Village Eateries.  Walking along the street and getting a hot, heaping pastrami sandwich at Greenberg's Deli was the highlight of my time at New York New York (other than winning a few bucks at blackjack).  While I can appreciate the high-falutin' fanciness of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian, it still felt more \"real\" to walk down the streets of New York New York (although the screaming people plunging down a roller-coaster hole in the \"sky\" was a bit startling).  Greenberg's has the feel of a New York deli, with the brusque sandwich-makers and the impatient register-lady.  It makes me nostalgic for the deliberate, saucy rudeness of Ed Debevic's (LA).  To use quotations just one more time, Greenberg's was as \"New York\" as could be.",
