The flautas were cooked perfectly & complete with top notch guacamole. Rice and Beans rocked & The fish tacos were great too, fish was mouth watering and I loved the way they chopped the cabbage. Oh BTW to the poor dunce with the one one star review, (fish tacos traditionally come with cabbage so your \"trip around the world\" obviously didnt include Tijuana). Frank was an absolute pleasure and has definitely won the hearts of myself and my family! See you soon!",

    "text": "This was one of the bad dining experiences you have every so often in life.  It was recommended to me so I thought I'd try it. There were a couple of red flags right off the bat. The first was that it was 5:30 in the evening, prime dinner hour and we were the only ones in there, however after a few minutes people did start coming in, it was never busy though. The second was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fback.kitchen&s=3817fb68cde16217a4b7da084fb050acab24fb1a25d3ab4f40dc5966258e83e1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">back.kitchen</a> door was wide open and it was hot outside. The third was the person taking the orders was in a mood lethargic and really wasn't into helping us at all. When prodded she answered basic questions about the food. There was three of us, my son, his girlfriend, and myself. My sons gf and I ordered pork burritos and my son ordered a brc burrito. When you pay there is room for a tip. I always tip but I want to see the service first as this was a fast food restaurant. The same girl that took our order brought us our food kind of tossed it on the table and told me that there were holders on the wall to get the plastic silverware ( not understanding why I should tip for this). My son was ok with his burrito but his gf and I did not like ours at all. I didn't get the meat in mine my sons gf did and said it was tasteless. The rice was mushed together with some kind of seasoned salt and the beans were out of the can. One of the people that worked there asked how everything was and I told him not good. I didn't like the food and was going to head to McDonalds for something better. He called both the girl taking the orders and the cook out. The girl taking the order said she though my son and his gf ordered the same thing a brc burrito and I ordered the one with the pork, yet she tossed my sons gf the pork burrito. The cook looked at me and said Ne not liking the food was a matter of opinion and she hopes I enjoy another Mexican restaurant. I will and do because I love Mexican food. I only gave it one star because the food was cooked and so far none of us has gotten sick. Oh yeah one more thing the cook has long hair that should be kept in a net. Thank God I didn't have any of it in my food. This disaster cost me $28.00 I actually feel really bad that I paid them. It is not worth it. If you want good Mexican food go to Chili Verde. Also I feel bad about writing a bad review but this was exceptional.",

Place closes at 5 and I popped in 4:10-15ish (some places give you THAT look you know) and place was lil slow as to be expected.  Frank the owner was there and I gotta tell you he goes above and beyond to provide an experience.  We ended up chitchatting some before, during and even after my order.  I left nearly at close time and never got any bad vibes.  He's real cool, real humble and I found out we both made our way to the 702 roughly the same time, out from SoCal.     All that aside the food was great, got an adobada torta (based on his recommendation) and I gotta tell you the pork was done perfect and their secret sauce put it up there.  Perhaps the best torta I've had to date.  I say this cause I was listening to Pandora a lil while and I went from a whole torta to half a half (you'll know what I'm saying) in a matter of minutes.  I seriously devoured that torta!  I also ended up getting their pork nachos (which I've never had that way) put some of their home made hot salsa and went to town on it too.  In all the torta is a definite 5/5 it was simply awesome... the nachos could've used a lil something something else too but for my taste get 3.5-4/5 not bad.     Next time I'm trying their fish tacos which he said has the same secret sauce or depending on what time I go might get their breakfast burrito.  I'm jotting this one down as a definite go-back.",

    "text": "This place is great! It may look like just an ordinary \"Robertos\" type mexican restaurant, but it's far from that. The food is awesome, it actually tastes like it's homemade and made with love. It also had an authentic mexican feel to it, like it was made from family recipes.  Phrank or Frank however he spells his name, is a character. While there he had a Snoop Dogg reference for almost everything on the menu. Like, \"This burrito is off the hizzle.\" So any man that can quote a rapper and make delicious food is good in my book.  I had the nachos, because Phrank told me they were \"bomb!\" So I had to go with that. I was kinda hesitant because I'm not a big fan of chili verde sauce, only liking it from a few places. The nacho chips we re slathered with this delicious green sauce and topped with cheese. Phrank was right...they were bomb! My girlfriend had the special of the day which were the fish tacos. She's had her share of fish tacos and she admitted that these were the best she's ever had. The fish was crispy, the cabbage had texture and the cream sauce they put over it was outstanding. Even the beans and rice it came with didn't have that \"straight out of the can\" taste to it. Phrank also gave us a sample of the ceviche he makes, and it was great. A lot like lomi salmon at some hawaiian restaurants. It had a strong lemon taste, but you could still taste every single ingredient in the dish. It was top notch.  Like their quote says, \"Not The Best, Just None Better,\" This place is one of the best \"Strip Mall Mexican Restaurants\" I've been to. I'm glad I live so close, there were a lot of things I wanted to try.",

Sometimes food is so good, I actually laugh out loud, and I can say my chourico breakfast burrito today made me do just that. What an enjoyable experience!

    "text": "This was an upscale version of a taco shop. For the most part same taco shop fare but higher prices and more adjectives in their menu, such as, \"flawless\" and \"delectable\".  The owner took our order. I asked him what he recommended and he said people like the fish taco and the tortas. I then asked him what his favorite was and he replied \"I like them all it is like picking a favorite granchild\" to which I said \"but everyone has a favorite.\" He eventually told me until the article last week (which I have no idea of) barbacoa was the most popular. So I tried the two taco plate, one fish and one barbacoa.  The barbacoa was a little dry and not a lot of flavor, also the portion of barbacoa for the price in the taco was pretty small.  The fish taco was pretty good, fried cod I think, it was a pretty big piece of fish and it was fried well, a little greasy, but crispy. The plate also came with a small portion of rice and beans.  I got the hot salsa - owner said not as hot as habaneros, but it still had a pretty good kick.  Also, a medium Jamaica drink (free refills) - I paid a little under $12 - which I think is expensive for a taco shop.  The food came on paper plates, which I would expect, but again for the price it seems like you should get more.  It just didn't seem that authentic - but I am more of a Tacos El Gordo type of girl personally.",

I never thought I would have to mention \"by the way dont put cabbage in my steak tacos\"...... but I guess you have to do that with this restaurant... anyways I ended up just picking the cabbage off... the steak wasnt as good as I thought it would be ....a weird seasoning was used.... pretty much expensive tacos for nothing... and also the fact that I paid basically 3 dollars a taco .... I paid 6 and change for 4 tacos at Tony's Tacos on Fort Apache by far the best tacos on the west side smh and it doesn't come with cabbage (the way it's suppose to be)  FYI the only tacos that should come with cabbage are fish tacos and specifically finely shredded cabbage not obnoxious chunks that were in my asada burrito... most def don't know what all the hype was about, were y'all really being serious about these reviews..

    "text": "Best. Damn. Breakfast. Burrito!   Just 10 minutes off The Vegas Strip, this family-run gem is hidden in a strip mall off Decatur & Sunset behind an ARCO gas station. In my opinion, it should be front and center, with marquee arrows pointing to their location flashing, \"EAT HERE!\" \"EAT HERE!\"  Location: Quaint dining room with 2- and 4-person seating. Love the jazz motif...! A little unexpected for a Mexican joint, but tastefully exhibits Frank's love and respect for jazz music. (Something I can appreciate as a classically trained, former pianist.) A great spot for a quick bite. Considering my sweetie and I came after the lunch rush (around 2pm), the restaurant had a steady flow of patrons for the 45 minutes we were there. Oh, and the restroom was clean. I don't like to eat anywhere if the restroom isn't up to par.  Food: I only tried one item on the menu because I wanted a breakfast burrito (at 2pm) and it was the BEST DAMN BREAKFAST BURRITO I've eaten in a long time! #1) Phrank's serves breakfast all day. One star is specifically for that - being mindful to us all-day breakfast lovers. #2) No frills: My burrito came out piping hot in a deliciously fresh tortilla with scrambled eggs, melty cheese, extra crispy bacon, & potatoes... and not filler potatoes, like some restaurants tend to do, where hash makes up 3/4 of the burrito... these were thinly sliced chips - just enough. #3) My sweetie had a carne asada taco. He said it was nicely seasoned, great flavors, and he loved their salsa. #4) Horchata. Order it. 'Nuff said.   People: From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a smile. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful! (I'm sad not to have asked her name.) As we were preparing to leave, we were asked by a man if we enjoyed our food. Of course, I let him know... \"I'm going to Yelp about this being one of the best damn burritos I've ever eaten!\" The man happened to be Frank himself and we stopped to chat with him for a while about the food, his restaurant, and exchanged names of a few jazz artists we enjoyed. It was a delight to meet him and exchange pleasantries with the table of friends and family from which he stood.    Right before we left, the woman behind the counter thoughtfully offered to refill my Horchata since we were hitting the road back to CA (uh... yes, please!), and Frank and his family wished us safe travels.  Long story short: The breakfast burrito is enough to bring me back on our next visit to Vegas (and write this super-long review). The service and the people make me dream we lived closer. ;-)",

    "text": "This place is legit.  Not to be compared in any way with a Robertos other than interior seating style, Frank serves up an amazing variety of tasty Mexican eats.   Frank can often be seen working in the restaurant. You'll know him by his big smile and warm demeanor. It's clear he opened this restaurant because he loves to feed people with the delicious meals he provides - he'll often make quick rounds through the tables with a \"thumbs up?\" look, making sure you're happy with his eats.   My favorite - Adobada Torta. Thin, soft bread (almost like a Mexican style pita bread), warmed to a nice crisp on the flattop. Crispy and flavorful Adobada pork is generously added with a fresh, cooling slaw. A nice combination of crunch, fat, heat, salt, and fresh. A good sized meal even for big-eaters, this is my \"go to\" at less than $8.  Zero complaints about this place. I'd love to see him open up a spot with more tables and a \"dinner\" atmosphere, but until then, this is the lunch spot you can't miss.",

I've had their fish taco plate, other than the beans and rice sides the fish tacos were AMAZING. By far the best fish tacos I've had anywhere.  The fish were large crispy on the outside tender on the inside pieces, light and not greasy. The combination of all the fish with cabbage, green onion, cilantro, tartar sauce, and in my case lime and their hot sauce was AMAZING. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. I'll be back for you fish tacos.  Their carne asada torta was...  Oops sorry for the drool.  Their Carne asada torta was very delicious too. Well I might have reached my quota for using the word amazing but don't worry the carne asada tortas are equally as amazing as the fish tacos. I've seen other tortas that are bulky, bready, and just look good because of the huge size not flavor. Size isn't gigantic and not bready, so every bite was just of everything I wanted, something very tasty. There's probably even more ingredients than bread. I'll be back for you too LOL.  I didn't have this but a friend had their enchiladas because it was mentioned in the lvrj as Phat Phrank's signature dish. Now that looked like meal right there. I'm sure it has to be really good too just from what I've already had.  Plus it had a fried egg on it.  Anytime you throw a fried egg on anything it's instantly good.  Location is perfect for me, I'm always in the area though honestly I never knew they were there until a UYE.   I like the musical instrument on the walls and how it's clean. Seats maybe 20-30 people.  Service was very good, friendly. Phrank and the lady that was there often checked on us, refilling drinks, bring food out quickly, conversing with us and making it an experience not like here is your food and now get out when your done. lol.   They no longer have raspberry ice tea.   Can't wait to go there tomorrow. Wait their not open on the weekends!? This has to be a typo and they close at 6 PM. MAN I can't win.  All good, fresh and delicious food need a break too. AMAZING.",

It seemed like she kept messing up the tickets to the kitchen because they had to keep asking her about the orders. Sure enough, I was supposed to get a carnitas, a carne asada and a barbacoa taco. Pretty sure I got 2 carne asadas and one chicken. Lovely. Didn't want to complain because it would probably take forever to correct it. The tacos are large and the meat portion was more than fair. The taste was... eh. Didn't hate it, didn't love it. Coworker felt the same way about his order, the torta. Next time the Mexican craving hits, it'll be back to my old faithful, el dorado cantina.",

It's always hard to get off work in time to get here before they close at 6. Finally, I made it out of work in time to stop by for some food.   I came in and was greeted by the very friendly owner. He took my order and made some idle chit chat and then went back to cook up my grub. I tried the chicken taco and breakfast burrito with bacon and also took a small bite from my fella's carnitas torta. The chicken in the taco was incredibly moist and filled with lots of cabbage, onion and cilantro. I'm a big fan of all the fresh veggies that are included. Even better with the flavorful and spicy chile. The breakfast burrito was perfectly sized and every bite had the perfect amount of egg, bacon, potato and cheese in every bite. So great when I added the green chile or spicy red on top. The torta was great too. I would probably ask for no mayo if I was ordering for myself, but that's just a personal preference. The meat was really juicy and flavorful.    Phrank was very friendly and chit chatted with me before during and after our transaction was over. Such a great customer service experience and the food is good and cheap to boot. What more can a girl ask for. Looking forward to making this a regular spot on my food rotation.",

We are pretty picky about our breakfast burritos but the reviews were good and prices looked decent so we figured we would try this place.   We both got the carne asada breakfast burrito add guacamole. The burrito was a perfect size. And the portions of meat, potato cheese and guacamole was perfect. The potatoes are a little crunchy which I loved!  They have a good variety of different burritos. I can't wait to come back here and try something different.   The service was amazing. The staff was funny and energetic. It looks like a place where u order then they call your number and you get up and grab your meal but we sat down and they brought our food to us. 3 different staff members asked how we were and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. The owner was working and out talking to everyone. Making everyone feel welcome and comfortable. He came over and made sure we got refills before we left. Honestly all around this place was great! Such a good spot to go to before your own the road or if you don't want to spend too much money but want a good meal. It's very casual so if your looking for something fancy this isn't the place for you. SO GOOD!!",

The fish taco was ok, nothing exciting just your run of the mill fish taco. Lots of lettuce and no tomatoes in the pico de gallo and only 1 tortilla (most restaurants serve them with two). At over $4 for a single taco (no beans or rice or even tortilla chips) I thought it was pretty overpriced. The chicken taco was pretty boring, again no pico de gallo and tons of lettuce. The shredded chicken was lacking flavor so I piled on the salsa. Breakfast looked more reasonably priced and seems to have good reviews so I'll probably give it a try one day. Kinda disappointed!",

    "text": "I was finally able to try Phat Phrank's after much word of mouth. They close at 6 and don't open at all on weekends, so it was never on my radar. But I can see myself picking up dinner from here now that it's on my way home from work. If yelp allowed half stars I'd give 4.5.  I had carne asada and adobada tacos. They were both served in corn tortillas that held up well to the filling of meat, cabbage, onion, cilantro and scallion. The hot salsa might be hot to other people, it has a rich, smoky flavor beyond the heat.  The rice and beans grew on me, especially with a little salsa added. Both of them are fairly simple preparations.  Flavors overall are very clean. Their adobada is fried to a crisp and adds just enough savory goodness. The carne asada feels a little greasy at first bite but is melt in your mouth good by bite three.  Frank is a gracious, smiling host whose passion is apparent in the very first impression. He clearly takes pride in his work and enjoys serving his guests.  I'll be back, and if the rest of the menu is as good as those first two tacos, I may bump them up to 5 stars.",

    "text": "I've been reading about Phat Phrank's in several local newspapers and magazines and finally decided to give it a try. It's in a small strip mall off Decatur and the 215, down the street from Rhythm Kitchen and owned by a Cali transplant named (you guessed it...) Frank. While they do have some traditional Mexican dishes, this restaurant isn't your typical 'authentic' taco shop. It's a more modern take on Mexican/Southern Cali food.  Their tacos are a little larger than some street tacos elsewhere, using 6-inch tortillas instead of the 4-inch ones. The two tacos I had (carne asada and adobada) came with a good sized portion of steak and pork, respectively, with a little cabbage and cilantro on top, with your choice of 4 salsas on the side. While the carne asada taco wasn't the best I've had, it was still very good and the adobada was so tender, but crispy around the edges and packed with intense flavors.  And the churros... mmmmm... the churros. They are reason enough to stop by Phat Phrank's. Four of them stacked on a plate and drizzled with caramel, chocolate and vanilla. Big enough to share, but I refuse to.  The customer service here is second to none, with the staff bringing your food out when it's ready and Frank walking around chatting up all the patrons and checking to make sure everything's ok. He even brought out a sample of his ceviche for me to try. Tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and chopped fish cooked in citrus juices. It also had a good bit of heat to it.  They also have a breakfast menu (which I haven't tried) with breakfast burritos, huevos rancheros, and spam+chile, among other things.",

Personally, I think I could get a more authentic fish taco at Rubio's and a better tasting carnitas burrito at Chipotle--and at 1/2 the price. There wasn't enough flavor or spice or anything, really. Was asked what kind of salsa do I want? Um, I don't know, how about all of them? How do I know which one is best if I can't try them all? Total turn off. My burrito was dry and I didn't like having to beg for more soda. For God's sake invest in a salsa bar & let people get their own soda! One more tip: don't run out of utensils. Especially when customers don't appear to be lining up. When business is that slow, you shouldn't really run out of anything or make your guests wait while you restock the forks.",

Ended up spending $8.37 on a standard bacon breakfast burrito.  Not sure if I was charged extra for my cup of water or for the 2 little salsa containers.  Customer service wasn't super welcoming.  It seemed like there were a bunch of regulars there at the time so the lady seemed very attentive to them.  Took a little while for the food to come out and in the end I can't say the burrito knocked my socks off.  It was decent at best.  Originally, I gave this review 2 stars but I would probably give this place a chance for redemption - with their lunch menu!",

Phat Phrank's was found (luckily) on our Yelp app by searching \"breakfast burritos\" - imagine two people from Hawaii (where we have zero legit Mexican options) who just got off the airplane at 7am. My hubby is from Cali and misses good Mexican food on the daily. So, of course, I'm not going to say \"no\" to breakfast burritos. And a five-star worthy breakfast burrito?! C'mon, #feedthehubby  When we pulled in, there were zero cars in the lot and zero customers. Not gonna lie, I was suspect. But, trust #YelpNation to get it right. Jacob greeted us with a smile and recommended basically ALL of the breakfast burrito meat choices. My hubby and I both decided on carne asada breakfast burritos. Winners!!!! They were tasty, not greasy, fat, and I am totally in love with the thin fried potato - my mouth is now watering, just great. Jacob also gave us all the salsas to try and they were all super tasty. He was super friendly and made our meal at Phat Phrank's that much more enjoyable. To top everything off, we got a holy yumminess of 32oz Horchata #happybellies  This place is a serious gem and I wish we could have stopped by for lunch or dinner. But, there's no doubt, Phat Phrank's is in our rotation from now on \"When in Vegas...\"",

We live in Hawaii and unfortunately the Mexican food there is horrible for the most part. My wife is from Arizona so she has been feening for some good Mexican. We found this place on yelp and drove out the day before. I've never had a torta before and almost ordered the carne Asada fries but while talking with Phrank he explained to me what they were and let me swap my order. Maybe the Carne asada fried would have been better, I don't know but I love the carnita torta and next time I'm in Vegas will be getting it again.   Also me and my wife talked a little with Phrank and he is a pretty awesome guy. Just sayin. We were actually in a pretty bad mood coming in here but Phrank is one of those just warm people to talk to. We only talked with him for maybe 5 mins but he put us in a better mood and that torta from heaven put me in an even better one. Thankfully my work brings me to Vegas (well not really thankfully) a lot so I'll def be back",

No more Roberto's drive thru for this girl.  When the craving hits I have to drive across town to Phranks.  The breakfast burritos are about the same size as other places but whats inside is a whole other level.  The eggs are cooked to order and not over cooked.  No rubber eggs here.  The potatoes are sliced thin and seasoned.  I think the potatoes are what really sets it apart for me.  They are so good.  I usually don't get meat in mine but have hubby gets bacon or carne asada and gives it 2 thumbs up.  Ask for green sauce.  It is spicy, garlicky goodness.  They need to bottle it.    I've had lunch a few times.  Fish taco plate and Phat Phranks Nachos are my go to items.  Both are good.  I love the chili verde on the nachos.  I wish they put more on the nachos than just cheese and chili verde.  A super nacho with that verde sauce would be amazing.  I'm sure I could add on if I asked.  I'll have to try that next time.",

The woman at the counter was extremely friendly, helpful, and patient answering my questions and offering suggestions.  There was no one in line behind me, so I felt I had plenty of time to look the menu over and ask questions, etc.  I got the famous Adobada torta-  the seasoning on the pork was spot on and a huge plus for me was not having any fatty pieces of meat in my sandwich because I really hate that when I am eating any type of food.  I told my friend that the torta was one of the best food items I have ever had.  The sandwich is big and will definitely fill you up- lots of pork no doubt.  Not like other places where they fill your torta with all lettuce and you have to search for the remaining ingredients.  The torta also has a cilantro sauce and the bread is toasted!!  We also tried the fish tacos-  these were good too, but they did not compare to the torta.  Nothing that really stuck out for me on the fish tacos, but I have absolutely no complaints either.  Large fried pieces of white fish on a tortilla with cabbage.  I equally loved the chips and guacamole-- homemade chip (bonus) and a very nice serving size of guacamole at a very reasonable price.  The flavor of the guacamole was delicious- smooth and a lovely creamy guacamole taste.  Can't go wrong! I think people complain about the chips because they are more all natural rather than loaded or over salted.  I see no problem at all with that.  Have an open mind and try something new!  On my way back to the airport Sunday, all I could think about was Phat Phranks and how I wanted to have another torta. Sadly, they are closed on Sundays.  Can you send me one or two or five please!?!?!?  I have nothing but an Adobada torta on my mind.   You can bet I will be back next time I am in Vegas- there is no doubt about that.",

    "text": "We came to phat phranks for some Mexican food, more like a 3.5 star restaurant. We ordered the huevos rancheros, breakfast burrito and some flautas. The huevos rancheros came with either red or green sauce, I picked green because it has pork in the sauce. The dish was really greasy for my taste, the beans, eggs and the fried chips were swimming in grease. It wasn't a traditional huevos rancheros. The fried potatoes were delicious And the dish was okay, just too greasy. The flautas were crispy and tasty with fresh guacamole. The service was good.  I had to give it 3.5 stars due to the greasy meal and also, we were charged for tap water. I'm not sure if that is a Vegas thing, but it was a bit unusual for me to see that.",

When I first arrived, I noticed immediately no visible menu or pictures of the food to decide what I would be eating.  Instead, I'm greeted with a room of musical instruments on display and a small laminated menu of foods.  On the menu, again no visible photos to see what id be ordering.  If people were in line behind me, I'd feel almost pressured to make an unjust decision.  For this reason mainly I deducted one star in my review.  Items Ordered:  Two Fish Tacos Combination Plate $9.99  The fish tacos with there highly recommended secret sauce reminded me instantly of Rubio's.  Same great taste I've become very fond of and the rice / beans made just like grandma use to do when I was a kid.  Very authentic Mexican flavors and definitely left a lasting impression.  I would come back again, but the invisible menu and having to rely on staff for refills really turned me off.  Very awkward way of business to treat a Mexican food joint almost like a deli.  That's my two cents, but excellent food!",

These burritos consisted of store bought rotisserie chicken, potato chips from a bag and dry scrambled eggs in a tortilla, served on a paper plate with two packets of terrible green salsa.

But at over $4, quite pricey. The chorizo breakfast burrito was ok. Light on the chorizo in my opinion. There's no salsa bar nor did my waitress give me any type of salsa/hot sauce with my meal. Actually no one asked if I wanted green or red or anything. My coworker got some red sauce brought out with his tacos. He said his tacos were ok, but nothing special. My coworker that ordered the barbacoa beef said he would have rather eaten at qdoba. So that says a lot about his meal. Given the reviews, I expected a lot more from this place. If you're charging $3 a taco, it better be a pretty damn good taco. In my opinion, taco y taco is much better.",

    "text": "I rarely leave reviews on Yelp but this particular experience was too noteworthy not to share.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with 2 meats, chips and salsa and rice.  When I arrived I was told my bill was $16 which seemed much higher than the prices advertised on their online menu which Yelp redirects you to when choosing  menu.  When I started questioning the prices the server said I was wrong and gave me a printed out menu.  I told her these prices do not match what is online.  She shrugged.  I took out my phone and told her she charged me $2.00 for rice add-on when the menu states $0.75 and her excuse was they charge double when it is ordered as a side as opposed to adding on to an entree.  There is no mention of this deceptive practice on either menu (online or printed out).  Furthermore the price of the breakfast burrito is listed as $5.99 and I was charged $7.99.  When I showed her this, she said, \"Oh we are locked out and cannot change that menu any more.\"  I said these are significant discrepencies of over $3.00 for what should have been a $12-13 meal.  Her response, \"You don't have to come back.\"  I asked who the manager is and the heavy set blonde responded said she was, I told her she needs to fix her business since this is unacceptable.  Her attitude was disgusting from a customer service perspective, first telling me I was wrong on the pricing and then making an excuse that they can no longer modify the menu as if that was my problem.  GUESS WHAT?  If your menu is out of date and you can't modify it any more for failure to pay your bills, you go to Yelp and you list your menu with all of its deceptive caveats online so that you don't piss off future customers before you tell them they \"don't have to come back!\"",

The plates were all mediocre, and the relleno had a slightly burned taste, although it wasn't burned.  Made me think it was the oil it was fried in.  The fish taco was very good, and if I were in the area I might stop by for one of those, but that's all.",

Its made with boiled chicken chunks, not overcooked shredded  chicken left in a sauce all day  over a warmer to over cook some more.  They use a base of tortilla, beans, and cheese.  You pick the meat and adds $, burritos can be served wet(red/green sauce on top)or dry.  The adobada is amazing also, its served a bit crunchy on the ends which makes a flavorfull difference.  Even the bean and cheese burrito is awesome.  Only slight negative, if you order to go, please eat within 10 minutes, or you'll immediately see(oil and fat begins to discolor and soak tortilla) why burritos are so good!!!",

From the name, I guess I was just expecting a lot.   Location - located on a strip mall right next to a gas station and other food joints. Corner of Decatur and Sunset.  Atmosphere - the place is small but it's pretty clean and cozy. It was pretty busy when I went during lunch hour.   Food - I'm a nocturnal type of person so I always wake up late. I was craving some type of Mexican breakfast and I came across this place. I had the Chorizo breakfast burrito with a side of Barbacoa taco. Like I mentioned earlier, I thought the food was average. Prices are decent and it's something you'd expect from a place like this. I've had better ones at a local Roberto's ...   Service - no complaints on service. It's the typical order from the counter, pay and they'll being the food to you type of shindig. It was pretty prompt and the lady was quite nice.   Overall, I'd probably give this place another go. Maybe for something quick or maybe to try their famous chocolate drizzled churro. If you're looking for Mexican food or some type of Mex fusion, I'd go somewhere else...",

    "text": "After seeing the chile verde burrito from Phrank's listed in LV Weekly's Top 10 Mexican Meals, I had to try it. I happened to be in the area due to a Yelp event, so I called in a phone order and picked it up.  Shout out to their stellar customer service: the lady who took my phone order was sweet, quick, and efficient. And when I called back for their address, she gave me thorough directions, unsurprised that my GPS was coming up with errors. I really appreciated her help.  I finally got my opportunity to dive into my burrito, and it was enjoyable. The ratio of rice and beans was favorable- I prefer not to have too many in my burrito, if at all, and they were flavorful but light. The majority of the burrito was stuffed with shredded chicken, and there was a good amount of cheese, too.  As for the chile verde component of my order- well, the chicken was flavorful and had a kick to it. But it wasn't noticeably \"chile verde\", it could have quite easily passed for simply a spicy chicken burrito. This coming from a girl who regularly goes to Albuquerque and knows chile verde very well- I'm even open to interpretations, but this just didn't have the tomatillo-chile kick to it that I was expecting after the rave reviews. That's not to say it was bad, I was quite satisfied with it and felt it was priced well (about $7), but it was not the quintessential chile verde dish I was led to expect.",

I was around the area one night to gas up at the station inside that business plaza. Immediately, my eyes feasted upon the Popeyes adjacent to the gas stop, so my mind fixated on a meal there. Luckily, I decided to yelp nearby eats! & good thing I did! I read up some reviews on Phat Phrank's, and after some thoughtful reviews I stepped inside.   Frank really is a music enthusiast, I've spoken to him on it.. but music is not what this review is about!   2 Words: Fish tacos.  I've tried something different every visit (being a regular): carne asada tostada, trainer salad (recommend if you're going \"green\"), barbacoa tacos, but oh sweet fishies, their fish tacos hook you! Get it...? Hook you..? No?.. I tried.   Frank tells me that their breakfast burritos are recommended. & that's exactly what I'm getting next! I mean.. after 3 fish tacos, please! :]  P.S. We know you're thinking about opening weekends, and we all agree. Please do (even just for lunch or dinner) ! :D",

It's a family owned place where the food is made with a lot of care and I love that! \"Phrank\" is always around and smiling and his staff will do all that they can to ensure your satisfaction. At this point I've tried quite a few things... my favorites:  *Nachos - I'm actually not a nachos person, but his are done the way nachos should be! Tons of delicious shredded pork... an order is definitely a meal for 2 people! *Breakfast Burrito - the best breakfast burrito I've had in Vegas, by far! It comes with eggs, yummy crispy potatoes, cheese, and your choice of meat. He mixes everything to ensure every bite is perfect. When I'm having a bad day, I call ahead and pick one up on my way to work! *Fajitas - I have FINALLY found delicious fajitas in Vegas! I had the chicken ones for lunch today and really enjoyed them. The chicken was shredded (as opposed to the creepy pre-cut strips with faux-grill marks you find at say Chili's) and had 3 colors of peppers and onions mixed in. I'm not usually a fan of chicken, but this had an amazing amount of flavor.  *Churros - caramel and chocolate sauce.. mmmmmmm  I can also highly recommend their catering services ! \"Phrank\" helped us pick out a freaking feast for well under $10 a person. We had platters of enchiladas and tacos, guacamole, and ceviche. Everything was delicious and was ready right on time. We picked it up ourselves, but it was well packaged and transport -ready.   Overall, don't let the strip mall exterior fool you - this is Mexican (albeit heavily Americanized) at its best ! It's affordable, fast, and delicious. It's basically like  Roberto's that isn't a chain that serves food that tastes good! The only sad thing is they aren't open on weekends...",

The fresh guacamole had ample amounts of avocado and is seasoned just right.  The braised pork  (adobada) is super flavorful with a little bit of a bite.  Their hot sauce spices it up nicely.  The fish tacos were on point.  Lightly fried fish, home-made creamy sauce, and loads of fresh cabbage and green onions made the perfect combo on a soft corn tortilla.  Hubby usually doesn't like fish tacos, but he blessed these, and added an extra to his order.  We're giving this a five because you get really GOOD food and SOLID service.  I'll be back!  If I lived around here, it would be a regular lunch spot for me.  :)",

I like the place so much that I even offered to photoshop one of his signs and send it to him personally, which I did shortly after leaving. I told him to suggest a meal, and he did, so ended up ordering a couple of awesome tacos.  The 2nd time I visited wasn't so pleasant. I don't think Frank even recognized me, not to mention I didn't get my drink that I ordered. I left my order number (these things they give you when you order) on the table along with some of my belongings and went to use the bathroom. By the time I came back, my order number was gone, my food wasn't there, and I had to interrupt an order that was being taken by Frank to tell him what was going on. He got the attention of his workers and they brought my food on a tray, but I ordered it to-go. Three errors in one sitting, and I tipped extremely well straight away and left the restaurant feeling like I wanted my tip back. Probably won't be going back to Phat Phranks again after this trip.

I stopped here for lunch last week only because I happen to be in the Sunset and Decatur area and the listing had some good reviews from people I actually know.  Well, I don't trust any of you anymore...OK I'm kidding, sort of.  Selection:  \"Steak\" Burrito upgraded to \"wet\" with red sauce.  I was not a fan of this offering due to the fact that the \"steak\" was more like ground beef, the burrito was barely warm (bordering on room temperature) and the red sauce was essentially watered down ketchup and had no kick to it whatsoever.  Overall the meal was a disappointment.  I'm not sure how a burrito that is made on the spot is sent out room temperature but that's what I got.  Phact:  I won't be back.",

Super uninterested and stand-offish service, wobbly broken table and beyond mediocre food - I was thoroughly not amused here.  The deal-breaker for me were the fish tacos - if you're going to charge a premium price per taco ($4.39), it should be hooked up with decent flavor and quality? Nope. The fish itself was a decent portion size, but the breading was identical to the fish sticks from the freezer aisle - pretty weak. The \"Cabbage Tuesday\" as yelper Ardie Y. comically and accurately puts it - was over done in abundance and upon inspecting the the bits of scallion and cilantro mixed in, it was browning and drying out. Not to mention, the \"special\" sauce was lacking much flavor. The overall tacos were a huge disappointment; I would prefer a Rubio's fish taco over these and they are also a far better price for what you get!   I also sampled the Huevos rancheros for $7 and semi-stale, boring chips but with a generous amount of guacamole for $5 - I would also rate both dishes as average. Nothing to see here folks. Here's the worst part - quickly after my last bites, I immediately felt a pain in my stomach. Was the salsa too spicy? Not to my chili eating tastebuds it wasn't. (Shrug)  In all honesty, the vibe of the whole place threw me for a loop. I was hoping for down to earth, welcoming and eager service with a memorable, flavorful lunch, but all I ended up getting was a stomach ache and looking forward to getting the heck out of there real quick.",

I ended up here because it was bookmarked and because the other place I was going to try didn't open until 7 either and I wasn't going to wait there that long.  See it was an early flight.  When the doors were unlocked, I went in and had my choice of where to sit.  It's not a large place.  The server brought my menu and after some thought, I got the Huevos Divorciados, divorced eggs.  It comes with potatoes, refried beans, and tortillas.  The divorced of the eggs is one red and one green.  The green is topped by some good chile verde and the red is gotten from a red sauce that has a bit of a kick.  On the wall on the west side of the room is an area where they have the plastic ware you dispense for yourself and there are napkins there, too.  The breakfast was good but the plate was detracted by how poorly it looked on arrival.  The potato slices run on to the eggs which run onto the beans.  It tasted better than it looked.  Perhaps less runny beans or a plate with compartments?  Service was OK after a little bit of a shaky start.  I had to wait for the coffee but that was OK.  They just opened and they were brewing a fresh pot.  A good place to stop but I think it would be a better lunch stop than breakfast!",

I looked at their website in advance which has the menu as was very disappointed that the prices were vastly different and they told me that prices are subject to change.  I got what the cashier recommended which was the best seller, the chili verde burrito.  Also disappointed they charge $0.25 for water.  Burrito and a water was $10.25.   They appeared to be a popular location and the seating was full and the lines were fast.   The kitchen is viewable from the eating area and I would have preferred not to see where the magic happens.   Wasn't the best looking or operating kitchen I have seen.  Tapatio was on the table for use.  Parking was limited to a few spaces out front.  The burrito was large and served on plastic. It was incredibly salty and almost difficult to eat. Burrito places are a dime a dozen in Vegas and I'll probably be going elsewhere.",

The burrito with carne asada filling and the special pork sauce on top was good.  The pork was amazing, but the burrito itself was just OK.  Not bad, but I thought the flour tortilla got kind of soggy under the sauce.  Maybe I am just not a burrito fan.  I recommend the tacos, though I might ask them to hold the cabbage next time.",

Any moron can open a restraint and resell Sysco boxed crap and make a go of it, but this place is on a whole different level. Frank, his wife, daughter, grand sons, and other family members make nearly all the food items fresh. You always hear someone say that \"this is the best whatever it is they are eating\", but at Phat Phranks you really want to say it about everything you put in your mouth. They are open till 6 PM on every night but Thursday.  Go there on a Thursday night after 6 PM and see what the car clubs bring to his special late hours event.  Be sure to try the Churro.",

    "text": "I am a phan of Phat Phrank's. Sorry--couldn't resist!   I have been hearing about this place for a few months now and decided to give it a try thanks to my fellow yelpers. What I liked most about it was that it was different from the norm. For example, it is not a traditional sit down restaurant nor is it your average taqueria. There are a handful of tables and chairs that we were able to move around to accommodate our party of 4. However, the best thing about this place was the friendly environment Phrank creates in his restaurant. He is welcoming, and constantly checks on you to make sure your visit is going smoothly. I like that!  As far as the food in concerned, it was pretty good for the most part. My wife and I decided to share a variety of dishes, so we could sample the different flavors that were on the menu. We started off with the nachos, which came loaded with tender Chile Verde and cheese over the top of crispy tortilla chips. Good, but I forgot that I don't like cheese with pork. Something weird happens when the cheese mixes with the sauce from the meat. The result is a gelatin mixture of wet, sloppy, cheesy goo. Next time - no cheese please.   We also tried the carne asada burrito with rice inside. Tasty, but I had better versions in town -Los Tacos for example. The fish tacos I kept hearing so much about were \"fishy\", and disappointing. But hey- we are in Las Vegas! How fresh can the fish be? The star of the meal was the adobada taco that was seasoned well and went perfectly with the cabbage and hot sauce. Next time, I would order a handful of those and be just fine.   Prices are reasonable, as we spent 23.00 for all that food and a large soft drink. We will be back to visit Phrank and support his restaurant that he obviously cares so much about.",

The burrito was filled with seasoned tender meat, eggs, and potatoes. It had a good flavor to it but I'm super sensitive when it comes to salt ...it was a bit on the salty side for me. My husband loved his burrito he liked the fact that the meat was not hard and there where no pieces of fat in it. The service was outstanding you can tell Frank has a lot of heart and he put it in this place. Our cups never went empty and the service was very attentive. I would love to come back and sample some of their dishes that have chicken in it because I hear it's pretty \" Phantastic\"!",

We pulled up, hopped out and started to peruse the offerings of each establishment when a young guy walked out of Phrank's and advised us: \"The food here is phantastic.\" Well, maybe he said, \"fantastic.\" Anyways, we were sold!  The interior is simple. Apparently, they're working on a music theme and accepting donations to deck the walls. We took notice of two violins hanging over the counter. We assumed Phrank was a virtuoso of sorts, but our vision was squashed when the lady behind the counter told us they were simply donated by customers.   Speaking of the lady behind the counter--she was a complete sweetheart! She was enthusiastic, helpful and sincere. I was curious about the tea selections, so she provided me with a sample. It was too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the taste.  She recommended the Trainer Salad, and I had been eyeing it already, so my decision was easy.  The Trainer was a tasty, refreshing lunch. I loved the cabbage and cilantro additions. I also chowed down on the big, tender chunks of white meat chicken. Too often at a Mexican restaurant the chicken quality is, well, dicey, but Phrank does chicken right. They serve the salad with fresh salsas as dressing, and I happily dumped a healthy dose of the tomatillo offering on top. I must say that was a strong call on my part. Of course, it helped that the salsa was tangy and delicious. The salad also came with guac and beans, and both were equally yumalicious. My husband had some tacos, and I can report that there is a lotta of meat in those tortillas. Be careful or you might just end up phat yourself!",

On top of that, the \"carne asada\" burrito is 75% rice and beans, and what meat is there is meh at best. I am totally cool with mistakes, they happen, but have decent enough customer service to just eat the dollar and fix what you should have done and charged in the first place. Honestly, even with that it probably wouldn't have been much better. With Robertos right up the street I have no need to go back, and you should go elsewhere as well.",

I paid $9.00 and change for the carnitas plate and there was less then half an ounce of pork. Literally way more lettuce then meat. I don't eat a lot of food normally but this was a little ridiculous. I am so frustrated because it was so so so delicious. I don't usually even eat rice and beans but I tried them cuz I was so hungry and they were very good. So kinda sad it was so good but I wish there was at least an amount that would fill up a small child. I should of taken a picture but had to get back to work. Like I said food tasted really good but the amount was so small",

    "text": "Had Phat Franks for the first time just a few hours ago. Very impressed with the food and Frank.   He and his helper (didn't catch her name) are very cordial and really make an effort to offer exceptional service.   Ordered one carnitas and two chicken tacos. They were phenomenal! I love tacos and try to sample as many as possible. Frank does a great job. The meat is flavorful, moist and plentiful, the corn tortillas fresh and the toppings are near salad like proportions (cabbage, cilantro and onion). I opted for the spicy salsa (there is a mild, green and spicy) which had a nice kick to it. There is no salsa bar, your choice is added to the order.   The price, as I recall, is about $2.89 per taco. A little on the higher side, but they are worth it as the overall size and meat portion trumps the other tacos I've come across.  The place is also very clean and the food is made to order and prepared quickly.         Phat Frank's is simply PHantastic!",

It isn't trying to be authentic Mexican food by any means, and if that is what you are looking for there are better options.  If you are looking for Mexican style food that tastes good, at a reasonable price this should do it for you. There is no Waiter service, but it doesn't quite feel like fast food (beyond the ordering process).   The staff is friendly and they appear to be treated well.",

The torta was great, and the bread was nice and toasty as mentioned many times here. The meat was very tender, and the green secret sauce oozed out the bottom. Only thing missing was some avocado.  The Burrito also had very tender meat, and the tortilla was the chewy kind that I love. It was a bit on the greasy side though (lots of cheese), and I wish it had some kind of texture contrast such as some crunch of lettuce or something. (Just beginning to think I'm not that into burritos.)  He offers three types of salsas. I think at least one should be more hot though. Like I said, Phrank is a hard working guy and really takes pride in his restaurant. He takes out the issue of LV Weekly that he was featured in a few months back and shows it to pretty much everyone that comes in. If I got in the Weekly I would too! :)  Other popular dishes that I will try next time include the chile verde burrito (featured in the Weekly) and the fish tacos.  FYI, they are located in the small plaza behind the Am/Pm. Turn in like you're going to Am/Pm and you'll see them there. It's a little hard to see the signage from the street until after you pass it.",

I guess I was expecting more because most of the reviews I've seen suggested that the food is full of flavor... it wasn't. I also had the churros everyone raves about... Very underwhelmed....

We got the adobada torta and the fish tacos, both were so delicious that I could sit there and eat them all day. Both had such great flavors and every sauce (we tried them all) was awesome. The best part was, after we ate (way more than we should've) I didn't feel overfull or fat like I do after most of my Mexican food meals :) The ingredients were all super fresh and light. I will most definitely be back with friends. I only wish I had one closer to my house so that I could take my husband back for dinner tonight! I'll have to bring him soon! Thank you to everyone. I will most definitely be a phattie :)",

I wish they had a bigger place but they are still in this small location. There is a small frame sign behind the register for \"El Tepeyac\" which is a long established restaurant in East Los Angeles and maybe the best Mexican restaurant in America. The food at Phat Franks reminds me a great deal of El Tepeyac. I can think of no greater endorsement I can give. The Chilean Verde burrito is the best I have ever had and because it is so great I won't try anything else. Family members have tried other items and rave about them. My son-in-law had a Carne Asada burrito during our last visit and loved it. I worked in East Los Angeles and became a connoisseur of Mexican food. I have found very few places in Vegas that are really good, but Phat Franks is great. Again, don't expect a fancy place. It is hidden in a little strip mall so it isn't easy to find. If you try it you will be hooked. I just wish they would move to a bigger location and move closer to my house so I don't have to drive ten miles to get there. But, it is worth the drive.",

The rest of the staff was super friendly and you can tell a lot of love is poured into this food. We were there celebrating a birthday so the owner brought out a dessert he called a Chimicheescake that was soooo good. A flaky shell filled with warm cream cheese drizzled with cinnamon sugar and honey. I will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "I actually had received an email from Yelp yesterday with Phat Phrank's highlighted in it and so thought I would try it out for the first time since the ratings were so good.  Somewhat disappointed.....I don't think it is a 4.5 star rating, but if I was in the neighborhood and was hungry for Mexican Food I would stop. Certainly not worth a trip of about 6 miles from my home.  I ordered a chicken burrito.  Thought I would compare it to the chicken burrito I had the previous day at \"Roberto's Tacos.\"  It was good, but not fabulous.  I had asked if they put cheese on their chicken burritos and I was told yes, but after eating the whole thing, I hadn't seen a sign of any cheese.  They do add rice and beans, which to me then makes it a combination burrito and I wanted chicken.  The chicken was all white meat, but not enough chicken for me and to much rice and beans.  It was bland tasting without adding any salsa or hot sauce.  The portion size was good, and the salsa was good, but would have tasted better on chips rather than the burrito.  The chicken burrito I had eaten at the \"Roberto's\" the day before was all chicken, no rice and beans and very tasty.  It was seasoned with some chiles and peppers and very good to eat without adding anything to it if you didn't want to.  Roberto's was definitely better when it came to the chicken burrito.  Phat Phrank's does not have a menu board and so you have to wait until you get up to the counter to look at the one menu they had available to order off of.  It didn't give you much time to make up your mind when there were people waiting in line behind you.  The employees were all very friendly and the facility was clean.  I will probably go back and try some other items, but not at the top of my list to run right back tomorrow.",

First, Frank greets you as if he just saw you yesterday and has known you for years.  He is so friendly, and funny, and welcoming.  As we told him at the end of our meal... we felt as though we were dinner guests in his home.  The food was just great!  We were both really hungry because we had been too sick to eat for days.

So, I was expecting just an average Mexican joint and play it safe with a couple of a la cart tacos.  It was early in the lunch hour, so it looked a little quiet from the outside. As soon as I walked through the door, I was greeted by the entire staff! Nice! With this being my first visit, the friendly gentlemen behind the counter (who I connect the dots as Phrank) was quick to suggest some of their best dishes. I notice out of the corner of my eye a sign advertising their daily special as fish tacos with rice and beans. Done and done.   I have a seat and in no time one of their servers brings me out my drink and asks me if this was my first visit. \"We hope you enjoy the food!\" he says mentions that my lunch will be right out.   Meanwhile, the place is really starting to pick up! Construction workers, business men and a couple of families all seem to be regulars and strike up conversations with Phrank and even recognize each other as loyal fans of the food.  The fish tacos were incredible!  Good portion size and yummy, well seasoned rice (although still not as good as my mom's)!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I was in and out of there in no time, but it was probably a good thing as people were literally lined up for the next available table.  All in all, great experience, good food, terrific staff and close enough to the office it's a shame not to visit at least a few times a month.",

I had the asada tacos and they were good but a bit dry, my husband had the pork torta special (I could have the name totally wrong) and he said it was the absolute best he has ever had. I am disappointed because I ordered (and paid for) the beans and rice for both meals and never got them. I didn't realize it until after we left (my own fault) because I had two kids keeping my attention during the meal. I will be back and I hope to be able to update with a better review next time. The food and service was great I knocked the rating down because I didn't get all of the food I paid for and my asada tacos were a bit dry.",

I order and give him my debit card, he comments on my name, and from then on when he addressed me he called me by my name, I mean how nice is that? I ordered the trainer salad ( I really really really wanted the nachos, but summer is coming) when it was placed in front of me, it was different than what I expected, everything was separated, didn't look like a salad, oh well, my fault for not reading the menu. The hot sauce and the tomatillo sauce had decent flavor, but the more chicken I ate, I kept drinking more and more water. I found it to be very salty. My lips started getting that feeling when all your water in your body is being depleted. I'm sorry, wasn't a phan of the salad Phrank. I may return to try the fish tacos.",

I'm so glad I placed my phone order before I checked the cross streets, because I probably wouldn't have ordered it since I was coming from Fort Apache and Flamingo, but it only took a few minutes on the 215 to get there! And Phat Phrank's certainly exceeded my expectations! My husband and I ordered three burritos to share with our three kids (1, 3 & 6 years old) and the five of us couldn't finish them! My favorite was the Chile Verde (with green sauce, of course) and my husband's was the Barbacoa! We also got the Carne Asada with red sauce, which was very good, but I definitely prefer the green sauce. Oh! And we got an order of chips and salsa, also delicious! The salsa is very fresh and flavorful (we tried all three: hot, mild and green) and the chips are perfect! And the staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person! We'll absolutely be back!",

I came to Las Vegas as a vacation for my birthday. While on the West Coast, I was definitely in the mood for a breakfast burrito. Found this place via Yelp and decided to try it out. I had the chicken, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito, with mild salsa and a side of fries. The chicken was flavored nicely but was a bit on the salty side.  Of the 3 women running the place at the time, only one was pleasant. The lady at the cash register acted as if it was an issue just for us to finalize what our order would be.  She was not very helpful in providing feedback on the menu when asked, and her tone of voice was not what you would think someone would give in a service based establishment. When asked for ketchup, I was directed to go get my own packets at the front of the restaurant. No napkins, no silverware.  It wasn't a horrible experience, but wasn't very welcoming either, which was a bit of a surprise being in a place that thrives off of tourism.",

Even if the food was a 4, would still give a 5 star review because the service puts them over the top. It was the first visit for the kids and I but my husband used to to go often when he worked nearby, 9 years ago. The owner, Phrank, remembered him. 9 years! Everyone was so friendly and quick to accommodate. The place is small, so it gets packed at lunch but we found seating for 5 since the tables turn over pretty quickly. Phrank said they're going to start opening on Saturdays. So give them a try on a Saturday when the work lunch crowd isn't so big.",

My wife and I went here for lunch and noticed there were no menus. I had to stand in a line of 4 people just to get a menu since there was only one person at the front. Once I got the menu, we skimmed over it...Nothing really special caught our eyes so we ordered the carne asada fries and chicken soft tacos. The food took about 25 minutes to come out which I felt was too long. The lady next to me was upset because she ordered her food to go and they brought it out to her on a plate. When our food was brought to us I noticed all they had were cheap plastic forks to eat with, which I'm fine with if I was expecting to eat at a Robertos. The fries were very basic, nothing special at all. The chicken soft tacos literally ripped apart once I picked it up. The only good thing about this was the chicken. I could tell it was actual shredded chicken breast. All in all, if I wanted to eat at Robertos or faustos...I would eat at Robertos or faustos...not drive across town for this. I honestly don't see where the 4&1/2 stars came from.",

They even have a healthy option which is usually a problem if you want Mexican food. \"The Trainers Salad\" is delicious for how good it is for you.   The fish tacos are to die for! I could go on and on but I must mention the ground beef \"gringo style\" tacos. Get them, that is all I have time for but everything there us delicious and it's all homemade and everyone is always friendly.   Go there and thank me later.",

    "text": "At first thought Phat Phranks sounds like a hot dog joint but after you walk in it takes a left turn to Mexico!  Known for the Adobada Torta, I had to try it out.  I've had quite a few tortas in my time so i was expecting the usual with maybe a twist on the meat.  Y hole! Upon arrival, something is different here.  My bun is flattened and grilled, did somebody step on my samich?  Nope, this is part of what makes the difference of a great torta.  Some torta buns or bollilos  can be a bit fluffy so when eating you get a bit high ratio of bun to meat.  By flattening the torta, you get a more even playing field of meat, veggies n flavors.  Upon first bite, there's is a delicious mix of tasty, crunchity pork, cabbage, lettuce, cilantro, tomatoe, secret sauce and green onions give a lil flavor kick!    Choice of salsas: Mild-your standard mild mannered mix Hot-feisty n smokey with a blend of chili de arbol (type of chili used by real Mexicans)  Green-tangy mix of chilies, cilantro, onions, I'm green with envy!   I told Frank, Phrank? That this is one of the best tortas ever!  I'm not eating another torta in vegas ever again... He laughed, which seems to be his character, a jolly phellow who talks to all the patrons.  Go Raiders?  Based on the execution of the torta, I'd say they have a great venue here... Mexican food with a notch up level of creativity! Say goodbye ol Robert-O....  I'm looking forward to sampling some other delicacies soon.   Delicioso!",

I saw all the good reviews on Yelp so we decided to try it Plus I looooove Mexican food! I ordered the fish tacos and let me say they were the BOMB!!! They give you a Big piece of fish. It was crunchy but not overbreaded. You can tell it was homemade and not just out of a bag. The beans and rice were flavorful and the secret sauce was so good! My husband had the carne asada torta and he enjoyed every minute of it. Phat Phranks is great!",

I literally tore off between the two enough tortillas to make 2 big tacos. The potatoes inside the burritos were way over cooked, I would say burnt. I might try this place again but only because the owner was nice. The guacamole also had too much garlic and salt l, a little less and I wouldn't of even mentioned it.  For food I would recommend Don Tortaco if you want a breakfast burrito.  The hot salsa was delicious though and the chorizo was also perfect minus the tortillas and potato issues.",

I was sooo on the fence about getting a breakfast burrito based on Blair B's terrific review and since it was my first meal of the day.  In the end, I went with the carne asada and a couple of carnita tacos.  The carne asada was pretty good but the pork carnitas blew my mind.  Maybe it was due to my hangover that day I was ready to drive back and have a couple of more.  The pork was so juicy and well seasoned that, like a good movie, I didn't want it to end.    Phrank took my order and as everyone else mentions in their reviews was very hospitable.  He was also patient as I was the only one in the restaurant at the time looking at the menu for a while.  So many other things on the menu to try!  I would definitely frequent this place more if not for their hours but that's just the nature of their location.  I will be back for sure.",

I didn't even know that Decatur and Sunset existed until I a lunch meeting one day.  I kind of thought it was...just desert.  The menu is pretty simple, as you pick your meat, and then you can have it on a plate with rice and beans, or in a burrito with all the guts nicely wrapped together.  I ordered a carnitas burrito and a drink.  The burrito itself was well made, but the taste was bland.  This may seem strange (especially with the health food nuts), but I thought the burrito was TOO dry because of the lack of oil and grease.  I guess you could compare it to a burger that's too lean; you gotta have some fat in a burger, and you gotta have some grease in Mexican food.  Can't fault the service, though; food came out fast and they came by checking on refills at least 3 times.  That, and we loitered for about 45 minutes after eating, and they seemed to have no problem with it.  For now, this place gets a solid 3 from me.  Maybe if I revisit, I will get a new combo in my burrito and see how that comes out.",

Looking around, there were many regulars that Phrank knew by their first name. Overall, we had a wonderful lunch and will be back again to support Phrank and his family business. Phrank also asked us for our first names, which I found to be very gracious. Phat Phrank's rocks!!!",

My coworker and I went for lunch yesterday and I am so glad we tried it.  Frank actually was the one who took our order.  My coworker and I are in Sales which means we are NOT shy people and love to talk so we asked Frank \"What's the most popular items?\"  He gave us a few things that are the biggest sellers and elected to finally choose a green burrito with some of the most flavorful pork ever.  As we were eating Frank came out and brought us a sample of his barbacoa.  OMG, off the hook.  We get to chatting and Frank asks where I am from to which I say \"San Diego\".  He then proceeds to tell me that the fish tacos are out of this world.  Crap, should I have ordered that?  (as I continue to devoure the best frigging burrioto I have had in town since moving back here.).  Ok, no worries, next trip its fish tacos.   All I can say is that I am not going anywhere else for Mexican.  This place rocks the house.  Robertos, Albertos, Don Juan DeMarco or whoever, has nothing on Phat Franks.  And to top it off, the prices for food are great.  I am so happy that it is a quick trip from the office for lunch.   THANK YOU Frank!  You are awesome and your food is equal to your hospitality.",

    "text": "Executive summary:  We stayed in Vegas for 12 days; we ate at Phrank's four times.  There's Mexican food that's good for a hangover.  There's Mexican food that's good for kids.  Then, there's Phrank's.  Phrank is a humble man, and he claims that it's tough for him to put his finger on what makes his family's place so awesome.  I'll try to lay it out for you:  1.  The meat is unbelievably well prepared.  The carnitas are the perfect mix of seasoned tender goodness with that bit of crispiness on the top.  The chicken was moist, plump, perfectly seasoned, and changed our lives.  If giving up all my worldly possessions would result in my being able to eat the barbacoa every day, I would seriously consider it.  2.  The menu is not the typical hundred item monster that you find at your standard taqueria.  Phrank and Phamily know what they're good at, and they stick to it.  3.  Service, service, service.  This family knows how to keep customers happy.",

    "text": "Phat Phranks is a short drive from my house and have been meaning to try it for some time now. The  6am to 6pm hours made it very difficult for me to eat there. They really should change to 8a-8pm at the very least so people could try it out after work. I am not a good morning person so chances were slim me trying to before work and after work it is closed already. I am so glad I finally go to test out Phat Phranks. It is right off the 215 and decatur.   I had the breakfast burrtio with egg and cheese and a bean and cheese tostada. The breakfast burrito was excellent. The only one better in town is at Nordstrom Cafe but for the price and the flavors packed into it, this is a solid #2. The Tostada was good but nothing too special. The food gets 4 stars. Frank  was the one taking the order and ringing you up. The family is the ones cooking and serving and they were very friendly, attentive and you get the feeling you are in their home and not in their place of business. There are so many businesses in Las Vegas that need to take a lesson from Phat Phrank's and learn what real service is. So with good food and service as good as good as it gets, not to mention an indy family owned place Phrank's easily get's 5 stars in my book. Support it and do it regularly because places like this need our support to survive. They are a rarity in Las Vegas and I will be doing my part supporting Phrank so I have options other than chains to go to.",

I cannot wait to go back and order that!  If you are a fan of churros, they make amazing ones! They drizzle chocolate and caramel over them, making them better than any amusement park's!

While having an overstuffed burrito isn't for the lite eaters (they have fish tacos, salad and shrimp fajitas for you) the burritos are more than a mouthful.  Easily missed is the nachos, but don't skip them.  They are simple, but loaded and a meal all by themselves.  Everything is made to order and fresh - no fast food here just fast service with a smile.  Frank makes the place welcoming to all who enter and he makes sure you leave full.  I hear he even makes a great burger (the Ph. D burger)... I am sure I will have one soon.  You don't have to count your pennies to eat here either... probably the most affordable place in town and you will always get more than your monies worth.  Go for breakfast... where else can you get a 15 cent cup of coffee with 2 refills now a days and he opens the doors at 4am for you early risers or late night workers - now I just need to convince him to open on Sundays!",

A lady, who I'm assuming was Mrs. Phrank, cooked and then delivered our phood to our table, which was a nice touch. My tostada was double-layered with the refried beans being between the two tostada shells and the rest of the toppings on top. The carne asada was tender and tasty, and the serving was just enough to make a meal of. My husband's nachos were piled high with chile verde which tasted like it had been marinating and cooking for hours - like something they would serve at their own table at home. Phrank came out a little while later to see how we were doing and to deliver samples of the beef barbacoa, which was also top-notch. Phrank (who is a bit of a jokester) asked our names and shook our hands as we were leaving. Excellent phood, great prices and REALLY nice people. I phoresee becoming a regular in my phuture!!",

I tried the carne asada breakfast burrito and I have to say I really like how they cooked the breakfast potatoes in the burrito, definitely a nice change of pace. The carne asada meat was seasoned to perfection and tasted like most fresh carne asada meats. The tortilla wasn't as good as Fausto's but the breakfast filling inside could give any any Fausto's/Robertos burrito a run for their money if not better.           My only complaint with this place is that I have actually been here several times only to realize they were closed. They're only open from 6am-6pm, which means its never open for dinnertime, or at least my dinnertime. 2nd they're not open weekends which is primetime burrito hour. That means no love from Phat Frank's on picnic Saturdays or hangover Sundays for some people. Ah well, all in all a good place.",

    "text": "Meeting new yelp friends is a great way of finding out about new places to eat. A friend came back to town, from Reno, to prep for his wedding and had some time to kill. He asked for Mexican food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try this place out.  After a few days of eating poorly; I was in much need of a salad, but still wanted to try something more traditional, and got a taco as well. The trainer's salad contained huge, moist chunks of white chicken breast. The two generous scoops of guacamole, a mound of cabbage, cilantro, and beans makes for a filling meal. The green salsa dressing was not too flavorful, but the pile of limes can fix that. The carnitas taco was the size of two tacos. It was like a mini salad to accompany my entree. The hot red salsa did not deliver. The thing about Pat Phrank's is that it is not your typical Mexican joint. It is not super greasy and is not overly seasoned. My two friends got burritos and they both were unimpressed. The lack of contrasting textures and temperatures does not help. Each burrito comes with your choice of meat, then beans and rice. All of the ingredients are hot and soft, the addition of guac, sour cream, or lettuce would give it the additional omph.   The service is the main reason this place gets four stars. The staff are stellar. The food comes out fast and they are attentive. During our meal, we had someone checking up on us for refills and if we needed anything more. After we finished we lingered around for 45 minutes and no one made us feel uncomfortable or rushed us out.",

I had my first brain surgery on July 10 and lost my sense of taste and smell from the traumatic brain injury and subsequent infection. When I was released from the hospital the second time we visited your establishment s few times as I tried to resume a \"normal\" life but nothing has really tasted like much for the last two months. I've been able to taste \"sweet\" and \"salt\" when there are chemicals like msg involved but food and drinks have basically tasted no better than dirt. I had another surgery last Thursday, this time to remove the infected piece of skull and clean out the YUCK from my brain. Friday morning I had black coffee and for the first time I could taste food again and that coffee was fantastic. I stayed in that hospital until yesterday morning and the normally bland hospital food was wonderful. The only thing I could think to do when leaving the hospital yesterday was to visit PHAT Phranks and test out my new taste buds but unfortunately time prevented that from occurring. Today I waited patiently until we could visit and I just finished my first green Chile smothered burrito. OH MY GOD!  I WANT TO CRY :) THANK YOU SO MUCH! It was a long two months without taste buds. I still can't smell anything- that may be a few months or never until that comes back but there were indications early today that it's returning slowly. THE BEST THING I'VE PUT IN MY MOUTH ON OVER TWO MONTHS!  I can't come back on the same schedule I once visited you guys but I will definitely be looking forward to my next visit. You guys are always so nice to me and my family and the food is delicious. Thank you again. I even think the twelve year old decided today he loved that green Chile burrito which is saying a lot considering he usually thinks ketchup is too spicy :)",

    "text": "Las Vegas is overrun with celebrity chefs -- Bobby Flay, Joel Robuchon, and Jose Andres all come to mind -- but my favorite Las Vegas chef these days is Frank Miranda, of Phat Phrank's fame (phame?).  Frank is running one of the best hidden spots in town.  I'd been there once before, but I recently visited again to try Frank's famous ceviche.  And it was just as outstanding as I'd been told.  I don't know how he finds such fresh fish in the middle of the desert.  Clearly Frank is a miracle worker.  The other highlight was tasting Frank's chimi cheesecake.  A tortilla stuffed with cream cheese, deep-fried, and then coated with generous cinnamon sugar and caramel?  Um, yes please!  Frank's little restaurant is a total gem.  So here's my tip to Californians driving up the northbound 15 to kick off a Vegas  weekend: A couple miles before you reach the Strip, make a little detour onto the westbound 215, and drive one exit to Decatur Blvd.  Phat Phrank's will be right there, waiting to fill your belly with delicious Mexican-American fare that's made with love.  (It's cheap too, leaving that many more benjamins in your wallet available for squandering at the casino.)",

    "text": "Ok this is my 3rd and final review and what was once 4 stars is now 1. I love this places food but after today I'm done trying to support your business. I came in today 12/15 to order 1 plate and the lady tells me I'm sorry i just want you to know your order won't be ready for at least 30 minutes, we have a big catering order and our grill is full. Wow, so you filled up your entire grill and didn't allow for walk in customers to come in and be served in a decent timely manner. The place was empty. I purposely came at 2:30 because you guys are slowed down by then after lunch rush. I seriously liked your food enough to keep coming back despite your lack of hours, and then this. Good luck, I'm sure I'm not the only disappointed customer.   UPDATED REVIEW: I've never seen a restaurant only open Monday through Friday. First you were closed on Sundays, now on Saturdays. As popular as you are, you should not be closed on a Saturday. Disappointed customer   Finally got to try this place out. Price is RIGHT!! Food is great and horchata is so good. By no means is this authentic Mexican food, but it is yummy and that's all that matters. Even my 4 year old stuffed herself! Customer service is great and the restaurant was well kept. I will definitely be back time and time again.",

I had the Barbacoa Breakfast Burrito with the green salsa....my god they slice the potatoes and the egg, the cheese, with the slow roasted barbacoa and the garlicy, citrus, hint of spice green sauce topping it off makes this shit soooo good.

However, I was taken aback with the cleanliness and atmosphere of the restaurant. The menus looked so dirty and disgusting that it was  gross to touch them.  The atmosphere was boring and the chairs were uncomfortable. The quality of the service was very average and unmemorable.   Our meals were nicely presentable and looked appealing. The problem is that the food did not taste very fresh. I ordered a torta Adovada and the pork was crunchy and over cooked. It felt like the pork has been cooked for a long time and reheated. We had the same issue with our burrito. The tortilla was so soggy that it was hard to enjoy.  I can see why some people like it as their salsas are good and give the food a good taste. However, the overall experience was more disappointing than agreeable.",

The food was excellent -- nothin fancy, just basic good Mexican food.  I like enchiladas and I was pleased that I could order one or two or three enchiladas on the plate.  Basically you create your own platter.  I liked the refried beans (not an upscale recipe, just delicious and just the way I like). My wife had carnitas and she was happy.  Highly recommended.",

The service was excellent, the food arrived quickly, and everything was delicious. We enjoyed the food and the service so well that we would have come back for breakfast, but it would have taken 20+ minutes and I needed to be somewhere at 8am.

It's not a free for all where grubby people with their grubby hands are fondeling the utensils.   CLEAN tables await you.   Food is FRESH...you can taste the difference...and made to order. Not greasy. No \"fat only\" steak burritos here. Chicken burritos are made from the breast, not from various chicken parts lying around. Green sauce has bits of pork in it.   The owner & all the staff are friendly. Your order is brought to your table once ready whether its dine in or take away.  Prices are reasonable.   Different clientele frequents this hidden gem at Sunset & Decatur doors down from the AMPM & Cafe Berlin. If you're sick of nasty Mexican food from these other joints, try this place.

The lady at the counter just kinda looked at me instead of greeting. Then barely holds her hand out to return my card, I had to lean over the entire counter to get it back. I say thank you, she says nothing at all.  Pork carnitas plate. It was decent, kinda small. Took 25 minutes to come out. 25 minutes. Horrible.  When they deliver your food, they don't say anything. Just drop it off. You then have to get up, find your way to the fork and napkin dispensers and get your own stuff.  All in all, the food was okay, but I won't be back. Way too many inconveniences and lack of pleasant service attitude",

    "text": "Came back quite a few times after writing my last review and I haven't been beyond satisfied every single time. My boyfriend and I come here whenever we are on this side of town and we always get extra salsa to take home. He usually get the carne Asada burrito. I usually get the taco combo either carnitas or carne Asada. Always delicious. Going to venture out and try the chile verde burrito next time since it is what they are known for! Customer service is always great, the girls always joke around with me because of the smell I bring in from work (similar to something you might smell a few doors down) I smell amazing. Can't wait to go back to the south side of town to come here again. Yummm!",

    "text": "So I've been to Phat Phrank's a couple times over the last year. Admittedly, my first time there I wasn't totally blown away. Don't get me wrong - I did think the food was fantastic, but I distinctly remember thinking it was an easy 4* place, but not really deserving of the big 5*.  Somehow, though, every time I've visited since - no matter how little time has passed since my last trip there - I take my first bite and always wind up thinking to myself, \"wow, this is even better than I remembered\". I don't know how they do it, whether it's the fresh ingredients, top notch execution, or the little touches they add to the preparation that just give the food here that wonderful delightfulness that foodies always seek.  So yeah, the tortas (either adobado or carnitas, depending on my mood) have basically reached comfort food status in my book. Order some beans, rice, and sour cream add-ons as supplements, and life is very good when I visit Phat Phrank's.",

He was working the register and really wanted to serve clients right.   We talked a bit about Wahoos, his goal of having a restaurant in every state, not selling out (but that's okay... ), wanting to be private like In-N-Out..... anyhow about the food  I had the CARNITAS TORTA.   It was very well executed.   One of the best mexican-american tortas that I've ever had.    Loved that they used fresh ingredients like first generation mexican but tasted americanized in a very good way.   Reminds me to an mexican version of Jack Urban Eats (Sacramento) and a similar quality to Guisados (East LA).",

Phrank took the took the time taking orders personally and even came out to the dinning area and made sure everyone was happy! Now that's service.   After placing my order with Phrank at the counter my food arrived within minutes is seemed like. I saw good reviews for the fish tacos and went with the fish taco combo plate. Tacos were yummy, sizable pieces of deep fried fish with cabbage and a light white sauce. I added some salsa which gave my tacos a nice kick. The beans and rice were also good.   Phat Phank's has been here two years and it's nice to see a non big box place chain do well. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the tacos and burritos - prices are reasonable and service is great.",

Had the Carne Asada burrito and it was hands down the best quick-serve type burrito I've had in time that I can remember. The Carne Asada was amongst the best (if not the best!) I've ever had, and the beans and cheese supplemented wonderfully. I tried their hottest salsa, it was delicious with just the right amount of heat. The burrito was comparable in size to a Chipotle burrito, but much better. The building itself is a smaller, diner type place. If you happen to be in this part of Vegas, I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Very convenient and the price is right.",

I mean really? Another price increase? If making this burrito cost that much I feel you are doing something wrong. I have literally been coming to this place from they day they opened their doors. Sadly unless I win powerball.... my blue collar self will have to eat somewhere else.   Love the Food, No where worth the price they are charging for specific items. Lunch is a better value I guess.   Update!!!! I got a better Job and can now afford the best breakfast burrito in town without feeling broke after eating it!   Phat Phranks is, and will still be my go to for breakfast!  ( The Tortas are amazing too!)",

Since it was my first time in, i would start off with a carne asada burrito and test the waters. The guacamole was so cold, that it cooled the whole burrito! I can forgive that usually. But the meat. The meat looked like it was being held in a too hot steam table for most of the day. It was 2 pm when I walked in. It had Too much gristle, and looked like it's bought pre cubed. The meat looked like over cooked ground beef.  In short, at least for this visit... I would have to say a poor attempt at Robertos. And Robertos is , well, you know!  I gave it a 2 star, because phat frank was polite and welcoming. Sorry frank , will not be coming back in.",

Their sign at restaurant says open until 7pm but everything online says 9pm. Now we're off find something else, so disappointed.   After getting a message back this morning from the restaurant, claiming they were in fact open, it will not allow me to reply back. The door we're locked, so I am not sure how they were open. I would've really loved to try the food and not gone looking for something else.",

We purchased a chorizo and a ham burrito and they were sooooooo goood!!! The salsa verde and roja were so well accompanied with the burritos! Definitely cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas in December to eat another burrito. Kinda wish they added beans or queso fresco but that's just personal preference. Keep up the great work!",

They also had Pozole on special, not sure if it was just today or on specific days, but it's great! Lots of corn and some meat, we have some left, so maybe there's lots more meat at bottom. Threw some cilantro and lime juice on it too.   I don't live close to this place, but I will definitely be back to try other stuff. Skip Roberto's and other mid-type Mexican food if you're in the area and go here instead.",

I recommend the fish tacos, with a side of chips and green salsa. The tacos have a small brick of ridiculously crispy fish and topped with a small pile of cabbage and their own \"secret\" sauce. I love to pile loads of their green salsa and hot sauce onto it to add extra flavor and heat. My only gripe is that the tortilla falls apart under all that weight, and I have to finish off the meal with a fork. If you come with a pal, get the side of chips and green salsa with extra chips if you like heat and you're extra hungry. The chips are perfectly thin, crispy, and addictive.  Overall, definitely recommend Phat Phrank's. The only time disappointment and Phat Phrank's go together is when I'm craving fish tacos for dinner and realize they're closed.",

Big friendly smile and very helpful. 5 stars for the torta but overall 4 stars because the lemonade listed on the menu is some weird flavored Kool-Aid drink that is not lemonade, big difference.

The set up was very casual - Staff was friendly and laid back. I ordered a simple Bean Tostada and a Carne Asada Taco. The meat on the taco was very tasty. The rich and savory meat paired well with the soft tortilla and cabbage on top. The tostada had a small layer of beans toped with lettuce, cheese and tomato. Super simple (which I enjoy), but it came out pretty cold.   The prices here are great. Less than $3 for each of these menu items. I would like to come back and try a full burrito and see how the tasty meat and so-so beans hold up next time.",

Phrank was manning the register and I had no idea what to order. I asked him for his top two recommendations. There are some articles on the wall next to the counter and they each had 1 dish pictured.   I went with the Adobada Torta. It took a few minutes to make and was totally worth it. The sandwich explodes with flavor. I have no clue what marinade is used but it is mind blowing. The bread was toasted perfectly and it help back the fresh cut lettuce and cilantro beautifully. My mouth is watering thinking about that sandwich. If he was open on Sunday's I would be there right now.  You rock Phrank!",

    "text": "After reading many other reviews, and needing to get some really decent Mexican grinds going on, I suggested this location to my former boss and coworker who is moving out of state.  Upon entering we were warmly greeted by Frank, who reminded me of my best friend's family and all of her uncles who warmly greet you and treat you like a compadre even though its your first meeting.  I observed him warmly greeting his regulars by name.  Frank kindly explained to us that you order at the counter and then they bring the order(s) to your table.  The food is brought out quickly once the order is placed.  There were a lot of choices and really hard to decide but ultimately we both ordered the chile verde combo plate (rice, beans and tortillas) with a med. drink that was this week's special for $7.89 each.  The combo plate was excellent and reminded me of eating at my best friend's house who are Hispanic, so I grew up eating the \"good stuff\".  Frank also explained and presented to us 4 small cups of different types of salsas, pico de gallo, I think a tomatillo sauce all which tasted fresh and yummy!!  My tablemate took the 2 milder sauces and I took the two others.  The red sauce was pleasantly hot and was very tasty.  I liked the green sauce also.  Frank and his family who were also are servers made sure are drinks were refilled and never made us feel unwelcomed as we sat for close to 3.5 hours at a table talking.  We only wished he served cocktails, so we could at least pay for our extended stay. Frank did mention he may be in the process of obtaining his liquor license to serve beer and wine.  It sounded like he may also open on Saturdays again when he gets this license and Sunset Road opens up.  Let's hope so and because its hard for me to get to this place on the weekdays.  Oh yeah, Frank also provided a sample of his barbacoa which was succulent and tasty.  he described a sandwich they make, and that may be my next choice.",

When you walk in you will realize that it doesn't feel like your typical Mexican joint.  There is no mariachi music playing and no Mexican flags on the walls.  Instead there are musical instruments mounted as decorations and pleasantly soft background music.  The restaurant itself is in a little shopping plaza by a gas station.  It has a clean, newly remodeled feel to it.  Enough with the atmosphere... We went to the counter to place our orders and had the privilege to meet Phrank the owner.  He was a super friendly guy and welcoming.  I ordered the shredded beef and my wife had a vege burrito.  Everything tasted fresh and had nice, balanced flavors.  My burrito was a nice size and not overly huge like some places serve.  I will definitely make this a recurring stop for future Vegas trips.",

    "text": "Famished from an afternoon of shopping, we took a turn into this lot on Decatur, and headed for the deli. To our surprise, there were three fast casual choices in this restaurant row. Since all the menus were posted in the windows, we surveyed our options. We decided on trying something new and patronized Phat Phranks.  Although the name sounds like a hot dog stand to me, it's actually Mexican food.  The restaurant has a strange hodge podge of decor. It's Asian/musical? But spotless, clean and cute nonetheless.  The man at the counter could not have been more welcoming and polite. I assume this was Phrank, as he was featured in pictures on the wall. He asked if we had been before an then walked us through the menu.  After a tantalizing description, we both settled on a carnitas and Carne asada torta. The sandwiches were awesome!! Soft bread griddled crisp and filled with flavorful, tender meat, crisp, fresh shredded cabbage, cilantro, and onion.  The bread was smeared with a refreshing white creamy sauce.  Phrank had explained they use the same stuff on their fish tacos.  The sandwiches are served with lime wedges and 4 types of fresh salsa.  All had great flavor.  We decided we preferred the carne asada slightly more than the carnitas but loved both. The menu included lots of choices for tacos, burritos, tortas, nachos, salad, flautas and so on.  We wereso happy when we left and spent $16 for lunch for two with two drinks.   Phrank even stopped by our table 3 times to check on our level of happiness.  He offered more salsa, and refilled our drinks!   Bottom line - the food rocks! The service will blow your expectations out of the water! I can't wait to go back!",

Her fish tacos were excellent, but my Adobado torte was spectacular, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Had a nice chat with Phrank too as there was no one else in the place. Highly recommended.",

Frank makes it a point to know your name and remembers you; not too many places can do that after one visit. I had one of the best pork tacos I have ever tasted.  The salsas are wonderful, my favorite is the verde salsa. Everything I have tried has been very good (fish tacos, enchiladas, burrito, chips, and tostados.)  I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast burrito and green chile burrito.  Give it a try, you will be glad you did.",

We were both craving some great mexican food and I told her we should try this place because I always see it on my way to the gym and I thought the name was great! We both had the chicken burrito, which was REALLY good!! The salsa was yummy and they gave us a sample of their barbacoa (delicious!). \"Phrank\" himself was sooo nice and very engaging. He was telling us about their food, how they prepare it, and how bomb their bfast burritos are. What made this place stand out from the many other similar resturants, besides their food, was the service we received. Both my friend and I are in the hospitality industry for high end hotels, and we were both blown away by the personal service we received. We intend on going back quite often :)",

    "text": "About a week ago I left San Diego to ride in the desert for a few days.  I was using Vegas as my launching point for Utah and Az, and it wasnt a couple of day before I started craving machaca (I AM from SD afterall) for breakfast.   I wasn't expecting anything on the strip so I began exploring the adjacent ave's. I passed on the first taco-joint that I came across to not sell myself short.  This was fortunate because 10 minutes later (unheard of in So-Cal) I found this little desert rose.  I was apprehensive because it was in a strip mall and I found the name with the \"ph\" somewhat unappealing. Not judging a book by its' cover, I gave it a shot.   I feel compelled to INSIST that Phrank's is a stop if you are in the area.  I was taken in warmly by the proprietor and made to feel that my gamble was in fact just another pre-conceived notion DYING to be dispelled. Though machaca wasnt on the menu, the suggestion of the huevos racheros with the salsa verde was so good it'll make you wanna slap yo mamma! I found the portions satisfying and it was nice to respond with a genuine compliment when asked how I liked my breakfast.  I had to add NOTHING to my dish! No Tapatio, sal, NADA!  I told him as much and he took the remark in stride.   Realistically, I spoke with Phrank at length about food, the Hoover Dam, and bikes and he is simply a genuine man/small business owner who deserves the reviews that I see to the right of my screen,  I probably would have returned to this place even if the food was two grades lower than I found it to be.  Again, I am born and raised in San Diego (Northern Mexico) so I have paid my dues running the gamut of tacos de perro in Tijuas to my Abuelitas Sunday meals.  This place is legit!",

There were 10 of us and everyone except one person loved their lunch. The service was fast and continuous with drink refills. The owner came out and talked to everyone at least once during our stay. He also spoke to each person as they ordered. Very personable. Many said they would go again. I had the Chili Verde Burrito and it was huge (enough for two) with a small side of salad and iced tea for $10.26 with tax. Reasonable prices.  The chili verde was spicy but not overly done. Next time I will order the Chili Verde plate which is smaller. We will go again.",

There are a few standout items on the menu: 1) the adobada torta - everything about this sandwich is just about perfect; 2) huevos rancheros (green) - the chile verde is awesome and the homemade potato chips are addictive; 3) fish tacos - they get the deep fried fish just right, the breading is nice and light and the taco is dressed up the way it should be. Hit it with lime and mild, medium or hot salsa to your taste and these are about as good as you'll find north of San Diego; 4) the smothered chile verde burrito - this thing is huge and rivals the best chile verde burrito in town (found at Frank & Fina's).  Everything else on the menu is pretty standard Mexican fare.  The service is great with the exception of the line that can get backed up at lunch if Frank is not at the counter.  For some reason the rest of the staff can't enter your order quite as quickly.  Even still, the wait is never too long and definitely worth it.",

Burritos were FANTASTIC! You could taste that they were made to order. Burritos had ingredients in every bite and held together to the end. My husband loved the mild salsa and my daughter & I ate the hot sauce until our noses ran. Assuming Frank took my order, he was SO nice and personable! Love that this is a family owned and operated business as my husband and I are small business owners. We love to support local when we can. Hoping we can get back over again before our vacation is over!",

Eva went with the Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito ($5.99): Grilled Steak, Eggs, Potatoes & Cheese. Good breakfast burrito here! Price and portion is fair too.  I'd come back for the Torta alone!

Thought this would be a good chance to check this place out, I've had it bookmarked for awhile but it's 6pm closing time doesn't really work with my schedule.   Frank (or should I spell it Phrank?) was super duper friendly, and there were no issues with customizing my carne asada burrito to exclude rice. I don't like the trend now that bigger is better with burritos, with places using 3+ tortillas. My meal was normal sized, and stuffed just enough to make me full without pwning my face. Speaking of stuffing, it was back to basics with meat, beans, and cheese. The meat was the star, well seasoned and plentiful with each bite. Presentation was simple, but really there isn't much you can do to pretty up a burrito in general.   I also got to try their green and spicy sauces. The green had a nice tang with a medium spiciness. I kinda wish the hot sauce was even more spicy, but that might just be the masochist in me talking.   Phrank's feels like a good place for down-to-earth-fill-you-up meal. I won't be able to do any late night taco runs here if I get the munchies, but I think I could swing by to grab a breakfast burrito before work.",

I was skeptical at first b/c I feel like I'm usually less impressed with sandwiches, but this isn't a boring sandwich at all.  So much flavor.

This is good, honest Mexican fare at a really respectable price. It won't burn a hole in your wallet and it's also not as unpredictable as the stuff served up and places like Roberto's, Don Tortaco, Cafe Rio, and others. Everything has the feel of being freshly prepared rather than slopped together out of vats and it tastes just as good. I really appreciated the texture of the tortillas which were warm and satisfying, dense and chewy enough so they don't split open in your hands, but not gluey and overwhelming, either.  The man himself, Frank, is among the most welcoming proprietors I have encountered anywhere in the Las Vegas valley. He took a genuine interest in me and my wife and remembered my name upon my next visit - admittedly this was the very next day, but that should stand as testimony to the impact of his hospitality and cooking.  This isn't one of those fancy, designer Mexican restaurants, and should not be held up against that sort of establishment - these two sub-categories of Mexican cuisine can barely even be considered the same type of food. For what he is aiming for, Frank scores a bullseye. He deserves his high Yelp rating.",

I was in the mood for nachos but little did I know that had chili verde and melted cheese?   It smelled delicious, a bit soggy but that was my fault for taking my time picking up the food. It I waited a lil longer it would of become chilequiles! I will try to visit once a week. This week I been here twice and both times I enjoyed the food!",

I got the chicken burrito and chips and guacamole, chicken had absolutely no favor. Tasted like someone boiled it with no seasoning or anything and shredded it then placed it in a tortilla. Then the chips and guacamole, this is the first time I've ever had gross guacamole from a Mexican restaurant. Tasted like plain smashed up avocado, I was expected to bite in avocado goodness with tomato, onion, like juice, salt, and maybe cilantro.. But nope bland disappointment. It's right across the street from my job and I will not go there again. It was busy when I went but I'm guessing those people lack tastebuds.",

As far as food goes we order Chile relleno plate (good in flavor), adobado wet burrito (very filling and great for the price), and the adobado torta (to die for.... fresh...best recommendation ever). We even got free refills. Great service, clean place,  and Frank himself if awesome great personality. These phatties loved this place :) we shall indeed return...hoping to try the green salsa (they were out :/)",

It was a very good quality sandwich, don't get me wrong. The bread was nicely pressed and the meat was nicely seasoned, it's just for the price, it left me wanting more. The torta itself was just a little over half the size of a regular torta that you would find in any taco spot and it didn't come with any chips or anything that would substantiate the experience to equal something that felt like a full meal. I would say that this place has potential but as for now, Phat Phrank's is a misnomer and is very misleading to us hungry lunch patrons. But then again, maybe Phrank stay's Phat because he keeps the other half of our meals for himself.",

    "text": "First, a place owned and operated by an American can not be authentic and it's not! It is what most refer to as Tex-Mex.  I am getting more and more disappointed with the stacked Yelp deck and not being able to count on the slew of reviews that are more often than not bought through services.  Considering the amount of reviews this restaurant has and considering the reality that it is no where near to the best \"authentic\" Mexican food and also not deserving of a $ rating, it's reasonable to assume that the majority of reviews here are bought and paid for.    I'm an Engineer married to a Latino. I live here in LV, CA and Texas.  My wife wanted to leave the minute she saw the menu and realized it wasn't authentic Mexican food. However, I hate leaving so we went ahead and ordered.  I got five street tacos on special for 7.45 plus tax and my wife had the Breakfast Chorizo Burrito for about $5.50 plus tax. So our total bill with tax was about $14.50.  The street tacos had about 1 tablespoon of meat...yes that's correct, one bite of food for about $1.50 and that's a supposed \"special\" price. My wife's burrito was larger but again not much meat and all eggs. Considering that you can get a Carne Asada burrito packed with meat and no eggs at almost any Mexican joint for the same price, again the price of $5.50 was way too high for a breakfast burrito. It should have cost no more than $3.99 because again it was mostly eggs.  It would have taken a third meal to fill two people up  because their portions are so small. In fact, after eating here we had to go to another restaurant to eat again. So if you factor in another meal around $7.00 now you are at $21 for two people...hardly what I would call $. It never ceases to amaze me how reviewers rate base on the price of an item instead of what you get for the price. Hence, if they charge only $1.50 for a taco and all other restaurants are charging $3.00 but the $1.50 taco only gives you one bite compared to the $3 taco that gives you 8 bites, the $3 taco is a better deal.   The taste of the food was OK for Tex-Mex but nowhere near the taste of \"authentic\" Mexican food and when you get down to it nowhere near the best Tex-Mex.  I rate the value at $$ and the food at three stars as any legitimate, unbiased, review probably would. Also, the atmosphere had loud American music and was not at all conducive to an authentic Mexican establishment. And, I'm being extremely kind with a three star rating as we WILL NOT be returning which in all actuality makes it a two-star establishment.",

I love that. He is friendly and the place is inviting. He isn't a musician, but he loves music. His shop reflects his passion.    I ordered every taco on the menu to try. The best one is the adobada taco. A close second is the barbacoa. The meat is good quality but it's the simplicity of the taco that I love. Cilantro and some cabbage. Nice touch.   Props to Phabulous Phat Phrank and his great taco shop. I would recommend this place to anyone that would like to have their mind blown while eating some good phreaking tacos.  Note+++++ Phrank's hours of operation are limited. It's basically lunch and bkfast only. Call before you show up to check if they're open.",

The older lady who took my order was nice, but the younger lady who packed and gave it to me obviously doesn't care about customer service. I specifically asked for hot sauce, good thing I checked my bag before leaving because they didn't pack any. Anyways, hot sauce aside, I didn't enjoy my chili verde because I didn't taste any chili verde, it just tasted like a bean and rice burrito.",

We took a look at the menu and the man behind the counter, who I assume is the owner, came over to us with a huge smile and said, \"HOW CAN I HELP YOU LADIES?\"  We told him we were first timers. He explained how a few of the menu items are cooked and told us what his favorites were. As soon as he said FISH TACOS, my eyes lit up. I ordered one fish taco and one adobada taco with rice and beans. My girlfriend ordered one carne asada taco and one adobada taco - TO GO. While we were waiting, the same nice man came and chatted with us for a while, asking us where we were from and he actually engaged in some awesome and genuinely friendly conversation. I was very impressed with his hospitality!   Our food was ready in a few minutes and as soon as I got home, I took one bite into that fried, crispy, juicy, flaky, white fish topped with lettuce and cilantro and a creamy sauce, and I just about died right then and there. Died with pleasure of course. :) Honestly, probably the second best fish taco I have ever had in my entire life, and I don't play around when it comes to fish tacos.   The adobada meat was slightly dry and lacked a bit in flavor. The beans and rice were amazing. i can't quite put my finger on the spice/flavor that made them taste different, but there's definitely something special about them.   Regardless, I cannot give less than 5 stars because of the beautiful explosion of taste that came out of that fish taco. I will be back!",

I crave a good breakfast burrito on cheat days and my Yelp app told me to run here. Glad i did as the $6 sausage breakfast burrito is just what i needed. Not too much potato like most, lots of sausage, and surprisingly not too greasy either. This was perfect for me. The pricing is good for the food offered, the dining area was clean, but the person who took my order could use to learn to smile a little. All in all... i will be back for another burrito without doubt.",

You could tell he was genuine and it wasn't just going through the motions. Was impressed by the food too. The breakfast burritos have some fried crispy potato slices that give a good crunch. Loved it.   Bottom line: great breakfast alternative to over priced places on the strip.",

The owner is a great guy running one very little Mexican restaurant that is cranking out some top notch food.     I had the Chile Verde burrito and it was fabulous.  A pile of tender pork inside with rice/beans then covered with even more pork on the outside.  Another in my party enjoyed the torta and would order it again.  Fresh food made with love and passion.   Everyone working there is hustling but with a smile on their face.

It is braised and then put on the flat top until it is nice and crispy. The torta sandwhiches comes with lettuce, Pico de Gallo and this amazing crema sauce with your choice of salsa. Phrank's has been in the area since 2009 and it is deliciously good food. Everything is made from scratch. We tried the chimi-cheesecake for dessert. It is a flour tortilla stuffed with a flavored cream cheese, rolled and deep fried. Then they roll it in cinnamon sugar and drizzle with caramel sauce. I am so full and so happy. Phrank is a great guy with a big heart amazing recipes. Once you try Phat Phrank's you will be a repeat customer!!",

The fries were crisp, which I find rare for carne asada fries and the flavor was out of this world.   I got a chile verde burrito and my fiance got a red chile burrito, wet red. Both burritos were huge, like Chipotle-sized. The chile verde had great flavor and the perfect amount of spice. The red was almost too spicy (my fiance doused it in sour cream), but the meat was delicious. We also tried all 3 salsas, green, mild, and hot. All were AWESOME. This place is a major threat to our diet plans, as I'm sure we'll be back for more.",

The place doesn't feel or look like Mexican so i was a bit thrown off, but because that sample was so good i had to go in and eat in. I ordered the chicken burrito with the green sauce. The burrito was fresh tasting all the way through. The green sauce was just as fresh and spicy the way i like it. I've tried at least 20 Mexican restaurant here in Vegas and they should be happy i didn't write a review because a lot of people would stop going. I definitely be coming here when i have the taste for Mexican food. A New Orleans jazz atmosphere threw me off. Chairs were a bit rocky, but not where i was uncomfortable. Some calming music in the background. Customer service was perfect and they even asked about our food and explained the menu with great patience. I can call this place as my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas finally.",

I asked what was good and was suggested to try the most popular burrito.  It is a wet green chili burrito. Conveniently, there is picture on the wall next to the register!

Walked in on a Friday afternoon, wasn't too busy, so after my to-go order was placed, I received my torta pretty quickly, within about 5-8 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. The torta itself was AMAZING! I went to a different spot and the torta didn't compare to the Adobada torta. The only reason I'm giving this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because the torta was a bit too greasy, wish the meat was patted down a bit to cut out the grease before it was placed on the bread. I'm not a fan of the higher price tag of a little over 8 dollars, but compared to the torta I had from somewhere else for 2 bucks less, this one is worth the price tag. I recommended this for pork lovers (like myself) who want a delicious flavorful torta.  The green sauce goes perfect with it too!",

The restaurant itself is in a small strip mall with a couple of other food places.  It is kind of hard to see from the street, so keep that in mind when you venture over here.  Once you find Phrank's, your happy tummy time begins!  You walk in the door and can smell the lovely Tex-Mex aromas swirling around the place.  Your mouth starts watering immediately and you get excited for the food to come.  Yummmm.    Phat Phrank's is a small place though, with about 6 tables.  We got there and there was only 1 table open.  My hubby grabbed it while I waited in the really long line.  Within 2 minutes, the line was actually out of the door with people waiting.  Luckily the line moves pretty fast.  The food also comes out pretty quickly too, so there is a nice flow to the place.  After looking at the menu, I was torn between the carne asada and the pork chili verde plates.  I asked the one and only Phrank, who was working the counter, and he told me to go for the chili verde.  I trusted him and went with the verde.  Boy, was I happy with my choice!  The pork chili verde was so tender and tasty.  It had so many layers of flavor that it made you eat slowly to savor each bite.  Delish!  My hubby went for the fish tacos again.  He is addicted to fish tacos and gets them everywhere we go.  He says these are the best in town, hands down.  He really has tried dozens and dozens, so I trust him on fish tacos.  I was going to try a bite, but by the time I asked for one, he had already devoured them.  You snooze you lose, I guess.  The hot sauce here is really great good too.  I recommend the hot hot sauce.  It is super flavorful without being completely mouth burning.  It has some great depth to it and I had to ask for a second serving because it was that good!  The plates came with the main entree, as well as refried beans, Mexican rice, and homemade tortillas.  Now no one tell my Grandma, but the beans and tortillas were better than hers!  I have NEVER said that before because hers are the best of the best!  The beans from Phrank's were simply perfect and I could have eaten a whole pot of them them.  The flour tortillas tasted just like my grandma's homemade ones.    The tortillas were just AWESOME.    If you have never had a homemade tortilla, you are missing out.  Luckily you can go to Phrank's and get some right now!",

    "text": "Oh goodness. I don't think I've found a Mexican establishment that has gotten me 100% of the way until Phat Phrank came into my life. Except for maybe Chipotle but come on now, Chipotle doesn't count. Chipotle is like the unwanted child. BUT ANYWAYS ..   My friend and I decided to try this place after I did some yelping around. Saw this, was on edge a bit because I don't normally go for Mexican but then saw the amazing reviews ...so we just had to give it a go. Let me tell you, no regrets.  The guy who took our orders, whom I assume to be none other than the owner himself, was very nice. My friend ordered the Fish Taco Combo with hot sauce, which was their special for the day while I ordered the flautas. Phrank then suggested that the green sauce goes great with the flautas so I took his suggestion and went with that. He even asked us if it was our first time and that we should try his breakfast items and tortas next. Thumbs up. I liked how he tries to get to know you just a little bit.   When our food came, it looked delicious. My friend loved his fish tacos. And my flautas! My goodness! They were so good. The chicken was moist had good flavor while the outside was crispy but not burnt. The green sauce that Phrank suggested went WONDERFUL with the flautas. I was so happy and in foodie heaven. However, I wasn't a big fan of the guac that came with it because it just tasted weird to me. It was salty .. hum. Anyways, both of our orders came with rice and beans, which were also very good. So when you order your food, eat them fresh!!!  After we were done with our food, we wanted to try their churros. We've seen some of the pictures on yelp and we just HAD to. Though, when we did try it, we were a bit disappointed. It wasn't as light as we would've thought. It was actually quite dense and kind of hard. Also, amazingly sweet. If you're not really a sweets person, I don't recommend it just because it's sweet upon sweet due to the chocolate, caramel, and vanilla sauces they drip over the churros. I almost couldn't handle it.   Service was good too. Phrank checked up on us about twice throughout our meal and was also checked up on twice by another employee on drink refills.   All in all. Amazing. Would definitely return to try their breakfast items next time :)",

    "text": "I decided to come to Phat Phrank's based on their high star rating and was disappointed. I gave this place 3 stars because I can't give it 2.5 The food was decent, but their service and their prices were not great. I ordered the Taco Combo which was $7.99 (not bad); I got the adobada and carne asada. The tacos were good, their salsa was good, but the rice and beans were pretty mediocre. The rice looked fluffy, but there were a few undercooked, crunchy grains. The beans tasted a little like they were from a can. I also ordered their chips and guacamole, which were pretty good, but not worth $5. I also got a large horchata for almost $3, which would've been okay if it didn't taste like the powdered stuff you get from the Latin market. Lastly, the lady who took my order was NOT friendly at all. She seemed like she was annoyed and like she didn't want to be there. For the tacos, she asked if I wanted mild, medium, or hot salsa, but she didn't elaborate on what types (red or green), and I totally didn't feel welcomed to ask. I wasn't greeted, thanked, or asked anything other than what I was ordering and that was because I walked up to the counter. All in all, the food was not bad; I'd eat their tacos again. Their decor was pretty cool too. However, my lunch experience was NOT worth the $20 I spent.",

    "text": "As usual, I ended up coming here based on the bookmark part of the Yelp phone app. I bookmarked this place awhile back because of all the check ins from my Yelp friends and couldn't help but notice the four and a half star rating. Judging by the name, you wouldn't think it was a Mexican joint.  As soon as I walk in I am greeted by Frank (or should I say Phrank?) himself and asked if it was my first time. I guess me looking for some kind of menu on the wall gave it away. He directed me to the menus on the counter. He briefed me on some of the popular items that people get. The thing that stood out to me was that anything on the menu whether it was breakfast or lunch was available all day. That's a major plus if you ask me because who doesn't want a breakfast burrito for lunch sometimes?  Anyways, I went with the Adobada Burrito because im trying to cut down on red meat so pork is the next best alternative. The burrito itself had shredded chunks of tender pork mixed with some rice and beans. The pork itself was a bit salty but was still edible especially with the green, red, and spicy red sauces that came with it. All were excellent when you pour some on the burrito.  Based on the menu, I will definitely be back to try some of the others that people have mentioned. The only thing that I find negative might be the hours. 8 am to 5 pm. So if I wanted to take my fam for dinner, it wont work. I guess based on the location, they are only busy during the morning til late afternoon. I guess you cant have everything.",

Walking in I was greeted by an older Mexican man whom I think is the notorious \"phat Phrank\" he was so funny and welcoming , reminded me of my own family. The wait time was extremely long but then again we went around lunch time but man it was worth the wait! It is a couple of bucks over priced but we had just landed in Vegas we were craving Mexican and this place popped up woth good reviews so we had to try it. I ordered the tostada with pork Adoboada I think that's how u pronounce it lol it was excellent!!!! Will def be back!",

    "text": "Experience:  Went with friends about 1:00 on a Thursday. I had never been here and the name alone intrigues me.   Facility: It is a very small place located in a strip mall. There are tables and chairs for about 20 folks. I was pretty impressed with the fork, spoon, and knife dispensers. Such a sanitary way to get your plastic ware!  It's a fast food type feel, but they bring the food to your table.   Service:  I went to the counter and a very personable, nice guy greeted me. Even though there was a few people behind me, he took the time to talk to me. At the end of my order, he asked my name, and introduced himself...turns out it was Frank, the owner. What a nice guy!!!!!  The rest of the staff were friendly and attentive too. Although you order at the counter, they bring the food to you, and even bring your drink out first. Also, they will refill your drink too. I just realized I didn't leave a tip on the table!!!  Man!  Well, I did drop some in the tip bucket up front when I ordered, so I hope they all share that. Sorry guys, next time I will tip for the great table service too!!!!  Food:  I ordered the Carnitas plate with a side of hot sauce and fried jalapenos. The Carnitas (3.5/5) were good. I liked the beans and rice with a touch of salad on my plate too. The homemade flour tortillas (5/5) were so good! The fried jalapenos (2.5/5) were actually grilled (or fried) and marinated. It's not that I didn't like them, but I just prefer the natural flavor of either a fresh or plain grilled jalapeno. Frank came by and I mentioned my preference, and he immediately exchanged them for fresh jalapenos. Yum! This topped my meal off perfectly.   Overall:  I'm a fan. I like the food, I liked the service, and Frank was a real gem. Too bad it's not close to my house, but I will be back.",

The prices are all very reasonable and the food is delicious as well! I had the fish tacos place which comes with rice and beans and is enough for a meal, but I indulged my sweet tooth and went for the chimi cheesecake as well. The fish on the tacos is breaded lightly and the sauce on them is delicious. The salsa was fresh and had a very small kick (I went for the mild). The chimi cheesecake was also good- very sweet and very filling, the serving size is good for 2.  I will definitely be coming back here!",

    "text": "After picking my fiancee up in the morning, we took a quick look for some off-Strip food joints that were serving breakfast, and we ended up at Phat Phrank's on a Friday morning. At 10 AM in the morning or so, it was pretty empty, so we were able to order right away, and our food came our relatively quickly (around 5 minutes or so after we placed the order). I went with the barbacoa breakfast platter, while my fiancee went with the huevos rancheros. Both were really good - the barbacoa was cooked enough so that it shredded easily, and it really goes well with solidly-done scrambled eggs. I do say I wish I could have combined it with the huevos rancheros' pepper sauce, which added a real nice kick to her dish and made the dish flavors much more vibrant. While I like the idea of the thinly-sliced fried potatoes (they sure looked like plantain chips, but they definitely tasted like potatoes), they're a bit on the light side. Given the rest of the meal is relatively hearty, I think a bigger serving, or adding a side of Mexican-style rice, would have been a better way to round out the dish.  I'd like to come back sometime to try the regular offerings, but breakfast on its own was okay. It's better than your average breakfast, but I've had better Mexican-inspired breakfast dishes at other places.",

I had a meeting on the other side of town and had to pass by the Decatur & 215 exit on the way home around lunchtime, so I decided to finally give Phat Phrank's a try.  Since I'm on my Lent 'No Meat' diet, I was browsing the menu for Meatless items.  The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=diO_EDsbajdUCPr988G3Ng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4...</a> I went with his suggestion and also added a Bean & Cheese Burrito ($4.29) for good measure.....ha! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4...</a>  He chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.  After a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.  I went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.  I'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.  Return Factor - 97%",

Right off the bat, I assumed they would be small, but when my order came out, they were teeny! 5 tiny double tortilla tacos with just cilantro and onions and salsa. There was absolutely nothing to them and certainly not worth $2 a piece. I've had better flavor at the 65 cent taco joints. My husband ordered the deluxe fries which were also nothing special the portion was also skimpy. I wouldn't recommend. The service was mediocre, I didn't feel welcome and the atmosphere was odd for a Mexican place. We left hungry and disappointed.",

My favorites are the fish tacos (best I've had), pork green chile, and the Barbacoa but everything has been excellent.  Great choices in salsa too. The restaurant is clean and Phrank is always welcoming.  The service is not fast because this is not fast food!  Also, the price is slightly higher than their competition but I'll pay a $1 more for better food any day.  If you ask, \"What did you not like?\"  I would have to say I don't like the forks and knife self service dispenser but that's just being picky.   Overall, 5 stars for food, service, cleanliness, and overall experience over 20 visits.  Thanks Phrank!",

I went in there and ordered 4 breakfast burritos, 2 orders of chips and guacamole and one large drink. It was $53. The lady had this nasty attitude to begin with. She seemed very inconvenienced that I was there when they had only one customer and then myself. There was some sort of worker there - construction or maybe like a utility worker but the lady was talking to him like it was a personal conversation and when I got there he was in the kitchen. Anyway I was very nice and waited for my food since it seemed like she was the only one working. When she gave me my food she handed me a menu and said here is a menu so next time you can call in ahead  and then proceeded to say oh and by the way anything over $50 we are supposed to add an automatic 15% gratuity to it !  umm no!! If I were dining in maybe but not for a take out order !! You're out of your freaking mind!! The whole time the lady's attitude sucked as well.",

    "text": "Excellent! Another bookmark down.  This review is long overdue. I had lunch here almost a month ago and I could not stop raving about it to coworkers when I got back. The experience is still fresh in my mind. I had the daily special Fish Tacos, but I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn. Everything was made fresh, and the slaw on my tacos was TO DIE FOR. The creamy sauce was perfectly seasoned and the fish was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't mushy - it was cooked perfectly. My husband had a chicken burrito and he could not get over the salsa - he said it was the best salsa he had in his life.  Nestled behind a gas station and some heavy road construction, Phat Phrank's is a jewel in the rough. It's perfect for a power lunch, or maybe picking some to-go food when you just don't feel like cooking.   As I sat there one random Friday afternoon, I had seen people from all walks of life come in and out happy. There were suits, construction workers, Louis Vuitton ladies, and families either dining in or picking up to go orders.  Frank was there during my visit and couldn't have been nicer. He made sure to talk to every customer and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. He's super helpful when you're trying to figure out what you should order. I asked him why they weren't open on weekends and he had said they were once, but business wasn't worth a 7 day schedule. He did say once the construction on sunset was completed, they would definitely be open Saturdays again.   Fresh food, great service, reasonable pricing - this place is an easy 5 stars. As the unfortunate duchess of a certain Roberto's, I can proudly tell you that this place is definitely worth stopping by and checking it out !",

You're greeted right away usually by the owner Frank himself. You can tell he takes pride in his restaurant and it really shows in the food. Amazing mexican food! This time around I had the Chile Verde burrito. The pork was tender and flavor packed. Not greasy or fatty like at some places, just the perfect balance. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for some great authentic mexican cooking! Also they are now open on Saturday's.",

They have yummy home made salsa and a pretty big selection of food to pick from. We will definitely be back!!! The desserts also looked really good, but we didn't get to try them.",

    "text": "We stopped in a little after 6pm and were the only ones in the place (it's more of a breakfast and lunch spot from what I gather).  The owner greeted us and was very friendly to my wife and I, explaining some menu items and pointing us to some of the more popular items.  My wife got the fish tacos and was very pleased with them.  I got the Chile Verde Pork burrito, which was massive, had plenty of meat inside and tons of flavor.  Each dish comes with his three salsas, a mild and hot red and a verde.  I'm a big fan of verde (green) salsa, and his was excellent.  We're from out of town, but if I am ever in Las Vegas again, I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "The hype is True! I was wary for ages: 5 stars? Isn't it just a glorified Roberto's?  Nope, nope, nope, and I'm saying that as someone who likes several styles of Mexican cuisine, but not usually this type of down-home fare.   The bean and cheese burrito is already calling me, and it's only 8 a.m. as I type this. The beans have a savoury nomness (that word was overdue in the making) and the cheese is a swirl of hot comfort.   The bean tostada may as well be rebranded as a mini-salad, the toppings are so fresh and lovely.   Even my orange Fanta seemed to have extra fizz. The pretty decor (check out those high ceilings and the violin near the front) convinced me to stay and have our first PP meal there instead of taking it home.   But where Phat Phrank glows is with the ten-star service. We've enjoyed some excellent service lately, but owner Frank sets the bar out of reach of most mortals.   I'm still more into \"fussy\" Mexican, and Phat Phrank's doesn't offer my beloved potato taco, but I'll be back... again and again.",

I have had nothing tastier in even the most expensive sit down Mexican restaurants. Frank knocked it out if the park on this one! the flavors are incredible! between the secret sauce and the carmalized meat its just surging with flavor. I'm soo impressed that I signed up for a yelp account just to write this post. Frank's is one of those small hometown gems, family run that is just so lovable. Thanks for the great food, you have a customer for life!!!",

It's in an unassuming strip of stores/restaurants but don't let that stop you. It's a tiny place but clean and the food- wow! A gentleman I assume was Phrank welcomed us and proceeded to explain the menu, ordering, & specialties. So helpful and friendly! I went with the Adobada torta. Crispy seasoned pork- just the right amount of slow burn. Hubs had a carne asada burrito which he described as awesome. Kids had carne asada fries, carne asada tostada, & carne asada plate. All devoured in no time. (Meat eaters- what can I say?) We arrived early for lunch- 11:30 local time- and were alone initially. By the time we left people were lined up waiting on a table. Well worth it in our opinion. Heading out of town on a road trip but will definitely be hitting Phranks again before we fly out!",

    "text": "When reading one of Vegas's local magazine, I happened across a food review that touted Phat Phrank's as having the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  In my youth, consumption of Mexican food in Vegas was usually only done after indulging of some non-alcoholic Roy Rogers and Shirley Temples on the Strip (extra grenadine of course :P ). In those days, I would be willing to wager that you could have fried a shoe and it probably would have tasted good to me.   But this article indicated that Phat Phrank's was pretty darn good and I was craving some carne asada so...   I arrived at about 12 pm on a Thursday and the place was hopping. A line of about 7 people quickly formed, which gave me some time to peruse a laminated menu for what I wanted to eat. I settled on a carne asada burrito with a drink for about 7 dollars. Frank gave me a number, and told me to pick a seat and they would bring my food out to me. About 3-4 minutes passed and a reasonable sized carne asada burrito was delivered to me.   Stand by for carne asada burrito dissection...  Tortilla - This was ok - had the consistency of a whole wheat tortilla (a bit harder).    Carne Asada - While this was seasoned appropriately, I was a bit disappointed at how much of the Carne was too fat to eat...I'm used to a little bit here and there, but about a 1/4 of my burrito was annoyingly fatty.   Beans - Beans were flavor-fully non-offensive and didn't take away from the meat thankfully.   So all in all, Phat Phranks's was Phrankly ok. The reviews on Yelp make me think that maybe that was just a bad burrito day for Frank and his family. Unfortunately, I have yet to try Mexican food outside of California that is worth a repeat trip, but I'm willing to go back to Phrank's and try something else next time I am in Vegas to see if I feel any differently.",
