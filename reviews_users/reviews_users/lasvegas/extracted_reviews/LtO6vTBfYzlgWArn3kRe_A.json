There are 3 locations in the city, but the best is this location because mostly locals go here and it's not as crowded as the other locations. The Mexican food here is outstanding and as authentic as you can get.  The tortillas are made fresh by the tortilla lady and the meats are prepared on the spot and constantly replenished because of the large volumes of patrons.  They have the BEST adobada tacos (make sure to ask to garnish your taco with the pineapple), it's just so damn good.  I haven't yet tasted an adobada taco that rivals this one.  The carne asada fries is a must try and a mix of Mexican and American staple as it's best.  I'm a creature of habit and I order the same thing when I visit my mom.  The best location for visitors is the one on the strip because it's an easy walk from the Fashion Mall or the Wynn Hotel.",

The right lane is usually if you order any of their pork meat and the left lane is for carne asada. I'm usually on the lane for their pork meat.  Lines tend to be long depending on the night. The workers here serve quick.   I usually order the capechana fries which is a combination of both carne asada and adobada meat and on top of that with cheese and sauce. I also get their adobada tacos.  When you're done ordering you pay at the cashier and that is where you could pick up your drinks or any salsa.   There is plenty of room to sit.

I was expecting tender, juicy and flavorful meat; instead, we were served dried out and tough meat with questionable flavor.  The guacamole tasted like it had come pre-packaged and there wasn't even a salsa bar in this supposedly authentic mexican street food eatery. If this food is really just like the street food in Mexico, it would explain why there are so many mexicans trying to sneak over the border!",

I'm not from Vegas, so I can't speak for how bad their lines get, but the day I went, they weren't bad at all.   Like I stated earlier, their tacos are exactly what you'd expect a good imitation of TJ street tacos would be like.   I'd definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas!",

They will make a cheese quesadilla for the kids, too, but we haven't had to do this yet.

Ordered one Adobado taco and one Carne Asada taco.  They were pretty small and prices ranged from $2.25 to $2.45 for each. Taste wise I'll give them a 4/5. Fantastic flavors and definitely different from your standard Robertos and Pepe's Tacos. Atmosphere was lively as well. If I'm on that side of town/ nearby them I'd probably get one taco for on the road. Other than that I wouldn't drive out of my way just to eat a taco from them as well.",

My girlfriend wasn't upset at this point, but what upset her and myself was the fact that two of these female employees then laughed when they thought she left the restroom and continued to make jokes about her while she stood there and listened. I can't even begin to explain to you how degrading that was for her. Seeing the embarrassment on her face was heartbreaking. So NO, I don't recommend this place because the employees are HOMOPHOBIC and judgmental.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo hits the spot again! The fam and I had the midnight munchies for authentic Mexican street tacos and were excited we made it just before closing at 2:00am.   I prefer this location because there are two spacious dining areas and works well if you're dining with a large party.  To order, you must wait in the appropriate line for beef, pork, or \"other\" proteins such as cabeza or lengua (beef tongue). My fam's favorite is the adobada (spicy pineapple pork) and Asada (beef). All tacos are served in freshly made corn tortillas, but you can also request flour. I also love their white cheese quesadillas in a flour tortilla. So soft, fluffy, and delicious! The tortillas here are just on point.  They also serve fries, so you can order them with any meat toppings such as Carne Asada Fries - my son's favorite.  Be sure to request all the fixin's for your tacos such as pico de gallo and guacamole. If you like grilled green onions and peppers, you can request that too as a complimentary plate.  Red or green salsa's are available behind the register, so make sure you request a few from the cashier.  Having to stand in multiple lines for various proteins is a bit of a bummer. But that's just the way TEG operates, so understand this going in. Your wait time could be a little longer than if you were at taco shop like Roberto's, so plan accordingly. It's totally worth the wait though!",

He's gonna totally hook you up, so you want to show some love.   The love here is fat. Tacos fat too. How fat? Fattest tacos I ever saw. You try to pick one up and keep everything inside the tortillas but there's just no way. There's at least 10% more meat than the tortillas can handle.    That's good, too, because the meat is screamingly delicious. You will never be happier to be filling your face than with a couple fat Tacos El Gordo tacos    Places like this I always say \"I'm coming back for the Asada Fries,\" but that's BS. I know I'll be back but I'll get the al pastor every time. LOL   In addition  to a variety of canned sodas, they also have a self serve Coca Cola dispenser.    All the employees are super friendly, happy, and amazingly fast at what they're doing. At each station there's a different dance behind the counter.  Probably should try them all.

Being that my husband and I recently moved to Las Vegas, we were ecstatic to be close to an El Gordo location. Including, the one that is the least busy AND has the most seating. This place will change your taco life forever! My husband lives by the Adobada, it's both of our faves, but I like to branch out. Their suadero, cabeza, lengua, and tripas also make their rounds at our different visits. This is the only place I will eat lengua and cabeza. It just isn't as good anywhere else. I'm telling you, you will not find a better street taco ANYWHERE!",

We also shared a half order of the Carne Asada Fries because even a half order is HUGE. The fries are nothing special and I have to say that the toppings weren't the most flavorful I've had.

Everyone I know states the same no visit to vegas is complete with out a stop at Tacos el Gordo, it's funny because there are hundreds of taco places in Vegas but this truly is the king of the taqueria. The flavor is authentic as well, this is truly Tijuana style Tacos, reminds me of growing up and crossing to Tijuana to shop at Comercial Mexicana and eating Tacos at tacos el Gordo.        A little advice I will give you is that you can actually order any type of taco from any line just as long as you are ordering from that particular meat also, in other words while ordering asada you can order al pastor also, they will send someone for you to get it, they know their lines get long and they don't want you eating cold food. So it is something they do to help out. They also have a very large selection of soft drinks both Mexican and American Favorites.",

I have read reviews of people complaining of the price, $4 for the Vampiro and $2 for the others is a great deal considering it is Las Vegas and I am willing to pay the price to sit down and eat in an air conditioned building or be inside when it is cold.   The location is in an industrial area so do not expect anything fancy, and they are beginning to add photos on the wall and the building has been recently painted.

They salsas are also delicious and complete the flavor. Service is so so, you can't really expect much. The one drawback is that there are different lines to get tacos with different meat. So there are times that one line is much longer than the other, or people in front of you are ordering a million tacos and you have to wait. Because there are different lines, if people in your party are getting different meat, someone might get all their tacos way faster than everyone else, or a line is so long that you other tacos get cold before you can even order a different kind of taco. But other than that, it's still worth the wait. This location also has plenty of seats available, compared the the one on the strip.",

    "text": "45 minutes in line just to order our food!!!  Are you kidding me???  I remember having my first taco from Tacos El Gordo.  This was close to 20 years ago, TEG was just a small taco stand, and the location was in TJ (right next to Caliente Sports Book & Senor Frogs to be exact).  As a teen or in my early 20's, we use to hit up Caliente, place some bets, and finish the night off eating tacos that cost roughly $.50 each.  Around the early 2000's, TEG started to invade the 619. They didn't have a restaurant in the US at the time, but catered a lot of events and parties. Heck..I even had TEG cater one of my daughter's birthday parties back in the day.  Their food was phenomenal, the service was impeccable, and the price was by the hour.  There was a huge demand for TEG's street tacos in the 619.  The demand was so big that they eventually opened a few restaurants in Southside San Diego.  Tacos El Gordo the restaurant was born and the rest is history.  The original TEG in SD (ie. Chula Vista) is very similar to this location.  The prices are about the same, the two separate lines (one for asada, one for al pastor) are the same, the taste/quality is the same, and the wait is the same. Actually, SD's location is a little faster, but just a little. The GP and I decided to give this TEG a try. We waited about 45 minutes to place our orders, which is way too long.  The gurlpren went directly to the al pastor line and I went straight for the asada line. One item that this location has that the SD location doesn't have is Carne Asada Fries. So, I opted for Carne Asada Fries with two sides of Asada Tacos.  I admit, their street tacos are as good as it gets. For $10, they really hook up their Carne Asada Fries.  And for $2 each, the Asada Tacos were also hooked up. Taste wise...TEG in the NLV is pretty close to the TEG in the 619.  TEG's Carne Asada Fries is pretty good, but the not the best that I have had.  I still killed it, though.  However, they still rock a pretty damn good street taco.  And if it wasn't for the long lines, I would have probably given them 4 or more stars. Overall, I am a fan of TEG's food.  I'm just not a fan of the lines.  Gracias very much!!!",

    "text": "Although the LV Blvd location is now closed, I've now been to all 3 TEG's in town...and in my opinion, they are still one of the most overrated and overhyped joints in town.   For starters, this location has so much potential and I just can't understand what they are doing here. From just Yelp tips and seeing the place by driving by, I know they've been working on getting this location open for at least 10 months or longer. If you haven't been here yet, this new setup is in an old gas station...yes, the entire gas station is now a restaurant. Well, not quite yet actually. Even after almost a year of working on opening this location, they only have a very tiny portion of it open. There are a whopping 12 booths available to sit at. TWELVE! And if you've ever been to a TEG before, you know it's almost always busy and can be a big pain to grab a seat.  That also brings me to my next issue with El Gordo. Because they can get so busy, it can take a ridiculous amount of time to grab food, especially if you want different meats or items, and if you have a couple people with you. When you finally get your food, you then have to move to what will probably be another long line at the cash register. Your food is likely getting cold by that time, and if not, it will almost certainly be cold as you're standing around waiting for a table. The whole thing is just one big mess and makes me dread going here. Other similar restaurants are able to make this process much less frustrating, I don't get why TEG can't do the same.  When it comes to the food, it's always so hit and miss that I just can't see what the fuss is all about. Sure, the al pastor is decent, but there's much better in town. Plus, unless you get lucky with someone decent behind the knife, you're probably going to end up with a portion nightmare. Every time I've visited a TEG, one taco is loaded with meat, the other has barely any, then they're drenched in sauce but super skimpy on the fixins (onion, cilantro, pineapple, etc). And on this particular visit to the new location, my tortillas were way overcooked and tasted stale like they had been sitting out a while. The onions and cilantro also appeared to have been sitting out for a while, and they forgot my requested pineapples...dang it!  While pricing isn't terrible, the tacos are pretty small and I can easily spend over $10 just by myself. But that's just about the set price for any taco joint, so no real complaints there. They also seem to do a decent job at keeping this location clean, which is a major plus in my eyes. But with what is just ok food and a frustrating ordering system, TEG barely hits the 2.5 star mark for me.",

    "text": "Same...yet different. The family and I stopped by TEG right before the dinner rush. I order 2 tacos de adobada con pina and one asada. The service is just as fast and friendly as the other 2 locations. We paid for our food and sat down in time to watch the whole place fill up.   Our food was good, the pork was spiced perfectly and I would say the salsas had a little more kick than usual, but still had great flavor. The asada was tender but lacking in flavor the salsas part way made up for it. My kids devoured their asada tacos, meat and tortilla only. So they were edible but not as tasty as usual.   Now when I mentioned we saw the place fill up it wasn't just people, smoke was so this in that place it gave me a headache. And we were seated by the door! I'm not sure if someone turned the vents off or they need better ones but it kinda ruined my meal.   My favorite TEG? No. Not at all. Will it do? Sure! I'll be seen eating there.",

I've seen the sign at the Cheyenne and Losee intersection for at least a year and was happy to hear via Yelp that they were officially opened up in my neck of the woods.  So I went in tonight after work and there is a lot of space in there compared to the other location.  Thank God for reading the Yelp reviews or I would of been intimidated in trying to order my food. I found the comments about three lines for different meats very helpful because there were so many people waiting in various locations.  It took about 20 minutes for me to get up to the window to order my Adobada Fries. You may want to bring a spanish speaking friend or your phone so that you can google what the heck you are ordering. I was going to wing it but since I had so much time in line, I decided to use my phone to figure out what Campechana was and I'm glad I did. I almost ordered seafood fries consisting of what may have been oysters, baby octopus, mussels, shrimp and/or squid!  The restaurant was really clean and there were lots of employees who were working their arses off. The meat cutters were chopping meat like they were cutting up crack in the movie New Jack City. I hope they make their menuboard more \"gringo\" friendly.lol  I really appreciated the person who stood at the door at the LV Blvd location to help you place your order.   The food was really good. I wish I would of known to ask for no guacamole or sour cream. I just scooped if off and drowned the rest in extra sauce.  I honestly won't go out of my way to come back here with Roberto's on every corner.  The food is definitely good though and you get your moneys worth as it is very filling.",

The carne Asada, chicken, and beef tongue taco are all good, but You have to try the spicy pork taco, it's the best taco there for sure! El Gordo puts a special house sauce on it and you're going to want more than one. Don't forget to try out their carne asada fries and spicy pork fries that comes with the same sauce  on the taco #BOMB  They also carry all of the original Mexican drinks like Horchata, tamarind, orange whip, and melon juice. Last thing they carry if you wanted a snack or candy are little tamarind balls (located right next to the check out counter)",

The carne asada tacos had a nice grilled flavor while being tender, and were topped with fresh tomatoes, onions, and chunky avocado. The cheese in the quesedilla were grilled directly on the griddle and had a nice nutty flavor to them. The beef shoulder tacos were really moist with fresh cilantro, onions, and topped with a red sauce. The green sauce I got on the side actually had a little bite to it. Everything tasted excellent.  I'll definitely be coming back here since it is closer to my part of town, and while they are a new location they are still serving great tasting food.",

We ordered Pastor tacos, Lengua, Pastor fries, and a \"Vampiro\" (a tostada sandwich with your choice of meat, pico, cilantro, and a slab of cheese).  To help speed up the line, there are three order windows. They are identified by what type of meat you want. Still slow going, but definitely helps. Tacos are $2.25 - $4 each depending on what you get. The fries are more, $13 - $15, but they are a good size.  True to it's name I felt like a gordita when I left.",

Happened to see this place on the outposts of the city in the NE so decided to check it out.   Food is served cafeteria style where you order where the chefs are and then brought to a cashier just off of where the chefs are located to pay for your meal.  I had a few of the Carne Asada tacos and they were SO GOOD.  The meat was firm and flavourful and the flavours were BIG.  There was also a small condiment stand in the vicinity to load up on lines, onions, and the like.  I'm not sure how else to describe them but they were delicious - just all of the nuanced flavours that you hit you at once as you dig into each bite.   Why not 5 stars you may ask?  The price.  I am not a big guy by any means but at 3 tacos, that was nowhere near enough (For reference, I'm at about 160 pounds).  For any adult male, you would need at least 5 tacos .. which would set you back about $14.  That was just my experience but keep that in mind when you order from here.",

From the street, I thought this was part of a gas station until I went inside and saw they took over the whole building. You have to get in separate lines depending on the type of meat you want and then you go pay after you set your food! When I ordered they asked if I wanted everything that comes on it... I said yes... he said \"are you sure?\" I told him yes.  I wanted to experience it the way they intended it to be. Carne asada tacos with onion, cilantro, salsa and guacamole. Tacos al pastor (also called it adobada) with onions, cilantro and some type of cream salsa (and pineapples of course). When I sat down I made sure to eat slowly to enjoy these tacos.... and boy I'm glad I did.  In fact, I went back and got 6 more for later on. This is how I remember street tacos tasting. I've had to live with Tex Mex or east coast Mexican (meaning not very good) for the past few years!!! I think this will become a weekly spot for me to eat at! Fast, fresh and awesome! Don't know what else is on the menu because the tacos are THAT good! And make sure you get EVERYTHING on it!",

Once in any line you can ask for any other meats you want as well and they will shoutout your order to the guy working that particular meat!   Also, They have quesadillas too! And free grilled onion and or peppers !   Overall great place to have tacos !",

The guy taking orders at the Adobada is without a doubt the worst ever. Rolls eyes, cuts u off as ur ordering.  Won't let u finish bcuz he just wants to move on. Only reason this place blows is bcuz of this guy. No point in complaining cuz the ladies there won't care. And I know bcuz an Asian couple did complain n it was nothing.mostly bcuz the lady spoke little English and was too busy to care. So u been warned. Good tacos, shitty service.",

Tacos El Gordo is my fave taco spot in San Diego, so imagine my delight when I found out they came to Vegas! Most menu items are on the same level as the original spot, so big kudos there!  Asada, Al Pastor, Adobada, Cabeza, Lengua never fails. Tacos, Fries, Mulas, Vampiros are all delicious!! Don't forget your grilled veggies, salsas, and tasty beverages!  This spot is significantly less crowded and better maintained than the Charleston location. I think varying customer service, long lines, and difficult parking situations during peak hours are normal for a humble yet busy taco shop, and this place is no different from the rest in that sense.. but I find they are polite and accommodating more often than not. If you come with the right expectations, you should leave with all that matters, a very happy tummy!!",

Ordering was a bit confusing at first.  There is an ordering window and a payment window.  It's not clear if you're supposed to pay first or order first, so I'll let you know that you order first.  And, the window you order from is determined by what you're ordering.  I went to the pastor window and ordered, then went to the asada window to order a couple more.  Both sets of tacos were packaged separately on paper plates covered in foil.  We paid at the counter, and took our tacos to go.  We had a short drive, but when I unwrapped the tacos, the pastor tacos were nice and warm, but the asada tacos were cold!  Like completely cold.  Also, the toppings differ depending on the type of meat you get.  It's not your typical onion/cilantro combo.  Since trying this location, I did try out a Tacos El Gordo in California that was AMAZING, so maybe I tried them on an off day.  I'll try again and update if needed.",

I actually came here at 9am when they opened (yes, tacos for breakfast is a thing for me!) and surprisingly we weren't the only ones dinning at that time. We tried the Asada, Buche, Sesos, Steak, Lengua and Cabeza and they were all amazing. The grilled green onions and peppers added to the flavor. We also got a half order of Lengua Fries which were AMAZING. Buttery melt in your mouth (or tongue) Lengua! -See what I did there??  I guess I wasn't wowed this time by their food since I already what was coming. The first time they blew my mind (my drunk mind).",

I would sooo be mad if I waited in line that long and it tasted like this. Flavor just did not wow me. Honestly, the street tacos at Jefe's Taco Shop is so much better. Luckily, we went for an early lunch at 11am so there was no line whatsoever.   Ambiance: I was glad how clean it was in here. Crowd was mostly in military uniform from nearby Nellis AFB.   Service: friendly and with a smile so that was nice.",

If you don't understand what they ask at the end, just say, \"Yes!\" You will not be disappointed. There is a reason the fries are over $10, it is a huge amount with toppings galore. Delicious!!",

I'm sure people passing by can see without having to go inside since the line does go out the door.   I ordered the Sope de Asada without onions...sorry but onions make me cry (literally). I would have ordered more items since they have such a value menu here, but I don't like soggy sope or tacos so therefore, like superman I inhale and go! Don't want to be bursting at the seams when I still have a long checklist of things to do that requires taking the little one in and out the car at every stop.

They have their own parking lot and a lot of cars can park.   First time here, just FYI, there were 3 different lines you can stand in depending on what you want to order. If you don't know which line is which, at the front of each line, there is a see-through menu listing which lines can order which foods. Also, if you wanna order drinks that's in the pay line on the other side of the food lines. (I didn't know that so I thought I would mention it and save you from looking like a fool LOL). The longest line is always their popular Adobada Fries. It was a 45 minute wait for just ordering in that line. Other lines are pretty quick.   The Adobada fries are very delicious. Lots of flavor, a bit heavy with the sauce and fries were kinda salty for me, but other than that I was great. The 3 of us ordered 1/2 fries since we ordered something else too. I ordered Chicken Mulas. It was recommended by my friend and it was really good. The meat is so flavorful and yummy!!! With my mulas, I also asked for grilled onions, yummss, which they gave to me on the side.   They have a lot of tables and seats. A lot of people sit in the front, where people enter, but here's also a side area where it's a bit empty.  If I do come back, I would definitely come hungry!",

    "text": "The tacos here are 100% delicious but prices are expensive for tacos. I grew up in a majority Hispanic community and have been eating Mexican food for as long I can remember. Tacos el Gordo is famous for their El Pastor tacos. These tacos are one of the best tacos I have ever had. They come on double corn tortilla, onions and cilantro, el pastor meat that's been roasting and is cut in front of you, and the most delicious green sauce I have ever tasted. I had other items on the menu like the carne asada but it's mediocre as best. Even if you are not a fan of el pastor I recommend trying it before going for carne asada. I feel that the price for tacos at this place is kind of high, about $2.25 for each taco. I'm use to getting tacos for $1 so it was odd for me getting 4 tacos and paying roughly $12 for it. Also, they have separate lines for ordering if you want different meats. There is a carne asada, lengua, and the el pastor line. You order first then you pay at the cashier. I feel this is a very inefficient way to order because it means if you want carne asada and el pastor, you have to wait in 2 different lines. The el pastor is the most popular yet only 1 man fills the orders. The line can get very long and move very slow. Overall, I love eating tacos in my home town of Southern California, but the el pastor tacos here are a must try.",

I'm just wondering why if you don't like to interact with people get a job like this or if you not feeling good go home but don't ruin customers day if yours ain't going that good. Good food goes along with great customer service. Also hot sauce was salty again like two days ago that's terrible.",

I came here with some friends and let me tell you. Pulling up to this joint was already a red flag, the restaurant was inside of a building that was previously a gas station. The parking sucked, cause they still had empty gas pumps in the middle of their \"parking lot\" waste of space.  Upon walking in the place looked really dirty and unsanitary. Tacos are tacos so despite all of that they still gonna be bomb right? WRONG. These tacos were so nasty, the meat was cold by the time I got to sit down, when i ask for salsa they put a huge splat of guac on the entire tortilla and the entire meal was so bland. No flavor at all. I forced myself to scarf them down cause I was hungry. But 20min After I wasn't feeling too hot. I ended the rest of the night throwing up dry ass asada and tortillas. I would NEVER go back.",

All the food is the same quality as the old Strip and Charleston location.  There is limited seating, so be prepared to stalk the tables if you plan on eating here.  My favorites are still the adobada (spicy pork) tacos...make sure you ask for pineapple with it!  The adobada tacos have the avocado/sour cream sauce that helps balance out the spicy red sauce.  My second favorite are the carne asada (steak) tacos, which have a nice charred flavor and comes with cilantro/onions/and avocado.  I've also tried the suadero, but the meat is just a little dry for me. I would prefer the lengua (beef tongue) over the suadero (beef breast).  If you like a little side of grilled veggies, you can ask for the grilled onions/peppers as well. I haven't been adventurous enough to try the cabeza (brains), beef stomach, and tripe yet...but one day.  I love that the drinks here have free refills....that means I can drink horchata all day =P.",

Even though this location is a lot less crowed than SD the food and staff did not make up for it. Let me begin with the workers: Rude, rude, rude. I understand they have to serve a lot of people, but you don't have to give me glares. They were also very sloppy about putting the tacos together, especially the al pastor guy. Maybe he was having a bad day, but he looked like he wanted to kill someone as he put my tacos together. Also, the food is not very consistent. One of my tacos tasted like burnt meat, and the another was super dry. The rest of my tacos were good on the other hand. But overall, I'll just stick with going to SD.",

The start of the show is the adobada meat. It's a spicy sweet pork with a tangy green sauce! Triggers every food sensor in your body! If your new here and dont know what to order, order 4 tacos de adobada and 1 mulita which is basically a quesadilla, oh and get the mulita on flour torilla!",

They were out of carnitas, the shredded beef was suggested and it ended up being my favorite. You can ask for non spicy salsa or my favorite, spicy. Unlimited limes and radishes available on a cart inside the restaurant.   Once you get your order, you pay in a separate line. Tacos are 2.75 and drinks are 1.75. I thought it was a bit pricey for tacos. Some lacked in the amount of meat. Drink selections are good and unlimited, enjoyed the pina colada.  Overall, we found the tacos to be flavorful and the meat cooked perfectly. Probably doesn't need two tortillas. The meat portions doesn't require it.   Plenty of seating inside and out. Super casual location.",

The food was cold meat was very fatty it was so hot in the restaurant. I got a quesadilla and the cheese wasn't even melted at all they put a soft corn tortilla on the bottom the nasty cheese that's cold and not melted and about 2 pounds of fatty cold steak with a hard, burnt, cold, shriveled corn tortilla. If I could give This place a -5 stars I would save your money don't go here trash it's a literal trash.",

The tacos were fresh and they're loaded with flavor, they were small but  fulfilling. Mind you, you order first-get your food and then pay, so be prepared to hold some stuff. There's nothing really else to say about this place, bathrooms are clean, people are nice, it looks seedy but I trust this area more than nicer places here in Vegas.

I was on my way to the Nellis Air Force Base from Downton and decided to stop by to this taco shop to get something to eat. I must say the food quality is amazing and it tastes just like the kind of tacos you'd find in Tijuana. The ambience is casual and the staff is nice. The cooks are experienced and quick to get your order ready. The pricing however is a little exaggerated. I have never paid $27 for 4 tacos with 4 small quesadillas before it's just too much money. Maybe they should tone it down on the pricing and it would be even better. Overall it's a great taco shop, actually it's the best one I've tried so far here in the states. So stop by and check it out if you're in town.",

    "text": "Was in town over 4th of July weekend, had heard about this place here on Yelp, so figured to give it a try. Figured to skip the strip and head to TEG instead for lunch. It's a short 10 minute drive up I-15, and pretty much right off the FWY (after a couple turns). As has been mentioned on here, this new TEG is a converted gas station (You know how when you go to like an AM/PM or QT/BP/Race Trac to get gas they always have the one-stop-shop building behind the pumps where you pay for your gas and grab snacks/drinks? Yeah, well that's what this TEG is). I don't mind it at all, but they need to invest some money to get rid of the area in the parking lot where the gas pumps used to be, and make that into parking spaces.  Anywho, back to the review of TEG lol... So yeah, we went there for lunch on July4th. We were expecting the place to be packed based on Yelp reviews. To the contrary, the place was semi-desolate (I counted only 7 different patrons in there eating while we were there). So that was pretty cool. Judging by those who were there, it seemed like many locals frequent the place, at least during the afternoon hours.   There was only 1 person in line in front of us, and so ordering was easy. It was our first time there, and I had read that you had to get into different lines and what not. We didn't. We just went to the guy standing behind the counter to the far right, and placed our order, and simply kept walking over to grab our order accordingly (sort of like the lunch line when you were in grade school).   I skipped breakfast that day, because I wanted to make sure that I had a big appetite so as to taste as much as I possibly could, this being our first time. I ordered myself 3 tacos Al pastor, 3 tacos of asada, and 1 regular order of steak fries. Moms ordered herself 1 taco Al pastor/ 1 taco of asada and 1 sope of asada and she ordered pops 2 tacos Al pastor/ 2 tacos of asada.  Coming from LA, the land of all things authentic Mexican, we came in wondering how authentic/good TEG would be compared to the LA fare, and let me tell you, the Al pastor tacos were DELICIOUS! My parents commented on just how juicy they were and how tasty the meat was. We noticed the Al pastor tacos are put in different (smaller) double-tortillas, whereas the asada tacos were put in larger (single-tortillas). I'm going to assume this is both to make their bread/butter tacos (Al pastor) taste better, but also to possibly save on meat (granted, they do load the tacos with meat). While the asada tacos were good, I much preferred the Al pastor tacos (Not sure if it was the tortillas or the meat, or a combination of both), but they just had a better flavoring/taste than did the asada tacos.   I am very glad I ordered a regular sized portion of the steak fries, because I was unable to finish it. To be honest, the steak fries were just meh to me. Nothing special about them. I mostly ate the meat/toppings and a few fries. It would have been nice had the fries been crispier and less soggy, and at least with some taste to them. (I grabbed a couple of fries from the bottom without any meat/toppings to make sure it wasn't my taste buds messing with me, but nope, the fries lacked any type of seasoning to them.) I'm going to assume they don't really season their fries, expecting you to use the meat/toppings as seasoning-- But other places, they really season their steak fries and you merely add flavor to it with the meats/toppings, not here.  The asada sope moms had, she thoroughly enjoyed and raved about. She said it was very well done, and the sope was tasty and not overdone. It helps that they have the masa (corn flour mix for the sopes) right there in front of you, which means they're making the sopes to order, rather than having them sit under a heat lamp-- This really makes a huge difference in the taste of any food (fresh vs stale). My parents are suckers for fresh made roasted tortillas (aka tostadas), and moms noticed they had them right next to the sope mix, so she asked for a few tostadas, which the kind lady was generous enough to give her 5. We're not used to eating sopes with tostadas, and so what my parents did was, they used the tostadas instead to add the excess meat that had fallen off their tacos unto the tostadas and drizzled them with the great tasting in-house salsas they had available.   Overall, we had a pleasant (and cheap) lunch experience at Tacos El Gordo, and certainly will give them our business next time we're in town. Myself, I'm definitely loading up on just tacos Al pastor and having my fill with those.",

The Al Pastor tacos were smoky, lightly spicy and I can see why they're a local favorite.  The Asada fries were loaded with meat and the smoky flavor went really well the fries and the same green sauce an the Al Pastor tacos are on there as well.

I wanted to wait for the hype to settle down  and decided to stop by for dinner last night.  I ordered two adobada (sp) tacos with everything and a half order of carne asada fries. The adobada was crunchy.. maybe overcooked. It was so crispy that it took away from the taste of the taco. The carne asada  ratios are way off. The standard order comes with a ton of fries and sour cream with a sprinkling of meat, cheese and avocado. The carne has such great flavor, but every other bite was gristle, so half of the dish was inedible. The excessive amount of sour cream made the dish cold.  I spent over $12, which is a bit pricey for what I got. The half order of fries was $7.. that's the price of a full order at Roberto's.  I probably won't be back, at least not to this location.",

I've been craving these ever since my trip to Mexico a while back, and I'm so happy to see this joint come to this side of town!  There are lines for different meats. My mom likes carne asada and my cousin and I love adobada. We decided to try the mulas too because my friend recommended it, even adding the carne asada fries for the hell of it! However, I am going to complain about the price again because for a small carne asada fries, we forked over $5, where you could go to Roberto's 5 minutes away and pay the same price for 2x the size.   The flavors were so authentic, the service was decent, and even with the long lines, the food was worth the wait. Great place for some late night cravings. Definitely coming back again!",

Which are a hand made tortilla with the meat, sauce and condiments of your choosing and a glob of cheese on top with another tortilla to top it off! So it's like a Mexican taco burger to put it in short words! DELICIOUS!!! Best place to eat tacos in vegas.",

My sister and her wife had suggested this place to eat some bomb tacos so we all (4 of us) decided to give it a try especially, when all the reviews are positive. I ordered Mulas( carne asada), and 2 tacos, 1 of suadero ( which it wasn't, they gave me carnitas), and asada. The tacos tasted good, however, I felt sick the whole day. I threw up 7 times and had to constantly go to the restroom. By far the worst food poisoning ever!! Not even tijuana tacos or street tacos had me feeling sick like this before. The oil is probably 6 months old (If not longer), the meat is probably spoiled/rotten, and the cleanness of the kitchen area is probably dirty. I will never eat at the new facility or from this food chain ever again!",

    "text": "Its hard to describe how amazing this place is. I'm not sure what kind of sorcery they put on their recipes but this place changed my life. The tacos are out of this world the bomb. I mean, I'm from Chicago. Everyone knows we have the best of the best when it comes to authentic, local, organic and or  quality food. You name the country we've got the restaurant and its legit. However, this taco stand reigns supreme on any Mexican taco joint I've ever tasted in Chicago. Getting here was a blur. I was drunk and in tears from missing my flight that night. My cousin took us in a cab and it took what felt like forever to get here from the strip. According to my cousin they used to be located on the strip but I guess they relocated because they couldn't keep up with the demand  it was just way too busy there. We finally got there and the line was long AF. I was still drunk and crying so my cousin sat on rock with me outside consoling me while his fiance and my hubby went inside to order. After about 30 minutes in line they emerged with a giant tray of tacos, cebollitas, jalapenos and horchatas. We all drunkenly sat on the floor and ate with our hands like savages in the night. My husband said he saw an older woman making the tortillas by hand. You could totally tell the tacos were so good. By the time we finished I had sobered up about 20% and felt wayyyyy better. Just as we realized we were on the floor in the middle of nowhere, we started trying to figure out how to get back to the strip. Suddenly, a man in a security outfit emerged and started walking toward us. My cousin freaked out because he thought we were in trouble so he blurted out to the stranger in uniform \" No Habla Espenol!\". The stranger than replied in perfect English, \"Sir, I work here I'm headed back to the strip, just wanted to see if you folks needed a ride?\" We accepted his ride, jumped in his taco truck and laughed all the way back to the strip. Good times, good times.....",

I asked the lady in line behind me about the different types of tacos and she explained which ones were spicy. If you're not sure you can also ask the security lady outside. We ended up ordering 9 tacos total which was too much for me and my husband. It only cost us $26 i think. His eyes are bigger than his stomach, lol. There are different lines for the types of tacos you want to order so we just split into two different lines. I could only eat 2 and a half and I was full. There are a few tables inside but we decided to just eat outside standing. Out of all the places we ate at in Las Vegas, this by far was the tastiest and cheapest. Even compared to the fine dining restaurant we went to at the Venetian. If you want something authentic and cheap, come here.",

They have carne asada, adobada, cabeza, tripa, buche, azteca, suadero, lengua, and chorizo. Their adobada is spit-roasted with juicy pineapple on top. On top of authentic flavors, they offer a variety of dishes including soles, mulas, quesadillas, tostadas, or, if you're having a cheat day or just a fat kid like me, have your choice of meat on top of a to-go container of fries with guacamole, sour cream, and shredded cheese. That'll finish your night perfectly after the tequila shots. However, I can't say your morning will be any better. A must try for Vegas visitors and a must staple for Vegas locals.",

    "text": "OKAY. So there's a big reason why I am giving Tacos El Gordo 1 out of 5 stars...  a couple weeks ago my friends and I visited the establishment late at night. This was my first time coming and I was so excited because I have been hearing great things about this place. They didn't have everything on the menu since it was really late at night and I can understand why so that wasn't a big deal. We got what we could be able to get. I got 1 taco de lengua and 2 tacos de asada. They were absolutely delicious and they even give you the little onions on the sides. For my first time, it was amazing and I was absolutely looking forward on coming back again.  A couple days later, we came back and I decided to try 2 tacos de pastor, 1 taco de cabeza, and 1 taco de asada. The thing is.... I FOUND A TOOTH IN MY TACO. I was shocked. I'm not one to be grossed out about things... but a tooth in my taco??? They tried explaining to me that it's normal and they tried offering me free food but honestly after that experience I didn't want to ever come back to eat tacos there again. I've had many tacos in the past from authentic places and this was by far one of the most shocking experiences while eating at an establishment. YUCK.   On top of that, the cashier and the employees on the floor had nasty attitudes after I asked about the tooth in my taco. I'm better off making my own tacos at home.",

He did it again and he seemed so surprised that we still had one last order, then he rolled his eyes and scoffed right at our face, basically saying \"are you kidding me?\" My boyfriend even apologized and he just yelled \"NEXT\", basically just pushing us away as if we were a burden to him.   Normally, we would let something like this slide since I understand this place can get super busy and I assume stressful for the employees. He might've had a bad day or something, but the way he sneered at us was extremely rude and left us feeling kinda awkward.. like wtf? We were so confused. The experience we had today was just one of the worst ever I just had to write a review.

The street feeling of it, but not literally out in the street.  They have all kinds of meat from your usual standard taco meats to the more internal organ type stuff. See what I mean about street. I am not an internal organ or one for the uncommon body part so I usually stick to my Carne asadas.  Their tacos were delicious and as authentic as it could possibly taste considering I have never been to Mexico to even know what authentic Mexican tacos taste. But because they're so good...I'm assuming this is it right here. Heard this company is actually a business from Mexico.   I had to dock a couple stars for inconsistency and perhaps overhyped. I did rave about this place to fam that were in town. Had the guys go out on the taco run. Upon returning, I was extra eager to eat my taco, but then I bit into it and almost threw up. My Carne asada tasted like an internal organ, it did NOT taste like Carne asada at all, although, it looked like it. I took another bite and i couldn't even swallow it as I had the first time. I had to spit my food out in disgust and disappointment. I think what happened was they probably didn't wipe up their knife and cutting board properly so when they chopped up my meat, it was mixing in with whatever crazy meat was on there prior. I never went back.  They are good, though. I recommend it to anyone who feels like indulging into some decent tacos. I simply have my own personal tastebuds, opinions, and gross factor which will take me sometime to recover. I shall return, eventualy. Hope I don't catch such luck again. Hopefully YOU don't catch such luck.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",

I am always so happy pulling in here. I might have to struggle for parking once in a while but still happy. You walk in and they have separate lines for each meat category. The first time I came I have to admit I did not know what adobada was. Everyone was getting it and I was like ummmm, sure why not. I had the fries. They were delicious. I was surprised by all the flavor and freshness of all the food. I think I was hooked. BTW it's like a spiced pork. The next time I tried their asada tacos and they just weren't as good as the adobada. Don't get me wrong the asada was tasty on it's own but the new cool thing was adobada. The last time I got three tacos to go. Such a good decision. They can get so busy and packed at night, especially on Friday and Saturday. They also have drinks like horchata and fountain sodas. One you get your food you pay at the register. They have some salsas behind the counter along with some canned sodas, including grape soda, yumm. One of my favorite place to get tacos. They also have a location on the strip and another on Charleston and Bruce. A place that keeps me coming back.",

My husband and son are obsessed with the half pastor half asada fries, they stay crispy, the guac is killer, we passed on the sour cream. Why they closed their prime location on the strip is beyond me, but both their other locations are close enough and more than worth seeking out. Both have outstanding service, amazing food and way too long of a wait to get your food. You really have to be lucky to find a seat here, worst case eat it in the car or outside, again more than worth it. Prices are fair, the $10 will fill you up for days, the $2 tacos are tiny, get at least 4. A must stop every time I am in Vegas!",

This location was surprisingly big with 2 sections for seating. You walk in and go left to find a similar set up as other locations. 4 different lines for the various kinds of tacos. The one closest to you when you walk in is where you want to go. The first meat to order is adobada, or spicy pork. Ask for everything, which will include onions and a green creamy sauce. Also, ask for pineapple as they will not give it unless you ask. Next, make your way down the line and order some cabeza (beef head) and lengua (tongue). They might sound exotic for those who are not use to eating a variety of meats, but they are the most excellent. If you're not a risk taker, today is the day to start. Ask for everything and they'll give you a green verde sauce as well as some onions. Each taco will cost you around $2.20 to $2.40. A little pricey for such a small taco, but oh so worth it. If you're on a budget, just get a couple and grab some free limes and whole radishes. Eat enough and it'll fill you up. This location pretty much rivals the others with 2 exceptions. The tortillas are freshly made, but the ones we got were a little soggier. Second, the adobada was a little on the crunchier side this time. Nothing completely horrible, but none the less a little different. Come here whenever you're in town. It's the place to get your taco fix!",

Ordering the food seems a little inefficient for the customer, but I can understand splitting the lines depending on the meat you want. The three(!) lines for placing your order move at a decent pace, and then you have to get into another one to pay.   The carne asada was dry and underseasoned. I was more than a little disappointed with it, as well as the particularly tough fried tortillas they used for the tostada. The cactus was just ok, smaller pieces would be nice.  But the tripa was flavorful and had a good texture, and the cabeza was incredibly beefy and moist. Tortillas had the right amount of bite. They managed to hold together despite the large portion of protein they give you.  And oh my goodness the Al Pastor! No wonder they have a completely separate line for it! A good amount of heat, very tasty and moist (though helped along with a good bit of sauce); I ended up eating two whole tacos of it despite my already sizeable meal.   I'll be going back, and now I'll know which lines to stand in.",

Bottom line, the rookies go to the Las Vegas Blvd. location, the pros come here.  Why come here? Because the lines are WAAAAAY shorter! In all the times I've been here, it's been busy, but never out-the-freaking-door busy. As you can imagine, the Las Vegas Blvd. location is full of tourists and local strip traffic. I've never not once ever had a problem with lines here, and it's why I'd rather come here than go to the closer, yet way busier, Strip location.  So if you wanna feast on your helpings of adobada and carne asada and everything in between, go for it! Make sure to make room for the carne asada or adobada (or both like I do it!) fries, they are amaaaaazing! The food here is on par with the other Tacos El Gordo locations I've been to in Vegas and Chula Vista, so you're not missing anything by coming here.  As I've already mentioned, everything goes really quickly here. Staff doesn't mess around, they make sure you're in and out of the taco lines as soon as possible. And the great thing about this location is that there's plentiful seating everywhere.  Without question, this is definitely the El Gordo location I prefer when I come to Vegas.",

Only drawback is a slightly inefficient ordering process if you want different meats. There were 3 lines and each had a different selection of meats. That's fine, except when it's crowded you don't want to stand in multiple long lines.  After you get your food, you goto another line to pay. Ugh. At lunchtime, the lines are long.",

These can definitely compare to the tacos that I've had in Ensenada but the Ensenada ones still win with those handmade tortillas. The customer service is great every time I come to this location, but since I speak the language there is no miscommunication or language barrier.  I've came to this location plenty of times and one of the times was a Sunday. That was not my best move. It was super busy and the lines were long but I didn't mind a whole lot because what can you expect when you go to the best taco spot on a Sunday afternoon after church. So choose wisely on what day and what time you want to go but either way the tacos will not disappoint.  After reading the past reviews on this spot I did read that some people think there should be a better method on how the lines work but how the lines work inside this place are pretty simple after you read the signs. (They are in english and Spanish) The lines are separated by the meats so if you are looking for Pastor you stand in one line or if you want Carne Asada the other and so on.  Overall the food is very tasteful, the service is great and I will most definitely keep coming back.",

It can cut down the wait since it breaks up the line. However, if you want to have more than one meat time, it is a little inconvenient cuz you want to wait multiple lines. For that reason, we opted to get just al pastor and ordered both sopes and tacos. The Al Pastor was AMAZING! Meat is cut fresh to order. The meat was perfectly spiced and had this yummy sauce on top. I preferred the sopes to the tacos, but would order both again. Next time I'll brave a few lines so we can try more, but I would be totally content getting just al pastor all over again.",

And this as my first location, it can be super sketchy as we were in this area both day and night.  Let's just say that you're better off in this area during day light.   As you walk in and towards the left, you will see different lines for different tacos. Longest line goes to the pastor taco, and it's worth the wait. They will assemble it fresh for you and what toppings you want and then you put it on your tray and pay at the register next to the lines.  I believe the tacos were $2.25 each and though I didn't think the asada tacos were worth the price, the pastor is super flavorful!  There's much other type of tacos that you normally don't get anywhere else.   The shop itself layout is kind of weird, kind of like 2 different stores into one. There's 2 drink stations, one on each side. Love having Horchata as an option. Would totally come back, maybe just not this location especially during at night.",

Nicely this time around it was just me and family ordering so after paying we got to enjoy our food while it was hot.   My wife and Mother in-law ordered carne asada tacos with everything on it. I ordered lengua tacos with everything. And a full order of carne asada fries. Everything tasted fresh and consistent with their other location as far as flavor goes.   My only other complaint was that the carne Asada  fries was lacking... well  carne asada. I thought It had very little meat for a full order of carne asada fries  should have. it had  lots of sour cream, guacamole and salsa but my wife and I had to poke around for the meat. I even think we got more meat on the  half order. But still love the over all taste and definitely would come back.",

Thank you Tacos El Gordo for always having superior service and food! I would definitely recommend to anyone craving tacos.",

    "text": "I can't even list how many times I've been here. To be honest, it's actually been a 3 years since I've last been, but now that I have a yelp account I just want to show this place some love from all the way over here on the east coast.  Any taco place I go to in my immediate area gets compared to Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is basically my American standard. Now, I've had tacos in Mexico (when I was in Tijuana!) and those were hands down the best. However. Tacos El Gordo has literally been the best tacos I've ever had in America. Ever.  EVER.  The lengua or cabeza tacos are my favorite, but I'm a freak for that kind of stuff. As others have mentioned, tortillas are freshly made. Basically, everything is freshly made. I love that they have a little side bar that you can get fresh sliced radishes and limes and salt and salsas. At the counter where you order the tacos, you can get grilled green onions and peppers and cactus and I'm pretty sure they don't charge you extra (unless they changed that. I hope to God that they didn't). And lemme tell you. Get the cactus. And the grilled onions. And the grilled peppers.   Every meat that they offer here, I have tried, and let me tell you. I have never been disappointed.  EVER!  Perfectly seasoned, it just has that authentic taste, and it isn't dry. And for the most part the servers just top it off with diced onions and cilantro. And if you were to eat it like that? It'd still be fantastic.  I dream about the day I get to come back here again. Please don't ever close down, Tacos El Gordo. And, if possible, please open a location in Florida.   Please.  I love you. I love tacos. I love you and your tacos.",

Place is ur typical mexican joint serving tacos.  Only difference here is there are 5 lines for the type of mean you want.  Asada line 1, al pastor and chorizo line 2 and so forth.  Lines are not organized.  My line for pastor tacos was somewhat short but my wife's line for asada was long especially since person in front of her ordered 22 tacos!!!!!.  That meant that I had to wait for her and by that time my tacos were cold.  I was upset to say the least.  Asada meat was dry with no taste.  Felt like i was chewing on beef jerky. Pastor was ok. Sauces are plain, not spicy at all.  I like to sweat from a good sauce, only reason I was sweating was due to no AC.  Outside temp was 105 degrees. Tortillas were too oily for my taste not to mention small.  Two bites and kiss that taco goodbye.  Prices are a bit high with each taco going for over $2.  Not alot of options besides tacos.  Restrooms were dirty and one toilet was clogged.  AC was not working.  Tables are not cleaned after customers leave so you have to clean it yourself.  If your group is bigger than 4 people, chances are you won't sit together.  Would I come back?  Read my review again to get that answer.",

I suggest getting at least four or five so you don't have to get back in line.   Even if you're not sure what you like order a ton as you can share or trade with others in your group.   Their drink options are standard with soda fountains as well as the other Mexican Frescas.  When you're finished eating, be sure to try the fresh made pastries should outside with the dude in a truck.   If you're in Vegas and don't want a burger or a buffet, this is a good option.",

I had the adobe pork tacos and tacos vampiros. Both awesome combinations of meat, seasoning and heat. Everything was 'flavorfully spicy' but nothing was 'burn your face off' spicy.

I will always try my best to come here during every Vegas trip. This location is also way better than the Charleston one because the lines aren't as long (still pretty long though, but not nearly as bad), there is plenty more seating and space, and most importantly, the tables are away from the line so you aren't eating surrounded by hungry people waiting in line! My only knock is the set up because you basically have to wait in different lines for different meats which is a bit of a challenge, but as long as you have enough people in your party, each person can wait in separate lines. The carne asada line is always the longest so be prepared to wait for that one.  Each taco is about $2 which really isn't all that bad and they have all kinds of meats. I usually stick with the carne asada because I've tried the cabeza and that was a little too fatty for my taste. I always also get a mulita while I'm here because I have yet to find a place that makes one that tastes just as good! It's $4 and I usually get full off of one of those and two tacos. I definitely recommend it. Also be sure to ask for extra cebollas on the side! It goes great with everything here.",

I, however, am less fond of Mexican food and will be content with Taco Bell. Obviously this isn't a fair statement as the two aren't comparable. The tacos here are really good and the service is always quick. It isn't the most pretty place to eat, but it gets the job done. (The pink paint for the building is hideous).   The food itself is much better than average. Namely, the adobada, cabeza, and lengua tacos are all so fresh and delicious. Definitely get the extra pineapple with the adobada tacos, its worth it! They are fairly cheap as well. To top it off, they are open late for any late night cravings. Would recommend.",

My husband and I stopped to get a few tacos to go since we were close by. Mind you this is the first time, they have a very limited menu most of which I won't think twice about eating.   Ummm the el pastor tacos were good,buuuut carne asada had little to no flavor. Boy I tell ya, if I didn't  my have cilantro and onion I might of spit it out. Ugh! Chile and verde sauce uhhhh I just don't know. This was not at all what I expected so I feel horrible for even writing this review. Maybe it's best you go with the other reviews.",

    "text": "We came here at a recommendation of our local Las Vegas Uber driver who is fond of Mexican food. My companion was so excited about this place as Seattle where he is based has such a serious shortage of good Mexican food. It was to the point where we came here straight from another dinner because we didn't have enough time left in Las Vegas to come check this place out later.  The place has a few shops in Las Vegas area and is frequented by lots of local, Mexican people. That's a good sign! The particular location that we went was around the corner and took over the place of what used to be another defunct chicken fast food joint...it's next to another fast food joint which I already forgot the name..so be sure to look out for it.  The place is definitely known for its adobada pork. You could tell because upon entering, you could get into different lines depending on what you want (e.g. regular tacos/Mexican food with chicken/beef, etc) or a specific line for adobada. Really, pretty much everyone I saw lined up for the adobada..and the line was quite long...so be patient!  Two of us ordered quite a lot ..different variation of adobada...tacos, fries, etc and they were all good!!(as you could tell from our photo). The price was super affordable...all we got + 2 drinks for a little over $20!! Great deal..no wonder why locals come here!  Check if out if you are looking for a local, tasty and affordable place to eat. There's a location closer to the strip, too..but we purposely wanted to avoid potential crowd and chose to uber to this location instead.",

    "text": "I love Tacos El Gordo, and will always try to make it a quick pit-stop whenever I am passing through Vegas. Yesterday was my first time at this location in particular.  LOCATION: Conveniently located right off the 15 freeway! I guess it used to be a gas station, but it became a taco restaurant!  PARKING: There are a couple of spots in front of the shop, I think you can even park around the closed gas pumps, there's also a lot of parking on the side and back of the restaurant.  RESTAURANT: Similar to their other locations, casual seating, order tacos at their designated lines, and pay at the register. This location is pretty spacious, there are two full rooms with tables, I didn't have trouble finding myself a table around noon yesterday. There's also a self-serve salsa bar towards the side of the restaurant!  MENU: Very straightforward. If you're in the mood for beef tacos, there's a single line for that. If you're in the mood for pork tacos, there's another single line for that as well. I recommend going with a group so you guys can make the ordering process more efficient. One person can stand in line for beef tacos, the other can stand in line for the pork tacos, and the rest can find a table to sit.  My friends and I ended up ordering their asada and al pastor. Both are delicious, but the al pastor was definitely the winner. I like how slightly charred the pork was and it tastes so good with the guacamole and toasted tortilla. I could easily eat 3 of those in one sitting. The asada was also good too, packed with a lot of beefy chunks and the salsa was nice and mild.  CONCLUSION: I am never disappointed with Tacos el Gordo. The tacos are a bit pricey ($2.40 per taco), but they're absolutely delicious, and 3 of their tacos are enough to fill me up. I definitely recommend their tacos to anyone passing through Vegas!  Quality tacos without burning a hole through your wallet.  Remember to arrive early before the lunch rush because the line only gets longer!",

I didn't know about this location until my cousin mentioned it. (If the owners are reading this, please build one in Henderson :-) we need one down south!)  I spontaneously went to this location on Friday night with my relatives (they live in this area), it was this or Taco Y Taco, 2 against 1 voted for Tacos el Gordo cuz it's the best in Vegas!   We ordered a bunch of the adobada tacos (most popular, longest line).   When I'm not dieting my go-tos are: tacos, mulas, and loaded fries with adobada or carne asada. All with everything on it.   TIP: Don't forget to ask for pineapple, grilled peppers & onions! So good on the tacos or as a side.   A few things I learned on this visit:   - you have the option to order the meat only by the pound (est $16) or half-pound: $8! I will order this next time! (I didn't know this prior to ordering.)       **Note: I'm on a Keto | Low Carb (diabetes) eating plan and I would've gotten more for my money ordering a half pound of the meat and getting the sauce and toppings on the side.   - they offer catering, order in advance. (great for grad or birthday parties)  - kid-friendly -- the security guard gave my cousin's baby girl some candy while we waited in line. And she was happy with her cheese quesadilla, for a 1-year-old she's a picky eater / doesn't like meat.   - this location is not as busy as the others, we went on a Friday night.   - tons of space & seating!

El Gordo keeps it authentic from the music blasting,  the staff and of course,  all the food.  You can't go wrong but if you want to try something that can become addicting, go for the Al Pastor.  I've been to the locations in San Diego and the one on Charleston Street in Vegas and neglected to write a review back then. The prices have gone up a little and it adds up because it's too easy to eat three tacos or more at a time.  The logistics seems similar at each location. Go up to the guys near the grill. Be ready to tip a few bucks in the jar to whomever preps your tacos.  Note: Between the three of us, our bill was over $35. (!) That's a lot of tacos. The decor is no frills, basically red and white cafeteria style.  Plenty of parking. We had dinner early. Beat the crowds!",

Last night I was here and ordered a carne asada taco, a carne asada quesadilla and then got the large order of carne asada fries. I ate the taco and the quesadilla and ended up taking the fries home. When I went to eat the fries, it seemed that the peoces of carne asada that I got were very chewy and inedible. I was a bit bummed as I'm a frencfries guy and wasn't able to enjoy them.  I got on the phone and called the restaurant, talked to the cool young lady up front, told her I was just there and reminded her of our conversation so she knew who I was. I told her about the issue I was having with the food and she got Adrianna on the phone.  Adrianna told me to come by anytime after 7pm to either get a refund or get another order of fries. So being that I wanted to give the fries another chance, I had to get the food. This time I got the adobada and it was just what I was looking for.  To sum up my experience, good food and good people that care about their customers.",

When I got to the counter the man would not even acknowledge me for at least five minutes while he tidied the counter and busied himself with anything but helping me.  I patiently waited.  When he was ready to take my order he called me a \"Gringa\" to his co-worker and had him get my tacos.  I ordered the adobada pork tacos.  My kids wouldn't touch them and the meat was chewy and nasty.  We threw them away and went to Del Taco.  When I told my husband about our experience he looked at our recipe which stated that I had ordered the tripas tacos (beef guts taco).  I wasn't in the beef line, I was in the pork line and I very carefully ordered something that was kid and family friendly for first time customers.  This was a racist joke on a \"Gringa\".  I'm sure these tacos would be delicious if you can earn their respect which obviously is not earned by a white woman with her children.",

The lines are always long, but the service is quick and there is plenty of room for customers in this former gas station.   Speaking of the lines, when you first visit Tacos El Gordo, you might be a bit confused. There are three lines, each of which offers a certain type of meat. Bad news if you want carne asada, tongue, and pork, because they are all in separate lines. But if you go with a bunch of friends, you can each hit a line and order for the group, then take your trays to the cashier to pay up.   My friend tackled the carne asada line, and I hit the tongue (one taco each for each of us). Both were great: smoky steak and tender tongue. There is no salsa station, and the condiment bar consists only of radishes and limes (what, no carrots?), so ask for your order with everything on it if you want more than meat.   This is a bare-bones establishment, but the bone structure is solid. As I and the dozens of diners around me can attest, if you're looking for a fast, tasty taco (or a tostada, sope, or quesadilla), this Tijuana-style eatery is among the best in the Valley.",

Tacos El Gordo is always a good choice - most people would agree which explains the long lines at their other locations. I came at the right time when there was no line and the place was practically empty - it was weird.  I normally get the same items: adobada taco, carne Asada taco, Al pastor taco, horchata...and carne Asada fries when I feel like I deserve it. Great meat-tortilla-fixins ratio. The flavors are wonderful. And tacos are inexpensive. Sure, the horchata comes from a vending machine but I still like it. I can drink as much horchata as I want and take it home with me. Mmmm...  My bro-in-law likes their tripa taco. I don't eat tripe so, I'll just have to take his word for it.  The people that work here have been the friendliest group out of all the locations I've been to. They have more tables here than the other locations. This used to be a Sinclair gas station but the gas pumps are still there. Can I pump gallons of horchata?  I came home with puffy lips and itchy throat - I also forgot that tacos have tomatoes and I'm allergic to them. But how can you eat Mexican food without tomatoes??? The discomfort was worth it.",

All meats have great flavor and even their gooey cheese just melts in your mouth. The tortillas are hand made and just add to the deliciousness known as Tacos El Gordo. Their carne Asada fries are packed with meat, cheese, and sour cream. You must try these!!! I like that they have multiple locations in the valley and their service is great pretty much at every location. Tacos el Gordo is a popular brand therefore expect some wait times during their peak times but the wait time is certainly worth it!   The only negative comment I have is that they are a bit pricy and an order of a few tacos can add up. I wish they kept their prices as if they were in Tijuana, LoL.",

I used to frequent the Tacos El Gordo at their Charleston location, but lately I've been going to the Craig/Losee location because the Craig/Losee location is now closer to my work.  This location compared to the Charleston one is a lot bigger with two large dining areas with tables to enjoy your tacos at.  To get your tacos, you line up at the counter at three separate lines and tell the worker what tacos you want and how many.  Be sure to pay attention to the signs above each line because the separate lines serve different/certain tacos.  After you have obtained your tacos, you take it to the cashier to pay and then you can finally enjoy these delicious tacos!     Usually 4 tacos is enough to fill me up, if I'm feeling particularly hungry I get 4 tacos for myself and the spicy adobada fries to share with my friends too.  For taco choices I highly recommend the spicy adobada tacos (spicy pork) and the carne asada (steak) tacos.  These are always solid and every person I've gone with here has enjoyed them as well.  If you are feeling a little bit more adventurous, I recommend the cabeza (beef head) tacos or the lengua (beef tongue) tacos, both flavorful as well.  4 tacos plus a drink is about $11.  You should definitely come here and enjoy some amazing tacos; I couldn't recommend this place enough!",

    "text": "This location used to be a gas station and it's away from the Strip.  They do have a Tacos el Gordo on the Strip somewhere but I chose this one instead.  Totally worth the drive if you want some good tacos and less people.  I was able to find parking right away, unlike the one in San Diego.   Once you get inside, you have to get in different lines for beef, pork or others and place your order.  Then you go in another line and pay there.  It's kinda confusing actually unless you read the Yelp reviews or you've been to one before.  I've only had the carne asada tacos (which was pretty good) and the adobada tacos (my fave).  Don't forget to ask for pineapples.  It goes very well with the adobada tacos.  The tortillas were freshly made and yummy as well.  I wished they would open one in the OC area.  Hehe...  Expect long lines.  These people work very hard so please tip them in the jar if you can.  I know I wouldn't be able to work at a busy place like this, standing for a long time and chopping up the meats.  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas.",

These tacos are undeniably the best in town! Honestly, I cannot wait to try the ones down on the strip because, with the amount of people waiting in line at 3 AM, it must be amazing! This location leaves nothing to the imagination! All the food and employees leave NOTHING to be desired. That is a real rarity. This is True Mexican tacos in Las Vegas as it should be... never to be ignored. If you are on the north side of town this is the definite pit stop!!! I had the spicy pork adobata and I'm not sure I'll waver from that  any time soon.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo is not bad, but there are other places in town, in my experience, that are better for authentic street tacos (e.g., Tacos Y Tacos and Tacos Tijuana - both on S. Pecos).  I went there for lunch around 12pm on a week day and it was extremely busy. It's basically located in a gas station/truck stop. That seems good to me though. It seems more authentic. I ordered the tacos el pastor. However, the tacos were pretty bland to be honest. The flavor was really lacking. I don't know what it was, maybe they had an off day, but I feel other street taco places have bolder seasoning in the meat and sauces. Also, the accoutrements - salsa, pickled jalapenos, onions, cilantro and things seemed old and were all soggy, dried up and/or wrinkled. Not good when you have a busy lunch crowd.  They have a pretty large dining space, so you can probably always get a seat but I was not knocked off my feet by this place. But in a pinch, it's better than a lot of other places in the area.",

I asked the lady what kind of salsa she had and she said red or green. I asked her what kind of red salsa... Tomato or taquera and she just handed me the salsa and ignored me.

You can find me in the Al pastor, carne asada and the suadero lines The lines here generally move pretty quickly, unless you come during rush hour, then it slows down a bit, and when that happens, if you have to go to multiple lines, it can really slow you down. A good TEG pro tip if you're in this situation is to get in one line, and whoever you're with can wait in the other one They are pretty generous with the meat on the tacos. They are very generous with the carne asada fries. Like they just pile up everything on those fries, so thank you sweet baby Jesus.  They come with the standard juice drinks: pina, horchata, Jamaica. They are also one of the few places in town that I can get orange bang  The only issue I had with this place is that the first month or two that it was open, they only had half the seat in area available, and that basically killed any chance of me eating there and not taking it home, but recently they I'd open it fully, so I'm much grateful for that.

Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an \"Adobada Taco\" ($2) and an \"Adobada Mulas\" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!",

I would've tipped the cooks big because I work for tips but with that bad attitude i just wanted to leave. Came home to my food with very little meat on my tacos & nothing else on them, when I really wanted everything. The cook even asked me if I wanted everything and I said yes.. Smh really disappointed. The Charleston location wouldn't do this to me on their busiest day.",

Go stand in usually the biggest line because thats where the good stuff is at.  Skip the asada (this ain't amateur hour). Then go see the lady about some roasted chili peppers and green onions.  Get yourself some limes, radishes, and an horchata.  Sit down and indulge in the best tacos in Las Vegas.  Enjoy.",

I wanted to try a variety of what they offered, so I ordered the Vampiro with al pastor, carne asada taco, al pastor taco and an al pastor Mula. Everything I ordered tasted amazing. I highly recommend this place, just make sure you get there on a not so empty stomach because the wait time is  quite a while, but most definitely worth it! And make sure you stand in the line according to the meat that you want. There are different lines for the different types of meats. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!",

Now wait no more.. hop off the 15 and come step into the ring with Northtown's new Taco Champion! Tacos El Gordo is simply the best taco in the Valley.  El Gordo tacos are flavorful street tacos that will run you only $2 bucks a pop! You have your choice of meats which include asada, chorizo, adobada, suadero,buche, lengua, tripa, & sesos . You can get everything on it which includes onions, and a red & green sauce. The corn tortillas are made fresh right before your eyes. Flour is also an option.  This is a popular joint that always packs a crowd. One thing to be aware of is that you can only order certain meats in certain lines. Look for the sign before you commit to a line. This can be a little confusing on your first visit. Once in line it's kind of fun to see how they prepare the tacos with swift precision and relentless repetition.   Parking is a little tight and the lines are long at El Gordo, but it's worth the wait. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",

Meat is dry, super thin, it's like their using palomia meat instead of the appropriate ranchera meat  The other tacos are good but in my opinion over priced.",

The tacos are well worth the 1 hr wait, but the waiting in a second line to pay for them kills the experience. By the time you sit down,  your food is cold. At el gordo in Chula Vista CA, once you've eaten your first round, you can always ask one of the nice ladies cleaning the tables to bring you another round while you pay for it. But here in Vegas you ask for that favor and they look at you like you're insane. I go during the week now so I can get my food in a timely manner. Their best meat is the adobada but you need to go after 6 pm to eat it off the \"trompo\". Anytime before that and they will give you reheated meat from the day before.",

My husband and I stopped in about 2 weeks ago. Having never been there we didn't understand how it worked. The cashier didn't explain to us that we had to order from the cooks then bring it to her to pay. So we ordered from her first and then stood their until one of the cooks called us over and rudely pointed to the sign saying \"what you want?\" I said \"Carne Asada tacos please\" and said \"look...look\" and tapped on the sign above him. I get that maybe he doesn't speak English but it didn't seem like he was even trying to be friendly. Once we finally figured out what we needed to do we got our tacos and carne Asada fries. The tacos were amazing. But the fries were meh. We wouldn't order them again but definitely the tacos.",

    "text": "This eatery is located off interstate 15 freeway. This eatery is located within a small location and a gas station nearby. The location itself is bright pink from the outside so it is not hard to miss.  Upon entering, the line to order was not long, but the employees did not acknowledge you as their customers entered the establishment. Furthermore, upon deciding on the type of tacos one desired, one is to get in one of the three lines which do vary depending on the type of meat you would like on your tacos.  While getting in line, I looked around and noticed there was napkins on the floor with employees near by, but doing other tasks rather than picking them up.   Upon ordering some adobada tacos, they were slices once off the meat product, but not re-sliced into smaller portions. I asked the employee to slice it into smaller pieces and he mentioned, there was not enough time for that as others behind me were waiting. I thought automatically, where is the customer service?   The adobada pieces were long strips instead of thin smaller pieces of meat thus, making the food easier to digest.  Most places cut the meat into smaller portions so the meat is digestible.  I ordered two adobada tacos and one carne asada.   They have a carrot station set up with chilles too and limes, but no salsa. If one desires salsa, they have to ask for it at the cashier counter.   The salsa is free.   After ordering your food, you head to the paying area with a cashier.  They accept credit cards including American Express.   The place overall looked like a cafeteria style set up. The tables were not very clean and the eating area around the eatery was not clean.   I don't consider this place to be a location to go out of your way for as I did from north Las Vegas, but at least I gave them a chance.   Their prices are $2.00 per taco. Most of their tacos are $2.00 each with some $2.25.",

The lines can be long since everyone else wants some of this goodness too. Seating inside right now is limited but it looks like they are making more room for seating so that's good. What I'm hoping is that they get more stations going to help with the lines. Tacos are $2 and come with onions, cilantro, and sauce unless you specify otherwise. I ask that mine be made on flour tortillas and they do it and don't even charge extra. You can get a side of free grilled veggies upon asking too. Really good food at good prices.",

One line is pork cooked middle eastern way, as standing up open flame. The locals get pineapple ask for it. They don't give it otherwise.  Try the tongue or Chorizo it's really tasty.  Then you Que up, stand in another line to pay.  They trust you will not run away with your food. It's a Mexican concept of honor and class. The thought is you will pay, sometimes after you eat. El Gordo is pay and get your drinks.  Again most of the locations are not high end, this is authentic Mexican style street food served in a causal food environment.

I politely told her slow ass I repeated it 10xs it's not my fault your English or comprehension skills are lacking. I'm beyond pissed now.

There are other protein choices like adobada, lengua, chorizo, etc. They also have nopales for those wanting a vegetarian option. The tacos come served on small corn tortillas but you can ask for flour if you prefer. You also have the option of ordering sopes, tostadas, mulas, or vampiros (like a mini tostada but with melted cheese topped with another crispy tostada).   If you go for lunch, be prepared for the long lines and do yourself a favor and bring a buddy to help you hunt for a table while you order.",

If you don't try one of these make sure that you leap off the top of the stratosphere afterwards. Mind blowing good.  The ladies at the register are always very sweet and quick and the guys behind the counter making the tacos are unbelievably fast. I've never tried anything but the tacos here but I could imagine the fries covered with this meat or any of the others would be phenomenal. Don't try the location on Las Vegas Blvd. In my opinion you're just going to get a lot of the local strip traffic and a short drive if you are in North Vegas is well worth lines of people who don't quite know what they want.  This place is a staple of every Vegas trip I make.  Great for after clubs too.",

We decided to stop by this location on our way out of town and it was just as good! There are 3 separate lines for different types of meat so be sure to check the signs before you line up! I usually decide what I want first then wait in one line while my friend waits in another so we don't have to wait in line twice.  My favorite is the al pastor taco! The meat is so good and it's topped with a sauce that compliments the meat really well. I also like the carne asada (steak) and lengua (beef tongue)! There are complimentary limes and radishes in a salad bar on the side! I like to squeeze a ton of lime on my tacos. They also have aguas frescas! My go-to flavor is the jamaica (hibiscus). So good!",

Located on the NE corner of Cheyenne and Losee, and beside the I-15. Its a convenient location for those who live on this side of town or are in the area.   The restaurant itself, design is a bit different from the other two that are in town. Upon entry, to the left is where you get the food, to the right is where all the seating is at. Of course to the left, there are some seating areas as well. More seating in comparison to Charleston. MUCH less busy than both of them. I came here on a Wednesday early afternoon, granted the weather wasnt all that great, gloomy, but the skies didnt crack open yet (it cracked open like an hour later). \"Windows\", there are very limited amounts. If anything, it may be less than even the Charleston location.  Decided to get some fries and tacos this time. Small adobada fries, a lengua taco, and a buche taco. The fries were freshly fried upon order and an ample amount of the juicy, fatty adobada meat was sliced off the spindle. The tacos were made to a \"window\" over during the time the fries were being made. Everything looked great ! I paid for my food and decided to eat in my car and while snack on while driving. Meat flavor wise, seemed to be a bit lacking and underwhelming. Even the adobada meat, all i could really taste was a mild sweetness and fattiness.   Overall, still a good location though. Wish they'd open one on the west side of town. Closest i got is the one on the strip T_T",

It took me a while to come visit this location, though, I'm not quite sure why.  I think the only thing I have an issue with is the set up of the place. I know they are pretty known for it and not that many people really care about the setup but I just hate going into one line for carne asada and then having to go into another line for the spicy pork.  But boy do I love the spicy pork tacos with everything especially that guac on top. I always ask for extra. BOMB. and then you can ask for chili and onions on the side, oh so good and spicy! I also get the carne asada fries half not full because the half is like already big enough anyway. I love how it just taste so authentic. The staff could be a little nicer but they aren't necessarily mean but could smile a bit more.  I also LOVE that their fountain drinks consist of Mexican drinks like Horchata or that Pina juice. BOMB. and its free refills!   Quick tip, if you need green or red salsa ask the cashier. It took me a while to figure out where i can get salsa from because usually they just have it out and it's a serve yourself type of thing but not here. It is kinda good though because then the salsa doesn't get infested with random things if its just out there in the open.  love this place. will be back for sure.",

    "text": "This is my hubby's favorite taco place and avoiding the strip's location is probably the best since it could be an hour or two wait. We tried probably everything on the menu since we've been going for a few years now. I never ever posted a review and I should have sooner. I love this location because you have plenty of seating. They have one side where you order, another side which has a lot of tables and booths plus outdoor seating! If you want to enjoy your Tacos happily with no hassle to ever find a place to sit, sacrifice a few more dollars just for an Uber/Lyft ride to this location. I know a lot of people travel to enjoy food and have fun. So my travel foodies, go to this location! :) The best thing they have is probably the pastor (hand carved in front of you). I'm making this review on behalf of my hubby too lol. He always orders Adobada Fries. Sometimes half adobada and half asada. I am the buche and the seso type person. It might sound scary to some but that's some good sh****! LOL! Best sesos Tacos I've had! The fries are always golden brown and delicious. You can always ask for sauce on the side of you don't want it on your tacos. They have grilled onions and jalapenos for you to enjoy with it. You just have to ask for it. You should! I love it! Nothing better then a kick with every bite of your food. Happy eating my fellow foodies!!",

The line was long, but the wait was always worth it. Sadly, this location let me down. The  flavor was definitely lacking compared to the original location. There was something missing, and my meat was kind of dry. We also tried the fries, which were new. They weren't that great, and I wouldn't suggest getting it.   If you've never been to the location in SD, then you can't compare it. But if you think these tacos were amazing, go to the original if you get a chance and you'll be blown away.",

We also tried the mula with carne asada and that was pretty good. It was crowded both times we came here but it's worth the wait.

The al pastor meat line is always the longest, and then people from the other meat lines, think they can jump in front of the al pastor line cause they waited in one (of the shortest) line already. So annoying. I think if you know you're going to get al pastor and (for example) carne asada as well, you should wait in the longest most popular line first, then make your way to the smaller lines, right???...you would think that would be common sense.

He would definitely rate this place high.   You walk in to a room full of people waiting in lines. There are 3 different lines depending on what kind of meat you want. So you stand in one line and hope they can sneak some meat from the line next to you if you want another type of meat. They are  fast enough but you do sometimes have to wait for people to make up their darn minds.   My only gripe is that they don't have a salsa bar. So if you forgot to ask for salsa before you left the line, you are screwed because no one will let you back in. Overall an authentic taco place for real Mexican tacos.",

    "text": "Amazing like always.  Not American tacos, REAL tacos!  Like everyone is mentioning, keep a close eye on which line you wait in.  Secondly, have patience while they prepare your food.  If you want something faster, go elsewhere.  One of the biggest things to note is you must ask for salsa while you order.  Otherwise there is no salsa bar.  So is it worth the trip to leave the strip to visit this place for food?  OF COURSE IT IS!!  Always remind yourself, there is both good and great food on and off the strip.  What is always for sure is that whatever you get on the strip will be more expensive.  Nevertheless, Tacos El Gordo keeps it real by giving you food without the Vegas hassle.",

I haven't branched out and tried the other meats but maybe one day haha   also it's a very clean looking facility. I've been the old location on the strip and that seemed so dirty. not this place! the employees are very quick to clean up after you get up from your table.   this place is pretty awesome for when you wanna make a quick taco run!",

I lived in San Diego, where legit Mexican food exists. After moving to Vegas, I needed to find my go-to taco shop. Tacos El Gordo is hands down one of the best tacos I've ever had! Yes, they're a bit pricey for tacos, but they are bomb so it's all good.  Adobada tacos are amazing, the meat is so tasty and the toppings (guac mayo!) combined just make it heaven in my mouth. I usually order three, but I can probably two more if I want to be a fatty. Campechana fries are also a must- half adobada/half carne asada. *Drools*  Only thing is that they are stingy with the salsa. They keep it in a fridge behind the cashier, and you'll go over there with all your tacos and full order of fries and they'll give you one measly cup. I'm usually like, \"Can I have 3 more?\" and they're good about it.",

Most of the staff is very friendly and they do try to keep the place clean.  But there is this a-hole that work the al pastor how is extremely rude. I think his name is Javier but in not sure.  He is a light skin,  bigger set man who is always there upwards the night time. He has been rude before but we thought it was just stress due to how buzzy this place gets so we let it slide.  But this last time was the final straw. We took out of town people to try this place.  We get there and they make us wait 25 minutes because the al pastor has to cook. Okay,  time to place our order.  We ask for 18 tacos and he starts prepping them. Once he is half way we all for 2 mulitas. He looks at us and says why didn't you say earlier.  Well we didn't want to get him confused because he has a tenancy of doing that and we told him.  He start going off staying that he won't get confused cause he has 30 years in tacos and he won't make mistakes (really a-hole cause your track record states otherwise). So we tell him we don't care and we need our 2 mulitas. Mind you he doesn't even cook them.  The order is place with him and someone else from the back comes and makes them.  So why he got all rude is ridiculous. Needless to say I'm not coming here anymore. I rather go to the Charleston location.  I never had rude service there.",

I'm not saying the Horchata is the best but it sure does compliment their delicious food. My poison is the mulas with handmade corn tortillas. It's like Mexican version of a burger. Make sure you have plenty of napkins because they eat a little messy but the flavor can't be beat.
