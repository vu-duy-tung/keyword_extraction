We ordered the garbage can brisket nachos and the sauce and brisket were great! That appetizer was gone in no time at all with our family of five. We ordered the mac and cheese bacon burger, original burger, motley que sandwich, and the Asian lettuce wraps for entrees. The burgers had a great char and all sandwiches had delicious sauce. Be ready to wash your hands after, because the sandwiches and burgers are very messy! The Asian lettuce wraps were good, but the burgers and sandwiches are definitely the specialties!",

But much to our disappointment the we were quickly unimpressed.   This review is not based on the food, because we simply never even made it to our table, due to the fact we were never seated. This particular Friday afternoon we walked in around 1pm stood in a quickly moving line gave the hostess my boyfriends name & the first available seating is fine with us. She proceeded to tell us it should be a short wait and to stand off to the side; which we did, but quickly we started noticing the people standing behind us in line we're getting called first and seated, even bigger parties with longer wait times were seated right away as we stood next to the host station waiting .... and waiting and yes you guessed it waiting some more.......  it got to the point we just said it wasn't worth the wait after 15 mins of watching everyone else who came after us being seated we left as we saw three hostess standing around talking story and not seating the only two people waiting for a table. We said enough was enough, the food could've been mediocre for all we care, but service is what keeps people coming back and clearly Guy Fiere's establishment had no such exceptional service.",

For dessert we split the fried ice cream - OMG was that good, kids want to go back again just for the dessert.  Portions are large.  Also our server was really good, even though she was busy with many tables.  The prices are on the high end, $20 for a burger, but your on the Vegas strip and all prices are inflated.  We sat outside which is noisy but fun.  I highly recommend.",

Second time we went had to wait forever and when we finally got seated (got passed up several times) they switched to a different menu which didn't have what we wanted so we left. Worth a visit.

In Vegas to relax, thought this would be relaxing. 2 couples arrived early and put our name in and waited at bar. We arrive, and find them at bar. We say hello and begin to talk and socialize. With bar full, myself and long time friend begin talking about business.  Leaning against wall, here comes manager to tell us we can't stand around bar. That the isle way has to be clear. So to help I squeeze in next to my wife, doing so I'm told I need to wait at front door there isn't enough room!  So I ask him, it's a bar and their is a area around folks can't stand???? He proceeds to tell me yeah! I'm honestly amazed that a person with such people skills is in a management position.  So walking back to hostess stand to \"wait\" as my friends socialize I see a door into the kitchen big enough to drive truck through.....  At this point I realize.... what a no class place this is.  Hope this review shows Guy what management his restaurant has working here. One that has -0- people skills to deal with customers or provide a great experience to patrons.",

I paid 45$ for an over cooked hamburger and dry CRISPY pastrami and 1 cocktail. It tasted like it had been sitting for 1/2 hour at the window under heat lamps. The waiter never came back to ask us how everything was. Guy Fiery should be ashamed of the quality that the kitchen puts out. We will spread the word that this is not a good place to go!! Save your money and eat at the In and Out next door. At least it's cheaper and you know what you're getting.",

    "text": "When you think of Guy Fieri, I bet you instantly think of his hit television show 'Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives' (one of my favorite shows by the way). Now think of taking his hit show and making it into an actual restaurant you can eat at while visiting one of the best cities in the world. This restaurant of your dreams exists and it just so happens to be located in Las Vegas, NV at The Linq Hotel & Casino.  Not if but when you decide to visit Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar one dish you need to try is the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. This dish consist of pepperoni-wrapped pretzels served with a smoky melted  provolone and italian pork sausage cheese dip, topped with fresh diced tomato and basil. It is best paired with Guinness Stout. I am a huge 'dip anything into melted cheese' fan so this dish was right up my alley! The cheese is smooth and rich and you got pepperoni in almost every single bite! As long as you don't mind you and your other guests double dipping then this dish is definitely a priority.  When it comes to dessert I love anything chocolate. So we ordered the Triple-Double Mint Pie. Dear God, all you mint chocolate chip fans are in for a serious mind blow. This dish consist of a giant humungous serving of mint chocolate chip ice cream, oreo cookies stuck all over it, mint candies and hot fudge poured over the entire thing. Big enough for like a million people I swear this desert was insane ..... ly good! LOL! :) A must try!  Every dish I had here has been amazing but those two stuck out in my mind the most. Make sure to visit Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar and at least try these 2 meals. I only hope you enjoy them as much as I did!  Thank you Guy Fieri for traveling the country and bringing such amazing dishes to us here in Sin City!

I unfortunately wasn't impressed with what was on here seemed like your cliche burger joint with some fancy wording. I will give them, presentation was amazing of all foods but nothing out of this world. Had the nachos and the meat was slightly undercooked which lead to a slight upset stomach. Drinks were small but tasty. If your visiting and love the show, check it out for the photo opportunity.",

I assume they're understaffed because after sitting at a table it took about 15 minutes before anyone asked us for a drink order.  The menu is very fun and different. The presentation is great and I love the silverware. I'm sure on a good day, when the food and service are up to par with what I'm sure Guy Fieri expects every day, that the food would be good.  But $18 and the service was slow and burgers cold? It's the strip, you should be prepared to serve a lot of people.  I'm sorry, serving out cold food is just unacceptable to me.",

    "text": "Okay, okay. I will admit it, I really like the show triple D. I've heard a lot of things about guy fieri restaurants and it seems that most people are right in saying that it's mostly a smoke and mirror thing, with gargantuan portions.  I had the dragon's breath chili Benedict with a Bloody Mary and my husband had the steak and eggs with a mimosa.   The Pros: we had a 20% off coupon for staying at harrahs, so that was a big bonus because certain things seemed relatively expensive.  The cornbread was really delicious, more like a cake. It wasn't heavy like you might expect. They poach the eggs by hand and not with those stupid egg poacher things, which makes a HUGE taste difference and I have a lot of respect for the care that goes into that. The real standouts of the meal were the Bloody Mary, and the crispy home fries. Oh. My. Goodness. If you get nothing else, GET THE HOME FRIES.   Cons:  Other than that, the chili was meh, and I am SO thankful I got the cheese sauce on the side because it was basically super gloopy Mac and cheese sauce. I think it was sitting for a while because it had a film over the top. The steak, while almost cooked to perfection(almost is he key here, it was closer to M/MW rather than MR) was overseasoned. But that might be because I tend to be a purist about steaks. Salt, pepper, butter for such a good cut. The eggs, while poached very well, weren't seasoned. My husband's scrambled eggs weren't seasoned either.   Overall, there are a lot of good restaurants in Vegas, I am glad I went but I probably won't come back.",

    "text": "We had pretty high expectations seeing as though we're big Guy fans and really loved his restaurant in Santa Rosa.   We stumbled in on Valentine's Day around 3pm as we were traipsing around Vegas. We knew we wouldn't be able to get in anywhere else on Valentine's Day any later in the evening, so when we were told that it would only be a 10-15 minute wait, we went for it.  We weren't super hungry, so we opted for just drinks and a couple apps. We got the fondue dippers, fireball whisky wings, & the Caesar salad which comes in a giant crouton.  The service was okay. There were a few times when I would have liked a refill and there was nobody, but they came eventually.  The food was also only ok.  The fondue dippers were okay in my book, but my husband didn't really care for them and only ate one. The pepperoni on them was a bit waxy, but the cheese dip was good I thought. We ate about half the app.  The salad looked cooler than anything else. The giant crouton ring was awesome, but it wasn't super flavorful. The dressing was okay.  The fireball whisky wings were definitely the best part of the meal. They were cut into lollipops which I enjoy if I have to have wings with bones (I'm a boneless fan) and the sauce was delicious. It was spicy and sweet at the same time. I would definitely enjoy having those again, but I could leave the rest.  I would be interested in trying the mac n' cheese burger since it won best burger in Vegas and looked great, but other than that and those wings, I don't think I'd order anything else.   Sorry Guy! Still love ya!",

    "text": "When in Vegas one must try the food at restaurants with celebrity names attached to them. After landing I really wanted to get a burger and ended up going to Guy Fieri's restaurant for a good burger. I heard about this place from a YouTube video on the subject of Vegas burger joints and it mentioned this place and what got my attention was when I heard them say Bacon Mac and Cheese Burger! I was interested and ordered that here. Seeing the restaurant from the outside, it is in the corner of a building along the strip and it looked like a Cowboy themed joint. The inside fits the theme pretty well too, with the dark wood look and the overall color if the place, it gave off a saloon like ambience. But at the same time it wasn't completely cowboy themed with the various random Vegas pics along the walls and brightly colored seats. Now as for the famous Bacon Mac-N-cheese Burger I was disappointed. The burger seemed smaller than I expected and when it was brought up to me I was thinking to myself where is the Mac-N-cheese? I then popped off the top and saw a small amount of Mac-N-cheese. But thinking to myself I just shrugged it off and said well maybe it tastes great. After a few bites I was thinking to myself I actually paid $21 for this? It was an ok burger but not worth that price point! The fries however were good, they were well seasoned, cooked perfectly and I love how they give you a variety of fries too, a mix of waffle fries, crinkle cut fries, and standard fries. Overall the meal was nice but honestly a visit here is more for that novelty experience than for an actual dining experience.",

I went there about 4 pm there weren't many people but my drinks took about 20 minutes to get to the table, after that food arrive in 25 minutes . Me and my family weren't finish with the food and the waitress came to use us if we were finished having plates halfway, one minute after  waitress another waitress came trying to remove our plates still been halfway, but she also had the receipt on her hand that anyways she left on the table. We felt so unwelcome maybe cause we look so wetback in a Caucasian servers world. Any ways bad experience beside food all that food felt and look like someone else's leftover food. DON'T  take me wrong me and my family love guy Fieri's show, one of the best shows ever, he gives you hints of where u can eat. Guy: keep an eye in your spots cause your great name is behind your restaurant. Because this bad experience I will be visiting his restaurant in Santa Rosa CA. Hopefully this is not the way they are trained",

Prices are a little steep, but you're on the Vegas strip so you can't really expect less. What makes up for it though is the massive portions! Great for meal sharing or sharing with a group.  I walked in with my group without making a reservation and waited about 15 minutes. Staff was very attentive and helpful. Very friendly.   I recommend the Trashcan Nachos. May sound weird, but it tastes bomb!!",

Next we ordered the \"Vegas Fries\" for $14.50. Omg, these were my favorite! The waitress told me they were spicy but I didn't agree with that at all! They are perfectly crunchy on the outside, served with great sauces and I can't wait to have these again! The \"Banana French Toast\" for $15 was good just super sweet! My husband had the \"Original Burger\" for $22.50 because he added bacon. Overall my server Brooke was so sweet!  Not a long wait for good quality food and service! I will absolutely have this again on my next visit.",

The Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger plus waffle fries was ordered. It took about 25 minutes to make, which I guess isn't a terribly long time, but when you're just standing, waiting in the restaurant, it feels like an eternity.   Finally we got our bag of food and got out of there... When we finally tore open the bag about 10-15 minutes later, a BBQ/SMOKEY AROMA filled the air... And instantly my husband and I recognized the scent but we couldn't put our name on it until I put a fry up to my nose and inhaled deeply.   BBQ DORITOS.  I hate BBQ DORITOS... And so does my husband.  Uh. Oh.   So yeah, the fries, not wonderful but good enough to eat (or perhaps we were just hungry enough that we didn't care?). As for the burger... Despite the Mac & Cheese and Bacon, it was bland and dry... it needed salt, thus it was added... And desperately needed ketchup which was later found at the bottom of the bag AFTER the burger was finished.   As you can see, despite hearing good things about Guy Fieri's Restaurant, it fell short of impressing us... And I later found out my Vegas-Resident friend absolutely hates Guy's restaurant. WHOOPS.   Won't be making that mistake again.",

You see, I was spoiled by your burgers on my Carnival Cruise...I would have committed murder for those burgers, honestly the best I'd ever had. So I was really looking forward to trying out your spot on the Strip!  I ordered the shrimp appetizer with the Thai sweet chili sauce. The bacon wrapped around the shrimp was chewy, and the shrimp were way too big for my taste. I guess I like smaller shrimp that I can eat in one bite. The waitress didn't even ask if I wanted a to-go box to take the rest of the shrimp with me, but maybe she knows how bad it is? I got the turkey burger. It is enormous. I had to eat the patty with a knife and fork before I could pick it up to eat it. The patty by itself was actually really good, and I'm a condiment queen so that's saying something. The Gouda cheese didn't really melt on the patty, and I didn't get any pepper jack on my burger like the menu stated. It's was edible, nonetheless, I just wish I could have eaten it like a burger rather than dissect it and make a mess with it.  It's disappointing to say that I liked the fries the most out of all the food I ate. Yikes! I'll stick with eating your burgers on the cruise ships!",

It was warm, inviting, and the staff were BOMB! I had a drink in my hand as we were being seated and they have a place for you to leave your drink (not allowed in restaurant because they want you to buy their own booze). I found this to be a really nice touch. We tried five of their signature drinks (two margaritas and three others)...everything was wonderful. For appetizers we ordered the ahi tacos and the jalapeno poppers. They were great starters for our table. My husband had the mac n cheese burger, and our friend had the Kobe burger. Both of them were very happy and ate every last bite. I ordered the chicken wings. I think this was the only klunker at the table. Not because the wings were bad...but for the price $18.95, I didn't think there was enough food! Also, I ordered a side of fries and that was an additional $5. For $23.95 fries & 7 wings is ridiculous. They weren't hot enough either, but the blue cheese/wasabi dip was FANTASTIC. I asked for another helping of that...really good. So for three hours of chit chatting, drinking, and tons of food - I'd highly recommend this place. It's a big expensive, but it's on The Strip and you're on vacation!",

When I arrived, there was people piling up in the waiting area... the hostess asked if I want to sit at the bar with no waiting... so I did.  The bartender was quick, attentive, knowledgeable about the food and very kind.  My appetizer came out quickly (fondue) and OH MY GOSH!!!! It was amazing in flavor and plentiful... I shared some with my fellow bar patrons because they wanted to know how it was....  Amidst all the loud restaurant noise and TV screens, the bartender checked back frequently and always with a smile.  Then the main course: the big dipper... Now this one is a bit difficult for me... It was big! It had a pile of meat ( but the meat was under seasoned) with cheese and onions... The hoagie was cut disproportionately so it was hard to grab the sandwich and actually dip in the au jus (also bland)... the horseradish cream was a nice intended touch... but it was At best 5% horseradish and the rest was cream. If you're going to dilute it that much and serve on side of a bland sandwich...then call it cream with horseradish...   However, service was great.   I used some of my fondue for my sandwich (which worked out really really well) and I left a happy customer. Thanks to the bartender that kept his smile and amazing service this restaurant still gets 4 stars from me:)",

This last time we visited we decided to try 2 of the sandwiches, pork shoulder and the steak. Usually we leave with a full belly and hardly able to walk cause we are so full from licking our plate clean but this time the food was blah. The steak was a bit chewy so I pretty much ate the bread and veggies and my boyfriend said the pork just had a funny taste. I ordered a salad which was brought out the same time as the rest of our order : / Service was blah.... our server checked up on us once. Didn't have much personality. Basically just took the order and dropped off the check.

It's got your name on it, you should take some pride in it and do something about \"famous food that just falls flat\" you have a show going around the country boasting their accomplishments all the while yours in Vegas misses the mark.  To be honest I wish I had my $$ back or had gone to In & Out right across the way and saved 79 bucks",

My food was great, waitress did not come to our table until after we finished our food and that is was when things went sideways.    The couple we were with are vegan.  We were talking about how hard it is to find vegan food that is tasteful.  One of them ordered what looked like a burrito with guacamole on the side.  So when the waitress made it to our table, everyone had finished eating.    She asked how the food was, so the only complaint was the burrito.  It wasn't what he expected.  She asked us twice if we wanted to talk with the manager.  He finally said yes.  Worst mistake he could have made!!!!!!  The manager showed up!  He was RUDE!  He came to the table, reached across my friend's wife only to ask him why he ate half of it.  The truth is we were hungry, and it wasn't until we were done that the waitress showed up at the table.  The manager took the plate, then looked at me and said what about you?  I was not even a part of the conversation, just an observer.  There was no reason for him to be so rude to me.  When the waitress returned, we were told that he took 20% off our bill.  So now of course we are all wondering how a manager can treat customers so rudely.  My friend asked if there was another manger, we were told yes only to have the same guy come to the table.  He went straight for my friend put his hand on my friend's shoulder to tell him he can go eat somewhere else.  There was no reason for him to have put his hands on him.  He was lucky he did not get hit.  So when I saw that, I got the manager's attention by pointing out the fact that he came to the table initially with an attitude, and that he was rude to me.  I was shocked that he acknowledged that he did have an attitude, because he was going to protect his employee.  From what, we had no idea.  He was the aggressor in all of this.  We hadn't asked for a manager in the first place, the waitress insisted that he come to the table.   Looking at the comments, bland food is not uncommon comments. So why get so upset?  We left there feeling singled because we were black.  Basically my friend was threatening because he was a black male complaining about a burrito.  I have never been treated so poorly.  There are plenty of other places to get a burger.  So clearly I would not suggest this place to anyone.  EVER!!!!",

    "text": "I was not a fan of Guy Fieri's spot at the Linq.  Wait times were very long, service was sub par, and worst of all, our overpriced bar food was not good.  I did enjoy the look of this restaurant and the table settings, but unfortunately, that was about it.  After about an hour wait, we were seated at a two-top and waited approx.15 minutes for anyone to stop at our table.  A gentleman took our drink order and advised that our waitress, Erica, would be over shortly.  Our drinks came about 7 or 8 minutes later, but Erica did not materialize for 15 minutes.  We ordered our appetizer and entrees from Erica, who acted very annoyed to be there.  After almost 2 hours of wait time since arrival, I expected our food to be pretty good, but I was less than impressed.  Appetizer: Fondue Dippers- $14- 1/5- Pepperoni-wrapped Pretzels with a provolone fondue.  Super Salty.  We were expecting warm, soft pretzels, however these were just very stale salted snack-food pretzel rods wrapped in extremely salty pepperoni accompanied by a bowl of flavorless melted cheese.  Inedible Fail.  Entrees:   Big Dipper- $19- 1/5- Supposedly a Philly Cheesesteak, this sandwich contained fatty, greasy, bland meat, topped by greasy cheese.  One bite of this sandwich were enough for me.  The waffle fries would have probably been fine if they were not aggressively coated with what tasted like BBQ chip flavoring that made them too salty to eat. Double Fail.  Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger: $20- 2/5- A bacon cheeseburger topped with a scoop of macaroni and cheese.  The quality of the meat was once again an issue with this burger.  It just was not very good.  Cocktails:  Austin Sweet Tea: $14- 3/5- Deep eddy sweet tea vodka, peach schnapps, lemon juice.  Although this drink was tasty it was a little too sweet for me.  Crazy Hagar: $14- 3/5- Sammy's beach bar rum, mint, lime juice, & cherry ale.  I enjoyed the fresh mint leaves in this cocktail.  Both of these drinks were mostly ice, so I consider them very overpriced at $14 ea.  In conclusion, this will be our one and only visit to Guy Fieri's at the Linq.  I leave it for the tourists.",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed!  My husband and I tried this place out because we were told it was good. Unfortunately I would not agree.  We arrived and waited about 15 minutes to get seated.  Then we ordered drinks and decided to just place our food order.  We ordered a chopped caesar salad and the motley pulled pork.  Well we got our drinks and after that didn't see our waitress Mandy.  As we sat waiting for our food.  Other guests were being seated and their orders were being taken some by our waitress.    30 minutes later we still don't have our food but the people behind us and in front if us who got seated after us had their food.  But we didn't.  So Mandy finally decided to come over and say sorry your food is taking so long would you like another drink.  Then I said to her how come the other guests that came after us have their food and we don't?  She then said I will go check and see.  At this point its been 45 mins.  She walks to the kitchen picks our food. Unfortunately it was the wrong  sandwich!  She then takes it back and returns with our sandwich.  Didn't make sense.  Her excuse was that the runner was behind.  But the kitchen is open to the public and we could clearly see there were not many plates there.  Plus the runner was definitely running the food because everyone after us had there food but us.  The  chopped Caesar salad was just the whole leaves and the salad was dry.  We had to cut it up ourselves.  It wasn't until this that Mandy started checking in on us much more often.  She unfortunately didn't seem to get it that we were unhappy with the service.    Unfortunately I would not recommend this place and I was extremely unhappy.    Guy u might want to follow up at this location.  From the looms of it I am not the only u happy customer.",

    "text": "What a gigantic disappointment to say the least!  First I can't believe the fire department allowed the single entry/exit. It is tight for 2 people to get by let alone exit in an emergency.  Now for the food and service    Okay when you order a $20 burger it better be fantastic. Fortunately my wife and me decided to order a burger and split it. I can say this the single worst burger we ever had. A very small plate with dry bread with a burger slapped in it and nothing else. There was another plate with a bit of shredded lettuce a poor excuse for a tomato with a few thinly sliced onions. Under all of that was a, literally cold and soggy, onion ring so wet with grease it could not be eaten.   I had water and my wife had a beer.   While I like Guy very much I am very disappointed with his quality control, food presentation and the temperature of what is being served. With all due respect Guy, take a few lessons from those restaurants you visit and tape. You say you're going to use some of which you taste...it's time to do that. Given that resource, we thought we were in for a real burger.    We have visited other restaurants of yours one specifically Tex Wasabi in Sacramento which I see is gone.   IMHO give a pass on this one, save the $32 bill and move on.",

I love the show and my thought Guy knows food so this will be good.  1st Meal- The Motley Que Sandwich  The pork was dry and the sauce was overly sweet and extremely  Extremely salty.    After my order arrived i looked around and realized no one had finished their sandwich, i see why.. it was just not good.  Sandwiches starting at 19 I expect better.  My first thought was I ordered the wrong the thing.  The helpful bartenders recommended the  Bacon Mac n Cheese.  Ok Tomorrow lets try this again. Like i said im huge fan of his show.  2nd Meal- the next night i go back hopeful about my $21 Bacon Mac and Cheese.  The description sounds incredible.  Womp Womp Womp   Ive had better burgers at Wendys for a 3rd of the price.  They dont ask you how you want the patty cooked because its so thin you can only get it well.  The Mac n Cheese i was expecting was an ooey gooey helping that i would need a fork and lactaid pill to eat.  What i got was a dried out brick of flavorless nothing.  Im sure prison food tastes better.  The bacon was decent but that was it  Thanks for nothing GUY.  Next time I will going up the road to see what Gordon Ramsay is cooking up.  There are just way too many options in Vegas.",

Wrong, and now I am questioning everything he's ever recommended.   The breakfast options are very limited. There's only like 5 or 6 menu items offered and I wasn't crazy about most of the combinations. I ordered the chicken fried bacon which comes with a biscuit, scrambled eggs and sausage gravy and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The juice was probably the best part of my visit. It was super fresh and tasty. The gravy was greasy and bland, the eggs were average, the chicken fried bacon was gross. The bacon slice was very thick and not cooked crisp so it was very tough and chewy. The coating was coming off and wasn't very flavorful either. On top of that you only get one slice of bacon. The biscuit was also very dry and bland. I actually overheard people at other tables send their bacon back as well because it was not crisp.    The only reason this place get's two stars is because the service was great. The hostess was very nice and welcoming and my waiter was very polite.",

Humongous portions, compatable with their prices. The drinks were great. I had the mac and cheese burger (my favorite thing on earth!). Big, juicy patties with creamy mac and cheese), served with 4 kinds of fries (each with it's own spicyness, but not too spicy at all). For dessert I had the fried ice cream...oh, G-d! a gigantic ball of french vanilla ice cream fried in corn flakes with strawberry, pineapple and chocolate sauces on the plate, along with banana and peanut butter toppings, burbon sauce and whipped cream. All plated so that you can build your own bomb! All of the presentations were wonderful! Ate there again for lunch and had the pulled pork sandwich. Again...amazing! Guy,  you really outdid yourself! The only negative thing I could say is that if breakfast is going to stop serving early (which, according to the staff, the chef decides on that day), a sign should be posted outside to let people know.",

ANYWAYS, we came at about 10 at night, wait was fairly short and the staff was nice. Our waiter was okay, not too great but not crappy either. This place is extremely pricey but I was expecting that, we started off with the fondue dippers. I completely missed the part where the meat comes on the pretzel sticks so I was sort of edging away towards it. The fondue was bitter, the appetizer just wasn't spectacular. Me and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Mac N' Cheese burger. I have to give this restaurant props for not using typical Kraft since this actually looked like GOOD mac n cheese. Although, burger tastes average and I could barely tie in the mac n cheese and the burger ended up falling apart and becoming a sloppy mess. I'm a fan of Guy but not this restaurant, sigh.",

Bartender who first came up rudely informed me they were closing up the bar and indicated the plastic sheeting they were using to cover the liquor. I stated that the hostesses had indicated they were still open. She then mocked the hostesses from across the room and when I asked her if I could be served and she said yeah because the hostesses said so. Rest of service was from a second bartender who was much nicer.  Ordered their mac and cheese burger which was pretty good but obvious it was the end of the night as the lettuce was wilted and the some of the fries (mixture of four different types) were cold.  While the second bartender was nice they were cleaning around me and the whole experience felt rushed.  imagine this place could be awesome when they want you there. If you want to stop serving at 11:30 then your should adjust your hours to seating until 11:30. Manger stopped by to ask me how everything was as I was wrapping up the rest of my food to go.  While he assured me he would take to the first bartender he offered nothing in the way of a bit of the meal or a drink on the house. Guess with $20 for a burger it's not that type of place. When I told him based on the experience I wouldn't be back he told me he wished I would come back again... Not much motivation too.  Go somewhere that wants your business.",

It was an accident!!!I'm sorry but it's not just the food that makes a restaurant... It's the staff and the overall experience.  Never coming here again. She left us leaving in a bad mood and I was quite frankly not hungry anymore. I did not finish my plate...it's a shame because I was looking forward to this experience... I come from rochester ny. I work at Wegmans!  One of THE TOP 100 places to work for! Wegmans employees go out of their way EVERYDAY to make sure customers walk out with a smile on their face! No smiles here.... Never again. NEVER! Sorry Guy....",

Price- Pricey but along the same lines as the strip.  The table had an assortment of dishes that we ordered.  I asked for the best thing on the menu. I got the favorite of the house Bacon Mac and Cheese burger.  I wasnt blown away.  It was just a pretty much standard burger experience.  I wasnt asked what temperature I liked it so it was a bit overdone for my taste.  The fries were three different types.  There was a thicker one that was pretty good. They charged me 2.00 for truffle sauce.  The atmosphere was loud, it was mid day and there were a bunch of drunk obnoxious women screaming at the top of their lungs.   I wanted to be blown away but we just had a sort of meh experience.",

I really did not care for the plates.  It was hard to eat and not have your food fall off onto the table. The wait to get inside was very long, and not really worth it.  I was so hoping it would be a hit, but it really is a miss.  We are big fans of Guy's, but this unfortunately didn't hit the mark.",

    "text": "It was OK.  I got the mac n cheese bacon burger which was super messy and hard to eat! I knife and fork'ed it :p I liked the outer well-done edges of the patty (I like well-done burgers) and any bite with bacon. The rest was \"eh.\" It came with fries that tasted like barbecue chips - and I'm not much of a barbecue chips kind of person :/ My dining companion ordered their rock shrimp tacos which she finished. Either she was very hungry or she really liked them :p The portion wasn't huge though.  We got there sometime after 11am and it wasn't too busy, but it started to fill up soon after. We sat outside where it was sort of shady, sort of not, depending on where you sat. We had the outermost seating which got a little bit of sun so it felt quite hot at times in that 100 degree heat! Plus it was a bit smoky as it's so close to the Quad's open-air casino entrance. Oh, and tables were packed kind of close together. But I love outdoor seating on the Strip so I dealt with it all :)  Service was pretty good. We received proper greetings upon entrance and exit, and we never had to wait too long for anything. A manager even came by to see how things were going, and we were given a survey to fill out at the end of our meal. So clearly they are aiming to please their customers, which is good.  Overall, food was just ok and service above average. Three stars for you, Guy Fieri.",

For dessert I'd recommend the Monte Cristo. Funnel cake \"bread\" filled with whipped cream, chocolate and marshmallow fluff. Topped off with powdered sugar and a side of raspberry sauce for dipping. It makes an already great meal even better.",

Everything is expensive and Vegasy so you have to rate them based on other Vegasy places.  So I must give Guy Fieri an average rating.  The food was good but not great and if I am paying Vegas prices I want high Vegas quality food.    The restaurant is pretty small so if you don't have a reservation you will probably have to wait during peak times.  We arrived and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we put our name down and then stacked out a place at the bar and were able to claim bar seating in about 5 minutes.  The service from behind the bar was very good, fast but not bothersome.  The specialty drinks ok but small for the price.    I had the turkey burger and it was better than most I have had at restaurants but still not as good as the one my husband makes at home.  I did find it funny that they put bacon on a turkey burger but hey that was fine with me.  I liked that the pretzel bun was good and soft like I prefer.  I also liked the fries that came with the burger.  They give you all sorts of different ones all together and they were all good.",

I cannot for the life of me remember the one female bartender we had but she was amazing! I started out with a PBR (yes i know, but its one of my guilty pleasures) and that was followed by numerous Jameson shots.   App and salad wise we started with the Vegas Fries. Thick wedges tossed in spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese crumbles and served with blue-sabi sauce. AHHHH Ive literally had dreams about these. The salad we had was the Deli Salad. Prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone filled with crisp romaine lettuce, imported Italian meats & cheeses, pickled Italian veggies then tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. So bomb!  The Entrees we tried were the Double Barrel BBQ Wings, they were tossed in a bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce and i had the side of wasabi blue cheese. NOM. We also shared the Mayor of Flavortown Burger. Seasoned pastrami, Swiss cheese, caraway seed slaw, dill pickles, onion straws, dijon mustard and a pretzel bun. Words cant describe how freaking delish this all was.   The manager Alex was so nice and gave us some amazing recommendations. We will def be back sooner then later for another amazing experience!!",

We finally made it to the parking garage, which by the way you access through the Harrah's parking. Once you get in there follow the signs to the Ling casino parking lot.  It's not often l will pay $21.00 for a burger, but l splurged and got his famous bacon macaroni and cheese burger. I asked for no bun....cut down on some carbs , and it comes with fries, spicy waffle and regular shoestring fries. Hubby got a bacon cheeseburger. We were both very happy with our meal. Yummy is an understatement. As for drinks, l got the Austin Iced tea with sweet tea vodka and l believe peach schnapps. Who cares it was delish, but pretty strong.  Hubby got Guy's winery red blend. Says it was good but hes really a Shiraz man.  We had no room for dessert l needed someone else to share the Cheesecake challenge and from what l saw the dessert selection was awesome. Fun to go to a place owned by Guy Fieri and critique his food. What would have made it better would have been seeing him in the kitchen. An awesome ending to an amazing weekend.",

These chips were stale.... the toppings were good enough, the chipotle bbq sauce was my favorite out of the toppings. It had potential but it didn't happen tonight (so disappointing, it looked like the thing to get because while we were waiting for our seat we kept watching them come out of the kitchen) Next we got the bacon mac and cheese burger $21.50 the beef was tasty & it was a good combo of toppings but it wasn't a Wow! The fries were nothing special.  It was a trio of fries, regular, 2 wedge fries & crisscross fries.  Overall the experience was average. I was expecting more quality.  Would I come back again? With all the other options vegas has to offer.... Nah.",

It's Vegas, the night was young. I decided to try the turkey burger. It had a spicy kick to it and was delicious. It came with fry trio which is basically 3 different types of fries. Wish it had a pickle with it as I saw the other burgers have them!  Nice server, well organized drink runners. Overall great time!",

I was fully expecting at least a 30 minute wait for a table, based on the reviews but lucked out when we only had to wait 5 minutes to accommodate our group of 6 on a Wednesday evening.  We wanted to watch the hockey game on tv and were able to catch up with old friends, eat dinner all at the same time  -- win-win in my book!   Speedy service, friendly wait staff, accommodating to large groups.   We ordered the trash can nachos to start.  Neat concept to pile the ingredients into a can and remove it at the table by lifting the can up and letting the ingredients fall onto the plate.   Good but nachos were a tad too spicy for my liking.     For dinner, I ordered the original ringer burger and came with fries.  The burger was flavorful but very, very messy.   I asked the waiter if I could sub fries for a side salad and was told that I could.  When I got my check, there was a $3 dollar up charge for subbing the salad.  It didn't break the bank, but would've been nice to know on the front end.     Hands down - one of the best Bloody Mary's on the strip!",

I treated my self to the Jack Daniel NY Strip Steak cooked medium serves with smashed smoked potatoes with bacon, caramelized onions, sour cream, scallions, shredded cheese, with asparagus and a Demi glaze sauce for about $32. I also got a side salad with my meal and washed it all down with a cold Shock Top!   It wasn't the best steak I've ever had but it definitely had some good flavor. The loaded potatoes definitely complimented the steak very well. I will be back to try more of the signature items and I'm looking forward to it.   Guy is a legend so this is a must try off the name alone. Try it out!! You won't retreat it.",

    "text": "The restaurant sat right on the strip at the Linq hotel and it's quite difficult to miss considering the name. We came for brunch. We decided to order the breakfast burger and the Fieri Family French Toast.  The breakfast burger was so-so. I've had better elsewhere, but its size and presentation made it seem extravagant. I did enjoy the assortment of waffle fries and regular fries that came on the side.  Fieri Family French Toast is a decent breakfast choice here. I felt the bacon didn't work too well with the French toast. Some establishments have excellent bacon and sweet pairings. They would candy the bacon and slice them into smaller bits. Then, the bacon would work harmoniously with other sweets as it introduces a unique subdued flavor. The French Toast here placed regular slices of large savory bacon on my toast and the flavors didn't work so well together. Of course the banana itself worked with the toast.  I thought service was a tad slow for us, but that was ok for the most part and didn't undermine the experience.",

I mean veggies make it to BBQ spots. The mac and cheese, KRAFT. So gross. The only thing I can say that was semi- good were the nachos. Down to the presentation, those were the only ok thing. The theme of the place is Go Big or Go Home...I should've stayed at home. There are so many better places to eat, I wouldn't waste my time or money...go somewhere else if you're looking for delicious food. And if you want just OK food, order room service, as I'm sure it's better than anything at Guy's.",

We went on a Friday night so we knew that being a restaurant on the strip, the wait would be long but the hour long wait should have been the first red flag. In any case, we stuck it out since we really wanted to try out the drinks (which I ended up not getting because they were taking too long so I drank the red bull and vodka my friend brought with her on the walk to and from the TI, her hotel). After ordering drinks, our party waited at least 30 minutes for drinks. This includes non alcoholic drinks. For real?!?  Disappointment after disappointment. Menu was subpar. As my husband states, \"for a guy that travels around the country trying different food, the menu sure lacks variety and creativity.\"  Then, the food we ordered took another 45 minutes to arrive. Finally, when asking for water from the same server, 3 times, and not getting it, my friend got up and got it herself. When a waitress came over to the station where the water was held, instead of telling my friend that she would take us water, as she should have done, she directed my friend to the water with ice and told her to go ahead and take it to our table. How unprofessional!!!!  If she saw a colleague of hers wasn't working to her potential when it comes to customer service, she should have done it herself to help the restaurant redeem itself.   When out friend spoke to the manager, his excuse was that that they were short staffed. Again, a Friday night on the strip, you should have more than enough staff, knowing how busy it can get. We were given a discount on the check, although it does not make up for the Slow service and lack of professionalism. Will not be visiting again.",

I was done eating by the time they came. I'm a server, so I get it about seating, & service...so we were disappointed that a food network star who's in the business didn't have a well trained staff.

Problem seems to be difficulty the wait staff has getting food out of the kitchen and drinks out of the bar. Wait staff would disappear but always seemed to come flying back out of the little bar nook where they were held up waiting for customer's drinks. Guys next to us waited 15 minutes for a beer. One beer. That's a flow problem for MANAGEMENT to fix. And it NEEDS to be fixed.  Loved the buffalo tossed fries. Interesting shapes and not too much sauce. Burger would have been good but was overcooked. They don't ask how you want it, which should have been the first clue. They're all well done.  I'd try it again.

The Pasta dish was also really good not too spicy with perfect amount of sauce and really delicious side of garlic bread. Now the service was not on point. Our waiter only came 1 time to check on us. Most of the staff was just chit chatting with themselves. Service  does not match how great the food was. (I had to come back and edit review to add more to it).",

For mains we tried the burger which was ok, but not special, and the lobster tacos. The tacos themselves and the filling were tasty, but the lobster was old and chewy. Having said all of that, I would have given 3 stars if it wasn't for the fact that the service was awful. Our server was so rude, and not just to us, but to all the tables she served. It was shocking really. Why management don't deal with it is beyond comprehension. Won't go back there.",

Me and my bf took leftovers back to the hotel, but my bf never even finished it. $30 for some chicken parm that tasted like pepperoni pizza. Too much tomato sauce! Wish we didn't spend so much here. We wanted the jalapeno popper appetizer, but they were out. The mac and cheese in the burger was dry, had no flavor, and did not make a difference to being added to the burger.",

Perfectly seasoned, crispy and airy not greasy like you would imagine. The fries are a mix of waffle, crinkle, potatoes chip- worth the $5 for the side.",

(Costs $21.50 btw). Man it was a let down. Very average burger with the smallest spoon of Mac and Cheese on it. Was pretty weak. Normally when I get a Mac and cheese burger somewhere, it's got an entire side of Mac and Cheese on it. Not a heaping tablespoon in it. I didn't know it was there without opening the burger up.   So yea meh. Tasted OK. But yea I wouldn't pay $21.50 for that again.   Service was killer though. Waitress was attentive and when a heat lamp exploded over one of our plates, they came over, let us know, and gave us pitchers of beer to make up for it. The food was brought out after being remade.   We were well taken care of. Just bleh $21.50 for that burger was a disappointment.",

The vibe is very rock  with jean costumes for the servers, brick walls, skull accents and badassness all around. We ordered the Trashcan Nachos which were delicious!!!!! And the famous Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger which was also very good! The only downside was when we got the Lobster Tacos...I was excited to try them but to my disappointment they were BLAH! The tortillas were cold, lobster and fixings bland, and the side of rice was a weird fried rice fusion of BS if you ask me. The meals are pricy for what you get; $20+ dishes, and when its all said and done for an appetizer, two entrees, and two beers come out to $90+. I took a star off for the over pricing and another for the quality of the food; this place should be way cheaper, you are buying a Guy Fieri thrill not a decent meal.",

And finally when our bill came.   Food was sub par.   Burgers and fries were cold.  Salad was good but everything else was over salted and not what was to be expected.   We did order the fondue and asked for bread or something to dip in the fondue.  We were told they had no bread and to wait for the fries.  When the fries did arrive the fondue was cold and solid.  When asked if they could rewarm the fondue we were told there was no way too by a server and she walked away..  No way jose never gonna recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "The food is ok - NOT amazing like you will remember it when your credit card bill for $95 dollars(with tip, $80 without) comes in a month .   We ordered the mac and cheese burger, the pork sandwich and 3 cocktails.  Big high calorie and fat portions (appropriate for sharing due to massive calories surely contained in each portion but we ordered separately not knowing). Now, the fries were the best I ever had.    Drinks were weak and expensive.  $12-15!  That should be a strong amazing drink for that price.  The lemon drop one came in a half empty glass that looked like the waiter had spilled half of it.  The other one was jammed full of ice and was weak as could be.  If this was it I'd give 3 stars.  The worst part was the HORRIBLE service.  Our server talked as fast as an auctioneer I had to ask him to repeat!  He brought the food then we ate it. My friend was almost finished but not quite, I was about 2/3 done. He appears, says to us \"are you done\" while reaching his hand for her plate.  Flustered she just said yes. I had to say no.    Now I'm eating alone and being hurried along feeling bad about eating like I'm not in a eating competition. I finish my meal. THE MINUTE I FINISH, he comes by, grabs the plate, asks if we want dessert and if we WANT THE CHECK!    The attitude was like being at a low end Dennys with a waiter chasing table turnover for their instant tip.  The service did not deserve a penny of tip.  Of course we had to leave our 18% because that's how it is these days.  I could say he was just a one off but the other servers were whizzing past our table with trays held up and more than once came within an inch of banging right into my friends HEAD.  None of them apologized or even stopped.    Maybe its different if it's not a Thursday dinner at 6pm.  Maybe.",

We ordered two award winning,  $17 Mac and cheese burgers with fries and a $30 ish long island bowl. Our server didnt ask how we wanted our patty cooked, but didnt pay it any mind (now I know why). The server also made a great suggestion instead of ordering two long islands, order the bowl instead! (Kudos to him for that suggestion) We get our burgers and they are massive....however the burger patty was no thicker than my phone, maybe less. It was like In-n-out thin, but really crispy.( btw not a good thing, I hate in-n-out). Tomatoes were soggy, bun was good, bacon was nothing to remember, and the mac tasted like effortless  kraft mac and cheese. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars because the fries were oddly amazing, the long island had a good punch and friendly service. It wasnt a good way to start our trip. Expensive nasty burgers. Please don't waste your carbs or money here! I'd rather have an in-n-out burger over this burger!!",

Some staff member (not our original waitress) came by and told us that we had been there long enough and other people were waiting to be seated. We got up and left and as we were walking out, I was complaining to my husband that it was rude how they approached things. Little did I know that the staff member who to told us to leave overheard and he started giving us attitude and kept saying \"three hours, three hours\" - as if we sat there and spent zero dollars the whole time.  Anyhow, the whole experience left a bad impression. If you really care about your customers, you won't make them feel like they're taking up space like these people did. Additionally, as we walked out, we noticed that there weren't people waiting to be seated. They just wanted us to leave.   I guess that's what you get from Triple Douche.",

It was swamped so had to sit at the bar (otherwise there was an hour wait, but it was a Friday night).  The service at the bar was a bit slow.  Good draft beer selection.  I had an antipasto salad, very interesting presentation.  The \"bowl\" (which was on a plate) was made of Prosciutto, filled with greens, cheeses, and other meats....lots of cheeses though (that seems to be his trademark I'd guess).  My friend ordered a burger which was very large (she had to cut it in half to attempt to eat it), and we split an order of truffle fries...which were large enough that when placed between us, we couldn't see on another (not really joking here).  They were delicious, but could easily feed a party of five.  Not bad, but don't know that I'd rush back.",

The crouton was a one giant piece of cumbersome stale breadcrumb. The additional $7 for chicken was a mistake as it was charred to an almost unendurable state, leaving MAYBE half the two small skewers of chicken edible. The only reason we didn't send it back was because we had to send MY food back.  I ordered the \"famous\" Mac N Cheese burger with no tomato. Guess what? Showed up with tomato. It also showed up with congealed macaroni and cheese as it had been under the heat lamp too long. And I know this happens because when we were waiting for our table I was watching food placed under said lamps in a very open and public kitchen area that sat there for eons.  We had our children with us and guess what? First place we have ever been which did not have a kids menu. That's just par for the course anywhere that is not a high end steak house.   Our server was a middle aged gentlemen with a pony tail who seemed absolutely disinterested in our interests and experience. He didn't smile, seemed like it was as painful for him to work there as it was for us to eat there.  This place wasn't even busy when we were there, tons of open tables and it was just the absolute worst dining experience we have ever had in Las Vegas.  This place is an utter tourist trap and I fell for it which is sad because I consider myself quite savvy with food and dining. HIGHLY overpriced and MASSIVELY under delivers.  Atrocity is how I can summarize this restaurant in a single word.",

I ordered a Bloody Mary which you can pick different toppings for. My drink came out with none of the toppings I requested but instead had cucumber, jalapenos, peppers and pepperoni. When I told the server it wasn't what I ordered, she simply said, \"Oh, we are out of everything else.\" Why wouldn't she have told me that when I ordered it or at least come to tell me before making it??   Then our food came out. My husband ordered the Mac and cheese burger and I ordered the original one that is very plain. Our burgers were only $2 different on price, but his had a ton of stuff on it?! Both of them were cooked very well done and were like dry hockey pucks.   The service was mediocre at best. The server rarely came around to refill water and we were sitting outside in 96* heat.   I have to say it was disappointing. If they can't keep up with their sections, they shouldn't give the servers so many tables so they are able to pay more attention and give better service to the ones they have.  Side note: It is extremely loud. It's possibly so loud that the servers couldn't hear what was being ordered and that's why there were so many other mistakes (I didn't mention all of them). If you want to have a conversation with your dining partners, don't come here or come when it's not busy!!  A dining experience not worth $70 for two people!!",

    "text": "Let me say this, I came in twice to this restaurant because I freakin' love burgers. Both times I was seated at the full service bar.  The first night Christina helped me. She was very friendly and outgoing. If I needed anything she was right there. I ordered the Triple B Burger. It was phenomenal. One of the best burgers I've had. It came with a small sampling of four different fries. The fries weren't bad but nothing to write home about. At the end of my meal I was asked to fill out a short survey which I was sure would be thrown out because I answered so positively about her. The food service was quick and I enjoyed my visit. Enough to come back the very next day even.  Now the next visit I came in around the same time and was again seated at the full service bar. This time however the service was less than par. I sat on my stool for a solid five minutes before being handed a menu. One bartender spent this entire time talking to his friend that were sitting next to me. I knew they were friends because he knew their names and talked about what they posted on Facebook. The bartender that finally helped me though barely looked at me other than to take my menu.  I ordered the Mac n Cheese Bacon Burger which came out fairly quickly. Again the burger was incredible, just as I expected. I have nothing bad to say about the food. However, while eating I finished my drink and despite sitting right at the bar it took nearly ten minutes to be refilled. I finished my meal and had to wait between five and ten minutes before I could ask for the check. This time I wasn't asked to fill out a survey (probably because even they knew the service was poor.)  I'll consider coming back, but will be on the look out for Christina or I'll wait for a table.",

Such a disappointment. My french dip was very large and looked good but the cut of meat was very poor and chewy.  Not like a prime rib dip.  Another disappointment. I had such high expectations but now I realize he has never visited his restaurant but always somebody other than his.

The nachos were ok, but it was like canned cheese. the fireball wings were gross. They were dry, and the taste of the cinnamon easy gross. Like if they bought them frozen and just fried them. The burger was a burger, but honestly who smashed the pattie flat? Just dries put the burger over all. The servers just stand there doing nothing although there were like 2 doing their job.

The $50 worth of drinks were two Bloody Mary's - which our waiter refused to customize even though the menu boasts customization- and two Mimosas.

The brunch menu consists of six things all with tons of meat, bacon, eggs or so much sugar (pancakes with syrup, sugar, fruit in sugar and whipped cream) that you can go into a diabetic coma just from reading. Hey, I love indulgence and fun food but does it have to be limited to bacon, sugar, fat and grease? Disappointing menu and bad service ,,, left without eating or even enjoying a good cocktail. $$$",

This restaurant represents his inner spirit I believe- a biker would love this place.  I had just eaten at Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill in Cesars Palace the night before and if I had the option between the two- thats where I would be going back!  Here I had the \"Shareables\"- Sashimi Won-Tacos (sashimi-grade ahi tuna packed into crispy wonton shells with mango jicama salsa, sweet soy, scallions, wasabi cream) and Vegas Fries which I was so excited to try as they were featured on his show and it was his first popular recipe so it must be good right?... (crispy sidewinder fries tossed in spicy buffalo seasoning and topped with blue cheese crumbles served wit house made buffalo sauce and blue sari dipping sauce (which is a mixture of blue cheese and wasabi)).  The Sushi Tacos, although an interesting concept, and seems as though they would have lots of flavor- had none! You would think they would be spicy with the wasabi but absolutely not. The salsa didn't even have any flavour.  The fries were the opposite end of the spectrum they were TOO spicy and you couldn't even taste the blue cheese..",

Put our name in and they said they would find us. After quite awhile, no one came out. We went back in and they said we were next and to wait next to the podium. Then they didn't call us so we went up to them 20 min later and they said \"oh\" you are next.   We sat down and waited. It took 20 min for our server to come over. It didn't look as he was terribly busy as he had quite a few tables around him. We were sat on the patio. Although it was cold out, they have heaters outside which was nice but they sat us at the one that was off or broke. Needless to say, it was cold.   On food, we ordered Chili, turkey burger and a a suggested sandwich (I can't recall the name but Monte something). I ordered a salad to start. He asked if i wanted it first and i said yes. About 20-30 min later my salad came out and 1 min later the food came out. The food took forever. The food runner was good and very professional when it came out, however it took forever and no apologies. The sever came back about 20 min later. My Monte sandwich (on a pretzel bun with some chunks of pork and cheese and slaw on it) was rock hard and cold on the inside. The fries were cold as well. We was starving and tried to eat it but only ate half and it was very poor all around. My wife had the turkey and she said it was like sliced deli Turkey and had an odd taste. She was not impressed. My friends chili was good with no complaints. The server this time didn't come back this time for 30+ min. We wanted dessert. He ordered it. It took 10 min and it looked as it had canned crushed pineapple on it. It wasn't very appealing and the taste wasn't worth the $15. The total experience, when we sat down, took 2 hours. TWO HOURS in the cold with crappy food. Not typical, I'm sure, but very poor. We travel 300 days a year and this was one of the worst experiences for a reputable place I've been to in a long while. We won't be back with all the opportunities here in Vegas.",

    "text": "I visit Vegas once a month and I had yet to eat here. I always walked past it and told myself that I needed to get in there and check out what all the fuss was about. I was super excited to get in there and I had high hopes. Although I would have loved to try a burger , I gave up bread for Lent so I went with the chicken wings. In my honest opinion, they were a complete fail. The wings look absolutely delicious when they were served to me , I also ordered a side of fries which I also was not impressed with.  \"Fireball Whisky Wings These wings are certainly not for the faint of heart & should probably be illegal. classic buffalo sauce + fireball whisky meet to ignite a flavor explosion of epic\"  This was the description of the Wings I ordered and it's not what I received at all. The wings were cold and they were very sweet in flavor. Not my jam at all. The side of fries I ordered were drenched in some type of Cajun flavored seasoning which I also didn't enjoy. The only reason I'm giving this place to stars is because the waitress was very friendly.  Would I visit this place again??? not by choice.  .",

    "text": "On our first visit here, the week it opened, the hostess have us a quick mini tour as she was taking us to our table. On our next visit, we didn't get that.  The first time, we sat outside, which was actually pretty nice. It's rather loud, but the people watching is awesome and you can hear / somewhat see the bands playing at Carnival Court. On our second visit, we sat inside at a high top. Avoid this at all costs. The high-tops are way way WAY too close together and super awkward. Our sever even apologized for how awkward it was.   The ambiance and space are cool. Has a definite Guy feel to it. It reminds me of a nicer and newer Tex Wasabi's (Sonoma Valley location).   I was super SUPER excited to come here because of one thing: Vegas fries! As you might notice on my profile here on Yelp, Vegas fries would be my last meal. The Vegas fries at Tex Wasabi's are just a total dream. But alas, they are all different here. At Wasabi's, they are thin fries, covered and drenched in hot sauce and Parmesan crumbs. Drenched, but still crispy. Here, they're giant twisty fries. And you get a shot of hot sauce to pour over them. Hint: Right away when you order them, order extra hot sauce and extra blue wasabi sauce. The blue wasabi dipping sauce is insanely delicious. I could eat it by itself with a spoon. Seriously. God bless Guy Fieri for coming up with this. So while the Vegas fries aren't the same, they're still tasty. And the portion is huge. 4 stars.  So on to the wings. Have I mentioned how much I love hot wings? The Fireball whiskey wings have a fantastic flavor and are served with the divine blue wasabi sauce. 4 stars. The Parmaggedon wings are mostly breading and were too dry and overdone. They're served with a marinara dipping sauce which was tasty. 2 stars. The wings themselves are kinda fatty and don't seem like the best quality. If they were better quality, they'd be more stars.  Be wary of the beer flight deal. We were told it was $11. But that's actually $11 per each series of 4 beers. We were quite shocked when we received our bill. But after asking the waitress, she knocked the price back to what we thought it was. The full tasting is 4 series of 4 beers. And if you drink them all, you get a t-shirt. James O. and I were sharing, so our server was really nice and let us each have a t-shirt. Very cool. Fair warning: The beers are mostly IPAs, and you should share as, well, that's a lot of f-ing beer.  The frozen shots sounded intriguing to me, so I ordered the Fireball whiskey one. It was not frozen. It was totally room temp in a cold shot glass. Not at all what I was imagining.  The fried sundae was so fabulous. Huge! Get it! It comes with a ton of toppings and you basically create your own fried ice cream sundae. We had a blast with this. 5 stars.  On both visits, the servers were nice, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive.   All in all, I'll keep coming back. But I wonder if I can get the Vegas fries Tex Wasabi-style? They are quite better that way.",

    "text": "Guy's is located to the newly renovated Quad hotel near the pathway leading to Harrah's. They have an option for indoor seating which features awesome brown cow print bar stools or covered outdoor seating allowing for people watching and music courtesy of Carnival's DJ.   We chose the later, it was a relatively cooler day (in Vegas terms) so outdoor seating was obvious. I chose the Greek salad with the barbecue chicken wings as an appetizer. Our waiter was nice enough and took our orders quickly and got us our drinks. Side note, our waters had some of the largest ice cubes (actual cubes) that I had ever seen in my life - I was amazed. I was also pleasantly surprised by the speediness in which our food came out.   The chicken drumsticks were ingenious, each drumstick was trimmed down leaving the meat at the bottom of the bone almost creating a handle making it super easy to bite down without the mess. The plate was accompanied by a delicious sauce that I can only guess was a creamy ranch and a bowlful of fresh veggies.   My Greek salad was a complete work of art in multiple layers, so pretty but in the end a little hard to eat. The base layer of my salad featured hummus and then built upon that were romain lettuce spears, garbanzo beans, red and yellow tomato chunks, cucumbers, feta cheese triangles, croutons and topped off with shredded parmesan. The salad was drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette which I was most excited about however it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. As mentioned before it was difficult to cut into the spears without contents of my salad spilling onto the table so in the end I just picked up the spears with my hands and ate it that way, not a big deal but messy nonetheless.   During my meal I noticed how attentive the wait staff was, constantly checking on our party and others in our area. At one point a manager even came over to introduce herself to us. I realized why at the end when we were paying, inside of their bill placards they have an iTouch installed so patrons can take surveys about their experience at the restaurant.   Note: Total Rewards members get a discount on various items on the menu, if you don't have one - they're free so go get one.",

Live TV, loud music, and a great space!  Upon walking in, the greeting and the hostesses, I felt, were awkward.. We were seated and our server was Olga. She was pleasant and attentive!  Now about the food.. Portions are big, quality is good, but the items don't scream \"to die for\".. We had : * Java Guava - guava juice cocktail with a touch of alcohol * Parmaggedon Wings - brined and roasted Parmesan wings served with marinara sauce -- very tender, moist, flavorful wings! * Triple T Fries - truffle fries sprinkled with truffle served with truffle sauce -- def not as truffley as it sounds.. * Drunken Fish Tacos - tilapia, avocado and fresh veggies -- nothing too impressive.. * Mac N Cheese Burger - bacon, mac n cheese served on a brioche bun -- DELICIOUS! * Mexican Churros - fried churros with two dips : spicy chocolate & dulce de leche (my fave of the two!)   Two other things -- they have big chunks of squared ice in the drinks which lasted forever, kept my water nice and cold! AND the side of ranch we had was AMAZING! Just the little, simple things that topped off the experience!  Overall pleased with the service and food! Wouldn't mind coming back to try the other menu items!",

After not finding the nachos that inspired my previous review the waitress informed us the menu had changed and yesterday was the last day they served those . Really ?  They took too long to make and slowed up the kitchen . Really ?  First don't tell someone clearly disappointment about a menu item they're a day late and charge me more if u can't make a profit .  Also missing was taco sampler.  When food arrived my husband tacos looked like steak not chicken, we told waitress and she gave some speech about changing the marinade.  After another bite and further inspection they were clearly steak.  She did not return to table until I have finished my meal to check back. She was over seated and obviously stressed out.  She took the food , never offered to replace with correct food or anything. Came back awhile later to bring check and sad she removed form ticket.  We never asked her to, just wanted what we ordered.  We left hungry, bummed, and won't be visiting again. Too bad, they really were great nachos",

We were seated right away .After we got there then people coming in we're waiting. the service was great everyone was very friendly and accommodating.I had the original burger it was very good and decent portions fries were sooo good just enough seasoning.My mom had the the Turkey picnic sandwich she loved it, also a huge portion also with the fries.She is still talking about it. I loved the ambiance  from the high booths to the bar chairs .The menus and the napkins I would have loved to take home. The only complaint I do have is I was going to by a tee shirt and it was $35 I left it there . Granted  you are in Vegas but when a shirt costs more than your meal that's nuts. I look forward to going back next year.",

I always love accurate wait estimates. We ordered the pepperoni fondue sticks to start and they were absolutely delicious. For the main dishes, my husband ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the steak tacos. I loved my dish and the side of fries that came with my husband's sandwich. I questioned all the reviews raving about the fries but now I totally get it. The fries are totally delicious and there were four different kinds. Best fries I've ever had! The only negative was service. It took us a while to get waters and drinks--they only came after our appetizer arrived--and our server didn't check in on us very frequently and gave us some attitude when we asked for drink refills.",

Seated around 5:45 and weren't asked for a drink order until after 6 pm.  Yes, we waited over 15 minutes to place an order.  If it weren't for the drink runner guy noticing us we would have never even gotten a drink.  Once the waiter finally came to take our order we ordered our 2 iced teas and our burgers.  My husband got the tiple B and I ordered the original ringer.  We got our burgers approximately 25 minutes later and they as well as the fries were dry and boring.  The burgers were nothing special for almost $20 a piece.  At $50 total for the both of us to eat here, I wish I had taken my $50 elsewhere.  We are locals and don't spend much time eating on the strip but we were on our way to see Mystere at TI so we figured why not.    Sorry Mr. Fieri, but I feel like your place is an embarrassment to you.  I expected much better.  Save your money people.  This place is not triple D worthy.",

The food itself was just blah to me. I feel I was duped on opening night with flavorful food to make the tv personality look like a hero of sort.  The off Da Hook burger. Loaded with lettuce and a giant onion ring pickles and a burger patty that was hard to locate. It brought back memories of a commercial saying \" where's the beef??\" Gen Tso's wings- the presentation was on point but the wings were not. Soaking in the sauce they lacked any kind of crispness.  Rojo Rings- oversized onion rings with some good flavors. This was the only part of the meal that didn't disappoint.  Too many other options to in LV to give this place another shot. I hate to spend money on disappointing food.",

The server was very knowledgeable of the menu and when we asked what he would recommend he immediately pointed out a few selections. He then explained that the staff trained for a month and got to try all items on the menu, which for most places, rarely happens, so this was nice to hear that he really knew what he was talking about.   My group tried each thing he recommended and all of the food was amazing and so fresh. I love that the burgers come on pretzels buns and that the fries come in all shapes and sizes. Not to mention everything is seasoned very well. The burgers were so juicy and the pulled pork sandwich was so good. You could really taste the smoke on the pork.  I was really disappointed in their alcohol selection. They don't have a big menu for their specialty drinks (I think maybe less than 10 listed), they don't have a blender and they were out of midori. So that was a bummer.   I will definitely go back and recommend to everyone though. The food and servicer were excellent!",

And they pride themselves with zero \"naked nachos\". They hit the mark.   Had the pulled pork and rock shrimp street tacos for our main meal. Great tasting. Large portions. And to top it off, the fries that cd with the pulled pork are mixed! So you get waffle fries, steak fries, and skinny fries all together! Bonus!   Customer service was great. Prices were extremely reasonable (especially for a strip restaurant).   Highly recommend making this a go-to place for any meal while you're in Vegas!",

We sat near the bar at a booth which was sitting high off the ground. I noticed that this place looks like it should be sitting in Texas somewhere due to the atmosphere and the way the help staff was dressed. Never would have pegged Guys restaurant as country.  The food was absolutely delicious! To start we ordered  the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. The cheese sauce for this was the best I had. I would have never put pepperoni around a pretzel stick but it was really good. My husband ordered the Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger, which we were told that it is the most popular burger they have. He said it was really good. I ended up ordering the Pic-A-Nik Sandwich. It was surprisingly good. The cranberry relish is a little out there but it works and they also put BBQ chips on the sandwich but nothing I can complain about.  I give this a five star because the food was outstanding and everything I expected from Guy Fieri",

I'm glad I tried it but I wasn't blown away that It wasn't that good where I would be running back next time I visited or eager to try another one of his restaurants. I guess that's the price you pay for being such a personality that the bar is set high!! Anyways worth the try.",

His recipes are excellent!   First off, there are not places to sit for people who are in a 2 plus hour wait in line. The girls at the hostess booth were more into their own conversation rather than making us feel welcomed. One we got to our table of four we immediately noticed only 2 sets of dining utensils. Okay fine, the waitress will come back and give us more later. FAIL.   We asked for water with lemon. The waitress came out with 4 dirty ass glasses and the water tastes like chlorine. Then she forgot our lemons. She looked so irritated when we kindly asked her for lemons which she grabbed from the bar and put out in a glass cup. They were soggy as if cut from days before.   I ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger. It was delicious. But still no knife, fork or napkin. I had to get up and grab my own napkin. I caught the waitress eyes and she just ignored me. So when she finally came back, I asked her for two more damn sets of utensils. Pathetic.   We always tip but this lady was rude. If you can go anywhere else DONT GO HERE. staff is RUDE. not with the money.",

Not to sweet and some great heat from the jalapeno. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. Thats where the positives end in our visit there. I ordered the Bacon Mac n cheese burger which was evidently voted best burger in las vegas. I politely disagree. The patty was overdone and did not have much flavor. It appeared to be the frozen pre-formed variety. The rest of the toppings were just ok. For $21 it was very underwhelming. Pretty disappointed to be honest. My friend ordered the 14 hour brisket and they said it was one of the worst plates he's ever had. The brisket was extremely fatty and when he was done half the portion was left as there was nothing but fat remaining. The waitress was very kind and saw that we were disappointed so she was able to get the bill reduced. I had great expectations of this place but needless to say I will not go back.",

Never in my life imagined I could love a sandwich so much. The food is priced higher than usual, but you must take into consideration that the restaurant is the namesake of a celebrity, the restaurant is located inside the LINQ hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, and the portions are huge. In all honesty, I could barely finish half of my sandwich, let alone the whole thing. But, that isn't always a bad thing!",

We started off with Guy-talian Fondue Dippers which were pepperoni-wrapped breadstick with a provolone and sausage cheese dip. Im not a big pretzel person but these were great. The cheese dip is what makes the dish. We also got the Fireball whiskey wings which were great. they came with some kind of blue cheese dip which paired great with it.  For our mains we got the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger which won burger of the year in vegas last year. This burger is built with crispy applewood bacon, six cheese mac, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  Great burger with great flavor. They even cut this burger in fourths for us. The burger comes with 4 different types of fries and all were amazing and went great with the leftover cheese sauce from the pretzels.   We also got the 14 hour slow smoked brisket. Wow, some serious flavor here. Looks like a plate of BBQ brisket that you would get in Texas. I just thought that were was a little too much bbq sauce drizzled over the meat. I would've liked to try more of the flavor from the brisket.   Lastly, we ended with Triple Doublemint Pie. Holly cow, this was huge. It was a mint chocolate chip ice cream pie with oreo cookie crust and hot fudge. We had 4 people and couldn't even get close to finishing this dessert.   The service was excellent and they were on top of everything.",

I got a side of their famous fries to share too, and they were perfectly crispy with the right amount of seasoning. Our server Nicole was attentive and such a sweetheart. I'll definitely be back :)",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined at this restaurant the last time he was in town. It was a pretty breezy and cool day and we sat inside to keep warm. The doors from the patio entrance kept opening and closing from waitstaff so it was difficult to stay warm and even keep our napkins on our laps.   I suppose it was a busy afternoon.  We were sat, but not greeted for at least 15 minutes.  When we finally were able to order we decided on sharing the Vegas Fries and two Brutha's Badass Caesar Salad to start with. The fries were delicious I loved the buffalo seasoning and blue cheese. Some of the potatoes were over cooked though and we had to pick through a lot of inedible fries. The salads were pretty boring and weren't worth the money spent on them. I don't know what went wrong they just didn't taste good at all.   My boyfriend had a regular burger which he said he enjoyed and I ordered the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger. It was probably the most delicious turkey burger I've ever eaten.    I'd probably go back just to get the turkey burger but to be honest going to the strip hotels is not very convenient even as a local, and I probably wouldn't bother making a trip just for a burger.",

    "text": "This was a huge disappointment. The Greek salad was tasteless. Huge whole romaine leaves, quartered tomatoes, whole radishes, a few olives, water thin cucumbers and red onions, and a couple of feta chunks with hummus underneath the whole mess. The chicken breast was hardly seasoned and far from grilled, let alone blackened as advertised. We opted for takeout which was half the size of the platters, but at the same price. The Cajun pasta was mildly spiced, but ingredients were unoriginal. The takeout packages were considerably smaller than the portions served in house. They are ill equipped for takeout. The containers were filled like leftovers, sloppy and unappetizing.  Save your money. It's a dud.  ***One day later and we have both been sick with stomach issues since eating these meals. It's possible that an ingredient was tainted.",

They were good but just needed a little bit more flavor. I thought if they added 1 more taco then it would be worth spending $14 for it. The sashimi was fresh and the shells are a soft crisp. They broke apart pretty easily. Also tried the chicken wraps. Its only enough for 3 people. They give you only 3 pieces of lettuce and assorted chicken. Its ground chicken, skewered chicken and chicken egg rolls. My friends had a regular burger and and a turkey burger. Both dishes came with 3 or 4 assorted fries. It had good sized portions.  For a drink, I got the Java Guava. Really good. It had a little spice to it. It came with a jalapeno on the side. Dessert, we ordered a simple mint chocolate chip ice cream with oreos. Nothing too special. It was just drizzled in fudge and oreos. Also a good portion. Its enough for 3-4 people.  Overall, its an ok place. The location of the restaurant is facing the street. It also has outdoor seating. So people watching can be interesting.",

We walked around the casino to kill time went back to the restaurant checked in she told me another 20 min when 20 min had already passed, I then checked in 20 min later she pointed at her screen and stated \"this is how many are ahead of you\" wow!! So rude to say to a customer then I asked what does that mean she replied 10min. We decided to go try and sit at the bar waiting for someone to get up from their seat, another couple offered us there seats and then the bartender tells us that she assigns the seats. Wow!!! The point of a bar is that when people get up you take there spot I've never heard of bar seating assigned yet the rule didn't apply to any other customers there it seemed because people were getting up and taking seats without getting hassled. I love the food here it's really good but the customer service was poor.",

    "text": "By far the worst service we experienced in Las Vegas.   The wait for a table was supposed to be about 90 minutes, but we ended up lucking out and getting seated a lot faster...everything was looking promising. We were getting a late lunch and had early dinner plans, so we decided to split an entree and a salad. Unfortunately (for him) I'm a vegetarian and neither one of us wanted a veggie burger (one of the only vegetarian items on the menu...which wasn't TOO big of a surprise). So instead we got a salad and dessert. We also ordered 2 sodas. About half an hour goes by and we haven't seen our server at all. Eventually we tracked him down and he basically admitted that he never placed our food order...no actual apology though. Awhile later, he came by and confirmed that he submitted the order and blamed it on a receipt issue with another customer. By that point, we were both starving, absolutely freezing, and miserable. About an hour after we placed our order, the salad (a large but simple 4 ingredient caesar salad) and a massive (and admittedly delicious) dessert were served to us at the same time. Really? I get that this wasn't the most conventional \"meal\" choice, but have some common sense to at least ask if we want them together or separate.   We inhaled the food and just wanted to get out of there. Despite the massive inconvenience, we never really got an apology and our $50 bill was hardly justifiable. I get that everything is marked up in Vegas, but $50 for a 4-ingredient salad, essentially a large ice cream sundae and 2 sodas? I'd recommend going pretty much anywhere but here. There's so many celebrity chefs in Vegas, that you can pick basically any other place and be guaranteed better food and service for the value.",

The restaurant decor is great and I love the employees uniforms, they are super cute! We ordered the macaroni and cheese burger and the carne asada tacos! They were both great! The bread was soft, the meat very juicy and the overall flavor was exquisite. The only bad part was the taster flights.. For $35 you get 4oz tasting of 16 beers. The bad part is that the \"tasting\" included ordinary beers such as blue moon, PBR, miller light, sierra Nevada well you get the idea.  Who has not sampled those cheap beers before! I felt like it was a joke! The good part is that you get a T-shirt! I would totally recommend this place!",

    "text": "My friend is Guy Fieri's big fan and watches his shows regularly, so when we were walking along the Strip and were hungry, we thought it would be great to have lunch there. It was very noisy inside. The service was very slow. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated, then it took another 20 minutes for our order to be taken. I had Pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was very good, it was one of the best pulled pork I've had in a while. The sauce was a little spicy, but not bad for me, even better. The prices are a little high though. Overall,just a typical burger place. Nothing special.",

    "text": "Went here last week for lunch. When we were seated it took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over and even get our drink order. Once they did we ordered our food, which consisted of the pepperoni pretzel fondue things and 2 of the Mac and cheese burgers. It took 45 minutes for our appetizer to come out, which I believe they forgot about since the cheese fondue was super cold. Our waitress wasn't the most pleasant either. She barely said a word and seemed really irritated. I didn't get her name but we had blue hair and glasses. She must have walked by our table 5 times and noticed our appetizer plate was empty but still didn't take it so by the time the burgers came there was hardly any room. I had really high hopes for the burger, since on the menu it said it was award winning. It wasn't good at all. For starters, I don't like how they don't offer how you'd like it cooked. The Mac and cheese on the burger was flavorless and the burger itself was just mediocre. The selection of French fries had a weird sweet cinnamon taste. I'm not sure about them. I won't be coming back, mainly for the service alone. If you're looking for an amazing burger go eat at BurGR inside planet hollywood.",

First of all our waitress took about 15 minutes to come and welcome the table of 5 of us. Once finally taking our drink order and after another 10 minutes our drinks came out and she took them off the tray and sat them at one end of the table expecting us to pass out our drinks. Once the appetizers arrives they were cold, two different types of French fries. The entrees we ordered were like warm and my turkey burger was terrible. The bun was hard as a rock and the turkey burger was burnt. Everyone at the table complained about their food and we were all disappointed. Unfortunately other diners that were exiting with us had a similar experience. The food smelled great but was sub par. Don't waste your time.",

We weren't too hungry so we thought we could order a couple of appetizers and we'd be fine. There's only three or four items on their appetizer section. I ended up ordering the Greek salad and he ordered the wings. The lollipop wings are a joke, not much meat and certainly not shareable. There aren't too many wings to begin with and they charge a lot for them. For the price, I would think you would be served a little more. Looking at other tables their burgers and fries look like larger portions. My $16 salad was mediocre. Will not return. This place is like a Hooters, catered to men as the waitresses are walking around in mini skirts and low cut tops and tv screens everywhere with sports games on. The restaurant is decorated in a saloon/sports bar type ambience, loved the skull napkins.",

I ordered the original smash burger. The menu didn't list that it came with cheese or mayo, but it had both (I'm not a fan of either). It did list BBQ sauce, which wasn't on the burger. The burger itself was ok. I know it's called a smash burger but I guess I didn't realize it would be quite so smashed. They smashed all of the juice right out of it. It was fairly dry. It would have been great for a $12 burger, but for $18 I'd much rather go to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr.",

Now time for the good which didn't come until 12:18 we waited a whole hour. There were another party at the bar who were just seated already eating before we even got our food. I had the Caesar salad, I don't understand why the lettuces didn't come chopped it's whole lettuces on the plate, didn't enjoy the veggies were cut too big.

I ordered the Vegas fries and after waiting for about 25 minutes they came out ice cold, soggy and with barely a hint of blue cheese crumbles.  My son had the mac n cheese burger which was pretty good but the fries he got had so much seasoning that they looked like the seasoning bottle was dropped on them and most were inedible. The sweet iced tea tasted like the swiss sweet tea you buy by the gallon for 2.99.  My husband had the wings which were ok but nothing special i can make much better at home but the celery they brought with them looked like the pcs that you throw away before chopping, the leafy yellow soft part, when he complained the waitress said they come pre-made.  That left us perplexed.   To top off the evening the waitress spilled blue cheese dressing all over my sons pants.   If you want good food, fresh brewed iced tea and good service go to Burgr from Gordon Ramsey",

The wait time for 5 people on a saturday edc weekend wasn't that bad about 30-45mins. The host was very accommodating since i changed from 8 people to 5 people to different phone number cus i didn't have any reception so thank you for not judging me  I ordered the fondue, sashimi tacos, and truffle fries.  Our waiter was kind of out of it, i think it was just him cus after he went on break the service was a got a lot better.  The fondue dip was amazing, i'd be taking whatever my friends had and dipping it in that shit. The breadsticks didn't really taste like anything and the pepperoni wasn't too over powering which i thought was kind of nice.  I thought the sashimi tacos were hella good, that wasabi sour cream sauce whatever it was hella did it for me, now if only they were bigger.  Truffle fries, the menu says there's no such thing as too much truffle, but nawww there is. That truffle aioli was definitely doing too much and they came out kind of cold, but then again that could've just been our waiter cus it was the last thing to arrive at our table.  overall i'd definitely come back and try a burger",

I ordered a pulled pork sandy and my bf got the Mac n cheese burger. OMG everything about it was AMAZING how is that even possible it's just a sandwich? My sandy was served on a pretzel garlic bread bun and the fries were ridiculous. I would absolutely rate this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the service! The reviews we read prior could not have been more accurate! Amazing food WORST service. It's awful because I am aware of what it's like in the food industry and I try and give the benefit of the doubt always, but our waitress was extremely rude to the point of making us both uncomfortable. It was apparent she hated her job or maybe us? Who knows. Perhaps they should hire more on demeanor and experience rather than what you look like in their jean skirts.",

There were empty tables and they said there was a wait. There was NO one in front of us. All the hostess stood around acting they were there just to pose, very ride not welcoming at all. We finally get a table waitress was very rushed ask her to take our picture she said after we order food seem to be a bother to have even asked her. The food was just ok,very overpriced on what you get. We were never visited by our original waitress again. The manager came by to ask us if everything was ok we told him we needed more water he replied we have to wait for our server. What a joke. We had to stop another waiter to ask for water. Will never go back or would not recommend.",

To begin with we were told there would be a 25 minute wait when over 50% of the tables were empty. When we got to the table there was a piece of potato under my seat. When I brought it to the waitress's attention, she bent down and shoved it closer to the wall instead of having it cleaned up. I had the mac & cheese burger and I was disappointed. It had an ultra-thin meat patty with a bunch of fillers. My boyfriend had the brisket which they claim is cooked for 14 hours. The brisket was still pink and raw inside. The prices are outrageous for the crap quality they deliver. This place is all hype and does not live up to its name. You're better off hitting up the Vegas buffets.",

Seemed like it was made an hour ahead of time--just a saturated mess.  Even the lettuce was soggy. We may be back, but not sure I can convince my wife to go--it was a birthday lunch for her.  Even the meals we have had at his joint in Laughlin was better than yesterdays meal. Service saved this from being a 1-star.  Wait staff did a great job.",

They have Green Tea,  as well as several other teas, on the menu but our server told us they only have the English Breakfast Tea. As we were seated outside on a chilly Sunday morning, I was really looking forward to that green tea. I can't stand the bitter taste of English Breakfast Tea, so I got stuck with water, which I had asked with lemon and didnt receive. My husband did however get it. And when the bus boy brought out our drinks he brought a mug of hot water. No tea. WTF did you think we ordered?   Minus 1 Star. Service was Slooooooow. The server was nice but took forever for him to even get our drink orders in, and bring us our check. We sat here for nearly an hour. Good thing there's a Pokestop nearby!  Minus 1 Star. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. While tasty, the biscuit fell a apart whenever.l I tried to spear it with my fork. Overall it was a very messy dish. My husband ordered the shortbread pancake. Was dry (no syrup) and the berries it was stuffed with were sour. They definitely need to use rippebed produce.",

    "text": "My original plans were to go to a BBQ joint on the strip (because it was closer to where our plans were), but those plans got canceled and we were hungry so Guy Fieri's restaurant ended up being the move. It was a Saturday night around 8 so the crowds were starting to pick up, thankfully when we went up to the hostess stand for two there was no long wait. We chose to sit outside on their patio (which was beautiful by the way), at the end of November it wasn't freezing outside. The patio was adorned with heaters and TV's and it wasn't uncomfortable at all. Unfortunately we had to wait a little bit of time to get greeted by our server, think there may have been some confusion as to who was our server because it was a few different girls that helped us.   ANYWAYS it didn't take us long to look through the menu and decide what we wanted. My best friend ordered the Mac and Cheese burger, and I ordered the Motley Que sandwich (bbq brisket and cole slaw with French fries) with two shots of \"frozen\" crown royal and patron shots. (9 bucks a piece...not worth it If you ask me but we were paying strip prices so I digress). Everything up to that point was pretty decent until we got to the food. My sandwich was built nicely but lacked in execution, the fries (which I don't know if I still like the three types of fries in one thing) were just okay. Nothing to spectacular or flavorful. The meat was flavored okay, not really hot or sweet. What was horrible was that I would eat the sandwich and the meat would completely fall to the floor. The cole slaw was dry and not saucy. It was just an OKAY sandwich. Wouldn't come back or spend 19 bucks on it again. My friend's experience was the same. Burger was stacked so high once she took a bite everything fell out. The mac and cheese had absolutely no flavor. And even her burger was lukewarm. The ambience was nice and the service was pretty decent BUT we most likely would never come back. Theres no point. Too expensive. Not good quality,",

The food was delicious!! The portion of the nachos can feed up to three or four people. We couldn't not finish them.  Our biggest issue was the customer service.

We were able to browse through the menu while waiting and we knew what we wanted to order by the time the Hostess got us seated.   We had the following items Pineapple juice, Lemonade, Chili Bowl, and a Pulled pork sandwich.   Total with tax and tips came to $50.00  Pros: Guy Fieri's brand name. That probably justifies the $3.00-$5.00 extra per item.  Very polite, professional wait staff Chili was delicious.  Cons: Pulled pork sandwich was too sweet. (-1)  I am glad I tried this joint out.",

We also tried the Fondue dippers, and are adding it to our list!  They were AMAZING!  We've gotten smart and share a sandwich nowadays, they are HUGE!  This place has an amazing atmosphere, and you really get a lot for your money by Vegas standards!  For you Ranch aficionados, Guy's homemade is the BEST!  Try less traditional dining times for a shorter wait- we got RIGHT in at 4pm one day.",

Your actual waitress sees you maybe twice in 1 hour that you're here and the other one who clears tables asks you every 5 minutes if you are done so she can clear your plates. But when it comes to asking for the bill? Two seconds and she brought it. Didn't even ask us if we wanted anything else. If they do take out do that. Sorry Guy Fieri. We were so excited to come here and are brutally disappointed and we thought we left the best for last.",

I had the lobster tacos. The lobster had no taste. All I could taste was the spicy sauce. The tacos were actually three mini tacos. It just wasn't a lot of food for 24.50. It felt more like an appetizer. I am not a picky eater and am rarely disappointed in my food, but this left a lot to be desired. My husband had the Mac n Cheese bacon burger. The Mac and cheese was a dark yellow, you could tell it had been sitting for awhile and was cold. The burger was a mess to eat. I will say that the seasoned fries that came with the burger were delicious. We had two Miller Lites and our bill came to 63.00. I wish we would've eaten fast food and saved forty bucks.",

They have napkins that are cloth, which was not great for messy food, since every time you took a bite you had to wipe your mouth, additional napkins were needed, which we did not have.  Drinks: Good selection. The best bloody mary I had in Las Vegas (contributes to one of the 2 stars). Good spice, and flavor. Loved the raw peppers they add for garnish so you can jazz it up to your spice level.   Service: Servers were slammed, not much of a connection made with the customers. They got you what you needed when you needed it.   Food: I expected SO much more from this establishment. My fiance and friends liked their food enough (note none of them can fry an egg basically). However, I was extremely unsatisfied with the Motley Que sandwich. The sauce was in your face in a bad way. It was sickly sweet. I literally counted the 7 strands of \"coleslaw stacked\" on my sandwich. The pretzel bun gave no support to the pork and it was impossible to eat without half the meat falling out. I  ended up scrapping the pork off of the soaked pretzel bun and eating it with a fork (about 75% of my dish remained when it was removed from the table).The pickles served with all of our plates were piss warm and were absolutely disgusting. Pickles are supposed to give your mouth a cooling sensation to break up the richness of every sandwich on this menu. The french fries were crispy, well seasoned (contributes the other star given in this review).   Would never return, and would not recommend to friends heading here on vacation.",

Oh and if you decide to do the 16 4-oz beer tour, check ti make sure they have your t-shirt size in stock...if yhey don't they eill exchange the size they give you for the size you want when you come back!

They saturate the food in hot sauce to cover up lack of flavor on the blackened chicken. Forget the salad.. I now know it's possible to mess up a Cesar salad. But their water and ice tea is good.

The fries they give you with the burger are throw aways and the pepperoni pretzel sticks aren't any good, especially for the price.  I would give the place 4 to 5 stars if I hadn't met Guy Fieri last time we were there. He happened to be there, and we are huge fans. We didn't want to act star struck so we waited until the crowds had died down and he was near us. I went up to him, told him how we watch all his shows, make all his recipes, go to all the DDD restaurants. His response was, \"just snap your picture.\" I was shocked. Not even a thanks. I always thought he was such a nice down to earth guy.  We are locals and have been there a few times even though the prices are ridiculous because we wanted to support who we thought was a good guy. $15 for fries and $20 for a burger is not worth it to support someone who does not appreciate his fans. A celebrity wouldn't be one if it wasn't for their fans, and Guy Fieri lost two fans and customers that night.",

The ahi was fresh, but cold fish in cold fried wonton \"taco shells\" didn't really make it on the flavor scale. The burger also would have been much better if we had gotten it when it was still warm. Sadness with the equally confusing mix of cold-ish fries (waffle cut, ripple cut, thin cut?) I think what really made it even more lackluster \"Vegas\" fare was the waiter getting off shift after taking our order and not stopping by to tell us.

I have made several of his dishes in my own kitchen and always have gotten praise for the dish especially his \" Slamma Jamma Parmigiana \" and his \" Rice  -A- Munie\".  I have loved him ever since he first appeared on the Next Food Network Star.  I was so eager to go to his place!  Me and my Girl went on a Thursday night and guess who won?  I did because low and behold he was there with his family and his entourage!!!!  We arrive outside a quaint part of the strip what I like to call the \"strip inside the Strip\" the boardwalk underneath the high roller.  We are told we have to wait an hour but to our surprise it was only maybe a half hour.  The place was exactly what I thought it would be and that was Awesome!  Kinda reminded me of like an extension of his Big Bite Set.  Guy and his family were eating on the outside patio.  I have never seen him in person and so I get pretty nervous thinking I might just get to meet the man and eat at his restaurant the same night.  OH yeah this is a food review.  I had the Onion Ring deal, the BBQ sandwich.  They were both off the hook as explained in the menu's.  The BBQ was a hoagie roll with pulled pork and slaw topped with a very Whiskyish BBQ sauce.  Awesome non the less and the O rings with the remoulade... Well let's just use the man himself s expression.  \"MONEY!\"  My woman had the Whiskey Wings.  They were HOT but really good.  Like hot Tabasco Lollipop's... Pleased with the staff, food and atmosphere.  Oh yeah.  Did I meet Guy?  well as you would expect he was having Family time but, did manage to get up every so often to cruise his guest.  He was just very bombarded when this would happen.  I am not the type of fan who will go over to the table or swarm him for a Selfie Bomb however, He did at one time Go behind the bar to buy the whole bar shots and my Girl Vicki decided to go back there to talk to him.  she asked if he would take a PIC with us and he politely replied \"of course if you will get out from behind my Bar (smiling)\"  well, I didn't want to wait in the swarm of people to get just a photo bomb with him so I passed finished my meal and while my girl didn't like it as much as I did.  I give it a 5 Star rating.  Love it and hope to return soon or even sooner!... P.S. about a year later I was working the Sammy Hagar concert at the D Casino and running to one of the booths to fix a computer and ran (literally) into Guy himself.  He needed help with getting some club soda for his drink that was way too strong.  I let him behind the bar in one of the cooler tents... Thanked him and he went on his way Later that night I met all of his crew and then him and he is a awesome down to earth guy.  He is just trying to have fun himself.  :)    ~Vegas ROB!",

Now maybe they aren't asking for first available but we certainly did.  Service so far is so so. We've had better for much lesser restaurants, but they didn't have a trendy name behind them they simply had to stand on their grub and advice alone.  We both ordered a taco dish. Prices seem goldilocks not too cheap and not too high.   The tacos were okay, as mentioned in other reviews it's a little subpar but that's what I have come to expect in LV.   But keeping water flowing in my glass shouldn't be that difficult.   Now the Border Grill was a bit higher in price but oh my gosh it was so good.  It was different but top notch... To me the quality exceeded the price.    I'm glad we tried it, just wish it was worth 5 stars.",

My sandwich was dry and sadly no flavor whatsoever and my husband's burger patty was burnt.  We also ordered mojitos which were good and fresh.  My reasons for the one star are; we were highly disappointed in our meals, our server spent most of her time complaining about how hard her day was and didn't offer to remedy the situation after we commented on our food and after $125 spent for good chicken wings and a couple of mojitos let's just say WOW that was disappointing.",

The fries were great, they give you many different types of fries all seasoned very well. My dad had the Montley Que burger which he said was delicious. The western barbecue themed ambiance was awesome as well. All around a good experience.",

Service would be my only knock. Slow service and we had to beg for ranch since everything came with a side of blue cheese. Bloody Mary was pretty good. We sat outside and didn't have to wait long, but as we were leaving the line was super long and plenty of open tables..I guess not enough servers? I would eat here again. It's also pricey, but so is everything in vegas. Bring your total rewards card, they take a buck off every item of you show the card.",

Took way to long to get drinks. We ordered I got the pulled pork sandwich and I liked it it was good just very messy. My son got the burger and said it was ok. Wife got the chili and liked it. My other son got the BBQ brisket for $33 and have to say almost all fat. 2 slices of beef and 2/3 was FAT told waitres and her responce was ya the brisket has a lot of fat. Tell you what for $33 they should give 4 slices not 2 with all fat. Very disappointed.  Seasoned fries were good.",

Waited on right away for drinks and we were already to order.  Food came out fast.  Wife and son had the Motley Que pulled pork.  Teenager thought it was great, but my wife thought for all his talk about bold flavors it might have been a little bland.  Daughter had a cheeseburger that was very big and cooked perfectly.  All of them got fries 4 ways and were pleased.  My 16 year old got the Double Barrel BBQ Wings and didn't find them tasty and didn't have enough heat.    I had the Italian Deli Salad and it ranks up there on one of the best I have had.  The \"bowl\" is made of a thick piece of smoked provolone wrapped in prosciutto.  Plenty of different types of olives, cheese and dried sausage on the side.  I wasn't that hungry to start, but ate every last bite of a large salad.  Wish I went there when I was hungry.  So one teenager didn't care for it, wife and daughter thought it was OK and the other teen and I had a great meal.  In Vegas I thought it was a good value.",

We had to ask for salt and pepper but were handed 2 peppers shakers. We told our server we were going to share but he did not bring an extra plate. The 4$ coffee did not get refilled until we were ready to leave. The 10$ mimosa was very good!! We would not go back for breakfast but the lunch and dinner menus look pretty tempting!",

The server acted as if he didn't want to be there. He was very unenthusiastic, drab and unresponsive. We had to asked several times for simple things. He didn't inquire if we had ever been there before so he could tell us about the place, specials and offer suggestions. He barely spoke a word to us the whole time we were there. I guess he didn't care because the size of our party meant his tip was automatically included, which amounted to about $35.   On to the food. My kids ordered the Double BBQ wings. They were presented without the sauce on them. The sauce was on the side in a cup. You had to dip them. The wings by themselves were dry and overcooked. The sauce taste like a plain out of the bottle BTQ sauce, nothing special.   A few of us had burgers which were dry and over cooked. I was told they would be medium well but they were over well. I had the bacon Mac n cheese burger. The mac n cheese was dry also.   Basically everything was over cooked and disgusting. The kids didn't even like the so called fries that come with the burgers.   I hope Guy knows that his name is being tarnished by this location with the bad service and products that they are giving the customers. I know we will not be going back or to any of his other establishments. He needs to pay it a visit and demand better.",

I am a huge fan of Guy Fieri, and his show Triple D (Diners, Drive-Inns, and Dives). With that being said, I had high expectations for his restaurant.  The service was O.K. My friends and I was hungry and staying in a nearby hotel. I was looking forward to going to a \"Guy Fieri\" restaurant, and just so happens this restaurant was two hotels down (in the Linq.) The wait was about 45 minutes during dinnertime. After we were seated, we waited between 5 - 10 minutes  to get our water. Anytime we needed something, we had to flag down a waiter.   The food was average. The waiter recommended the \"Vegas Fries.\" Our whole table tried a couple of fries each and we did not finish them. They were served cold, and we pretty salty.  We also ordered the BBQ chicken wings. I really enjoyed the chicken wings. The were brined before served and gave it a lot of flavor, and the ranch sauce it was served with was awesome. For the entree, I had the beef brisket. My portion of the brisket was a bit chewy and stringy. It says on the menu that it was cooked for 14 hours so I expected it to be more tender.",

It was a quick hi, what can I get you, no name tag, no introduction at all, but again the bar was busy.  Beer on tap $7 and ice cold, I am fine with that. My wife ordered a specialty drink that was good, but not $12 good. Ice cubes are humongous so that filled most of the glass.

She tried ordering a hot chocolate, they don't have it on menu. Fine, no biggie, a little odd but we ordered something else. Food came out promptly, and it looked amazing.  Unfortunately and extremely disappointing, the food was bland!  How can something that looks sooo good and has so many ingredients lack so much flavor. Moms burrito lacked something as well....flavor. Bummer! Nothing against the staff, they were great but I wouldn't be back or give my recommendation. If the food's no good, what's the point!",

Overpriced food and shitty ass waitress. Sometimes I wish gratuity wasn't included for large parties, because I feel like you just don't get the service you deserve.   Husband and I shared the brisket, which was $34 for a plate and totally not worth it. It was overcooked. My niece got the chicken alfredo for $29, also a big disappointment. Truffle fries weren't a big hit at all. My kids got the Original ringer burger for $19 and it wasn't anything special.   To our waitress, I wish I got your name. You seemed stressed as unhappy tonight. No smiles and also, no thank you's...Your helper however bringing out our drinks, was smiling and very inviting. He deserved that $44 tip, not you.",

You can choose to sit inside or outside on their large patio. The service is top notch, including a manager walking around making sure everyone is enjoying their food and overall experience.   The menu included things like burgers, wings, and tacos. Their entrees are large portions so you can easily share. We started out with the Righteous Onion Rings. The sauce served with this is outstanding. Then for my main meal I shared the Mayor of Flavortown Burger. This was the best burger I have ever put in my mouth. The size alone is outstanding. It has a blanket of seasoned pastrami and Swiss with a seed slaw and dill pickles served with a pretzel bun. This made me very happy! I tried a bite if my sons Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger. I can't believe he almost ate the whole thing. It is so massive and delicious.   You will leave very full and completely satisfied. They also have a great variety of about 16 craft beers and wine from Sonoma County. This is a must try if you are in Las Vegas.",

The Quad fries are flavorful but a little off. Today I had a ceasar salad which was ok but was served on a giant cruton wheel (probably 5\" in diameter). Seemed a bit wasteful since the salad also came with croutons...also, the salad had too much dressing. i got fish tacos last time and they were just OK and have since been removed from the menu. The menu seems to change frequently too. Overall, giant portions, decent food, desserts are huge but blow you away!",

They had a nice kick and good flavor. The service was good, not a long wait for food. Prices were equal to quality and portion of food. I highly recommend if you are looking for good wings and burgers.",

And asked for the meat on the side ( Im Vegetarian).. It came perfect.... Better than we expected.  So flavor wise... It was good... Not awesome.. Just good. I also ordered a veggie burger.. Which I had heard so much about... Honestly it looked amazing... So beautiful!  The whole plate was beautiful!  They serve it with 3 different kind of fries... And let me tell you it can feed two people...lol !!! No joke.. So on to flavor.... So here is where the disappointment sets in.. Its was awful... The supposed bean pattie tasted gross... Mushy..like a fried hummus pattie.. No flavor at all.... I was so disappointed!!! My girlfriends said their food was ok... All 3 of us voted that we wouldn't make this a regular spot for us... (A definite no).. I really had high expectations for that buger... I cant seem to find a good veggie burger... Anyways... Presentation was on point... Lots of thought has gone in... Maybe more should be put into to the flavor and taste.   Sidenote: our waitress was beautiful and super amazing.. Loved her service and attitude!!! A++++ on that.

The dipping sauces brought out the sweetness of the lobster meat.   I ordered the Bacon Mac'N'Cheese burger, noted on the menu that it was voted the best burger in Las Vegas by Seven Magazine...well, I can honestly say that it was as the best burger I have ever had in Las Vegas, so it gets my vote too!  The burger is huge, must be eaten Guy Style with my elbows out.  With all of those toppings, I thought it would be a jumbled mess of flavor and it wasn't.  I could taste each topping on this burger.  Plus, the burger was cooked wonderfully, just the right amount of crispiness to it from the flattop.    Good meal, a bit pricey...but worth it.",

Maybe cut up the lettuce before serving and the chicken was so dry, I had to dip it in ranch. My kids plane cheeseburgers were greasy, flat and salty no one wanted them. The lobster tacos were nothing to rave about. Go to Javier's in Aria! I watch this dude on tv and I was thinking we'd get something spectacular for the price. NOPE!! A Nathan's bacon cheeseburger was  Tastier than this place and the chicken Caesar salad at Bonannos at the Luxor food court was huge and good! . Never again at Guys, sorry not sorry....",

We visited this restaurant for lunch and there was no wait for a table. Our waiter Gregory was awesome and gave us great suggestions from the menu. Feeling overwhelmed with all this deliciousness, I started with a True ginger cocktail.  We ordered and loved: buffalo wings and trash can nachos. The house smoked pork on the nachos were amazing! The wings are brined and roasted before frying which made them extra tasty! Delicious appetizers and well worth a visit to this restaurant. I'd like to return to order one of their main dishes and more of those trash can nachos!",

    "text": "Eh this place was totally average. Maybe less and quite disappointing since I'm a huge fan of Guy Fieri's.   Our table ordered the famous and popular Mac and cheese burger, the lobster tacos, and the pulled pork sandwich.   Top rated Mac and cheese burger of Las Vegas ? -- who voted for this burger? Because it definitely was NOT good. Mac and cheese was super bland and hard. We ordered the patty medium rare.. and it was about medium/well done. No flavor whatsoever. It was definitely not the best burger. The assorted fries that it came with was old, stale, and over fried. - NOT TASTY AT ALL.   Lobster tacos- delicious, everything about it. And the side of dirty rice was good as well.   Pulled pork sandwich came with fries as well. It was dry and also had no flavor. Still had half the sandwich left when we left. - don't try it.   To too it all off the service was probably the worse. We weren't helped at all besides our order being taken. Our server never checked up on us besides giving us the check.   Wouldn't come here again.",

Came here for the late night happy hour where $20 gets you a beer and burger.   I had the black bean burger which arrived room temperature without a toasted bun and almost no mayo. It was dry and unflavorful.   My boyfriend ordered the Mac and cheese burger. They didn't ask him how he wanted his burger cooked which should have been the first sign that it wasn't going to be great, but his burger also came out room temperature and well cooked. Disappointing.   With so many great restaurants on the Strip, don't waste your time or money on this place.   FYI: be careful of their up-sells. My boyfriend admitted he has Celiac Disease and our server said they'd make his meal gluten free. She didn't mention that she was going to charge an extra $5 to do so. We felt manipulated.",

My wife and I were turned away at 11:50pm stating they were closed, while several staff were sitting around with drinks at a table shooting the bull, very rude and inattentive. We like to go to places Guy shows on DDD but his restaurant was a big flop! Needs better training for staff. We witnessed a customer asking for straws and the server went to a table that just left and picked up two straws unused but on a dirty table with food still, picked them up bare handed and gave them to the customer who was asking for them. He (the customer) was appalled and dropped them on the table and didn't use them, he was so stunned that I apologized to him and I don't even work there!! Guy bring in  new manager/supervisor that instills your values. Big fail!!!",

See pics of what we ordered.  Everyone enjoyed what we got though proclaimed nothing was extraordinary...just good. Which is fine. It all came out in good time without a long wait. Drinks were innovative and very well crafted. I do want to call out the young man who bussed our table...sadly his name has gotten away from me...but he was amazing...he was so energetic and special. He offered to take our picture, he was regularly at our table assisting with dishes, full of smiles and kindness...truly an asset to the restaurant. I expect we'll be back.",

    "text": "When I arrived at the Linq this morning I thought as I walked past this joint; wow that would be a bad ass place to eat!  You know what it was better than I expected. Deciding it was a great day to lounge by the pool here at the Linq the memory of this restaurant and the fact I was drunk are my reasons for visiting.  I am so glad that I gave into temptation since the food here is amazing. And absolutely needs more exploring when I am sober!  As I pulled the barstool out the bartender was handing me a menu. Wow such prompt and professional service from the get go. The bartender was lively and full of energy. He recommended a rum and coke since they were his favorite. I know right slow down; let's have dinner first. This visit stayed strictly platonic and professional.  He poured the drink immediately and as we talked shop; I mentioned that I wanted dessert before dinner. My kind bartender who knows the menu so well,can quickly deliver the desserts and give details about those said desserts. Bravo properly trained employees. Us dessert specialist appreciate this level of quality when discussing dessert!  One always knows the rarity of educated employees that enjoy themselves at work. So to properly give credit to this fantastic bartender I can only Yelp about it! Since I was way to lit to remember anyone's name. Sorry for this unnamed; masked hero! But he delivered this same quirkiness and style to all his guests.  Dessert was on the agenda and as I stated prior it is the main reason for visiting. I had the strawberry shortcake sundae which even came with vanilla ice cream. This heavenly treat was served in the largest glass they could find. This dessert was very special it was perfection in pink; with succulent strawberries all circling the vanilla ice cream topped with extra whip cream (since I asked for more)!  The steak burger was fantastic too; but I took this one home. When I got home had half the burger since the portion was so large; or maybe because I eat less now. Either way it was a really good burger and silenced my burger craving for now! The furry dog got the other half. Will I return here. Of course; this burger establishment is on my special forever forbidden bookmark list. Sounds tantalizing no. That's because it was!  Go out to the Linq and try for yourself; you will not be disappointed. The decor of the restaurant is so loud and in your face; like a biker bar meets upscale with a twist of wicked lime! Now you go be the judge and find that diamond in the towels bartender; he will take good care of you!",

Bright out a drink but the ice was melted.  Vegas in 100 degrees. The trash can nachos are usually great.  This time they were soggy. Our food came out quickly so I'm assuming the nachos had been sitting a while. All the cheese was cold and hard and the toppings were lacking. The meat was also dried up. The mac and cheese burger was lacking in flavor and the meat was also overcooked. Very disappointed. This use to be one of our favorite places.  Trying someplace new next time.",

The food...it's Guy Fieri what do you expect, phenomenal. From the trash can nachos to the sliders, you can't go wrong.  The beer selection isn't amazing but it works and I have no complaints.  Prices are also not bad either. You really can't go wrong stopping into this on the strip fill up station.  Great job Guy !",

As a Flavortown resident and loyalist this place was a must.   Great food and drink options.  Guy Fieri has been known to wander in from time to time. His staff knows that one slip up will have them out of the business for life. He commands respect and expects quality food and service every time. And he is not afraid to slap someone if they make a mistake.   A must in Vegas!",

Of course the prices are high like all places in Vegas but this is NOT worth the $100+ you will spend. We had a bacon wrapped shrimp app, lobster bites app, and a Greek salad with hummus in it. None of the three were worth the money. I tweeted @guyfieri and he does not respond. Fav places were Yard Bird in the Venetian and Black Tap burgers.",

We started with an order of Guy-talian Fondue Dippers: 8 pepperoni-wrapped breadstick twists served alongside smoky provolone + sausage cheese dip.  It was delicious and there was plenty of cheese, but the breadsticks were pretty skinny.  II was excited about the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger w/fries that I ordered.  Unfortunately it did not taste like a $20 burger.  I think it would have been much better had I asked for the Mac-N-Cheese on the side, as it did not enhance the burger at all.  Also, I did not care for the fries (a mixture of string, waffle and fat fries).  Others at the table said their fries had a really yummy seasoning on them, but that must have been missed on mine.    I like that they have outside seating, with heaters for the cooler days/nights.   It was a fun place to come once, but I don't think I'll go back.",

They have plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating, we sat inside since it was still a little chilly.   You can order from their full menu even in the morning. I went with a breakfast dish, the prime flat iron steak with eggs. It was a really good, thick cut. I ordered it medium rare but it's really thick I would order it medium the next time. Really good seasoning just a tad too salty for my taste. It came with eggs cooked how you want them and fried potatoe buds. Those were also good. The biscuit was amazing, just like it was home made.   The coffee was the only thing that was disappointing. The service was great throughout the whole meal.   Lots of people ordered their bloody Mary's which looked incredible.",

Asparagus was cooked to perfection. With a shared extra side, house salad and tomato vinaigrette dressing the meal was pleasantly filling. Overall, one huge, good solid meal for 2 people.   There were no issues providing a second plate to share the meal. Meals over $30 are huge.  The restaurant is casual, very busy, noisy, and bustling with activity.

Ordered a bar special drink Kick'd up Caddy with Patron Tequilia, Grand Marnier, Lime and spicy jalapeno's were floating on top and the rim was dusted with spiced salt - which was like chilli powder, salt and something else I just can't put my finger on.....but BLOW your socks off good ! Every sip was better and better ! So good that I had to have THREE ... I'm making that at home for sure - thanks Guy !   Order Tuna Sashimi Tacos and they had fresh Tuna and a mango salsa with creme and a wonton wrapper as the taco shell served with fresh lines and some radish. They were amazing and only 4 very small tacos. Wish you could order that with something else small for lunch cause they were very small - but it was only an appetizer. So after my second drink I ordered the Triple T fries with Truffles, Gouda and a truffle drip, OMG that was the best plate of French  fries that I ever ate (beats EARL'S truffle fries) thin little shoestring fries with truffle oil and very fine shredded Gouda on top with a mayo and truffle oil dip - all was absolutely amazing. I couldn't even make a dent in the fries. If I was home would have taken a doggie bag on those for sure ! Out of this world good.    The place is a great buzz - music was just right and not too loud at all and played fantastic music !!!! The bar like most was busy with action and a great patio outside with heaters !  I did expect more on the menu from Guy, but I was not at all disappointed. So many chefs have their own places now that they never come to, but you buying their concept of food, decor and the whole package knowing it is the True essence of them - at least that's my thought after three drinks !   Awesome place - wish it was closer to home !!   So glad I came here to enjoy and after three drinks I will waddle my way back to the hotel to burn this off for sure !!",

I do want to return and order something else... we had the buffalo wings that were nice with the wasabi and blue cheese dressing, I wish I could remove the wasabi sometimes from it, had to order ranch to level the spice... and the Vegas fries, I wanted a little bit more on them, they where spicy but simple and very little blue cheese crumbles, had to ask for more. We had an Arnold Palmer for drinks that were very good indeed.",

You have GOT TO try their famous Big Eats beef brisket slow smoked for 14 freakin' hours piled high on toasted garlic toast.   I usually like to order my dishes with the sauces on the side. I ordered mine with the BBQ chipotle sauce on the side because I have this compulsive need to control my sauce distribution every time I open my mouth. And eat. Get your mind off the gutter silly.   On a very serious note once they put that big plate in front of you, promise me you'll pick out two pieces of fries FIRST and I guarantee you will have one of the BEST food orgasms in your life.   I'M GOIN' BACK! Their fries was delicious. Did I say that already? And I'm not even a \"Fries\" kinda gal! LOVE THIS PLACE!",

    "text": "There are times I wished there would be an \"Undercover Boss\" episode about restaurants I've been disappointed in, but rarely more than this time. Can you imagine Guy dressed in a suit with sensible hair, trying to pass as a traveling businessman? It would not only be the best \"Undercover Boss\" ever, but Guy would be able to correct some glaring issues with this restaurant.   I suspect Guy would be happy with the food. My family got the Mac and Cheese Burgers, turkey sandwich, and chicken wings, and all were excellent.   But, the problems started before we sat down. It wasn't particularly busy when we went, but there were no outdoor seats, which was okay, so we asked for a booth. We were told it would be about 10 minutes to clear a table. Wait...what?? The table was cleared in about 2 minutes, and it sat there until we told the hostess,  who said she had to check to see if it was okay for us to sit down (??) After a few more minutes, we got to sit down. My wife and daughter added Caesar salads to their meal, and we were told we'd have to eat it with the meal (??). My wife asked if she could have it before, and the waitress said she'd have to check with the cooks to see if it was okay to serve before the meal (???). We did get to have them before the meal at least.  When the order arrived, my wife saw that my son and I had sides of fries with our burgers, and she wanted to add a side of fries with her meal. A colossal basket of fries showed up later,  and she said that she wanted a side like the kind we had. The waitress said that, oh, no, there's only one size. When we asked to take it back, she got a forced smile on her face, and stood there without saying anything. It was obvious she didn't want to take it off the bill because she was concerned about how a smaller bill would result in a smaller tip. We had to ask for a manager, who took it off the bill and eventually agreed to give us a free sandwich.  At what point in the baffling dinner service would Guy have ripped off the fake wig to reveal who he really is? As I mentioned, the food was great, but the service makes the $100+ we spent on 4 sandwiches feel like a rip-off. When I think of Guy Fieri, I think of an awesome dude I'd like to hang out with. I'd think he'd want that same feeling when you go to his restaurants.",

She seemed like she hated her job to the max! Please tell me why Guy has people like that working in his restaurant?? Like I'm sure there's so many more people you could possibly hire there that would actually like their job!  Honestly... management!!! Hire better people that actually want to work there.  We specifically asked the bartender what was the top food at this location. And she didn't seem to care to talk about it. This is where she should of sold me on something ?? But no.. nothing.  We ordered a $22 burger honestly taste like normal bar food you'd get down the street from your house.  I'm so unimpressed. I love watching Guy on TV! He's super great!! But I really think his staff & his kitchen is completely lacking. I felt it could of been so much better!! Please management!! Get a better staff to work for your company. This is such a bad representation of Guy.. honestly I'd never come back into his restaurant/restaurants.",

It was one of 3 times we saw her in the 2 hours it took to finally eat here. Flavortown sure wasn't the goal here, as I would rather hit up a McDonalds to have the same quality burger. I got better service on my spirit airlines flight out here from DFW, and that is a story for another time. They deserve negative stars honestly, bc this meal just negatively affected my life. 2 hours for a damn McDonalds type burger? How the hell do you do that on a Saturday afternoon and a regular ass restaurant. Staff is a joke and look like they hate their lives the entire time as well. 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Do yourself a favor and never eat at this place on your trip to Vegas. Save yourself from a 2 hour waste of time and money. Hell if I were Guy I would punch myself in the face. What an embarrassment of an establishment they run. And the worst part is I felt bad and still tipped my awful waitress. This doesn't even include the fact they messed up my order and still charged us. Thanks Guy, your restaurant sucks.",

    "text": "Sit at the bar!  It's fun and full of action!  We ended up being quite happy that there was a wait for restaurant seating on a recent September Saturday morning.  Hungry, we opted to check out the bar, and got VERY lucky when a couple got up and left, vacating the perfect comfy spot for us.  Honestly, this was the most comfortable bar stool I've ever sat in! We settled in and connected with new friends (they even let us try their Sweet Tea giant drink.  (way better than I would have thought, and surprisingly not too sweet!).  For around $35 you can get a giant fishbowl full of about 5 drinks that includes a free t-shirt.  Not a bad deal! We even watched them walk vs. stumble out later.  Kudos new friends!  However still breakfast to us, we opted to go a little easier than that...very good regular iced tea for me, and a couple brews for Husband.  Later I added a  \"Lemon Drop...Not\", which was very good. Hungry, we had to start with the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. (after I presented our Bartender with my Total Rewards card to save a buck per item).  Good thing we had already ordered our mains before this arrived, or we might have been fine with just these.  Huge, majorly rich, and totally off the hook!  Where else would you find pepperoni wrapped breadsticks with a cheese fondue with sausage, tomato and basil in it?  With a kicker of pepperoncini to cut through the richness? NO where else...  Thanks Guy!  Our Bartender was so awesome that she saved our leftover fondue for future fry-dipping...wise gal...loved her and her hard-working cohorts!  Husband's '67 Cajun Sandwich was flavor-town indeed!  I know because of the small taste that he was willing to part with. He did more (slightly) willingly share his trio of fries with chipotle ketchup.  Yum to all of them!    Meanwhile I was chowing down on The General's Wings.  As good as these were, they were wayyy sweet.  Would have loved to share them and have something else with them as well, but alas Husband doesn't do bones.  Loved that they were served with crushed wasabi peas, peanuts and sesame sticks to dip the sticky sweetness into.  The salty crunch was a perfect compliment.  I didn't waste a bit.  (you're welcome, Grandma in heaven).    Needless to say we were way too full to even contemplate desserts.  Had an absolutely delightful time...UNTIL a big suit guy (the kind you see in the pit at a casino that is intimidating) come barging over to complain to the hard-working Bartenders that the area was \"messy\".  (our neighbors had JUST left...you know, the ones that had just spent all that money on two breakfasts and several drinks including the giant one?) Our Server had been asked by us to settle up and was just coming back with it when he complained to her.  This made us feel HORRIBLE.  Like we had made her get in trouble...management, NOT COOL.  We were all doing great until you came along.  As they say...it's not what you say but how you say it...and from what we've seen on television, didn't feel like Guy style...just sayin'.",

    "text": "AMAZING!! Went for dinner last night and was seated at a small table tucked away in a corner. Turns out, it was Guy Fieri's favorite table and he had autographed the table as well!!   The food was soooo good. Originally we wanted to order the Fondue Dippers as an appetizer because it was recommended by everyone we talked to. When we went to order it, our waiter actually talked us into the nachos instead. OMG!! Best nachos we've ever had!! Chips were crispy and freshly made, and the sauce, the sauce was delicious!!   When it came time to order we were still stuck on those fondue dippers. So, we ended up ordering the Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger with fries and the fondue dippers and shared both. The Mac & Cheese Burger was the best burger I've ever had. So flavorful and juicy!! Fries were seasoned with this yummy BBQ spice (sweet & salty). As for the fondue dippers....our waiter was right. They weren't that great and we had wished we ordered a sandwich instead to share. The dippers were really salty!! Between the pepperoni, the salt on the pretzel rod and the salt from the chorizo meat in the cheese sauce, all you could taste was salt. Not good at all.   For drinks we ordered the jalapeno margarita which was delicious, very strong and quite spicy. We also ordered the Jamo & Mule which was on the sweeter side but a really refreshing and yummy drink!!   Great experience and would love to go back and try some more menu items!!",

None of these combos work unless you are really, really high. The #Turkey #Burger was a hot mess! Nothing worked well together and the whole thing fell apart. It was just bad. No if ands or buts.

    "text": "We wandered around with friends looking for a late night dinner place after doing a bit of a cocktail pub crawl (a cosmo at the cosmo hotel was the highlight). After such an event, a greasy delicious burger at Guy Fieri's seemed like a good fit. I guess it barely lived up to what we expected.   I'll start by saying there are better burgers in Vegas. Those better burgers are also in the same price range or less expensive. You are paying for the name here. It felt slightly trashy when we walked in, but fit what I expected. We got the famous mac and cheese bacon burger with trash can pork nachos and tried some of a friend's mai tai like drink. The pork in the nachos were very fatty and cut into large chunks. It did have good flavor with the cheese sauce and BBQ sauce. The chips stayed crisp despite being smothered. It was pretty good. The burger was actually relatively good too. The pickles were cut thin and the burger was cooked very well (without the waitress asking how we wanted it). He bacon was soggy though and that's not good. It was good but not great or anything to write home about. The drink was subpar, but after an amazing cocktail crawl I didn't expect it to be great.  I'd say overall, 3 stars. Don't avoid it if the above sounds good to you, but if you are looking for a good burger, I'd recommend other places over this. Burger brasserie in particular surpassed expectations. Don't avoid but don't go out of your way for it",

The order took way to long to come out for just one entree at 3pm. After waiting over 1/2 hour just drinking water on the patio, I noticed no one else was receiving their food orders. The waitress never said anything about the wait & just kept filling our water cups. After eventually receiving the burger, it appeared as if it had been sitting for a while & was just ok. Maybe it was a bad day & short on wait staff. They are definitely not breaking any speed records there for serving burgers.",

I will never come back here again I will never be back to Guy Fiori's ever again! If it takes 90 minutes to get out of your garage you should not have the audacity to charge people!

What can I say. It better be good I am thinking.   What a disappointment. $18 for a burger. Thank goodness my husband and I shared. The burger was really sad. Super thin and no flavor or taste very dry, like someone smashed the meat. We asked for medium and it came out well done. It is literally 1/4 inch thick. I can have 5 In and Out burgers for this price, 1.5 Unami burgers, 3 Shake Shack burgers and been much more satisfied. Ok everything is very overpriced and just blah. We got the man n cheese burger- bread was not worth it to me so I removed half a bun, why waste my carbs? Mac and cheese and bacon gave it any flavor that it did have, but the \"burger patty\" itself was awful.   So the two stars goes for these reasons-  8 small wings for $16. The wings were good. They were small though. $16?   Triple t fries- Perfect fries, I only wish Bachi or Unami had good fries like this. $14 for fries?   A friendly nice waitress that told me not to get the ribs because they are inconsistent. Thanks so much for the honesty so I don't waste $33. She did recommend the burger though. Eeek.

    "text": "Some \"Guys\" deserve a second chance. One of the managers contacted me to address concerns that I shared in my previous review, and invited me to return to the restaurant to make up for the negative experience I had.  Before I begin my review, I don't Yelp for free meals. I'm just here to share my experiences, hoping that they can help others. The fact that someone even reached out from the restaurant shows good customer service on their part, and an effort to make improvements.  Appetizer - Sashimi Won Tacos: Finally, I felt like I arrived at \"Flavortown.\" Out of everything I tried during my first and second visit, this was the best. Crunchy and tasty and perfect with lime, four of these tacos make for a good appetizer or a light meal.  Entree - Pic-a-Nik Sandwich: I stayed away from the burgers because of my last experience, and instead went for a sandwich. Basically, this is Guy's take on a Bobby sandwich. Average at best. It would've tasted much better if the slices of turkey meat weren't cold. Meh.   The Big Dipper Sandwich: This was my boyfriend's order. The house-smoked shaved prime-rib has a strong smokiness. I personally didn't like it.   Dessert - Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae:  It really was a (small) boulder of ice cream that's large enough to be shared. Toppings like a banana with peanut butter, a caramel shooter, chocolate fudge, and strawberries come with this, but I think the fried ice cream was fine by itself.  Service - Better than my last visit. Much more attentive, not sarcastic, but expected.    Other - The wait is over an hour on the weekends for a table. The line to save your spot in person reaches all the way to the entrance of the restaurant. Did I mention that they also don't take reservations? In our case, we didn't have to wait, but it was sad sight seeing people leave out of frustration or having to wait it out.   Overall - My opinion still stands that this restaurant is just a glorified Applebee's, where outrageous food is just served for show. Perhaps the \"tamer\" items on the menu are worth trying, but considering the wait time and hit or miss food, I wouldn't take another gamble here.   Rating: 2.5 stars.",

It's part of the Total Rewards family, so you can have the bill added to your room or use a $25 reward voucher like we did. I got the mac and cheese bacon burger. Very tasty. Served with seasoned fries. Only two things I didn't like about this place. 1) The food was very pricey. But our $25 voucher took a dent out of the bill. 2) The amount of fries you get with your burger could barely feed a baby bird. Come on Guy!",

The bread bun was super fluffy and fresh!   The Bacon and Mac and Cheese Burger- simply amazing. Hands down, best thing ever. It's so good. The Mac and cheese was the \"cheese\" to the burger. All the toppings mixed really well.   All the burgers were served with fries. These fries have BBQ flavors to them... Sorta like BBQ chips. It was soooooo good!   Triple T fries- truffle truffle truffle!!!! Ahhhhh so much truffle! The truffle oil dip was good too! Extra sauce is $2.",

The restaurant is in the Linq, nice setup. The staff was nice.   We ordered a burger, The Mayor of Flavortown and had fries. The fries were interesting they were basically a mixed bad of waffles fries, chips, crinkled fries and normal fries. We wanted something different with burger which had pastrami. The food was excellent. The burger was fantastic.   Drinks: I ordered an Angry Orchard Cider on tap and my wife had one of their signature mixed drinks that came in just a normal size hurricane glass.   Now we know we are in Vegas the home of overpriced adult fun but the burger we had, we split it. Our bill with tip was more than $50. The signature drink was $14. Not worth it.   If we do go back, we will be drinking water. Gotta stay hydrated.",

Both were outstanding as was the service at the bar!   5 stars!  From 2014:  2 stars -  Had breakfast this morning and was very disappointed.  I am a big fan of Guy Fieri's and went out of my way (passing 50+ other competitors to visit his new Vegas restaurant.  The food was very tasty and the portions were good however the service was not what I expected from one of his restaurants and that alone took away from our overall experience!  Hostess experience was average.  Seated immediately outside.  Waited 14 minutes for waiter to approach me.  No hello, no welcome to our restaurant!  \"Have you decided?\" is all I got.  Another 17 minutes go by and the food finally arrives luke warm.  Normally this wait might not seem like much but most other tables already had their food so the kitchen couldn't have been \"slammed\".  No refill on water.  Done eating.  Waited more than 15 minutes for waiter to return so I could get the check.  Tons of dirty tables with nobody cleaning off the dirty dishes.    Note to waiter:  Pull up your pants Sai!  Nobody wants to see your boxers!  This shows that no matter how good the food - bad service takes the cake and leaves a lasting impression.  Sorry Guy!  I am still a big fan though and I will continue my journey to your other eating establishments.",

I seen the episode where they did a feature on this restaurant. I remember one of the dishes featured on the show was the brisket. They showed off their custom smoker and described the method that goes into making their brisket. Looked delicious on TV.  I skimmed though their menu and it seemed pretty limited. None of the sandwiches or burgers looked appetizing to me so I went with the brisket. When I ordered the waiter said its the best thing on the menu and said 'its so tender!'  Well, the brisket was not good. It was tough. It was dry as hell. It was cold when it got to my table. And it had a stinky smell. No lie. What ever spice or rub they use has a strong skunk-like smell. I wouldn't recommend it.  My wife had the mac and cheese burger and she loved it. It looked like one of those sandwiches on the show where its so big you can barely take a bite out of it. She also had the Bloody Mary and it looked like a meal all by itself it had so many toppings. So add a star for that.  Service was excellent. They had football on the TV's and we were seated right away. Its one of those places with a fun Vegas-y vibe. Add another star for that.",

You would think a food network chef like Guy, who travels around the country to eat, would've had better ideas. Poor execution. No wonder all his restaurants get bad reviews",

    "text": "I came here with two Yelp friends, Michael U. and Chris V., to try the restaurant's new breakfast menu.  I was here opening night and wanted to make a return visit.  The new breakfast menu was a good reason to go.  We were seated promptly and was brought our coffee.  There was a question about the coffee they used and the server was a little flustered.  More on that later.  We were brought two cups of regular coffee.  We ordered four items that were to be brought as two separate courses.  That's exactly what was done.  We started with the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy and the Dragon's Breath chili cornbread Benedict.  The chicken fried bacon was nothing special except for the different take on the normal breakfast dish.  The biscuits were flavored perfectly and the pepper flavored gravy was good.  The cornbread of the Benedict was very soft and tasty.  For me, Dragon's breath indicates a hot, spicy flavor.  While there was some heat, it was certainly no Dragon.  But that's my taste buds.  I completely liked this dish.  During our eating, the executive chef, Anthony Leitera, came to the table to respond to our question about the Stumptown coffee that had been asked of the server.  He couldn't answer the question and said he'd send the beverage person to answer.  Before he left, he checked on how we were enjoying breakfast.  The server then brought out part 2 of our order, shortbread pancake and berry pot pie and maple bacon French toast.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pancake pot pie.  I agree with Chris V.'s comments about it falling apart easily.  The pancakes were very soft and the berry filling tended to make cutting and sharing a bit difficult.  I didn't use any of the syrup with the pancake as I tend to eat them without syrups.  The maple bacon French toast was quite good.  Once again the bacon was the weak point.  The candied bacon was nothing special but I really liked the French toast and the bruleed banana slices.  Again, I used no syrup.  The French toast was very moist throughout although the ends were not cooked crisp.  With each dish we received a small glass of juice that was watermelon, orange, and grapefruit combination that was a nice palate cleanser.  During our time there, the GM, Michael Speagle, stopped by to see how we were doing and thank us for our patronage.    Enough time had gone by that the lunch menu was now available so we decided to share one more dish--the S'mores Monte Cristo.  It's a Monte Cristo made from brioche with a graham cracker butter and stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate and served with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  We used the sauces not for dipping but for pouring over.  This was a excellent!  We had a glitch with the splitting of checks the way we planned but that was rectified.    While I'm probably not going to be here often, I can see myself returning with a friends to split like we did today.  The process are Strip prices.  Note to Total Rewards members--$1 off each menu item with your TR card.",

Guy Feri's had just opened so everyone who already was in the place was just waiting for their food.   We started off with coffee as everyone else had ordered Hangover Recovery Bloody Mary. I wished I loved bloody Mary's because it came with different garnish. Some include bacon, jalapenos, etc.  I ordered the Breakfast Sausage, Bacon & Eggs. This was listed as:  two eggs cooked any style, served with two slices of apple wood smoked bacon, two links of chicken apple sausage, house made home fries tossed with peppers & onions & a warm sage biscuit. When I got my meal I noticed that something was missing. I looked around at other patrons and saw it was my biscuit. I flagged down my waiter and he apologized and grabbed me my biscuit. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the bacon was crispy and not very greasy, the home fries had a little spicy and my husband loved it. The biscuit was only ok and I think it would have been better if I had real butter to spread on it.  My husband was hungry and decided to order the Guy's Big Bite Burrito oft scrambled eggs, chorizo & breakfast potatoes, wrapped in a cheese quesdilla with fresh pico de gallo, black beans, guacamole & crispy fried tortilla chips & salsa. The burrito was huge!!!  This meal could have been shared with another person because if not the burrito sits in your stomach and you will need a good walk afterwards.  The food overall was decent here. The service was a little bit on the slower side but I think since everyone had ordered around all the same time all the food had came out around the same time.",

We wanted to changed our mind, eyes and tastebuds. We decided going to Guy Fieri's instead. It was chilly outside that we decided to sit at the bar because the were sitting ppl first outside the patio. Bartender gave us the menu without a word (didn't get her name) nor offered us a glass of water. Sat at the bar for 15mins or more and still not being acknowledged. We decided to tough the chilly weather and sat outside.  Over all: service not good by servers or any staffs but food was challenging. They gave u huge portions like food for 3 ppl per order and early morning liquor mixed drinks are very nicely decorated that will impressed your eyeball!",

The service was so bad. The hostess didn't know how to keep track of who was next and let a group of 6 girls cut the line and sat them first while a couple of us that were next were waiting there for our turn. So finally it's our turn, now we have to sea with the waiter that had a bowl of shit to eat before work and had a shitty look on her face along with her shitty attitude. First she took forever to take our drink order, then took forever to bring them and then of course she took forever to take our food order.  As she's taking the order she's rolling her eyes along with a fake smile every time we would look at her. The food is overpriced and has no flavor. We would've at least hoped for salt and pepper. But no.  Definitely a huge disappointment over all. My husband came to the conclusion that the only reason it's still open is because of the name of the restaurant and the fact that it's on the strip and really people could go be disappointed and just not ever go again, and since probably most of its customers are tourists, then who cares.",

    "text": "Came here to try out Guy Fieri's restaurant in Vegas! Since my first visit, I've been back a couple of times. It's definitely a delicious place to get a burger or a sandwich.  I remember getting the '68 Cajun Sandwich with the waffle fries. Wow, that was perfect. The way the cajun sauces just flavored everything. I also love the presentation, with everything on a wooden cutting board. The waffle fries were delicious. One of my friends told me I need to try their garlic fries next time. Definitely will.   I was also really impressed with how attentive the service I've gotten here. Our waiter checked in with us pretty frequently -- probably about every 15-20 minutes.  Overall, I can say I like this place and I'll be back, but there isn't anything I've tried here that I *crave.* (Except maybe the fries.) So I think ultimately it depends on how long the wait is. We didn't have a wait, so our experience started off great -- but I've heard people who have waited over an hour to get a table. I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the experience if I had to wait that long.   They do have both indoor and outdoor seating though. So if you like people watching, you could always grab an outdoor seat.  P.S. This location is part of The Linq building, which is part of Total Rewards. So if there's a massive line and you want to skip the line, just go find yourself a new friend with Diamond status or higher with Total Rewards. It'll let your group skip the entire queue.",

The pulled pork sandwich had the potential to be a good sandwich, the flavour and BBQ sauce were good but the pork was tough to chew, and the bun was so dry. The onion rings I ordered were way over cooked, they were so crispy and hard that it actually hurt my mouth. It costed an extra $3 for 3 onion rings as well.   The waitress we had was very nice and professional but the greeters weren't so friendly or welcoming.   I was let down by what I imagined to be one of the better restaurants on the strip.",

With that being said, I am disappointed in his Vegas Kitchen And Bar. My wife and I have gone twice now. The first time we went, the hostess acted very bored and could care less about us. I guess I was expecting a Guy Fieri like enthusiasm. And to be honest, I guess that would not be fair to do.   The second time around, We arrived sat down at about 11:30. Our server took our order, about 20 minutes later our server came back and claimed that the kitchen was running slow. Mind you, the place was maybe half full. After eating our server gave us the bill which was printed about the same time we were told about the kitchen being slow. I felt like maybe it was the server who was slow to give the kitchen . Was I lied to? I sure felt like it.",

I gave this place a 5 star because the food was delicious and everything was devoured.  I only wish there was more food.  But other than the delicious food, the service was superb.  I drink a lot of water when I eat any salty related food item, and I was glad that the water was constantly being asked to be refilled.  Had a great time and I would definitely recommend the Triple-T Fries if you like fries in general.  The Trash Can Brisket Nachos are very delicious with the brisket.  I thought it was fun that the nachos look like they came out of the trash as they serve it to you.  The General's Wings had tasty condiments, although the wings itself do not have that much meat on them to begin with.  Would have eaten more, but I was trying to cut down on how much to eat over the holidays...",

    "text": "The wait time was insane. We got seated quickly but when we sat down the waitress took the menu out of my brothers hands as soon as he opened it and left without a word. Then our waitress disappeared for the rest of the evening. We waited 15 minutes to get our drink order taken and when we were leaving the waitress from another section took pity on us and took drink order and we ordered our food at the same time. Thirty minutes later when we finished our drinks and we're about to leave again food arrives. Asked for our check because we figured it wouldn't arrive until 30 minutes into the meal time and sure enough our check took a while to get to us. The food was good but for the 75$ we paid for three of us not worth it especially for the wait. Another thing I didn't like was that the menu doesn't list any drinks beside alcohol although they do have it.",

We went in for Sunday brunch just to find out they stop service breakfast at 11, on a Sunday, in friggin Vegas.  We were gonna leave, but didn't, and should have. We picked meals from the lackluster menu. I settled on one of his burgers and we got one of the punch bowl drinks to share. Ok, the punch bowl drink tasted like melted skittles with ZERO alcohol in it - a total waste of $40! The Mac and cheese burger: bland AF! For a guy that always uses the phrase \"Flavortown\", this place definitely missed the exit. It was terrible, simply terrible. The only redeeming star was for our server, who was good.  I would never go back.",

Also ordered the wings, and the sauce that was on it was really tasteful. I was so full that I had to pass on the dessert, and I kind of regret it after I saw my friends order some sweets! They looked amazing and it was pretty big portions to be shared.  They hooked us up on the alcohol inside the drinks too. You can never put too much alcohol, if you know what I mean!  The waitress was excellent, as she and the rest of the crew delivered great service as well. There's outdoor seating at this restaurant, but I opted to stay indoors. I want to try this place out again!",

Last thing we tried was the buffalo wings which the server suggested which we thought ok it'll be good he was wrong. Weird flavor of sauce and not enough sauce and over cooked.   The only good thing about this place was the ambiance good music and cool location. Our last time here for sure. Not worth the money at all!",

I love my Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  Guy kinda cheated here reviewing his own place for the show.    Atmosphere - Classic Guy style, big and bold.  A bar with great food.     Food   Drinks - A decent beer list and I went with a local beer, Joseph James Weize Guys's Hefeweizen.    Dinner - The prices are on the high end for a meal but they big portions.  I had the Motley Que since was featured on his show.  Eating like a sandwich was challenging and gave in to the fork and knife.  The utensils were just sitting there doing nothing else.  Next time I will replace the fries they give you with crinkle cut fries.  My wife's fries looked awesome.    Service - Our waitress failed on my wife's meal as she asked about the veggie burger and if it was gluten free.  The kitchen noticed the gluten free comments and actually came to the table, not the waitress.  I like that the cook came out as he knows how he preparing the food and detailed questions can be exchanged instead of a middle man, ie our waitress, being involved.  The cook told us that it had panko bread crumbs as a binder which makes the burger gluten.  He sent the waitress back to us so she could reorder.  The order was rushed and only came out a few minutes after our meal.  As team they kicked butt.  Easy mistake with the binder, but because the waitress added the gluten comments to the kitchen order my wife getting sick was avoided.  I forgot to mention they do have gluten free buns.  Future - I guess so, we ended up here the next morning as the Hash House was packed.  Figured 15 minute wait before this place opens was better than the wait there.",

    "text": "Diane and I ventured here for the first time, and arrived at just the right moment to be seated on arrival: about 5:30 p.m. on a Tuesday.  Just 15 minutes later all booths were taken, and at 6:15 p.m. easily 50 people were milling at the entrance seeking admission.  I began with a Side Caesar Salad, although no starter was at all necessary.  If I had been with a larger group I would have ordered the Trash Can Nachos anyway, because I have had them at El Burro Borracho in Laughlin, and they are flavorful indeed.  But we were attending the Mat Franco magic show right after dinner, and I knew that the inevitable plentiful leftovers would just go to waste.  So I ordered a Side Caesar instead, which was a very tasty rendition of a classic Caesar Salad, including plenty of vibrant creamy Caesar Dressing and large croutons.  My The Original Ringer Burger with added pastrami sported a crispy Rojo Onion Ring, a hint of tangy Bourbon Brown Sugar Sauce, Super Melty Cheese in addition to Cheddar Cheese, lettuce, tomato slices, onions, pickle chips, and Donkey Sauce.  I don't know the ingredients of Bourbon Brown Sugar Sauce, Donkey Sauce, or Super Melty Cheese, but they sure added punch and creaminess to the 1/2-lb. burger, so that I knew I was in Flavor Town.  I asked for and received copious amounts of ketchup to add yet another element beneath the dome of the enjoyable Garlic-Buttered Brioche Bun.  Cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, this was an excellent, very tasty burger, with Guy Fieri's touch quite evident in the recipe and seasoning!    Though quite expensive, all burgers here come with an ample amount of Quad Fries, which is another conversation piece in itself.  In a silver container sit four types of fried potatoes: Waffle Fries, Skinny Fries, Crinkle Fries, and Sidewinders that look like twisted ear lobes.  This was an interesting combination.  All varieties presented were good accompaniments for my burger, and the Sidewinders packed some extra heat, like possibly a Cajun spice.         Diane enjoyed her Mac-N-Cheese Burger, which featured Provolone, Pepper Jack, and American Cheese.  The Mac-N-Cheese was smooth, creamy, and mellow--not spicy.  I know, because I sampled it.  Our booth had very comfortable leathery seating with a rustic, distressed wood table top in a nice casual atmosphere on the northwestern edge of The LINQ Hotel & Casino.  But it was cold inside the restaurant on this November day.  Service by Jose was very good and attentive, and our food came out of the kitchen fast, with the salad first, just as I wished.  Our assistant server one time mistakenly poured Iced Tea into my empty water glass, but the error was immediately caught and quickly corrected.  When ravenous for a delicious flavor-packed burger we will surely be back for more of the same.  XXXX-1/2 stars overall!",

And we were very VERY glad we did not look at yelp cause we would have passed and kept wandering.   First: fast and friendly service. The place was super busy but the service did not suffer. We got our drinks and food very quickly without being rushed to leave.   The drinks were good, smidge over priced but tasty.   Food: fansentanceenhansertastic!!! We both got the lobster tacos. Mmmmm mmmm ahhhh yeah. The tortillas were perfect, lobster prepared just right! A bit on the spicy side for a mild chick like me but I could not stop eating it! Even with my mouth on FIRE.

    "text": "We were excited to try Guy's restaurant for some tasty food but were very disappointed. The quality of the food is poor. For instance the ahi tuna in crispy tacos smelled and tasted fishy!  We also had the breakfast nachos with steak which was pretty much a plate of soggy nachos. The tiny pieces of steak were either grizzle or so small it made the dish unsatisfying!  I wanted to taste the beef which I would have expected from Guy's place because everything he eats and raves about at other restaurants on his TV show is packed with ALL the flavors in a dish.  My family ordered other dishes and were equally disappointed. Don't fall for the \"celebrity\" restaurant, there is no follow through in the quality of the food.  One star for the sweet and friendly server.",

They didn't even greet me at the table for about 20 min. And the waitress so 'politely' informed me that I couldn't order yet. They weren't serving breakfast. They weren't serving lunch.  She said 'The hostess should have told you we weren't serving food right now'. She didn't. Ok... So. Wtf did I come to this restaurant for?  Not the atmosphere. Not the service. And apparently not the food.  I'm about to leave. Did I mention I've been here an hour? Avoid this place like the plague. Well, unless you like a loud atmosphere and no food, rude waitresses, and expensive drinks (in a city where drinks are free).  Ok, so 75 min post arrival food arrived. Pretty freakin good. I can't lie. But, come on. It shouldn't have taken this long. Cardboard would taste good right now!",

The hostess was on the phone the whole time, and for each person who came in they told them it would be a 5-10 minute wait until there were at least 20 people waiting for a table. After waiting for 25 minutes we left when they seated a party of 2 who had just arrived, leaving the line of people who had been waiting for nearly 30 minutes behind. Based on past experience Hash House at upstairs is the place to go, this place should have it easy based on the overflow from that restuarant, the fact that it was 75% empty and people were upstairs waiting over an hour is probably a sign. The great thing about Vegas is you can walk 100 feet and try someplace else, which we did.",

    "text": "I struggled with giving two stars or three.   I went for breakfast last weekend on a Thursday morning.  The atmopshere is pretty cool, the staff was attentive.   I ordered a bloody mary and a few minutes later received the biggest bloody mary I've ever had.  It was really pretty good and had about a pound of vegetables on the rim.  A few people around me asked about it and also ordered one.  I was very (happily) suprised when my bill came to find out it was only $10.   I didn't ask the price when I ordered and when it arrived I was thinking to myself.. I'm in Vegas, this will probably be a $25 drink.  Haha.  For breakfast I ordered the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy.   This is the reason for the two star review.  My meal was gross.  The chicken fried bacon was fried until it was almost black.  It was burnt.  The biscuit was very big and very dense and dry.  The gravy was lukewarm, lumpy, and pasty.  It wasn't very good gravy.  It tasted like flour.  They added way too much flour to the gravy for some reason and when it cooled down it gummed up.  If the star of the dish is biscuit and gravy, the biscuit and gravy better be good, which this was not.   The bacon was a big disappointment.  If you are going to bread and deep fry something like bacon (which I'm sure is actually kind of tough to do) then get it right or don't do it.  I would have been just as happy with regular bacon and good gravy.     Some of the sandwiches I saw come out to other people looked really good, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.   I'm not local, so it will be a while before I come back to Vegas again, but I probably won't try the food next time.  I would stop in for a bloody mary though and eat somewhere else!",

The decor and ambiance was fun, and the service very friendly and good.  We started in the bar with a $13 Mai Tai, which I thought was typical Strip prices for a drink.  The drink was good and you could tell they actually put alcohol in the glass.  I ordered a turkey burger for $18, with avocado for another $3.  I thought the portion size was large, and the quality excellent.  All of the food we ordered was very good.  I found this restaurant to be a fun place to have a meal and a drink.

This place is always packed, so expect to wait for at least 30 mins. The restaurant is casual with TVs everywhere to watch the games.   Food wise, the menu is pretty standard, with burgers, sandwiches, etc. The drink menu includes soda, beers and cocktails. We all tried the strawberry margarita, which was delicious and not overly sweet.   In addition to the nachos, we had the Onion Ringer Burger, which was huge. It came with a crispy onion ring in the burger, bbq sauce, and great sauces. Very tasty.",

I wouldn't mark it as particularly delicious or amazing but then again I'm also not a huge burgers and fries kind of person. The serving proportions are quite large though, so that's nice. They also sell house spices and flavoring if you want to try your own hand with the BBQ recipes. It's overall a fairly generic burger place but in a high profile area.",

    "text": "I came here when the restaurant first opened, and have watched the food change in many ways.  The chicken wings used to be lollipop style, which were SOO awesome and fun to eat.  Then they changed it to just regular wings (they said their supplier doesn't do the lollipop style anymore), and now I think they've changed to a lower quality wing.  So disappointed, as I'm sure they're raking a lot of money by raising the prices, but the quality is plummeting.    This time we ordered the lettuce cups, full rack of ribs, and bbq wings.  The veggies for the wings used to be served in a small little basket, now they put it on top of the wings and sauce (????) the dipping sauce is still very good and creamy. The middle wings that we got were very low quality, because the bones inside were broken under the batter!  Not impressed.  The full rack of ribs came with mac and cheese on top of a texas toast, some crispy onions on top.  A small side of coleslaw (that tasted just like cabbage with no sauce?), a couple of thinly sliced pickles (in older pictures, I see that they used to serve the whole pickle...so they've cut down on that too), and the ribs are all cut up.  They were fall off the bone (some of the middle rib pieces), but they were soooo dry!  It was so chewy, and had this weird propane taste to it.  We ate maybe 3-4 bones of the full rack, and left the rest there.  The mac and cheese was gooey and just wasn't good. Surpringly the texas toast was actually pretty good, it soaked up all the butter and fat, and it was really soft and yummy.  The chicken wings still had a nice saucey flavor, just the presentation and quality has gone down.  The lettuce cups were a pleasant surprise, and probably why I still give this place 3 stars considering all the downgrades they have done.  It comes with stack of lettuce, I guess butter lettuce wasn't in season, as we got ice burg lettuce, freshly cut from the complete head, stilled stuck together.  It came with 2 skewers of chicken, a small bowl of minced meat marinated in some nice sauce.  Some mint and cilantro, 2 wedges of lemon, crispy noodles, 2 spring rolls cut into halves, and 3 sauces.  A ponzu soy, sesame and sweet chili. The lettuce wraps were really refreshing, and was a big order.  After we finished our lettuce, we were told we could ask for more lettuce if we needed.  So we ordered some more, and it came promptly.  Yum!! More lettuce cups to eat!  It was fun mixing and matching all the different combinations to make a wrap.  And all the different sauces.  It was quite a wait to get into the restaurant too, even though I held a total rewards diamond card.  I guess it doesn't really get priority anymore.  The service was okay, nothing out of this world.  I just miss the old restaurant when it first opened.  Come try the lettuce wraps and have fun, a little messy, but lots of fun and tasty!",

We were seated immediately, but it took some time for the server to come over and help us.   The food was okay...they have all the classic bar type of food (fries, wings, ribs, burgers, etc). The drink menu is very small. Every cocktail sounded fruity or really sweet. I got a margarita and it was on the lighter side so...it was alright.  The price is pretty fair for the portion, but honestly, I was expecting more...since it's Guy Fieri's place. Tried it once and that's that...I'll probably skip this place the next time around.",

Best part is that if you are stay at or near The Linq this establishment is steps away.  Also had a chance to meet up with one of my friends for lunch.  Since it was lunch time the wait was quite short.  It was my first time there so I just ordered an American Kobe Beef Burger with a VIP Margarita.  The burger was huge but oozing with juiciness but tolerable to hold.  The VIP Margaritas were really strong.  The hosts were nice and hospitable but sometimes they get quite busy.  One of my friends had to flag down a server.  Indoor and outdoor dining is available.  Water is a must because the drinks are strong and the food is so good!!  I am coming back to try out more items!!  Viva Las Vegas!!",

Beer list is also decent. As far as food, wasn't great but wasn't bad. Maybe it was because it was cooked in bulk....",

The food was just blah. As someone that watches DD&D and Guy's Grocery Games allll the time, I expected better out of his restaurant. We had the Pig Poppers(?), jalapeno poppers wrapped in bacon. Those were great! Just served with a tiny thing of ranch, which everyone knows you need more of to tame the heat of the jalapenos. We then ordered the Pork Emporium to share. The bacon on this plate was amazing, candied and just delicious. Ribs were decent, but the sausage and pulled pork were bland. The sides were literally 2 tiny ramekins, one of Mac and cheese which tasted like boxed Mac, and coleslaw which we think had no dressing whatsoever on it. The sides were a wash. The bacon is the only saving grace of the whole thing. For the prices that they charge for their food, you just want it to be a little bit more worth it.  Overall I just wouldn't recommend this place when there's way better options in Vegas.",

I got the fireball whisky wings as my entree, I originally saw the recommendations on the fish tacos on yelp but was told they had removed the tacos from the menu. The wings were flavorful, but I didn't love them. I would consider it more drumsticks then wings.   The motley que sandwich was delicious and it came with 3 different types of fries. I don't think I will return for the food but our sever was great.",

As a table of four, we started off with the Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers and Fireball Whiskey Wings. The cheese that came with the dippers was phenomenal, and we saved the leftovers for our fries later on during our mean! The wings were amazing but were definitely spicy. Didn't taste like cinnamon though, which I was happy about! We skipped the Greens, because lets get real, this isn't a place for healthy eating! We had the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger, which was also a delicious option. We shared the brisket sandwich, which I didn't try, but my boyfriend said it was amazing but had a bit too much sauce.   To top off our extremely greasy meal, we got the Triple Doublemint Pie. YUM! I was kind of bummed there was only one oreo on there and two or three junior mints, but it was still delicious. Definitely enough ice cream to share with 6 people!   Definitely enjoyed myself here! Don't wear tight pants if this is a restaurant you're interested in going to! Defintiely won't fit in them by the time you leave! ;)",

    "text": "The Guy is a lie! Boring and dry was the best overall description of our dinner last night. The flavors were not on point and didn't scream BIG in-your-face-flavor as he had promised. The flavors were very one noted (simple if you will.) Salt was the most highlighted ingredient last evening. I love Guy and this won't stop me from enjoying his shows, but what the heck? There was no layering of flavor! None.  Can you believe I had a nightmare last night because his food was such a total disappointment? I dreamt that I confronted Guy about how his food was misleading and that the flavors really missed the mark and he just dodged each and every one of my comments. lol! Foreshadowing, it may be?   I'm not giving them 1 star because our server Brittney was amazing! I wish the same could be said about the food. :x  My boyfriend and I tried \"The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps\" ($13) - The portion on this one was horrendous, tiny bits of food here and there. But I would forgive them, if the food was actually fantastic. I can quickly recommend the Yard House and Cheesecake Factory for having better asian lettuce wraps - They have better portions, tastier meats and extremely complex and flavorful sauces in their versions. The sauces here were very simple - Peanut, sweet and sour, sweet soy. If I could tell each ingredient immediately right off the bat, that makes for an amateur sauce, if you ask me (the sauce queen.) The chicken sate skewers tasted identical to the Thai and Chinese restaurants in the mall's food court that offer you samples on toothpicks. Yeah it's moist, but it also lacks the finesse and flavor that you would come to expect from the Mayor of Flavortown. The Chinese minced chicken was beyond salt bombed. That's all we tasted, salt. It's funny to me that the idea of \"Asian\" inspired is to douse everything with soy sauce. Lol. Hey, there's more to asian flavors than just salty soy sauce.   We also shared the \"Big Dipper Sandwich\" ($17) - The roast beef was bland, chewy, hard and dry. The fries were dried out and rock hard - they've been sitting on a heating rack, that's for sure. It's upsetting that they couldn't even manage to dish out freshly fried-to-order fries. The bread roll was hard and plain - where's the toasted garlic torpedo roll that was advertised? Definitely didn't taste any garlic. I also didn't taste the creamy horseradish sauce and the au jus?! Ha. Let's just say it tasted like worcestershire sauce and water. I dunked my sandwich and I didn't taste any richness, any soul, any flavor! I see a rosemary garnish but no rosemary flavor? Weird. The lovely (random) ladies next to us from Pennsylvania ordered the same and they were highly disappointed as well. They said it was \"very dry.\"   I'm relieved we didn't order more food because the truth is we didn't want to eat the rest of our food. It was all so upsetting. There is a slight chance we may come back to dabble in his wings and burgers but, man! were we disappointed!   I've been triple D'(isappointed), D'(uped), D'(isgusted)  (All the while Guy is laughing his way to the bank...)",

A lot of times places with a famous name attached to them or nutty publicity just stink, this place didn't.   Let's get this out of the way.... It was overpriced. It's Vegas, It's on the strip, and it has a celebrity chefs name on it. Of course it's overpriced.   I usually talk about the food first, but the creativity of this place and everything inside prompts a mention first. Everything from the decor, down to the forks, oddly shaped glasses and wooden menus is unique. It gives it the extra charm i look for.   The food was great, but small portions. We just got some things to snack on so we had the Sashimi Won Tacos and the Asian Chicken Wraps. They were really good, had some dipping sauces (love that) and cooked nicely.    Here on 10/02",

There wasn't a wait so that we a good start, except that after we were seated and some waters were delivered by a runner, we sat for about 5 mins before I waiter acknowledged us. As before this waiter seemed to lack any personality. Kind of got the vibe that we were bothering him. The place was busy but there were plenty of runners and what looked like waiters walking around so I am not sure what was up on that day.   The food this time was also just okay. It did not come out hot. I started with some of the chicken wings. They tasted good, but could of been warmer. We shared the mac and cheese burger, which also could of been hotter.   We let the manager know about the issues we had this time and he was super cool and understand. He totally apologized and made some corrections to the bill.  We left full but not as happy as we expected since we made sure to eat here on our visit.",

Our group of 5 shared: sashimi \"won-tacos,\" triple T fries, the original ringer burger, and the bacon mac-n-cheese burger. We probably could have stuffed ourselves with another item. My favorites were the fries and the original burger. The fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor, especially the aioi. The original burger had the flavors I like most, although I think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.  To me, the burgers are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite I would want again and again (I still prefer Bachi burger or even Holsteins). The tacos were definitely a let down- super small portion of tuna and not very interesting. Overall, I would only come back for a beer and some of those fries.",

But apparently your staffing issues have not allow that to happen.\"  First staffing issues happen and lines cannot be avoided in Las Vegas. But the lack of real concern and the condescending tone certainly didn't help to mitigate the disappointment. I was certainly willing to pay $20 for a mac and cheese burger, I'm not going to.wait needlessly to get it.  With a line out the door and empty tables scattered throughout the visible area, seems like a manager on top of his game would staff up!  Too bad Guy!

Just boring and messy.  My friend ordered the nachos.  Horrible.  They weren't even edible.  3 out of 6 of us could even finish our food.  :/  Service was ok.  Will not eat here again.",

I would still recommend trying it out. Im sure the other servers are better.",

It included a mixture of fries and one of them was almost like a Barbecue chip flavored fry. The service was quick. I would call it a little pricey, but it's on the strip so we expected that. My co-diners had the turkey burger and the regular burger and both loved them. We all agreed they were fantastic. Guy's is a must visit if you are looking for a great burger on the strip!",

I love that when the burger comes it also comes with an assortment on 4 types of fries. The truffle fries were simply amazing. Right crunch and excellent flavor. Since it was the two of us.. We decided to split the burgers so we could try both.. I knew in my head that the Mac and cheese was gonna be good... It has to be right??  Well Turkey Burger was so good I might venture to say it's better than the Mac and cheese. The meat on both was tender and juicy. The burger ratio to bun was overwhelming larger than the bun.. Awesomeness !! Who wants to eat bun??? It's all about the meat.  Eat the burger the way is was designed. Don't add shit to it. Why ruin a masterpiece? Best burgers ever!!! If anyone can recommend a better burger please do but this it number 1 on my list. Service was also great!! Thanks Chris for the extra truffle mayo for the fries and hooking us up with the total rewards price! Yummm",

I also tried the brisket which was awful and i waited a while for it.  50% of it was pure fat.  Idk how they can send that out to customers, especially for $34. Needless to say i sent it back and got some chicken sandwich, which was ok.  Although the waiter was very nice and accommodating, he didnt give me the discount for having my rewards card.  Id come back for the burger, thats about it",

We sat at the bar because unfortunately they do not take reservations. But the bartenders who helped us were hilarious and very attentive. It was my friends 21st birthday and they gave us some free shots. We first ordered the fireball chicken wings and they were one of my favorite things, such a good spicy sweet hot sauce. We also had the nachos and crispy tuna tacos and they were okay, I would skip those. But the Mac and cheese burger was soooooo good with crispy bacon and amazing gooey mac and cheese. Oh and last but not least we had the cheesecake with potato chips and pretzels that was absolutely amazing, I have an obsession with salty sweet desserts. Hands down I would go here anytime I'm in Vegas at the end of the trip, because you will leave stuffed and feel very snorlax/ whale like and all that fat will help soak up the liqueur from the days before that you can't remember.",

The waiter explained the menu items and told us the favorites which I really appreciated! I loved that the menus were made from real wood, it was quite impressive. I ordered an Austin Tea from the drink menu and it was totally worth the $12. For dinner I had the Motley Crue Pub Sandwhich and oh my God it was heaven in my mouth. The presentation of the sandwhich was spot on and amazing! The sandwhich came with a mix of fries which were served in a raised platter. I thought this was pretty clever so the fries didn't get soggy from the BBQ sauce. The sandwhich itself was pulled pork that was so tender it melted in my mouth. It was topped with a light slaw and donkey sauce piled on a pretzel hogie bun. All of that combined was simply amazing. We had excellent service and the food was to die for. My husband had the bacon mac and cheese burger and it was the best buger I have ever had!! The atmosphere was terrific and not too loud. All around this place was wonderful and I highly recommend it!",

The waitress was knew exactly what I could and could not have.  I settled in the Vegan burger.  She assured me there were no breadcrumbs in it.  However, after a few moments the chef presented himself to our table to discuss my selection with me and to inform me that there were indeed breadcrumbs in the burger.  Now, some people may be upset that the waitress was incorrect; however, I am not.  I am amazed that the chef actually came out to talk to me instead of just serving me a burger that would have made me sick.  Top notch service!!  The waitress was extremely apologetic and the kitchen put a rush on my new order.  Seriously impressed!    I had a regular hamburger on a gluten free bun with crinkle cut fries that they fry in a separate fryer so they remain gluten free.  Tasty!!  Some gluten free buns can be so dry and dense but this one was not.  The burger was done perfectly and the fries came out piping hot.    Would I return?  Yep, and in fact I did - the very next day for breakfast.  I will say their actual breakfast options are not stellar when it comes to gluten free but the waiter again was able to answer my questions and in the end I went with the burger and fries again.  Yes, it was a good enough burger that I was happy to order it again for breakfast.",

The Trash Can Nachos were truly garbage. The presentation was great but after I took a bite, I realized they were cold. The chips, cheese, and pork were all cold. I mean, it's not even safe to serve food at that temperature. Gross. I really don't like sending food back, but I did. I said they were cold and my waiter said he'd have them re-made. My new nachos came out, waiter apologized and walked off. They were cold again! Really? The pork was maybe warmish but the chips were stale and cold. I don't see how if a dish gets sent back, you make it the same way. Waiter didn't come back to check. Really disappointing experience.",

We tried to come earlier the day before, but the line was like a 2 hour wait. Yeah, we wanted to try this spot, but waiting 2 hours...? Just not that serious to us.   So anyhow, since we came so late. We didn't get a full menu. But who could tell? I guess the only thing why I didn't give them 5 stars. For being in a almost empty restaurant...our service was pretty slow. Not a whole lot going on at 1am. But for whatever reason, our sever never checked on us for drinks or anything....odd. Assuming as busy as this place gets, the server was having an off night.   Anyways, once our food finally did come....presentation was beautiful and the food was just absolutely delicious! Came out smoking hot, and the flavored packed into the food was incredible.   So, it's Vegas....a little pricey. But hey, what do you expect? Nothing new for paying over price in Vegas. But the food was really good. And even though our server was not the most aware, she was nice and personable when she did realize we were there. Like seriously, there must have been 10 people there. Lol. And oh, the bartender was really good! Nice tasty lemon drops for me! Very nice.   So even with that, probably the next time we are in Vegas, we will make a reservation, so we can get seated and see what the full menu has to offer.",

The restaurant feels like Guy's personality and we loved it. We were laughing at the servers' outfits, they were definitely his style!   Our server was nice and quick, he took care of everything we needed when we needed it.   My boyfriend ordered the amazing Mac-N-Cheese And Bacon Burger. He asked me if he should order it before he did because just like everyone else, he was worried it would be wayyyy too much! I expressed my same concerns but we both decided it needed to be ordered and eaten by us. After all, we were at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen!! It was the best idea we ever agreed on. It was PERFECT! Just the right bite, the Mac n Cheese was not overwhelming, you can still taste everything else the burger is made out of. My boyfriend actually said he would've liked having even more Mac n Cheese on top of it.   I ordered the Picnic Turkey Sandwich and I was in love at the first bite. The pretzel hoagie was yum, the sauce, turkey, everything was perfect. Especially the kettle BBQ chips!! I ate the whole thing and licked my fingers clean. Mmmm.  I was very impressed with this restaurant! The service was fast and the food was awesome! If you love Guy Fieri like I do, you'll be excited to read the menu, try the food, and see the interior and the servers' outfits!",

Even though we were having a late lunch, it still took too long for our food to arrive. The chicken for my Asian wraps was dry, we had to eat outside which bothered me personally a bit because I don't like the noise Las Vegas is known for. It's maddening. Others in our group complained about the consistency of their burgers. If we go back to Las Vegas someday, maybe we'll give this place another chance. Maybe.",

We had the sirracha wings, bacon wrapped peppers and chicken Caesar salad.  All the food was amazing as expected.  However, we were very disappointed with the actual restaurant facilities and the service.  The restaurant itself is dirty.  The chairs and edges of the tables are grimy and in serious need of some attention from Lysol wipes.  You could visibly see the caked on food and greasy finger prints on the furniture.  Also, our service was terrible.  Our waitress Alejandra never greeted us or asked us if we would like something to drink.  After waiting at the table for 10 minutes, a bus boy brought over water but we still had not been greeted by a server.  Finally, the server came over and asked us, \"are you ready to order?\" This was our first interaction with her.  Needless to say, I never ordered the Moscow Mule I wanted, nor did we order dessert because she brought the check before offering it to us.  This restaurant really needs a disciplined manager to come in and train staff on cleanliness and customer service.",

I sat at the bar and all the bartenders were so fun. They laughed and joked the whole time. Was a great place!!!",

    "text": "I had eaten at the NYC location for Guy Fieri's, which did have a slightly different menu. However, the food was very delicious at the Las Vegas location. I knocked off 3 stars due to the following: firstly, we where sat at a table for two that looked like it wasn't supposed to be there... right in a busy hallway so there where constant traffic jams of people and food runners. We waited 15 minutes for our waiter to come and take our drink order, and it was only after we asked another waiter how we could get drinks that he arrived. When we ordered our food, my husband was discouraged from ordering his burger the way he wanted, as the server said it would take \"too long to cook\". We don't mind recommendations, in fact we ask usually, but it was his tone of voice and body language that made it seem rude. No one checked on us after our food arrived, we where 3/4 done our meal before our waiter appeared to ask us how \"the first few bites where\". This wouldn't have been so annoying if we hadn't seen him walk by our table 7 times throughout our meal already. Lastly, we sat with empty plates and no check for nearly 20 minutes. I finally got frustrated and went to the bar to ask if we could pay, and we were told to flag down a manager walking by. Not great. We finally got a manager, who promptly took our request to our waiter (who still hadn't checked our table) before returning with the bill for us to pay. He didn't ask how our meal or service was, although I am sure from our demeanor he could tell we hadn't had a great experience. We promptly paid, sans tip (for the first time ever in Vegas) and left. I would say the food is great, but beware the service on a Friday night!",

This place was probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant I've visited Ever in Vegas.   Sat at our table for approx 15 minutes with no one approaching us to order at all. Tried to get the staffs attention but we kept getting walked by or over looked. We were not even approached for water as the girl pouring water at a few other tables around us didn't even acknowledge us.   Left after numerous staff members ignored us after 15-20 mins.  Went to eat at Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips.   We realized if the service is this bad, how will the food be & how long will it take to receive.  Will not go back. Rated a zero if I could.",

After seeing a few other Yelpers post videos of the Trash Can Brisket Nachos I knew I had to get them. It is an unbelievable amount of food and a genius way to serve nachos! There were tons of layers of cheese, meat, BBQ sauce, pico de gallo and jalapenos so no chip was naked. So perfect! I only took a before picture but I was embarrassed at how much I left- it's a huge serving and should absolutely be shared! It was a great value for $19 in Vegas!  My husband ordered the ribs which were cooked to perfection and smothered in a perfectly sweet and spicy sauce. The ribs came with mac and cheese which was mediocre and a cornbread muffin covered in cheese and jalapenos that was delish!  This is a great affordable option in Vegas especially for all of the Guy lovers out there! Fun atmosphere and really good food!",

We were seated within 10 min and had very attentive and fast service. Ordered the mac & cheese burger and it was ridiculously good! I also ordered a side salad, and though not fancy,  it was crisp and fresh. It all was a bit expensive ($20 burger), but par for the course on The Strip.  We returned for dessert after a show Thursday night around 10:30. Again, seated within a few minutes. The server that time wasn't quite as attentive (we had to ask for drink refills,  took a long time to get the check after finishing,  etc) but she was plenty nice. We ordered the cheesecake. It was average,  like one you could buy at your local grocery store. The pretzel and potato chip toppings were unique, but it was cheap Ruffles chips - I think it would've been better with a thicker,  more substantial chip,  like Tim's Cascade. I'd recommend passing on this $15 dessert.",

If you watch DDD, you'll understand some of the puns on the menu like \"flavortown burger\" and \"Triple-T fries.\"   For brunch, the menu is really small. Be prepared to wait on a Saturday or Sunday since it's a pretty popular location. Their chilaquiles were decent and the steak was tender, but it got soggy pretty fast as expected. The shortbread pancake and \"pot pie\" was interesting. It actually had real pancakes layered with fresh fruit on top of a shortbread crumble on the bottom, served with raspberry sauce on the side. I was disappointed because I thought the shortbread was homemade, but they were just Lorna Doone cookies.   For dinner, we got the Vegas fries and the beef brisket, which were both ok. We also shared a cocktail in a 52 oz punch bowl, which was pretty fun.  The portions were pretty large, so be prepared for a food coma afterwards.",

    "text": "We walked past the restaurant several times as we traveled up and down the Strip. I scoffed to myself how I wasn't going to waste one of my precious few meals during my trip to one of the greatest food cities in America by walking into the restaurant of a Food Network personality. But then it became Sunday brunchtime, and our group saw the hundreds of people in line at the Bacchanal Cafe, and then we crossed the street and saw the dozens of people waiting to be seated at Hash House a Go Go, and we ran out of ideas. The line at Fieri's was nonexistent, and we were too hungry to try to walk anywhere else, so Fieri's it was.  The restaurant looks like you stepped into Guy Fieri's bleach-blonde head, which is to say that the design aesthetic is very much on point with his brand. We were seated at about 10:45 and were hoping to get brunch, but we were told that the brunch menu ends at 11:00, despite the countless bloody Mary's that passed our table for the duration of our lunch. I prefer more savory foods at the beginning of the day, anyway, so I was fine with it.  For a city as over-the-top as Las Vegas, the aggressive menu fits in very well. It's like a TGI Friday's cranked up to 11; every item has a paragraph description of its ingredients peppered with unnecessary abbreviations (SMC: super-melty cheese) and descriptors (burgers are \"cooked to perfection,\" as opposed to the aspirations of other restaurants to merely cook burgers to mediocrity). Two of us at the table fell for the advertising around the bacon mac and cheese burger, which was voted the best burger in Las Vegas by Seven Magazine, as it states on the menu and the large framed clipping by the hostess stand. Another diner nibbled on the trash can brisket nachos. Why a restaurant would voluntarily associate their food with garbage, I'll never know. Nor why they feel the need to deliver it to the table in a chimney starter. The brisket was hard to find amid all the chips.  Not wanting to kill my appetite for later in the day, I went with the veggie burger, which was a patty comprised of (deep breath) black beans, chickpeas, white beans, black olives, red bell pepper, garlic, artichoke hearts, jalapenos, and oats. It was topped with plenty of Guy's infamous donkey sauce and some fried onion straws. As far as veggie burgers go it was one of the most intricate in terms of ingredient lists that I've ever experienced, and it was, in my limited experience, pretty good.  I'm sure everything on the menu is pretty good; Guy's Kitchen was engineered to be in that category of restaurant that does nothing but hammer your pleasure centers with a coma-inducing amount of salt, sugar, and fat with just a little flair in presentation because it's Vegas and they want you to pay $20 for a burger. Service was a little slow, but only because the server was busting his butt to stay on top of all of the tables he had. Satiated, we paid and left, passing a much lengthier line of people waiting to get into the restaurant for lunch. Our visit to Guy's was forgotten as soon as we left, never to be spoken of again.",

Ask for drink menu didn't get it until after our food came (which we hade to send back once for a hair being on our chilaquiles, and when I told a server who wasn't ours because I couldn't find mine he seemed bothered that I asked him for another) had to wave down someone for forks and when we finally got a hairless plate it was cold and the egg whites on the fried egg were not cooked completely. I asked for a runny yolk not a raw egg. Bloody Mary was nothing to write home about either. And when we left I said thank you to the 4 hostesses (not sure what for the hair or poor service) and they just ignored us and kept talking with one another. For a man who goes around judging restaurants you would think he would put a little more effort into his own. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

We were seated immediately and introduced to the menu by our server but it was all over at that point. After waiting about 10 minutes Michael the manager came by to introduce himself which I appreciated but that's about all he was doing. We waited an additional 13 minutes totaling  23 minutes and still NO drinks, NO server, I decided to quietly leave and go somewhere else.  How good the food may be I'll never know but I do know there are many great choices for dining in Vegas to accept less then acceptable service.",

Lol..anyways...we werent even asked how to cook the burger..isn't that standard,  especially at a place where the face of the resturaunt  has a reputation to uphold...so we get the burger and its sort of like charcoal in a bun with wack n cheese in it..super bland mac with a crunchy burger..my fault for not requesting medium well but i dont think it wouldve helped much..i cant say nothing about the other food but judging off how bad the burger was..which is a fairly simple dish to make, i probably wouldnt return..staff was nice...1 star for them and 1 star for the burger..on to the next burger!",

We were severely disappointed when the burgers came out cold and were not very tasty.  I wrote a letter and let me tell you-They delivered.  Guy's Executive Chef Tony wrote me to tell me how sorry he was and invited us back in for a round of burgers and drinks.  We decided to give Guy's a 2nd chance and wow-Service was awesome, the Mgr (he was new) offered us fireball cherry shots and they were awesome.  Next we ordered the mac and cheese burgers and they were awesome to say the least-Atmosphere was great and Tony the Executive Chef came out several times to see how we were doing-Unbelievable!  I'm a Vegas local and this was by far the best experience I have had!  Highly recommend-Guy and his team are top notch.  Thank you.",

We waited at the bar to order to go and we were ignored for 5 minutes by the bartenders. I finally yelled and got his attention. They knew why we were there, I don't understand why they would ignore customers. It seemed every time the bartender was talking to us he was looking at something else around the restaurant and didn't want to make eye contact. When the transaction was done he handed us our food and walked away. No \"thanks for coming in\" or \"have a good night\". I don't usually care about things like that but the whole experience was very weird. Again though, great food!",

The bar was not crowded, there were four other couples there and 3 bar tenders.  They wouldn't even make eye contact.  Finally when I got someone's attention, that was the last time I was helped.  I got my one set of drinks and my food.  It took another 15 minutes at the end of the meal to grab anyone's attention again.

    "text": "Wow. What a let down. If you're looking for Flavortown, you will NOT find it here!  I have to say I really, really wanted to like Guy Fieri. We were hanging out at the Linq on a Tuesday and saw his sign. I suggested it, and after some discussion, we we headed over. There were a few couples in line, but it wasn't a terrible wait. When we checked in she said, Oh, we have a table being cleaned right now. It should only take 10-15 minutes. (???) We only had 2 in our party, and exactly 9 people who arrived after us were seated before us. I even went back to the desk to ask if they had missed us. They have tables that are just for 2, and that's what they were waiting on. The tables are like not even a foot away from the next set of 2 people. It was like having dinner with 2 strangers. Really, really weird. I understand maximizing space, but the waitress could barely even get between to hand them their food/bill, etc. I noticed several tables that are in weird configurations - like a set of 3 people who were all sitting facing out, away from each other. Weird. There were plenty of tables that were open, but they hadn't been cleaned.  And speaking of clean, it has huge beautiful windows that face Harrah's. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. The floors were covered in food and, like I mentioned, lots of tables were just hanging out, dirty. When they are a foot away from you, it's kinda yuck.  On to the food! This is my first (and probably last) Guy restaurant. We've tried out a lot of suggestions from Diners, Drive Ins and Dives so I thought Guy would know what he was doing. This is clearly a restaurant he's hoping will just make it off his name alone.  Your choices are basically sandwiches, salads, wings, burgers and fries. The appetizer section was nearly all fries...which is weird because your order comes with fries. A few of the appetizers we saw come out looked really cute - they are definitely plated well. But after reviewing the menu, there wasn't anything we wanted to try.   So, I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger because it said it was an award winner. I mean, seriously. How could you go wrong? But, alas, there was absolutely nothing remarkable about it. It had fried onions, pickles, bacon, mac and cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato. It was big. I asked for knife to cut it in half. I think it looked bigger because it's stuffed full with so much shredded lettuce. But, it was extremely dry. Maybe the driest burger I have ever had. EVER. I asked for extra ketchup and mayo. You'd think it'd be dripping with mac and cheese, but no. The bun was falling apart. The mac and cheese was drier than the blue box stuff I refuse to buy, even when it's on sale for 69 cents, and, in all honesty, you really didn't even notice it was there. I pulled the buns apart to find the mac and cheese bite, just to make sure I was actually getting some. The bacon was nearly completely off my burger, almost like they forgot it and shoved it in there later. I also asked it to be cooked medium, but she said all burgers come out medium well. Hmmm. Interesting for a place that pretty much only does burgers. The burger itself was thin. It came with fries - a bunch of types mixed together. Those were good. A combo of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some seasoning. My hubby also ordered a burger. He didn't even eat it. The waitress joked she'd bring us a box so we could take it home and feed it to the dog. No, seriously. She did.  Our waitress was good. She was friendly, and pretty attentive until we got our food, which came out pretty fast.  Took a while to get our bill (it was $56 for 2 burgers and 2 beers). A manager came by to see how our food was, but he seemed so uncomfortable talking to people and in a hurry. He said \"How was everything?\" By the time we said \"good\" and he was already headed off. Shouldn't have bothered.  The amount of other good reviews leaves me scratching my head. Are they fake? Did they go on a different night when there was a Master Chef in town? Is breakfast waaay better than dinner? I don't have the answers.  There are so many places to choose, I definitely recommend skipping this one. But if you go, don't forget your Total Rewards card. They'll give you a discount. I think it was a dollar an item, but hey... after eating, you'll be glad you saved a few bucks.",

The fireball wings challenge was off the hook! The wings were delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant while in Las Vegas and would encourage you to ask to sit in Chris's section!!",

    "text": "I came here at the suggestion of a friend.  Was hesitant to come here at first, as celebrity chef restaurants tend to be overpriced and the quality of food generally lacks in flavor...GENERALLY.  However, this place is incredible and well worth the wait!  I checked in with the hostess, requesting an indoor table for four, and was told the wait would be approximately 45 mins.  She requested my cell phone number and informed me when a table was ready, I would be receiving a text message from them.  The text finally came and we were seated in a booth.  The drinks here are a bit overpriced, in my opinion (approximately $15-$20).  However, they are delicious.  The drink I had was (I believe) called the \"Guava Java.\".  The prices for their food items are decent, especially considering their food portions are Texas-sized, meaning HUGE food portions!  If you have a player's card, the menu items come out to a dollar cheaper.  If you're active/retired military, your food bill will come out to 20% less.  I ordered their chili bowl.  The chili had the right amount of kick to it and was topped with a very tasty corn bread muffin.  Despite having to ask for our water glasses to be refilled, our waiter was very patient and friendly with our party.  The bill for our dinner didn't break the bank, but I believe it was still worth it, considering the amount of food served with your order.  If you're into BBQ, this is the place to come!",

First my daughter called yesterday morning to make a reservation, and they told her she would have to give them a credit card to hold  one. Knowing that was odd she obviously didn't. This isnt a 5 star restaurant. We went anyway that evening and expected to wait, but never anticipated what was in store for us later. We ordered only one appetizer and a couple sat down next to us then they ordered and they received their appetizer right away. We only had a total of 3 in my party and then they got their main dish and finally here comes our appetizer. Oh btw another 2 gals sat down at the table on the other side of us by now and have ordered an appetizer as well. They get it right away and another 4 people seated at the nearest table are soon ordering. By now we have already finished our appetizer and have been waiting for our hamburgers, the gals next to us receive their sandwiches, those other 4 people we notice are receiving their orders and another table is seated orders also soon  receives food. Where in the world is are hamburgers? Even the couple next to us cannot believe what is going on. We are fed up by now, disgusted, wondering why this is where I wanted to spend my birthday. But thats not it. Then they WOULDNT give us the check. They kept making us wait. We asked for a mgr, they could not find one, then told us one would be back in 20 min., then someone said let us get the head chef which they couldnt find him either. So we figured if we started to walk out maybe that would get someones attention right? A stupid teenage asian hostess girl comes running after us screaming she ran track in high school, like who cares all we wanted to do was get the hell out of that place. We were there over 2hrs,. Finally a nervous mgr appears. No apology, no nothing for the terrible service nothing just gave us the bill. Unbelievable. I hope Guy Fieri is proud of this disaster, because it will be going out of business in this town there are way too many other restaurants with better food and much more class. And employees who treat the customers with respect. And after that damn asian girl was still provoking us she went and called security and the mgr was there he was like why did she even call me? I  told him she is a little immature girl wanting attention. She kept throwing digs and antagonistic remarks at us in front of the mgr., and he allowed her to speak to us that way in front of ALL the other customers. So embarrassing. So unprofessional,  If I could have stooped to her level I wouldve knocked her out. Never in my life in a restaurant have I ever seen such drama, and that mgr allowed his employee to treat the customers like that. Tonight we went to Gordon Ramsay BURGERZ  We love that place, and should've just went there last nite. I wouldn't even give it a star. STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET ABUSED!!!!",

Our party of 11 with reservations had to wait an hour for our seats at a nearby cocktail bar.  Waitress quick to take drink & food orders but slow to get food out.  The 10 wings were super spicy hot (too hot to enjoy).  The bbq pork was so hot the eater's lips and face swelled.  When food is so spicy you can't taste it, it's not enjoyable.  Pepperoni pretzels with sausage dip was good.  Salad served in a prosciutto bowl was decent.  Mac burger was messy and the eaters weren't impressed.  Three kinds of fries in one bowl must've not been too wonderful, they were left behind.  Everything served for \"Wow\" effect.  This was a noisy expensive bar but not much more.  The tab for a salad and the pretzel app was $43 with water to drink.  This is a one-time visit type of place in the Linq.",

We ended up eating at Guys three times! Great atmosphere, servers were attentive and excellent, and the food, just WOW!  I can't lie , the Sushimi Won Tacos kept bringing us back! So fresh and the taste was amazing, the Whisky chicken wings, the Italian salad, just amazing.   And last but no least, the cheesecake, out of this world.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  And the prices are some of the best we had paid in Vegas.   And the service was awesome.   Guy!   Great place!   Keep it up",

    "text": "Watch out everyone Guy Fieri's back in town not as a UNLV student but as a Restaurateur! This time he's taking no prisoners -- well, no chefs -- because Chefs Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay should be quivering and quaking in their boots because, by far, Guy has the best burger in Vegas, especially with the BBQ Bourbon Sauce.  My wife, 11-year-old daughter, and I had an Italian themed day in Vegas. We  went to Mob Museum (Daughter thought one of the mobsters looked like Actor Robert DeNiro), Rode on a Gondola at the Venetian, went to a Gun Range, and topped it off by eating at the Italian's place Guy Fieri, who is aka Guido.   We started with the Sashimi Won-Taco shareables. Awesome. My daughter wanted more --- all of us did.Then, my wife ordered the carne tacos, I ordered a burger and my daughter ordered the pork sandwich. All were awesome.The mixture of the fries were great! Though, I'd like a twist on the sauce, say, a kicked up Dill dipping sauce for the fries along with the standard ketchup. (Fryer Tuck eatery in Portland, OR had that sauce years ago with their wedge-like fries)  Unfortunately, we had a problem. The dessert. My wife and I loved the Monte Cristo dessert creation but my daughter had an allergic reaction. We had asked the waitress if there were any tree nuts in the dessert. She checked. The Kitchen told her no. (I wonder if peanut oil uses any tree nuts.)  But reaction was just like a reaction she had before with tree nuts. Her lips became swollen, throat itchy and bumps on her head. (Several hours past till she was okay again.)  The waitress immediately got the assistant manager involved. She was a super waitress, and he was a super man as a manager.  He went way above and beyond the call of duty --- he went to store across the way and purchased Benadyrl for my daughter!   Wow, the assistant manager treated us as if we were Guy, his wife Lori and this had happened to one of Guy's sons Hunter or Ryder.  The manager comped us the $90 bill too!   We left a nice tip for our waitress despite the incident because service and food were excellent.  We will definitely go back for not only the great food but the awesome customer service.  By the way, Guy seems so real and unpretentious like we're part of his family --- and now we witnessed how that attitude spilled over into the attitude of his staff.  Finally, here's a big and heartfelt thank you to Guy, his family and his wonderful staff for taking care of our daughter though it was an unfortunate incident, it made it more palatable for us even if was for the rest of the evening.  We wish Guy, his family and his staff much success with the new \"Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar\"!  See you next time we're in Vegas! We will definitely be eating at \"Flavortown\" again!  By the way, Italians, Food, and Casinos go well together. Bada bing, Cha Ching!   Guido, you know what I'm sayin'?",

I even remember cheering for him on his initial appearance on a Food Network amateur cooking competition show. And then I read about his menu...I was looking so forward to the Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger thinking it sounded as good as it could get.   I arrived with 8 friends and it took about an hour and a half for a table to open. The interesting thing is that while I sat at the bar waiting, there were more than several empty tables around.   When we sat down, the waiter was friendly and delivered our menus then literally disappeared for 20mins. After our orders were placed, the appetizers arrived promptly. I had the fondue dipper....breadsticks, wrapped in pepperoni, with a bowl of chews to dip them in, truly a guy's heaven. The food was gobbled up and we sat waiting. So we ran down the waiter and ordered another round of drinks, and we waited. (There seems to be a theme here). The drinks came, we kept talking and drinking and waiting for our food. When it came, it looked incredible. It was presented very well.   I launched into my burger with gusto expecting to be astounded...and I got only \"meh\". Such a shame! I so wanted that burger to be the end all. It was good, just not great. But it was HUGE! A couple could split this and still take some home.   And then the bill came. I had a beer, a burger, a coke, and an appetizer...$56. The burger alone was $20.   All in all it was decent. And I loved the super open kitchen they have so you can watch them at work. Maybe the public view keeps the cooks from adding the magic because the food, although good, was uninspiring. Then add in the price (given its on the Strip and has Strip prices), I don't think I'll return - There are plenty of other awesome good burgers in Vegas.",

    "text": "My wife and I tried this yesterday. When we checked in we were told there would be a 40 minute wait, plus we also requested the outdoor patio. We'd get called around 25 minutes, but they forgot about the patio request and wanted to seat us inside. We eventually got the patio seating.    Once seated, service was on the slow side. We ordered drinks, I got the Sammy Hagar rum drink, which was very good. But our order was not taken until we got our drinks after a long wait.  We ordered hamburgers, I got the Mac and Bacon Burger. I took about 30 mins to come out. The burgers are smash burger style, and unfortunately ours were on the over done side. The burger is described as an award winning burger, but not in this case. The Mac and cheese was stingily applied and could not overcome the dryness of an overdone burger.   During the whole time there, when visits from the server were few and far between, there were about six people getting a table ready for a group of 15. Must have been a VIP, because it was setup meticulously. I've never seen that much cleaning and rechecking of the setup before. Maybe if they put that much attention to the rest of the customers, it would have been a better experience.   Since it's only been open a week, hopefully things will get better. But with so many choices for good food in Vegas, it's hard to give places a second chance.",

    "text": "I love Guy and was so excited to try his restaurant while in Vegas with the family earlier this summer. We walked in around lunch and had to wait for aprox. 45min (they will text your phone when you have 10min for your table to be ready).  It was myself, my husband and our 3 kids (6, 4, 1.5).  We had the breadsticks for appetizers. They are breadsticks wrapped in salami and you dip them in cheese fondue. This was SOOO good!! 5 stars! My husband had the hamburger for entree and really liked it, I had the potstickers salad and it was also good. The potstickers were fried and I prefer steamed potstickers so that prob. would've made the salad even better for my personal taste. The one and only negative is that there is no kids menu, our kids had some mac n cheese and didn't really care for it. They also don't have any plastic cups or cups with lids. We were there right around the time they opened, so maybe it has changed now.   Our overall experience was great and we would def. come back.",

Like let the natural flavors do the work. My overall impression was a glorified Chili's unfortunately. But they do give you a yummy fruit and mint palate cleanser shooter.

    "text": "I wish I had listened to the reviews We had a visitor in town and thought it would be a good opportunity to try something new and support a UNLV alumni. Our visitor likes Tex-Mex and good old american burgers so we gave it a shot. The decor is what you would expect and employee uniforms are interesting, but hey who cares if the food is good, right? We ordered the french toast, mac n cheese BBQ burger, Vegas fires, and chiliquiles (spelling?). The Vegas fries came out in a plate when we had anticipated them coming out in a tall metal cylinder thing... that's how the others were coming out & we had seen them on TV. The fries were ok, you have GOT to love the flavor of blue cheese. There is blue cheese on the fries but I emphasize the word flavor as the fries themselves seemed to be blue cheese flavored? We like blue cheese but don't like blue cheese 'flavor'. We didn't love them (scale of 1-10 we gave a 2 for taste). Our visitor did not like the chiliquiles because instead of using cut up corn tortillas they used tortilla chips and it was like a plate of soggy nachos. We get there isn't a huge difference between corn tortillas and tortilla chips, but there kind of is. I had the Mac n cheese bbq burger, I figured it couldn't be that bad. Over the top and indulgent, yes... But the only word that came to mind is gross. I tried to pick out some of the mac n cheese or the meat but the components didn't taste well together or separate. Also there was shredded lettuce on the mac n cheese part and that was super gross & warm. My husband got the french toast, it was ok and delivered what the menu description described (we gave it a 5, not good but not bad). We are not picky, we knew what we were in for and where we were - thought it would be hard to get this type of food wrong, but man... it was wrong.",

    "text": "The food was very good. Our server Eric,  however, left something to be desired. The service was very slow. I assumed it was just because it was lunch time. No big deal but it took him about 15 min to come take our order. Again not a huge deal. But then it took at about a good 45-60 minutes for our food to arrive. It took us 15-20 minutes to eat. Not once during the hour or more that we were sitting there did our waiter come and check in on us. He didn't come to give us an update on our food nor did he come to see if we needed anything after our food was delivered. When he came and asked the table next to us if they wanted dessert before they had even gotten their food, we were done. We confronted him about why he hadn't checked on us but offered the table next to us dessert. Hate to bring race into this but the table next to us was white, we are not. He said of course it wasn't because of our race and kind of stumbled over his words. He came back to collect the check that we requested and offered to pay for our meal and that he felt terrible and didn't want us to leave mad. We declined his offer and paid our $85 bill for two drinks and two burgers and left.",

    "text": "Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).  Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.  For \"shareable\",  respectable \"sashimi won-taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The \"fondue dippers\" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.  On to the sandwiches and burgers:  \"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie\".  Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.  A \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the \"mac-n-cheese bacon burger\"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.  Props for service.  Fast and attentive.    Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.",

For a table, we were told the wait time on a Tuesday night at 9:00pm was about 45 minutes but it seems like they have the process down and got people seated quickly.  I got the Mayor of Flavortown Burger.  It was great.  Hamburger with pastrami, swiss, cole slaw, dill pickles, onion straws, dijon mustard on a pretzel bun .  BIG burger and VERY tasty!!  Fries were really good....they are a mixture of different types of fries.  The fry portion was small but the burger made up for it and I was full!      Quite a few beers on tap which is great.  It looks like a smaller establishment, not sure how many people it holds.  There is outdoor seating with water misters with a nice view.    Overall, I'd definitely come back and try a different burger. A bit pricey but it's Vegas.",

I felt like I was walking into an outhouse through a small corridor, but the weirdness of the locale was the only downside to my food experience.   The decor was extremely tacky but it allowed the food to be the real star.   Hubby ordered the famous bacon Mac n cheese burger. It looked scrumptious and he assures me it was. Messy but tasty.   I got the turkey sandwich with thick sliced turkey, bbq potato chips, slaw and cranberry sauce on a pretzel hoagie. It was fantastic! The potato chips gave a great crunch and added a smoky flavor to the hearty savory flavor of the turkey and slaw combo.   The fries were well seasoned, some with heat and some without. All different types of cuts and sizes so it was sort of a whimsical French fry assortment.   The service was great and speedy. The food was tasty and worth every penny.   I would definitely go there again.",

Next we got our entree which we ordered and shared the full rack of ribs and ordered an extra side of mac & cheese. I was highly disappointed the ribs were kind of rubbery, didn't fall off the bone like I like, and tastes like oven baked ribs, which I believe should be bbq'd on the grill or smoked! And the mac and cheese just tasted so dry, like the noodles soaked up all the cheese and what you had left over was dry cheese flavored noodles. I even had to mix the left over cheese fondue from the appetizer with the noodles to give them some cheesiness. Overall the hype of Guy Fieri was what brought me here, I am willing to give them another try but won't order the ribs or mac&cheese.",

    "text": "During a recent visit with some family from out of town, we decided it would be fun to try Guy Fieri's Las Vegas restaurant.  We are all big fans of his.  I think the overall feeling of our visit is that it was worth trying once but this will not be a regular rotation location.  It was our mistake for going on a Friday night on the weekend of Life Is Beautiful.  Is there a worse time we could have chosen?  Perhaps New Years but that just seems crazy.  This was busy enough.  The Linq (hotel) was not even going to let us park valet because they were booked solid.  But there are a couple of elderly and handicapped members of our familial group that don't get around so well.  My dad told the valet attendant that we were going to Guy's and he took care of the parking situation for us.  Cool.    So we get into the casino and put in a name for the seven of us to eat at Guy's. There was a long wait because it was so busy.  And there was very little seating outside of the restaurant for waiting purposes.  The bar was crowded too.  We got a couple of drinks and continued waiting.  When we finally got called up we were taken outside to the patio area.  It was hot and very loud with the adjacent Carnival Court just a few hundred feet away.  It was difficult to enjoy dinner when we were sweaty and struggling to hear each other.  Inside didn't seem much better.  Just as crowded and loud though noticeably cooler.  For all the people who were there I was surprised at how quickly our food came out.  Of course with a smaller menu such as this place has, the preparation must go quickly.  Opinions on the food were decidely mixed.  My aunt and I both got the onion ring burger.  She enjoyed it.  I thought is was over cooked.  But I like my burgers pink in the middle and she likes them well done.  My other aunt and my grandm split a beef dip.  My grandma did not seem to enjoy it much while my aunt loved it with the spicy horse radish sauce.  My dad and step mom both ordered a pulled pork sandwich which they seemed to like.  Most of us had fried with our meals.  The fries were intriguing.  You get shoe strings, crinkle cut and waffle cut fries all in one little paper taco.  The crinkle cut and waffle cut fries were my favorite because you can actually taste the potatoes.  Shoe string fries are too easy to over cook.  And they aren't the best for dipping in ketchup.      This place is a hopping madhouse and very Fieri-centric.  There are pictures of him with celebrities everywhere.  And so many different products with his name/face.  The man is a marketing genious.  As far as the restaurant goes, meh.  I'd rather pay half as much at Red Robbin for a jucier burger and a quieter atmosphere.",

My family of 7 who ordered several different menu items were not impressed.  The burgers looked  like hockey pucks and tasted burnt.  I think the onion rings were also fried in old burnt oil.   I wish I could upload our pic of the burgers!  The ONLY thing worth eating were the truffle fries!   I'm a local, and I won't be returning.  I still love you Guy!",

    "text": "I heard about the restaurant through Triple D and decided to give it a shot while I was on vacation in Las Vegas.  Getting to the restaurant is either a quick trip up Las Vegas Blvd or a confusing labyrinth through the parking and casino at the Linq (I'd advise against parking there unless you're on the far end of the strip)  The menu was fairly simple with a few varieties of wings, burgers and sandwiches. My wife got the Turkey Cranberry sandwich, which was decently adequate. I got The Real Ringer Burger which, while being a good flavor combo, also happened to be incredibly greasy.   There aren't any restrooms within the restaurant premises, I was pointed out of the restaurant and into the nearby casino.  Overall I would put Guy's a notch or two below the typical tourist traps (hard rock, bubba gump) but worth a visit if you're a big enough fan of his shows.",

Only complaint is the onion falls apart when you eat it so I had to slice it piece by piece. But it's really good!  GENERAL'S WINGS -5/5 - Highly recommend!!!! It's delicious!!!! I like the sauce, and having different types of nuts to dip the wings in is a clever idea! It gives that nice crunchiness to it. I'll get this one again if we go back.   MAC AND CHEESE BURGER -3.75/5 - This was recommended by most Yelpers. It's pretty good, but it's not as spectacular as I thought it would be. I'd rather go to Bachi Burger or Holstein's. Deducted some points for the fries that came with it because they were overcooked, hard and chewy.   LEMON DROP - 4/5 - It was pretty good. I like that they added sugar on the rim so it balanced the strong acidity of the drink. The alcohol content is pretty strong from a small drink, which was okay with me.   RATTLESNAKE - 2/5 - My boyfriend didn't like this drink.   Bill came up to $75, without tip.",

If you want pure sweetness - the maple bacon French toast delivers, down home - the chicken fried bacon biscuits & gravy, non-adventurous - sausage bacon & eggs is for you, something with a kick? - carne asada chilaquiles (wash it down with a bloody mary, made to your specifications on their build your own bloody mary form.  Chilaquilas are big enough to share - I barely ate half & that was with help.

But not a crazy wait and they were nice.   I had the Original Smash Burger and my friend had the Tatted Turkey Burger.  The meat patties are larger than the bun. They also come with assorted french fries which I love.  My burger was delicious however if I order a burger again I would order it Medium as all burgers are made medium well. I wish my burger had more bbq sauce on it, however I devoured it so fast I didn't have time to ask for an extra side.  The turkey burger was good as well but not as good as the the smash burger. The portions are healthy so unless you are with a group it is hard to even want to order and appetizer. We shared the fried ice cream sundae.  A terrific idea, since I love deep fried ice cream and think the best one comes from El Torito when they use chocolate chip ice cream.  The idea was good execution poor.  It comes with a side of caramel syrup, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, bananas and peanut butter, pineapple, and strawberries.  All the sides were great it was just the fried shell was not up to par.  The cornflakes were bland and seemed stale tasting.  Maybe needing to be fried longer or something.  It just wasn't what I hoped for.  Regardless my inner fatboy still devoured it. I would definitely come back I want to try the Triple T fries along with some other dishes.   You can also use your Total Rewards Card to pay for your bill so that was great all I had to do was leave the tip.",

Christina and Laura, who works at the bar, are such sweethearts.  They served me well and served with their best smiles.  And I told them bout me being a loyal customer in NYC.  They loved that so much, the manager Harvey was nice to take a pic of me eating and post it on Instagram.  The best meal I had was their Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger.  Once again, the S.S. Flavortown has set sail.  Thanks for everything and wish you Guy and everyone the best and keep on Doing Work.",

Although it is Vegas so a little pricy, definitely were delicious and I would go back for more. The patio also provides great people watching entertainment. tart your review...",

My companion opted for one of the massive burgers and I'm pretty sure it was good since he devoured it quickly!  The only complaint was that the fans on the outside patio are turned on at hurricane force and we had to move before we got blown away. Yes, the place is pricey, but you're in the \"new\" Vegas.  The $10 buffet and $1.99 shrimp cocktail are gone the ways of Bugsy and Al.   Go, have the truffle fries, and you'll never go to McDonalds again!",

Restaurant had only 8 tables seated and still couldn't handle it. SKIP this place, way too many other better options on the strip. \"Flavortown\" is mostly salt and regret, be warned. BTW this is my first Yelp review, I usually let things slide and know that food reviews are very subjective. I wanted to like this place but the overall attitude was \"I just don't give a F*ck here\". For the prices charged, they really should. Like  Reply  Just now",

    "text": "You know that guy with that dashing goatee, the Spikey gray-dyed hair with that grin who always appears on television sampling some food at other restaurants. He owns this American-styled restaurant by the Linq. My family and I wanted to have burgers for dinner and this place was placed in a location that gave us that opportunity. We enjoyed the nice patio area in the semi-hot climate (we ate around 6:30 pm). The hostesses need to be more cheery, they all seemed depressed from their duties, not a sight that guests want to see. Luckily, our waiter was super kind and attentive to our needs. He probably filled my glass of water about 4 times without me asking. Good guy! The food being the decision maker of me walking away with an idyllic grin or a disdainful groan came within 7 minutes of being seated. My order was The Original Ringer Burger (an onion ring, brown sugar BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, LTOP, and \"Donkey\" sauce. After my first bite, I thought to myself that this food was overhyped. The quality was nothing special nor completely nebulous to my tastebuds. Just mediocre. With most burgers you do receive fries. That item had combined shapes and cuts of potato, fried and seasoned in some spicy seasoning. It tasted okay. My verdict is that there are better places to get burgers and fries.",

For a place I was expecting to be slathered in sauce and over the top I dare say Guy allows the flavors of dishes to shine through (with some sauce of course)!  Also had the bloody mary and it too came fully loaded, practically a appetizer in itself with all the stuff they jam in it.    Overall quite impressed, only issue for me was the bill, $100 for 3 people for lunch is definitely up there but it is right on the strip and features a Guy who is at least a legend in his own mind.  I kid - it was almost worth even that price and I actually think I might go back someday.",

OK less choices are sometimes a good thing.  I get that it is Vegas but having just gone to Mesa Grill the night before for a awesome celebrity chef restaurant dinner, I guess I expected a bit more.  My buddy ordered chicken fried bacon and eggs.  I'm going to say they were \"MONEY\" again to be smart ass.  It looked awful and I'm guessing by how much was left at the end that it wasn't good  I'm sure he would love his money back for this \"MONEY\" dish.  Overcooked breaded bacon, rock hard biscuit, and average eggs.  I ordered a burrito.  It was just OK.  Nothing special - eggs, potatoes, sausage....blah blah blah.  Nothing I've not had before.  I would rather it had been smaller and a bit more than just \"MONEY\" (sorry). Our bill with coffees was around 50 bucks.

Not worth the treatment or hoopla! Go down the road where it is not a money grab attached to someone's famous name. I have eaten at Ramsay BURGR at least 30 times and have never experienced anything like this, only five star food and service!",

We were greeted and seated immediately.  Awesome.  Within seconds, Nick the Sheriff, was over to introduce himself.  He was incredible and took great care of us during our dining visit.  Thanks Nick!  We started off with the Rojo Rings to split.   So huge! So tasty! I love the dipping sauce it comes with.  Has a kick to it that compliments the rings.    We then split the Mac N Cheese Bacon Burger.  Since we told Nick, he had the kitchen already cut it for us.  We also had our own serving of French fries. Nice! I love the blend of every style of fry in one bunch on your plate.  As for the burger? Just as delicious as I remember.  So juicy and full of flavor.  I was glad we split it because I couldn't have finished it myself.    It is a great bar and grill that's full of life in a great location in the strip.  Don't forget to bring your Total Rewards card for the $1 discount on each menu item.  Your stomach will thank you for eating here!",

    "text": "Beyond disappointed and embarrassed to have taken my boyfriend's parents here last night. I'm a huge fan of Guy Fieri and was bummed to miss his Yelp Elite event last month, and was so excited to try this place. Epically backfired.  GET THIS:  Triple T Fries are delish, but don't eat the \"creamy white truffle dip\"- no flavor, seems to be sour cream. Oh, and they're $14, so consider yourself warned. The hefeweizen beer featured on the current menu is also damn delicious. Too bad it took 20 minutes and half of our meal to get to us.  DON'T GET:  MORGAN'S GREEK SALAD is plated poorly and difficult to cut up and eat the full romaine leaves. Only one piece of feta in the entire dish, fell off the plate due to the plating issue and was unable to eat it. The dressing was citrusy and not at all appealing. Only Greek components of this salad were the feta I couldn't eat and a handful of olives. There was no hummus in this dish as listed on menu, and the croutons were soggy. The MAYOR OF FLAVORTOWN is a dry burger with pastrami of questionable quality. Somehow it looked like brisket with a dark color and odd taste. The Dijon mustard was also flavorless. Served with crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that looked and tasted like they were from the grocery store bulk bag. Did not finish.  MAYBE TAKE A GAMBLE: DOUBLE BARREL BBQ WINGS are cut lollipop style, which was visually pleasing and easier for my bf's dad to consume, and Guy's signature bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was neither bold nor flavorful, making it even more palatable for a guy who hates spice but couldn't find anything else on the menu he wanted to take a gamble on. Good dish for the person who ordered it, but not something I can recommend.  Service was also awful. As mentioned above, we waited 20 minutes for our beers. That is simply unacceptable. We also ordered a margarita that tasted like lemonade and did not seem to have any liquor in it- sent it back. Should have sent everything back, but at 1AM our options were limited, I didn't want to make a scene in front of my potential future in-laws, and quite frankly, we never saw our server.  Receipt came in an iPhone holder, with the device, to complete a dining experience survey about our visit. I would have loved to. But the iPhone was out of battery and shut off. Seriously?!  I am so embarrassed to have suggested this place and will not be recommending it.  Spending $100 to like an order of fries is ridiculous. Bad service + bad food = bad experience.",

His food however I am a huge fan of!   If you're a fan of burgers of belly busting variety, this is the place for you! Huge, juicy and elbow licking good! They don't shy away from portion size or toppings, piled high to the point you actually cannot get it in your mouth. Good luck finishing your meal!   With burgers to suit all palates, you won't be disappointed. And with sides like the trio of fries you will be back for more... once you finish the leftovers! Lol...   The service here was pretty good, it's a busy Vegas resort and they turn out more customers than you can possibly imagine! You're going to wait a little longer than a quick trip to Ronnie's!",

It comes with fondue dipping sauce which is really good but the breadsticks are just okay.   Nachos- very different than any other nachos I've ever had. We ordered ours without beans and jalapenos. The chips are a little harder than normal which I think is good because they don't get soggy with all the toppings. One thing I liked....each chip had a good amount of toppings. Not like other places where the topping are in the middle and most chips and plain. It's a big portion, three people could share easily.   Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger- on the first visit I had this burger and then my friend had it I on my second visit. We both had the same complaint...the macaroni wasn't even on the burger. When you get to the second half, there was barely any.   Motley Que Sandwich- BBQ pulled pork on a pretzel bun. I asked for no citrus slaw but it was on there instead of the onions :( I didn't mention it though. Nice BBQ option...beware it's messy lol! The fries are very good!  What I like most about the restaurant...the staff. They really do care about your experience! Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming.   Bring a total rewards card and you'll save a few dollars! They sell Guy's merchandise in the front of the store.   Price: On the first visit our bill for an appetizer, two entrees, water, and a soda came to $72.",

Wanted lunch but new I would need to do breakfast   My server was prompt asked me if I would like a drink but I wanted to digest the menu said I will order a cocktail but start me of water and lemon. I got just water  The Bloody Mary you have choices. One being heat 1-5. You have 5 choices if garnish and a protein. When waiter came over I said I would like a b m and started.  He stopped me and said bar tended is just loading them up with what he has but you can cheese protein.  No choice on heat nothing.  It came with a pickle  pineapple lemon olives   Not 5 at all.  I used lemon for water  I ordered the biscuit scrambled eggs with chicken bacon.  It was ok.  Huge.  Biscuit was good. Gravy was good but chicken fried bacon was over cooked on outside the bacon meat had great flavor but large pieces of undercooked bacon fat. And greasy pockets.   The coating just separated breaking from bacon   Again. I would love to try it again.   Decor is rough.  Tables paint is rustic or peeling.  Your pick.",

The Vegas fries are spicy; crispy potato skins with Buffalo sauce poured over right in front of you and chunks of blue cheese with a side a wasabi blue cheese. Spicy and delicious. The s'mores monte crisco was only ok, the chocolate and marshmallow was not hot or melted in the middle and it just tasted like a glorified funnel cake. Really messy too. We loved the vibe of this place, professional staff, nice product and ambiance.",

If you're looking for Diners, Dives and Drive Ins food you won't find it here nor anything like it.  We thought expensive and the food nothing special just heat and serve simple bar food veneered to look special.  Creepy, indifferent employees act and look like they were hired out of Betty Ford. Steam punk fail. Uncomfortable seating and atmosphere. Over-branded to the point of over-kill.  Fieri has a great show with DDD and that big mouth of his, but everything else he's involved with sux. Read that: Everything and this is a good example. His latest show Guido's slaughtering and butchering animals with his son so that should step his career way back a few notches. Same stunt that killed Chef Ramsay's TV career.  5 star reviews are probably from employees or visitors with a Vegas blow and booze blush on and a pocket full of money that have no clue what good food tastes like.",

The place was pretty busy and something definitely stood out about it, it was about a fifteen minute wait and I was starving!!! But our hostess kristin definitely subsided my hangryness. She made me feel as though it was her duty to get me seated in the most timely fashion as humanly possible. I am impressed, I love industry people who are genuine and she definitely was. First impressions are everything and she did great! Will be returning and hopefully get taken care of Kristin once again!",

Bad rule!  To complete this review, the service was good and the staff friendly. I still think that the outside beverage rule in a Casino is just greed. We had to wait 30 minutes and had time to kill (they text your cell phone when your tables ready) so we got drinks inside the Casino (where restaurant is located).   On to the food: We weren't impressed. I ordered the The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps, the chicken was so so, kind of flavorless and the wraps were too messy for my liking, (My fault). My husband ordered The Mac + Cheese Bacon Burger...they didn't ask how he wanted it cooked and so we assumed it would be medium, and it was more medium well. He switched the bun to the pretzel bun, but the bottom bun was so thin it disintegrated. Again, the burger was Bland, the meat, the mac n cheese all bland. We also ordered the Quad Fries (mixture of three different styles), They were good even if there was enough for at least four people.  Overall the experience was disappointing!",

Back to the food.  The Guy-talian Fondue Dippers are Pepperoni-wrapped breadstick twists served alongside our smoky provolone + sausage cheese dip, topped with fresh tomato bruschetta.  They are delicious, even though it sounded strange to us.  The carne asada street tacos are a winner too!  You get four tacos held upright in a metal rack.  There are different varieties but I chose the marinated skirt steak garnished with onions, cilantro and salsa [on the side].  Generous portions for the price and the taste is both juicy and flavorful.  Reasonable prices given the portions and considering other Vegas restaurants on the strip tend to be on the high side to begin with.",

I'm a huge fan of the food network and when I found out this restaurant was opening in town I seriously couldn't wait to try it out!!  We made reservations ahead of time for a party of 8 ( best decision ever) we literally walked in and they were sat us at the table right away. Visually the place is super cool, high end with a rustic BBQ/biker type feel to it. Staff all incredibly friendly and accommodating.     Food! We had a few appetizers strongly suggest the fondu!! The generals wings were good too!! I love that they had three different dipping crusts for their wings before you put them in sauce! Soo good. Drinks were reasonable we ended up getting a fish bowl for a few at our table, came with a free shirt! Can't beat that  we filled on appetizers but still got a couple entrees to  taste at the table ( street tacos and Mac n cheese burger) seriously how could you go wrong right?! DELISH! We topped our party off with dessert (mint chip ice cream pie thing and deep friend s'mores) the ice cream was good but my fav was the s'mores it seriously hit every taste bud in my mouth in THE BEST WAY!!   Overall it was an incredible dinner the staff was more friendly and attentive than I even thought possible! Chef Tony you've got an amazing team both in and out of the kitchen. Will definitely be back",

The 2 tables next to us looked great and yummy.  We asked for extra blue cheese for our Vegas fries and he forgot,  meanwhile our fries got cold.  We left some of the cold burger and half of our cold fries. The salad was good and cold lol. We follow Guy s recommendations East to Westcoast and have never been disappointed.  Shame his restaurant let us down.  Maybe next time will be better.  We still love our DDD choices and Guy.",

    "text": "I had very high expectations for Guy Fieri's restaurant at the Quad.! Unfortunately, I left feeling underwhelmed. Customer service was very good. Upon arrival, my group and I were immediately greeted by a group of hostesses. There had to be at least four of them standing there. They were nice but also very nonchalant. Maybe that's because it wasn't really busy on a Wednesday night and they all really didn't have anything to do. One escorted us to our table and we were almost immediately given water. About ten minutes after getting the water, our server approached us and gave us the menus. He also asked if we had any questions about anything on the menu or about the restaurant. He was very polite, informative, and attentive.   I ordered the '67 Cajun Sandwich and my friends ordered the Big Dipper Sandwich to share. I also ordered the \"Lemon Drop..Not\" cocktail and the S'mores Monte Cristo dessert. The '67 Cajun Sandwich was just alright. I expected the bread to be soft, but I believe it was sourdough so it was a little harder than I prefer. The meats were seasoned well and the hot sauce added a nice tangy kick to the sandwich. I really liked the fact that they serve different types of fries: crinkle, waffle, and string. With that being said, the fries were not hot and tasted like they had been sitting in a warmer waiting to be served. When served fresh, McDonald's fries are better than these were.! Yes, I said it.!! The Lemon Drop Cocktail was sweet, lemony, and delicious. The S'mores dessert was very tasty and served with strawberry and chocolate syrups, although, I would've liked for it to be served warmer. My friends enjoyed there Big Dipper sandwich with Au Jus sauce and left happy. (Partially because they didn't have to pay for dessert..Lol.)   So service was good and the food for me was just okay. It definitely was not the best \"American Diner\" I've been to. I'll have to go back and try some other things on the menu and maybe update my rating, but for now 3 stars is all it's getting from me.!",

Unfortunately the pulled pork sandwich here did not live up to my expectations. The bun was soggy and there were different sized French fries and hardly any there! The sauce had a good flavor but it was nothing special. You are paying for Guy's name at this place. Don't waste your time- it's expensive and not worth the money.",

Do not get the wings if, you are expecting the nice, subtle heat you would expect from a general tso sauce. The sauce tastes like a mandarin orange sauce, very bitter, not spicy. I would have thought the sauce would be made in house but it seems as if it is a Sysco sauce that has been mass produced. The nachos were okay, not great but, the better of the two items. Not sure about this place, and not sure if I will come back. Hopefully the burgers blow your mind, as mine is still being scratched wondering what the fuss is.",

    "text": "What a let down!! Me and the boyfriend are big fans of \"Triple D\" and always check out their site for restaurants to hit up wherever we may be travelling, so naturally we thought Guy's restaurant in Vegas would be killer. We were soooo wrong. First, around noon I called for thirty minutes hoping to get someone on the phone so I could make reservations, after a several tries, and two hang ups I finally got someone who told me \"ummm yeah we don't dooo that.\" The food was Denny's quality at best. Alfredo sauce on the cajun chicken alfredo tasted like some kind of horrific canned cheese sauce, I didn't eat much of it or take it with me, also nothing even remotely \"cajun\" about the dish. The chicken chunks were boring, tasteless paper-white pieces of dry meat. The boys got burgers, which neither of them finished and that's really saying something when two grown men with the drunk munchies won't even finish a cheeseburger. Tuna on the won-tacos was extreeeemely fishy and off-putting, likely because it was NOT fresh. The servers only pay attention to tables they can flirt with (the men as well as the women, we had a male server) otherwise they look right through you. The drinks were tasty but for $14 a cocktail I'd rather go get a booze slushy in some dick-shaped cup or whatever. All in all, save your money and go somewhere else, didn't live up to the hype.  Two appetizers Three cocktails Three beers Three entrees = $200",

So last night I finally did and the flavors were on point the burger taste was amazing. Only thing was it's called a Mac and cheese burger why does it have the smallest amount of Mac and cheese on it. It should have Mac and Cheese dripping off it I believe that would have took the burger over the top. So with that being said more MAC please.....",

No tooth picks I know your probably thinking really tooth picks? Well if u ordered chicken wings or pork you will need it so yeah! Service was okay food is what earned the stars! Chicken wings had a lot of BBQ sauce I loved it the garnish was edible a plus! Staff was not organized which is why our wait for food and table was very long. I was also surprised that there was no complementary bread for us after waiting 1 hour and 20 minutes total for food and table. His other restaurants do. Lastly there is not a bathroom in this place , the staff said its because there are casino bathrooms which to me is cheap and was very difficult coming back in from the casino to my table. Not good guys not at all. Portions from appetizers were bigger than the actual entree plates strange! Price is high but use your total rewards card to get a lower price complements of Linq hotel!",

We ended our vacation with the whiskey chocolate cake...so yummy! If you are near a Guy Fieri's you must try it!",

    "text": "LOVED THIS RESTAURANT! As a big Guy Fieri fan myself, I was easily excited to eat here, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere had a fun vibe with indoor and outdoor seating, and the workers were accommodating and warm. I got the lobster tacos which were great-- were filling but light and not too heavy, and came with a side of fried rice which was good too. However, my group split the Trash Can Nachos as an appetizer, and I'd have to say that was EASILY my favorite. They were a different take on the classic nacho that I could not stop eating!!! Lastly, prices were fairly reasonable for the amount and quality of food. Glad I got to try this out!",

I didn't drink any of it and the server didn't even ask if we liked it (pretty obvious when I didn't drink my $15 drink). The food was mediocre. Location is good, and it's decorated super cool.

Anywho, the service was great tonight.  My fiancee went with the Ringer Burger and a Ciroc with Sprite.  I chose the NY Strip Steak, a side Ceasar Salad, and the Spiked Koolaid to wash it all down.  I ordered the steak medium well and it wad cooled just right.  Goldilocks would have been jealous!  There was also asparagus that was tender and yet crunchy.  The habanero butter wasn't as hot as I feared it would be - although, one bite helped clear the sinuses.  Finally, Stephanie recommended the Double Mint Pie for dessert and we went for it.  Check out my pics!  It was a real treat!",

My friends and I kind of had a hard time finding this place but its inside the Linq hotel and you just go towards the strip when you enter through the back parking structure. I wanted to eat something light so I ordered their lobster tacos and it was really good! The lobster tasted really fresh and they didn't skimp on the lobster either so I was glad. The rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food too! So I'm glad I finally got to try one of Guy Fieri's restaurants since I had high expectations. It wasn't super amazing but it was pretty good.

They did not disappoint.  The fries were seasoned to perfection w/a slight kick but not too much for my weak palate. Serving staff and hostess was friendly and welcoming. Our drinks stayed full even though I only had water and the man had tea. There were TVs in multiple locations with tennis on. There was an outdoor seating area, but I was more inclined to stay in the cool air. The decor was nice, of course skulls and flames a fieri trademark. They had a bar area as well if you wanted to just drink, big drinks available. It was a great dining experience that I would suggest to any vegas visitor.",

    "text": "Despite my direst warnings, my travel companion to Las Vegas had been convinced by a co-worker, (who I am now assuming was a demon taking on the form of her co-worker) insisted that we visit Guy Fieri's Kitchen and Bar while we were in Las Vegas. Now, don't get me wrong, I am fully aware that Guy Fieri is a very nice person, he does a lot for charity and even his silly TV show gives a lot of struggling local restaurants exposure, and from all accounts he is a class act and a kind person. He is, in a utilitarian sense, a force for good.    Thus, it is a testament to Mr. Fieri's famously big heart and kindness that he remains on the right side of the moral balance sheet after unleashing Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar upon an innocent public.   Somewhat muted decor reminded me of a sports bar that had bothered to spring for a better carpenter. The staff were attentive, personable and clearly engaged. They handle what is certainly a 24/7 slam and service was a breeze even with a packed house, you guys are great!    The menus were plastered in what I imagine was a 22 year old Nickelback fan's \"tattoo ideas\" notebook, the prices were fairly high (which is fine and expected in this case) and the choices seemed like something from a grey-market E-book on how to get a disability pension by giving yourself diabetes.    On my companion's insistence, we went for the \"trash can nachos\", owing to the fact that they are theatrically dumped on a plate from a bottomless miniature trash can. The menu stated that it was nachos with smoked BBQ beef burnt ends, crema, queso and jalapenos. That actually sounded pretty good.   Unfortunately, something seems to have been lost in the Fieri to English dictionary. What was meant by \"burnt ends\" was \"fat we trimmed off the prime rib roasts\", crema was almost certainly \"heavy cream\", the queso had the unmistakable taste of 7-11 machine cheese and a single, half-withered jalapeno slice rested upon the top of the pile, almost apologetically.    We ate perhaps half the plate between the two of us, had another drink and decided to head home for the night.    Now, I will not blame the restaurant for what happened next. We had been having about one drink per hour for the last two days, walking around in 118 degree heat for hours at a time, and eating an inhuman amount of foods of storage temperatures in volumes. However, about an hour after eating a quarter plate of said nachos, I became violently ill.    The entire city of Vegas in front of me, we're flush with cash, pretty drunk, and trying to make the most of it. However, we are now in the hotel room while I am giving the earth a refund on what I just consumed. I recovered early the next day, but I still shiver whenever I hear Smash Mouth's \"All Star\" in remembrance of the gastrointestinal maelstrom I suffered.    I reiterate that I am in actuality, a fan of Guy Fieri, we need more people like him in the world, and I think we'd all be a lot happier if we lived like him, liking what we like unapologetically and being ourselves. However, a world where we cooked like him would be a hell that only the worst of us could ever deserve.",

The firewall wings were flavorful but a little too hard for my taste, served with blue cheese w/a touch of wasabi (yummy). No room for dessert. The wait was about 10 minutes, great atmosphere, our waitress was nice and attentive. We sat in the patio. Prices are reasonable, nice place overall.",

So I was a little disappointed that all of the delicious looking taco dishes on the website menu were no longer available.  I had the bacon macaroni and cheese burger and fries. Don't get me wrong it was delicious and the fries had something on them that was the bomb.  So please update your website, or better yet bring the tacos back brother.",

The mac and cheese burger is a delight and well worth the price, while the drink selections are fairly comprehensive too. Moreover, service is warm and engaging, especially from the bartenders who are quite good at entertaining folks with the acrobatic way in which they juggle drinks.   A good choice if, like Guy himself, you're up for a good dose of man food.",

    "text": "I came here for the fabulous Yelp Elite event prior to opening and I had the most amazing experience! My second visit was with Ruben and my brother since I wanted them to check it out. The service was fantastic and GM Mike was just as hospitable as the first time! My most recent visit was a couple weeks ago and the menu hasn't changed with exception of the removal of dishes like the Rojo Onion Rings and Churros. Some of the food wasn't as good as I recall. Service was still great and they're always insanely busy (no reservations).   Brisket Nachos ($17) The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps ($15) Triple T Fries ($14) Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers ($14) Fireball Whiskey Wings ($16) Tatted-Up Turkey Burger ($18) Seared Flat Iron Poutine ($32) 14-Hour Beef Brisket ($34)  I love the concept of The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps because of the multiple options, but the chicken is always salty and the sauces are just okay. The nachos are terrible. I do really enjoy the fondue dippers, but again, salty. All of the entrees are decent. I haven't had a bad sandwich, but there are so many different flavors going on that it borders on too much. For example, the turkey burger is grilled with poblano and pepper jack cheese, and has Gouda, sweet pepper red onion jam, donkey sauce, and garlic butter on the bun. It's good, but it could do without one or two ingredients.",

The menu did change alot. I wish they had more apps to choose from.   Anyways we ordered our drinks, a soda and a beer. We ordered our food when the drinks came. We ordered 2 sandwiches to split. Also we ordered ranch with our meals as well. We recieved our meals and the runner just dropped them off and ran. We had no silverware, empty drinks the whole meal and had to wait for our server for a good 7 minutes to ask for our ranvh and silverware. Still he didn't refill our drinks and we wanted to order speciality drinks. It's las vegas on a Saturday night, we really wanted to drink. Right when we brought the silverware he slapped the check into the table. No more drinks and i guess dessert was out of the question. I'm just a stickler for service and our waiter was just horrible, very impersonal and in a huge rush. I get it it's saturday night but i saw the table next to us get up to leave and they literally were right next to their chairs before he went to clear the table...give the people a minute to leave.   Overall i wont be back again. This time the food was cold and not worth the price. The steak sandwich was good but the mac and cheese burger had no flavor and was cold because we had to wait so long for silverware and such. It would if been nice to have more drinks and dessert but the server made it pretty clear he wanted us to leave so he could have another table.",

Everything had tons of flavor, great texture, and fun presentation.  That what's boosted the rating an extra star.  This place lost a lot of stars because of the service or lack there of, especially with rude guests in the place.  We arrived at dinner time and had to wait for a table for a few minutes.  This was ok because it was obvious they were busy.  We were eventually seated at a nice table.  The music was loud and going for a party atmosphere, but it was the ok loud level most of us deal with on a regular basis.    That was until the party of 15 were sat behind us.  They, the abnormally obnoxious group, obviously were tourists who think it is ok to behave like jerks everywhere they go because \"It's Vegas Baby!\"  The whole group were drinking like crazy and acting like fools.  They were screaming and hollering and making all of the surrounding tables feel uncomfortable.  I know this because we talked to the tables on either side of us and we all though they were acting like idiots.  It got to the point where it was hard to talk to the person sitting right next to you because it was so loud. Im pretty sure several tables asked a manager to ask the group to quiet down a bit.  Every now and then you would hear someone from the group apologize for being loud right before they started screaming again.  Annoying.  Our server was also blah.  She was hardly present and did the bare minimum our entire stay.  We hardly saw her except to order and receive our food.  She was then gone until she dropped off the bill.  Bad, bad service.  Something that really annoyed me was the dessert options.  My 4 year old daughter asked for a scoop of ice cream.  I understand that wasn't on the menu, but I figured I would ask anyway.  I was in the food & bev business for a long time and I know everywhere I worked you could order a scoop of ice cream as long as the place had ice cream from casual to fine dining.  Our server said they do not do any side orders at all.  Since I had already promised her ice cream (thats a different story, but ice cream was a must), I had to order her a $15 HUGE do it yourself sundae thing that is meant for 4-6 people.  I thought this was just bad taste and bad customer service.  And annoyed me even more.  So the food is really good and totally \"Flavor Town\" level as GF says on his foodie shows, so yay for good food.  If I ever go back, it definitely will be during the day because later is just obnoxious, unless you are 21 and in a frat perhaps.",

The batter on the lobster was pretty close to being soggy or crunchless. The lobster was a little overcooked itself. For the sauces, don't really know why the cheese dip was paired with it, but the lemon aioli was good. Definitely used that one more. The fries.... sigh.... basically crunchy stale fries /:  I liked the margarita, but not really worth $15.  Total was $34, so definitely not worth it altogether, but really just paid to say I ate here.   Overall: food was lackluster & drink was decent. Price? Overpriced but hey, also expected. Wouldn't come back unless someone really insisted. This is the type of place you go for the novelty.   Although, I did overhear that they change the menu every few months or so. Gotta give it to them for that.",

We ordered the nachos and wings, both were fabulous!!  The bbq sauce along with the cheese and other toppings on the nachos were a good ratio, no chip left naked!  The wings were crisp and flavorful, and the perfect amount of heat.  We'll absolutely come back and try more items on the menu!",

The restaurant looks super cool, but the food was a fail.   We waited about 15 mins to get a table. While we were waiting you could see a ton of food waiting under warming lights, which didn't give me a good vibe to start with.   We got seated and was kind of rushed to order. The place was packed so I'm sure the waiter didn't do it to be rude. He was really just being worked to death.   On to our food. We ordered their signature burger that looked nothing like the picture. It comes with an onion ring that tasted like it had been cooked hours before. The burger was cold, the fries were old, and the presentation was sloppy. The food reminded me on that awful Hard Rock experience from San Antonio.   Overall, save your time and money and try another spot. It wasn't worth my $38.",

The wings were excellent with just the right spice level but the blue cheese wasabi was a little disappointing. I could barely taste wasabi. I had the chicken tortilla soup and it was good. They have a great draft beer selection and the bartender recommended a whiskey barrel amber that was awesome, you could test the staves. Food is pricey as you expect a name chef Vegas restaurant to be. Would definitely come back and drink at the bar, staff was friendly and attentive.",

During this wait,  I noticed that 3 groups were seated and received their food before we did.  Eric did not check on our table and give us updates.  When we finally got our food,  it seemed like he was rushing us.

We were seated outside on the patio, and greeted promptly. Our server was kind and offered great suggestions to the massive food and drink menu! He made sure we were well taken care of and enjoyed our food.  STAR 2 = Food and booze is outrageously good! We opted to share a large margarita (funky cocktails is their jam) and an appetizer, as we weren't too starving! Their cocktails are offered in a regular 16oz size, or a fishbowl - which we gladly ordered! Our margarita was large in size and had little sour patch kids in them for a twist on a classic!  The menu features Guy's favorites, like the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger, loaded with everything under the sun! Being that the trashcan nachos are their famous staple, we noshed on them -corn tortilla chips, nacho cheese, jalapenos, crema, pico de gallo, house-smoked pulled pork drizzled in chipotle bbq sauce! It was to die for! NOM!  STAR 3 = Mid day and late night happy hour is offered - featuring bites, brews and cocktails, all for a discounted price!  STAR 4 = Located in the Linq Hotel, it's easy to find, navigate the strip and take part in the action!   While pricing here is pretty steep, portions are massive and it's VEGAS BABY! I know we'll be back!",

Yeah, he's compensating for something. Large portions, bland to perfection and super expensive.   So like if anything is a testament to my claim above, try their 'trash can' nachos. And get this:  Literally, he dresses the dish up to resemble that of a hobos kitchenware because you know nothing screams tasteful eats than to be reminded of all that is discarded on the strip... and we're talking hobo cheese ladies and gentlemen ! Don't worry it's pasteurized !  All of this of course I could have potentially overlooked  if my turkey burger pleased my taste buds.  It didn't. It was a mess. The giant patty itself was drenched in greasy oil and obfuscated any discernible taste. It wasn't advertised as fried, yet whoever crafted this down syndrome sandwich literally nuked it with the whole bottle of cannoli oil.  Fries were leftover waffle fries, shoestring fries, potato wedges and I think I found bits and pieces of what looked like to be onion ring skin. What the hell? Now it may be the chef was trying to let the patrons survey the fries, but it felt like he scraped whatever leftovers and threw them together like in the visual narrative example the chef did in 'the big short' to illustrate toxic collateralized debt obligation sub prime packages.",

I didn't eat my food.   However, when they saw we were having issues, they did offer us a refund, hence the three stars. Kind service, food could be better.",

Now after I stopped eating meat and dairy products, of course, we were looking to find a place to eat at late late evening. We asked hostess if there is any options for me to get anything to eat at this place and been told that there is one vegetarian option. We gave it a try. And it was a very good decision. We explained my situation to our waiter and he went on and beyond to accommodate our needs. Every thing was prepared a vegan way, our truffle fries was made vegan with cheese and milk content soused on a side, he also brought me some extra souse on a side.  I still eat fish so it wasn't any problem with my entree , but he made sure there wasn't any butter used. He was also fun to talk to. We had a wonderful time.  Food is beyond tasty, that truffle fries was something. It was completely gone ( usually we kind of skeptical about fries for appetizers and never finish  it) we were thinking about second order of it.   The place it self is little bit loud but come on it is Vegas.  I m definitely coming back in April.  P.s.: I know they didn't cheat, my stomach was doing fine.",

We went again in February and got into town just in time for dinner. I immediately wanted to go here because all i could think of was those trash can nachos.  So we checked in and headed down to Guy's. 10-15 minute wait.. not bad at all. We were seated outside. Also seated outside was a group of already wasted loud and obnoxious AF group of people. So im trying to ignore that hot mess looking over the  menu. Servers came and went to other tables. We waited 10-15 minutes for someone to come. Out in the cold (there was a heater but it was still cold) I was almost to the point of walking out. Finally someone comes. No personality, no apologies, no small talk. Just asking what we wanted and left. We asked about the seasonal shot... apparently they ran out. He didnt reccomend anything in its place. And half way thru our meal we had a different server. Usually they tell us theyre going on break or something but nope. And it was a server who passed us multiple times without saying a word. So yea there wasnt going to be a good tip. Sorry not sorry  Now to the food. Maybe i was buzzed last time and now i wasnt but the nachos were subpar. The cheese tasted like melted kraft singles. We also split a burger i forgot which one tho. It was aight.  Nothing special. I did like that the fries were a hodgepodge of types. There were waffle, steak fries and shoestring.  I love fries so this was a pleasant surprise.   Its sad my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt i'll go back.",

The burger and fries were very greasy but very good! Honestly the fries were so large that this appetizer should be for 4-5 people! Insane portion size!!!! Waiters were very nice and attentive.

After we were seated in took 10 minutes for the waiter to come to ask what would we like to drink.  Since we didn't drink we asked for water with lemon and we also placed our order  (chicken & fish tacos, & fries).  The waiter came in about 10 more minutes but no lemons.  Ten minutes later the waiter showed up with lemons. After approx. 40 minutes later we asked about our order because we observed that 3 different tables that were seated after us had received their food.  Ten minutes later the waiter showed up with cold French fries and cold tacos. The shells had even gotten hard and the wooden serving tray was cold.  We notified the waiter and he said he will get the manager over to our table. After waiting on the manager for 10 more minutes we got up to leave and as we were walking out the manager came and apologized and said he will take care of the bill.  Hell it wasn't a bill because we didn't drink anything but water. I will never visit this place again and GUY, while you are running around eating at other spots, review your own establishment.  I wish I could give you a ZERO!",

It was a Saturday night and we found the place after arriving on the Strip (great location at The Quad) and put our names in. I loved that we could just give them our numbers and chill out in a casino until the table was ready. After we were seated, our waiter introduced himself and the night went from average to TOP NOTCH. His name was Chris Anderson and not only did he know his stuff, but he was incredibly attentive and did everything possible to make our first visit THE BEST. We ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and it blew our minds so much that Chris kept bringing out their truffle aioli later for our entrees. Between all os us, we took down the Mac & Cheese Burger (literally one of the best burgers I've ever had, everything down to the lettuce is flavored to a T), the Steak Asado tacos, the Double Barrel BBQ wings, and the Cheesecake for dessert. We only spent one night in Vegas and all we can remember is how good that meal was. They even put candles in the cheesecake and sang happy birthday. The only way it could have been better is if Guy himself was there, but eating at his restaurant was the next best thing.",

    "text": "I have to say I am not a big fan of Guy.... however, this restaurant may have changed my outlook. The wait was WAY longer than the host originally quoted but I have to say it wasn't because service was slow. People need to get off their phones and stop camping out at the tables, other patrons need to eat....hurry it up! This place is a BEAST! I would happily hire ANY of these servers, runners, and line any day. This place is a well oiled machine, food comes out faster than you cam imagine. The servers actually CARE and you can tell, at times some of them were speed walking at my normal jogging pace. When pur food came out it all looked perfect, my pylled pork was a little chilly and instead of just heating it up pike I asked the chef insisted on firing my entree on the fly. Second time it came out it was perfect!  Thanks Chef, you made the experience even better by getting my plate back to my table in 6 minutes.  I repeat 6 minutes people. I give serious props to the management of this place,  you keep your employees happy, they love their job and you can tell. The food was HUGE and DELICIOUS!  Prices were child's play for the amount of food you get. I will come back here time and time again even if it is just to see the force that this place moves. Absolutely amazing,  my mind is blown! WONDERFUL TWO THUMBS WAY UP! Thank you for pleasantly surprising me and for schooling all other famous eateries in the area on how to run a kitchen. Long story short....This place is in beast mode 24/7.",

    "text": "Had a quick bite to eat here last night and the food was good but it wasn't fantastic.  The service however was not good at all.  Our server was Shelby and she was not attentive in any way.  She did not ask if we have any questions about the menu nor did she offer to tell us her recommendations. We ordered 2 items from the menu and 2 beers.  I had the summer ale and the hubs had a lager.  She brought the beers out and mistakenly gave me my husband's.  I didn't know and I took a couple of sips before my husband realized it.  We ordered the whiskey spicy wings and the drunkun fish tacos, both were good but the wings were not spicy. The server brought the food out, laid them on the table and disappeared.  It would be nice of her to offer a couple of plates...  we had to ask for it when she reappeared which was a while later. Towards the end of the meal, she did ask us once how the food was but as soon as she asked the question, she looked away to check on the next table, never looking back at us for our response.  Finally what I found to be the most rude is that she never thanked us for coming.  She handed me the bill without saying anything!!!  And the same thing when she handed me back my credit card and the slip.  I will come back to eat here but definitely hope another server would be taking care of me.",

After 45 minutes I asked what happened and they immediately seated me at the outside bar. I ordered the cheesebuger and asket for it medium. They said they only cook them medium or medium well So I said definelty more on the medium side. This came with there assorted fries. The $19.00 burger arrived 30 minutes, after my first biter I realize it is overcooked to beyond well and cold! Dryed out and tasteless! The fries were also luke warm. I was very hungry from traveling all day and forced myself to eat half of this disgusting thing. My waitress was nice, however never asked how everything was? When she did come to clean up I told her how unhappy I was withe meal. Ans asked for the ck and said I was ready to leave. Five minutes later a so clled manger approaches me and says\"You wanted me\" I said excuse me and let him know how unhappy I was with the food. he had a bad attitude, but did ask if I wanted a new one and said no. Had enough of this 2 hour fiasco. I eat out very frequently and must say :this was on of the worst burgers I have ever eaten at any cost. Stay away, for $19.00 get some real edible food. NOT HERE!",

    "text": "I finally gave in and walked down to the Linq to see if Guy's burger kitchen and Bar wasn't too busy for my wife and myself to give it try. Lets face it for those who only visit here occasionally you have to pay the prices reflecting the high rent of being on the strip. The eateries don't have to worry about repeat business because new bodies show up everyday and service such as was at  Michael's (Barbary Coast) Is long in the past. Ok got there around 1:30 waited for about 25 min before we were seated. My wife got the Asian chicken wraps (15) and I ordered the original ringer burger (18) yes 18.00 for a burger. Ordered the burger medium. It arrived overcooked and dry (not even a hint of pink). I cut it in half and we shared the wraps also. They were just meh. Since we live on the strip it's hard to pay the going prices for mediocre food. We see no need for a return visit. We don't eat much fast food fare but in our consensus the all natural burger at Carl's Jr. will stand up to any in the valley. CKE has good angus beef. Haven't tried the Gordon Ramsey burger but honestly what can be done to a burger to make it cost over 10 bucks. Seems like the real bargain is a little further down. One Dollar Michelob at the Casino Royal.",

    "text": "Do NOT order the wings. For $14 you get scrap parts of the wings, which they call \"lollipops\" and their way of trying to convince you that they make it easy for you to eat...YA, because there is no more meat for you to eat to even get messy. They basically strip off all the meat and leave you with the bone and the driest parts. There are no drums(middle pieces). Literally there is no meat. I had ordered the General So wings. Anyways I would assume the flavor will be amazing but it was terrible. It was too salty and tasted like sweet and sour sauce out of a packet from Panda Express. What does it take to be a good chef? Just making the food look pretty rather than taste good or even filling? I was basically served chicken bones cleaned up and presented to me on a plate with some sauce on the side. I am so offended that they could get away with serving this garbage and charging for it. What do they do with the actual meat? I don't know if I would be more upset if they threw it away or used it on another dish, which means they get paid twice for it.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Guy Fieri, he's from Vegas and I love his Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I was excited to try his new restaurant.  The place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  Went on a nice Sunday for lunch.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  We ordered our drinks and it came.  Flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  I don't know where our server disappeared to.  After that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  Presentation was nice!  I ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- I can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which I recommend on the side.  My son ordered the fish tacos.  He said it was plain and not much flavor.  My other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  It was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  The truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  The server forgot my daughter's water.  She finally got it when our food was brought out.  Service was 1 out of 10.  We ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  When our server came to bring our check and I told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  I don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  Apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  Which I won't.  Did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  Not!  The lunch experience left a bad taste.  We live in Vegas and expect much more from a Strip restaurant especially from Guy Fieri.",

    "text": "Love watching his shows and figured he picked up a lot of great ideas to use at his new restaurant. First the line to get in - 35 minute wait. The problem was that the patio was 1/2 empty and the inside was 2/3's full at best. I asked if we can sit on the patio since it was 1/2 empty but was told we had to wait. I understand you cannot overload a given server area, but I do not think that was the case. I think it was to keep a line so it looked like it was always busy. Our server was great - she was helpful and always there when needed. The problem was the food. Presentation looked good on everything coming out of the kitchen, but the burgers were not worth what they charge and nothing to rave about. The signature app was pepperoni wrapped pretzels - the pepperoni was the lowest quality you find on frozen pizzas. I guess my expectations were too high on the quality of the food he would serve.",

They showed us to our seats out on the patio. We sat there for 15 minutes. We didn't get one person to ask us for drinks or anything. Two other tables sat and were given service the whole time we were waiting to just be seen.During that 15 minutes servers and busboys passee our table multiple times . no one ever asked if we needed help. Finally, I took the menus to the server station, and told them that we are leaving because we had been sitting there for 15 minutes and we hadn't been helped yet. I then asked to see a manager at the front desk. The manager came out and apologized and said that The server assigned to that area had gone to the bathroom and there was a miscommunication, and didn't realize there was anyone at the table. That is really, really, pathetic. For a place to have guy Fieri's name on it, that was the most piss poor run restaurant that I've ever seen.",

The place was pretty packed but we managed to get a seat within 10 min of getting there  Our server was really nice, but extremely slow. We got our drinks after 20 minutes of ordering and our food - a salad and a burger - after a little over an hour. The only thing that came rather quick was the check of course   Food: I got the Greek salad and boyfriend got the mac n cheese burger with fries. The salad must have been the worst Greek salad I've ever had. The dressing was really heavy and none of the vegetables were actually cut up. I had to individually cut each vegetable for it to be bite size which I though was a rather peculiar presentation. The mac n cheese burger was well done instead of medium rare like my boyfriend asked, but the fries had a delicious garlic aioli sauce that made me give this place 2 stars instead of 1.   Drinks: we both good bloody marys, which had a cool presentation but the Bloody Mary mix was store bought or just terribly mixed.   All in all the place is very touristy, hence the really high prices for the sub par food and service, but they still get a lot of people because of their location. We are definitely never going back next time we are in Vegas. There are plenty of restaurants out there with quality food for the same or lower price.",

    "text": "Looking for a place to take my teen daughter before her match and found Guy Fieri's in the Linq Hotel.  There was a wait for outside dining at 11:30am but we got a nice seat inside where she could look out at the strip and I could watch sports on TV.  A big fan of TV cooking she told me I had to get the Motley Que pulled pork sandwich.  Please remember when looking at the menu that they call chips the British way (they really are fries) which confused me at first since he lives in Northern California.  Not wanting to load up too much, had a Greek Salad and water.  The drinks looked amazing, but being the responsible parent I drank an Arnold Palmer.  Our server, Nichole, was very attentive and got our order right away and refilled my drink 3 times before we left. Sounds trivial, but many times I've had Arnold Palmer refills be just iced tea or lemonade.  The sandwich was amazing and I have to say we were quite surprised at the generous and tasty Greek Salad.  The pulled pork was both crispy and tender and the donkey sauce was nice and sweet.  Prices were quite reasonable.  We also caught a glimpse of the Trash Can Nachos.  They were huge!  That is definitely an appetizer for 5-6 people.  The two people who ordered it barely ate a third and encouraged others to eat it!",

He's also good at wearing sweatbands and loud Affliction type t-shirts, driving classic cars and having his sunglasses hang on his ears and dangle off the back of his neck like a total dick. Excellent. What he's not good at is having his own restaurant(s).   Now to be fair, I haven't been to El Burro Borracho or Johnny Garlic's Pasta Grill or GUY'S! (sic) Sammich (sic) Joint. Nor have I tried the (late) Flavortown in Times Square.  But I don't NEED to because this m**therf****r sold me the most disgusting plate of food I've ever been served in my adult life. Ladies and gentlemen, the \"Guy-talian Fondue Dippers\". Imagine a congealing, skin-topped bowl of cold, white Velveeta crowned with lumps of sausage and (somehow) crunchy Slim Jims to dip into it. It was sick. It was heartburn in a bite. It was the chagrin of ordering this silly app for the story and sharing it with friends and then feeling absolutely horrified I talked them into it and offering to pay for the whole thing. THAT BAD. The trash can nachos are not very good either. But those are great for an Instagram story so I'll leave it up to you.   The service was fine but unless you're literally going ironically for the (Instagram) story-- STAY AWAY.",

You're going to be paying Vegas Strip prices here but it's beyond worth it. We ordered the trash can nahos which was $20 but a TON of food! Honestly, they were the best nachos I've ever had. The BBQ sauce that is on the brisket has a great sweet flavor which goes perfectly with the heat of the pepers.   The flavortown burger that I got had a ton of delicious pastronami on it and the size of the burger itself was far more than I could eat in one sitting (after I shoved my face with nachos.)  Everyone else within my party raved about the food as well. If you're going to spend $20 on a burger, this is the place you want to do it!",

I was too full to make it to the burger but I guess I will be back. Service was attentive and friendly. I really liked the laid-back casual vibe here.",

Found the meat to be very dry and over cooked. (I didn't eat the bun which didn't help for covering the dry meat in sauces). If you want a great burger, go to any Gordon Ramsay restaurant where they ask how you would like your meat cooked instead of just automatically giving you over-done. Also, service was very slow and restaurant was not busy. Would not go back.",

We ordered the following:   The Original Ringer Burger $18   Bacon Mac N Cheese Burger $20  The burgers were good but the flavors did not pop. I just felt it was very heavy and rich tasting. I thought the quad fries tasted better the actual burger. The wood plank presentation is ok but I would rather have a large plate so that none of your food falls off and on your table. Overall, I would rate this place ok. I can't say though it beat Bobby Flay, Gordon Ramsay, or even Bachi Burger. And those burgers were cheaper than Guy's....",

    "text": "I was honestly a little skeptical on taking another trip to flavortown. My first visit was at Tex Wasabi in Cali and was bummed about the trip. We just so happened to be famished from all of the running around that the NASCAR fan week had us do so needless to say that we were ready to head in for a refuel (silly pun).   For starters we ordered the Triple T fries They weren't kidding around with the description. This dish was LOADED with truffle essence! To my surprise the Gouda cheese (which I am not a fan of; sorry it an Asian thing) that topped the fries did not overpower the dish but gave it a nice gooey accent. Good Job Guy!  For the main event I ordered the \"Mayor of Flavortown\"  A HUGE patty (overkill on the meat to bun ratio) topped with pastrami and all of the fixins on a pretzel bun! Think of it as Sammy's Pastrami burger's 6' tall dressed dressed up Sasquatch of a cousin.   I cheated and got a side of Bourbon BBQ sauce to slather on this monster. The Bourbon burn really comes through giving it a nice burn to accompany the tang. It was a prefect add-on for the burger. Sorry Guy, The burger was good the way your created it BUT BBQ Sauce makes everything better..  The burger was well put together, most importantly; it could be eaten like a burger. Too often when you get giant burgers, they don't hold up well and you end up having to fork and knife it. To me this kills the \"burger\" experience so this is why I bring it up...     The burger was also served with a \"small\" side of the quad fries; aptly named for the location and the 4 kinds of fries...This was overkill as we had more than half of our 3T fries..   Don't balk at the $18/17 price tag as you get more than your money's worth with this monstrosity of a sandwich.   Service was decent; I value that our server gave us his honest opinions on the food and made real suggestions.   The one knock if any that I will give this place is that all of the food was a bit on the salty side. No biggie for us BUT it is noticeable. We came for flavor town not the salt mine.   Anyhow Guy's is near the top of my list of INSANE CHEAT MEALS  Tips:  Don't forget to bring your Total Rewards players card; it will save you a dollar on everything you order.    Ask for extra BBQ sauce! You can never have enough sauce!",

    "text": "We have a new winner for the worst dining experience of our lives.  We arrived on a Friday night (August 26) at 7:30 p.m. - yes there was a 50-60 minute wait, which was of course expected and to no fault of the restaurant!   My wife and I were waiting in their small designated area for about 45 minutes when I went to the washroom. I come back to see my wife extremely shaken-up and looking on the verge of tears. Turns out, the manager (tall, dark hair, big guy) had literally screamed at her, in front of a large crowd, claiming she was harassing staff and telling her just how horrible of a person she is. Loudly proclaiming just how much he doesn't tolerate \"bulls!t\" and how \"sick people like you make me.\" After almost a minute of abuse and very confused, she asks what she did to deserve this public humiliation, he finally realizes she was NOT with the intoxicated group in question and he had the wrong person. He says a casual \"oh, it wasn't you, my bad\" and walks off. Excuse me?   About to leave the restaurant after I find this out, the hostess comes by and profusely apologizes, and says the manager had to go do something, but will be coming over to our table to apologize properly in a few minutes and asks that we please stay. My wife and I decide to stay (not sure why, now that I think about it). The abusive manager never comes back.   Our meal came, which was absolutely horrible. Honestly, even if this had not happened, this food was not edible. My wife had a laughable salad called \"Italian Deli\" that came out with pickles (not pickled Italian veggies... pickles), wrapped in a cold piece of prosciutto. I had the \"Mayor of Flavortown burger\" - overcooked, dry patty that was served with fries that look like they came out of a frozen bag from Walmart. Horrible.  It's a shame, we were actually huge Guy Fieri fans before this - yes it's ridiculous to think that it's \"his or his brand's fault\" that this despicable human being of a manager did what he did, and the food came out inedible, but we're definitely done with anything \"Guy\".   If ever this manager reads his Yelp reviews: you should be ashamed of yourself.",

The downside of this place, is waiting for a table. About a 45 minute wait. We were seated in the patio area, it was very loud from the next door music. Was hard to talk to each other at our table.",

My only issue, tiny tiny issue, was that the '68 cajun sandwich is served on this shallow roll so there is no good way to contain all the smoky meaty goodness inside. You end up eating it pretty much like a sandwich without a top. It was so good though that I really didn't care. Besides, more bread may have just interfered with the flavor and just soaks up the tasty beer anyway. This is a two pint sammich!  They were busy but we sat at bar and the bartender was good at checking in on us without being bothersome.   We will absolutely be back.",

We were checked on multiple times and food came very quickly (although, the wait was at least an hour, but we did come on a Friday night the day before Valentine's Day)! Don't be fooled by the prices, you really get what you pay for! I'm pretty sure you can share everything considering how monstrous the portions are.  Bacon Mac 'n' Cheese Burger: 4/5. The food was good, but nothing to be overly excited about. It was also a lukewarm when it came out. I would have loved to be served warm food. I shared with my boyfriend, and we were both pretty full afterwards!  Fireball whiskey wings: 5/5. My FAVORITE. Flavors were on par, and the dressing was absolutely amazing. I wish I could have more!  Boulder ice cream: 5/5 giant ice cream scoop wrapped in cereal, served with strawberries, pineapples, bananas and peanut butter, whipped cream, maple syrup, and chocolate syrup. All 4 of us shared it and were satisfied! Oh gosh, I loved it! It's too bad I need to burn it all off next week in the gym, but it was worth it!  Overall, my only complaints were the lukewarm food and long wait times. Other than that, everything was pretty great here. Enough to take me back? If I'm ever in the area, yes. Is it a must? Eh.",

The buffalo wasabi wings was an interesting mix. If you like wings, I would def recommend it. The mac n cheese burger was pretty good. Again, and interesting mix of flavors. The pulled pork burger is a def recommend! Really good flavor. We liked how the fries come in a variety, so you don't have to choose between curly, shoe string, or crinkle fries.",

I had the carne asada tacos and they blew out any tacos if ever had at a restaurant. Tortillas were especially good. I tried the BBQ chicken wings, and the BBQ sauce is extreme unique but equally delicious.   Would recommend for anyone looking for dinner at the Linq, nice job Fieri",

We are huge Guy Fieri and DDD fans so we decided we had to have dinner here.  Great location in the Promenade close to the strip hotel entrance (opposite of the High Roller).  It was not terribly busy (half of the outdoor tables were empty at the time) but they seemed short staffed when we arrived.  You check in with the hostess and they take your cellphone number so they can text you when your table is ready (clever marketing tactic so now they have your real cellphone number).  It took about 30 minutes before we were finally seated on the patio with plenty of room for our service dog.  Not too long after we were seated the patio filled up with customers.  We placed our order but the wait time for our food was longer than expected.  It was worth the wait!  The food was plated beautifully and tasted fantastic.  Our entrees came with a side of Quad fries (waffle, side-winder, julienne, and crinkle) which were just as delicious.  We will definitely be back!  We ordered: .The Original Ringer Burger / well done / Side of chili / Diet Coke - The entree was perfectly cooked and delicious!  Chili was flavorful. .Crab Cake Sandwich Special / Club soda and lime - Delicious and ginormous crab cake serving larger than the roll itself.  I was able to eat 1/2 of the sandwich as is and just the other 1/2 of the crab cake (no roll). .Side of raw carrots for our dog  PROS: Location, service, food CONS: A little on the pricey side RECOMMENDATIONS: Keep doing what you're doing :)",

    "text": "This place has something for everyone. We went here twice during our Vegas stay and I was pretty pleased with both meals. Once was for a late night snack, the other lunch.   For the late night snack, we got the Sashimi Won-Ton Tacos. These were delicious and possibly one of the highlights of the menu! The wrappers were in the shape of taco shells and were perfect! Super light and crispy. The filling was ahi tuna with a mango salsa- delicious! We ordered the Fried Ice Cream dessert and I was pretty disappointed with the fried part- it was actually pretty soggy and instead of being crispy- it actually was more chewy- not what I had hoped for. It did come with a considerable amount of sides to top with it to make it your own- but I wouldn't order that one again.   The second meal we had here I tried the carne asada tacos. You get 4 small tacos to an order, which is a good portion size. They were great and came with two salsa options. There was a good portion of steak in each of the tacos and a yummy cabbage slaw on top.  The Quad hotel gave us a free coupon for Vegas fries- so we tried those too--- think steak type fries meets buffalo wings. The bleu cheese dressing is pretty over whelming- I went for ranch instead.   Overall, the service is pretty good, the staff is welcoming and generally attentive. You even have the opportunity to do a digital survey (There's an I-touch in the bill folio) at the end of your meal to give feedback. The portion sizes can be pretty huge- make sure you go in hungry if you're ordering entrees!",

    "text": "Three stars says \"A-OK\", but more like ok.  We put our name on wait list this past Sunday night around 9pm and were told it was a 30-40 min wait.  While waiting, I scoped the restaurant and noticed more than a handful of empty tables in the main dining area and the patio with plenty of available seating along the railing in the patio.  I went back to the hostess after some time and asked why the long wait when so many tables are open.  Her response, \"empty tables need to be cleaned\".  I looked back and didn't see them being cleaned.  There were two hostess working the entrance and would have loved to see that if tables needed to be cleaned and if other staff members weren't doing it or weren't available....then it would have been nice to see one of the hostesses take the initiative to take care of it themselves simply to get all these people in who were waiting.  I didn't understand why we waited so long when there were so many tables open!  We were seated in the patio and couldn't help notice all the noise.  I understand it's Vegas, but it was a bit much.  There was music coming from the entrance of the Linq, then there was the tv's in the patio with basketball games, then there was the live music from across the way from whatever restaurant/bar was there.  It was noise overload.  Other than ALL that, the food was good.  My husband and I both had the Original Ringer Burger and liked it.  Loved the presentation.  Menu items are pricey, but gotta expect that from anywhere on the strip, which is too bad!  Now I can say \"been there, done that...NEXT!\".",

We tried the Mexican Churros. I was honestly pretty disappointed. I was really hoping for the best Churros ever. Instead I got long pieces of over fried dough that was too crunchy and just fell apart. Next time I'll try something different. Over all, I love Guy Fieri and loved his restaurant. Oh....almost forgot! YOU MUST TRY THE FRIES. I they're the Vegas fries. Not sure but they have a white cream on the side and I think they are covered in parmesan and parsley. Absolutely delicious!",

Overall, the place is what you would expect from a restaurant with Guy Fieri's name on it, kind of trendy but also made to look divey...you know what I mean.   The breakfast menu is actually pretty decent as there were several delicious options to choose from. I went with the Chilaquiles and they were pretty good. Quite large for chilaquiles, they were almost like pieces of ravioli and the bits of steak had a wood-fired aftertaste with them, so extra points there.   The prices are about what you would expect for The Strip, about 15 bucks for the entrees and most drinks were running around 12. The service was a bit spotty, but a good place to stop for breakfast.",

The first time I was excited because I like watching Guy on DDD and I know he KNOWS what people love but, I could not have been more disappointed!  The food is totally overpriced and the selection not that great.  We got an appetizer of pretzel sticks wrapped in pepperoni with a cheese dip - this was a joke, it was pretzel rods - the kind you buy in a bag at the store.  This was something like $15.00.  The rest of the food that was ordered SUCKED.  Everyone ordered different things so we could all try everything and NOTHING was good.  The next time I went was with a different group of friends that were in town and wanted to try it so...i went.  I  was hoping for a better experience, but once again, TOTALLY disappointed.   For all of the food this Guy has eaten, this is a huge disappointment.  Overpriced and overhyped.  I've had better food from a hot dog stand outside of a Home Depot!",

Decided to come back this time and found the menu was a little different.  Pepperoni sticks with cheese fondue dip, not an improvement.  They were OK though.  Biggest disappointment, when second bartender, since the first one stopped serving us, went to give us our bill, knocked over a 3/4 full beer on my wife's lap.  It became very apparent there was no policy or procedure for when this happens.   She asked us what we wanted.  Seriously???!!!  Her resolution was she at least owed my wife a beer, so \"gave\" her one that basically replaced what we all ready paid for and ducked to the other side of the bar.  It is bad enough that a pint of beer is $8, but to then get a $50 beer bath and have to go back to the Luxor to change (and get through the hockey fans in the process), yeah not going back.",

Downstairs, Guy Fieri's restaurant was an obvious second choice, especially with the wait being less than 30-minutes.  Saw their HUGE Bloody Mary's on the Food Network Channel and decided to try the smaller version.  This drink was nice and spicy and came with jalapenos, spicy sausage, candied marble bacon and a celery stalk.  You can taste the Vodka, and since my drink came out late, it was FREE.  Ordered the Mayor of Flavortown burger.  The burger patty was cooked nice and was blanketed with seasoned pastrami, which I thought was overcooked.  Swiss cheese, coleslaw, dill pickles, onion straws, and Dijon mustard accompanied all of this sitting on top of a pretzel bun.  The bun was a little on the hard side, so I ate it \"protein style\" (w/o the bun).  The fries that accompanied the burger were good.  All in all, the food was okay.  It didn't suck, but didn't match up to BurGR.  This restaurant is located in the LINQ Hotel.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "Food:  -the motley q burger was awesome. If you love BBQ, it's the best burger on the menu to fulfill your tastebuds.  -The bacon Mac & cheese burger was good too. I think it can totally lose the shredded lettuce. It's just way too much for that kind of savory burger.  -The fries that come with the burgers and sandwiches were bomb. I love that they were mixed and matched with waffle & shoestring and whatnot.  -Caesar salad was basic, fresh and delightful. I didn't care too much for the big crouton that was holding everything up. Too stale.   Service:  Elizabeth was nice, knew the menu but there were a couple of times when my guest request was brushed aside and it lagged too much. We asked for salt and pepper with our Caesar and we didn't get it till we were 3/4 of the way done with our Caesar... We're not fast eaters.  Greeters were not upbeat and did not even seem like they wanted to be there.   Overall the whole reason why I'm giving this a 3 star rating is because of the cleanliness. My glasses were super dirty. I talked to a manager and said what was wrong, he wasn't defensive but just said that there's something wrong with the water and chemicals.. Sure. I agree with you but a simple polishing of glasses so I don't think it's dirty would be SO MUCH better for my perception. Polishing doesn't take a long time especially since it's just the rim. Also, the table and booth were dirty and wet upon seating. Seriously? Doesn't take much to clean it up.   Food was alright, nothing knocked my socks off, service was mediocre, cleanliness was what made it a meh experience.",

After being seated promptly the waitress took our drink and meal order.  The waters arrived quickly, the beers took a bit. The pastrami burger was terrific, but the Greek salad had a lot to be desired. What was first delivered was the wrong salad and it appears the correct one was just thrown together. There was no dressing and only two small chunks of feta with two giant wedges of tomatoes and a quarter-head of romaine. Nothing was cut into bite sized pieces. I could have done this at home. It was a disappointment as when we complained to the wait staff we only received a lame apology with nothing comp'd. I was not impressed with the caliber I expected, plus the cost for 2 beers, a burger and a salad was a steep $46.00.",

After that our server was gone, no checking on us, no drink refills, nothing! The food. Ceasar salad was bland and watery, croutons were good. Table split the rib plate. Daughter wouldn't eat the mac and cheese, it was thick and pasty. I was not a fan. Cornbread was DRY and had melted cheese on top? Ew. My portion of the ribs were good, the other two pieces were drrrryyyyyyy, the bark making it hard to chew and swallow. Bbq sauce is spicy and good. I wouldn't come back. Small menu, no kids menu and high prices for flashy food. Sorry guy, I still love you, just not your vegas kitchen.",

I have a funny feeling that the cooks are chain smokers as all of the food is way over salted. We also ordered the street tacos that taste fine but was cold.

I wanted each bit to be grand but it wasnt just that. 20$ burger needs to be a P.O.W an not a B.O.O! Fries came out cold :-(  The Cheesecake with lays isn't such a grand idea due to the lays going limp an soggy the chocolate on it was so dark an rich it had a salt flavor.  So the best thing I had there was the lemonade an watching drunk people an also seeming people not finish there food. You want all plates to be cleaned off.  May try again in the future.",

Both boys orders a full rack of ribs and I got the BBQ plate.  The ribs had been boiled so long you couldn't tell the meat from the bone.  Horribly overcooked.  No consistency in the meat. Also the hostess was rude, didn't greet us nor other patrons, short-talked us and wouldn't make eye contact.  Luckily our server saved the service experience. Very disappointing dinner at Guy's in Vegas.",

    "text": "My gf and I came here expecting the quality of food that Guy Fieri expects.   Personally, I am not a fan of well-done steak sandwiches. The steak was probably cooked well, but I can tell it was sitting under a salamander-like heater because the side of the steak was red while the inside of the steak was well-done. Additionally, the fries weren't fresh (I assumed the fries were under a salamander too). It's sad because we came during high traffic hours when food is supposedly fresh. I don't like giving 1-stars but the food quality to price ratio was horrible.   When I told the waiter that my steak was well-done, he told me it was medium because the side of the steak was slightly red. Then, I opened up the entire sandwich and showed him all 5 well-done slices with one slice having slight red meat on the side. I then told him, the meat was sliced and kept warm until another order came in, which happened to turn the meat well-done.   When you guys pick a restaurant on the Vegas strip, don't judge a book by its cover (unless you are a huge Guy Fieri fan).",

    "text": "Disappointed - new menu, smaller portions.   We've dined here and loved it ever since Guy's opened.  The turkey sandwich (a relatively healthier option with thick slices of white turkey) was fantastic - just had one in March - its now off the menu!  The Ceasar salad was a work of art - tall, large plate of premium lettuce with a huge crouton - awe inspiring and delicious - is now a shadow of its former self.  This place was on the Vegas 'must visit' list.  I get the reviews saying it's overpriced, but I always felt the quality and quantity were worth it.  Unfortunately, they just changed the menu.....and well, I don't I'm not sure I'll be coming back.  No turkey sandwich so I got the burger - it was not worth the money - it was small and  unimpressive in look and flavor.   The fry container wasn't topped off, and there was not so much as a pickle on the side.   And the Ceasar?  Smaller, dark bitter lettuce and no huge crouton.  NOT worth the price. It looked more like a side salad.  We didn't finish either or bother to take home what was left.    To top it off,  the usually good ambiance (2 stars for that) was disturbed by someone that actually brought their own mini boom box and played it in restaurant despite the overhead music.  Talk about annoying.  Management should have shut that down.",

The barrel things weren't anything too special and don't really get how the onion rings kinda pairs w/ the wings. Although the wings didn't stand out, the Triple-T fries were one of my favorite truffles fries and they give you a good amount. The server was great and friendly. Although we only ordered snacks to eat in the restaurant, he was still really nice towards us.   I would totally come back for their Triple-T fries and tried other things as well. The triple t fries did came w/ a great amount but I still think it's a bit expensive($13). The wings were the real expensive item to get considering it was 16 dollars for 6 wings + 2 celery. Given the 3 stars, I would still totally come back to get their delicious Triple-T fries.",

Word to the wise-make sure your food is hot and has not been sitting before you let the waiter go. I had the mac and cheese burger and it was sooo not worth it. The mac part was dried out and the burger was overdone. I order my burgers med rare so I think it sat under a heat lamp for too long. It was like a whopper at closing time dry..... We had lots and maybe all of the appetizers and there was nothing remarkable that stood out. Someone ordered the cheesecake desert they had and that was wayyyyyy over the top. It was like most of a cheesecake and topped with so much other stuff it looked mechanical. This place is True Vegas- over the top and showy with nothing behind it-the place has sub par food and is as loud as a drag strip.",

Unfortunately, had higher expectations than this (especially on a weekend) ...how are you out of steak and brisket?!",

My peeves about our experience:  1) Prices on the menu are not what you pay unless you are some type of loyalty member.  Not that big of a deal but this is something our server should have explained.  (Non member prices push your bill about 25% higher in our experience)  2) No restroom.  Need to use casino restroom. (I assume employees can wash their hands onsite :) )  3) Service:  they seem to be trying hard, us, and some other tables had to go to the bar to get a second drink. (Wasn't terribly busy)  I had the Mac n Cheese burger, was a good choice.  Enjoy!",

Burger was overloaded with other things except a decent burger patty. Naturally one would assume the key ingredient should be... ta-da! the burger! But it was too thin and not prominent amongst all the other fillings.  Personally I like a decent burger and bun first and foremost and then some adventurous toppings if you so choose.  If you want a good burger there's other places to go instead.  Tried Holsteins Shakes and Buns. Much better on the burger front. KGB looked good. Yet to try.",

The tilapia mixed perfectly with everything and it was just an amazing dish. My man ordered the Fireball Whiskey Wings and said that they were a great balance of spice when you use the blue-sabi sauce. For drinks the winner was the Lemon Drop.... Not! It was delicious, not too strong and the taste was on point although it did pack a kick. I would recommend dining here to anyone hitting the strip, it was a great experience",

This time I'm rating only rating it a 2 star because of the service and cold food. We were seated very quickly because it was around 10 PM and they just switched over to their late-night menu, which is smaller, the restaurant was starting to die down. We sat outside on the patio. It took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by to take our drink order by that time we already knew what we wanted so we ordered our food as well. I got the mac and cheese bacon burger. The waitress came and checked on us once before our food came out. The lady bringing the drinks came by and slammed the waters down on the table which surprised me because of how hard she did it. our food finally came out but it was brought by a different person. when I bit into my burger it was cold so our food must've been sitting in the kitchen for a while. The food is usually hot and fresh tasting. It's really good just wish the service is consistent. after I was done eating my food the drink lady came by again and asked if our now empty drinks needed a refill. We said yes and we finally had something more to drink. I probably would of ordered more $14 cocktails if given the chance. They did have a manager floating the floor but he was more interested in hanging out at hostess station then assuring people are receiving 5 star good service. I like the uniforms they wear it's an all Jean theme with vests but our waitress had her boobs hanging out a little too much for good taste. I'm a guy and don't mind a little rack candy but it was pretty much a sundae coming out. Keep up the good work Guy! I still will come back but only during peak hours when service is on point.",

We've had many meals here over the last couple of years and they've all been very satisfying.",

She was right on with estimate , got seated at and ordered by 5 and we literally didn't get our food until 5:55, at this point I seen 3 people tell my waiter something about this, seemed like he didn't know how to handle the situation so he just would ignore you. I finally stopped him and told him just cancel my order but right as I said that he brought our food out with the most burnt French fries I have ever eaten. I got the pastrami burger which I cant complain about it was really good. We also waited 30 minutes for our waiter to give us our check, almost felt like it was on purpose, he walked by us around 15 times in the 30 minutes and I know he seen us frustrated but kept on going avoiding us. Server was Raymond, I even told him to check when we ordered and he never came back until I stopped him. We love watching guy fieri on tv and that is why we wanted to try it out. We will never be going back there again, we finally got out of there by 6:30.",

    "text": "My wife and I intended to go to a different restaurant at the same hotel, but the wait was too long. We checked out the menu and thought we'd give it a shot.  I suspect this place catches a lot of overflow, although it was not very busy when we went.   Immediately upon entering you're greeted by a thirty foot Guy Fieri picture whose eyes tend to follow you, no matter where you go. Occasionally throughout the meal I made awkward eye contact with Guy. I felt judged. Seriously, it was a little weird.  Service: three different servers asked us if we wanted drinks, which is better than no servers asking if you want drinks, but a little bothersome. Water glasses remained full and $12 mimosa and Bloody Mary were ok. Service was attentive overall, but didn't take our app plate when the entrees came, making it a bit crowded at the table.   Food: for an appetizer we had the fondue dippers. The cheese sauce was decent, but the breadsticks were more difficult to manage than food should be. Long, dry breadsticks wrapped in pepperoni and dusted with Parmesan cheese. I don't know if they put them in the oven or what, but they were lukewarm and broke easily. Kind of messy.   My wife had a Caesar salad and the dressing was not good, way too much cheese, and bland overall. It came with something called the \"mega crouton\" which looked like a bread boomerang.  No joke. She could barely eat any of it. $17 Caesar salad failure.    I had the mayor of flavor town burger, or something like that. It had pastrami on the burger with Asian slaw in a pretzel bun. Came with a fry medley. This is not the kind of burger you can pick up and eat, which was what I was hoping for. If you're dressed nice and away from your hotel, handle with extreme caution. I ended up dismantling it with a fork and knife, but it still wasn't anything special. The fries were good.   We noticed some other diners having trouble with sandwiches, and I felt a little guilty when I didn't warn the table next to us when they placed their order for burgers.  We found humor in some of the decor and staff uniforms, and had a pretty good time despite the food, but your $95 with tip would be better spent elsewhere. I debated paying with cash so there would be no record we ever went there.",

There was already bitterness because of customer service and before I left I told hostess all we needed a smile from server that's all. I am going back to Vegas in aug but never going back there",

The service was very slow, waited almost 10 min before we even got some ice water. Then wen ordered spinach and artichoke stuff mushrooms. I was desperately looking for salt for an expensive appetizer it was a 4/10 taste. We all ordered different burgers and no one gave there burger over a 5/10 they were all cajun style even the mac and cheese one, not juicy and the fries however creative were not good. Our waiter was very overwhelmed the table next to us was about to leave, they waited over an hr for there food and they ordered before  us, and when we were walking out the people in front of us said, and I quote \" What a waste of money\"  the same way we felt $140 later when it could of just been a $30 mcdonalds night with the same quality of food. My advice, spend your money somewhere else,  sorry.",

Don't know what kinda magic they put into that burger patty but it had so much flavor & it was juicy!

It was pretty empty when we entered which should've given us a clear indication of how much the food sucked... We got the bacon Mac and cheese burger and the waffle chili cheese fries. I mean, how could you even go wrong with a combination like that? Well, you can at Guy's. The burger was so over cooked it was black, they basically just slapped some Kraft cheese on top of pasta and microwaved some bacon and put that monstrosity together... and my waffle fries!! My poor dried hard crispy fries. They sat in the fryer way too long. They basically just added a bunch of chili and cheese to cover up what they'd done, but you can't fool me! Honestly, Carl's Jr crisscut fries are better. And the cocktail, the $14 cocktail that was only filled just a little more than half way of my glass...   I shake my head in disappointment and will never be back. Pretty sure they'll be out of business soon.",

Probably spiciest thing I've ever eaten lol. I ordered the bacon Mac and cheese burger and it was awesome, just so big and messy! My sister ordered the ribs and really liked them. Cocktails were good too. It was expensive but what isn't in Vegas? I'd definitely recommend this place and go back. We didn't have to wait for a table either which was nice.",

Aside from the chicken/turkey/veggie burgers I make from scratch at home, this was the first real (beef) burger I've had in about 3,650 days...  I figured, we're in Adult Disney World and anything goes, so I went for it.  All I can say was, DAMN!  My burger was bigger than my (6'5\", 300Lb.) fiance's.  I took 3 bites and was totally stuffed.  Bet your ass I finished it later on that night though!  Ice cold and still delicious.   Everything was fantastic.  Down to the fries and the (real) pretzel bun on my pastrami burger.   It will probably be another 10years until my next burger, but I'll be sure to come back here for it!",

VERY RARE steak and egg whites only.  Nope.  These fools gave me a well done steak and scrambled the eggs.  They didn't charge me for only asking for egg whites so it's whatever.  I purposely waited until the check came before I ate my eggs so that in the event they did charge me extra, I can prove they did not give me what I had asked for.  I couldn't ask server Kayla because she disappeared off the face if the earth after she took our orders.  The service was atrocious, at least from our server Kayla.  All she did was take our order.  Someone else brought out the food.  She never came back to ask how everything was.  She never came back to refill anything.    If fact, she didn't do jack sht.  The next time we saw her was when she came back to drop off the check without a peep.  Not even, \"Can I get you anything else?\"  She comes back to get the check after I had signed for it and has the audacity to just stand there awkwardly at our table and stare at it... As if she's getting more than what she truly deserves!  Oh wait, she already did!  For a food network star restaurant, food is probably a 2 or 3 (not horrible, but still disappointing) but service from this chick... 0.  She's lucky she got anything out of us.  I should have played the stupid foreign tourist card and left zilch $ for zilch effort.  There's a math wiz.",

But not only that the server brings out one plate forgets to bring out our other dish so I finish eating and our server still hasn't brought out our other plate and when he does its cold. By then I think we were already annoyed and ready to just leave. Not to impressed and wouldn't be back especially with the amount of quality restaurants in the area.",

The bartender was very nice even though he was busy and made time to make us feel welcome, and made some great suggestions for food. We took his suggestion and got the nachos, which were more than enough for two people and were amazing!   We went back with 4 people, and the line out the door was dizzying. Luckily, we asked some people at the bar to move over, which they graciously did, so we had room for all of us at the bar. The bartenders again went out of their way to make sure we loved the mixed drinks they served, and even re-made one for me and let us keep both.  Food was great too.  We plan on coming back if we are nearby next time in Vegas!",

With enough sauce (on the sweet side) we made it through half of the rack. It would have been pointless to ask for a replacement portion.

I questioned the lollipop style wings, but again, blown away. Tender and flavorful.  Skip the ahi tacos. They weren't fresh and tasted fishy. But were well presented.  The snores monte cristo is a must!!!! Deep fried godliness. We split it between 5 people and could barely finish due to it's richness.  Seating is a touch limited.

Indoor dining has full on sports bar feel with wide screens on all walls, pillars and posts. Patio dining offers covered outdoor eating with heaters blasting for cold days and a view of the pedestrian traffic on the strip. Decor all over is off the chain fun and party ready.  I ordered the award winning Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger. It did not disappoint. This may be one of the best burgers in the whole town: great chew, good texture. The mac & cheese are eclectic and a very cool surprise on a burger. The order of Quad Fries featured their \"house blend of sidewinder, waffle, julienne + crinkle cut french fries, served with bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce, house-made ranch + ketchup\". These were so good and the clean, orderly presentation was a great touch.  What's my bottom line? Good? Better than good! As Guy would say: \"This is off the chain! Off the hook!

The portion was fine, I feel as though the plate was very dry it could use more sauce. It had a beautiful presentation and had a fun set up process that was tableside, however i was expecting a more moist, juicy style of brisket on the nachos.  Sat on the  patio it was a bit loud, may be nicer to sit inside.  I would give it another try, but wouldn't mind checking out some of my other food network stars' spots",

The chili fries had dimensions of flavor, as the fries were smothered with chili and cheese.   The service was good just a bit slow, but while seating outdoors it was quite entertaining to people watch, that waiting for our food was not an issue. One thing to note that given the cold weather, wait time for indoor seating was about 1 hr. Outdoor seating had no wait time with plenty of heaters.

We were surprised it was only very short wait to get seated on a Saturday night.    Their \"trash can nachos\" were a giant pile of mess - flavorless neon yellow cheese sauce, dry toppings, and somewhat stale chips. A blind child could make better nachos than these folks.   Their sriracha wings were fall-off-the-bone, but lacked any spice or seasoning you'd expect. I've had better wings at dive bars.   Lastly, their Motley Que sandwich was the biggest disappointment. Dry, unseasoned pork with little to no smoke taste.   Our server was friendly, so I'll bump the rating up to 2 stars.",

I don't mind if at that time the place was crowded but when we came, there were so many available tables.  When I requested to be moved, she mumbled words I didn't understand and she made us feel that what we were requesting something that will be extra work for her. She showed us to another table and just left. This happened today, before 10 AM, Saturday, April 17, 2019.  That experience was complemented by our friendly server, Greg. He kept checking on us and made sure we were enjoying our food.",

I am not usually impressed with restaurants that have celebrity names attached to them, especially one that is on the Las Vegas strip where they will be busy, no matter the day, time, event etc.   We were a party of 6 and we were seated within 15 minutes during the dinner rush.  Our table was outside and it was probably a good mood as the inside seems noisier.  When you walk in, you get a glimpse of a large open kitchen which gives you a view of the food as it handed over the counter to the servers.   The menu has some interesting things to chose from, most from Guy's picks from his hit Food TV show \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\".  I went with Motley Cue bbq sandwich and someone else with us ordered the bacon mac & cheese burger.  Other orders included the Morgan's Veggie burger and the Tattted up Turkey burger.  There was also a order of Trash can nachos on order, which didn't disappoint.  This one is probably better ordered in a group like ours as the amount of cheese can dampen the appetite.   The presentation of it adds to it.  When it is brought out, it is in a large tin cup and the server will lift it up so that all the contents cascades out onto a plate!  The sandwiches had no complaints and were all good. The waitress told us that the most popular sandwich was the pulled pork and the nachos were the most popular appetizer, so I went with the recommendation.  A little pricey, but like I said earlier, there is a celebrity name attached and the location!   I would be back, but no sure if it would be a must stop on my trips to the 9th island.",

This restaurant was located right on the strip, so it was easy to walk too. Having heard of the TV show and knowing the reputation of the food inside, we decided to check it out.  The mac & cheese burger was delicious! It's one of my favorite combinations, but I don't see as many restaurants market this. I was delighted to find out this was one of their specialty burgers and even won several prizes over the years. So good!  It's about $20 for a burger--but to be honest, it's why we found throughout town. Just know when you walk in, you were going to splurge and have a delicious dinner. The food portions are humongous, so you could definitely split items around the table to be able to try different menu options. The girl sitting next to us got nachos as an appetizer, and it became her meal as it was enough to fill a couple people!   Great restaurant--highly recommend!",

So we got there was seated right away but the girl that sat us was not all that friendly anyway we received our menus not much of a selection and only 1 steak choice which was around $40.00 something and I ordered trash can nachos was like $20.00 first off the young guy that brought our food that was taking off the cab around the nachos dropped half of the toppings on the table and didn't even apologize or offer to bring another one. 2nd our food was cold mentioned it to the waiter advised him the food was not as expected and the food was cold the steak Was decent it wasn't all my gosh this is amazing it was not worth the price... For it to have Guy's name it was a shame the food was horrible and the waiter came back said he's sorry and he had mentioned it to his boss and they were Going to take care of us anyways our bill came and they gave us a seven dollar discount..

I was not disappointed. It was so delicious that I can't stop smiling while trying it. The serving is so big though and was not able to finished up -  it can be split up by two. It's a bit pricy.   The servers outfit were comfortable -jeans, boots and jerseys, showing the place should be comfy enough for its customers. The sporty decorations spirited the place. I agreed , we were comfortably dined - was immediately seated, attentive service was provided, relaxed atmosphere led to a happy experience.   A place to go when in the area.",

My friend had a manhattan type thing and I had the Not So Lemon Drop which was very strong. We also started off with the Lettuce Cup appetizer. This thing was huge, easily could have fed 3 or 4 and it was presented really well.  For our entrees my friend got the Kobe Burger which was done to perfection and was huge. I got the Hawaiian \"huli\" chicken sandwich. It was very tender and flavorful. My favorite part about both entrees though is the fries you get with it. It's a mixture of all types of fries which I think is kind of fun!  I gave 4 stars however, because we sat outside and they had TVs blaring as well as music playing so loud we couldn't even hear ourselves think. We actually paid the bill and had boxes waiting before the burgers even came and when they did we boxed them up and took them back to the hotel to eat.  This won't stop us from coming back again, we will probably just stay inside next time lol.",

I ended up thinking not and I stopped short of finishing it.  Voted the best burger in Vegas, Guy's bacon mac and cheeseburger ($21.50) was loaded with bacon, six-cheese mac and cheese, more cheese, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and his donkey sauce which I got on the side. Despite all of these ingredients, the burger was bland. Bland! Impossible it seems when I took the bin off to see topping after tipping but the meat was flavorless and missing any seasoning and the mac and cheese was too. How disappointing!  I did love the mixed fries however. Crinkle fries, waffle fries, and potato slices came with every burger. Those, I finished!  After making this my first stop when I landed in Vegas so I could grab this burger before they closed, I was disappointed by the quality of the burger and particularly for the price.",

It was packed when we went in but it was on a weekend so it is understandable. The host weren't very approachable ( when I say crowed I mean packed at the front door as if there is no where to sit and wait.) there was not any lager system, just simply have to hear for your name..I didn't care for that idea too much.   My babes and I usually go to the bar if it's a wait. There was enough space for maybe 6ppl so we decided to eat at the bar instead. No wait!! So we scored in a way lol   The menu looked pretty tasty! We wanted to try the mac n cheese burger but weren't to hungry. So we ordered the trash can nachos. We usually do look at the reviews on yelp before going most places. Which the pictures had us sold..however the nachos didn't really come with melting cheese or look that good. But you know what they say..some foods just taste better then it looks. And that's exactly what happened! It had some bbq pork on it which really set them off!   Our bartender was pretty nice, quick and straight to the point. He did suggestive selling. We got two beers in a good time.   No major complaints, presentation just could've been better along with the seating situation.",

The bacon wrapped shrimp were  marginally better, though the bacon over powered the really bland shrimp.  I expected better quality from a restaurant with the Guy Fieri name attached to it.",

Paid a ridiculous amount for a burger that was okay, but probably not worth half it's cost. Then I dropped another chunk of money on this \"amazing\" cheesecake. Mind you, I LOVE sweet and salty combos so thought this would be the best thing ever. It was so gross I threw it out. Mostly the cheesecake itself ruined it. There was just no flavor and what flavor it had wasn't good. Sadly, this is standard Strip food--okay but way overpriced, you can't really get around it. I won't go back but someone else may enjoy it.",

With all of the amazing places to eat in Las Vegas, seriously dodge this place.  To start things off, the first drinks two of us got(only two of us were drinking) were so bad that they were hard to drink. Not only that, but they didn't even come until our food got there. We had them replaced and ended up getting those drinks near the end of the meal. This alone isn't nearly enough for a 1 star.  I ordered the vegetarian burger and it was somehow the best of any of the four meals we ordered. Two of my friends got burgers, the wagyu burger as well as the mac & cheese burger, the last of the four of us got a full rack of ribs. We always eat family style so everyone can try a wide variety of the menu, and the consensus was in, never again. To top it off the fries looked SO GOOD... they weren't. They weren't bad but I could've bought a bag of frozen fries at the grocery store and done the same.   All and all, the service was incredibly slow, the drinks weren't even worth drinking(and trust me, I'm easy when it comes to drinks) and worst of all the food was simply unimpressive all the way around. I had high hopes because of the name and cost per plate, figured we couldn't go wrong, we did.   The burgers were simply not good.",

Ordered the nachos as an appetizer and wow those things were delicious! I ended up ordering a burger and it was nice and big, so big I could not finish it. Overall this is a cool spot, the service was great and the food was good. One thing to know is the bathroom sits outside the restaurant, it's in the casino (Linq). Also no outside drinks but there is an area near the cashier where you can leave it until your done.",

My bf and I shared the Trash Can Nachos and Bacon Mac & Cheese burger which was votes the best burger in Vegas. The nachos were good and the portion was more than enough for two it had brisket, cheese, and all the other fixings! I liked it, but after munching on it for a while I started to get tired of the sweet BBQ flavor. The burger was the winner for me here.. it had a crazy amount of flavor and it was HUGE! It came with waffle fries which were salty to me and regular fries that did not taste fresh. Overall, I liked it here but nothing really blew me away.",

The one drink I had was overpriced at $15 or so, and not great.  The burger was wet and messy, and not in a very good way.  More John Tapper than Guy Fieri.  For some reason there's a box of Slim Jims in with the liquor bottles, I kept wondering if there was some drink that featured one, but I didn't dare ask.  Felt rushed in and out.  I was fed, it wasn't awful, but I wouldn't go back.  Instead I'll try to find my own \"dive\".",

I love nachos (who doesn't?!) and she went on and on about how good they were, that I had to try them out.  They are called \"trash can brisket nachos\", and they come in a metal cylinder, which the server removes at your table.  They probably get their name from the metal cylinder, but regardless, I think the name is quite fitting: they taste like trash.   At $20, the nachos weren't cheap (and being from Canada, they are closer to $25 with the lousy exchange rate), but my partner and I could only take a couple of bites before giving up.  They tasted just AWFUL.  So bad. I tried to eat them because they were so expensive, but I had to admit defeat after four or five pieces. We paid our bill and left the plate practically untouched.   Lesson learned: if the name of the food has the word \"trash\" in it, don't eat it.  I suspect my coworker may have been extremely drunk when she ate there.

When we were able to get seated after a brief wait we were seated immediately and drink orders were taken.  We ordered the pizza sticks, some beers, a bloody Mary. The fries that accompanied the sandwich were completely and unnecessarily covered in an extremely salty seasoning which took away from any actual potato taste. The sandwich meat was tasty but again was overwhelmed by all of the items that came with the sandwich. The pizza sticks were delicious, but again on the salty side which on a hot Vegas afternoon, is not cool. The drinks were ice cold and great but the food was a bit too much even for me.  I didn't have a bad experience but I feel like I'm being very generous giving this place 4 stars. It's hard to explain. I would go there but maybe just for a drink or two and an appetizer.

    "text": "Big burgers for a big bite for lunch! Guy Fieri definitely doesn't do things small. The burgers and sandwiches served here are definitely gourmet and large. I tried the infamous Motley Que sandwich. There were large portions of pulled pork in a spicy barbecue sauce. Topped with fresh pickles and cheddar cheese, this was an excellent choice. For an appetizer we tried the pepperoni sticks with white cheese sauce. I definitely do NOT recommend these. The sticks were very, very dry and bland. I did also try the bloody Mary. It came with a large array of additions including a sausage link, a piece of shrimp, bacon, celery and pickled cauliflower. It was definitely a meal in itself.",

The weird assortment of fries was small. Not worth the $21.00 I paid. Had to ask to get more water so I could wash that dry burger down. I would not eat here again.

I don't care much about mac n cheese, but their corn bread was absolutely delish! I ate it all in three bites.   There was a long wait when we got there.

Had their famous \"Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger\", it was really good, the other person is my party had the \"The Steak Sandwich\" where he enjoyed! They are semi messy burgers/sandwiches but totally worth it. The atmosphere was actually really good, music was not over powering where you couldn't hardly hear the person next to you. One thing that was different was their french fries they mix up all different types from crinkle, steak, waffle styles, made them even better.

The ambiance is very fun and upscale divey which was perfect for what we were looking for.   We ordered the pepperoni stick fondue which honestly was way too rich. The meat crumbles on he top of the cheese just made it worse. The taste was just weird. My friend felt instantly upset to her stomach after the first piece.   I went ahead and ordered the mac and cheese burger for my entree. The mac and cheese was nothing special, a little bland in flavor and the burger was burnt and had no seasoning whatsoever.   I liked that the fires were a mix of curly and crinkle and regular.   Other than that the overall eating experience was a waste of time and money. I don't foresee another visit happening in the future to be honest.   This place seems awesome in theory but the execution could have been a million times better  Friend and I left super bummed out on the food. We expected so much more.",

I ordered a burger it was just OK .. not bad just OK not dripping juicy like I thought it would be at this restaurant the fries came out cold I had to send them back five minutes later they did give me new fries were hot and they were good. I love guy I'm a big fan of his show and was really looking forward to coming here. Like I said unfortunately the burger was disappointing . Burger cost 19.50  almost 20 bucks for Vegas prices on the strip i'm not complaining about that it's just I was expecting a big fat juicy dripping full of flavor  burger and I got a big burger. The waiter was fast though and attentive but not bothersome although he really didn't have a personality he did do his job.",

Anyway, I have been here a couple times and each time I thoroughly enjoyed my time!  I love the vibe of this whole restaurant. From the really big ice cubes they serve with your drinks, the design of silverware, to the uniforms that the workers have to wear, this restaurant is so fun!  I ordered Guy-talian Fondue Dippers as an appetizer, which were so good dipped into the smoky provolone cheese dip. I ordered a Tatted-Up Turkey Burger as my entree. The pretzel bun was really good, and the burger itself was huge! My favorite part is their fires. They mix several different types of fries together, which I think is really fun. The only thing is that they don't serve a lot of fries with the entree and I definitely could have eaten more of them. I also dipped my fries into the left over smoky provolone dip and it was really tasty.   The second time I went it was late at night so they had a smaller A La Carte menu. I order the Southern Smothered Chili Bowl, and a side of fries. The fries were the same mixture as the first time! The chili bowl was really good, but the corn bread wasn't anything special like I had hoped.   The service was great each time I went. Everyone is really lively and upbeat just like the restaurant is. Overall I really enjoyed my experiences here and I definitely will be coming back!",

It was like a cross between a saloon/log cabin with flat screens to make it a more accessible place for men, so they can eat and watch the game. It looks like a place where modern day, tough-guy bikers are supposed to hang out..with those skulls on the napkins ha!   They had an okay seating area, but the staff didn't clean it very well. They left tons of crumbs on the seats!!   SERVICE: 4 - The staff was awesome. Super friendly and funny! They are also very young and some are good-looking ;)   But, I felt like I was seated after a very long time. There were quite a few \"closed sections\"..and even after waiting a super long time, they still didn't clean the table well, which was a little gross.   FOOD: 3 - The food was definitely average. I had the truffle fries and the Fireball Whisky Wings. Both of which were served pretty lukewarm, which was not that pleasant. I wanted it to be served hot!!!   Their system of leaving warm things out is ineffective. It leaves the food way, way too cold for my taste. I would have rather taken my food scalding than barely warm. The food would have been way better if served hot.   The highlight of the wings was the bleu cheese wasabi dipping sauce. It was a great combination and made the chicken loads better! Truffle fries were good, but nothing to write home about. My parents ordered the burgers, and they are probably the best things on the menu.   In conclusion, it was just okay. I just really wanted hot food--being served cold food made it taste old and not newly cooked.",

There was a wait when we arrived for linner about 4pm...just roll on over to the secksy azz bar: full menu served, great drinks, & hot nice service! Our absolute fav was a cocktail with Jameson, mint, & other goodness....sooo refreshing & a taste bud pleaser! Get it!  We shared the Guy-talian fondue (or...Guy-Taliban as my autocorrect keeps saying...lol!). Absolutely ingenious! Long pretzel sticks wrapped in greasy yummy salami...dunk it in the cheese sauce (meh). The star? Besides the salami....the peppercinis! I'm not a big fan but these ones were superb: crunchy, spicy, perfect.   We also got the spicy wings...wings were meh, but the blue cheese wasabi sauce was like foreplay, y'all. Dip the crunchy fresh veggies on the side into it, slather the wings in it, don't waste it!  I've NEVER observed SO many burgers leaving a kitchen, seriously. Look good, must be good. About 3/4 of the plates leaving the kitchen are burgers.   I'd return next time I'm in Vegas! Kudos, Guy!",

    "text": "Extremely underwhelming. Let me first start off by saying that my boyfriend and I decided to head to Flavor Town solely as the punchline of a joke... In no way did I expect the entire experience to be a joke.  We came towards the end of the night, so as we were seated, we were given a late night menu - which is fine. Lots of places do that. There were a few not-very-different things you could choose from, including a drink menu. By \"not-very-different,\" I mean maybe 3 different burgers, 2 different kinds of wings, something called \"Vegas Fries\"... Not a whole lot of variety, which surprised me. So, my boyfriend went with an $18 bacon burger (can't remember the name) and I got the \"Vegas Fries\" for $13 - which was the cheapest thing on the menu, mind you... My only thought was, \"Well, this sh*t better be good.\"  Boy, was I wrong. My boyfriend said his burger was okay. Nothing special and definitely not worth $18. The \"Vegas Fries\" were also lackluster. They should change the description to something a little more fitting, something like \"Potato wedge spirals drenched in buffalo sauce and warm bleu cheese. No, seriously, DRENCHED. So sopping wet that these weird fries will fall apart in minutes if you don't eat them NOW.\" They were just plain gross. And there's no way anyone could eat the amount they give you. It's like 10 f***ing lb. of spicy mush potatoes. So unnecessary.  On top of that, the service was spotty. We were helped by like, 3 different people because our waitress decided to giggle on her phone RIGHT BEHIND US. I really do not care if I see someone on their phone, please just do your job in the meantime... but that was absolutely ridiculous.  The one redeeming quality of this place is the decor. So corny, so meme-worthy. You couldn't take 10 steps without seeing Guy Fieri's big, red face. The patio area was nice despite it being 110 degrees at 11:00 PM. Woulda been cool to feel misters or something. Oh well. Don't care. Will not be coming back.",

The place has a great set up, inside and out... although the restrooms are outside the resteraunt, common for vegas.   I ordered the Bacon Mac N Cheese burger, upon arrival the burger was huge and looked very enticing. But I was saddened that the outside was rather burnt and the inside was very dry and lacked much flavor. The fried are a mixture of all the fries they have and boy the truffle fries mixed in were so good. If I ever return I will definitely  be ordering those.   The bf got the Original Ringer, It has donkey sauce on it... neither of us could figure out what the sauce was. He said the burger was just alright.  All in all the food was presented beautifully, servers, busters and hostess looked well put together and did not bother us during the meal.

It already comes spicy *beware* & he ordered it extra spicy & he was sweating by the time he finished it. After seeing his & trying it, I ordered one as well. I'm a big of a bloody mary snob & rarely like them, but this was the best bloody mary I've ever had! And, the best part was, it was $13!! $13 on the strip! It made us feel like we've been getting ripped off our whole lives. We recommend!",

I've been to some DDD hotspots that really didn't impress me. So I wasn't totally sure what to expect at his own restaurant.   Well it's like this. The place has his personality. A little bit wild yet restrained. The greeters were nice and gave good estimate of how long it would take to be seated.   The waiter was great. Nice guy who really attended to us in all ways. Food was big and bold and tasty. A bit messy but that was half the fun. I ended up licking my chops and my fingers to keep from soiling the skull napkins.   The fries were fun. A wild mix of almost every imaginable style of fried potato. All of the BBQ meats were smokey and tender. Not sure what \"donkey sauce\" is but it was yummy.   The bar drinks were unique and enjoyed very much. Jameson and ginger - who other than Fieri would dram that up. But it worked.",

We waited about 15 minutes, which usually isn't too bad except that there are only about 5 seats available and 20 people waiting. Once seated, we had a hard time hearing our server because the music was so loud (it was good music though). The food presentation was great, but the taste was pretty average. I got the bacon mac and cheese burger because what else would i get. It didn't seem like there was too much mac and cheese on it and the burger was pretty well done. Tasted OK, but it was pricey.",

    "text": "Really disappointed by this spot. I ordered the Montly Que BBQ Pull Pork Sandwich. Meat was tuff; definately needed to be cooked longer to soften the shoulder meat. This sandwich was okay.   My boyfriend ordered their \"award\" winning Mac n Cheese Burger. LOL nothing winning about this burger. It was super gross to me. Way waay worst than my sandwich. Where's why:  The lettuce used was the same nasty subway lettuce. To describe it- it tasted like the lettuce was not covered in the refrigerator and tasted like the fridge chemicals. It over powered the entire burger. The patty was over cooked so it made the burger dry.   Fries:  Our orders came with the Quad Fries. It was cool. Had a selection of 4 types of fries. Just wished the fries were a bit crisper. But thats just a personal choice.   Customer service: Average. Not bad, but not great either.   Pros 1. Location: has outside patio seating. Conveniently located on the strip.  Overall :: Not good. With the tuff pull pork, overcooked patty and the lettuce they use I recommend you go somewhere else for a burger.",

    "text": "It's like Guy Fieri walked into a room in The LINQ.  Suddenly, somebody lit his hair on fire.  It rapidly burned down like a fuse.  And then, he exploded.  That appears to be how Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar was decorated.  The staff then found a stray pool of his blood, and used it as ink to write the menu -- All the while being possessed by his ghost, which was summoned by watching \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" in reverse on an upside down television.  What I'm getting at:  If you know anything about Guy Fieri, you'll know what to expect.  And you may even enjoy it, if you're the type to walk into a Hooters or TGI Fridays and think that their American-Dude-Bar-Kitch vibe is just a bit too tame.  This is a serviceable restaurant.  If you find yourself in Vegas, on this particular part of the strip, and cannot possibly manage to walk another 500 feet to some place (any place) better, then I guess you could do worse.  The fries we had as an appetizer were good.  Our party ordered both the Vegas Fries and the Truffle Fries.  Because, Vegas.  And french fries.  When the waiter recommended the ribs, I thought, sure.  Hell yeah.  If there's one thing this Food Network Frosted-Tip Chef in Chief knows how to put on a menu, it's probably ribs.  Oh god.  Oh god no.  No no no no no.    Three of us ordered the ribs.  So dry.  So overcooked and burnt, they were nearly inedible.  The responsible waiter even seemed to understand that the ribs were a huge mistake, and came back to check on us mere minutes after delivering them.  He didn't ask if everything was good.  He didn't ask if there was anything else we needed.  He straight-up asked, \"are you sure you want to eat those ribs?\"  No, thank you, kind sir.  We did not.  He took them all back, and we went with different variations of the burger.  The burger was fine.   It was cooked to our preferred temperatures.  Nothing special, especially compared to many options you may find within a Vegas block of this place.  That waiter, along with the good fries and decent burger, saved this review from being one star.  But really, ask yourself, if there are other options available, why are you going here?",

    "text": "We're Vegas locals so we decided to brave the strip on a Saturday night and try Guy's new restaurant.  First off, this place is very small for being a celebrity chef restaurant. The door to get into the place could easily be mistaken for a service entrance, if not for the long line of people waiting to try to cram themselves through it.  After making our way to the hostess stand, we were told that our party of four would have a 45-minute wait before we could be seated. We had no problem waiting, but the inconvenient part about that is they don't give you a pager so you can freely roam about while you're waiting. You have to hope that you're in the cramped entry space and within earshot of her calling out the names of parties when it's time for your party to be seated, otherwise you get skipped.  After we waited our allotted 45 minutes, we were seated and proceeded to order drinks. I personally tried the Guido's freaky Tiki and the Austin sweet tea. Guido's freaky Tiki is ok by most standards, but the sweet tea was terrible and I ended up sending it back.  We ordered the trashcan nachos and the Vegas fries for appetizers for the table. Three of us ordered the original ringer burger, and my brother ordered the mac and cheese burger.  After 25 minutes our appetizers came out. The trash can nachos were amazing. The Vegas Fries however didn't come with enough blue cheese dressing to warrant the fact that the fries are HEAVILY coated in Buffalo sauce and they give you about 8 whole potatoes worth of fries. Basically, enough dip for one person and enough fries for 10 people.   It took a full 90 minutes from the time we ordered to get our burgers. To make matters worse, my brother's girlfriend didn't even get the burger she ordered. She was given a mac and cheese burger just like my brother, but since the wait was so long to even get the food to the table in the first place, she ate it anyway because we didn't want to have to wait another hour and a half for them to correct the problem.  The burgers were OK at best. They were juicy, but the onion ring on mine was burnt to say the least, and it seems that everybody at the table had a hard time trying to keep all of the toppings on the burger together when eating it. I know they are going for the whole Guy Fieri hunch that he does on Triple D to have to eat the burger, but it's a little inconvenient when nothing wants to stay on the bread. The burgers are served with three different cuts of french fries because, why not; and a side of ketchup.   Our server seemed pretty annoyed with the tables he was serving and tried to come around as little as physically possible while we were there. We saw another server who was an attractive blonde, but she had RBF really bad and my brother and I even joked that she might die if she cracked a smile. In fact, the whole staff seemed like they hated you for being there and taking up their valuable time.  On two different occasions, our server came to the table and refilled a glass of Sprite with water because they weren't paying attention. Our server going as far as to say my brother was \"going to give (him) an aneurysm\" for pointing it out.  To anybody considering this restaurant, I say, do yourself a favor and walk around the corner and go to Margaritaville instead. The food is better, the staff is more friendly, the atmosphere is more fun, and there's more room to move. Plus they have live music on the weekends.",

The wait was incredibly long. We waited for about 45mins for a table outside. The restaurant itself is what you'd expect for a pub with a bit of a country feel. The staff as friendly, our server was hard to catch due to how busy they are.   We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese burger. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty big. The pork was tender and moist. The sauce was perfect. The mac n cheese burger is their most ordered item on the menu. You can't go wrong ordering this. It's just mouth watering and the meat is juicy with the right seasoning. Both order come with fries. We also ordered the deep fried ice cream which was good if you love ice cream. The dessert is perfect for sharing between 2-4 people.   Will definitely go back",

Well, with my last trip to Vegas, I went there with an open mind and I was really impressed.  And definitely blown away with generous portion sizes they serve.  Note that I went here with my mom just for a late lunch\\afternoon snack since we were having dinner elsewhere later that night.  The real main reason why I decided to eat here was because I saw their Sashimi Won-Tacos on Eater Vegas.  They looked incredible!  So I ordered that and by the host's recommendation, we ordered the BBQ Brisket Trash Can Nachos as well.  SASHIMI WON-TACOS -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2inEqUO&s=2302efee263dbb91c511e9cd3008db4f6bdfc56a7a21cc2df8abcedc9c8647cc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2inEqUO</a> sashimi-grade ahi tuna packed into crispy wonton shells with mango-jicama salsa, sweet soy, scallions + wasabi cream The tacos were amazing!!  They're basically like tuna tartare in taco form but they looked pretty and tasted delicious.  Although the portion size is a bit small, you do get four tacos and a good amount of tuna inside each one.  It's a great appetizer that can also be just a light afternoon snack.  TRASH CAN BRISKET NACHOS -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2inJZ5Q&s=6a9441a762be963d9e51750cca10678f290bb80981893b9c9bdfb45d8330febe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2inJZ5Q</a> corn tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce, jalapenos, crema, pico de gallo, house-smoked beef brisket burnt ends + chipotle BBQ sauce Whoa!!  This was a hot mess, but a tasty hot mess.  It comes to your table literally in a small trash can and then the server unloads it on the serving plate.  It's an impressive site to see and a smart way to prepare and serve nachos since there wasn't a single chip that was naked.  And I was glad to see that they didn't skimp on the brisket and cheese sauce.  The brisket was smokey and full of flavor and there was so much cheese sauce that I really couldn't stop eating the nachos.  I'm glad I got to share this with my mom because I definitely couldn't tackle this all by myself.  I wouldn't mind coming back again to Guy Fieri's.  I want to try more things off their menu.  Their Mac & Cheese Burger was voted the Best Burger in Vegas so I'm definitely going to have to go back and try it.  Though it's a little up there in price, it's still a great gastropub that can be enjoyed any time of the day since they're open for breakfast, lunch, happy hour, dinner, and late night.",

My friend got the trash can nachos.  They totally had potential, but there were only a few small pieces of pork, they were already cold, they definitely weren't \"shareable\", and for $20 they should have scored better. I got the lobster lollipops.  5 tempura battered chunks of lobster were good, but the Old bay covered SMC (Super Melty Cheese) fries they were supposed to be served with were really, really bad.  Also something they called \"shareable\", they came in a fairly small cup, were completely cold, and honestly tasted like they had been sitting on some back counter for a few hours.  I asked about the cheese that I thought was going to be covering them and he said it was in the sauce.  They came with a little cup of sauce that tasted like Old Bay mayo, and didn't have any sign of cheese.  I think Guy needs to drop in, because this restaurant is not living up to his name...",

I had the big BBQ sampler myself and barely finished it. Better to share, of course but I wanted to try the BBQ. The quality was above average for everything included.

The food was great the best part was the appetizer, the lettuce cups, omg so delicious. I ordered the cajun chicken alfredo which was just ok and drenched in a whole lot of sauce. If I would have known I would have asked for easy on the sauce/cream. My fiance ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was very delicious. Everything was great too bad they didn't have a bigger selection of dessert. They had only four to choose from so I passed. Will definitely be back.",

At that time I would have rated it at a three, but the food was much better than I remembered on my recent visit.   Noon on a Saturday is a busy time to visit. The wait for a table was about 20-30 minutes and we had plans so we opted to sit at the bar instead. The bar was serving the full menu and the chairs weren't too crowded together so it was comfortable. I also liked that the bar chairs had backs on them for added comfort.   We started with Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers. The breadsticks were nice and flavorful. The fondue was creamy and I liked that the added flavors from the sausage, tomato, and basil. It was a unique appetizer and we enjoyed it. The bread and cheese combination made for a hearty appetizer.  After the hearty appetizer we decided to split the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger. It was a really good burger and didn't seem as oversized as the other burgers. All of the flavors worked together well and I enjoyed the pretzel bun twist. The fries on the side were also really good and I enjoyed the seasoning on them. It was fun that the fries were a mix of shoestring and waffle.  The bartenders were good about constantly refilling our waters and taking our orders quickly. The appetizer came out quickly, but the entree took a little more time. Overall, service was good though.",

Made the mistake of ordering the trashcan nachos as an appetizer before our burgers. Why was it a mistake? Because we ended up devouring them and had to take the burgers to go. They were delicious. Perfect comfort food.  Later on in the evening I took a bite of the regular burger. I have to say it was one of the best burgers I've had. The meat was super duper flavorful. It also comes with French fries (seasoned) and some sort of crisscut wedges.   It's open til midnight, which for the strip is amazing. I would definitely go back and try other dishes. Yummmmm!!!!!!",

There are a lot of gourmet type burgers on the menu. I'm not really into that so the menu didn't really appeal to me. The fries were a mixture of different types of fries in one batch. The burger didn't look big but it was thick so we got full quick. I found nothing spectacular about my meal that would make me have to go back. It wasn't bad either but I've had much better burgers before. Go for the name and experience if you just have to try it.",

    "text": "I don't really know how I feel about this place.  Boyfriend and I was super stoked when we found out that Guy have a restaurant in the strip. I watched his shows here and there but my boyfriend loves him. Lol, literally. Anyways we decided to eat here for lunch and the wait was about 25-30 minutes. Not bad considering how packed it was.  I wasn't too hungry so I got the general's wings and my boyfriend got the original ringer burger with bacon. By the way, we loved how they have pepsi. HUGE PLUS. Anyways, didn't take long for food to come out, but wow presentation was great. For my wings at least. My boyfriend loved the burger. \"Wow\" \"this is so good\" \"omg\" was all that came outta his mouth. As for me, the wings were.. different. I'm not saying I don't like it but I wasn't in love with it either. It definitely tasted like something I've never taste before, which is a good thing. Unique. But I just can't put my finger on it, the taste of the wings were sweet and tangy. Hard to explain but it goes really well with the peanut they provided. I didn't finish the wings but if I could, I would give it a 7/10. Not my kind of taste bud but could be someone's else.   All in all, I enjoyed trying something new. Service was okay, could tell he was really busy with all his tables though I wished we didn't have to wait so long for our waters and pepsi.",

I told him this meal was not what I thought it would be. He did take the cost off the bill; however the proper thing would have been to tell me before bringing the food that they were out of beans so I could order something else.

Once order was taken we waited another 30-40 mins. I get it it was Saturday evening and alot of people but our server did not check on us once. Finally able to get his attention to try to change the pluthera of the same football game on TVs to the Dodger game. Never changed. We finally got food which was not half bad but can't mess up wings and a rice bowl too much. So other than that I would not try again. Oh well just like gambling you win some you lose some.",

Even the salads are either served in a giant crouton or wrapped in a meat bowl. We got the lettuce wraps which were decent, I wish they gave you more filling as the sauces took up 40% of the platter.   There are no options for kids unless your kids like food with a twist or with spice. I think the best part of this place is that orders of fries come with shoe string, criss-cut, crinkle cut, and twisted fries (variety is always nice). The decor of the place is great and the service was great as well.",

    "text": "We went to guys restaurant after hearing quite a few good reviews about it. so we went with a very open mind expecting quite a good meal. the wait was not too long before being seated, it was about 15 to 20 minutes not bad they were quite busy. We were seated on the patio right next to a swinging door. everytime the door open it would just about hit our table, terrible location to seat someone . we waited about 5 minutes at least before even being greeted. We waited another 5 minutes to get drinks to our table and by drinks I mean sodas and water. we ordered an appetizer which was the pepperoni pretzel and cheese dip, it was good so finally the time comes for our meals. I ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger expecting something really good. I was not overly impressed. there was not much flavor to the meat, macaroni and cheese was barely even noticeable and the burger. we ended up spending around $65 for two people no alcohol and one appetizer. I can't say I would return there again it was not much to write home about.  Once our meal was served, the waiter never even checked back until we were done with our meal . I think I'll stick with Five Guys Burgers and Fries next time for about 15 to 18 dollars. I hope management looks at this review and tries to find some ways to rectify these type of problems which I'm sure other customers have noticed.",

    "text": "First let me say I love Guy Fieri. We ate here 3 times this week and the food was 5 stars each visit.  With that being said, on 2 of our 3 visits, our service was poor. From waiting 13 minutes after seating for our waiter to not being offered dessert. On one visit, we were asked if we were ready for our check. We said no we would like to see a dessert menu. After about 5 minutes our menu arrives. We then wait about 14 minutes for our waiter to come back. By then we decided to pass. This morning we ate breakfast here and waited 13 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. Let me note, they were not very busy.  So we finally order and received coffee. After running out of coffee and waiting and waiting, I decided to turn my cup upside down. Our waiter finally stopped by.  He used 2 curse words and made an off color comment about the portions being \"big and delicious, just like me\".  Really?  I love Fieri but there are plenty of restaurants with good food AND good service.",

We ordered the pepperoni pretzel appetizer thinking it was going to be oven baked pretzels with pepperoni served with the cheese dip. What we got was pretzel rods from a bag with cold pepperoni slices wrapped around them. The cheese dip was good but was cold by the time it made it to the table. Major disappointment. We kept an open mind for the main entrees. My friend got the bacon Mac n cheese burger with the house fries. The burger was huge but thin and didn't have a lot of Mac n cheese on it. The fries were dusted with seasoning and were decent. It was ok but the burger and truffle fries at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant Burgr were A LOT better. I had the Caesar salad which was enormous and by far the beat dish of  the meal. The salad was freshly tossed, cold and the croutons were delicious. Overall, a lack luster experience that failed to meet expectations.",

We know groups may present a challenge, but we were greeted nicely, given a wonderful roomy table, and our waiter Stephen handled everything like a pro. The atmosphere here is so Guy! You almost expected him to stroll in and sit down at your table and start sampling your food! The types of food he features on his shows is all represented here. Flavortown indeed! We found layers of flavors in everything we tried. I won't try to list it all here! We really felt his personality stamped on every detail. The Bloody Marys were a work of art! It was fairly pricey, but we've had less memorable meals for much more on the Strip. The people watching opportunities are great there too! We rolled out of there VERY happy we had tried it, and are still talking about how good it was!",

Our friend ordered the same thing and said the fries were way too spicy, but my Mom and I enjoyed the bold flavors! While the burger was huge, the fry portions were pretty small especially in comparison.  The people next to us RAVED about the Bloody Mary drinks. Like legit would not shut up about them. So, if you drink perhaps you should try one!  The wait was about 20 minutes on a Sunday at 12:30.  $20 for a burger and fries is a bit steep for us, but it was still worth it considering it is Guy Fieri's restaurant! :)   P.S. Adrian was a wonderful server!",

To me it was so loud in the restaurant that holding a casual conversation was damn near impossible so your best bet was to just hunker down, watch numerous tv's and simply just eat... The only real disturbing reality was that the employees all looked down right miserable, and the customer service suffered severely because of it. Our waitress was a primary example, poor girl looked like she was going to explode and I say that because she was pregnant and due very soon!  All the hostesses as well looked like zombies and struggled to mask their hangovers, it was quite clear they did not want to be at work and who's to blame them...  Management needs to be more involved with the staff on the floor, I feel like changes need to be made in order for the employees to look more uplifted.",

We went to the hostess and asked for a table for 2 outside.  She said it would be 30-45 minutes  What??? You could clearly see there were open tables and reservations were not allowed.  I asked why the wait when there were so many tables free.  She very rudely said, that's the way it is, you will just have to wait like the others.  Are you kidding me???  I could understand if she would have said they were short staffed but there were three girls just standing around.  Not the way to run a business when there are so many options in Vegas.  Very disappointing, take your money elsewhere. I am glad to recommend other options.  Sorry Guy :(",

The bar tender offered a bday shot and chatted with my and my husband. So Friday we went back for breakfast Hash House was waaaay to busy. We had a few more people but still got a tabel fast. The service was slow but Vegas never closes so we didn't have anyplace we had to be. I got the biscuits and gravy. Yummmy best biscuit I have ever had. Everyone is complaining about the price. Yes it was expensive it is the Las Vegas Strip nothing is cheap. I will surely stop bye again. I loved it the 4 stars was for the service lacking but no thing to keep me away.",

I had the Mac n cheese burger and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had. No wonder it won awards.  The other thing I loved was the fries, my burger came with like 5 different styles of fries. Enjoyed the variety - hot and delicious.  Service was friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend and return next time I'm in Vegas.",

We get here and although we are a large party of 12 the only thing the server kept bringing us was water. We placed our order and she got it wrong. When our order finally came out over an hour later our waitress had only checked in once. I complained to the manager when he checked in to see how everything was and she happened to be walking by so he told her to check in with us and it still took her another 20 min to come and ask if we needed anything. I understand being slammed but simply checking back with your party makes all the difference in the world! Service sucks, food was average and honestly I would never come back here or recommend this place to anyone.",

No clue the menu is basically burgers and sandwiches. No kids menu soo 13 bucks a kid or more.  We got the tripleT fries the triple D burger the dragon fries and the double barrel wings . We'll the food on par omg so good but from the loud music the squished seating and it was uncomfortable the messed up a beer order which we'll can pass.  The two shining lights in this place was our server Christopher and the flavor of the food.  The ambiance was hectic rushed and stressful the only working pos was outside sooo 30degree weather shooting Down my spine every time a server had to ring something up.

The service was FANTASTIC, our Waiter was very prompt with taking the order and getting our drinks to us. Once the order was taken we had our food within 20 minutes. I ordered the italian salad, it was absolutely DELICIOUS and it was displayed so pretty on the plate. My husband ordered the mac and cheese burger and loved it. The french fries were all different sizes, some spicier than others. Our bill was $45, which was great for \"Celebrity Chef's\" Restaurant.

They came with a buffalo sauce and blue cheese we also had the Mayor of flavor town which is a burger with pastrami, come slaw and beef. Both were equally amazing. They have an amazing menu and everything sounds different but delicious service could have been better but it was good. I love the layout nice cool place they had a bar as well. Will definitely be back to try some more things on this menu!!",

Both me and my friend took a couple bites and were over it. The waitress asked if I didn't like it and I told her I didn't care for it one bit. She didn't offer anything just said sorry.   Guy is a a celebrity chief. But probably the worst and over rated. He's smart though he uses his name to bring people to his crap restaurants. At least a lot of them got closed down. Hopefully this one will to I feel bad for tourist visiting they don't know better.",

    "text": "The place was filthy!  There was food all over the floor.  It's not like they were busy, which should have been our clue to leave, so someone could have been sweeping.  The food was good at first, but you can't eat much of it.  An example is the Fireball Whisky Wings.  They were good at first, but then the sauce got to me around the 3rd wing.  They weren't spicy at all, but they were very tangy and a bit sweet with a slight fireball taste, but I really couldn't eat a full order of them.  My wife didn't get past her 1st wing.  The Vegas Fries (which is a big order) were good, but after a few, we stopped using the sauces and knocked the cheese off because it was a bit much and I love Buffalo Sauce and Blue Cheese.  My wife and I also split the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger.  It was a VERY average, almost below average, burger.  Nothing special at all.  The pattie kept falling apart and the mac-n-cheese looked and tasted like something you get from a cheap cafeteria.  What happened to Flavortown on this one???  Very underwhelming food experience from a Chef that I really enjoy watching and I make a lot of his recipes.  As for the service...  Horrible!  The food came out quickly, but only because our waitress didn't run the food.  Our waitress was off doing who knows what because it took her almost 10 minutes to get 2 drinks.  Again, they weren't busy at all!  After we received our drinks, we didn't see our waitress again until we were ready to pay and leave.  I gotta say, this place is Guy Fieri's reputation and it definitely took a negative hit with me.  I'll stick with making his recipes and taking pride in what I put out, but Guy needs to take a good look at this place and fix a lot of issues before it needs to close.  We were thinking about going to Baltimore to check out his other Kitchen & Bar, but after this experience, we'll skip Guy's Kitchen & Bar the next time we're in the Charm City.",

I got the mac and cheese bacon burger, fondue dippers for an appetizer, and I've tried both the cheesecake and fried icecream and everything was amazing both times I've gone. The service on the other hand... let's just say if I wasn't as nice as I am there probably wouldn't have been a tip on table. Took 25 minutes to get the cheesecake out and around 5 minutes or more to just get a refill on my drink. That's the only thing keeping this from a 5 star on here. Also on a side note my second time going here a current or former employee who knew everyone there was constantly slowing things down by distracting and talking to all the workers while they were slammed, then proceeded to seemingly drunkenly drop a glass drink inches from my foot shattering the glass everywhere... one again If I wasn't a nice person the glass I later found in my shoe's sole would've been mailed to them requesting $200 to replace my shoes because my property was ruined but whatever. No complaints on the food or cooks though, I would think Guy is more than ecstatic about them. If you're looking for a professional staff (excluding the cooks) feel free to take a pass on here though.",

It was on a Sunday for lunch.   We got seated and was given a menu. We looked over the menu, but we had a good idea already as to what we wanted to order. So now we're just sitting, waiting, thinking over how are weekend was in Vegas since we were just hours away from going home. Well, that time passed and passed...okay so we're super hungry and we're still waiting for someone to introduce themself to us. My boyfriend had to flag down a server and tell them we we're waiting for service! On top of that, we still waited an extra three mins for someone to come by. When the guy did, he was honestly creepy. Plus he had just visited another table cuz he was carrying trays and menus. He asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then was going to get that, but we kinda were on a time crunch so we told him we were ready to order then too. Our food took awhile, but that was worth the wait.   I order the Double Barrel BBQ Wings, the BF ordered the Mac Cheese Bacon Burger. My friends ordered the Fireball Whiskey Wings and Sashimi Won-tacos. I loved my wings!!! So much flavor, and it came with some veggies. Plus on top of the wings were onion strings, yum! I had a piece of the burger and it was juicy and oily lol. I loved the fries that came with it. I also had a Fireball Wing. I didn't think it was that spicy, it was good, but spice wise, no. My friends also ordered Triple T Fries later on while we were eating. Those took foreverrrrr to come out!!! They were good though, but man.  The food was AMAZING! The service was TERRIBLE and SLOW! Our server took our checks and it took 12 mins! Why? I saw him making up a drink @ bar for another table of his. Isn't that the bartenders job?? Then he took to them and then did our checks! Like, if you're going to do that stuff @ least do it behind a solid wall, there wasn't even a wall to block him. I could see him!!!   Like seriously!!! It was like the server worked @ a fancy fancy restaurant where the service and speed was more on the slow side. This wasn't and isn't that kind of place. We got seated @ 12:55pm. I thought we were going to be there for like an hour and 15mins, NO! We were there till 2:36pm! I know this cuz we wanted to leave Vegas by 3pm. And we still had shopping to do. That was soooo annoying, not the way I wanted to end my last meal there. So yeah, our server costed my rating a star or else this would have been a 5 star review.",

Last time I ordered the The Mayor of Flavortown Burger and it very well could be one of the best burgers I've ever had. With that said I wanted to try the other famous burger on the menu this year, the Mac - N - Cheese Bacon Burger. Wow! So much going on with this burger and the mac & cheese blends in with the burger quite well. Overall I still prefer The Mayor of Flavortown Burger burger but both are worth trying.

My husband ordered the Mac n cheese burger. It didn't disappoint. Mac and cheese was well cooked with good flavor. He also commented on the taste of the burger patty itself. Saying it was seasoned well. Bun was delicious and lightly toasted.  I had The General's Wings. They smelled spicier than they actually tasted. Delicious flavor. A little sweet.

I mean there was a Yelp event here.  You would think we could get the name right.    We stopped in for a late dinner.  After 10 pm they have a limited menu, but are less busy so it's not too bad of a trade off.  There was a short line even though the restaurant inside and out was mostly empty.  Parties of 4 or less wait in line.  5 or more check in with the hostess.  When we got to the front we were asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside or at the bar.  We didn't have a preference until the hostess told it would be 15 min wait for inside/outside or we could sit at the bar right away.  So the bar it was.  Funny though that there was that much of a wait when there were dozen's of empty tables all around.    We sat at the bar and got a cider and a Guido's Freaky Tiki.  We ordered Fireball Whiskey Wings, Quad Fries and Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger.  OMG all of it was amazing.  So good.  I'll admit I was a little surprised.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  I don't like chicken wings and I loved these.  The burger was excellent.  Loved the fries and all the dipping sauces.  Portions are big enough to share.  Don't be like the people next to us were trying to give us their fries because they each ordered Quad Fries and it was way to much.",

As we were walking in several people were leaving, saying that they are only serving breakfast and they are not taking reservations for lunch. It was 10:30am exactly and they stopped serving breakfast at 11:00am. We were like great because we want breakfast. The lady ahead of us told the hostess there were two of them, she then said we are only serving breakfast is that ok? She told her no we wanted lunch and walked out. I then told her there is two for breakfast,  she then said it will be 25 to 30mins and you can then only order lunch not breakfast.   Which is funny that it's a 25 to 30min wait and the entire front had six people standing there, two of them us. Completely ridicules as there was 1/4 of the patio open with tables. So basically they were not seating anybody....for lunch or breakfast. Needless to say we will most likely never come back.",

The signature trash can nachos are actually really delicious. The brisket is cooked perfectly and the barbecue sauce mixes wonderfully with the nacho cheese. It really balances a hard night. The triple t fries, for the truffle, truffle oil, and truffle sauce are also ridiculously tasty.  The burgers are hand formed and seared beautifully. The portions are massive which more than justify the prices.  My only real complaint is how heavy and greasy everything is. It fits the spot for your hangover but you suffer a little bit afterwards.  Try the bloody Mary's, they have two slices of bacon, jalapeno, cucumber, sausage, and pickles. A very well made Mary.",

Took about 15mins to take our drink order, we ordered our food at the same time - just in case. The waiter had absolutely no personality (wrong profession, bad day?), slow/sluggish, never checked on us after the food was brought out, took about 25 mins after we finished to have our empty dishes cleared. Took even longer to get our bill.. Which he directly handed over the table, to my husband.. Although there are other people here with us. If suggest just laying it on the table next time or possibly ask if it needed split. Once we received it, we needed it split up. He didn't ask prior. We asked him to please split it. He kinda gave us a odd look and said it would be a few minutes.. Alright. 16mins later, we received the new checks. We waited 15mins for them to be taken - he asked if we needed change for the cash bills. Yes, our bill was 53$ and I gave him a 100$. Service was not worth a tip that large. He then told us it would be a while because his only cashier is the bartender. Okay?? Not our fault.. I wasn't giving him a larger tip because it was a inconvience for him to take the cash and bring us back change. We then spent another 15mins for our change. We spent most of our time waiting throughout our visit. Literally just sitting there.. Meh. Didn't get to leave until almost 1pm.........",

We checked on line before we came but the collection of tacos that were on line are no longer being served at the restaurant. Two tries in getting a lemon drop martin didn't result in a satisfactory drink. (One was deducted from the bill)My signature drink was a 10ounce glass that was one half ice. I had a chilaquilies and my dining partner a bowl of chili. She liked her chili, mine was like a breakfast burrito surrounded by corn chips with an avocado slice. Most of my chips were soggy and some were actually cold like they'd just been defrosted. The fresh slice of avocado was good. We were hoping for a \"oh wow\" moment that didn't happen. Total bill is $65. That's Vegas for you",

    "text": "We came here a year ago for drinks with friends. This was our first time trying out the food.   We were told the wait was going to be forty minutes for two. We headed to the bar to grab some drinks and see if we could score two seats at the bar. There were some tables available but they weren't cleared off quickly. We finally got two seats at the bar after 15 minutes. The service was kind of slow even though there were 2-3 bartenders. It took some time for our order to be taken.   We started off with the Vegas Fries...fries heavily tossed in buffalo sauce topped with blue cheese crumbles served with more buffalo sauce and blue-sabi sauce on the side. The buffalo sauce was too overwhelming for my liking. I definitely wouldn't dip the fries in more buffalo sauce. My husband and I didn't eat much of the appetizer.   I ordered the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger which tasted amazingly good! The burger patty was cooked and seasoned well. The bacon added a nice crispy texture, while the mac-n-cheese added creamy cheesy goodness. The brioche bun was the perfect choice of bun because of its buttery flavor. Every element of this burger tied in so well together! Quad fries, which consisted of four types of fries, were better than the vegas fries. The portion size was more than enough. I could not finish this burger on my own. Definitely would get this burger again!   My husband ordered the Motley Que sandwich. I had a couple bites. We both agreed the burger was better. It had a great smokey flavor, but that's all you taste. I would've loved to see some other flavors incorporated into the sandwich. It definitely was cheesy, but again the smoky flavor of the pork muted the flavors of the other components in the sandwich. It was served on a pretzel bun, which was mediocre to me and lacked some of the salty element. I've had better.   All in all, I give it 3.5 stars if I could. I would go back for that burger and may try the other burgers.",

From the minced chicken and chicken skewers, to the choices of three dripping sauces. So good!   Then the entrees came in. I had the brisket and my girlfriend had the first burger option on the menu - I can't remember the name they have for it   The brisket - for 30something dollars was a bit of a let down. Covered in a bath of sweet and tangy BBQ sauce and on top of two giant Texas toasts, you're not really giving the chance to taste the flavors of the actual brisket. It comes with an assortment of fries   The burger - a perfectly seasoned burger with crispy onion ring and a toasty bun. It was good.   Just as another yelper mentioned, in a town like Las Vegas, there are much better food options.",

Hostess was mostly inattentive and possibly hung over but she was able to seat us without ever making eye contact.  I found that to be incredible.  The wait staff was super friendly - not sure how with the short skirts the gals wear and the tight vests the guys don...  Everything looked as if the wrong cleaner went to work with hot water and a vengence.  Oh well...  it didn't stop them from being nice.    I got the steak and eggs and my little got the Chilaquiles.  My steak was cooked perfectly yet lacked a pop that I expected.  The Chilaquiles came recommended from our server and we were completely underwhelmed.  It just wasn't great.  That's really what I wanted - a great breakfast.  What we got was just okay.",

They gave us a table with only 10 seats and when we said there isn't enough seats for our party they said \"well you will just have to make it work or go back outside and wait\"? The hostess made a mistake and sat another party next to us so the two tables could not be combined and wasn't very helpful in getting the problem solved without a fight? Are you kidding me? How do you even call a party back and not have adequate seating?  Do we stand to eat? The hostess was not professional and eventually brought over another small table to accomodate our party. The waiter was very nice and the food was good and is the reason for the stars or else inwould.have given this place no stars.",

We were seated outside in one of the few locations not under the fans and the service started out okay with Nick but eventually there was none. He visited our table only once without being prompted to fill up only half of our water glasses in the 113 weather. We had to keep asking each time after that and then they left the pitcher in the sun so only luke warm water without ice was being poured.   Each of our orders was disappointing,  lacking flavor. Honestly,  other than the Triple T fries and the Vegas fries, the entire meal was a bust. None of us would recommend the restaurant to visitors of Vegas in the future.",

    "text": "The last time that I was in town I really enjoyed myself at this restaurant.  The food is good, but the  service at the bar is why I'm giving a one star rating. The one star is for my entire experience.  There was a wait for a table, so I decided to eat at the bar to save time.  Everything was fine until it was time to settle up and leave. I needed to leave and the bartender avoided making eye contact when i gestured for the check and ignored me when I asked verbally.   I needed to leave and the card was used to start a tab, so it should have been a quick and painless process.I't wasn't until I made a more obnoxious request that I was given the credit card slip to sign; and that was only after she was done making a cocktail for another guest.  When the credit card slip arrived the bartender said \"I'll be right back with a pen.\" When I glanced down at the slip it was not for my order, but for the two gentlemen sitting next to me. She attempted to joke with the other guests and said \"He's trying to pay for your meal.\"  She attempted to run my card, but said it didn't go through and that maybe because I was from California and sometimes the banks put holds on the cards. I then asked why my card was approved to pay for the bill for the guys sitting next to me.   The bartender said that my card wasn't charged for the guests next to me and told those guests \"Your check is $48.00 better than his.\" Very unprofessional.  If my card wasn't charged, then why did you tell me you'd be back with a pen? If I would have signed that would have been the end of it. It was a very unprofessional and rude experience at the bar.  If you decide to eat at this restaurant make sure to get a table in the dining area and not the bar.  If you have to eat at the bar and Lauren is serving double check your credit card slip.",

We walked in at 10:05pm on a Saturday night and immediately ordered a round of draft beers since they offer a late night Happy Hour.  However, despite everyone around us having some really intriguing looking plates of food...we could not potentially experience any of that for ourselves.  Why? Because full menu was not available after 10pm.  Are you kidding me? Center Strip in Las Vegas on a Saturday night?  As Guy would say, \"Shut the front door!\" No, you might as well, if you're going to do this in Las Vegas on a weekend.  Our bartenders apologized to us, said it was a \"new thing\" and all agreed it was an incredibly stupid idea.  So, we finished that one round of drinks and walked out to find a nice dinner at one of the many other options nearby, ALL of which were serving their full menu past 10pm.  Goodbye to Flavortown.",

    "text": "Someone asked me privately from YELP If I was picky with food because I used to cook for celebrity chefs? I'd like to say no because there are some food establishments that aren't considered 5 star that for a plate I'd slap my mama---but I am harder on establishments that consider themselves elite amongst Top Chefs.   A friend recommended this place to me and I decided to give it a chance. Normally I don't frequent celebrity chef establishments because having worked in this industry I know that the chef is NOT who is cooking the food. I was excited about going on the strip since I avoid it like EBOLA, so I think my expectations were too high.  We were given a seat on a very busy corner and our next best option was to be seated by this wall with a flat screen. We opted by the wall. While waiting for our food we stared at this wall feeling like inmates serving a prison sentence. Our server brought us some glasses of water and joked that we were about to enjoy the lovely minerals from Lake Mead. After one sip, I knew what he was talking about. YUCK! I couldn't get over the jumbo ice cubes and thought they were the most beautiful thing.   We started out with the triple T fries which were...OK. Only the very top of the fries contained that truffle \"goodness\" and it was so faint. Which means they probably didn't \"toss\" all of the ingredients together. They just piled and sprinkled it on top. Cooking 101. I love truffle oil and I barely got any, leaving me feel like I just ordered garlic parmesan fries. On the menu it says, \"Truffle, truffle, + more truffle.\" It was more like, \"Lies, lies, + more lies!\"  Not wanting to gorge myself silly I ordered Bruthas Badass Caesar salad and The Generals wings. My friend ordered some jumbo burger. Our food came and after one look I could tell that my bread on the plate was stale. Here's a little inside info for you guys. Croutons are usually made with DAY OLD bread to avoid cost and waste. There's nothing wrong with that, but after a day----YOU DON'T MAKE CROUTONS or KEEP the ones you made previously.....you just cut your losses and toss it. I knew right away that jumbo crouton was made more than a day in advance. It was so friggin' hard and you could tell by looking at it closely that it had started to get old because when you cook old ass bread it leaves a pattern that looks pulled. It's hard to explain without showing you closely, but maybe you can see it in my photos. The salad dressing was sooooo watery and thin, which was most likely caused by tossing the lettuce while wet. I don't even want to get into that.   The wings were hard as a brick! They were overcooked then glazed with this wierd Walmart Hoisin tasting sauce. Nothing had flavor. My friend didn't enjoy his burger either. It was cold. We didn't complain because I understood that it wasn't something that could be corrected. The food IS WHAT IT IS due to errors that need to be corrected by the Executive Chef, or Guy Fieri just really sucks. I'm gonna sound like an old timer, but back in my day a chef wasn't a chef until he/she spent over ten years training, spent years in Europe giving blood, sweat, and tears on the cooking line, and even then you were humble until you proved yourself leading a line. Too many people call themselves chefs when they haven't mastered the basics of flavor. Even I haven't mastered anything at this point since I left that world and discontinued my training--but I really was hard on this restaurant. Food can't just look pretty on a plate---it has to taste good too. I expected much more from a big name \"chef\".",

Over all I feel bad that this was an experience that I will never forget and Guy, you need not too work so hard if cold barbecue sandwiches represent your good name.

Wait staff and hostesses were polite and helpful.  Menu is perfect, easy to navigate, not a book of choices, just a select few of very good ones.  Started with the Vegas Fries, which were basically wedge french fries in some sort of batter that gave them a fantastic buffalo tender texture. Perfect blend of buffalo sauce and herbs and cooked to a fantastic crunchiness.  I really enjoyed it as an app, two of us finished the plate with no problem.  For dinner I had the Italian Cold Cut salad. Awesome to say the least.  It was a light salad tossed in a vinegar italian dressing. Great cuts of sausage found inside, along with olives, pepperoncini and other surprises. The best part of the dish though? Served in a bowl made of prosciutto and provolone (I believe it was provolone).  Fantastic, the perfect cross between filling and light.  Two days later we went back for breakfast.  I had the Maple bacon french toast, just as awesome as the dishes from the first trip!  Delicious (although just a touch overcooked) french toast, thick and crispy maple encrusted bacon, caramelized banana wedges. Outstanding.  To complete the dish, also included a watermelon gazpacho to cleanse the palate.  Overall very happy with the service and the food. I will most certainly be coming back on my next visit to Vegas!",

We tried the fondue dippers- pepperoni wrapped around pretzels- and I'm pretty sure it was cobbled together from store-bought ingredients, something most of us could make at home.  The Caesar salad had a massive crouton that couldn't be cut even with a steak knife.  The brisket was good, though, and the drinks were decent.   The food wasn't that great, but I dropped the review by a couple stars purely because they were switching to a special \"late night\" menu on a Saturday at 10pm in Vegas.  I can understand a limited menu after midnight (though even that seems early in that city), but 10pm is just bizarre, and it made the whole seating/ordering process an unnecessarily nerve-wracking game of beat-the-clock.",

Our main courses were the great burger and the cajan chicken sandwich. Both had layers of flavor. The beer was cold and the wait staff was fast & friendly. My only complaint would be the overly salted fries served on an awkward metal stand.",

I can't wait to go back and try the Cajun sandwich and the truffle fries.",

We decided to stay since we were already there, I was starving and it was 112 degrees outside.  Our waiter, Chris Anderson was seriously THE BEST WAITER I've EVER had!!! He was witty, extremely informative of the menu, very attentive and had wonderful recommendations. We ordered the amazingly delicious hand battered onion rings that came with a sriracha ketchup dip (soooooo good)! We also had french fries smothered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  Now let me say, I hate blue cheese but the fries, buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles all went together so well. Lastly, we order a bbq burger with all the toppings the bread literally melted in your mouth, it was phenomenal. I'm so glad we decided to stay the food was great, the atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding.  I've been recommending this place to anyone and everyone who will listen!!!",

Ordered seasoned fries (don't remember which ones-I think one was buffalo)-they were OK-started to rain and we were on the patio.  No one offered to assist us with another table.

After waiting for what seemed an enternity, are server decided to bring our food, which took forever. The flavoring and seasoning of the food was okay, not much to my liking and didn't even bring a smile to my face once!

Fries were ice cold, bun was dried out and the sauce had soaked deep into it making it impossible to hold. I give one star because they didn't charge us.

Ambient was nice and low key inside and outside seemed lively.  SERVICE: Sadly the night service needs to set different priorities. Greeter was chit chatting and even waved us to wait while she finished her places to party suggestion to the group she was talking to. The waiter was nice but a little slow and a little absent. Neither was too frustrating though.  FOOD: The fire wings were perfectly cooked all the way through. Not over cooked not over crispy, just right! The spicy fire test sneaks up on u. It's good but if ur eating only that it'll burn a bit. Don't over order them or share them. The ranch tasted too more like sour cream than ranch. The fries are delicious, they really stand out. They had a mac' n cheese burger that was good. Not too strong in the Mac n cheese flavor but maybe for the best.   I would go back and I would recommend it.",

Overall the burger was cooked perfectly, the meat was done \"smash\" style, which I like and it was tasty.  The bun was really good, and had all the right toppings.  It also came with fries which were also very good.  The service was a bit slow in my opinion, but the atmosphere was pretty cool being right on the strip.  We ate outside so we can listen to music and watch all the craziness going on outside.  Food is expensive as are most all places on the strip, but it was still worth it, and i think I would like to try some other menu options.",

We remembered that the trash can nachos looked amazing and were super stoked to try them as our full meal. When they got to the table they looked pretty good, but after eating a few bites we both started to talk about how they were rather bland and simple. The taste of fake cheese was overwhelming and not balanced at all with other flavors. We agreed that it was basically like eating $20 gas station nachos.  The other food we saw come out looked pretty good, but we fully regret our decision. Don't get the nachos.  Our food was NOT good, but I'm giving 2 stars because the service was efficient (especially for how crowded they were). The Bloody Mary and beers we had were also good.",

There were cheese, tomatoes, onions, and sour cream topping the nachos in layers.  One thing you'll need to be aware of is that the mix tends to stay near the middle of the stack.  It's best to use a fork to blend and pull the toppings out.  Can't say enough about how great these are.   Service was a little spotty but friendly.",

The food was average and nothing extra ordinary. We liked the nachos for its crispiness. Yes, I do have high expectations from Guy.   We were happy with our waitress and service.   We will come back in the future .",

    "text": "Guy Fieri's in Las Vegas is exactly as Guy's show is on the Food Network, big burgers and lots of fries. The interior is indicative of his style with the clipboard menu and the wood planks that hold the drinks menu. Our server, Brittany provided great service. The kitchen is an open design where you can see what all of the line cooks are doing inside.  For two, we ordered the Triple T Fries (truffles), the Bacon Mac N Cheese Burger, and the Triple B Burger. The Triple T Fries are very thin cut fries that come with micro-planed truffle shavings, gouda cheese and parsley sprinkled on top. The thin cut fries are very crispy, and have great texture. The gouda cheese gives the fries a nice cheesy taste without overwhelming the taste of the fries or the truffles. The truffle, just as importantly was not overwhelming as well, providing an extra layer of flavor with the earthy, mushroomy tones. The creamy white truffle dip really did just taste like sour cream. As the price would suggest, the Triple T Fries do come with a lot of fries. I would recommend sharing this with up to 4 people if everyone is having a burger as well.  The Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger is a charbroiled burger topped with a mac and cheese that is slightly better than average. Other toppings included crispy deep fried onion stings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The burger comes with what would be the equivalent of a medium McDonalds fries (more on this later). The tomato really did not add much to this burger and really could have been either left off or given another slice of. The burger patty alone was actually a little dry and could have been a bit moister. The Mac-N-Cheese was not supermelty as the menu would have you believe, but was tasty anyway. The donkey-sauce, I believe, is the bbq sauce at the bottom of the burger. The apple-wood bacon brought in salty and smoky flavors to the party and is always a great addition to a burger or mac-n-cheese. The brioche bun brought in some sweetness to balance all of the salty flavors in between. I wish there was a bit more pickle, but I just like pickles. Overall, this burger was good, but short of great or excellent.  The Triple B Burger is a charbroiled burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, with addition toppings of crisped onion strings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The Triple B Burger is also served on a brioche bun and this also helps balance out the flavors a little. The blue cheese was actually a little overwhelming on some parts of that burger, some areas of it had a ton of blue cheese and other areas had little to none. The burger did have some interesting spice flavor to it, but it was difficult to discern what those were among the blue cheese. This burger also had the same problem with the dryer burger patty as the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger. Overall, this burger was good as well, it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas of the burger.  The fries that come with the burger are crunchy just like the fries with the Triple T Fries, but there is a bit of variation, some are thicker cut home fries, mixed in with a few waffle fries, and the super thin cut fries as well. The larger fries are seasoned with a spicy Cajun type seasoning or spicy seasoned salt.  Overall, this was a good meal with solid flavors. I think that I can make a better Mac-N-Cheese with just three cheeses and have it actually be supermelty. The Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger suffers from not having that supermelty cheese as well as a slightly moister patty. The Triple B Burger has the same problem with the burger patty and needed a bit more attention to detail. Overall, the food was a solid 3/5 and the interior/service was an excellent concept for Guy's restaurant (4/5). In any other location, I would consider the price and knock this down one star for the price based on the offerings. However, in Vegas, it seems pretty average. Guy Fieri's gets a 3.5/5 with all things considered.",

I sat at the bar that was fairly empty, more open seats then occupied. I thought I was on my way to flavor town. What went wrong was simple service across the bar. I waited and waited and waited. I don't mind  waiting especially when tenders are busy but what I saw was oblivion. Even after I ordered, my bartender served walk ups two waters and then had a big swig of oj while chatting up coworkers. 10 minute's to take an order can happen but 10 minutes to not yet fill it is just plain ineptness especially when the rail is at 50%. And four people were behind the bar. I get it, service  in Vegas sucks, but I expected more here.",

We also got the chili fries, they were huge and split well between 4 people. The cocktails had a great flavor but for the bartender put very little alcohol in them. I am sure we will go bad again, hopefully get a better server, and we'll just order beer so we don't get ripped off on a $12 drink with no liquor lol",

I ordered the Motley Que: a pulled pork sandwich. I know Guy knows pulled pork! Unfortunately, it was extremely bland and not worth the $20 I paid for it. We also ordered the bacon mac n cheese burger. This was supposed to be award winning. When it came to our table it was lacking bacon and the extra added cheese sauce. It was literally mac n cheese on a very burnt hamburger patty. I had high expectations that were not met. I do not recommend this restaurant, unfortunately.",

At that price, my expectations were high that it would be worth it.  Well, Texas Whataburgers, and In-N-Out animal burgers are equal.  Actually, the animal burger is more flavorful.  My expectations were that the Fieri burger, would start mooooing, and bucking for the price.  Just didn't happen.  But, the service was good, but not worth the wait.  One thing, we have a fieri in Laughlin, won't have to try it out.  Hey, is In-N-Out Burger, Open?",

We landed late and it took for-ev-er to check in so it was close to midnight before we started our adventures.   As we walked around we saw guys was open and we thought why not.   The menu was limited but the wings and nachos we stupid delicious. The fireball whisky wings are the truth.   Stop 2: we had a quick lunch and I just got the pepperoni pretzels with some cheese sauce. Again deadly.   Stop 3: breakfast. I forget what I got but you can imagine it was again....delicious.   Bloody Mary's looked yummy. Burgers are yummy. Go now if you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "I admit it ... I'm a big Guy Fieri fan. I'll dispense with gushing over the celebrity chef, but suffice to say, Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar was high on my foodie to-do list. I have found that celebrity chef restaurants often fail to live up the hype of their larger than life owners. Not so here. It definitely delivered on the creativity, flavor and attitude of it's namesake chef.  My wife and I stopped in about 5pm on a Wednesday and was surprised to be seated immediately. As we were leaving, the line was already building, so I think you should generally expect a bit of a wait here.   Loved the atmosphere. Casual country with attitude. Our waiter made a splash with his enthusiasm right from the start, stating \"I want you to do me a favor. Close your eyes and pick anything on the menu. If you don't like it, I would be happy to eat it.\" Now there is an enthusiastic endorsement!  We started with some cocktails -- my wife had a Guido's Freaky Tiki which was a fun twist on her favorite Mai Tai cocktail. Passion fruit puree really made this drink by giving it some interesting texture. I'm a hardcore old fashioned man, so I had to try the \"not so old fashioned\" which featured basil-infused apple syrup. This was one of the best old fashioned cocktails I've ever had. Totally anchored the evening for me.   On to the food. While our waiter said he would be happy to eat anything we didn't like, the real service would have been to help with our leftovers because the portions are HUGE. My wife had the Motley Que sandwich, which turned out to be amazing. Piles and piles of delicious, sweet barbecue on a big pretzel hoagie bun. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the sauce was crazy good. Being a burger fan, I had to go with the unique and award-winning Bacon Mac-n-Cheese burger. Loved this burger! It was a wonderfully crispy smashed patty stacked with lettuce, tomato, crispy bacon and creamy Mac and cheese. Combined with the regular cheese on the burger, this was ooey gooey deliciousness. It was all captured in a delicious garlic-buttered brioche bun. Absolutely perfect. But you know what stood up these sandwiches? The fries. Each came with a basket of fries -- a fun mix of waffle fries, potato sticks, and crinkles. The seasoning on them was both sweet and savory. Much like Red Robin seasoning, I may have to find this to buy for home.   Total for cocktails and a couple sandwiches was about $80, which is a little on the pricey side but I found it to be worth it for the fun attitude and unique, delicious food we received along with the great service. Can't wait to return and try other items on Guy's fantastic menu.",

We waited for our bill . While she talked with two other server is standing in front of our table. When she was done talking she tossed the bill on our table and walked away. After following you on most of your food excursions going all the way to Las Vegas to enjoy your restaurant was the biggest disappointment I've ever had.

There seems to be a never-ending line around peak meal times (I heard a customer say that they waited 3 hours to get seated. Three. Hours.), so we delayed our lunch time and sauntered in around 2PM. No lines. 1 minute wait while they cleaned a table for us. No pain.  As soon as we sat down, I already knew what I wanted -- the bacon mac and cheese burger. One of my weaknesses is mac and cheese, so of course I had to have it. The burger is massive -- piled high with a patty, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and of course, the mac and cheese and bacon. Sadly, the patty was a bit thin and dry compared to other burgers I've had. Maybe I can ask for it to be medium rare next time... The flavor of everything else was good but not foodgasmic. I'm glad to have tried it, but I'm not sure I would drop $20 for it again.  I like that they give a variety of fries on the side -- skinny cut, thick cut, waffle cut... all perfectly seasoned with a side of ketchup.  Service is superb. Our server was extremely friendly and came around as much as he could to check on us.  As far as burgers go, though, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR still wins for now. Sorry, Guy.",

    "text": "Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar is a gastropub located inside the LINQ hotel.  This pub puts a spin in your classic American burger and fries joint. If you're familiar with the show, Diner's, Drive ins, and Dives, you will find a lot of resemblance from triple D into the restaurant such as the atmosphere, the decoration, and even the entree names on the menu.  To start things off, they have a lot of wines, mixed cocktails, and plenty of beers on tap. I suggest you try some of the cocktails they have. They also have a couple of appetizers such as lettuce wraps, spinach dip, and tacos.   For the entrees, their specialty revolves around their burgers, I suggest you try the original ringer burger, a burger with a friend onion ring inside. Another burger I would suggest is the mc n cheese burger. They also added steaks to their menu and they do have quite a few choices in cuts. I think what makes this place stand out is their Vegas style fries. A vegas style fries is basically 4-5 different cuts of French fries (straight, crinkled, wedges, waffle, and curly). I urge you to try it as it is delicious and different.  Overall, this would be my 2nd trip coming back and Guy Fieri did not disappoint. It could get busy at times so come prepared to do a little bit of waiting. The size of the restaurant inside itself is pretty small, but they do have outside seating available.",

Just a heads up that this place is always super busy so you might have to wait to get in. I came in on a weekday in the mid afternoon, even so, there was a 10 mins wait time.   At my visit, I ordered a Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger, which was with crispy Applewood bacon, 6 cheese Mac n Cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cheese and donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche bun..  I was particularly pleased with the spice on the burger. It was not overwhelmingly salty like most burgers I have had, this one was just perfect! The fries that came with had a variety of cuts (including crinkle cuts, curly fries and etc) and was perfectly seasoned. They were definitely some of the BEST fries I had ever had!   The food was a bit pricey I found (especially for a restaurant and bar type of ambient) but it was expected as it is on the strip, and you're also paying for the big name of the owner/chef.   Nevertheless, if you are in Vegas, you need to check this place out!",

The wait could be very long if not because my friend had the reward card.  Waited for 5 minutes for our waiter to come. He was sweet but take my menu away too quick before I am done learning (first time here ). Ordered the fireball wing (dry and not very tasty ), Cajun chicken sandwich (super super salty fries are old ) and wotun sashimi taco (sweet and good but very small portion ).$100 bill with $20 tip won't be back.",

A restaurant known for its burgers we figured we would be knocked off our seats for a burger that cost over 20 bucks.  We were mistaken.  The veggie burger was , for a lack of a better word, gross. The bacon, Mac n cheese burger....well we could have gone to Dennys for the same quality. The fries were great, but not worth spending 65 dollars on two burgers, fries, and a  soda. So disappointed.  sadly will question Mr. Fiery's opinion of other places based in the poor quality of his own establishment.",

Notice about 10 tables inside empty,Was told they where short staffed and they had nobody to serve those tables,Yet they have someone to help you outside in 90 degree weather (HUH)Waiter walks up and you can tell right away he also is not thrilled about working outside. Brings our soda's out which all where completely flat no carbonation at all.Maybe when you pay $4 bucks for a coke they remove it? Asked for new drinks..Same zero carbonation. (Walked into hotel gift shop and bought a soda) Was cheaper to.  Takes 45 mins for food to arrive, I ordered the french dip (No horseradish) It arrives with horseradish waiter proceeds to argue with me that they switched horseradish for some cream. Well you think you could ask me first if I was ok with that. I sent it back.I was so pissed I had to actually argue with him over this,Had my kids not been with me I would of got up and left.  Bread was good but the meat had to much smoke flavor. The fries even my kids would not eat.Its like the dip each fry in season salt.Wife and my Mom each ordered a sald. Same salad yet when brought out they where different one had half the ingredients the other one did.Burger was very good. Waiter stopped by 1 time.We asked for refills on soda and never got them.Guy I suggest you get to your place and fix your staffing problems.",

It's huge so I shared it with s friend.  The assortment of different types of fries were quite tasty.  We sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a table.

The pork sandwich had hunks of fat and I hated it, was very dissatisfied. I never had such a gross pork sandwich before and hope he gets rid of it on the menu. The outfits the girls wear as waitresses are a bit distracting and unprofessional, but it is Vegas. These were a little too trashy for me with all the girls pulling them down as they walked so it made it seem they were uncomfortable too. Not very acceptable Guy! I sell clothes for a living and own a store, there's other outfits women can wear that don't make them feel insecure and always needing to pulling them down to cover their rear. The chicken wings and their cocktails / drinks are really great. We went 3 times in the 6 days we were there. Very pleased with the burger too. So I overall rate it 4 stars.",

    "text": "Here I am back at Flavatown. I am a fan of Guy's, and his menu, but GFLV really didn't live up to what I think Guy would expect from a restaurant which bears his name.  Upon arrival, I sat at the bar and was tended to by \"Mike,\" who I would consider inept at best or else just plain rude. Either way, it was a start to a lackluster visit.   Caesars emailed me a coupon for a free beer which I tried to redeem. Even though the codes and terms were clearly on it, Mike had no clue, and made me wait over 15 minutes before I finally told him to just charge me for the beer as I was sick of waiting.  Next I ordered a 68 Cajun sandwich. I have enjoyed this at other locations, and know what to expect. Mike then demanded that I open a tab. I indicated that this would be all I wanted, but Mike refused to allow me to just pay for what I ordered. He claimed it was policy. I admittedly snarked back at this but begrudgingly capitulated. I would have just been annoyed if it wasn't for the fact that an attractive young lady sat next to me, ordered and he gave her the option of opening a tab or not...  Next up came my sandwich. I was heartbroken. The 68 is a chicken and andouille sandwich with onions peppers and celery in a butter/hot sauce served along with a melange of fries. Said fries tasted lukewarm as if sitting under a heatlamp for a while. The hoagie roll would not cut in half due to being rubbery. The celery was cut the long way making it hard to chew through. instead of the buttery sauce the sandwich was filled with straight hot sauce. And perhaps most offensive, the chicken tasted as if it were frozen in advance and microwaved, rubbery and tasteless.  I had high hopes for Guy's college hometown joint, but was totally disappointed. My advice, go to the White Castle across the street, sure they use frozen patties, but at least you know what to expect.",

Very flavorful, almost regular wings except the finishing note was cinnamon and almost sweet. My dad was about to order the Original, however \"The Sheriff\" said that he'll hook us up with a burger that's not on the menu.  I am NOT a burger person. However, I LOVED this burger. It had BBQ pork, pastrami, and a patty that was cooked 3-ways. All 3 of us agreed: It's the best damn burger we've ever had.  The Sheriff himself has that signature Guy Fieri personality: very outgoing, fun kind of guy that I want to hang out with and introduce to my momma.  Overall AMAZING experience. Worth every penny.",

The vibe is 5 star... you can feel Guy's touch and presence about...from the thirsty themed napkins to the way the silverware is laid out. Food has Guy's traditional 'pile it on thick and messy' flair, but that's why I give it 4/5. My eggs-over-easy, cheesy, guacamole covered tortilla chips got a bit soggy as I ate through them, but I KNEW that was going to happen going in! Right!?! And my husband's mac and cheese burger suffered a similar fate! That being said, I'd go back again in a heartbeat! Give it a go!",

Both times the service and the food was nothing more than outstanding. The portions are HUGE and you would assume the price tag for a portion of that size would be on the pricier side - but it's not.   You would expect quality taste...I mean it's Guy Fieri, right? Fortunately, for me, his restaurant and the quality of flavor meets that expectation. And at the end of it all, I was so stuffed that I didn't have any room for dessert (bummer).   I am looking forward to coming back here to try some new dishes on my next Vegas visit.   Now...here are some photos for your enjoyment.",

The side order of fries with three varieties is shareable. Everything is a large serving. We all enjoyed our food. My burger was good.  The only thing missing was Guy.",

We started with the sashimi won-tacos. These must have been our favorite thing we ate in Vegas. The raw tuna with the crispy shell were the perfect combo. We then moved on to the Original smash burger and mac and cheese burger. They were both huge and great. Also came with a side of fries (I really recommend they write this on the menu because we didn't think we were getting any and were thinking of ordering a separate side). The seasoning on the fries was so good. It had a spicy kick with a hint of sweetness. The cocktails are also great. They are so different that the waiter had to explain them all to me to get a sense of what I was ordering.   Our second trip, we had Nick L for lunch. He is the best server, so ask for him! He gave us great recommendations and was spot on. This time we tried the shrimp tacos and BBQ wings. Again, great. Prices are also unbeatable, especially on the strip. I highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, burgers or wings.",

You get a lot more than two people can eat with the nachos and the burger can be split for a couple.   We were seated quickly, but we didn't go at peak times. Consider that while dinning out during your stay. It can be to your advantage go hold off or go early.",

We were sat on the patio...it was a bit chilly but we sat right next to a propane heater and was fine. The ambiance was enhanced by sitting outside out night...it'd highly recommend  it if it's warm..the lights,  the sounds, FANTASIC.   The wait staff were very friendly and eye candy for those ladies that dig that...their shirts were super tight and they guys all had tattoo sleeves..so much so that I asked our waiter if it was a prerequisite lol. I only noticed one female waitress and she had on a football jersey.  I ordered the motley que sandwich and it was SUPERFANTASICAL! I'm a saucy kinda person so I ordered extra bbq sauce but it was juicy enough for you lite sauce peeps. I was too stuffed to order dessert but next time I go back...oh and trust me, I will...that may be on the agenda.   2 thumbs up Guy...2 thumbs up.",

    "text": "in vegas for qa conference and late so we shared a cheese burger with bacon. I have to say, the  concierge was right, it was once of the best burgers I have ever had.  It was juicy, they had garlic butter on the bun and the bacon was not over cooked.  We decided on the wise chocolate cake which looked great but was way too much alcohol taste and we did not like. waitress at first made no attempt to fix and look like she felt bad and took plate away.  We were shocked I thought ok this not going to be good, but then out of nowhere came the general manager Jason McIntosh and he was a Rock Star and came over and said sorry you did not enjoy the desert, let's fix that right now.  He suggested the fried ice cream and we excited to try it. Jason came back with sad look on his face as they were all out.  :(  Yea we were sad, but the smores dessert we ordered was amazing and more than we could eat.  So overall what could have been a very bad experience turned out to be a great night because of an alert waitress and excellent general manager Jason who understands customer service. It is not about the $20 desert, it is about the experience. Ok, it about the desert! ;) I will be telling about 100 at the conference today in our meeting go to go see Jason.    If you go here make sure to ask for Jason and tell him Jim sent you.",

I was stoked.  Ordered the bacon mac n cheese, proclaimed as the best burger in Vegas and some house wings.   ...This was one of the most bland burgers I've ever eaten. The meat was bland, the mac n cheese was bland, even the bacon was bland. How was this voted the best burger in Vegas? Low standards or people too drunk to actually know...? $21.50 for that. I was so disappointed. Drenched this burger in ranch so I could have some flavor. It came with a side of fries -wedges,waffles, and thick cuts. All tasted the same. All lukewarm.   The wings were so, so overcooked. Chewy, hard, and disgusting. No wonder they drenched it with so much sauce to try and cover up the taste/texture.   This was the most disappointing eatery throughout my weekend in Vegas. We were in Vegas for a tournament and a lot of the guys asked us for our opinion of this place. We recommended them other burger spots. Can't sabotage their palates.",

All we're very food and generous portions.  The service was good and food came out quickly.    The price was somewhat high but being in Vegas and the size of the portions justify price.  This is a celebrity chef joint worth recommending.  Hope it stays this way!",

    "text": "My veggie burger was fantastic and came exactly as ordered which I really, really appreciated since I had a number of odd requests such as Mac n cheese on a burger that doesn't normally come with it, no sauce, no onions or fried onions among a few other things. The Mac n cheese was good but I was imagining it to be very gooey and cheesy when in reality it was a bit more like baked mac n cheese (more solid than ooeygooey)  The fry trio was awesome. They were perfectly hot and salty though I wish I had a touch more ketchup. The margaritas were a bit small for $15 but is to be expected with the Vegas Strip I guess. My punch bowl drink was amazing and tasted just like I imagined it would so even though it was expensive I would certainly order it again! Overall I'd come back again!",

Food & Drinks: I ordered the fireball whiskey wings, not too spicy, a perfect combo between spicy and sweet! The lemon drop cocktail is perfect! Such a creeper, tasty yet powerful! I ordered the Tattoo Turkey Burger and as a person who doesn't eat beef or pork, I was in awe. The Burger is grilled on the outside and juicy and tender inside. Every bite is a new experience I must say! The fries are perfectly crispy. Fried Icream sundae is to DIE for.  Unclear how I made room for it but you MUST try it!  Service: The bartenders were extremely attentive and personable. They were awesome and offered us $5 shots we couldn't turn down!  This place needs 5 stars, go check it out!",

And, of course, it took forever for our food to come. And when it did, I ended up having some sort of aversion to how spicy/flavorful the chorizo in my burrito. Later in the trip I had my leftovers and there was no problem. It tasted pretty darn good reheated when I wasn't feeling gross. But I mostly ate my nachos and my boyfriends chicken fried steak and biscuits while I was there.   It was okay, he wasn't crazy about the biscuits. Too crunchy, and bland. I felt so much better after eating, but not because what we ate was especially amazing.  I also didn't feel like there was a really big selection on their menu, for brunch. But that seems to be kind of typical in most of the more famous chef's restaurants in Vegas.  We sat at the bar, the bartender was very nice, asking for a smile and all, but I really wasn't in the mood. Still A+ for him though.  I swiped some of their cool skull coasters to use at work.",

The fries were a hodge podge of shapes.   Ahi Won- tacos - Did not like at all. Too much fusion going on here, and it didn't balance right. It almost felt dessert like because the sweet soy/wasabi or whatever sauce was too sweet. And they put so much on it that it coated everything, making it feel heavy and thick. With something deep fried and involving sashimi, I wanted something a little more refreshing, and citrus based.  7 layer jack daniel chocolate cake - This was an actual legit cake. Could easily feed 6-8 people! I thought it was going to be a 7 layer slice, not an entire cake. When I opened up the box, I was shocked. Had a rich chocolate flavor, and a VERY strong alcohol flavor that made my throat and eyes burn. Haha, didn't know it was possible to have that reaction from alcohol in food.   The two bartenders were both so friendly. The girl was sweet, and when I mentioned a cold, asked if I wanted tea or anything. Not sure if it was free or not, but I was getting a to-go order, and might not have enough hands to carry any beverages with me. But the offer was unexpected and very nice. The guy was helpful, had a pleasant leisure attitude about him, but he took my order, and also offered me a water while waiting.   Lots of TVs here, so definitely has that sports bar vibe going on. Plenty of people opting to sit at the bar to eat, even if there was seating available.   Food was so-so, but I think the staff was great!",

If we got it again we would ask to omit the lettuce and other toppings and include only the burger with the mac-n-cheese.

Shared the Mac n cheese burger and I like what they do with their fries. There's a mix of different types of fries in a little tin. It's cute and brilliant. Always had that idea myself.   The burger was tasty and high quality. Mac was cheesy and the bacon was well done as well. Loved it.   Also got the trash can nachos. Omg those were huge as well can't believe these portions. You need about 5 people to eat that lol. The streak and sauces used tasted good and definitely fresh.   Lastly I left with the Jack Daniels chocolate cake. And. Needless to say it lasted me weeks. I even took two Tupperwares of it on the plane with me back home. Ifs good but I'd say it's best when heated up it makes the gooey layers mesh into the cake. I'm not a cake person so as it was served I didn't like it much but heated up a tad made all the difference.",

    "text": "My family and I were so excited to try Guy Fieri's Kitchen and Bar, after watching Diners, Drives and Dives all the time. We knew it would be good food and it was \"off the hook\"! The Prime Kobe Burger was amazing. My wife got the Old School Steak sandwich and as Guy would say, \"it was out of bounds\" too. Tip...order a few sides of their Donkey Sauce, it is great on the burgers, sandwiches and fries. The atmosphere is cool, the place was packed on Saturday night and we left very full. For our Flavortown Finale, we ordered The Triple-Double Mint Pie. It was in my top 3 desserts I have ever had. Check out the picture of it and you will see what I mean. Some reviews mention being overpriced, but I thought for the strip and being such a big name, it wasn't too bad. We didn't get drinks this time, but with 2 meals and a dessert, we were right around $60 dollars. The only negative for me, was the service was unorganized and very slow. We put our name in and were told we would get a text. We got a text about 30/35 minutes later, that our table was ready. Then we stood at the front hostess table for another 10 minutes, with 2/3 other groups, that also got text messages. I thought the whole check-in/table process, wasn't great, especially on the strip. Then once we were seated, we waited another 10 minutes before we even got our drinks (waters) ordered. On a positive note, our waitress was awesome and super nice.",

When it said add a salad or side caesar salad \"for 5\" i'm thinking it's good enough for 5 people.  What they mean it's \"for $5\".  Just drop \"for\".  The rest of the menu doesn't have \"for\" when they specify the price.    I tried the ribs and the brisket.  I preferred the ribs.  Meat was tender and I love the BBQ sauce.  The brisket was ok. The cornbread that came with the ribs was amazing!  I love cornbread.  Food was really good and way better than going to some crappy buffet.  We wanted to come back other times but the wait was long.  It's a popular place.  Conveniently located in the Linq.",

    "text": "I swear, it was like foreshadowing when I walked up to the front and there was no wait to be seated.  The restaurant was very empty.  This should've been my cue to step back out of the restaurant and eat elsewhere, but I really wanted to give Guy Fieri's restaurant in Vegas a chance.  I was asked if I wanted to be seated at the bar or a table.  I decided on the bar since I didn't want to take up a whole table when I was eating alone.      The girl behind the bar was knowledgeable when it came to what the cooks were capable of doing and what dishes did and did not contain gluten.  At first, I wanted to try The Original Ringer Burger and substitute the bun with gluten free buns for an extra cost.  However, I was told that Guy's signature Bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce contained gluten.  She said I could leave the sauce out.  I said that I really wanted to try Fieri's food and that taking out the BBQ sauce would alter the burger too much.  I then decided on the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger which looked fairly safe based on the ingredients mentioned in the menu.  This was when I was told by the bartender that the turkey patty is made with breading throughout.  She then recommended the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger which threw me off a little because Mac-N-Cheese is straight up all gluten!  I finally just decided on the Mayor Of Flavortown Burger since that one would be the easiest to alter.  The Mayor Of Flavortown Burger ($20.50) came with USDA choice ground beef patty, seasoned pastrami, Swiss cheese, caraway seed slaw, dill pickles, sliced tomatoes, onion straws, Dijon mustard, and the bun which I substituted with gluten free buns.  All of the burgers come with quad fries.    Just an FYI for the gluten sensitive folks out there, this joint does offer gluten free buns, but there is a very high chance of cross contamination in the kitchen since the fryer is used for both gluten and gluten-free foods.  The staff is very open and honest about this.  Ok, back to the food.  When the food came out, the burger was humongous and looked just like something that Guy Fieri would eat that would induce a myocardial infarction.  The burger screamed Guy Fieri and it looked pretty good actually presentation wise.  The main problem was when I bit into it and the burger had no flavor and was super dry!  What the hell?!?  I was shocked especially since the burger was greasy.  I figured it was at least somewhat moist on the inside.  Nope!  The burger in general was nothing special either.  It was very disappointing since I was super hungry.  The fries tasted like your everyday fries, nothing special.  Guy Fieri seriously needs to continue doing what he does best and that is eating other people's food.  He needs to stay out of the kitchen as a chef because his food sucks!  I only gave two stars just because the bartender was somewhat knowledgeable about gluten free options at the restaurant, and she provided average customer service.  Other than that, the food is way overpriced for being not good and you have way better food options out on the strip!  Don't be dumb like me and spend $30 (fees for alteration + tip) on a shitty Burger.  In-N-Out is way better and cheaper.",

This quick rundown is to justify the grading criteria: Atmosphere: 3/5 (music too loud) Food: 3/5 (everything was DELICIOUS!! but many things forgotten throughout meals)  wooohoo! Finally had the chance to try one of guy Fieri's restaurants!! He is one of my favorite chefs (Gordon Ramsay, Mario Battali, Giada DeLarentis in that list) and when in Vegas, Gordon's restaurant was...well certain issues prevented us from going so i was still happy getting to Guy's!  First off, the place was packed!! Saturday night and 20-30 people waiting outside!  My parents waited while I played my first game of blackjack (3 straight blackjacks ;) We came in to find them seated on the outdoor patio and immediately: the music was way.too.damn.loud.!!! The type of music was no issue for me, personally . . . BUT the fact it was so loud + casino sounds + packed restaurant volume + Vegas strip sounds=no good at all!!! Then our server was just...wack! My girlfriend and I sit down and immediately he comes over asking if we are ready to order . .. uhm chill!   anyways, we went through the menu and this is how everyone ordered: Greek Salad: i did not try it but mom liked it, unfortunately they forgot the hummus ...  fireball whiskey wings: oh my god!! These were delicious!! my girlfriend ordered these and hot damn!! they were not that spicy, but had a great kick and a whole lotta flavor!! simple, delicious and amazingly Guy-oriented!   Motley Que Sandwich: my dad and I ordered and split this as well as the Vegas Fries (next item) the pulled pork was UH-MAZE-ING!! delicious, tender, juicy, a whole lotta pork on the which!! the bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was just the right amount of sweet and tangy, and was perfect with the pork; i am  not sure what the donkey sauce is but i could tell there was another sharp flavor; the cheddar was thick and blended well with the whole sandwich! unfortunately, i just realized this sandwich was missing the onion straws and slaw . . . :(  and lastly the Vegas Fries! Simply waffle fries tossed in buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese and a side of blue cheese+wasabi dressing! these were perfect!! the fries were still crispy since they were not \"soaking\" in the sauce just coated; the side sauce was delicious! (also a shot of buffalo sauce) and overall very great fries!  so, as mentioned at the top, I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to give this place a 4/5...BUT...due to the crazy loud music, lacking server, and forgotten items throughout the dishes, 3/5 is the best I could do :( BUT also, I would love to return :)",

I got the lettuce chicken wraps and my friend ordered the turkey burger we both took one bite and fell in love the food is made with so much love and well seasoned . The turkey burger was not dry which is really hard to come by. For dessert we had the fried ice cream sundae and it just topped the meal of wonderfully .

The nachos had good flavor but the pulled pork was not fresh it was like the ends or was cooked several days ago. Didn't feel it was anywhere near with the price or the quality of the brand.",

We took a group of 11 to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday and all of us where very disappointed, the only reason I'm giving this review two stars is because our server was awesome, even though he was overwhelmed due what seemed to be a combination of the restaurant being understaffed and the place being slammed on a Saturday night. All the food was cold, the meat had good flavor but the beef and the pork was VERY dry and chewy. The prices where high for the quality of the food served, I don't have an issue paying a premium for a good bite but this was not that at all and we just all felt really let down. Maybe we just set the expectation to high.",

We started off with the Dragon's Breath Chile Cheese Fries and after seeing them started looking for people to help us eat them.  They don't skimp.  The flavors that came through were amazing.  Two different customers asked us what we had and they both ordered them.  These are a must try, no ifs ands or buts.  Who would put macaroni & cheese on a burger?  Sounded like a bad idea, but I had to try it and man! that's a heck of a burger!  First, it's huge so you might want to consider splitting it.  The flavors are fantastic with the different cheeses and bacon coming together with the donkey sauce and garlic.  This is all of Guy's adjectives rolled together.  After striking out on several other places in Vegas, it was great to finally have excellent food and nothing to complain about.",

I don't know what the cook did to the TT Fries, as the truffles and Gouda cheese all ended up at the bottom of the dish. Our waitress said they usually toss and mix w/fries, but I guess they weren't in the mood today. My loss.  Guy Fieri's restaurant on the Strip at the Link is mediocre at best.  I have had much better food at other places in town.  Sorry Guy about the review, but I will still watch Triple D.  Maybe you should stop back from time to time and check in with your chefs.

It was cooked incredibly well. The meat just seemed to be really high quality. The burger also came with fries which were delicious. There were all different types of fries. Waffle fries, crinkle cut fries, and shoelace fries. They had this amazing seasoning that was a little spicy, sweet, and salty all at the same time. I walked into this Resturant with 4 other people at 11am and they sat us right away. My experience here was perfect. There was not one negative thing the highlight. Nice job GuyFiore!",

I ordered the trash can nachos and they literally tasted like they came out of the trash can.  They use Velvetta cheese for nachos can you imagine?  I paid $47 for a sweet tea vodka drink and trash can  nachos and the nachos were so bad I literally left three quarters of them on the plate. On a positive note Jackie was our server and she was absolutely delightful.  Save your money go elsewhere.",

It took a few minutes for our server to get us our drinks.  It also took a while for the order to be place.  Then it also took awhile for our large party to get our food.  When we did though the food and burgers were delicious.  We all tried different sandwiches.  The bacon Mac n cheese burger was amazing.  It took me to flavor town and back. Besides the lengthy wait, average service, and  expensive food.  The food tasted great and the place was modern and cool.  Awesome outdoor patio.  Expected a little more for who's place it was.  Every restaurant in Vegas is owned by a celebrity.   Wish I could say better things besides Burgers were amazing.",

As Jeff mentioned, he was confronted by securing when he came out of the restroom in the Linq casino just outside the restaurant.  They not only wanted him to leave the restaurant but the whole Linq Casino property.  Security told me that he was subject to arrest if he did not leave.  This could have, and should have been handled in a much more professional manner.  The GM could have easily came out and shared his concerns with him, whatever they were.  If they did not want people taking pictures of him, they could have politely asked them not to.  For some reason, the GM found it necessary to call security instead!  The GM wouldn't even come out to deal with the situation he caused.  This is a perfect example of poor management skills and bad for the restaurant's image.  The funny thing is this all went down after we finished our meal and were ready to pay and leave.  They got their money and insured a big fan and everyone he knows will never step foot in their restaurant again.  Everyone loses on this poorly handled situation.  Congratulations.",

The chili bowl was delicious, a giant piece of cornbread layered with chili and a dollop of cremated on top. It was exactly how I like my chili, a one to one ratio of corn bread to chili.  The triple t fried came stacked sky high. Skinny skinny fries with a delicious truffle sauce on the side. So good, felt like bowl never ended!",

The staff was super attentive; always refilling water and coffee, and checking that we were doing well.   We sat outside to eat, but also at the bar for a moment while we waited for our table. The only downside is that the bar really reeks... smelled dirty and like it hadn't had a good washing in ages, but we didn't sit there for too long (thankfully.. really would have ruined our eating experience otherwise).   The food. Man oh man. I had the benedict and my husband had the chilaquiles. Exquisite!! Both had such a nice presentation too. My Benedict had such yummy chili; just a little spicy but then the sour cream around the plate mellowed it out. The chilaquiles portion was pretty big, and the meat was tender and delicious! Such a great mix of flavours.   We also saw a few plates of french toast going by that looked HUGE and delish. We were also intrigued by their Bloody Mary's, which you can \"build\", including selecting your liquor of choice and adding all kinds of fun garnishes and snacks to them.   I highly recommend this place for breakfast!",

    "text": "First time there tonight. Went about 7 PM. Said it would be a 45 minute wait for two people. We agreed, as the food looked yummy.  When we got seated we were lucky enough to score table outside. Could hear the band from the local music. It was nice. Ordered some wings barbecue I think. Also ordered the American ribs. Food arrived in a timely manner. Also ordered sodas. When the food arrives, it looked amazing. You could smell the barbecue sauce and it was played it properly. Portions were ample and we devoured almost all of it. Besides for the ribs or mac & cheese. Good. Smaller size for a side dish, but still good. The chicken wings came with an array of vegetables to dip into the blue cheese dressing. Wings had a slight Tingley and spicy flavor, but not overpowering. Ribs had a very tangy barbecue sauce that was on the sweeter side. Nice buck on the ribs, but I did notice that they had it removed the membrane before cooking. I know that's a personal choice for chefs. So I thought it was fine.  server was very sweet and helpful. Great demeanor and seemed like she was a pro at what she did.  Downsides? We were not offered anything to clean up our hands at the end of dinner. We had finger food. It would've been a nice touch. Other comment? Four dollars per soft drink. Free refills, but still? Expensive I think. Even for Vegas.  Also didn't like the uniforms that the servers were. They had a country vibe, which doesn't go with the restaurant. Boyfriend suggested using dickies work shirts and dickeys pants for men and dickies work shirt and denim skirts for the girls. I think that would look much better. It goes more along with the vibe of the creator of the restaurant. All in all, it's a must go to if you like good food how do you food and lots of food.",

    "text": "Our annual visit to the Bellagio Conservatory Christmas exhibit provided an opportunity to experience Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen.  At lunch the place was doing a brisk business. Table wait time was estimated at 20 minutes but was actually 15. Once seated our server Ed welcomed us and immediately took our drink order. Wait time for food was about what you would expect when the kitchen is slammed.  We ordered the Motley Que pulled pork sandwich and requested the Caesar salad in place of the fries and the Original Burger without the bun. The burger comes with fries. Both lunch items are large size orders that could be shared by two.  The pulled pork sandwich was pilled high with shredded and chunks of meat. A heaping portion of slaw, bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce on a pretzel bun completed the sandwich. The meat was tender with just right amount of smoke made one tasty sandwich. The whole dill pickle was crisp and tangy, one of the best that I have tasted. I am glad the sandwich was cut in half which made it manageable to hold. The Original Burger was juicy even though it was cooked as ordered well done. The order of fries were a combination of waffle,shoestring and crinkle cut. The fries were crisp outside soft inside and grease less. Because there are many more restaurants to experience up and down the strip it will probably be a long time for a return visit.",

Way more than anyone needs to eat. You will be leaving full and happy. The flavors are also spectacular.   The first morning I got the Bloody Mary. I went ahead and picked my own five garnishes. The mix was so, so good. One of the best I've ever had. You also get to pick how spicy it is. The garnishes range from proteins to veggies, you have lots of choices. For food I got Carne Asada Chilaquiles. I couldn't even begin to tell you what this is except for it was great to look at and even better to taste. I loved it! I could only eat half, though, because it filled me up fast.   When I went back, I got the Dragon's Breath Chili Cornbread Benedict. This was really good, too. Just a little bit of spice. It was very different. The cornbread was out of this world. Very moist and sweet. I enjoyed it. However, I'd pick the Chilaquiles over the Benedict.   My cousin got Guy's Big Bite Burrito, both times, and could only eat one half of it each time. This burrito is massive. And it was packed with flavor and goodness. The best part about her meal, though, was the guacamole. I love guac, I make it at home all the time. But when I say it was the best I've ever had? I mean it. The flavors are ridiculously good. You can literally taste each ingredient that's put in it. We both loved it and she doesn't even like guacamole!  I do, however, give this place four instead of five stars because the service wasn't as great as the food was. The first time, our service was dull and a bit slow. Not very friendly. The second time, extremely friendly and personable but our order wasn't put in and we had to wait awhile. The waiter was genuinely apologetic and accountable for it, which I thought was really great of him, though. But the service was not consistent, unfortunately.   All in all, if you're visiting Vegas, this place is a MUST GO TO! I'm very satisfied!",

    "text": "Welcome to (insert own adjective for mediocre)Town! I know... you think I'm being a jerk, but if you're selling flavor... people are gonna expect a lot of it! I tend to be mostly unbiased, and after having read the NY Times' review of Guy Fieri's Times Square restaurant, I kept my expectations realistic and thought of it more as FlavorHouse instead of FlavorTown.   This place is overhyped on the flavor thing... it's comparable to Chili's with food quality that is partially better.   Atmosphere 5/5- Cute place with a farm-to-table type of look, and the waitresses have great outfits. Hostess stand has massive bottleneck entry. Note: no bathroom inside, but there is just a few steps down around the corner in the Linq.  Service 3.5/5- Nothing memorable, whether good or bad.  Burgers 3/5- Dryyyyyy burgers. But damn! Great buns here. Slightly sweet in flavor. If nothing else, Guy has great buns... Never thought those words would come outta my mouth. Portions are substantial and come with fries. $17-20  Caesar salad 4/5- They hollow out a huge, dry crouton for a massive Caesar salad. The dressing is homemade and tastes nice. If croutons were girls in a Vegas club, they'd be a 23 year old in a black dress limping in heels... in other words, not memorable or particularly sexy. $15   Brunch here looked appealing and in large portions. I would be hard pressed to come here instead of go to Hash House a Go Go for breakfast/brunch, though.  For strip food pricing, I would say it's good, not great. Typical bar food done decently with a celebrity stamp on it... It's consolidated its punch to a FlavorHouse, not FlavorTown :)",

    "text": "My entire trip wanted to go here, not because I'm some Guy Fieri fan or anything like that, but because I wanted that bacon mac and cheese burger I saw on TV before I came to Vegas. I came. I saw. I conquered.  The restaurant has a cool vibe to it. Kind of has a man cave type of feel to it. It's got a foosball table in the front and of course there is some Food Network playing while you eat.  I was fortunate enough to get a table without a wait, sat down to review the menu, even though I knew exactly what I wanted and waited.   My server was nice but not exactly in a hurry. I could have brewed my own iced tea in the time it took her to bring me a glass.  The busboy who was there filling water glasses were exceptional. If not for him, most of us would be dehydrated.  Two things:  1. The bathroom isn't in the restaurant, it's in the casino. 2. Get a players card because you eat here. It'll save you a dollar per item.  The burger. Guys, this burger was amazing. Totally worth the wait. Mac and cheese and bacon-y goodness. The burger was cooked so well. Nice and juicy, but not too bloody. They get a little skimpy on the fries, but you're really so focused on the burger that it kind of doesn't matter.  I would definitely- definitely recommended to that burger. I will take the meh service to have that burger again.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here during the busy lunch hours so we had to wait about 45 minutes. We've watched Guy Fieri's shows and had so many people from Chicago recommend we go here and have his amazing burgers.  The advice was right, because the burgers we had were one of a kind without a doubt. They were cooked/grilled to perfection, and the toppings were all such a strange, weird combination although they fit perfectly together to make a taste unlike one I've ever had before.  Our server was the low point of the meal. I can't recall his name, although I wish I did. We waited for 15 minutes for him to come to our table, and when he did he was very chippery and happy, and I liked that. I requested a plain turkey burger, something he didn't seem to comprehend. I guess not all restaurants use the same lingo for food? I don't know. He told me to \"speak up, help me out here, what do you want, what do you not want?\" I just looked at him, and said \"a PLAIN turkey burger, meaning NOTHING but the meat and patty.\" He told me that was impossible. Huh? The turkey burger was really the only burger that caught my eye, and I really did not like all the toppings on it - I don't eat bacon and I can't eat onions (from the jam). Regardless, he made me think I was speaking a foreign language and told me he'd see what he could do. I really thought I wasn't going to eat that day, lol.",

My husband had the ribs and said they were great and would go back and get them - which is the only reason I give this place 2 stars. I had a hamburger and man it was hammered! Black burnt edges and way over cooked. The bacon on it was burnt as well. The mixed fries were meh...about the same as getting the good frozen ones and baking at home. It also took a long time to get a table although it didn't look crazy busy. We sat out outside and it was a good people watching spot.",

It is a little different but goos.. For entrees , we ordered chicken Alfredo, veggie burger, bacon Mac and cheese burger, turkey burger, hawaiian-bbq sandwich, lobster tacos. Good things first - My husband doesn't eat bacon, but when he tried this he said that his entree bacon Mac and cheese burger is too good. Veggie burger is not out of the world. But it is good. ( We ate that quality and probably better quality at other places in California). I must mention their fries are very delicious. But once they are cold ( which they will soon be in December weather), they don't taste good. If you are a group, replace some of the fries with salad. Chicken Alfredo also tasted good. The portions are good. Now the negative ones - lobster tacos are bland and the wings starter is tough. We shared the starter, but they didn't offer small plates ( may be it's the way here). It is a casual dinning restaurant. Nothing fancy. Some dishes are good. Some are sub par.  Overall I felt it is a good restaurant but not a must try ( excluding the bacon Mac and cheese burger). A bit on the side of pricey for the casual dinning , casual serving, casual ambience it offers. I recommend to try once. You can decide if to visit again or not. I won't.",

The pulled pork was excellent, but the slaw is more mayo based (I like vinegar).  The turkey burger had great flavor, but a spicier sauce would be nice.  I r commend adding donkey sauce.",

We ordered drinks and he brought one but forgot mine. We ordered burgers. I told him about my dairy issue and said no cheese, milk, sour cream etc but butter is fine and no white potatoes. Sadly they had no yam fries so I asked for a salad and added bacon to my burger.  Our food arrives and hubby's bacon Mac n cheese burger looks fantastic. I had a Kobe beef burger that arrived with no bun so I flag him down. He comes over to say oh, the bun is made with milk so the kitchen put your meat inside iceberg lettuce!  So you couldn't tell me that beforehand so I could change my order? It was presumptuous to just put my $25 burger on iceberg lettuce, charge me $3 for salad which was romaine with cucumbers then $5. For 2 tiny slices of bacon. I really wanted to lodge a complaint but was hungry,  on vacation and didn't want hubby to wait for me. Even the table next to us asked what I was eating! I was sorely disappointed. The burger was yummy but in general, this was by far the most disappointing meal in Vegas. Most places are very good about people with allergies or restrictions but this place was definitely not good for that.  We still tipped 15% but definitely will not return. There's a ton of good restos who even have allergies notes they attach to your order and also on your plate to ensure there's no mistakes.",

I feel like they are so over rated and over priced it's almost a waste of time and money.

The signature dish Guy himself would drive for isn't really clear and it didn't taste amazing. Fieri's kitchen is a different feel. A more commercial maybe not commercial sounds a bit harsh less mom and pop / homely then the restaurants he recommends. The type that want to stuff your face with really good food and take pride that there were no leftovers as demonstrated by your busting gut.   It's a different feel then what's expected and yeah the burgers are great and we had some tasty fries but nothing out of the ordinary.   So if you watch Triple D don't expect this place to be out of the world original. Its not. It's familiar food and it's open late.... limited late evening menu btw",

I had the chicken sandwich with salad.  Sandwich was tasty, but I was not thrilled with the heart of romaine salad.  To the credit of the manager he brought me a sample of fries after I voiced my opinion.  Fries were decent.  My wife had the baja bowl with steak and loved it.  Service was excellent and we left satisfied.  I probably won't be back, but don't let that dissuade you from giving it a try.",

Trash can nachos were on that list! The nachos serv 2 people and come with a good amount of cheese, steak, bbq, pico, and onions to fill you up. I was very pleased with how much topping it had due some places not giving enough and now you have a dry tortilla. $20 well spent! The wait was not long but we did go during brunch so I'm sure it can get worse.",

Search the country for the local folks using only fresh ingredients to cook up scratch made dishes that everyone in town loves.  So, with that said, how exactly did Guy arrive at the decision to open this Vegas dump inside a crap hotel and use FROZEN ingredients exclusively? I mean dude, brah, come on! Do you think they'll steal your bright yellow Lambo again if you use some fresh potatoes to make hash brown-tots? Or they'll cancel that GGG show if you use some fresh chicken apple sausage links?  I didn't really wanna eat here but Hash Hash a Go Go hd an hour wait and starvation was beginning to set in so this was the best option in the moment.   I'd probably revisit this place before I'd head back to Bacchanal buffet (go read that review folks) but I'm confident you've taken $65 from me for the last time.",

We ate on a Saturday around 5PM, and we only waited 15 minutes for a group of 4. We were seated, the overall restaurant was nice and had a cool vibe. We ordered and waited maybe 15 minutes for food. We ordered a side of onion rings because we usually love onion rings, but this is not the place to get them! They weren't anything special. Burgers were delicious and well presented, but it just wasn't worth the price or hype. A good place to go to experience it once and take some family, but didn't leave me amazed or wanting to recommend it.",

Drinks down on the carbonation , opted for a water after 2 attempts of flat soda. Good raves here, must visit if you enjoy Guy Fieri, again location is prime, staff pleasant , cleanliness, hustle and bustle. Great being in Vegas after a hearty meal you can walk it off on the strip! I would recommend the opportunity to visit if in Las Vegas, hearty classic gourmet hamburgers, appetizers incredible!!!",

The Ribs were pretty good, but again didn't stand out compared to Ribs anywhere else.  I like my Ribs when the BBQ Sauce kind of carmelizes on them.  These were like they just added the sauce at the very end of the cooking process.  My Dad's Traeger Ribs are better- when he doesn't over cook them.  I'm glad we tried this place.  It is pretty much what I thought it would be.  Kind of expensive for what you get, but that is to be expected at a Celebrity restaurant in Las Vegas.  Service was good.  I would give this place 3.5 stars if that was an option.",

    "text": "Service - some good, some awful  Food - Ok, nothing great  I sat at the bar for lunch, which was a little more than half full.  Unfortunately there was only one bar tender working, and she was having to move very fast to try to keep up with everything going on.    I ordered an appetizer and a sandwich - after about 15 minutes the sandwich arrived, but no appetizer.  The runner called over the bar tender, and they offered to take the sandwich back and keep it warm until I was ready for it - I said no, I would take the sandwich and they should take the appetizer off the bill.  After I was done with the sandwich and fries, waiting for check, the appetizer came out, and tried to get me to take it to go.  I was out for the day, and I wasn't going to leave the food in the car on a 100 degree day to spoil.  The cajun sandwich was tasty, but greasy and too messy - plan on having several pieces falling out of the sandwich (and chances are down your shirt)  was a disappointment to say the least",

    "text": "Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar is amazing when it gets it right and overwhelmingly off putting when they misstep.  Some of the details are immaculate: large square ice cubes that reflect the boldness of the atmosphere, custom napkins and silverware, a watermelon gazpacho shot advertised to cleanse your palette that delivers and refreshes.  With such care put in, why are the home fries from a frozen bag mix? Why does the waitstaff act inconvenienced at having to work the morning shift and need to be requested to serve your coffee before your order arrives?  Perhaps the hit and miss attitude is reflective of counting on the clientele to be hung over.  And, it is great hang over food. The chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy was an event in my mouth. I've never had chicken fried bacon and it elevates the dish. I had the equivalent biscuits and gravy at Hash House A Go-Go earlier this week and Guy Fieri's knocks it out of the park.   My partner's basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, and home fries was okay. The biscuit was delicious and the apple chicken sausage was delightful, but overall I would pass on this.   Come not expecting a culinary experience and leave with a full, happy stomach.",

We ordered wings and they were dry and extremely salty. We ordered his original ringer hamburger and a vegetarian  burger. Not impressed at all. The bun was dry. The coleslaw in the burger overpowered the taste of the patty.   The fries as side were nothing great too. There was nothing about the food that could ever  make us go back to his restaurant.  Considering he is from Vegas and runs such successful shows  on TV , his own food needs lot of work and improvement. Basic food like wings and burger...who gets it wrong?  This place is way too overpriced for the dry tasteless food we got to eat last night. It is off our list.",

    "text": "First, while $$ may mean entrees in the 10-30 range,  21 bucks for a hamburger and side salad puts it in the $$$ range.  That is EXPENSIVE for a hamburger.  The food here is HEAVY  and GREASY.  The platters look huge when the server brings them. I had the \"Mayor of Flavortown\" burger.  It  had pastrami on it. It also had coleslaw and some sort of deep fried onion and somewhere down at the bottom an overcooked beef patty. They allow the grease from the patty to soak into the bottom bun, yuk, instead of properly draining the burger.   The menu said swiss cheese also, but if it was in that gelatinous mess, it had no flavor.   These are not hamburgers, these are some monster creation, flavorless concoctions of garbage, with a garnish of overcooked beef and a grease filled bun.  When I have a burger, I want to taste the beef.  Sorry to have to write this I was expecting better.  I asked for Balsamic Vinegar and oil for the salad.  They brought them mixed together so it was impossible to get the mix of oil and vinegar that I liked.  Also, if they paid a dollar a gallon for that vinegar, they overpaid.  It was HARSH.  On the plus side, the napkins were great. the waitress was very pleasant, the \"food\" came out quickly.",

I glanced at the menu and saw that they had something for everybody in my group, so I picked that for our lunch destination. I'm vegan, so I was delighted to see that they had a veggie burger. I avidly LOVE Guy and was so excited to taste his food. The atmosphere was charming, and the waitresses were adorable. We were promptly seated and the service was quick.   I ordered the veggie burger, with no cheese, mayo, etc. so, the waitress caught on to the fact that I don't eat animal products. She then told me that the veggie patty has egg and cheese in it!:( she felt really bad, but I assured her that it wasn't her fault. So there I was, the person who chose the restaurant, eating a small side salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing. So sad. The rest of my party totally enjoyed their food, but I was so bummed that there weren't any vegan options! I would LOVE to see a vegan burger here in the future, especially during the year 2016 where people are beginning to wake up to the truth about animal agriculture. Guy, please make a vegan option or two!",

Our waitress was prompt with a greeting and to take our drink orders. She was a very good server and provided anything we needed. My husband ordered the ribs that came with fries and i got wings. The food came out fast. He said the ribs were very good, just not the best he ever ate. The wings were small, like wing-dings. They were not served with any sides, just wings. The bbq sauce was very good, but again, not the best I ever had. The meal was over $60.00, we didn't have any alcohol, just pop and ice tea.  Overall it was a good meal but one we could have got at any chain restaurant for much less. We probably will not visit again.",

I'm not sure how many locations they have but when I travel this is a must visit on my trips.   We start off with the Vegas fries, what a great concept and it was served with a Wasbi- Blue Cheese dressing first time I ever had that.  I had the Big Dipper a roast beef sandwich and again a great item to order.   For dessert we split the 7 layer chocolate cake and a glass of milk, o yeah my wife loved her Turkey Picnic Sandwich as well.  No Guy siting but it is Black Friday so maybe he's out shopping.",

I had it last year and it was awesome, but couldn't remember whether it was beef or pork, only that it was \"pulled\" or shredded. The description on the menu said it was \"pulled pork.\" It arrived and the cheese was in chunks and appeared it hadn't had time to fully melt. The meat was \"diced\" rather than pulled and was black and hard, like it was old and recycled. And the chips tasted stale. When I brought it to the server's attention, he kindly offered to replace it with a new one. New one was much the same. This time, I showed the server the dark, diced meat and asked if it's supposed to be like that, not pulled as described on the menu and he said no. He recommended we order something else as replacement would most likely be same. It was quite disappointing especially when I was very excited to share it with my sister. The rest of the food was good. It is pricey, but that's to be expected when you're on the strip in Vegas dining at a \"branded\" establishment.",

LUckily for us, this place was known for that and we did really love the food.   It was now lunch time and we decided to bear the wonderful 90 degree sunny desert heat from Belllagio. We walked into the restaurant and was seated right away at the booth.   This visit, our server lady stopped by within 15 minutes and got our drink order. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos again and they were amazing.   I ordered the Prime Time Burger and my wife got the Mac n Cheese burger again. Both did arrive in a reasonable amount of food.

They were so soggy and had barely any cheese. The burger was okay...nothing special. The ice cream was good, but you can't screw that up. We did find a small piece of plastic in our ice cream, it looked like saran wrap. Maybe that's what the skull was wrapped in? We brought it to our waitresses attention and she said she would let the head cook know. She even took the plastic piece from us but no further action was taken. With all of the places you can eat in Vegas I would skip Guy's.",

The menu is largely fried items that you can find anywhere ,basically extremely expensive bar food. My boyfriend and I were not super hungry so we decided to split the $21 Kobe burger and have a small Caesar salad. The burger was very thin, overdone, and tasted like a generic frozen patty.  The Caesar was ok, but not memorable in any way. The only redeeming notes were my boyfriend's margarita and our server, Greg, who was exceptional on a busy day. Guy, I expected way more from you!",

I ordered the Whiskey infused chocolate cake to go and coffee while I waited for my order at the bar. The bartenders were on top of everything, super sweet and fun to be around.  This review is only for the cake to be honest. While it was $13, it was worth it in Vegas! The cake was at least 4 layers super rich, chocolatey, and delicious! There are chocolate shavings on the outside and top of the cake and drizzled with whiskey and chocolate sauce.The cake slice is also super huge, so large enough to share with another person, or can be eaten in two servings.  It was the only dessert I had in Vegas and was totally worth it.",

I don't remember our servers names (sorry) because my boyfriend and I were drunk (hence Vegas vacay) and the girl with red hair was so nice when she delivered our burger and trash can nacho. THE TRASH CAN NACHOS LIKE OMG- must try!! I asked her about the Bloody Mary's since the menu told us to haha and she explained the different sizes etc... we don't like Bloody Mary's but ordered one anyways and look at that picture I attached. OMG!!! Our real server came over (guy with black beard and black hair) and explained how they made it extra special for us since we basically ordered the drink for a picture lol boyfriends brother loves Bloody Mary's. What a great experience.   We ended up coming back the next day after a pool party (shit-faced haha) and I remember our server was super nice again. Great service. Don't remember his name but he was tall, dark hair, and very good looking / big muscles (probably a male stripper at night). We got the philly cheesesteak and the steak entree. Steak on steak. The food and atmosphere is great but the customer service was perfect.   I already recommended this place to my friend that's visiting Vegas next month and I will forsure be dining at this restaurant every time I'm in town yay!!",

Trash can nachos were on the agenda, and they did not disappoint.. now we did have to send them back the first time because they were not warm, but second go round the melty oozy cheese and smoky meat was great! Laura our bartender made everything great and was a fun addition to keep us entertained... We've had the burgers, we've had the salads, and now the nachos, and all were good.  Ambiance is industrial cowpoke, prices are slightly above expectation(but it's Vegas where you aren't supposed to leave with any money, and staff was fab! MILITARY DISCOUNT = BONUS!!  We will surely be back to try something new next go round...",

I substituted a small salad in place of the fries. The hamburger was a 5 and my sandwich was a 4. The lemon balsamic salad dressing was very light and refreshing. The hamburger was the best I have ever tasted. My chicken sandwich was good but not exceptional. I actually wasn't thrilled about the pineapple on the sandwich and I like pineapple. The fries had interesting seasonings including barbecue flavorWe really enjoyed the patio because we could people watch and listen to the music from Harrah's. This is a definite location to get an awesome hamburger. The service was fantastic and I highly recommend.   Had a little issue with being seated on our 2nd visit but after we got to our table all was good.",

Only staying here because he needs to get food in him and we're already down  The outside menu board had breakfast on there which lured us in (no mention of when it ends). We sat down and were handed lunch menus only. Asked for breakfast and our server wasn't happy about it and proceeded to try to verbalize the menu but I asked twice for it to be handed to us so we could scope it. He wasn't thrilled about and gave us 2 seconds to read it and said we HAD to order NOW.   What kind of BS is this?! We are rushed to order because they can't get their shit together about that time breakfast service ends and are then grumpy when we ask for that specific menu.   We ended splitting a burger which was good. But asked a beer but came like 20 mins later....were they brewing it themselves or something ?!   Overall, could have done without coming here. There are def better places in Vegas with better service.",

The barbecue sauce was ok but good barbecue tastes good without sauce.   I also purchased the sashimi taco and it was very sweet! It was ok but would not recommend it.   The service was fine. There were a couple \"Vegas\" tourists being loud but hey it's Vegas! Portions large, meal price ok except the drinks were very expensive.

Sure, he may look like he's perpetually stuck in 2002 and dress like Bowser on vacation at Race Wars from the earlier Fast & Furious movies, but he also appears to be a solid dude who helps out in the community and just really, really loves food. Glass houses, throwing stones, etc.  Let's go to the menu for item names: Jalapeno Pig Poppers Trash Can Nachos The Pork Emporium Chicken Parm-eroni Tatted-Up Turkey Burger Motley Que Pulled Pork Sandwich  How about some of these bon mots in the item descriptions: SMC (super melty cheese) Guy's blue-sabi (blue cheese + wasabi) breaded + fried airline chicken breast \"dirty\" fried rice donkey sauce donkey sauce donkey sauce the \"OG\" of sandwiches a liberal slathering of A1 Donkey sauce  I don't know why the last Donkey sauce was capitalized either.  Food and drinks are priced for Vegas. Wait staff and timing was about average. The offerings themselves were very good. Sriracha wings especially were a noteworthy highlight. Had a friend get the Kobe burger and he swears by it. Pulled pork sandwich definitely worth a try.  Look, there are a ton of these type of places littering the strip. At the very least, you know the guy who created this one loves food so much he describes it like a kid on meth.",

If it were food alone, I'd stop at three stars because the kobe burger was honestly fairly disappointing; the tuna poke tacos were very good on our first visit, so much so that I returned the next day expecting the burger to be astounding, and it wasn't, while having a price of almost $22.  I do like that you can get the burgers as a lettuce wrap.  The margaritas were great; I prefer the VIP.  They are fairly tart, but our bartenders on both days of our visit were willing to put some extra Grand Marnier in to mellow things out.  The chocolate cake shot is a fun one with a procedure to follow; sugar, drink, lemon, and then the chocolate cake taste kicks in and you're like wow that's really good.  So, fun place, great service, but if you were expecting a superb burger either because of the price or Guy's tv shows / reputation, I didn't think it lived up to expectations.",

First off let's get the fries talked up. About 3 or 4 different cuts of taters, fried right, twice I would guess and seasoned with a light salt,garlic and maybe paprika ??? Not good but great.  Now let's talk about this fine steer that gave his all to donate this fine brisket to the meal. Guy's technicians did the memory of this creature honor. Smoked just right, moist and chopped from 1/2\" slices. Just the correct mix of inside and outside meat. Not sure if I have had better? Would need a Pepsi challenge to tell.  Now let's talk sauce. Perfected Guy! Just the right blend of brown sugar/molasses ? Garlic,raisin paste,maybe anchovies and a little clove?  Wait staff were more than friendly and were anxious to pamper. Open concept kitchen clean, modern and well managed.  Overall this formerly fatkid sez this place is borderline 11.",

For the record, they're Snyder's pretzel sticks, wrapped in salami, sprinkled with parmesan and parsley, and served alongside a bowl of fondue. AMAZING. One of my favorite appetizers anywhere.  The burger doesn't crack my top 25. It was actually really disappointing.  And they have frozen shots of Fireball. If you're into that sort of thing.",

They forgot to mention that each burger comes with extra napkins! On the menu there's salads, sandwiches, and burgers but for the Guy Fieri experience, I think you gotta go with a signature burger. As a plus, each burger comes with a fries sampler with 4 different types of cuts so you don't have to order fries on the side. Don't expect much from the fries though, just average.   We shared the Mac n Cheese burger and asked them to cut it in half for us since I knew it was going to be monstrous. We also got the rojo rings (HUGE onion rings) and it came with this surprisingly great sriracha/ketchup dipping sauce. We even used it for the fries that came with the burger. It was messy to eat but so tasty, and I'm not even a fan of mac n cheese. Btw I think the menu said it won some sort of nyc burger competition in 2013 so there you go!  P.S. there's no cooling system if you choose to sit outside so keep that in mind for the summer time",

The wings were ok, certainly not great.  The nachos had the most flavorless jalapenos and the brisket tasted like cold cuts.  For my entree, I had the poutine.  The gravy and cheese were melted in a pool at the bottom of the bowl.  One congealed mass.  The fries were nice and crisp and they stayed crisp.  The \"steak\" was, I kid you not, 6 bites of the toughest meat I ever had.  The flat iron was not properly trimmed, and was totally streaked with connective tissue.  It was impossible to cut.  I had ordered a side Caesar salad.  It was billed as being garlicky.  The salad came out when I was almost done with my entree.  It tasted like Sysco dressing, no flavor.  The croutons which were so tantalizingly described on the menu, were nothing more than torn pieces of stale bread.  One saving grace of this place is that they had good beer from Victory Brewing Company (Golden Monkey) and IPA from Pizza Port.",

The croutons are some sort of Parmesan and Rosemary... Awesome! My boyfriend ordered the classic burger, I believe. I tried a bite and meat was the perfect ratio of fat to beef, the bun was extremely soft and fluffy, but held up well. He commented multiple time about how it was the best burger he'd ever had. He is a food snob with a few things and burgers are one of them. Guy certainly picked an amazing menu! Service was great as well.",

We then sat and waited another 15 mins to even be greeted by a server who was actually flagged down for us by another table nearby that noticed we had been waiting a while.. the server seemed nice but unapologetic about our wait and even stated that he wasn't the server for our section but he would take our order .. he took our order and the food came out quickly but incorrectly. A new server took over our table after the food was dropped and she was very nice but not attentive enough. we then waited another 20mins just to flag her down for the check as she zoomed by checking  every table but ours.

The food was tasty however very over priced for what was served.  The Mac and cheese burger tasted well but was dried out.  The fries are over seasoned.  It is like eating the crumbs from the bottom of a bag of bbq chips. Chicken wings were good except that the larger ones were raw and bleeding in the center.  Ketchup would have helped the fries and burger go down but apparently there is a shortage here. You get approximately one package served in a small container.  No opportunity to get more because Raymond was too busy elsewhere (visiting with other staff).  The wings went uneaten and were removed from the bill. No apology or resolution.   Our biggest impression was how unwelcome we felt and that the waiters would prefer no that customers were present.",

Pros: Great Atmosphere , great staff and nice presentation of food. I loved the great music coming from the promenade, that was tons of fun!! While waiting.on my food I mingled with other guest checking out their food which looked good, this alone got me excited Cons: Quality was lacking I ordered truffle fries which was very greasy to the point it looked under cooked ( just bad) my husband got a burger and for $18 I expected more burger it was a really thin patty, our waiter told us they were all the same size. ( we wanted the biggest one) we brought our son and of course there was no kids menu or anything priced cheap enough to buy for a child. I also thought the menu was just lacking of different options. I actually left feeling sad and disappointed b/c I begged my husband to take me here all week and this just did not make the grade. What a disappointment!! However since im local I will give it another try in a few months maybe they will work some of the kinks out. Im a believer of giving second chances",

    "text": "Decor is fantastic. Location is great for type of food. Casual. Unfortunately we tried it two mornings on our Vegas trip and the service is the slowest of any bar or restaurant we visited this weekend. No other place cam close. 45 minutes the first morning. 15 minutes the second morning. Just sitting at the ledge overlooking walker-by people. Second morning after 15 I headed into bat to order bloody Mary's. They are excellent just not worth the wait. The location is excellent just not sure worth the wait. Did witness bartender making the drink - not sure I would make the bartender put all accompaniments together each Bloody Mary. Seems to add 1 to 2 minutes instead of they were ready would take about 10 seconds. Not a big difference if making 3 or 4. This place is making dozens. Tried breakfast plate. Was ok. Price for everything isn't too high.",

    "text": "We came here mainly just to say that we did, during a recent weekend getaway. We stopped in on a Thursday night after a trip to the High Roller. There were 4 of us (2 couples) and we all started with a  variety of drinks...I opted for the \"Lemon Drop - Not\" and it was very good. We shared the Vegas Fries and the General's Wings. Both very good. We ordered 2 of the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese burgers to share between the 4 of us, again just because we felt that we \"had\" to order this dish if we were at Guy's restaurant. We weren't expecting much to be honest. We were all so pleasantly surprised that this was the best burger ever! It was fabulous and I want to go back to Vegas just for this burger, and this is not something that I would normally have picked from a menu!   Then the highlight of our night when we jokingly asked our server when Guy would be joining us. He pointed and said he's right there if you want to ask him. Sure enough, Guy was in town and we had the opportunity to meet him. He even took some selfies with us...yes, he took the selfies. It was a fun way to spend our first night in Vegas.",

For a Friday night the wait wasn't too bad about 45 minutes. But we got lucky and some spots on the bar opened up so sat down. Ordered some beers (great beer selections by the way) and Los Nachos del Jefe which were on point. Then on to the main event, The Off-Da-Hook Original Smash-Burger.  The name fits it perfectly it is definitely off the hook, the brioche bun is a great complement to Guy's Bourbon sauce. Bring your appetite as this thing is not only tasty but big.  The fries were also excellent but the main attraction is the burger.  If you  are looking for a burger in Vegas that will fill you up and make you happy this is the one!",

It was big and full of flavor. I personally didn't find it as enjoyable but if you are a mac and cheese lover you may love it too. I had the pastrami burger and it was full of different ingredients that made it unique, tasty and full of flavor. Id rate the burgers a 4 out of 5 for sure! The fries were a mixture of crinkle and thin, they were overpowered with seasoning and cold/stale. While we were waiting to be seated, we saw a man putting fries on a load of plates before the burgers were done-I really think we got one of those that were sitting out for 20 minutes or so. We just didnt eat the fries. The prices were a tad overpriced, we had to wait 15 minutes for a seat with multiple tables open and cleaned and the fries were just a big disappointment. Overall this was a good restaurant, burgers were good but old stale fries removed a star.",

We sat at the bar and our server was fantastic, she actually helped us the first time we were there before we sat down at our table.  Service was wonderful, she suggested some of the bigger drinks to split to save some money! That was a hit with us since we were a group of 8 girls there for a long bachelorette weekend.  The turkey picnic sandwich is awesome!! I got it both times.  My husband got a sandwich with chicken and sausage, he loved it.  Their fries are very unique and taste like BBQ chips!! Love it!

We are taking the time to write this review and giving only 2 stars because of our disappointment with the food quality (again) AND the sticky/messy/dirty condition of the bar seating area.    We live here in Vegas and have been going to this location since we moved to the area in 2015.  This is our 10th time total, first time in the last 9 months. We noticed a decline in overall food quality the last 2 times we were there - lacking in usual flavors and noticable lower ingredient quality.  Figured it was a bad day (morning), the first time, so we tried again. When it happened again at lunch time...well, that's why it took 9 months to give it one more try. SO BUMMED!  Guy's Kitchen & Bar was one of the places we used to take visitors to :(  The meat quality/flavor was not there (hamburger & steak sandwich); the fries were old, possibly fried a second time to heat up & both our breads were a bit stale. Again the usual flavors and freshness were not there. Not up to the expectations given the celeb name and prices. Thank goodness the bar staff were great.   As for the cleanliness issue, the bar top was clean (busboy also great), but the bar rails & floor were a sticky/grimmy mess. Not a \"someone spilled a few beers AND syrup TODAY\"  sticky, but rather a \"not properly cleaned or cleaned with dirty rags LAST COUPLE DAYS\"  sticky.  My husband was in restaurant mgmt biz for +25 years, so he could tell. SO BUMMED!",

    "text": "Saturday, August 5, 2017 - 1:00PM Lunch Seating: Table (Inside) Party: 2 Adults  This was somewhat my first time to Guy Fieri's Kitchen. Let me explain. Went on a Carnival Cruise back in March and the cruise had a Guy's Burger Join, and it was AMAZING. So when I came to Vegas (with the same friend I went on the cruise with), my party and I thought we needed to, without a doubt, check this place out. SUCH A LET DOWN!  CUSTOMER SERVICE = 1 Stars The wait to get a table was a little lengthy (20-30 minutes) but we considered that normal since it was the middle of the lunch rush on a Saturday. Now when we got seated, our waiter was really nice, but there were so many mix ups with our order. To say the least, the entire ordeal was a disaster, and our waiter was practically absent the entire time. Both my friend and I had to flag him down to get any help.  FOOD = 1 Stars An absolute let down. First, between the time of us ordering and actually getting our food, it was about 45 minutes. I can understand a place being busy, but that's ridiculous. Next, the drinks. My friend had ordered a soda, and I got a cocktail from the bar. The soda came at a normal speed, however, my cocktail didn't arrive until after my food did. This was with having to ask my waiter twice about my drink. And sadly, the taste of the drink didn't make up for the service on getting it.  Moving on to the food. I had ordered one of Guy's famous Original Ringer Burger (a twist on a BBQ Burger). Now you can get either fries or a salad. I usually order my entree with fries, and then get the salad on the side (as an appetizer kind of deal). When the food arrived, the only thing on the plate was the burger and a salad. Additionally, not even all of the fixings came with my burger (I had to ask for them). When I asked my waiter about the fries, he said he would get them. I was charged extra for the fries (which are several more dollar charge than the salad).  In the end, for two people, we paid over $75 before the tip. Not happy.  ATMOSPHERE = 3 Stars The atmosphere was pretty nice and was Air Conditioned, something that was extremely needed for the middle of summer in Las Vegas. The decorations and theme were pretty great, and kept my table somewhat entertained as we waited for our food.  CONCLUSION: Really Disappointed. Went into Guy's really hoping to have an awesome experience, but with how much we paid, versus what we got, made the deciding factor for my friend and I; we won't be coming back on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

We had the nachos, which is served in a can and the server delivering it, removes the tin can and the nachos squirt out, . The bloody Mary's are also a must, and you can have them accompanied with a selection of of foof items as garnishes. There is a long wait time for a table, unless you get lucky and find a seat at the bar, and you avoid the wait time. Also the waffle fries are bomb!!! The kitchen is an open concept, and you can see the creative genius working as they prepare and cook your food. This is a fun place, from food to their service to all other offerings.",

Also my plate came with Mac and cheese which I had high expectations for since I always hear about the famous Mac and Cheese burger here, but it got a thumbs down for me, needed to be creamier and needed more flavor.",

The wait was long because it was a small restaurant and it was popular because it was owned by a celebrity food critic. I rate it four stars because the wait was long. The hostess said a 20 to 25 minute wait but we waited for 30 to 35 minuets. Our waiter was a little weird and it took forever for our food to come out. I recommend the Ringer Burger because it has barbecue sauce and onion rings on it. Plus the donkey sauce is really good on burgers. But the fries were hot but a little to crispy.

The place was super packed, it was maybe close to 10 am and the line was already long. Lucked out and found a seat at the bar. The Bloody is about what you'd expect from someone as gaudy as Guy (out of bounds, bro!). It's big and overflowing with garnishes.  Runs $15 but it ain't lacking in booze or flavor.  Not to mention they bring you out a small plate because you're basically getting a personal appetizer as well, what with all those garnishes.  Can't speak to the trash can nachos (although they looked interesting) but if you're in the mood for some breakfast booze, this place is as good as any.",

Got here at 3ish (Saturday) and found two empty seats at the bar (if available skip the tables and go straight to the bar). We were treated with a smile and of great news happy hour! Even better $5 shot of patron! We ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger, Montly-que sandwich, and fiery wings.   First the burger - meh.. my girl likes it. But to me the appeal of mac and cheese must've passed me cause it just tasted like an average hamburger. Meat to bun ratio is great tho! But sadly the meat was dry.   Second the montly-que was A-freaking-mazing. Nuff said!   As for the wings! Very good, a little to the salty side. The blue-cheese wasabi dressing was very good. And FYI, if your not using blue-cheese on your wings, your doing it wrong!!   Over all happy with the experience and will be back!   Oh pro-tip! During happy hour, burger comes with a beer!",

The strawberry margarita was good, but it should have been for $15. Small too, so not a good value. I will not be back, nor recommend this place to anyone.

But, for one, you're on The Strip in Vegas and for two, it has Guy Fieri's name attached to it. We had \"The Mayor of Flavortown\" burger and a Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger. Both burger's were great. The taste of the Mac and Cheese on the burger alone was worth the price. They were cooked excellent and was a huge portion. Anyone who says that they left unhappy either visited on an off day or had bad service....none of which happened to me.",

It was so hard I couldn't even cut through with a steak knife. I also had the sashimi taco, that was good and light. My fiance had mac n cheese bacon burger, it was messy, the meat fell a part and the bun was the size of a silver dollar. With the burger you get a side of fries... these aren't just regular fries, they are a variety of fries consist of steak fries, shoe string, crinkle fries, etc. My fiance started calling it left over fries, which what they tasted like. However, there, this one amazing item in this menu that I truly enjoyed.. the truffle fries. Simply delicious. The aioli was well done. Overall, decent experience,.giving them the benefit of the doubt they just opened.",

The mac n cheese burger was poorly executed and the fries tasted like they were tossed in sugar. I have a major sweet tooth and this was too much even for me. The breakfast was just as bad. The potatoes were overly sweet and the chicken apple sausage literally tastes like you're biting into sugar. Like I said, I have sweet tooth and I literately couldn't eat these items. It's ironic how everything was over seasoned yet the eggs and bacon were completely bland. When i notified my server that the sausage and potatoes were inedible she argued with me, and said that's how they're supposed to taste. Very poor customer service. I am a server as well and would have never reacted that way. Apologize and ask what you can do to fix it, don't have an attitude. Overall everything was bad. The food, our server.. do yourself a favor and eat at one of the many other options within walking distance. And know that if you are disappointed with your food nothing will be done to fix it and you'll have to pay full price for a meal you couldn't even eat.",

She took forever to bring us our drinks we ordered. When we put in our drink order, we put in an appetizer order as well of Vegas Fries. They literally came 5 minutes before our actual meal came. We waited 40 minutes for those fries, which was the only good thing out of the whole meal. Two of us ordered the bacon Mac and cheese burger and two others ordered the ringer burger. The bacon Mac and cheese had very little cheese and macaroni. I paid $22 for this burger and there was no flavor besides the meat. I could have walked down the Linq Promenade and had Yardhouse for half the price, better food, and great service. The waitress took 15 minutes to refill our drinks and that was after we sat there waiting for her to come back outside for almost 20 minutes. My friend asked for a refill of her beer when our food arrived and she didn't receive it until after we were finished eating. And Rada was rude, never said you're welcome when we said thank you when she finally came to our table and never had a smile on her face. She should take notes on the other wait staff that works there who attended their tables efficiently.",

I had a pool of grease on my \"plate\" which is hard to say since their food is served on a wood cutting board. If there is enough grease to soak through the wax paper and soak into the wood \"plate\" and still leave a puddle, there is a problem.   The mac and cheese burger was just as bad. Something on the burger caused the bottom bun to become a soggy mess. My wife had to resort to eating the burger with a fork and leaving the bottom bun behind. While I appreciate the cook helping us watch our carbs, we would have liked to make that decision ourselves.   My wife also ordered the berry mojito. It was undrinkable. The bartender put so much mint in it that when my wife fished it out of the glass and placed it on her plate, she could have made a side salad out of it. I'm certain this must have been their way of helping us eat healthy, after all, they were helping us watch are carbs with the buns too. However, a side salad of just mint isn't good for anything but fresh breath. Seriously, this wad of mint was almost the size of my fist. It left a terrible grassy, minty, bitterness to her drink.   My draft Blue Moon was good though, so I guess there is that.",

    "text": "First the good. It was within walking distance from our hotel and the water was ice cold. I will only speak on the items with which I have experience. My friend and I searched the web for a great burger and Guy's Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar was listed as one of the 10 best in Vegas. Sadly for my friend, and I, it was not a good burger. We ordered the Ringer and the Bacon Mac and Cheese and our wives had the Trash Can Nachos. We asked for the burgers medium rare and were shunned for doing so by our server, \"because it was a smashed burger\" whatever that is supposed to mean. So we opted for medium and ordered the \"Bacon Mac and Cheese\" without the onion straws (just an Item I have never liked so nothing against Guy on this one) and \"The Ringer\". The \"Ringer\" came out  medium rare/medium and the Bacon Mac and Cheese came out medium well. We ordered them at the same time...how can this happen?More toppings (finely shredded lettuce) than burger. I would equate them both to those sandwiches you get off a lunch truck ...all of the goodies are shoved up front to make it more show than go. The mac n cheese was good, but for that burger that was where it ended for me. Not plentiful and lacking in flavor. For the Ringer (we ordered these to split/ share). I hardly noticed the Super Melty Cheese (SMC) and again the lettuce, too much of it. In my mind the price of the burgers were more suited in the $12 to $15 dollar range and that would be stretching it. No flavor. The fries... I think they were Ore Ida... The seasoning was good and made up for the fact they did not seem like they were fresh cut in any way. The Trash Can Nachos. Again the chips did not seem to be made on site like the fries. My observation and it may be incorrect. The queso was for all intents and purposes velveeta and rotel (if it were that-it would have been better). The BBQ sauce and pork...the bright spot in this meal good flavor there but must have again memorable. We would order the Nachos again, but for us this overall experience was a \"wouldnt have to have it again\" experience. Our wives liked the Trash Can Nachos...but enjoyed would be strong.   I will say that after having read other reviews our service was good, our waitress was attentive, a little off on the timing but not a disqualifier in my book. Some of the reviews I read slammed the service, as a waitress for many years my wife and her friend would have said something if it was off. So no complaint there on this one. To be honest I live in Colorado and have been to 2 of the places Guy has recommended on Triple D. I even copied the recipe for pork green chili from the Lodge in Fort Collins because it was so good. The other place was a diner in the Truest of forms and we enjoyed it a lot! I watch Triple D and love to try to gain experience cooking the recipes on the show based on how Guy presents restaurants in his show. Guy has a love for food that brought me to improve my game which has a long way to go. As a chef I bet Guy Fieri is awesome...as a restaurant promoter/owner, I was honestly so disappointed It shocked me and our friends. We could have saved money and enjoyed In and Out and not had a wait. The price of the Burger shows that Guy takes pride in his recipes yet the quality of what is there (again only burgers were had) shows that the restaurant is trying to get by on his name.",

Mr. Fieri always loses points because he reminds people of the guy in the frat who got the girl you wanted, or the frat guy who never called you back once you gave him what he was looking for. If you don't like his image so much that you won't set foot in his restaurant, then you are the one who will be missing out. Killer bloody Mary. It's 52 ounces, shareable, and comes garnished with so much food that it's almost a meal in itself.",

This has a chain restaurant feel to it when you first get in but it surpasses that feeling once the food comes.  My girlfriend and I split the nachos, which were really good. Good portion and very tasty. We also ordered two kinds of wings, the General Wings and the BBQ.  I enjoyed both for sure, as one was sweet and the other (general wings) a bit on the spicy side.  Both were very good and all of it was too much food for both of us. Wait staff was a little slow but was apologetic, but was odd that it would be slow for a Thursday at Noon.  The burgers looked INSANELY good so if/when I go back I would definitely get one.",

We have eaten at Guys other restaurant  at the Rio (el burro borracho) and liked it enough to try this restaurant. First the waiter was less than friendly and seemed annoyed when my hubby asked him about an entree, not a good start. We ordered the Big Dipper Sandwich and Lobster Tacos. The 3 mini tacos were good, a bit too spicy for my liking (my fault for not asking)but good chunks of meat in them. Dirty rice was good. Worth $25? Maybe. The Sandwich was nothing special. Bun was boring and meat was fatty. Came with a skimpy side of fries; not what you'd expect being served with a Steak Sandwich. They are the  cheapest vegetable; throw some fries on that plate! We won't go back to this restaurant but will probably go back to his el burro borracho at the Rio.",

Located inside the newly revamped Linq Casino, this place is nearest to the exit heading to Harrahs.  The narrow small entrance creates a  slow flow area as everyone is funneled in and out of this place.  It has the feel of a DDD place and the ambiance is loud.  The menu was surprisingly disappointing.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised since it was really limited to bar food.  I have tried a number of sandwiches and my immediate reaction is that they really try to do too much.  Sometimes simple is better.  I really don't like a sloppy sandwich and that is what you'll get here.  Nonetheless, I did like the 3 different fries and I found the meals mostly tasty and quite large.",

I'm happy to report that after the experience, I'm glad we did and would totally do it again!   The wife and I tend to go big for dinners in Vegas, so this was a great option for lunch.  We arrived around 1p and there was approximately a 30-min wait.  The beauty of being in a casino is that it is SUPER easy to kill a half hour (thank you, Craps table!)  Before we knew it, we got the text that our table was ready and we were seated very soon thereafter.   As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of mac & cheese, the wife, with ZERO hesitation, got the Bacon Mac & Cheeseburger ($20; crispy applewood bacon, six-cheese mac 'n' cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle, garlic-buttered brioche bun) and was very pleased.  The burger itself wasn't anything spectacular, but the combination of the bacon, mac & cheese, garlic butter was juicy, flavorful, and downright awesome.   I went with The Original Ringer Burger ($18; crispy rojo onion ring, bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle + donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche bun) and it was outstanding.  The onion ring was huge and crispy, and the BBQ sauce was a sweet compliment to the saltiness of the breading.   The Quad Fries that come with the burger are awesome.  They are equal parts shoestring, waffle, wedge, and crinkle fries with some super-delicious BBQ-like seasoning salt.  Delicious, and makes each bite just slightly different!!!   My main detractor from 5 Stars is value.  Yeah, I get that we are in Vegas and you have to pay for the Guy Fieri name on the marquee, but $20 for a bacon cheeseburger is a little steep, even by Vegas standards.",

    "text": "Minus a few undesirable kinks, Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar was a superb dinner dining experience for my girlfriend and I while we were visiting Vegas. The restaurant itself is quite large, providing a variety of seating options - including a bar - and features hilarious photos on the walls and signature items from one of the industry's most recognizable chefs. The atmosphere was lively, with plenty of dining groups having a blast chowing and chatting away. Some may complain about the menu prices, but honestly, if you're not aware of the Vegas Strip standards on food and drink - common knowledge for anyone who's visited even once - don't bother going out! Appies are in the $17 range while mains average between $19 and $35.  Before I review the food and drinks - which were totally delicious - I should note the few bumps that made this review instantly drop from five to four stars. For one, the washrooms are outside of the premises, which I know is not uncommon in Las Vegas casinos where there are shared business washrooms similar to a mall, but these washrooms - 'bathrooms' for Yankee readers - were a 90 second walk out of the restaurant, making it a minor inconvenience. Even more of a downfall was our main server's lack of enthusiasm and friendliness when taking our orders, bringing our food and drinks, and taking forever to come over with the machine when we were paying up. He was very unprofessional and could surely use some some proper hospitality training or even advice from more knowledgeable staff.  All that being said, we absolutely loved the food and drinks we had here; we started with the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. At $14.50, these pepperoni-based breadsticks were filling and tasty, with a soft focaccia-like breading that had the pepperoni blended in. The kicker - creamy smoked Provolone and pork sausage dips that would have been equally amazing served with wings. After realizing we were beyond half full - the breadsticks come in a sizeable portion - we tackled the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger, Guy Fieri's award-winning burger, and voted one of the best burgers in Las Vegas. It comes with Quad Fries (really, really good stuff) and sits at $21.50. The beef was super fresh; the secret sauce was tangy, contrasting the beef, the veggies were fresh; the soft brioche bun had delightful garlic butter on it; crispy applewood-smoked bacon. The burger was also not overcooked, lending a nice softness that complimented the bun. Try the fries - I need not even explain how great they were! I have had the pleasure of trying many a burger in my day, but I must say this one definitely ranks in my top 10 best ever! MONEY! The girlfriend and I each enjoyed one of their Cucumelon cocktails - Effen cucumber vodka, fresh cucumber and watermelon juice, lemon squeeze, and tonic - and found them refreshing and boozy, but also steeply priced at $15! For $38, however, you have the option to get any cocktail in a punch bowl for the whole table to slurp up.  I so wish I could give Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar a 5/5 - I would do it for the food in a second - but perhaps this place could work a bit on training their staff to always work with a smile and be conscious of the diner's needs at all times. In the hospitality industry, you only really get one chance to get things right. We'll be back for the food regardless!",

I ordered the bacon and mac n cheese burger and I was pleased with it and it was like a 4 1/5 for me at least. It had a double patty which I didn't know until I ate it lol. The Mac n cheese on the burger tasted authentic and great but personally I wished there was more Mac but that's just me. The theming of this place wasn't the complete best because like I felt like there isn't enough effort put into it making it unique or authentic. Like I wished there were more things of guy and what he does so the restaurant guests could interact. Like the open kitchen is cool but not interesting enough to get a majority's attention.",

The burrito is wrapped in a quesadilla which was extra filling. The black beans were seasoned really nicely and overall it was super tasty. Their mimosas are very strong ($10 for a single glass). I'd definitely return for another breakfast burrito!",

My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  He convinced me to take a bite and it was rather tasty.  I'm not a fan of pulled pork because I don't like bbq sauce.  The sauce was mild though; you can tell it was homemade.  Probably the best tasting one I've had so far...and I've only had very few.  Not convinced that I'll ever like pulled pork.  The portions could be better; I wasn't too hungry but if I was I think I would've ordered an appetizer and a main entree.  The food presentations were cool though.

They also forgot our appetizer and by the time we received it, we were finished with our main course and didn't want it. They made us pay for it - for something they forgot. In addition, it took them 45 mins to give us our bill. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

    "text": "Horrible service!! The Asian host needs some customer service training and an attitude adjustment. She has a straight out of high school attitude, poor service skills, and a trashy mouth.  We took my mom here to celebrate her 52nd bday because she is a big fan of Guy Fieri. The estimated wait time was 45 min, which we were totally okay with and surprised when we got a \"table ready\" text, after waiting only 15-20 min. It was 7:48pm when I received this text.  Our server was great at first. We ordered a few cocktails, an appetizer and 3 burgers.  They then seated a couple to our right, and then two ladies to our left. Both parties were served there appetizers, and then burgers, and FINISHED before we were ever served our meals. Our server came out 3 times to tell us our food was \"on its way\". If you forgot to place the order or something got messed up in the kitchen, whatever the case, just let us know so it's not a waiting game!! We were chatting with the couple next to us all night and even they were amazed.  By 9:20, hour and a half later, our server was nowhere to be found, so I told another server if he can let ours know to just box our food. Our server comes out with 3 plates and says \"oh are you sure you want boxes?\" And thinking the food he was holding was ours, we said now we weren't sure. He says \"ok it will be right out.\" And serves the now third table that's come in after us. We were done waiting and requested a manager and walked up to the host area. No kidding another 20 minutes passed and we were pissed!!  At this point we wanted to pay our tab for the drinks and appetizer and leave. We explained this to a different host and she said \"I have no idea where the mgr is, let me get the chef.\" Uhhm ok?  Here comes the other Asian host, Ms. Thing with her poor attitude and rolling eyes. My parents were upset, especially my mom because this was her bday night!! And she loves Guy Fieri!! She was disappointed and telling Ms. Thing, and the young girl just gave attitude and very smartass remarks. Extremely unprofessional!   The mgr FINALLY comes out, no apology at all, just stated that our server said the two parties next to us \"ate faster\" than we did. Dumbest thing I've ever heard. Seriously.  Says he'll be right back with the check.  10 more minutes. My dad tells the host if the mgr doesn't come back in 2 min we are leaving. She states \"That's fine I ran track in highschool I'll chase you down.\" WHAT?!??? What in the hell? The look on the faces of the people standing in line observing this whole thing, some were laughing at the little girl and one group turned around and left!!  Finally the manager comes out and I don't even know why at this point but we paid the tab and left.  I've met Guy before, he's a cool dude and I'm a fan of his show, but it's really a shame this is how his restaurant is ran. I work for Caesar's Ent. and I LOVE the Linq! I'm always telling my guests that it's definitely a spot to hit while in Vegas and I will sadly not be recommending this restaurant. We made it up to my mom the next night and took her to Burgr at Planet Hollywood.",

Will not recommend to any of my friends.  If only Guy Fieri would take a few pointers from the restaurants he visits on his show, Diners, Drive in, and Dives, maybe this place would be good.

I waited 53 minutes for a table for myself. I didn't mind waiting 53 minutes even though I seen several several different parties come in after me then get seated right away. I'm not sure why it's so hard for one person to have a table and not be required to sit at the bar.   Once seated by the very friendly hostess I sat there and sat there and sat there while 3 other parties were sat and orders taken all the while I never get got to order a drink. After about 15 minutes of sitting there the bus boy brought me a water and apologized and said he would find the sever he didn't know where or why he had not helped me. So I waited another 5 minutes and just had to get up and walk out. I've never had to walk out of a resturant for not being served it truly struck me and made me feel very upset and uncomfortable  wondering why I was neglected as if I had done something  wrong.  I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone and therefore I cannot recommend  the resturant. The one star is for the amazing frendily hostess.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 10, 4 of us got sick. Not because of anything that was poorly cooked, but simply the amount of fat and grease used to cook the meals here is absolutely unnecessary. My stomach still hasnt settled 13 hours later. Everything is to the extreme, the sausage is too sweet, my potatoes were battered and deep fried, the bacon in my bloody mary was candied with maple syrup and brown sugar. I really enjoyed the bloody Mary, and that was definitely the highlight, but really it was just just over the top. I feel like they're going for shock factor more than actually good food. It was a heart attack on a plate. One person got the mac and cheese bacon burger, he ate the whole thing and then proceeded to spend the next 6 hours back at his hotel room nursing his stomach. My body is nowhere near used to that amount of fat and grease. I guess that's part of the novelty of the restaurant.....but unfortunately that's all it is, a novelty.",

The staff are extremely friendly but can't get a simple order correct for the life of them.  Wine is wine and there aren't that many beers to overwhelm the average bartender.  We spoke with other diners who had ordered turkey burgers and were not happy.  We had ordered the nachos with beef short rib which we had ordered without cilantro.  To our dismay, the nachos came with extra cilantro and were sent back.  On an afternoon with very little business, I would have expected that the order would be correct.  It is very loud and lacked a special lure as compared  to other sites along the strip.  Customer service was only so-so.  The next trip to Las Vegas will not include a trip to Guy Fieri's spot.",

After 35 minutes and no text, we walk back and hostess does not remember us and says must have lost our reservation. Waited another 10 minutes, and then they would not seat us because only 7 of our party of 8 was present.  One went in search of other food due to the wait!  Finally they seat us at 10:50 AM, but now tell us we can't order breakfast because it's too late.  They open at 9:00; you only serve breakfast for an hour and forty five minutes?  Ordered Bloody Mary's and apps, we sat and watched 4 tables that were seated after us get their food; 40 minutes till our apps arrive. Waitress never came back once to ask if we wanted another round, and we had 7 individuals sitting with empty drinks, not even a water refill.  Bloody's were ok, but at $15 per they should be, apps were average to poor; brisket was too fatty, food was barely warm at best, BBQ sauce on nachos over powering. Nothing was worth the price point, and service was awful and sooooo slow.   Bottom line: Service was so terrible we ate and gambled across street at Mirage for the next 2 days.  LINQ, you lost revenue from a party of 8 for an entire weekend because of the absolute worst service we have ever experienced.  Stay away from this place at all costs, too many good places and stellar service in Vegas to give them any of your business....speak with your wallets or they will never improve.",

If you follow triple D at all, you'll notice that the decor of this place has Guy written all over it.  It's not a huge place inside, but they also offer outdoor seating.  Since it was about 35 degrees outside, we weren't interested in that, despite having heat lamps.  The only knock I have against this place is that the menu is a bit limited.  There were several things that looked good to me, but my wife was struggling to find something.  I had the Bacon Mac and Cheese Burger, while my wife decided on a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  Each sandwich comes with a variety of different fries, which is cool.  You get crinkle cut, shoestring, wedge, waffle, etc.  I thought that was a cool idea.  The portions here are enormous, so be sure to bring your appetite.  My wife and I could barely finish half of our meals.  I thought the food tasted really good, so I'd be willing to give this place another shot.  It might be best to spilt a meal between two people, since they're so large.  It's probably not the best place to bring kids, as it's loud and there's a lot of boozing going on.  All in all, I'm a fan of Guy, and I thought his restaurant in Vegas was good.  We got out of here for about $40-$50 for the two of us.  Give this place a shot if you're in Vegas, and sit out on the patio if it's nice outside.",

Starting right off, whether you're a fan or not of Bloody Mary drinks, you have got to check out their customizable mary menu--- pick your vodka, pick a garnish including candied bacon, shrimp or chicken.....pick your heat, pick five additives, including celery, carrots, pickled veggies, pineapple, etc and Wha-la! you have created your own - one-of-a-kind masterpiece! Parley that Bloody Mary with one of their excellent breakfast dishes and you have got yourself an experience. Over two trips this is what we liked in order  from best to least best: Chilaquiles Breakfast Burrito Chili Benedict French Toast All items were about $15-$16 but get a player card at the Casino to receive $1 off each item.

This brought us to just under 90.00. Our fries tasted as tho they had been sitting under a heating lamp. They were were far from fresh. My burger tasted no different then smash burger(a local spot ) except it had bland Mac and cheese scooped onto it. My husbands wings were nothing to talk about.  We compared them to wing stop(local spot). Our mushrooms were just blah. The mushrooms at bjs brewery were WAYYYYY better and half the price.

So this review is just of their food, though their service was good - no complaints. (Actually, two bartenders fought over serving me...luckily, the male-half of them won out. :-) )  The burger was $20 and I would only spend that on a burger and fries in Vegas. Otherwise, this was worth about $13. Don't get me wrong; it was good, just too damn big. Eventually, I had to use the plastic fork and knife. And the Mac & Cheese stayed with the burger, which I liked.   The fries were a mixture of two brands; very nice. Unfortunately, the ketchup they gave me to go I had to be extremely conservative on since it was such a small portion.  And speaking of small portions, I'm gonna need to order their smallest burger next time. This was a chore to eat. Again, still good, just hard to eat. I do have a big mouth...just not for actual food.  Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar (/5 Stars.)",

We had about a 30 minute wait because we wanted to sit outside.  The decor has a lot of the Guy flavor which I loved.  He has his sauces on display for you to purchase, and most of the T.V.'s are playing past episodes of Triple D.  The outside eating area is nice and quaint...we even witnessed a wedding proposal!!!  Starter was the Fireball whiskey wings to share...amaz!  We both ordered the signature mac and cheeseburger that comes with fries...another big hit in my book!",

While the food was pretty good, felt it could of been a lot better, considering this is Guy Fieri's restaurant. Am a huge burger guy so I ordered the burger, was a little dry and lacked flavor. Bowl of chili was tasty, had a good heat level.  Customer service was decent, but needs improvement. It was mainly slow.  Decor is pretty cool.  Hopefully they can work out some of the issues with the food and service, other than it's a good place.",

Unfortunately time didn't allow me to experience the flavor this trip......so we squeezed in brunch. Now....as my wife reminded me....I made a rookie mistake when we visited this establishment. I went for the safest dish instead of venturing for the unusual or unknown to my pallet. With that said I will honestly say that I ordered bacon, sausage, and eggs......with a huge biscuit. Quite frankly it was......just a plain ol' breakfast. No surprises there.......not even the Vegas sticker price!  LOL!!  The Mimosa's were real good. I look forward to coming back to try a Guy's inspired burger!!",

Served with raw veggies. My husband had the 'The Original Ringer Burger' with fries. He said it was a good burger. I had the 'Hawaiian Huli Chicken Sandwich' with fries. The sandwich was messy to hold so ate it with a knife and fork, tasty sandwich. I like the trio of different French fries. Service was fine.",

I ended up ordering the Spiked Koolaid. Very dangerous drink. Tasted like fruit punch with minimal to no alcohol taste....of course this may be due to the fact that there was minimal alcohol in it. I ordered the lobster tacos.....the sauce drizzled over was delicious. A bit of a kick but not overboard. The lobster...I'm a New England native so I know lobster. Not making accusations but my guess was this was frozen lobster. Chewy, tough and flavorless. Service was friendly but a bit slow. If you're into celebrity restaurants you may want to check it out. If you're into good food, you may want to keep looking!",

It is a mans soap in my house.  ahha  That being said, we had to go here while in Vegas for a few days.   We were greeted and seated immediately.  Within just a couple of minutes the waitress came up and introduced herself and asked if we had a chance to look over the drink menu.  We did and ordered.  I got the Tiki Punch and he got a beer.  They came up just a couple of moments later.  We took a few more minutes to look over food menu.  There is all kinds of things to choose from and they all have funky, silly names, makes it fun for us.  Good times.   We decided on the Mayor Of Flavor Town burger and the Nachos (forgot their funky name).  Drinks were cold and tasty. We needed them after walking out in the heat!  Food came up rather quickly.  I was a little worried when he said I have your nachos and they were in a container that looked like a flour sifter.  Scared...I was scared.  haha   Then the expeditor sets my nacho plate down and pulls up on the flour sifter...whoa, nachos everywhere.  Delicious. Pulled pork nachos.  They were very tasty.  Warning, they are a bit sweet, so if you do not like sweet bbq, you would not like these, but I do, so scrumptious.  My other half must have loved the three flavor fries that came with his burger because I only saw them as the plate was setting down.  Once my nachos were settled, his fries were gone.  No, no worries babe, I didn't want to try one anyway. hahah   So we got another beer and dug in.  The nachos were crazy delicious and his Mayor of Flavor Town was not only grand but tasty as well.  You will not go hungry here.  The plates were huge, service was excellent.  Restaurant and bar were both very clean.  Love it.  I would absolutely go back again.  Recommend anyone to visit Guy Fieri's Vegas kitchen when you are in town.  Get your grub on...Good stuff there!",

Anywho his sandwich was amazing!! The fries were awesome. They're like variety fries. Shoe strings crinkle cut these odd shaped and also basket weave looking ones. They all tasted delicious and had some different flavors going on. My burger was cool. Beautiful presentation but the Mac n cheese was pretty bland. So I just ended up eating the patty which was enough for me anyways. Service was friendly good amount of check ins. All and all good place for eats. Late night menu varied from 15-25 dollars a plate.  Good experience",

Too much meat stuff haha.  We got the chicken wings, which turned out to be way too spicy.  We also got the assorted meat platter.

We coupled it with their nachos (with brisket) and bacon wrapped jalapenos... and damn!! Hats off to Guy for an incredible tasty beverage on a 102 day, with flavorful appetizers to accompany. We were here with a group of thirsty ladies for a pre-wedding celebration. The staff was friendly, gracious, and funny. Many thanks! We'll be back!",

When we tried to bite into it.. either the bacon or egg would fall apart. Typical burger, nothing special.   Tuna poke won-taco (1 out of 5 stars) Tuna was not fresh. I could smell it as I was chewing... tuna was mixed with mango but I could still take the bad fish.  Lobster lollipop- (2 out of 5 stars) 5 pieces of tiny lobsters covered with batter on a stick but at least the dip  that came with it was good.  Fries- (2 out of 5 stars) it was a variety of Waffle, crinkle cut fries etc.  but it was way too over fried that all I could taste was the crispiness like chips. Not my type of style when it comes to fries but some will like it.",

The worst thing I  ever ate was the NY strip. I ordered medium rare and they gave me medium well. Fattiest NY strip I've ever had. It also tasted burnt. All I tasted was burnt meat. Even the potatoes tasted like they were \"stale?\" Not crunchy, not soft... it tasted like an over cooked microwaved baked potato... and it had the same flavor as the steak.. burnt!!! None of the toppings made it any better.. it was disappointing and disgusting.",

    "text": "I was staying at the Linq, and received a $35 food credit.    I went through the credit in practically one meal, but had two alcoholic drinks with that one meal.  I went three times over the course of four days  My first visit, I had something called the Tatted Up Turkey burger and it was huge but i manged to scarf the entire thing down and the pretzel bun it comes on was exactly the type of bun this sandwich called for. My mouth is watering just thinking of it.   My drink of choice was the Cucumelon. Watermelon and cucumber.  Yes, the two go together very well with Hendrick gin, so I went for a second one.  My second visit I had the Flat Iron Steak with smashed potatoes, it was basically brunch for me, around 11am so I went with one of the Bloody Mary's they sell.    Im not a bloody mary drinker at all, but this day it seemed like everyone sitting at the bar had one, and I didn't want to be the odd man out.  I was NOT disappointed. I cant tell you all the stuff they garnish the bloody mary with, but I drunk on it for maybe an hour after returning to my room and didn't eat the sausage that was part of the drink until sometime later that night.   its Vegas baby, they let you leave the restaurant with your drink   The third day I kept it simple with the Fireball Whiskey wings.  Not a fan of Fireball, but these wings were delicious and the blue cheese, please someone get guy to bottle that up and sell it at my local Publix  Get plenty of napkins and plenty of water.   Returned to the cucumelon drink.  Again, I went for a second one.   I'd happily return, even without the food and beverage credit.  This place deserves all the wonderful hype it receives.  Outdoor patio, bar seating, tables, TV  Sits between the Linq and Harrahs",

I had the Greek Salad and my husband had the wings.  They were both very tasty.   The wings were\"trimmed into \"lollipop\" shapes, to make them easier to eat\", in doing so they took  the one part of the chicken, with the least amount of meat, and cut off half of the meat to make the \"lollipop\" shape.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea, but stop it!!  Wings are messy, give me a wet nap, don't cut the meat off the wings.  Maybe they thought by taking off half of the meat, you had less to eat, thus less time to get messy??  Not sure, but for those prices, I want ALL of the meat left on my wings. I'll deal with being messy.   The Greek salad was very good, but the lettuce was not cut up, at all, and by the time I finished cutting it, and was ready to eat, my husband had eaten all but one of his wing \"lollipops\".  Thankfully I looked up in time to stop him from eating the last one and was able to try them.",

We were asked repeatedly if we needed anything. Cudos to the staff.  We hade the Vegas fries to start- I loved them, wife thought they were a tad too spicy.  We split a Mac-N-Cheese burger, which was outstanding flavor.  Mrs though it could have used more \"mac-n-cheese\" and I think she might be right.  It was a decent size so spitting wasn't bad- especially after the mound of fries.  I had 2 millers. Tap was out so they gave me two 32onz cans (with a cold glass) instead- no extra charge.  Mrs had two lemon drops drinks.  Bill was $60 which I thought was a bit on the cheap side- given the location and name on the restaurant.  I'd remind this spot.  We liked it more the Gordon's pub.

I gotta say that based on the pulled pork sandwich I had I wouldn't go back. I have definitely had better for less money. Pulled pork is definitely something that people can be picky about and I hate it when I get big chunks of fat and tough char. The pretzel bun was good but I ended up tearing the sandwich apart to pick out tye good meat and take off tye terrible sweet pickles. The menu says it comes with pickles but I assumed they would be dill and they most definitely were not. The fries were good as you get a mix of about 4 different types but the presentation doesn't make it very easy to eat and avoid most of them falling to the floor. Definitely disappointed but glas we tried it to find out. Service was good and the patio seating was nice.",

The food and service are usually terrible and they usually have terrible beer selections and watered down cocktails. When our group chose this restaurant we were skeptical but starving so we took a chance. We all LOVED it!!! All the food we ordered was amazing. Great drinks! The service was awesome! The server brought me the wrong dish and when I pointed it out she was very apologetic and the meal I originally ordered was at our table within a few minutes. The manager came out and apologized. They left the food I didn't order at the table so our group could eat it. The manager gave me a free beer. The way it was handled was very impressive! This place was very good and everyone in our group was pretty amazed by our awesome experience.",

Already anticipating the dining choices, I contemplated wearing a full body bib in an attempt stay presentable throughout the rest of the night. Well at least I tried.  In anticipation for the bold and delectable flavors on the horizon, I had keep myself composed and hold back the taste buds from over reacting, leading to a mouth-gasm .   We sat at the bar... Because it looked super cool. The bartenders were helpful and entertaining.  We ordered up some grub. And when I say grub I mean some good quality and generously portioned quality dishes. I can't emphasize how good it was.  For the record, I'm a fan of the Jalapeno Popper and Fieri's are the best I've ever had.  After a great evening of deliciousness, we were off to make it an amazing Vegas night. #DoubleWink  Mr. Fieri, your Vegas spot exceeded my expectations!",

With so many choices I went with one of the most simple meals bbq wings. OMG the sheer simplicity of them were amazing. I loved the sauce. I'm a huge sauce guy and I wanted more I almost wanted to drink the sauce I wanted to order a glass of sauce.   I wanted to order more food and more everything but was trying to keep my meal to $20. So that ended that. But I do realize that everything is more expensive in Vegas. I returned that night to get what turned out to be the best nachos of my life. The brisket nachos I fell in love. The best food experience ever.   Thank you Guy for finding your call in life an chief. The hungry Hawaiian will return.",

Either way the burger is reason enough to visit IMO.   My buddy tried the ribs. Wowie. They are tender and flavorful.

It was a nice day outside, but may choose to sit inside next time.  Las Vegas Blvd right next to it and all the people walking the strip.  And so you know the smells coming off the strip may ruin your appetite lol.  Marijuana scent wafted over a few times and a bad sewer smell was really nasty for like a minute or two.  Ordered the bacon mac n cheese burger and Caesar salad.  The burger was perfectly done.  Juicy and a little pink in the middle.  Never had mac n cheese in a burger but it was awesome!!  The Caesar salad dressing had good flavor, but the salad was drowning in dressing.   Ask for the dressing on the side.  $15.50 for a Caesar salad seems like much since there was no chicken in it.",

Our order took a decent amount a time but not anything unbearable. Boyfriend ordered the double barrel bbq wings and a side of fries. I got the Cajun chicken Alfredo. Wing presentation was nice. Tasted pretty good but not better than other wings at The LINQ and for $16 they should come with a side. The pasta was okay. Chicken wasn't very seasoned and overall I didn't taste much \"Cajun\". The pasta was really comparable to something from Applebee's and definitely not worth the price.  Service didn't enhance the experience at all. Honestly, there wasn't anything special about this place. They do offer bowls of cocktails so that's always appealing to me but I didn't partake. Overall the experience was meh.",

Wait time was 20 minutes, but was closer to 15.  So not bad there.    Once seated, our server came over and took our drink order.  A runner brought one, and the server the other.    My wife went with a salad and shrimp. I went with the Original Ringer Burger.  The salad was good.  The burger was OK.  They didn't ask how I would like it cooked and it came out dry and a bit salty.  I honestly thought I had a better burger at In n Out and Smashburger.  Fries were ok, nothing that stood out.   Service was friendly (aside from the hostess) but felt rushed.  I bet they're trying to turn tables, but this felt like they wanted to get us out ASAP.  I also thought the restaurant wasn't super clean.  Just seemed like the tables could have been wiped better and the floors cleaned of errant food dropping's.    All in all, so-so place to eat.  IMHO, celebrity chef establishments are always a bit of a gamble in Vegas.",

Waitress did nothing about the food to make it right. Then our waitress asks as smoke is pouring into the dining area do you want dessert well you can't have any cause the kitchen caught fire and you should leave. Wow. We asked if she could get us at least a rain check on dessert, she said nope! We decided to just pay the bill and leave but while waiting for her to return she stood by our table for 6 minutes talking to the other waiters then turn to us and tossed our bill with the credit card to our table. I couldn't believe how we were treated. We won't be back!!",

I thought it was gonna be a just a overload of nachos and it was just regular. I can compare this to the nachos in Lucilles. Which are half the price and the same amount and just as delicious. Disappointing, if your gonna charge me 20 for nachos at least make it so I cant finish them.   Service was fine, it was just the amount of money you pay for the amount of food you get is not worth coming here. Save your money and get a better deal somewhere else",

My husband ordered the Mac and Cheese hamburger but with the Mac and cheese on the side. Thank goodness because the Mac and Cheese taste horrible and was also cold. The waitress had to be reminded to bring my glass of wine and my husband said the ice tea was flat. I observed some good looking desserts pass by, but our waitress didn't ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu she just blooped down the $50 bill on our table and mumbled something about Cesar Palace points.",

Another round of Trash Can Nachos please! We made a group decision to sub in their Baja Chicken, but I'd have happily ordered them exactly as the first round. SO MUCH YUM! and of course we got our obligatory video of it all ;) Two of us were Trash Can Virgins and two were Experts as they had at another G.F. restaurant on the Strip a couple years ago.  They thought the others were better which made me wonder if they were in fact slightly different to make each experience unique...only way to know is to go back and test out both places...SIGN. ME. UP!!!!  I ordered a margarita...the VIP Status...but it was on the heels of the best one of the trip (and likely ever!) the night before so I quickly switched to a Tropical Tornado (hello Blue Curacao!) and regretted not having another before we moved on to our next stop.   I feel like we did the menu a disservice by only having the Trash Can Nachos as the menu was extensive and truly something for all tastes. We were salivating over the aromas and presentation of the food being delivered around us and I do want to explore this fun menu more next time.  Kudos to our server, Matthew H, for asking if we wanted the bill split four ways. He was the ONLY SERVER of any of our meals in our 4 day trip that asked this and we loved him for it!",

The Quad is really starting to shape into an attractive Vegas casino.. as long as you don't see their hotel rooms. haha The addition of Guy Fieri's restaurant, along with Hash House, really steps up the food game in this area of the strip..  Food: Going through the menu, there weren't a lot of fancy-shmancy ingredients or toppings.. just your classic all-American foods assembled into fantastic combinations. I decided to go with the Mac+Cheese Bacon Burger.. the ultimate burger throw-up! The patty: very thin but wide, coming out of the burger covering the entire bottom bun.. while the bacon and mac&cheese slightly oozed out on top of the patty. This is the True definition of a \"beautiful mess\". Very tasty burger, loved the 5-cheese mac&cheese and the simple \"backyard BBQ\" grilled type of burger.  The fries that came with the burger came in 3 types: ridged, curly, and wedges.. awesome! We also ordered the Triple-T fries which was like truffle overload with gouda. We didn't get to try any of the specialty cocktails.. there were many interesting concoctions that we'll definitely try next time.  Ambiance: I'd describe it as an Ed Hardy-themed restaurant.. even the napkins had skulls. haha. A lively restaurant with high, exciting energy. If you're there for lunch, definitely sit outside.. you get the view of the walkway between Harrah's and The Quad, and the front of Caesars. I'm not sure how it is at night but probably crazy loud with Harrahs' Carnival court right next door.  Service: Staff was great.. there were two consistent servers continually checking on us. It was a bit of a wait for our food to come out but I give them a little leeway since the restaurant's still brand new.  Tips: Don't pass up this place if you're torn on what to eat on the strip. Grab a burger, a few drinks, and enjoy!",

Well my plate looks like the allowed my steak to rest on the plate and then added the sides and sent it out.  Other than that the food was great. The flavors were good. Oh and the fried ice cream is a must have. It's definitely a sharable item. So save room.",

    "text": "I remember hearing that Guy Fieri had opened a new restaurant in Vegas, and as we were walking by the Quad I saw this place and new I had to try it.  My friends are always willing to try new places so we went in.  There was a pretty long line, which led me to think it would be a long wait, but we were seated shortly after.    We had two waitresses that took care of our table.  One took the order and brought out the food, and the other was for drinks.  This is something new to me, but was glad it worked out great.  I had my drinks refilled my times without having to ask for a refill.    On to the food, our table ordered fireball whisky wings, double barrel bbq wings, triple t fries, and the mac and cheese bacon cheeseburger.   The wings are like a lollipop style so sizes do vary.  Unfortunately, ours were on the smaller size.  We got a wing/pop that was a size of a quarter.  The fireball wings does have a spicy kick to it. Not overwhelmingly spicy but leaves a tingle.  Flavor was pretty good.  The double barrel bbq wing is pretty normal.  The mac and cheese burger was ginormous.  Good luck taking a bite out of this one.  I had to use a fork and knife to eat this burger.   I ordered it medium but it came out well done.  Was not cooked to order.  Wished the mac and cheese would were more cheesy.  Overall, the burger was a bit dry and lacking in flavor.    They have a beer challenge here if you can drink their flight sampler under a certain amount of time, you will win a t-shirt.  We didn't do it because we were already full after eating.  Service is great here even while they are extremely busy. Prices are a little bit on the expensive side for burgers and wings.",

Half way through the burger the bottom bun was completely in pieces. The smothered chili bowl was okay the chili was good but the cornbread lacked flavor.

Maybe it's just us, but we thought the wings and bleu cheese & wasabi dipping sauce weren't spicy at all.  Unfortunately, by the time the runner delivered them, they were pretty much at room temperature.  We didn't care for the wings, but the raw vegetables and dipping sauce were good.  The bartender, Andrew, worked his ass off that night and still remained very courteous and patient with the customers at the bar -  even though some of them were being difficult.  He also did a great job preparing the drinks. For some reason, they tasted better than Michael's versions.  If you think you'll be spending a couple of hours here, the drink tab will add up fast ($12 per drink), so try to go during happy hour for a $4 discount.  Also, if you're a Total Rewards member, present your card for a $1 discount on food menu items.  The 4 stars are mainly for the customer service.",

My favorite burger in LA is Pie and Burger in Pasadena so you can have an idea what I like.  Wifey wanted to hit this up. I had low expectations. We ordered the regular burger (forgot the name but it had BBQ sauce). Now I would normally not get bbq sauce but this burger was tasty. The bread was soft and fresh (so important). The meat was super juicy and not overcooked. Perfect amount of condiments to keep it all moist and together. Loved the different fries on the side. Already seasoned and came out piping hot and fresh. I was so impressed with the burger.  We sat at the bar to avoid waiting. Wifey loved her lemon drop drink and I appreciated the proper Guiness pulls on my draft. Also had the fireball wings. They were okay. Good concept and I love how they cut them up and push em up before cooking like those asian style wings. I'm just more of a fried wing kinda guy. Liked the wasabi blue cheese sauce.  Main point.. Good damn burger. Props to the cooks.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of Guy, so when I happen to be standing right in front of his new restaurant in Vegas, I had to try it. We couldn't settle on just one beer, so we went with the recommendation of the bartender and got the Flight to Flavortown.  It is 16 taster beers. What a great idea.  If you finish all of the beers, you get a free t-shirt.  Of course, I got a free t-shirt.  :) To go with the beer, I wanted to try the lollipop wings that were also recommended. The bartender mentioned that they were not hot, just had a nice kick. She was a liar.  They were on fire hot. Amazing, but hot. I can still taste the sauce.  Served with wasabi, blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, this was a fantastic dish.  I highly suggest having these!",

Four tacos to a plate were about $16. It is the strip so I'm not surprised. The tacos were realllyyyy good especially with the sauces provided. I liked the chicken more than I did the carne. Will definitely be back to try one of those huge burgers that passed me by!!",

My wife had the Turkey sandwich which could not have been more dry, the pretzel bread looked like it had been sitting out for days. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Las Vegas, over priced and not an an ounce of quality.",

Not only was the meal delicious, it was very reasonably priced. But the icing on the cake was the amazing customer service we received. We frequent restaurants on the strip, and Chris was one of the best servers we've had in quite a while. First, he offered to move is to a better table without us having to ask. He made great suggestions on food and drinks, and checked in on us enough/not too much. I love being at restaurants where the staff obviously gets along well with each other. Plus, not only did the manager check in with every table to make sure everyone was happy, I saw him helping out by taking food out to tables when it got a little busier. We will gladly return! Thanks so much to the staff...you guys made it a great experience!",

    "text": "Went in for my daughter's 18th birthday for our for our very first visit. I wanted to see what all the hype about Guy was. My daughter and friends are oddly fascinated and possibly obsessed with going to 'Flavor Town'. We eat out a lot and have high expectations when comes to service and food. Let's just say this visit led to us rerunning the following day with her brothers... It was AMAZING!!! The Mac & cheese bacon burger was delectable... The ranch was out of this world, I cannot even put it into words... Did I mention it was on the Happy Hour menu? Just typing this is making my mouth water, literally. Nice size patty with bacon, lettuce, pickles and a lightly toasted bun... The flavor was unlike any other I had ever had before. The Mac & cheese enhanced those flavors and took this burger to the next level. The fries came with ketchup, BBQ sauce and yes friends, RANCH!!! Also on the happy hour menu was frozen peach Ciroq shots for 9$ I could go on forever, but no worries, I won't. Last but certainly not least was our server, Chris Anderson from Glendora, CA. He was the best server that I've seen and took very good care of us. He made sure we had everything we needed and answered all our questions about the food, restaurant and 'our' new obsession, Mr. Fieri. A real genuine man who made sure our night out as a family was a memorable one. As I mentioned before, we eat out a lot and this is my very first Yelp review. Go check it out and you will be as in love as I am. Thanks, we will be back again to 'turn on our flavor jets'.",

And each time the waitress came the first words that came out of her mouth were \"Thank you for your patience\". Like she had been coached to say that since they apparently have service issues. The food, however, was very good. I'm not sure what spice they use on the fries, but it was soooo good. I got the turkey burger. The mister got the regular burger. Both were huge, and very good. Many turkey burgers at restaurants are dry, but this was not, plus with the custom sauces on it, there were many great flavors throughout. I definitely would say to give this place a try. Just know that it might take a while to get service.",

This place should be on kitchen nightmares. The foods not on par with expectations. I opted for the turkey burger with poblano pepper and two kinds of cheese, but got no poblano, cheese, pickles, bacon and slaw. Disappointed not only with the burger, but with the entire experience. When I asked my server I was told that the pepper was in the burger patty itself. The cocktail I ordered, cucumber and melon should have been cold, instead it was tepid, almost warm and could should have been strained. When my beverage arrived, it was accompanied by a squadron of bar flies. I don't typically write negative reviews but this place needs help. Trevor the manager was nice enough to take care of my tab for the evening. Beware and temper your expectations.",

We were a party of four and asked the waitress Sam to split the check in half. My boyfriend paid with a card and my parents paid with cash. She came back and said she had to run the card first and then the cash. We all thought it was weird but allowed her to continue. My boyfriend tipped generously and signed the receipt and then she came back with change for my parents. Mind you each total was around $65. Later that day my boyfriend found out on his credit card statement that Sam had charged the full amount on the card which makes me wonder if she just pocketed the cash. The credit card company is taking care of it but just be aware and attentive if you decide to eat here. Such a shame because we were really excited for this restaurant and meal.

    "text": "This was our one must-do dining experiences in Vegas for the infamous bacon mac-n-cheese burger.  We waited ten minutes to get on the wait list.  We were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes but only took about 15 minutes probably because of the number of people not willing to wait that long.    Initially service was good, drinks were prompt.  We ordered and waited, and waited.  After 40 minutes, we were informed they were out of turkey burgers and would have to choose something else.  Well, there is not much else on the menu for one that is allergic to hoofed animals.  Finally they substituted unseasoned sliced turkey on the burger.  At that time I communicated my concern about the amount of time we had already waited.  They said they would get right on it and bring it all out.  Fifteen minutes later a server (not our waiter) brought out the food.  It did look amazing, but that's where it ended.  The pulled pork sandwich and bacon mac-n-cheese burger had obviously been sitting in wait of the turkey burger.  Everything was cold and the coleslaw had made the roll completely soggy.  The substitute turkey sandwich was pathetically bland.  I would have mentioned this to our waiter but he became David Copperfield and vanished. We had to flag down other wait staff to ask for something to put on the bland turkey sandwich.  We didn't see our waiter again until he brought out the $80 check for 3 burgers, he never did ask how the food was, I'm sure he knew. They did not even offer menial compensation for substituting as sub-par sandwich in place of a $20 burger.  Very disappointed.",

My hubby and I split an order of the double BBQ wings.  They are lollipop style and had a nice ranch for dipping and the veggies were not just typical celery but radishes, peppers, carrots, etc.  then we had the turkey burger.  It was the best turkey burger we've ever had.  It had smoked Gouda and other fixings.  The fries that came with it were a mix of different fries which was really good.  Ok draft beer selection.  We each had one beer. Good meal for $56 in Vegas!",

Our server, Nick, was awesome - super nice and placed rush on our food so we could get out in an hour and catch our flight. Thanks Nick! The food, on the other hand, was just 'ok'.  I was expecting an elevation of the \"diners, drive-ins and dives\" concept, especially for the price, but what we got was pretty much what you'd expect having watched the show - lots of cheese, deep-fried everything, sauces with names like \"donkey sauce\" (wha?).  I had the chili with cornbread and it was underwhelming. The chili was just ok. I think I make a better one! The cornbread was dry and lacked flavour.  My husband had pulled pork on a pretzel hoagie. The sandwich was big and fairly tasty - definitely the best thing we ordered. The fries - spiced and mildly sweet - were just ok. I would have preferred them to be crispier, and I wasn't crazy about the sweetness. They reminded me of this dive bar in my university town that put powdered onion soup mix on their fries... Maybe that's were Guy got the idea. Overall, slightly disappointing.",

    "text": "OMG! If I simply repeated that expression about 10,000 times it would not come close to the experience that my wife and I had here in Vegas. To start we ordered the Truffle fries. I not sure if you know what a truffle is, but let me paint you a mental picture. A truffle is a fruiting body of a subterranean Fungus! I personally have never been adventurous enough to eat this until now. I really cant even imagine at what point in time someone was digging around in the dirt and unearthed something that looks like a sophisticated cow patty and said to them selves; I am so going to add this to my fries for dinner! All I can say is Chaucer said it best when he coined the phrase \"nothing ventured nothing gained!\" I live in Dallas TX; and I am not kidding when I say I would walk back to Vegas if someone told me Guy Fieri was considering putting his restaurant here but need proof of peoples love of his food. I was in the Marine Corp for 13 years and traveled to 27 different counties around the world and I have experienced an unimaginable amount of diverse foods. Please listen to me when I say without any hesitation that my food experience there in Vegas was nothing short of magical. I know passion when I see it, and this man has a passion for food and it shows up in every bite of food we had the privilege to taste while we were there. I solute you Guy Fieri and all the work you have done to get where you are today, and I thank you for a memorable meal. Semper Fi, Sgt Lewis.",

The good: Attention and service from Christopher was outstanding. Drinks were always filled. Very helpful with the menu. Managers also stopped by frequently to check up on us.  The nachos were the best ever! First, they prepare the dish by spreading out the chips in a single layer and putting all the toppings on every chip before baking. Then they pile the chips onto the serving plate. The effect is that every chip has cheese and toppings on it. No blank chips in the middle and bottom. Plus, tons of flavor on the toppings.  Lettuce wraps were fantastic. Served with chicken cooked two different ways and a flavorful sauce.   The chili was outstanding. Very mild, but served with Sriracha so that you could add heat to your own taste.  The not-so-good: Food was slow coming out. Obviously a kitchen issue, because at every round, the waiter came by to apologize and say the food would be out soon.  The hamburger was just OK. My son said he would prefer a Red Robin burger.",

    "text": "Excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, Guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. I had the Triple T fries and 14-hour Brisket sandwich. The meal was heavily portioned. The truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious. Ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. My suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. Please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions.",

Just really if you're going to charge $2 per wing, they should at least be slightly more than a bite. They were the tiniest wings ever, yet I couldn't finish them because they were so not tasty!  Thankfully someone shared the nachos with me because I was soooo hungry!",

My Daughter visited Guy's place last week and raved about the Trash Can Nacho's. We had beef in  Vegas for 7-Days had some exceptional food, some really bad food and good cheap food. Getting ready to hit the Airport, my Daughter was upset we didn't try it out, so away we went. Friday 2pm not really crowded, but hit the Bar anyways. Greeted quickly with menu asked for drinks we went with water to start until we made up our minds. Starring at Rouge Dead Guy on tap looks delicious, hello bartender, hello totally involved in a conversation with another employee. Finally asked a girl doing dishes for help getting her attention. Oh our draft beer system is down, no beer for you. But we do have Miller Light 24oz can. Ok great, cane out bout 50  degrees. Trash Can Nachos please. Came out bout 30 degrees. Not sure the disconnection but WOW. Off to the Airport for expensive crappy food, Thanks A lot",

They don't take reservations so when we arrived we were told there was a 25 minute wait. We waited. The host was supposed to text us after seating was available but we never were notified so we walked up after waiting and were seated right away.   From the wait we expected it to be busy. Half the seats were empty and some staff members were just standing around. We were pleasantly greeted after we sat down.  I ordered the Mac and cheese burger and husband ordered fireball whiskey wings with a side of truffle fries. Food took a while to get to us but we were slightly distracted by the spicy bloody Mary's. Very very good!   My burger was huge and delicious along with the truffle fries. Burger was a little runny. The wings were satisfactory but did not live up to the menu description.  Definitely worth a second trip for a better experience and more bloody Mary's. They have a brunch we need to check out.",

And the management must have missed the class on customer service.  We were seated outside.  It was 44 degrees and windy.   The overhead heater wasn't providing enough heat and we were not close enough to any of the stand up heaters to get any warmth.   After waiting 30 minutes for our food (after waiting 40 minutes for a table) we were freezing.  Had our coats and hoods and gloves on.  Begged 3 different hostesses to move us inside and they all blew it off and said they couldn't even though there were several empty tables.   I asked to see the manager.  He never appeared.   Had no choice to wait and eat as we had already spent over an hour for this treat.  We love Guy Fierri.    Didn't have great expectations and were less disappointed.  The food was cold in less than 5 minutes.  (Hard to keep food hot outside when it's 40 degrees and breezy).   Verry little chicken in the chicken sandwich.   $5.00 for ice tea and $4.00 for soda and so on.  So disappointed found the manager and asked him To tip the server as we couldn't add 25$ to the $125 bill for freezing    He could not have cared less that we were unhappy.   I couldn't care less if this place closed.   Don't put your name on this poor excuse for a restaurant Guy.",

We ordered the Mac and cheese burger and the chicken tacos. They were thee best entrees I have had in a long time. They were so filling and so delicious. We then decided to do the \"tapped by guy\" beer sampler. It was fun and we even got a free shirt. Our waiter nick was amazing. I would definitely ask for him if we were to go back. He was hilarious and so kind. Love love love this place",

There was a large group of us so we had a bunch of different meals - chili cheese fries disappeared in 3 minutes, the turkey picnic and Mac and cheese burger were OUT OF THIS WORLD. The picnic was not overly sweet with cranberry, had a hint of sweet with almost a horseradish flavor. The fries were a melody of cuts with an excellent seasoning. The pulled pork was absolutely delicious!! So on a whole, my review... Amazing food! Do not miss it!!!!",

I tasted my friends burger with blue cheese and I have never had something more disgusting than that!!!  I tasted the burger with the pastrami and the description on the menu was better than the burger!  I had the chili with corn bread... Marie Callender's is better for half the price.   The food looks great but the taste is not worth the money nor the million calories that Guy's food packs!  There are thousands of places in Las Vegans that are much  better than this place!

Not gonna waste time telling you how long I had to wait to get in, it is completely irrelevant and always will be for any of you who like to always mention stupid things like that in your even stupider reviews of restaurants.    I will make this very simple.  I love food of all types really.  From the worst thing to the foo foo-est thing.  That will tell you where my mind is at.  But bad food is detectable, so know that as well.   With that I say just look at the menu.  If anything on there sounds good to you, you will like it.  Either a bacon mac and cheese burger is amazing, or it's just not your style.  But maybe the turkey sangwich is.  Just read the menu, ask your server if you are confused, and enjoy the splendor that is on it's way to tube town, aka your stomach.",

Maybe, but definitely won't go out of my way.  There are a couple of gut-bomb burgers that I'd like to try because the nachos we had were pretty solid, but I will prepare myself for the inattentive service.  I actually expected better from something with Guy Fieri's name attached to it.  One interesting thing about the beer prices, is that they are generally $7 for a pint, but they had 2 different Sam Adams that were the cheapest beer on the menu for $6 each.  Thank you for missing that one Guy Fieri pricing guy!",

    "text": "Went Sunday evening with a party of ten. Even though I'm a Diamond card holder we waited an hour and fifteen minutes. Got seated outside on the patio which happens to be close to the Harrah's outdoor stage next door. The music was so loud you couldn't hear someone three seats away. The sandwiches are expensive $18, $19, $20. I had the \"Mayor of Flavortown\" which is pastrami on a burger patty with a pretzel bun. Was it good? Yeah, it was pretty good. Was it worth $19? Um, no. It does come with fries which, in my case anyway, were not very hot and were over seasoned to the point that I didn't eat many of them. The trend in Vegas now is to slap a famous chef's name on a place and jack up the price on otherwise close to ordinary bar food. I'd say that sums up my experience here. To be fair, our service was pretty good and, although not quick, the food didn't take an excessive amount of time to come out.",

The mac n cheese burger was dry and tasteless...the burger patty itself was so bland and the Mac and cheese wasn't gooey and had congealed a bit. Not juicy or full of flavor like I would expect for a $20 burger. So many better burgers along the strip, this one was a joke. Won't come back.",

Guy is one of my favorite chefs i know, he's so cool and i love his since of humor. but his menu is lacking to me. its so concentrated which can be good... if the quality can hold up to it. i got the bacon cheese burger and i could have gotten the same thing at half the price 3 blocks down the strip. seasonings were bland and LOTS of grease. the reason your getting 3 starts Guy is because I'm more the sure this restaurant doesn't represent you very well.",

First off - wtf?! 14 bucks for 6 pretzel rods wrapped in pepperoni? Mind you these are the same pretzel rods you get in the 99 cent boxes from Herr's in the grocery store, served with some flavorless cheese concoction. Not impressed. The brisket was a complete and total failure. Tough all the way through and 90% off my meal was the fat cap. I didn't even eat it. I sent it back and just told them to take it off of the tab. I've eaten bbq in a number of places, in various states and I've never seen a worse serving of the stuff - for 34 friggin bucks! If guy fieri doesn't have his name on this place, it would not be successful pulling this crap with poor food quality.",

My mom and I split the spinach artichoke stuffed mushrooms and the veggie burger. My boyfriend got a traditional burger and his mom got the chili. All of us had fries which were way over seasoned and equally overcooked. The stuffed mushrooms ($17) came with about 7 baby bellas that were drowned in what tasted like nacho cheese. Our veggie burger was downright gross. It wasnt hot, was mushy, and lacked in flavor. My boyfriend said the traditional burger was pretty good. His mom's chili looked like canned meat.. Very thick and soppy looking. She said the flavor was decent. Our waiter was sub par, not horrible but nothing special. The only highlight of the trip was that the food came out very fast. But seeing as ours was cold thats not surprising as it was probably already sitting there. We were all so excited for this place and it was a total let down, and NOT worth the price tag at all!",

    "text": "I went here last night and was seated with the waiter named Luis. He was very friendly and pushy when it came to ordering and I asked him about the Mac and Cheese burger and he said he recommended it.  It took him awhile to bring our waters and seeing from the next two tables over, it was clear that he wasn't able to handle his section. He messed up on a few peoples orders and judging by the looks on their faces, it made me worry about my order. When I received my burger, it was horrible. Barely any Mac and Cheese (just a few strands of pasta) and he didn't even ask me how I liked my burger. The burger was too well done for my taste and when I asked him about it, he looked at me like \"what did you want me to do with it?\" He apologized and told me he didn't know and forgot to ask me. This place is supposedly known for their burgers, HOW DO YOU NOT ask a customer how they want their burger?! The burger mostly had stringy pickled lettuce or something, it did NOT go good with the burger AT ALL. Oh and did I mention the burger was $20? I didn't even finish it because it was horrible.  My boyfriend also asked for a plate to split the burger with me, as soon as we got the meal and he never even returned with the plate. We asked for the check and we immediately got that instead. Nice to know that we were getting rid of is my guess.  Please don't go here. The service is HORRIBLE as well as the food. The hype is not at all about what it seems. Go spend your money else where on a decent burger that is cheaper and better.",

We were on our way to another celebrity restaurant when the amazing smell of perfectly cooked beef caused us to round the corner at The Linq & find the entrance. So glad we did. I ordered the Bacon Mac n cheese burger and was delighted. It was big - I managed to eat about 2/3 of it. The side of fries was most interesting- a combination of skinny, crinkle cut, & waffle fries. Seasoned with a spicy blend but the ketchup cut the heat nicely. My friend had the Original Ring burger. She finished it and loved every bite. Come here. Seriously - don't miss it.",

I was very disappointed that it didn't even come out all that hot as the cheese was not melted and the bacon was black. Turns out the bacon is Cajun and had decent flavor but again not hot. The turkey burger itself had no flavor and whatever the donkey sauce is was one tiny squirt that brought nothing to the dish. My friend had a burger and she said it was good...and she also got twice as many fries as I did. I am a fry whore...I love them...and eat them even when they aren't all that good...like at this place. Just another famous name on a mediocre restaurant.",

    "text": "After striking out at Chayo (also in the Linq), we settled on going to Guy Fieri's restaurant because it was close, open late, and we were all hungry and wanted to try it.  I'll admit that I went in to this with high expectations, so maybe that lent to the fact that I found the entire place...underwhelming.  The decor is all right...kind of exactly what you would expect, and the servers are nice enough, even if they are a bit slow.  It was relatively busy, so I'm willing to overlook the slow pace of service.  The food, however, was just mediocre.  I think all four of us expected something more.  HUGE portions and HUGE flavor were expected.  The portions lived up to expectations, but unfortunately the food didn't.    I ordered the mac n cheese burger and while it was pretty large, the mac n cheese on it was very bland and the bacon was kind of chewy.  A friend ordered the fireball chicken wings and the wings were small, and it only came with 7 wings.  Another of us ordered the cajun chicken sandwich.  Here is where you would really expect some big flavor, but it was just so-so.  My fiance ordered the ribs (33 bucks for a rack...not too bad for a strip restaurant with a famous dude's name attached) and those were definitely the best thing on our table.  They were tender and smoky and had a lot of flavor.  The rack of ribs came with cornbread that was pretty dry and normal...nothing special, and a small cup of the same bland mac n cheese that was on my burger.  We also ordered the Vegas Fries to share as a table...those were actually pretty tasty.  I'd love to give this place more stars but it just doesn't live up to any expectation we had going on.",

    "text": "This was another scouting exhibition for some incoming company who are staying near the linq. I have visited about 40 of the Diners, Drive-ins & Dives lists so I thought at the very least he could have taken the best parts of those and incorporate them into his place here in Vegas.  Eh.   The intent was to have a belated birthday bloody mary with a friend here for a convention at the hard rock. I should have just gone with my gut & met them at the round bar.   The bloody mary came loaded with vegetables like the standard celery, olives & a jalepeno for a little kick, pearl onions & oddly a pickle. I asked if they had cucumbers - they did not. I guess I was supposed to imagine a pickle as a cuke.  *more on the bloody below*   Anyway we were sipping our drinks trying to decide on what to eat .. now I have to say in their defense it was a Friday night AND it was close to midnight but we waited.   and waited.   and waited.   I got 1/2 way though my bloody mary - it was 'thick\" as bloody mary mixes go and I was full. NOW I'm a fat girl - so you know I have the capacity to suck down 2/3/4 bloody marys and go on. I had lunch leftovers at 5 so by now I should be ready to eat an arm.  I think the mix was so thick it filled up that giant cavity that is my belly.   Anyway she finally came back over we just got the check. I think our waitress was trying for the Wednesday Addams sullen look but more surly than sullen. Not like they had a line up outside the door.    **** for FA seating & ample room between tables.  ** for Wednesday Addams surly service.   When the dead time comes again aka 2 weeks before Christmas we might go back to actually have a meal and check out the food.",

Once she recognized we were there she began to help but took about a minute to gossip with a co-worker about how guy's kids were on the patio, poor service.  Once we were sat we we simultaneously over and underwhelmed by the good on the menu. I ordered a local beer, actually this place has a decent list considering it's location. We ordered buffalo potato things that came with wasabi buffalo sauce, seemed right on par with what we expected. My wife wanted a glass of wine but they were SOLD OUT of wine...wtf? How do you sell out of wine?   All in all this place gets 2 stars for local beer, and a nice, while overworked waitress. I would never go here again.",

The late-night menu had a Mac & Cheese Burger that sounded awesome for about $14.  I think that they lowered the prices a notch since opening, a good move since it was otherwise a bit overpriced.

As you walk by Guys outdoor seating you can see the big burgers on display, this attracted me and my wife to try this place out.   We called for reservations, none taken, we put our name down at about 6pm on Saturday Night 25 min wait. Our server was attentive, took our order right away, our food came within reasonable time. I ordered the Triple B $16 burger and my wife ordered the mac and cheese bacon burger $18 burgers come with fries. The food came out hot, big plus for me. My first bite of the triple B was very flavorful then it went straight to salty. I could not enjoy this burger too much because they seemed to put a lot of blue cheese in the burger. I like blue cheese but it was so strong I could not taste any steaky flavor from the meat. Also the other add-ins seem to overpower the burger as well donkey sauce. The burger was just too salty for me I ate half of it; removing as much bleu cheese as I could.  My wife enjoyed her mac n cheese burger the bacon in both burgers was very tasty. We both enjoyed the fries they add a cajun spice to them. Not sure we would be back did not leave a lasting impression on me. I recommend anyone trying them out to share a burger. They are big enough for two people, especially if you plan to hit the club at night dont want to over stuff yourself. The price was ok for the strip, try em you may enjoy these burgers on steroids.",

My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here.   This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot.   My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to.",

I ordered the \"Dragons Breath Chili Cornbread Benedict\" (Sweet cornbread topped with Dragon's Breath Chili, house white cheddar cheese sauce, scallions, & 2 poached eggs.)  This modern interpretation of Eggs Benedict was outstanding. It is over-the-top, but approachable.  It is more than enough of a meal, especially when coupled with their fantastic customized Bloody Mary.  My companion had the Maple Bacon French Toast (House baked brioche soaked in maple syrup custard & griddled in brown butter, topped with dark maple syrup, candied bacon & bruleed banana).  It, too was great.  The service was flawless, and the atmosphere is perfect.    Two thumbs up!",

When the wings came out they were room temperature and the presentation of the nachos was very unappealing. We didn't finish either appetizer (& didn't order any more food) as it lacked any exceptional flavors and hit our stomachs immediately like a ton of bricks. Upon leaving the restaurant, we made it 10 minutes before both of us had to use the bathroom. Beyond disappointed and definitely would never go back or recommend!",

    "text": "The best meal I had in vegas by far! Wow where do I start with this place, my gf had been asking to go here all weekend and after partying at Wet Republic we decided it was about time for our first meal of the day. The restaurant is located at The Linq which is on the strip, it was not very difficult to find which was a relief. The line was already formed when we arrived but as usual parties began to leave due to not wanting to wait and we were seated in about 15-20 minutes outside with prime seating to watch the final four NCAA game.  The first thing that came as a pleasant surprise was then having dead guy ale which is one of my favorite beers. We decided to start our meal with the pepperoni wrapped pretzel sticks with fondu dip. Holy god was this good, I can't even explain how delicious this was, perfect mix of textures with the pep and cheese with the crunch of the pretzel, by far my favorite part of the meal. For my entree I went with what was highly recommended, the Mac n cheese burger. Once again, perfect, medium made burger that was packed with juiciness and flavor. The Mac n cheese was great and with some hot sauce it was ecstasy in my mouth. Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water. You have to check this place out while in Vegas, in my eyes it is worth the wait, I would've waited over an hour and thought it was worth it, highly recommended!",

    "text": "Here's my two cents of this place:  Being a fan of the \"Triple D\" show I was happy to find Guy's place at the LINQ. Although, I really wanted to like this place I couldn't get myself to give this place a rating higher than 2 stars.  To be fair we were headed to The Hash House but had to leave because the wait was over an hour for breakfast. Looking for an alternative we walked by Guy Fieri's Food and decided to drop in. There wasn't a line and we were seated right away. On the recommendation of the waiter I ordered Chicken Fried Bacon, eggs on a buttermilk biscuit with country gravy. The waiter described the Chicken Fried Bacon as a thick cut bacon battered like a chicken fried steak. So I thought thick cut bacon, who wouldn't like thick cut bacon? When the plate came out it looked good. However, after I took my first bite it wasn't what I was expecting. The bacon wasn't thick cut, it was a regular piece of bacon that was covered in a lot of batter and deep fried. After the first bite I peeled off all of the batter from the bacon. The biscuit was huge and dry. The flavor of the biscuit was good but was too dry, so much so I could only eat 1/2 of one side. The eggs were over done and not seasoned. The country gravy had good flavor but didn't have any sausage or ham in it. To top it all off the service was slooooow. I couldn't understand why it took so long to take our order (the breakfast menu isn't very big), bring out drinks and deliver the food. The place wasn't very busy at all but the service seem particularly slow.  Overall the food wasn't and service weren't  good. The price was way too high even for a strip hotel restaurant.  Although, I wouldn't recommend this place or go back for breakfast, I'll keep watching the show.  Happy Eating.",

The salad was nothing, but a little cheese and very hard croutons, and the mac and cheese tasted like it came out of the velveeta box.

Food was good and no complaints.  Reason for the one star is the horrible hostess staff...they should all be replaced immediately!  They were not engaging or excited to be working and it seemed like it was a chore to seat people. Just one example is that they seated a gentlemen who was in a wheelchair at a high top that has no support for him.

    "text": "I really was hoping to like Guy Fieri's restaurant.  It is not bad, by any means.  It is a good burger.  The food is good.  The decor is good. The service is good.  But that is the problem.  It's all just \"good.\"  There was nothing that will make me want to go back.  I have been to Burger Bar (quite a few times), as well as Gordon Ramsey's burger place at PH.  I have to say that Burger Bar is quite a bit better.  The prices are comparable, but the fact of customization you can do at Burger Bar made it better for me.  The prices were average for Vegas, but high for a burger place located anywhere else.  What I liked the best about Guy Fieri is that fries come with the burger, and they give you a variety of all the fries.  A great idea and very much appreciated.  If you are in the mood to splurge on the K-cals, go ahead and give Guy Fieri a try.  Unfortunately, it just didn't blow my mind for an amazing meal.",

We got the Parmesan garlic kind.  The burger w/Mac cheese was so-so but not bad at all.   3 stars because he failed on the smores dessert! It seemed like a big slab of carb infused with not so chewy marshmallows and chocolate sauce...I didn't taste any graham cracker at all because it was all fried up and was really soggy. Definitely a big fat \"F\" more like epic fail!  All in all pretty cool spot for bar bites!",

I expected much more from a restaurant that Guy Fieri owns. So here it goes..food is terrible. You're better off making your own breakfast or going to Ihop. . We ordered the French toast and the egg & sausage plate. Both were not good at all. The only thing we enjoyed were the mimosas. Not a great place to kick off your Vegas stay. My advice, they need to hire experienced chefs who are able to cook breakfast!!!",

The food was decent, had the Vegas fries for an appetizer-which were spicy but in a good way and a nice decent portion. I ordered the brisket nachos which were awesome, however my boyfriend and his friend each ordered a sandwich and they were both small and left lots to be desired.  My problem with this restaurant was the service. It was slower than I've ever had, well ever. We asked for waters which didn't arrive until after our appetizer was half eaten (about 30 minutes from when we sat down) and we wanted to order alcoholic beverages but we barely saw our server after we ordered our appetizer and meals. What should have been no longer than an hour lunch took almost 1.5 hours by the time we were able to get our server to come over to pay the bill and even longer to get our change.",

Burgers are sloppy looking or burnt, and at $20 a burger, you expect better quality. Service is still sub par but I expect this on the Strip now sadly. Also, Guy always offered a discount to locals in his restaurants and now this is gone. If the management can improve quality, I'll go back. Until then, there are plenty of other places to choose from for the price point.",

The two beef patties were masterfully placed between two artisan created pieces of toast. Accompanying this sandwich was Guy's Ragin Flamin' splooge sauce that added subtle notes of hickory and leather.  2) \"Guy's Mozzarella Sticks\" were truly out of this world...possibly in the next universe. White cheese resembling mozzarella was delicately coated with a bread crumble that Guy calls Pano de coto. Simply outsanding!  3) \"Le Chicken Dubenaise\" was the star! A fully cooked chicken was presented table side and the waiter sliced each piece to your liking. It was then served with the most delicious Dubenaise sauce I have ever had.

Waited for what it seemed like forever for the burger. It came out just barely warm. We ordered medium it was more like well done. It tasted alright but graffiti junction has done a better job with their burgers. If you want an overpriced \"alright\" burger, go to Guy's. You'll spent $20 on a burger and leave a bit disappointed.

That is a common problem with celebrity restaurants.. they sell you the celebrity thing, not the food (nor decent pricing!). I avoid the celebrity places like Dracula and garlic.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and had to wait about 15 minutes (this was CES week after all). Our waitress showed up quickly and we had drinks in a matter of minutes. Perfect.  We ordered appetizers (GUY-TALIAN FONDUE DIPPERS and BRISKET NACHOS) , both were excellent, very flavorful and large portions, suited for a table of four.  Then orders of the Original Ring Burger and the Mayor of Flavortown Burger. Both amazing, but extremely \"heavy\", I would guess one GigaByte of calories each.  To finalize the adventure in fat nirvana, we got the GUY'S CHEESECAKE CHALLENGE, huge and excellent.  We really liked the experience, although a bit on the heavy side. It is a fun place to have great eats and mingle with friends, and escape the overpriced staples of the big casinos.  Cheers!",

Our order took a long time before it finally made it to our table.  When the food arrived  buffalo fries were cold and the burger was lukewarm. Both items were good but they would've been much better have they been served hot.  We can now say we've been there and done that but we won't return nor would we recommend it unless you just want to say you went to one of Guy's restaurants.",

They changed the policy to no outside drinks so had to chug 2 tall cans to be seated. They seated us behind this brick wall in between 2 main rooms and I should've asked to be moved already which was my fault. Server came over after 10mins and finally took our drink orders (water) and bam left without asking if we need more time with the menu or appetizers maybe even when the menus were closed and we were ready. Ordered the wings and a Mac n cheese burger. Got our food and the wings were dry with little to no meat. The burger was overcooked and falling apart looking like they used the last of the ground beef for it. Waited for water refills and haven't seen our server for 15mins now and had to ask the bus boy for waters and some ranch after I specifically asked for ranch instead of the blue cheese from our server. Watched our server Johnathan walk by us 5-10 times and finally got the bill from the bus boy AGAIN. Walking to the front to complain one of the hostesses said \" oh you can take care of that at your table\" I said I know but I'd like to speak to a manager and she got attitude after that and walked away. This experience we only spoke to our server once when we ordered the food. After that he never came back until we were leaving and he said \" have a nice day\" haha what a joke this place is.",

For a restaurant hosted by a Food Network Star, I was not impressed..  We ordered the Fireball wings, the Vegas fries, and the brisket nachos. The nachos were okay, the meat was nicely cooked and the flavors were balanced. The cheese sauce made it seem a little on the cheap side. The fries and the wings had the same 'cheap Franks hot sauce' taste and I didn't like either. The fries were drenched in this sauce and had blue cheese to boot and were BEYOND salty. The wings were breaded and also had the same sauce - with the name \"fireball\" i was expecting something much more sweet and the same thing happened when I bit into them as when I bit into the fries: my lips puckered up from the overuse of SALT..  The staff was okay, not super friendly or quick when it came to drinks, food, refills...anything really.  Cost: EACH appetizer was over $15. For the price and after the taste trial, we were pretty disappointed. I know that it is off of the Strip, but I expected at least the wings to be crispy and flavorful.  I wouldn't take anyone back here who was here to visit our town, I would rather go to a smaller local restaurant that put more love into their food than this restaurant did... I am sure it's not a reflection of Guy himself, but all-in-all it was not a good experience.",

ANyways, I've been to a few great places but had to wait about 30-45mins in line however this place has never had a line!  I've tried the majority of things on the menu including their pancakes that are stuffed with berries (makes me drool thinking about it). I've had their burritos and pretty much tried everything else on the menu from my friend's plates. The portions are huge and the food is delicious, you really can't go wrong. You can choose to sit inside or outside and the atmosphere is very vegasy.   Tip: Come hungry or split a few plates.",

In short, everything was very average, with no standouts at all...not even the appetizers (which were VERY stingy on portion size)   Initial contact was okay, but waiting for someone to come to the table and take our orders was a lot longer than it should have been, especially considering that the majority of staff were just lounging about by the bar, on their phones and chatting because they were bored. Most never even looked in our direction or smiled. Apparently, what they were doing was much more absorbing and important than paying any attention to us.    The place was practically empty, yet we were seated in an area that made it hard to flag down any staff (as no one was walking around), and also made us apparently invisible to them.  When we finally got our food, my partners burger seemed okay, but she didn't look super happy about it.  My burger somehow came out overcooked, yet only lukewarm. I did get a replacement which was better, but by then, I had already stopped caring. I took two bites, and left it there, not even wanting to take it home.   IMHO, unless you're from the middle of nowhere, have never traveled to or eaten anyplace than where you live, and have no clue what actual good food tastes like (ie: a trip to Golden Corral is saved for special occasions, as it's a step up from the usual crap you eat), then you'll be disappointed.  Personally, I will NOT be returning.",

We waited about 20 minutes or so and were seated, more than reasonable for a weekend evening. Menu has a nice, wide variety of options. The Ms. ordered The General's (Tso) Wings and I (putting my vegetarianism quest *way* aside) opted for the \"Off-Da-Hook Original Smashburger, replete with Guy's \"bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce\".  The burger was fine. Well-cooked and well-seasoned, but it's not going to make me crave beef any time soon. The BBQ sauce was a nice touch, though - had some real kick to it. I also liked how the accompanying fries were kind of a hodgepodge - had some waffle, crinkle, and shoestring all mixed in. Wife thought the wings were flavorful but a bit too salty to fully enjoy.   The desserts looked pretty good, but we were so full off the entrees alone that there was no way we would/could stuff ourselves like that.   Overall, four stars from me. Liked the ambience, wait staff was friendly, and not a long wait for the entrees. Would we go back? If we're hanging out around the Linq, quite possibly. Might have to snag a bottle of that BBQ sauce, at least.",

First - The wait was very long. I realize that's to be expected, but it is still noteworthy as one of the reasons for the wait is the name on the restaurant.  Second - We were seated outside after it had just rained. Everything was soaked and one waiter slipped and spilled an entire tray of food because of the dampness.  Third - We were seated outside and it WAS COLD. They had big heaters going, but they weren't enough to cut the chill out of the air.  Fourth - The food was average. Definitely nothing special despite the high prices and popularity of the restaurant. Also, the fries (which everyone raves about) just plain sucked. They were soggy and not appitizing.",

My server was really friendly and had me set up with a cool glass of water and a menu as soon as I sat down. I had been eating poorly the last few days so decided to go with the appetiser Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Holy crap this dish was HUGE and so delicious! The chicken was tender, the mince was delicious and the sauces were all different and blended in perfectly with the mint leaves and other Asian influenced herbs that were in the dish. Definitely not what I was expecting, I thought I might have to order more before I saw how big the serving was. I also got a Cucumber cross Watermelon Cocktail which was super refreshing. Food was reasonably priced and I wish I was here with a few more people so I could return and try some more things on the menu! Definitely check this restaurant out... but sit at the bar.",

If I had to rate the entrees in order it would have to be: Sriracha wings, cajun chicken alfredo then the lobster tacos. The Sriracha wings were amazing! It had the right amount of spice to it; not too hot or over powering. The chicken alfredo was very rich and creamy. Penne pasta was al dente and the chicken was cut up nice in bite sizes which I liked. Last but not least, those lobster tacos... Honestly, I could have done without them. You have to eat them while they are hot. Once they are cold they are not as good. As far as taste, it was good however, the lobster tail to slaw ratio was uneven. I would have preferred an equal amount of lobster tail in the taco. The pink chili mayonnaise was very tasty and added flavor to the dish. I would definitely come back and eat again as well as try other dishes.",

    "text": "Has guy ever really eaten here? It's AWFUL! First we get seated and server after server walks by us, no one greets us, no one acknowledges at all for like 15 mins meanwhile every table around us that has been sat after already has drinks and is ordering. I asked to see a manager who was very professional and apologetic and comped is drinks and trash can nachos. The one star is for her she was very nice.   The nachos were so overrated. This is when the internet hypes things it shouldn't. They didn't have a ton of toppings. The brisket was meh and our jalapenos were rotten. Good thing they were free because $20 for these is a rip off.  I had the cucmelon drink and my husband had the mojito. They were good, better because they were free I wouldn't have paid $15 each for them.  Hubby got the mac and cheese burger. It had no flavor and the meat was like burned. It was just a big pile of calories. The fries I think were supposed to be a mix of different types, but to me just seemed like the bottom of the fry basket. I really like fries and these I hand a small handful and passed on.   Our original waitress finally showed up like 20/25 mins in and made up a lie about something having happened that she was attending to. We realized she was the waitress at the table next to us and had walked by us at least 3 times bringing the guy next to is multiple drinks. It was clear she just didn't know we were her table so she ignored so, so just say that you don't have to lie to our faces.  I would have been level 10 mad if we had paid the True value of approx $80/90 for this meal. I was still annoyed at the $25 for my husbands burger meal. Seriously get a burger at in n out instead and get happy hour nachos from yard house. Both significantly better and cheaper.   Guy I don't think I can trust you anymore this food was awful!",

    "text": "Came here with my significant other on a Monday for a late lunch. There was no wait time and we were seated right away. I had ordered the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger, which I must say was quite delicious. Patty was well seasoned and juicy, mac n cheese was oozing out of the burger, pickles gave it a nice citrusy kick and the string-like onion rings gave it a nice crunch! It's a heavy meal, kept me full for hours and if you plan on a night of drinking it's the perfect pre drinking meal! Now as for the quad fries that came on the side, definitely a bit of a let down as I love fries! They were dry and bland and quite underwhelming when paired with such a flavorful burger. My honey and I must have arrived at a perfect time because as we were stepping out after completing our meal there was a line forming that was starting to lead out the door.",

    "text": "Guy Fieri's was on my list for Vegas, but we didn't intend to come here. Fact was, this place was open during brunch time and didn't have an hour+ wait. And I also saw a platter of food go by and decided that we weren't going to wait a minute longer to dive right into that. So we came here.   So if you've ever seen Guy Fieri's shows, you'll associate the guy with indulgence: hearty portions, rich sauces, thick cuts of meat, deep fried goodness, etc. That is what I was expecting to eat when I came here. The menu is great at selling itself; everything sounds amazing. But the food was hit or miss.  Trash Can Brisket Nachos: these looked sad to me. These were not Guy Fieri's nachos. He would not eat these. He would tell them to put some toppings on there. The meat was strategically placed in one area and then nothing. Nacho cheese sauce was on five tortilla chips. Pico de gallo was just cut tomatoes, no onions, cilantro, or chilies. BBQ sauce was okay. $19 for something that was small compared to everything else I saw in the restaurant. Hard pass.  I got the Double-Barrel BBQ wings because I was trying to resist having yet another burger after having a crap burger the night before and looking forward to a dinner at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR later that evening. I done did wrong. I do appreciate that my wings were actually all drumettes, but this was a small portion. The sauce was good, but it wasn't lick-your-fingers good. The dipping sauce ran out super fast; this should definitely come with a larger serving of ranch. The presentation was awfully cute, but way too neat and pretty for what I expected. I wanted a platter of wings slathered in sauce that would leave my face, hands, and potentially shirt stained. Good, but not great. B rating.   Motley Que Sandwich. I was looking at this fucker for ages before deciding to be a schmuck and get the BBQ wings, and boy did I regret it when this beast landed in front of my friend. THIS SANDWICH IS WHAT GUY FIERI WOULD BE PROUD OF. What the fuck was I eating? Luckily my friend is a cool dude and let me have multiple bites of his sandwich. Incredible. Fuck the rest, get this. Also, MIXED FRIES. I love surprise curly fries! YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT, TOO.   Cheesecake Challenge: yes, my friend got cheesecake for brunch. The pictures make it seem huge, but it's smaller in person. Actual cheesecake part was very good, but I've definitely had better. The crust was stale. The chips were stale. The pretzels were stale. Major MEH moment. My friend was super disappointed with his choice, but at least he can say that he tried it. Between you and me, the Smores Monte Cristo looked AMAAAAZING, but nobody wanted to listen to me. Tsk tsk.   Service was a little sluggish, but overall decent. I got refills once and we got our bill after flagging our man down. He offered to split the check for us, which was awesome. But that's pretty much that.  I guess it really depends on whether or not you luck out with A) little to no wait, B) the right server, and C) the right food choice here. I could see myself having an awesome time here if only we had chosen better options. I'm looking at you, Motley Que!",

The menu is kind of sparse. We waited 15 minutes for a table. When we got in, it was only about half full? Ok I guess *shrugs shoulders*  We ordered the trash can nachos because everyone said they were amazing. Meh they were ok. Too much cheese. The brisket was flavorful, but sweet which was super odd. There needed to be something else less heavy to balance out the nachos. They were nicely loaded with the brisket, but nothing to write home about. Definitely not as good as Nacho Daddy. I think the hype of them falling out of a trash can is the best thing about them.   The burgers were hit and miss. I loved mine. I had the original.  The onion ring was great but again the sweet sauce was weird. My daughter's was burnt. She did not enjoy it. My son didn't like his at all. So I guess this is not up for a repeat visit.",

It's not like Guy was in the kitchen destroying my diner. Since it was so expensive, I had a plan! I would \"mooch\" from my family.    I got the Ceasar salad: bland and the sourdough wedge was brick hard. Second, the fondue dippers were not the greatest. The sticks with bacon bits for the dippers were good, but the fondu was flavorless (not worth $17). I then tried my daughter's steak: tough and dry ($30)...FML. There was a saving grace, the steak sandwich...AMAZING! Tender steak, sauteed green and red peppers, and tangy mayo! Nice!  Fries were avaerage filler BS! Not what you would expect from Guy's. I did find out, the Linq Casino is licensing his name, and its not really Guy's food!  Then we ended with the cheesecake: store bought BULL! I couldn't believe they charged $15 for junk!  Needless to say, we won't be going back. SMH",

S'mores Monte Cristo - ooey gooey buttery goodness   Triple Doublemint Pie - skip it...hard as a rock  Guy's Cheesecake Challenge - half a cheesecake with pretzels, chocolate sauce, and potato chips...I was not up for the challenge  If you haven't been - GO!

    "text": "Guy took to us to flavor town, however the service made us want to skip town!!!   Our personal table server was great. Kind and attentive. We had asked at the beginning of the meal about using our food and beverage credit. The two rooms we had were booked under a friend who had flown home in the morning, but my name was also listed on both rooms. We asked the server if that would be okay- and if we could use the credits from both rooms. He told us that was possible.   We ordered the lobster bites and nachos and LOVEDDDD both.   Unfortunately when it came time to pay the server took my ID and sent the manager CHAD over. Apparently I was listed on the room but as I was not the primary I was not authorized to charge to the room. The group of us kindly tried to explain that we had asked the server before the meal and were told that was fine. He responded in the snappiest of tones and asked what we didn't under stand about not being the primary. Again we told him we asked before we ordered dinner and he said the server had no way to check it it would work or not until ringing us out. When we expressed that that was not fair because they never told us that and we deliberately checked before we ordered. CHAD then aggressively grabbed the check off the table and crumpled it up and said \"Don't worry about it. Have a great rest of your trip\" and walked away. While that may sound kind it was with a TON of sarcasm and turned all of us off. That wasn't what we wanted whatsoever- but with his aggressive storming off we couldn't even express that. We just wanted to find a way to use our room credits.",

I am local and it was pretty easy to park and find the restaurant.",

When I asked to speak to a manager he said, \"We migrated to a new system a couple days ago and the prices must not have been input correctly.\" Though he did credit to the correct amount he seemed irritated and quickly dismissed the issue and walked away. With the name of a celebrity chef attached to this restaurant, I would like to believe there would have been a bit more severity given to the issue- at the very least a sincere apology. How many thousands of dollars have they been incorrectly charging their customers? Check your bill- shady stuff going on.",

Our server was nice and knowledgeable, offering recommendations. We ordered a BIG drink, and then our food. The drink was good. Then the food came after a while of waiting. My wife's brisket nachos were average, but my \"best burger in Vegas\" was cold. Along with the fries. I brought this up to our server, and he took it away. 10 minutes later he arrived with a new burger, albeit warm, was bland and not worth the $20. We also hardly saw our server after that. The bus boy kept our drinks full. When it came time for the check I was shocked to see no discount or anything for the cold burger. Nothing. No apologies. I'm not one to complain, but if I'm at a \"celebrity chef's\" restaurant paying a premium for the food I expect more. We were way underwhelmed and left us feeling robbed and bummed going into our last night. Save your money and go to Hash House. You'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "I'll start out by saying I love Guy Fieri. Unfortunately that's about all I loved about his Vegas restaurant. I went in with high hopes and was wildly disappointed. We started with the vegas fries, this was the best thing we had. The fries- a cross between a curly fry and a thick chip- were very crispy. They were served with a spicy sauce you could drizzle on yourself. I liked the level of heat, but my boyfriend found them too spicy. On the side for dipping was a blue-sabi sauce (blue cheese and wasabi) which was pretty good with spice from the wasabi and a nice cooling effect from the blue cheese.   From there it was all down hill. I ordered the Tatted Up Turkey Burger with a side Caesar. First off, the side Caesar had a home made dressing that wasn't nearly reminiscent of the classic. It tasted almost like straight mayo which was not pleasant.   As for the burger, the patty, though juicy and well cooked, was 2x the size of the bun which made this extremely challenging and messy to eat. The bun-a garlic buttered pretzel bun, sounded good, but it couldn't stand up to all the ingredients in this burger. I also got no garlic butter flavor, if anything the dough itself tasted a little sweet. Inside was poblano peppers and pepper jack cheese which got completely lost, I didn't taste these at all. There was also Gouda cheese, which I could see melted but again it got lost in all the ingredients. The main flavor overpowering everything was the sweet pepper jam. There needed to be a lot less of this to let the other flavors shine. There was however very crisp bacon on this which was it's only redeeming component.   Overall I was really disappointed in this meal. I do wish in retrospect I had tried the trash can nachos which looked pretty good on someone else's table. But from what I got, I would honestly not go back- sorry Guy, still love you though!",

The place was packed and we had about 20 minute wait. We were able to walk around the shops at the Linq promenade to burn some time. When we returned there was a table ready for us. The server greeted us and offered to bring ice water right away. He recommended the bacon Mac n cheese burger as it was the best selling entree. My wife ordered the burger and I got the Motley-Que pulled pork sandwich. The food came out pretty quickly and we were in shock at how big the portions were (see pics). The burger was juicy and Mac n cheese was just right. The Motley-Que was an impressive sandwich  and you will definitely get your hands messy with this beast of a sandwich. The pull pork was tender and I liked the fact they gave me some of the bark of the pork which is the most flavorful part. We were only able to eat about half the burger and sandwich and got it to go.  Price wise it's not the cheapest bar food but the large portions justified the $21.50 price point per order. The server and bussers were excellent and refilled our waters periodically.  Overall great experience and nice atmosphere here. The employees were all dressed in cowboy and cowgirl outfits. Will definitely come back to try something else in the menu.",

    "text": "A few of the items were pretty freaking delicious but not the best grub in Vegas, but worth the stop if you're a fan. Our favorite item was the trash can nachos, actually delivered to your table inside a metal trash can on a plate, fun display :)  They lift the lid to expose all of the layered cheesy, brisket goodness then lift the trash can, allowing the nachos to pour out the bottom onto your plate. Definite must share! There are a lot of nachos in that can!  The Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger by far was an awesome display and not just in looks, but the wonderfully seasoned beef and fries lived up to hype. And if you love mac & cheese, get a side of it to share too (not on the menu). However, I recommend getting the fried onions on the side (think they're out of a can, not fried in-house). A couple crisps are good with a bite but mixing them all in overpowers the mac & cheese yumminess.   Now for the disappoints. We were really underwhelmed by the Pepperoni Fondue Dippers ... so not hype worthy. The dippers were simply pepperoni flavored chewy breadsticks - NOT wrapped in pepperoni as advertised or in \"some\" Yelp pics. Booooooooo for not telling fans when ordering that they're getting end of night leftovers. And the drinks were meh.. a few can be seen in pics, served in water glass without any real presentation or umph. Plus no copper tins for the mules which was a bit of a bummer.    Fun for a one time visit to check off the list but there are way better options if in town for a limited on time.",

    "text": "Mmmmmm.........I want to tread lightly because I don't want to tick off Guy's fans and I like the ole boy myself. Oh well, here goes.  This restaurant is new to me as I haven't stayed at Harrah's in a couple of years and this is located right outside going into the The Linq Hotel and Casino next door. Every time I walked past the place it was slam full as most restaurants in Vegas are; especially the celebrity chef restaurants.   I swore I wasn't going to go but on the last day I decided to give it a shot. Place doesn't open until 9 which is fine for Las Vegas but bad for Jeff. Damnit, I was hungry but luckily, the wife keeps mini chocolate bars in her purse for just such occasions when I get hangry and start to hulk out.  9:05 and the three young ladies at the stand still weren't letting us in. Should have took this as a sign but I didn't. Already committed so I stayed the course. Once in and were finally waited on, I went with the simple breakfast platter which included a biscuit (?), eggs, bacon, apple sausage, and roasted potatoes with red peppers and onions.   The reason for the question mark on the biscuit is cause it didn't look like any biscuit I ever saw but it tasted alright. Downside about it was that it was stone cold. More about that later. As far as the rest of the meal, eggs are eggs, apple sausage was fantastic, bacon was so-so, and the potatoes were delicious.  Now the wife. She went with the biscuit and gravy. The best part of this meal was the country fried bacon. That's right, country fried BACON. The rest of it: I've had way better biscuits and gravy for a third of the price. Gravy was bland and the biscuit was cold.  We asked our server why our biscuits were cold, figuring it was that way per the chef's (Guy) instructions. He stated that they were supposed to be hot. Also, he told us that they were not prepared fresh every day. After enlightening us to this little tidbit, the manager came out to talk with us. Why, I have no idea. He told us that heat lamp on the food may have not heated the entire meal.  If my meal is being prepared fresh, It shouldn't have that much time to cool out from under a lamp. Well, they offered to reheat it but that's about it. Not much in the way of compensation after paying $17 for biscuits and gravy.  I have to say, the whole meal was a little pricey even by Vegas standards and I don't have a problem paying the high prices if the food is worth it but just wasn't for us. Hopefully it's just a coincidence but I'm afraid I won't be taking another chance next time I'm in town.",

I've been wanting to write a review for the last 7 months but haven't really gotten around to it since I'm lazy. BUT our server was a guy named Nick and he is the reason for the 5 star review, the place was also great, but I really just appreciate good service. Literally the most basic things are what are causing me to write this. Nick, first off, he actually introduced himself, which never happens in restaurants anymore. Second, when we ordered alcoholic drinks, he also brought waters without us asking! This is serving 101, but no one else can seem to do it. I knew that he was a really great server based on this but kept watching to see if he hit all aspects and he did! When we ordered an item to split, he brought an extra plate without us asking. We ordered ribs, which obviously require more napkins. My mom was like \"we don't have enough napkins\" and almost told him but I said wait a second, I already know that's what he is going to get and sure enough he came right back with them.   Thank you Nick, for providing great service! Keep it up! I appreciate your attention to detail but not being over the top!",

The nachos is pretty cool they bring them in a bucket and they remove it layers of cheese and chicken and chips. Very good appetizer when you want munch. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. The cheese on The other hand there was something about it. It some what taste funky. Overall the atmosphere was rockin!. Good customer service very friendly.",

    "text": "If I ever see Guy Fieri on the street, I would rush over, ask for a picture, and tell him how great of a TV personality and host he is. And I would follow THAT up by saying how disappointed I was in his restaurant at The Linq in Las Vegas. The fiancee and I came in with realistic expectations. Sure, Strip restaurants come terribly overhyped and overpriced. But we arrived open-minded and craving a solid dining experience. We left underwhelmed and unfortunately, still hungry.   The wait for a #table4two was an hour at 11AM on a weekday. Luckily, we found ourselves the last two seats at the interior bar. The female bartender was very dry and lacked any of the hospitality that I picture from a Guy Fieri restaurant. The design of the place reminded me of a rockstar barn, with cow print bar stools and loud televisions. And I thought that would be the only downside.  But the food was bland at best. The recommended Vegas Fries lacked any texture and crispness. It was basically a serving of fries with buffalo sauce suffocating the basket. The Mac and Cheese Burger was nothing special, with the flavors just meshing together into one big mess. Nothing was overly distinct, not the Mac, not the brioche bun, nor the bacon. And when the bacon doesn't even stand out, something is definitely wrong. We did have the Bloody Mary, which somewhat saved the experience.  But the biggest blunder of this place is the service. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but the customer experience was lacking. Water glasses were never filled, food was not checked up on, and the lady next to us was delivered the wrong burger altogether. There was a certain nonchalance about the whole place. So in return, I nonchalantly will give them one star and direct you to Gordon Ramsay's Burgr down the street at Planet Hollywood.",

Anyway the burger was good but it seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.. The mac \"melted\" off the patty but then it just looked like hard cheese. I like that it came with seasoned fries, crinkle, thin, and wedge. I probably wouldn't suggest to come here again bc there are so many other places to eat in Vegas, but I'm glad I at least tried it and if someone wanted to try this burger I would go with them.",

I got the wings as my main and my husband got the ribs. Our friends got burgers.   The wings were ok, but not great.   The burgers were good. Definitely worth getting the Mac and cheese burger as it's the signature dish he featured on the show. The fries that come with the burgers are great. A mix of shoestring, waffle, steak. Best of all worlds.   The ribs were FANTASTIC!!! Such a great smokey flavor and so tender! They come with cornbread (pretty good), Mac and cheese (dry) and a pickle.   I had the lemon drop to drink. It was great! Sweet and tangy with rosemary in it and a sugar rim. Definitely worth a try!  All in all a good meal.",

The highlight of my brunch was the \"Make Your Own Bloody Mary\". I don't typically enjoy Bloody Mary's, but why not since I was there. I have been craving another one since, it was soooo delicious. I think it's the brown sugar glazed bacon that adds the \"wow\" factor. I had French toast that was accompanied by flambe banana that was perfected cooked. All in all, it was a great experience and I would love to go back for lunch/dinner. Definitely worth stopping ....",

Both were delicious and HUGE sandwiches. The French fries were a hodgepodge of various cuts of potatoes and seasoned well, we enjoyed the variety in not just having the typical fry. Appreciated the presentation of the food as well, food served on a carving board of sorts. Menu offered a nice variety of sandwiches and bar food. Service was just ok, I've had better waiters elsewhere. Overall, good restaurant for the LV Strip.",

    "text": "Guys food was good, but the service was sub par and it was pretty overpriced.  We ordered a little bit of everything, including the fireball wings, pepperoni fondue dippers, the turkey burger, fried ice cream and churros.   The wings were good, sweet and spicy and all drums so we liked that.   The fondue dippers...I wanted real warm soft pretzels with cheese sauce so bad. These pretzel rods were the hard crunchy ones you can buy in the store so they weren't my favorite and at $12! Yikes! The fondue was delicious though, a good portion and we used it for our fries.  The tatted-up turkey burger I had was full of flavor, it's smashed so not your typical juicy burger but had plenty of sauce and toppings to make up for that. Layered with bacon, great slaw, red pepper sauce and the perfect cheese. It's served with a side of various fries but for $18 it's overpiced.  The churro was perfect. Warm dough fried and tossed in cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate and Duce de leche. I'd order it again. The fried ice cream was also killer. It's served with a smorgasbord of sides including pineapple, Mexican creme, Burbon syrup, bananas and peanut butter and strawberries.   As for the service, it was constantly delayed. We had to ask then wait 5 minutes for appetizer plates so the apps became cold, we needed ketchup with our burgers and she didn't come back after our food was delivered for over 10. Then delayed the check and bringing back our cards as well. Our dinner took entirely too long based on service alone. That and the prices makes me hesitant to return.",

This was the third time that between the two of us we had pulled pork on this trip, this was hands down the best! It's a LOT of food, so be prepared. Come hungry lol.   I got the bacon mac and cheese burger. It's huge. It's in your face. It's delicious. Seriously. The only thing that would have made it better is if the burger patty (which was amazing) was swapped out for the pulled pork my husband had!

First, great location and decor. This is a sports bar with great food. The bar area is the center of attention and a great place to eat. They keep the TVs going and are attentive to the games being played.   The food was great. Guy always talks about big flavors. You get that here. My chili was walking the line of too spicy, but it didn't cross it. My wife's pulled pork sandwich was a perfect combination of sweet, savory and sour. The desert was decadent. Beers cold. Excellent overall.   To me the most difficult for most places is great customer service. Not here. The staff #hustles and make it look easy. Want a particular condiment? It is served immediately. You can see inside the kitchen, too. Fast, accurate and clean. No mysteries, and always smiling, even when slammed with an hour of waiting customers.  On a personal note, our bartender (Brittney, an original worker from the opening of the bar) swore she remembered us. We have been there only one other time and it was over a year ago. But she told us where we sat before and what we ordered. Interesting! Could have been a lucky guess, but she was convincing. Also, when I inquired as to certain ingredients in a mixed drink, she not only showed me but poured a small sample. I've been a bartender before and I'm always curious about new concoctions. She and all of the other bartenders were patient and informative. This special attention gets them 5 Stars. I'm not sure how often Guy gets in to check on this locale, but he has made great hiring decisions.   We will be back again!",

She frowned at the possibility of cooking them medium rare...(a must in my eye for a premium $20 burger)...so we settled for medium for both burgers.  We ordered the Original and the Mac and Cheese burger.  The Original came out medium and the Mac and Cheese was well done.  The burger patty was maybe 4oz...where's the beef??...definitely more toppings than burger patty and served with warm not hot trio fries.  The flavors were ok on both but definitely a $10 burger at best!  The Trash Can Brisket Nachos were ordered as well and were definitely better than the burgers.  The cheese sauce on the nachos was a bit bland but overall fairly tasty.  Not worth a second visit and definitely a poor reflection of Gus Fieri in my opinion...a big disappointment!",

She was horrible. I found this strange since the server we had on the first visit here was so friendly, knowledgeable about the dishes and professional. Shelby, however, was none of those things. She would disappear for long stretches of time, didn't know the menu well and couldn't answer the simplest questions about certain dishes.   We already knew that questionaires came at the end of the meal since the previous day our server received high praise from us. Funny how the device suddenly didn't work when Shelby brought the check -- minus a writing utensil. We had to wait until another server walked by our table to use hers so we could sign the receipt. Sigh.",

I appreciated the effort, bit as an avid fan and also having enjoyed his Pleasanton CA restaurant in the past, this meal was a huge disappointment. I won't be back.",

As Guys would say \"this is on point.\" The service was excellent, our server Ayron was on top of every request.  I had the mac & cheese bacon burger. As many other reviews say it is messy and then the plate it comes on is way too small. The fries that come with the burger are of different shapes-; from waffle to shoestring to fatter fries. The burger was good not amazing but I was happy. The drinks come with real is cubes in the shape of ancube, which is kinda cool. The burger was a bit over priced at $20.

The mushrooms stuffed with spinach artichoke dip were served in a hot iron skillet with cream sauce and topped with freshly chopped Roma tomatoes and crispy onion strings.  The side of fries was HUGE!  Before we could ask, our server offered Ranch, BBQ and ketchup.

We got the trash can nachos as an app- there are many conflicting reviews on here so here's how we rate them: if you love nachos as much as we do it's a must try! There was only two of us and we had leftovers so I feel 3-4 people would be perfect to share! They bring it out in a silver tub looking thing and \"dump/shake\" it out onto a plate for you. Pros: this dumping processes mixes all the ingredients up for you so each bite has a little bit of everything on it! To me was awesome! I hate having to pick at my nachos trying to fill up my chips to get a bit of it all! Also was more of a fried pita for the chip rather than tortilla- we really liked it. Con: with the mixing you get fresh cut tomatoes and sour cream in the mix which honestly cooled down the melted cheese and meat a bit so not super hot but more warm but mixing in the cool ingredients it makes sense that would happen. We definitely recommend the nachos! Fiance got the infamous bacon and Mac and cheese burger (he's a huge burger guy and loves trying new ones!) I personally thought it sounded like a heart attack and didn't think the Mac and cheese sounded good on a burger- he took one bite and MADE me try a bite (he never shares lol) I admit is was pretty dang delicious and not at all what I expected. It comes with \"quad\" fries- aka 4 different types of fries- very good!  Obviously pricey but it's Vegas on the strip! Everything was great including our server Scott who was knowledgeable and prompt!",

We came here on a Monday night, and just had to wait about 15 minutes for an outdoor table. Service was quick, and the waitstaff was great. The outdoor space is a decent size and it's covered, so you don't have to worry about the sun beating down on you on a hot day.   Back to the food: LARGE portions! If you are visiting and can't store a doggy bag, definitely consider splitting. There were 3 of us, and we split 2 items, which was the perfect amount of food. We got the Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps and the Tatted Up Turkey Burger. The chicken wraps were like 3 different meals in one- you get spring rolls, chicken skewers and the lettuce wraps. The chicken skewers were pretty good, but I wasn't blown away by the lettuce wraps or spring rolls. The turkey burger on the other hand was the best I've ever had. When my friends wanted to order a turkey burger I was a little disappointed, but I absolutely loved it. There were so many flavors, so this was anything but boring!   This is a great casual dining spot on the strip, and the prices are pretty reasonable. This will be a go to place when I have visitors in town.",

A lot of the menu items were fusion inspired and I love how that takes it to another level of food experience. Located at the Linq hotel. Decided to come around lunch time on a weekend. I did not expect such a wait for this place, but to me, a line is always a good thing regarding food. Says something about the popularity of it in my experience and has never been wrong. Waited roughly 30 minutes. But well worth the wait!  For appetizers, we ordered The General's Wings. General Tso's chicken, but in wing form. Like a sesame chicken wing fort those unfamiliar with General Tso's chicken. The plate looked lovely and the wings were very crispy, and amazingly good! The crunchy dipping sides of crushed wasabi peas, rice crackers and peanuts added a very enjoyable texture that paired excellently well with each bite!   For our entree, my girlfriend and I both ordered the Bacon Mac-N-Cheeseburger. All I can say is mouthwateringly delicious!! The idea of having mac and cheese on a burger was genius! The burger itself was juicy and worked very well with the garlic-buttered brioche bun. It was all presented lovely with the side of fries...4 different ways!   We wanted dessert, but were way to full to even have a bite! But will definitely save from for next time! Highly recommend Guy's!!",

The Mac and cheese burger came out within 5 minutes and was cold which makes me think these are pre-prepared just waiting on an order. The pepperoni bread sticks with queso dip were bland, bland, bland. Not even salt could save this dish. The cocktail came in a standard drinking glass, no decoration and tasted like juice. The server was dressed  so casually I couldn't tell the staff apart from the diners. Actually the whole experience was so bad my husband and I were in disbelief that Guy has lent his name to such an establishment. We left and went to White Castle which was infinitely better.",

The two of us only waited 7 minutes which was nice. Inside of the restaurant is very clean and beautiful, they really utilized the view they have there! Large open windows giving you a view of the strip. I'm a local and appreciated it so I'm sure an out of towner would love it.  We ended up ordering the 52oz hangover fishbowl Bloody Mary (extra spicy) and OH MY GOD, delicious. I ordered the chili bowl and my roommate ordered the motley que sandwich. For some reason the service was really slow, but at least our server was apologetic about it and brought us out complimentary shots. It was a mix of fireball and angry orchard. Definitely not something I'd order on my own but it was free, so I gladly partook. I wish I remembered our servers name, she was a sweetheart.  Our food arrived and it was amazing. The chili had a layer of cheese on top to separate the cornbread so it didn't get soggy. I thought that was genius.  My roommate's sandwich was amazing. The smoked pulled pork was some of the best I've had in this town which I wasn't really expecting. The perfect amount of smokey flavor with moisture in the meat.  We also got the cheesecake challenge to go since we were stuffed, but I've been snacking on it all night. You wouldn't ever think to put potato chips and pretzels on a cheesecake but now I don't think I can eat it any other way. Overall, I had a great experience. Aside from the slow service it was perfect. Luckily I enjoy my roommate's company and we didn't have any other plans so we had a wonderful time.",

We thought we would all order an appetizer and share so we got the brisket nachos, tso chicken wings, truffle fries and pepperoni dippers, out of all of those items the tso chicken wings were our fav and appetizer of choice.  The brisket nachos barely had any brisket on them and the pieces they had were the end pieces that weren't very meaty and also hard.  The pepperoni dippers I thought would be like breadsticks with slices of pepperoni on them however they were very thin breadsticks with small pieces of pepperoni in them which wasn't worth the trouble of even calling them pepperoni dippers. The truffle fries and aioli bland not worth the calories next time we will try a burger since that's what they are known for.",

The waiter was extremely attentive and helpful in making decisions. The menu looked interesting, especially on an empty stomach. They have a variety of combinations on sandwiches (I ordered a Cajun sandwich). They also had all kinds of interesting cocktails that sounded good. Our food and drinks arrived promptly (thank goodness after a long day of travel!).   I gobbled every last bite up (I was huuuuuungry!). All-in-all, it was a great experience and worthwhile if in the vicinity.   It's a little pricy, but if you want cheap, hit up the dollar menu at a fast food establishment. They also accept the Total Rewards card for a discount!   Oh, what a Guy!",

I was a hot mess. The burger was a mess. It reminded my of Hodad's but with some pizazz. During my last visit I met a drunkard who kept insisting that he's met me somewhere. He called me Victoria. I had a full blown conversation with him while waiting for my food. My husband felt bad and was not amused while the guys sitting next to us couldn't stop laughing.  Suggestions:  -Do yourself a favor and get the Quad fries. With the seasoning salt and assortment of waffle, shoestring, sweet potato and crinkle cut taters... I couldn't bare to share, but I did because sharing is caring. -If you don't want to wait for a table, I highly suggest you sit at the bar.

Well, let's just say I'm afraid to find out what part of the donkey the \"donkey sauce\" on my mac & cheese burger came from. It tasted like raw garlic mixed with mayo. The fries taste like they're seasoned with the same stuff they put on BBQ potato chips. The bartender was cool and took it away when she saw I wasn't overly pleased with my meal. But I couldn't find anything on the menu that really appealed to me to replace it - the entire menu is designed to overwhelm. It seems like the idea is to just pile a whole bunch of things on for the sake of piling them on, taste be damned.  So I switched to dessert. The chocolate mint ice cream pie must come with at least a pint of ice cream, topped with mint Oreos, and drizzled tableside with chocolate. It was tasty but enough to feed a family of 6. They took the burger off of my bill, and two drinks and dessert came to $30.  I can't think of a reason to return to this tourist trap. You'll find better food at the Linq (with no lines to get in) at Off The Strip next to O'Shea's.",

We did call ahead to try to get a reservation, but was told they don't take reservations unless party was 13 or more.  We opted to take a seat outside. Was a cold night, but with the outdoor heaters, it was very comfortable, plus the music from the bar next door and outdoors TV's, plus people watching, it is probably the best seat in the house.  Hostess staff could probably try to smile and acknowledge people right away, but everyone else we encountered staff wise was great. Our server was nice, prompt and very personable. He 'bonded' with my husband because they grew up around the same area in Pennsylvania after chatting for a minute about football (there was a payoff football game on the outdoor TV's).

The flavor is spot on.  The pulled pork sandwich was great.....the pork was tender and the barbecue flavor fabulous; the best I've had in a long time and I'm no real fan of BBQ.  The kitchen was a bit slow and some of the pork portions were crunchy, but those are daily kitchen issues and nothing to do with the menu or the flavors.......I'd go again and try more of the menu, definitely.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend last week. Wait time was about 45 minutes, but at least they text you when your table is ready so you can wander or gamble. When we got the text we were seated promptly. Our table was in the patio which was nice, but the band at Carnival was a bit too loud (luckily they only had a few songs left before the end) and the table was slanted/wobbily. I cracked a joke about it with the waiter, but he just made a comment saying it wasn't so bad. We had issues where if one of us took our hand off the table it would lean to the otherside possibly spilling our drinks.  Onto the food. We split an order of General Tso's lollipop wings which were great! They came with crystalized peanuts, wasabi peas, and brown rice chips to dip them in. I really wanted to try some wings here after seeing the pictures of it, unfortunately these were the only ones that sounded appetizing. I wanted some more traditional spicy wings, but the closest one to that was the Fireball wings (which I'm not a fireball fan) and they had spicy bbq sauce on it. I'm glad we got the general tso's.  Main course we both got burgers and split them. We got the Mac'n'Cheese burger and the other one I forgot the name for (onion rings, kicker sauce, and bbq sauce). Both were good, I was worried the Mac'n'Cheese burger would be way too heavy and it wasnt overloaded with it.   Overall the food was great, the service was good, the only complaint I really have is that slanted table we got. I would definately come back to try some of the other offersings.",

It looked like a few tables were clean and open, but the wait was about 15 minutes. After being seated, we waited about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. All of the servers were wearing various NFL jerseys. While several of the servers were hustling, our server was slow moving and inattentive. We had Arnold Palmers to drink. Many around us were drinking Bloody Mary's which had olives, pickles, peppers etc. sticking out of the top of the glass. I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side Caesar, and my wife had the Greek salad. The food was a little slow coming out. The sandwich was great, and the Caesar salad was also excellent with nice garlicky dressing. My wife liked her salad, but hard to screw that up. People seated next to us got burgers which were huge, and looked good. Would go again  and hope server and service were a little better.",

The best burger/sandwich is the BBQ pork one with slaw and sweet pickles.  It's not that the food here is bad, but you are going to pay about $20 per person, and get a very small dish and likely walk away hungry.  If you're not from Vegas, you're probably not used to the presentation of the food, which might be why some people are going bonkers over this place.  But in all seriousness, the food is just like every other burger place on the strip, many of which have gone out of business (Max Brenner).  The name of the restaurant is what draws people here, but I promise that you will get a much better meal for cheaper elsewhere.",

The pork was so good and the bbq sauce a bit sweet so I would get that on the side next time just for my taste.  Our server made me sad.  He never smiled, I had to ask for an ice water 3 times and he never brought the side of Pico de gallo I asked for yet the table next to us got side after side of sauces brought out to them.  My cucumber cocktail was refreshing and tasty but lacked alcohol which surprised me for Guy's place.  Our table neighbors got burgers and they said they lived up to the hype and were delicious.  Fun place I will be back and hope for a different server when I return.  Thanks for the yum snack Guy!",

    "text": "Good food, good service! I was so excited to try Guy Fieri's restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated in 10 mins right around prime dinner time without a reservation. My cousin and I decided to share the trash can brisket nachos and the mayor of flavorton burger. We also tried the frozen shots - chocolate cake and white gummy bear.   The nachos were really good! The chips were nice and crunchy. The meat was smokey and smothered in B-B-Q sauce. (My pic has cheese on the side). Overall really good ratio of toppings like sour cream, beans, and jalapenos but it could have used a little more salsa.   The mayor of flavorton was a huge, tall burger! The pretzel bun is perfect for juicy thick burgers. The pastrami was a little salty for my taste but I'd still say it was a yummy burger.   I had the white gummy bear shot. I believe it had peach schnapps and maybe another type of alcohol mixed with it and topped with a raspberry. It was delicious and sweet (but not overly sweet).   Our waiter was good about checking on our waters. We were so dehydrated from the drinking, dry conditions, and salty food so that was a major plus. Also, he was very funny and entertaining. We enjoyed his service.",

My only complaint is that the fry trio, which seemed to be simply 3 different kinds of frozen potatoes with some seasoning tossed on. With the attention they put into their burgers, a generic side you could get almost anywhere pales in comparison. Plus, when you're paying more, you expect everything to be a little more in quality. Still, not a bad place to get a unique and delicious meal.",

Now that that's off my chest, let's get into frost tip's restaurant. It's maintained well, table setting was actually pretty memorable to me. I thought it was kinda cool. I had eaten a little before coming so I wasn't starving. I ordered a $16 plate of fries (because what?! Yes... french fries... sixteen dollars). While I wrapped my head around the dumb decision I made, the server didn't make things easier for me to not regret. She was visibly annoyed that all I ordered were fries and made that expressively clear. Prior to coming I didn't know my financial decisions would upset her, but this is something everyone in my party had made note of.   The truffle fries, granted were good, and served in a massive mountain as can be seen in my picture. Sadly... Service is one of the primary things that brings me back to the restaurants I frequent. Sometimes even more than the food itself in some cases. Which makes this terrible because I was really intrigued by the macaroni burger on their menu that I will never get to experience if this is the service I can expect.",

Super fast and convenient system, but even so, there was so much congestion in the entry area which was weird.   We got the text and our table pretty quickly. The prices here are definitely reasonable and the portion sizes were a good size! I got the turkey picnic sandwich, which was DELICIOUS. The fries on the side were cold, which was disappointing but the rest of the meal was great.   Overall, worth a stop. I'd go back because they had some interesting drinks and other menu items I would want to try.",

It was good for a quick bite and since I am a fan of Guy Fieri I had to try it.   Food-We decided to order appetizers and drinks for the table. Drinks were good. Food was average and I was not very impressed. The presentation of the food itself was great, but the food tasted just ok. We tried nachos, the generals chicken wings, truffle fries and fondue dippers. The chicken wings were yummy to the tummy. It was the favorite of the table! Fondue dippers just didn't have enough pepperoni in it. It sounds better on the menu. The truffle fries were pretty good. The flavor was on point and I love truffle and more truffle! The nachos looked so good. The barbecue sauce seem to overpower the nachos. Also the brisket that was supposed to be on the nachos was invisible. We could hardly find any brisket it was MIA.  Service-our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Ambiance-fun, cool and hip place. Great outside patio for people watching!  Value-drinks are pricey and food cost you get a nice portion.  Noise-loud but hey it's Vegas!  Overall-worth trying and checking out ONCE. The burgers looked delicious and I wished we would have tried one. It seemed to be the popular choice.",

I've had them before and they were delicious but on this visit they were not prepared correctly.  The sauce which makes them so wonderful was almost entirely absent leaving a dry and somewhat greasy stack of stuff that I couldn't eat.  My expectation is that if I haven't eaten what I ordered at all that I will be asked why.  The wait person made no comment regarding my full plate being returned and that bothers me far more than the bad food.  So I paid the ridiculous Las Vegas price for this inedible meal and poor service.  If prepared correctly they truly are wonderful so I may even try again but will surely not go without saying something if the dish is not excellent.  I hope your Trash Can Nachos are great.  They should be!",

I had the Mac and Cheese burger and really, for as much hype it receives I expected a flavor explosion. Nope, it was just ok. Better than Wahlburgers for sure, but nothing amazing. Bland actually.  My friend had ribs. As far as I know,  aren't ribs supposed to be tender? Like, you shouldn't have to saw them apart? The meat was tough too. I think Fieri's bbq  sauce is one of the best, but these ribs tasted like they were doused in liquid smoke. Smokey flavor is good. Ribs that taste like a campfire? Bad. The plate they were served on was so small that it was impossible to tackle the smokey mess without it spilling over onto the table. Speaking of messy food, we asked for napkins and they threw two wet nap packets on the table. Hope Guy's other places are better!",

It looked good but one bite told a different story. To start, the biscuit had a horrible combination of herbs that just didn't make sense in a biscuit. The deep fried bacon, while it had a good breading, was severely undercooked with the fat no where near being rendered. The eggs had an off-flavor that I couldn't quite put my my finger on.  In retrospect, I should have gone with trusty breakfast items such as pancakes (a couple next to us had some and it looked great... the two gentlemen looked perfectly fine with their meal).  I am giving this review a 1 star because I believe a restaurant should bring it every single time with every single item.  I wouldn't want my name attached to that nasty slop I was given this morning.",

Mike is an old friend of Guy's and we always use to visit him when he was at Fitzgerald's on Fremont St.  I was super glad to see him here and was friendly and entertaining and a GREAT bartender.

First I have to say that I am a HUGE Guy Fieri fan so was very excited to eat at one of his restaurants...that being said, I should have waited to make it to California before I ate at one of his restaurants...   From the start it was an awkward place to go, when we went to put our name in to be seated our name were not taken and we were told that we could wait in the seats around the corner out of the Hostesses view.  We sat there for a second then opted to stand in the tiny waiting area as we were not confident she would remember that we were there.    We were escorted to our table and given very awkward planks of wood with the menu items on it (in the style of a clipboard).   Once we decided on what we wanted we waited...and waited...and waited for our server.  When he got there we both ordered the tacos (the chicken and steak respectively).  I was impressed by the burgers so I didn't think about taco size.    When they arrived I was FLOORED - for $16 I got 4 small tacos....appetizer size!.  I looked in disbelieve at my tacos compared to the burgers.  I wasn't expecting huge tacos but the were so small that I asked if maybe we accidentally got the kids size tacos.  Nope those were the adult tacos.     Had I known that I would have skipped Guy's totally and gone to Bobby Burger Palace.. Not really worth it...even in Las Vegas",

The service was decent. There was a large table next to me and our server spent a it of time checking on them. It would've been nice to get refills on water from time to time. However, He hustled hard and the girl that bussed the tables really moved! I wish I knew her name so I could include it in my review. They seemed to work well together!

First I like to mention the Ace Perry Cider that I ordered. That will be my forever favorite! What an awesome taste, especially in combination with the tasty menu items!   We ordered the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers and the Righteous Rojo Rings for an appetizer. We loved it, and couldn't get enough! Finally something different! American food but infused with worldly flavors! Awesome! We love Chili, so we had to try the Southern Smothered Chili Bowl! The cornbread on top with the sour cream, yummy! We give it a 5star! Another one of my favorite are the Fireball Whiskey Wings. The blue-sabi sauce that comes with it is divine!  The fries! OMG! The best fries I ate in the United States for sure. They come in different sizes and styles... a must try!   I especially like the unique way the food is presented. Each menu item has a different kind of set up. I love eating with my eyes, and I was satisfied for sure.  Big compliment to the entire staff! Everybody is in a great mood, happy and helpful! They sure know what the menu items are, and explain it well.   This was my third visit to Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar, and it definitely became one of my favorite American restaurant within one week!",

After getting seated and the waitress already taken our orders, it was about 30 minutes has past and no one came to check up on us or offer the status of our order. Until my boyfriend asked another server about the progress of our order because our waitress never came back to us.  The food eventually came and it was cold or it was obvious that it's been sitting out for awhile. None of the workers acknowledge us or came back to the table until we asked for our bill. The service just brought down the whole dinner experience that I just wanted to eat the cold food, pay, and leave. I'm a big fan of guy fieri but this was disappointing for my personally experience. Probably will not come back again.",

I guess I paid for Guy's name. My wife got the burger, which she requested without the weird mayo, I believe it was called donkey sauce. Naturally the burger came covered in it. It was served on a wood board that was warped, so every time she touched the board it rolled back and fourth. The burger was just a mess of sauce, that she didn't want, and fell apart, along with being raw in the middle.   I got the nachos, which weren't to bad, but came served in some weird pot that had no bottom. The server pulled it off and it took a bunch of cheese and sauce with it.   In my opinion skip it, seems to be all flair and not much substance.",

It's called the \"lemon drop -NOT\" Awesome drink. So awesome I was about to get another one, but a random(not our original bartender) rudely rushed me & my friends off so no drink #2- infinity & beyond. Rude bartender didn't want any more money at the bar. Ok so the 2nd issue is both of my friends ordered burgers. One said her burger was mediocre at best. Keep in mind this burger was voted the best burger in Vegas , according to the menu. The other friend had the worst burger in her life. My other friend sample her burger & concurred. 3rd the french fries were old & bad...BOTH times they came out of the kitchen. Had I known they were going to be bad the 2nd time around, I wouldn't have sent the first batch back lol. My veggie burger was ok.",

The nachos were amazing. This spot is great for people watching on the strip too!  I'm giving this just 3 stars because the services was horrible. Our waiter seemed pissed that we just wanted to split nachos (they're $20 I might add). We tip well, so it shouldn't matter what we ordered.   My other negative was the cocktail. While delicious, it was small- almost the size of a large shot and it was $14. Yes, this is Vegas, but you can get way more for the price or less at other locations. Skip the cocktails and just get beer.   So the food and location- great- 4 stars. The service and value-3 stars.",

I was expecting a bigger menu with a lot more options but the items on there were pretty good. I Didn't order much because we were short on time. I got some BBQ wings (so basic so sad) they were flavorful and very juicy. However I was trying to get a peak at every ones plate and the portions were huge and they all looked very good, I honestly wanted to order more. The environment was very upbeat and energetic, the wait staff were super outgoing and friendly. I will for sure return and order something a little fancier.",

The portions and presentation are huge, and I notice a lot of people don't finish. For lunch I had the Turkey Burger, which the menu implied was spicy but wasn't, though definitely flavorful. I kind of deconstructed it as I got full.  I returned for breakfast and had the Maple Bacon French Toast - the candied bacon and bruleed banana were excellent, but the french toast was a little dry. I made it through about half the toast.  Staff were super nice to me even though I don't know football from my foot, which was a marked contrast to everyone else at the bar. Made me want to learn some stats to throw around myself.",

Decor was cute.  Wait staff was good.   Food... Meh.  I shared the shrimp appetizer with Thai chili sauce,  that was actually pretty good. 4 stars for that.   The main dish the ribs with mac n cheese, slaw and toast was not good.  Ribs were OK nothing special, I would have liked more sauce on them.  The mac n cheese,  nothing special , very small serving,  covered with fried onions and placed on top of the toast.  Mac n cheese was lukewarm at best and it made my toast soggy. I had no interest in the slaw as I don't care for it ever.  Side note the pickles that came on the plate were really good.  Chalk it up to experience...  Too expensive to be just meh. I actually would have rather gone to a Chili's. I would skip this place.",

I had the Mayor of Flavor-town burger with pastrami, Swiss and cole slaw. It was absolutely delicious and the hamburger had an incredible almost intoxicating aroma and tasted as good as it smelled. I was very full eating one half of it. The fries were a combination of different types and I enjoyed the different textures and flavors of them all. My husband had the award winning Bacon and MAC & Cheese Burger which he loved so much he ate the whole thing. We ordered one for our son to take home for him. We we tortured by the amazing smells of the burgers the whole way home. I had to eat my leftovers for dinner tonight. I expected nothing less than burger perfection and Guy delivered. Thank you!",

The fries they had was 3 different kinds, from waffle to crinkle cut fries with each one with a different flavor.  Overall the pricing was high, food portion was a lot, and flavors were there but not super great.",

    "text": "I like Guy Fieri. He's from Vegas, I love his show DDD, and he seems like he would be a pretty chill dude. But his restaurant at the Linq was pretty sucky.  It was hot as balls outside, but the large outdoor patio had perfect people watching views, equipped with tv's, (showing the Food Network, of course) misters, and fans. The service started out sllooowww. Our server was busy, so we cut her some slack, but after 20 minutes of her not even stopping by our table to say hello, or offer any drinks, we realized that she simply just forgot about us. My friend had to walk up to a random server and ask him to help us. He apologized profusely and told us they were going through a shift change, and although he was on his way out, he took our drink order and introduced us to Amber who would be our new server. Amber was very nice and took care of us for the remainder of our lunch, but I still saw the other chick serving tables, so I wonder what the deal was.  My friend ordered some fruity drink, and also the beer sampler. I ordered a Blue Moon, but was told they were out, so Amber suggested a Lemon Shandy. A short time later, the table next to us receives a pitcher of Blue Moon. WTF! I thought they were out. I didn't say anything because I enjoyed the Lemon Shandy, but it's the principle. The other table came in after us too, so it wasn't like they had just emptied out the keg with their pitcher or anything. Things that make you go hmmm.  Ok so the food which I thought would be amazing, was not even good, and the prices were ridonkulous. I ordered the Ringer Burger, which sounded great, but it was actually very boring. The quad fries that came with the burger were ok, mostly cold though. Dip em' in the house made ranch-that stuff is bomb. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and she seemed to enjoy it. For drinks, eats and tip we both paid close to $40 each. I don't mind paying good money for good food, but this place is simply not worth it.",

My favorite food here is the mac and cheese burger and the lettuce wraps. I always find this place fun and love the way the food is presented too. We  took Panoe Cattle (rum, fresh strawberries and mint) and Austin Sweet Tea ( sweet tea vodka, peach schnapps) cocktails to go. The sweet tea cocktail was really too sweet for me but it was good.",

It took a few minutes to get someone's attention, not our waitress, and we were told she would bring them when they had some up. So there sat our food.   We had the Lettuce Wraps app, & the chicken skewers were cold, dry, burned, & flavorless. We told our waitress, Veronica B. She offered to take those & bring more, which she did, but they were still dry & cold. I can only assume that the food is not made fresh to order. We didn't eat them & they were still there when she cleared our plates, but she never asked if the second set was any better.  The chilli bowl was pretty good, but also room temperature. We were looking forward to this place, but just ended up disappointed. Don't waste your time.",

There's not really a waiting area so I guess if you wanted to you could roam around the casino for a bit. First of all, I want to say our waiter was amazing! He was serving a big party and the rest of his tables but he was able to check up on us pretty frequently. He was such a fun guy to talk to and he gave us recommendations for everything on the menu.  We ordered the sashimi won-tacos for our appetizer and they were really good! Probably my favorite part of my meal. I got the mac+cheese bacon burger for my main course that comes with a bunch of different cut fries. It was good and definitely a big portion but not the best burger I've had. My brother got the same thing and said it's now his favorite burger he's ever tasted. So to each their own. For dessert we shared the Guy's cheesecake challenge. On paper it sounds good, in front of you it looks amazing, but when I actually tasted it, it fell short. The potato chips and pretzels give it a nice contrast of textures to the large mound of cheesecake, which isn't overly sweet. I just didn't find myself wanting more of it after a few spoonfuls.   I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the other dishes on the menu, however, with the price and the wait time, it can wait haha.",

    "text": "I kind of went into this expecting the food to suck... just because I only know that it would only be that much easier for them to impress me. The wait time was alright (45 minutes). It was a tad bit shorter than that. We were all hungry and we were already here because we were listening to a good friend playing outside with the band.  Our server comes to us and takes our order... I get the mayor of flavortown. pastrami, burger, slaw, cheese, and onion straws. Pastrami was dry. almost to jerky status. Burger was somewhat dry. The chuck was seasoned very well. I believe the sauce was a garlic butter based sauce. This happened to be pretty good. Pretzel bun also complimented the size of the burger and held it together. The amount of meat you get is gargantuan. Could this burger be good? YES. This burger has the most amount of potential. If the pastrami was a couple mm thicker and if the burger was cooked to a medium like I asked this burger would have been phenomenal. Not only that but it took about 30 minutes to get our food which is slightly ridiculous.  The fries on the other hand were grrreat. They had barbeque seasoning and made it amazing. It was not overwhelming thankfully.  The waitress gave us a hard time with splitting checks. So I am not sure if this is a company policy but the waitress had to her manager to run this transaction. Not only does it make the payment easier for the cashier, a lot of math doesn't have to be done on the customers behalf.  Overall, I went in this restaurant expecting it to suck because of fellow close foodies.... and they weren't wrong.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try this place out for our first anniversary last week. My husband is a huge burger fan so this seemed like a sensible place to go. We didn't make a reservation since we were still on the fence about it all day. It was a Friday night and I was expecting a much longer wait than what we were quoted, 40 minutes and that was accurate.  There was not enough room for everybody waiting so that was really annoying. The front staff just seemed to be unhappy to be there. The lead host they had barely even looked up from her computer while she spoke with the guests. I did observe an older couple coming up to the host stand, old man was very friendly but like I said, lead host had no personality and eventually seemed to make the old man uncomfortable with the exchange. This really frustrated me because when I used to work the service industry, I would never let my guest feel like this. I did not see her smile once during my 40-minute wait. The other hosts seemed friendlier but mostly seemed fake. I also saw a manager bossing everybody around but not helping out. Big pet peeve!!! Managers, you are not above your employees. If it weren't for their hard work, you wouldn't be around! We finally got sat and our server was very friendly. She was very attentive to our table and she had a few others too. My husband likes to gulp his drinks so it tends to be a lot of work for the servers and we make up for it with our tip. This night, he didn't even need to ask for a refill. Not once! I am kicking myself right now for not remember her name! I ordered a mojito and it was really good. Husband and I tried the Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries for the appetizer. The waffle fries were amazing, the chili was good but nothing special. I had the Motley Que Sandwich and my husband tried the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger. The barbeque sandwich was phenomenal and my husband enjoyed his burger. However, I still didn't feel that the prices were justified. I've had better and cheaper barbeque and that goes the same for my husband and burgers. The portions are big and we didn't really have the table space for them but I guess we made it work. I really should have been more mindful of this but I really didn't expect that the music would be so loud. My husband and I couldn't have a normal conversation without having to raise our voices to a level past our comfort zone. I also noticed a busser slacking off, chatting it up with the servers when there were three dirty tables within five feet of him. I consider this an eyesore, the dirty tables and the lazy employee.  Overall, my husband and I had an okay experience. We will definitely remember not to come here for a romantic date night. This would be a great place to hang out with some friends though. Food was great, server was great, music was way too loud for comfort, either a bigger wait area or more efficient seating during volume, managers need to be leaders, not bosses, friendlier front staff! We most likely won't be back. Maybe unless we were already in vicinity and hungry. Then again, there's a few other restaurants we could try out for experience. Only because we have burger and barbeque joints that we go to that are cheaper, better, and friendlier front staff.",

Chicken fried bacon with biscuits and gravy oh my! This has to be one of the best biscuits I have ever had.......I only wish they gave you a little bit more gravy.

She loved her salad, and I didn't love my Big Dipper.  The dish itself was good.  I love that for fries you get every imaginable fry possible.  Regular fries, waffle fries, pub fries, you name it, you get it.  That was a nice touch.  The crispy onions were great on top of the sandwich, the horseradish was \"on point\" but man, I gotta tell ya, the prime rib was just too fatty.  Listen, I know that fat = flavor so you have to leave some of that in there to make a good tasting sandwich.  And I wanted so bad to eat all of it because the flavor was great.  It was just too fatty; it felt like I was eating more fat than meat.  And I get pricing on the Strip is going to be higher than normal, but even if that sandwich was perfect, it wouldn't have been a $20 sandwich.  I would go there again, but try something much different.",

Also were helpful when my son got sick at the table from eating the Fresno Chile that came with his bbq wings. Also they removed the pepperoni breadsticks from my bill when it was obvious they were not a hit with the table.   Here is the bad: my son said the Wings tasted funny. So I made the mistake of eating them. I didn't pay attention to whether the meat was fully cooked. But the meat must not have been, because within one hour of leaving I became violently ill. I am on my third day of suffering the effects of the food poisoning. Ruined the last 2 days of my trip to Vegas. My friend's son got the runs from eating the hamburger. And my friend is still sick as well from the grease. We are pretty sure the issue was  uncooked chicken and old grease. We will not return to the restaurant.

Incidentally, we have a Johnny Garlic's near us in Dublin, CA, and the exact same macaroni and cheese burger is on their menu for $6 less. Since I know it's good though, I ordered that and was content. I liked the concept of the Quad fries, too. Really crunchy and good for those of us who like a little variety of all of the different kind of fries. Service - slow as f. It was unclear who our server even was, since we had multiple people helping us, but whatever. Either way, they could step up their game in that arena.  And side note, I wish they served breakfast longer. I was dying to try the bacon biscuits (they have them advertised on their menu and I feel like I saw them somewhere else in some Vegas highlights magazine), so it was a bummer to not be able to try them. When I go back to Vegas in April, I hope to try them then. This is a good place to try if you want a burger and fries with a lot of flavor, and the back patio seems perfect for a group.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. I enjoy Mr, Fieri's television show, and when I met him at a Pebble Beach Food and Wine event, he was very nice and seemed like a genuinely good person.  I ate there twice, first dinner, then breakfast the following morning (only because the Hash House a Go Go had a long wait).  For dinner, I had the \"award winning\" bacon mac n cheese burger. It wasn't terrible, but not great either. The mac n cheese part was good, bun was ok, bacon was ok (I know, right...bacon was only ok), but I wasn't given an option on how I'd like my burger cooked. Apparently the only option is slightly burnt. Not as burnt as the fries though. I'm fine with crispy fries, but they passed crispy and kept going. Sadly, they weren't event hot when they got to the table, only crunchy. My dad's brisket was above average. The only complaint about that was the $33 price tag for what you can find in the terminal at DFW airport for twelve bucks. I get it, gotta pay that LV strip overhead. Service was very quick and friendly. The server tried a little too hard to seem \"cool\", he almost was. He used the term \"shit ton\" to describe the amount of fries that came with the meals. It didn't bother me, it happens to be an adjective that I commonly use, but some customers might be offended.  Breakfast was where they really lost me. Chicken fried bacon on sage biscuits with sausage gravy. How could that not be delicious? The gravy, what little of it there was, was good enough, but there's not enough gravy in the dirty south to help choke down those dry ass biscuits. The busser had to refill my water about five times just so I could get through it. Like eating gravy flavored saw dust. I thought someone was gonna have to heimlick me from choking on a bite of a biscuit. The chicken fried bacon...this was my fist time trying it. I can't say it made the bacon any better, though it WAS an improvement from the bacon in my burger. Again, the server was fast and pleasant. This one was a little more professional.",

The service here was absolutely awful.  Waiting long periods for water and clean utensils.  I asked the bartender what the round fried thing on my plate was and he explained to me it was the Quad Cut Fry.  It tasted more like a french fry cooked months ago that was sitting under the fryer that they decided to serve.   Don't believe the hype!",

Well, all that went to hell after I ate at this just awful place.    A couple buddies and I decided to come her before heading out on the town.  Considering we generally subscribe to the dives and hole in the walls with good food mindset when it comes to food, we thought a restaurant by the host of a similarly named show would work splendidly.  We were so wrong.  I think about those hole in the walls that have created a name for themselves based off of a passion for quality of food.  When I think of the exact opposite, Guy Fieri's comes to mind.  The food was largely bland and unimaginative.  For as much as he has seemingly experienced, I was expecting a lot more.  I can only imagine that they provide so much food so that the sure to follow food coma dismisses all potential of motivation for negative thoughts.  Food aside, I do have to give a lot of credit to the staff.  My friend's water glass broke mid-drink.  Literally.  The bottom fell from the glass while he was drinking, and, well you can imagine what happened from that.  Sheer pandemonium of course.  Women were screaming.  Kids were crying.  Cars were burning.  It was mass chaos.  No not really...it was just inconvenient.  The manager, whom I did not notice prior, was on it in a heartbeat.  He was over to our table in what seemed like a matter of seconds apologizing.  On top of that, he even managed to comp a meal, a couple beers, and give a free desert for the table.  That attentiveness was impressive.  Though the service was excellent, there isn't much that would bring me back here.",

Well, the Yelpers let me down on this one.  I will admit the wings/salads looked good but I didn't try them.  I got the '86 cajun chicken sandwich based on reviews and the flavor was there, but the portion size was very weak. I had about 5-6 bites with chicken in it. Give it a go if you're not very hungry.  I tried the Mac n Cheese burger and it was very mediocre, like others have mentioned.  The fries are nothing special, just different types.  I don't usually care too much about presentation but it actually bothered me a lot. They give you this sandwich on a little board with absolutely no room. The fries are spilling down the slanted paper holder they're on, so it's almost impossible to not have your food hit the table. I might try the wings if I went back, but I definitely won't.",

I did not know his name before, but I saw a picture of him on a poster and told my wife that he would f-up our favorite foods. Based on yelp reviews, we decided to try the place anyway.   Yelp let us down. Our fist dish, bourbon buffalo wings, had a weird taste to it. The wings were cold when they arrived. I showed my wife the inside of a red pepper half that came as a veggie side with the wings because it looked black. I looked at the other half and it was moldy. My wife showed it to the manager, and he quickly took it away and removed it from the bill. The beef ribs had an equally weird taste and were served just a little warm. They came with little bars of soft flavorless bread. We ordered a burger, and that at least was good. The temperature was appropriate, and the side of fries was fresh from the frier.   My wife agreed with me. Guy Fieri f-ed up two of our favorite foods: wings and ribs. I would give them one star except for the great service. The manager and the waiter were very attentive. But we can't justify more than two stars for a restaurant based on service alone.",

It is like TGIFriday's on steroids.  Of the dishes we had that night I thought the Motley Que was pretty decent albeit a little on the sweet side.  The bread n butter pickle chips gave a nice dimension to the sandwich.  Mac n cheese burger was a bit too much and flavor of mac n cheese got drowned out by the burger.  The Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries is as if Nachos Supreme had an unholy love child with chili cheese fries.  I know that it may be a bit paradoxical, but there are so many flavors, that it ends up having no real flavor.    Service was a miss for us that night as our server never came  by to check on how we were doing.  Sure he passed our table many times...at warp speed. We even had to wait 20 min for our to-go containers.  But this may improve as time goes on as it was pretty clear that they were all overwhelmed. An interesting dinner to chalk one up on my list, but probably won't be returning. $20 for a burger?!?!? Seriously. Burgers should not be the same price as a lap dance.",

The pretzel bread was so soft and the bbq was tasty. I also really love slaw on my bbq. The Mac and cheese burger was really good and I've had a Mac and cheese burger somewhere else and I didn't like it so I almost didn't get this but I saw it on DDD so I decided to give it a try since it is their number 2 seller. The motley que being the number 1. I also liked the fireball whisky wings. It was really a great sauce for wings. It was spicy but not too spicy. I recommend the Vegas fries for an appetizer. This is all I had but I ate here twice on a 4 day trip to Vegas and Vegas has such great restaurants. I look forward to eating again when in Vegas",

I ordered the Turkey sub sandwich that comes in a pretzel hoagie and cranberry sauce. If it hadn't been for the sauce the turkey would have been impossible to eat the sandwich.   My friend had the fireball wings that tasted like they had been reheated or were thawed in a microwave. Then covered with an absurd amount of green leafy stuff.

We missed breakfast by a few minutes, so that was a bummer because what people were eating looked amaze.  I split the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger with my sister (definitely shareable, but I think I could've devoured it on my own).  There are so many flavors in this burger from the ancho bacon to the donkey sauce.  The pretzel bun is a nice touch!  Quad fries literally means four different types of french fries all with a savory yet spicy seasoning on top.  Needless to say, I ate most of them PLUS my husband's.  But above all, dessert... not to be missed!!  The four of us split the Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae.  This thing is MASSIVE.  Crunchy, sweet, fruity, salty, everything you could want is there.  The fruits were a little too much for me ( I don't particularly care for bananas), but the peanut butter was soooo good.  I would come back just for the dessert.",

My brother had mentioned before that the aroma that emits from this establishment will peek your interest and urge you to step inside, and it sure worked on my girlfriend and I. We had no issue drifting in to experience something new.  Something new in more ways then one. This was the first time I had been anywhere that has a cut down menu after a certain time. The menu was small but not short of intriguing and delicious sounding items. We went with the Fireball Whisky Wings, and Quad Fries. Both items were so good and they gave us so much.   The food was really good but the condiments were what I have to rave about. The garlic ranch that came with the fries was hands down the best ranch I have ever had. I wish they bottled it and sold it in stores. The quad fries were unique, it was a basket of four different types of fries, waffle, sidewinders, julienne, and crinkle cut, something for everyone. Wings could be ordered in different quantities so we ordered twelve of their Fireball Whisky Wings and these I enjoyed very much. I have a weird thing about eating chicken on the bone but these were cooked so well that the meat slid right off the bone. They tasted as if they were baked, lightly fried and then covered in sauce. The meat was juicy with the outside having a little crisp. Again the dipping sauce was the thing that  had my attention. It was a blue cheese wasabi sauce, weird combination I know. Somehow it worked, spicy and tangy all in one.   The service here was top notch, I am always afraid to just order a few small items and watch the waiter or waitress roll their eyes in disgust. Since we just wanted a taste of this place, all that was ordered was some wings, fries, a beer, and a soda. The waiter just said \"excellent, let me get this order in right away for you\", no \"anything else?\", or \"did you need a few more minuets to pick out some more items?\". He was perfectly content with our small order. He came back twice to see if our food was good, filled my soda up twice and quickly got us some more of that amazing garlic ranch that we quickly devoured.  Next positive of this place was the decor. The way I described it while sitting there was a rustic sort of American Pickers kind of vibe. A lot of interesting antique items on the walls. A very comfortable night environment, and if you do not like the inside they have a large outdoor patio that overlooks the Vegas street folk. They are not short of televisions either, at least five right around me, and most of the stations were appropriately tuned into cooking shows which was a nice attention to detail. The silverware was beefy heavy metal and the lighting was nice and dim.  I really enjoyed this place. The best part part is enjoying their tasting menu. So when I go back to Vegas in a few months I will get here in time to try something off their full menu. My suggestion is to stop in, enjoy the service, decor, grab a little snack, and for heavens sake try the garlic ranch!",

Beyond that, our server and the food, (OMG THE FOOD!) was great. I was bummed they got rid of the nachos, but my Motley Cue was seriously the best sandwich I've ever had of its kind. And I've tried a lot of pulled pork sandwiches. It's weird but True. I almost cried when my server asked if he could take my plate because I was too full to finish. It wasn't heavy or soggy or falling apart, it was perfect. Guy Gieri rested the day after he made that sandwhich.  I also had the cider, pear or pineapple? Or both maybe? It was great also.

The right amount of heat on tuna tacos. I could have just eaten a couple more of these and had been happy.  Very good. I ordered the Double Barrel BBQ wings.  I was initially skeptical because I thought that the effort to make them \"lollipop\" wings (pushing all of the meat to one end of the bone) was to disguise something was missing.  But I was wrong, they were delicious all around. It's a burger joint, so we had to order a burger.  my girl got the Smash Burger, which was great.  The plating was again fun, a little bit heavy on the salt-side but nothing overwhelming.    Service was great.  Our server was Jill, and not only did she know about all of the food, she was easy to interact with.  You can tell she cares about her job because she expresses the \"fun\" nature that this place tries to provide its customers.  I have to get going, I'm off to watch some Food Network.",

Then there are the mountainous desserts that you must share with the entire table.    Drinks coming from the amazing bartenders are a symphony of flavors from your first sip to your last.  If you visit frequently just start at the top of the specialty menu and work your way down... You won't be disappointed.   Megan and Laura during the day are simply an amazing bar team.    Sharin was my server and was super friendly and amazingly fast.  Drinks were filled before they were empty, our dishes were whisked away immediately when we were finished and we were not rushed off after our meal.    They are centrally located on the strip in the Linq and have a patio for those wishing to enjoy the outside   When in Vegas it's a must do!",

We arrived at 9:15pm. After 10 they stop serving the full menu and give you just a few options. Well, we went in after 10 since we made the line for 45 minutes and as we entered I could see between 7-10 tables perfectly clean and ready to use!!! WHAAAAAAT???!!! They made us wait just so people passing by see a line outside!!! And I missed the full menu because of that! I won't go back",

The waitstaff here are like the Walking Dead. They don't seem to have a pulse, are lethargic in their service and can barely be bothered to get you a coffee. The sound of their feet quiet literally dragging across the floor in a slow shuffle is hardly music to any diners ears. With the exception of the host staff and hot lesbian table runner, this place exudes a total too cool for school attitude that translates into a lackluster dining experience.  The food: quite frankly, Robert Irvine would have a field day here. I am 99% sure my breakfast potatoes were frozen and the accompanying onions were a weird gray color, the peppers limp and wilted. This from a TV personality that takes us around the country sampling fresh, unctuous, decadent dishes from our favorite greasy spoons? Something is not quite right -- the food doesn't represent the name on the marquee leading me to believe that perhaps it is just that -- a famous name slapped onto a mediocre at best restaurant. Disappointing. The square ice cubes are a nice touch, though.",

I am a local who wanted to take my friends coming from out of town to a great restaurant. After looking at some reviews I decided Guy's would be the best. It was a Wednesday afternoon and the restaurant was busy. Like always, there was a 30 minute wait time. So for those of you planning a dinner(make a reservation.) My group didn't mind, we went to the Carnival bar and had a drink. Once we sat down, we waited to order our drinks. My coworker order a beer and our waitress forgot. We had to remind her and still he waited 20 after ordering the beer to get his.  I also work in the service industry, and I understand that no matter how tired or out of it you are, you must always put on a face.  Well our food was AWESOME! so good...but we sat down at 8:35...and our food got there at 10PM. That is a long time. Our waitress only came to our table to drop off our drinks, my coworkers beer, and food.   By the time we were done eating, we just wanted to leave. We get the bill and...the waitress added an extra order. She finally came by 10 minutes later, corrected it...and finally we got to leave.   I will not be coming back or referring my friends.",

First off, the playing was terrible. It was a small and narrow wooden slab and the food was barely on it. If something shifted, your food would be on the table. The burger was thinner than I expected but the meat was seasoned well. The onion ring on top of the burger was not good flavor wise. Is once that is the feature of this particular item, that is ungood. The breading was too think and it was not crispy. The bun was a buttered brioche bun and it had a spicy mayo and BBQ sauce condiment. All that made the burger greasy and it was too many competing flavors. I ended up cutting the buttery part out and it ended up being much better.  My mother liked the pulled pork but the bread was too much.   The last disappointment was the fries. I LOVE FRIES and that is usually my favorite part. This plate had four different types of fries (waffle, shoestring, crinkle & curly). Some of the fries were seasoned and some were not. This was awful. They were overseasoned and due to the different types it highlighted what you didn't like. I think it should be ONE type of fry and the best one was the curly. I wanted to like this place but I did not. I definitely would not go back.",

The $14 red wine blend was nothing to write home about.  All in all the I expected the food to be \"Out of Bounds\" good, but it fell flat; staff was courteous and efficient, and the atmosphere was fun.",

Was very good. BBQ sauce was the story. I got the Mac N Cheese bacon burger. Huge, very impressive. Came with 3 or 4 different kinds of fries all mixed together. Getting all the different fries was very cool. Didnt have to pick. Steak fries, shoestrings, battered fries, etc. For dessert, you have several amazing options- they even had churros! Lol. We HAD to get the S'mores Monte Cristo. Yes people- a huge, DEEP FRIED S'MORES Sandwich. Unreal. Comes with berry jam and hot fudge to dip. SO GOOD. Overall, great, casual, laid back feel. Great Staff and decent prices. I will be including photos. Would DEF recommend and will go back next time we are in town.",

That was alright but the next day when we went back.......BRISKET NACHOS.......BEST I'VE EEEEEVVVVEEEERRRRR had!!!!  I can't wait to order them again this weekend when we go, so delicious!  Although we ordered that as an appetizer and were so full I couldn't even take a second bite of my pulled pork sandwich I ordered.  Great food, great atmosphere, never a terrible wait.  Totally worth going!",

The restaurant does not have a kids menu, but our awesome waiter made sure our toddler was fed. He was good enough to check with the kitchen and we were able to order her a side of chicken and avocado. Our 14 month old loved it! We ordered the Triple T Fries, Victor's Street Tacos, Tatted Up Turkey Burder, Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger, and The Triple B Burger. All the entrees were delicious. Our waiter was great and the hostesses were friendly and gorgeous. We all had an amazing experience and will be returning.",

The fries are crispy and well-seasoned.  The burgers are amazing.  I was honestly shocked by how good the food was.  The names of the food needs to change \"Mayor of Flavortown Burger\"???  I wanted to order that, but I didn't want to look like a jackass ordering so I ordered the Original Ringer.    Mayor of flavortown?  Give it a rest.  You go to a restaurant for the food and the ambiance...not necessarily the person that owns the restaurant.  The food is top-notch and the ambiance is awesome.  You could literally drink there for relatively cheap at the bar and then party on the strip.  Overall a very good experience and one of the surprising highlights of the trip.  Just lose the gimmick and don't post your mug all over the place Guy....other guys don't want to see it.",

Nice touch with the 3 different type fries that come with your fries. Atmosphere was good,  music is loud.  I think this is a hotel owned restaurant,  licensed from Fieri,  at least by the taste of it.  The burgers looked amazing I must say,  wish I would have e gotten one of those. . I think you should try it just to say you have been there.",

    "text": "I've been fortunate enough to dine here three times since it's opening. Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen is located inside The Quad Hotel & Casino. If you're familiar with Guy Fieri on TV and his personality. You will see it echoed prominently in the look & design of his restaurant. Even the attitude & energetic atmosphere exuded by the employees represent Guy Fieri's style. Of course, if you find Guy Fieri's persona & shows unappealing, this would not be the place for you. I've tried the Tatted-up Turkey burger, '67 Cajun chicken sandwich & mac & cheese bacon burger entrees. All were awesome, full of flavor. Each comes with a fry mix & the burgers are massive. The mac & cheese was quite rich. Some might find it too much so, but heck, theres mac & cheese in there, what do you expect right? The '67 surprised me in that the blackened chicken was super tender & cooked perfectly.  And a tasty turkey burger is always a good thing. Their appetizers were all very yummy too. My favorites are the Rojo Rings, onion rings that come hanging on a pipe accompanied by a sriracha ketchup. The Guy-talian fondue dippers, giant breadstickers wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage & provolone cheese dip. I was even dipping my fries in the cheesy dip 'cause I loved it so much. Waiters & servers were very attentive & lively. I was also fortunate enough to meet Mike, the manager of the establishment. I would be willing to go out of my way to The Quad just to come to Guy Fieri's. I do find it interesting that one of the low end hotel casinos on the strip is home to two great food spots. Hash House and here. Definitely earns a 5 star rating in my book!",

We ate here twice because we wanted to try both of the meals that were on the show. The first night I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger which was HUGE, but yummy! The second night I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich on pretzel bun which was okay. I didn't love the cheese on it I felt it could have been melted more and the sandwich was pretty salty. However, the pork marinade was absolutely delicious! All of the surrounding restaurants are around the same price, so we chose to go with one that had large portions to fill us up! Both nights there was a wait (on a Tuesday and Wednesday) around 7:00 p.m. for about 30-40 minutes which I feel is fair for such a busy spot! I enjoyed the atmosphere and I absolutely loved their fries that comes with the sandwiches! All of the waiters and waitresses have similar outfits which is pretty fun. The only complaint is one night one of the waitresses assumed we had a tab at the bar but we didn't (we were drinking water at our table anyway) and she seemed confused. Other than that, I recommend! If you go I recommend getting one of their burgers!",

Our waiter walked by us 3 times before acknowledging us; in fact it took so long that we already knew what we wanted to eat by the time he came over for our drink order. I had to ask multiple times for a lemon for my iced tea, when I indeed asked for one when I ordered it originally. My Cajun sandwich had flavors that did not meld together whatsoever. It was bland meat that seemed to have too much seasoning poured on top and it was over sauced. My husband's pulled pork sandwich seemed to have the same aggressive \"seasoning salt\" poured over it, and it was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted. The fries were stale and seemed reheated in the microwave. The windows need shades because all the guests facing them had to put their sunglasses on due to the brightness. Our waiter never offered refills during the meal, and didn't ask if we wanted dessert (which we did not). Couldn't get out of there quickly enough.",

Found a spot at the bar and grabbed a drink - expensive but it's Vegas and your not at a table gambling so expect higher prices. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed with the traffic though there were certainly plenty of them. (Brittany at the bar was gorgeous but that is another story).   About 30 minutes later seated to a tiny table backed up to a tall dividing wall making table space seem very small and a bit claustrophobic which was strange as whole restaurant bar seemed pretty open and inviting.   Onto the food - had two things at the table - the pulled pork sandwich (famous from triple-d) and the bacon Mac n cheese burger. The sandwich was healthy portion on a long pretzel roll. Had slaw and pickles on it as well. For a $20 sandwich you can do much better but the pork was tender although a bit sweet.   My buddy had the Mac burger and said it was excellent. Even though it sounded incredibly rich, he said it was light leading me to believe that is had been prepared really well and not overdone with the cheese so it was too dense.   Both of us got the fries and they were a bit cold and not too exciting. They were strange in that they were all different shapes and sizes from shoestring to steak fry to waffle fries. Just strange.   Not sure that I will be back other than for the scenery but overall an average Vegas destination. If you are a Caesars rewards member you get a $1 or so off each entree. Just saying.",

The tacos are flavorful but a bit one dimensional (need heat or maybe cilantro?). The Mac and cheese burger is good but wasn't outstanding. All in all a solid experience and glad we stopped by, just nothing that over the top wowed me.",

    "text": "I think the 4 star average review this place has is spot on.  I enjoy Fieri's (nee: Ferry) show \"Diner's Drive-ins, and Dives\" on the Food Network very much.  Guy himself seems like kind of a d-bag but the places he visits are very interesting.  Being a d-bag from northern California, I suspect his own cuisine for his restaurants is firmly in the Flingers (google Office Space) category: over-engineered snack food for fat/lazy/stupid people.  Now, if you know this going in, it's not half bad.  The waitresses are done up in a denim skirt/dress thing and the waiters are in a similiar denim outfit.  OK I guess, but I prefer waitstaff to not be subject to a fixed  dress code unless I am at Hooters.  I got the drunken fish tacos and the truffle fries.  I could not finish the truffle fries, the bowl was huge.  The tacos were actually not bad, I could eat that regularly.  The fries weren't bad either, but I was on a business trip and eating alone.  To share, they would be perfect.  To sum up, there's really nothing wrong with this place, assuming you are OK with average middle-America mall type food.  This will amaze you.  It's a little hard to get to (unless you are staying at the Quad); you have to negotiate your way to the Self-Parking (or take the tram) and then find your way back to the car afterwards.    I know it sounds like I'm dumping all over the place, but I did like it.  I would even go back and try something else out.  I bet it would be a blast with friends (kinda like a sports bar).  But haute cuisine it's not.  Expect something better than your average TGI-Fridays and you'll have a good time.  Another plus is that it is open late (2AM) which kept it on my \"list of places to try when I've been out all night and everything else is closed\".",

I go back because the food is just REALLY good.  Do yourself a favor and try the Motley Que sandwich - DO NOT ALTER IT.  Order it just as is.  Trust me.  I am one of those \"change the cheese, this on the side\" gals - REFRAIN!  You will be glad you did.  It is the perfect sandwich and, while it is expensive, it is huge.  It is definitely shareable, especially if you start off with the Vegas fries - which I highly recommend you do.  I have yet to have room for dessert, but I from what I read and see they look delicious.    If you are willing to put up with some attitude from a snobby hostess in an awfully clad jean mini dress and wait a while for your drinks/food, check this place out.  The food is worth it, and that means a lot coming from me.  See my other reviews, bad customer service is *usually* a deal breaker for me.",

Opted to be seated inside due to some lingering heat outside under the misters on the patio and traffic noise from the strip.   The server was friendly, quick, and rarely checked on our table. The servers seemed to be unsure which tables are assigned in their section because two other servers stopped by after we ordered our drinks and food.   Ordered the General Tso Wings (excellent, not too hot if you're craving some red chile heat, suggestion to try the Fireball Wings).   Ordered the steak and smashed potatoes with asparagus spears and French onion topping. A sauce in a mini pitcher is also delivered. Excellent!!!  Full bar menu, ordered a Moscow mule and a Long Island. Extremely delicious in a pint glass.   Plus, Raider Nation attire when you step foot inside. Love it! Absolutely a go-to place for flavor and experience. Unfortunately, wait staff service could be better. I would definitely come back.",

The fondue appetizer was fantastic and our burgers were amazing. They are the thinner, more tender type burgers, and were very juicy and packed with flavor. I found them to be easily as good or better than the upper crusty burger places. Loved the French fry variety that comes with every burger order, which were seasoned but not overly so.  Speaking of which, kudos to them for keeping prices reasonable. They could have pillaged us with exorbitant \"celebrity chef\" prices, but instead the prices are on par w the average Vegas strip brewpub, with much better quality.   My only suggestion is that outside, when the water misters shut off, flies were a problem (in the summer). For comfort and fly control, they should stay on later. Opt to eat inside if you're concerned (or outside in the winter).   Overall cool and tasty place, and a great value (by Vegas strip standards, that it).",

We both ordered burgers my husband had the triple b burger it was great full of flavor and was moist! I got the mac n cheese burger, I was not crazy about the mac n cheese on the burger it seemed like it didn't belong once i took it off the burger was delish! I love you get different fries with your order the fried potatoes are my fav! We enjoyed watching all the differed largely portioned food coming out of the kitchen and the huge interesting drinks coming from the bar one of the most common we saw was a bloody mary it had a jallapeno and assorted veggie and lemon. I will eat here again!",

As soon as we walked we had to say hi table for two but before she did that another waiter walked up to her and gave her a whole plate of food to hide under the table . I don't think people need to see that. But beside that I loved the place and the food is great and looks amazing",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to trying Guys food for a long time and I finally got the chance on my recent Vegas Vacation.  Located at the Linq Hotel and Casino the Restaurant has a pretty hip vibe and some damn fine looking waitresses. The place is pretty tightly crammed together so it if your looking for a romantic dinner go elsewhere, but if you like an exciting place and good people watching then this fits the bill.The food however was hit and miss.  First off was the starter Triple T Fries. These were seriously good, as long as you like all things mushroom. Crispy and thin shoestring fries are topped with Black and White Shaved Truffles, Truffled Gouda Cheese and are served with Truffle Dip. The portion was huge but of course we finished them all. Next up were the entrees. My Turkey Picnic Sandwich entree was great, perhaps one of the better sandwiches I have had recently. Thick slices of moist roasted Turkey are topped with cranberry relish, melted Swiss, creamy coleslaw and (here's the kicker)...Crunchy BBQ Chips. Its all served between a sliced pretzel baguette slathered with Guys  signature donkey sauce ( basically fancy thousand Island dressing). That's a lot of stuff stuffed into one sandwich but it all mixed great together and every level of flavor showed up in each bite. Also on the side of the sandwich were a mix of fries that were seasoned with BBQ spices. Not that I needed more fries but these were also excellent so I of course finished them.  As good as my Sandwich was, I was very disappointed by my wife Simones, Smothered Chili Bowl entree.  A rather large bowl of chili arrived to the table topped with melted cheese, sour cream, scallions and a big hunk of cornbread and it looked impressive. However, once we moved the cornbread the bowl itself was barely half full with the actual chili. Then, after the first bite we both agreed that we have had better chili from the local Wendys. Someone took the wrong turn at Flavortown and ended up at the No Spice Nursing home. This was perhaps one of the blandest bowls of Chili I have had in recent memory. This was a disappointing end to an otherwise great meal. So at least in my experience I would say that depending on what you order you could walk away very happy or very letdown from Guy's. I would return again but stick to the sandwich menu.",

The wait time to get seated was a little long, but that's because it was busy and it was a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. We started off with some spinach and artichoke stuffed mushrooms which were just incredible. I then had the Mac and Cheese burger which sent me straight to flavor-town and was Capital T Tasty and was also rated the best burger in Las Vegas. This place is a must if you have the the time while you're on the strip, and the hours are great for some late night eats.",

We had a young, dark long-haired woman with tattoo sleeves on both her arms (her name is ASHLEY), and she was NO WHERE to be found for almost 20 minutes after we were done eating, and had stacked our plates for her. I had to ask THREE times for someone to get her, and she never came. I had to then track her down. The \"manager\" (young guy, brown hair) came to find out what happened, and i told him -- he plainly did NOT care, was defensive, blamed us, no apologies, and then..... WALKED AWAY while I was still talking! LOL! *mind blown* Then we waited and waited for our dessert - it never even came, so I tracked down another random waiter and cancelled it. Very mediocre food, terrible service, and guess what, they just don't care about customers. I guess from low-income people making $8/hour, what can you expect? Guy Fieri would be absolutely ashamed of you.",

First when we walked in the hostess asked us how many we said 2 and she looked out the window at all the open seats and stared at it like they were busy!!  After we got seated we waited for 15 min for someone to come to our table, when the waiter finally came he took our food and drink order. I ordered the burger with pastrami on it, it was ok but not worth $20 my daughter ordered the shrimp tacos which was ok. The food came we ate at the end of our meal our 2 arnold palmers finally came and when I told the girl I was done eating and didnt want it she rolled her eyes at me and said gah you dont want it? She then ran over to our waiter and pointed us out, the waiter brought our bill with the 2 drinks on the bill still and said dont worry I will take it off but he left the bill there. I questioned him and he said dont worry I will take it off, just minus the $8 yourself which I did, hopefully he minused it because there was no tip on there if he didnt!! I feel sad because I really wanted to like the place sadly I will not ever go back there!",

Husband had Motley Q, he was in heaven. Loved every bit of it. I cant say enough about the fries....just the thought I want to go back now! Homemade ketchup was great, not sweet like store brands. I dont remember name of what I had but was so good. It had an au jus with it. There was so much food we could have eaten ourselves into a coma. Everything with food was perfect! We were so full we could not eat any dessert. Though they all looked like the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!! Drinks from the bar I have to say were not so good. They were thrown together and probably worst we've had. There were no garnishments on any 5 drinks. Bloody Mary was literally tomatoe juice & vodka. Was so boring that my husband gave bartender a recipe to make for him. Was much better but still no garnishment. No olives, no celery, nothing. We did talk to general manager about it and he did take care of the issue. Assistant manager came by & we made suggestions on the drinks. He did say every drink is to come with garnishment. Both managers were awesome and had great attitudes and asked us personal questions about our visit to Las Vegas. They seemed very sincere.   We definitely will go again when in Vegas!! We so LOVE LOVE this restaurant!!   Wish I could give 5 stars but because of the drinks I had to give 4 stars.  Thank you Guy for opening this great restaurant!!   Thank you Managers & Nichole for giving us such a wonderful experience!!  p.s.~ we also went to Gordon Ramseys in Paris and between the two, Guy's restaurant was by far the best!!!",

Even Bobby Flays burger place is cheaper and much better than this. To charge $20 for a burger is grand theft! People who knew Guy before Food Network made him a \"star\" had outstanding food at a very reasonable price from his original place in Santa Rosa. Now, it is obvious, that Guy has gone after ye almighty dollars and left quality related to price off his menu. This place is no better than a Chili's or Denny's.",

    "text": "Met up with some friends and headed here for the first time. Hearing a lot of buzz about the bacon mac n cheese burger, it was something that I was gonna try first time out. So me and the lady both got the bacon mac n cheese burger, the triple t fries, and the fondue dippers. Let's start with the sides. The fondue dippers was great, it was very flavorful, the fondue was light and cheesy.  The triple t fries were great! I would say one of the top truffle fries I have tried. Definitely a thing to try when coming here. Now here's the thing with the bacon mac n cheese burger, I read that it was one of Guy fieri's award winning burgers. The bacon was cooked great and tasted great. The burger was also tasty and cooked and seasoned well. Now the mac n cheese was a huge let down, the burger is complex and has so much flavors in the bacon and the burger seasoned to perfection, then you put mac n cheese that has been sitting under a heat lamp, dried out, clumpy and very bland on it and it just about ruins it. As great as everything else was on the burger, the mac n cheese just brought the burger down. I dont mind paying $20 for a burger as I love food and trying new things. I just dont understand why the short cut?? I know time is pressed and everything needs to be done as quickly as possible, but when quality gets sacrificed things need to be reevaluated. Also the burger does come with fries (a mixture of crinkle cut, straw fries, waffle fries, and chips???) but you cannot substitute the fries that come with the burger for the likes of the triple t fries, forcing you to buy an entire order if you wanted. Although the fries are a huge order and I was glad I got them maybe having the option to substitute the region fries that come with the burgers for them would be a good idea. So for around $75 for me and my lady it was expensive but in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. Sadly the only way I would ever get the bacon mac n cheese burger would be if Guy himself made it to his standards and maybe then it Will be the great burger that it is claimed to be.",

Also you only get a small handful of fries and for 21 dollars I feel like their should be a better portion of fries.  The service wasn't very good either.. It seemed like the restraunt was understaffed and couldn't get around to the tables quick enough.  Overall the food was solid.. Service below average..",

We spend weeks researching food before our trips, carefully choosing where we eat, and this place was not on our list as we hadnt heard about it opening. On the first visit, we sat at the bar for drinks and an appetizer; triple T fries. They were so good we knew we had to come back for dinner (this was a late night snack). On our return for dinner we ordered the fireball whiskey wings, the mayor of flavor town burger, and the pulled pork sandwhich. I can't even begin to describe how good it was, especially the barbeque pork!  This is our new favorite place. Great food, nice beer list, great service, fun atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!",

I've never seen anything like it before, it was impressive.  The brisket on the nachos was outstanding and the cheeses and sauce was outstanding. I love the way the jalapenos were cut; just the yummy flavor but not too much heat.  My husband ordered the Flat Iron Steak and it was prepared perfectly medium.  I had a bite and the smell, texture and taste of the steak was amazing; so much flavor.  I had the turkey burger (I know, boring right?) not so much with this one.  It was juicy, grilled perfectly, the pretzel bun was soft, and the fixings were great.  Awesome waffle fries too.  My daughter ordered the original burger had had the onions and the cheese taken off.  It arrived just as she ordered it and she said it was one of the best burgers she'd ever had.  We also ordered the Cheesecake Challenge....it was amazing, and no, we didn't finish it. LOL!! Great place Guy, great service.  Thank you for making my Mother's Day dinner memorable.",

I also really recommend the Chicken Lollipops, the Double Barrel BBQ Wings!  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich called the Motley Que.  I like Guy's Carolina Style BBQ Sauce and I buy it at the store, I thought the sauce was a little on the sweet side.  But the Pretzel Bun and Slaw were good as well.  Also, the restaurant is right next to the High Roller.  So if you are planning on going there, it is a great place to stop on your way there.",

The service was good and fast, except for the part where the waitress dripped water from her pitcher onto my phone, then apologized to my friend for 'almost' dripping on hers (didn't notice that she actually hit mine with water).  I ordered the ringer burger, which was tasty but overcooked.  I asked for med-rare, and it was more like med-well done.  That's all fine, and I probably wouldn't write a review if that was all, but the thing that I think really needs to be corrected is the fries.  The \"regular\" fries are so over seasoned they were inedible.  They tasted like bar-be-cue potato chips.  If that's your thing, great, but they should be advertised that way, because that was not what I was expecting.   We also ordered some of those huge cocktails to share.  They were a little pricey, but very tasty.  I would not recommend the fruity one, though, it was too sweet. Overall, not my favorite burger place on the strip, but it was worth going and I would go back.",

The atmosphere in the restaurant was very upbeat very live and your hostess greet you right on the spot. It was packed for Friday night which is normal for any restaurant. We waited about 15 minutes. We sat outside near the strip so we can see the people walking up and down the street. Our server Chris was funny as hell. He made our first time coming here very fun and he also recommended some items on the menu. The first thing I got was a shot of fireball whiskey. Next the hubby and I decided what we were going to get. He got the off the hook burger. I got the Triple B burger. We got our food the presentation was good. All the burgers come with fries and its just not one set of Fri you have a mixture of fries there are crinkle cut fries Criss cut fries and steak fries all mixed together in a small dish. They are seasoned with this dry barbecue rub that is so good especially when you dip the fries and ranch. Not to mention that the ranch is homemade which is really good. The hubby and I could not even finish our burgers they were so big and so good. We said we would definitely be back because we want to try the tacos that he has on the menu. This would definitely be a place that I go too when I go to Vegas.",

The tortilla chips on the side were served with a cheese sauce which was rich but light. My boyfriend ordered the Shortbread Pancakes which were bigger than his head but he killed it because it was so delicious. We enjoyed breakfast so much my boyfriend wanted to come back for our last night in Vegas. I ordered the Original Ringer burger that was juicy, savory, crunchy, and satisfying just like a good old American burger should be and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Mac & Cheese burger which disappeared from sight. We also ordered a side of the Vegas fries which was ridiculously good and reminiscent of buffalo wings with a blue cheese sauce. Once again, not skimping on portions and satisfied our cravings. I also highly recommend the Rumchata frozen shots...Lord knows I had quite a few! Definitely making this restaurant one of our favorite spots in Vegas for casual food and drinks!",

Already having the munchies, I medicated even more in the car, expecting a wait. I was wrong. Higher than the High Roller itself, I walked in and was greeted by a beautiful hostess. We waited for what seemed like less than a minute, before we were called for our seats. (I like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.)   The menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. The menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. We started with drinks. \"Lemon drop...Not!\" for her and a Firestone Union Jack IPA for me. I don't usually drink lemon drops (only when I try hers) but I have to say it was the best one I've had so far. We decided on the Drunken Fish Tacos, Triple T Fries, Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps and the Mac + Cheese Bacon Burger.   The Triple T fries and Drunken Fish tacos were served first. The Triple T fries were amazing! Truffle chunks, truffle infused Gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. Bachi who? They don't skimp here! The Drunken Fish tacos were on another level. They consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. Then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination.   Soon after, the Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps and Mac + Cheese Bacon burger were heading to our table. The Ultimate Asian Chicken wraps are a must try. The Chinese minced chicken was on point. You also get three spring rolls and two Thai style skewers. It's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. Just make sure your hands are washed! Now onto the burger. The Six Cheese Mac + Cheese Bacon burger was bombdotcom. Hands down one of the best burgers I've had. Mac + Cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. Accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. I was already full from finishing the previous dishes so I only ate half and have to pack the rest. Next time I won't order as much so we could get dessert.   Overall the experience was fantastic! Service was outstanding! Food was amazing! I WILL be coming back again, and again.",

    "text": "This was hands down the best place I have ever eaten!  I was not disappointed in any way here.   The restaurant:  The atmosphere is very fun and very much like Guy.  The staff is dressed in denim outfits with leather like vests/aprons.  The tables, silverware and layout have a modern industrial type feeling.  The kitchen is very open to the restaurant so you can just look in and see exactly what's going on in there (a well oiled machine).  There is also a mini shop in the front to buy various things from him and the restaurant.  We ended up buying one of the bandana like napkin towels that are on the table.  The food:  This was the best food I've had in a long time!  Certainly the best on the strip.  In any price class.  It came out very fast and was presented extremely well.  The fries are a mix of all types and seasoned to perfection.  The burgers are moist and flavorful.  Try the Mac-n-cheese bacon burger and you won't want anything else.  The pulled pork was so good and on a pretzel bun it was over the top.  The drink selection was awesome and they had a little something for whatever you're looking for.  Overall:  Extremely pleased at my whole experience at this eatery.  I went straight to flavor town and never looked back.  Go and enjoy yourself!",

She took our order and had a friendly conversation with us about food and Guy Fieri.   We ordered the \"Triple T\" fries and the general's wings. It did take about 25 minutes to get our food-disappointing.  The wings were good. A sweet, tangy, and spicy sauce with 3 dipping choices of toppings. Lollipop style wing was easy to eat.  The \"Triple T\" fries were good but not the greatest truffle fries I have tried. In my opinion and the girlfriend's opinion they were a little too greasy.  Would I try this place again? Yeah, I'll give it another whirl. I guess, I was just expecting a little too much from Guy.",

    "text": "If you're looking for Flavortown, you'll find it right between Mediocreville and Ridiculousburg. Flavors are over the top. A mixture of so many bold flavors that compete with each other, hoping that you'll like at least one of the half dozen profiles.   An embargo should be placed on Flavortown for their over the top ridiculousness of the bold flavors, crazy dia de los muertos meets affliction decor, and outlandish copywriting. The restaurant comes across as a parody straight out of SNL, but it's real.   The parmageddon wings suffered from breading that was too thick and an overpowering parmesan flavor. The mac n cheese burger had so many flavors and ingredients that the beef patty was lost. And, by lost I mean the flavor. The patty itself was a mess -- weirdly shaped and thin as if a child assembled it then someone ran it over. No wonder they call it a meat blanket. The bun was great, but the rest of the burger was just an odd tasting mess. The order came with a mix of skinny, handcut, and waffle fries, all of which were pretty good.  Expect long waits because of Guy's popularity. It's Applebee's on steroids. While it is a kid-friendly restaurant they don't have a kid's menu, meaning that little ones that will eat about five bites will have to order an adult sized item and will likely have plenty of leftovers.",

Service gets an A+ the server was prompt, checked on me frequently, and was very sweet. Do Not order coffee- even after three sugars and half a pitcher of cream, it tasted like motor oil- absolutely undrinkable. (There is a Starbucks across the path.)",

He took our orders relatively quickly and got our drinks and food out fast, but it seemed I needed to wait for drink refills and when I asked for more ranch he seemed annoyed. Other than the basic service provided he did not seem to want to do much else.   Food: the food was great! I ordered the spring roll wraps... Or something like that.. Anyway, it was delish! Definitely yummy even for my daughter who shared my plate with me! She loved all of it!!! My husband ordered the Mac and cheese burger, this was juicy and absolutely mouthwatering! I think I will go back for the plate I ordered, it was a little more expensive than what we usually like to pick up, but very yummy! Good date night place!",

According to the menu, their Mac N Cheese burger was rated as the number one burger by SEVEN magazine. This burger sorely disappointing. The mac n cheese was lacking in flavor. The beef was cooked well done and the waiters did not even ask how I wanted the burger cooked. In addition, the bacon strip in the burger tasted like it was old and had been cooked hours earlier. $20 for this burger was a huge disappointment. The one thing that was actually pretty good were the fireball wings. I do recommend that you try those.",

She was nice and attentive and when I ordered a strong drink that I didn't like too much, she offered to get me another one or offered to make it sweeter. The food was good, you can't go wrong with nachos and wings. Overall experience was good. Try the cucamelon drink! so good :)",

Luckily, we got here early enough to where we didn't need to wait longer than 2 minutes for a table to accommodate our party size( we were 7 people ).  Our waiter immediately came over and took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to skim over the menu. We decided to start with appetizers and then order our entrees after a little while. We  started with the Trashcan nachos, fries and tacos as our appetizers. While we were waiting we were consistently distracted by different waiters walking by carrying humongous burgers over to the other diners so we were really excited to see what was in store for us when our order arrived. When our food came we all dug in but weren't really impressed. I personally could not tell any difference from this restaurant to any normal bar. Our appetizers were also so heavy we didn't have any room in our stomachs to order any main entrees. We walked away paying about $80 for 7 people which pretty reasonable but left feeling disgusting full. This is definitely not the greatest spot in Vegas, but if you're nearby and hungry its work checking out.",

    "text": "Our visit was thoroughly mediocre. It was just a stop in for a bite to eat very shortly after landing in the city. There was a pretty long wait ~40 mins so we retreated to the bar. On the way you notice half the tables are empty. Not a big deal, as I'm sure it's staff based, but that doesn't seem ideal. I sat dead center at the bar. There was this lingering smell you would get whiffs of strongly, with it just hanging in the back of your nose. A dumpster.... You know, like when you are behind a building, in an alley, and the trash truck let's that water and liquid leak out on the ground; the conglomeration of various things that fester in the bottom of the bin....that smell. Not a compliment to a meal.. Or in this case just a drink. Somehow the couple adjacent ate food. We got to go to the table after we confirmed the hostess never really put us on the list in the first place, and with most of the tables empty you could see how dirty the place is...plenty of crumbs and grime. The place does have that rustic rebel vibe going on, but it's just a little too authentic to have real grime. Our party of 5 ordered various items; a couple salads, one sandwich, and two apps. Nobody was very wowed but probably famished from the flight. I had the app with the lettuce wraps because lettuce wraps rock! These did NOT. Bland, weird, gross chicken.... Like it was boiled or something. In contrast the spring rolls and little chicken skewer on the plate were rather tasty. Odd dish. I think Guy should stop by this dive and have a taste. On a side note, one of these stars is for the sugared bacon in the Bloody Mary. Maybe just order a plate of that.",

I would say it's worth a try if you like Mac-N-Cheese. My fiance had a standard burger with bacon and he added an egg to it and he was in heaven. I have to say the burger itself is very good. Well seasoned and cooked perfectly to both of our likings.  We wanted to try the desert but were running late. Maybe next time. As for the rating...I bumped a star off because our waiter was slow getting our orders to us and served other parties that were larger than our party of two and they sat down 15 minutes after us.  Hopefully they will be better about that next time.",

Minus one star because the waiter didn't tell us that the two person tables in the outdoor seating area weren't under the misters.  In 110 degrees it was very hot outside!! Definitely take the wait for indoor seating.  On the plus side- food was really good.  I would go back just for the brisket nachos!! I usually skip the side of fries, but I'm glad I didn't.  The side of fries had shoestring, waffle, curly, and something else.  So good! I had the regular burger, and it was pretty great.

As far as the burger , the fries would be the only thing I'd recommend. This burger tasted identical to sonic , from the lettuce to the paper thin patty also not worth my 20$  - save save save your money.  Stick to eating the food guy not creating it- also there are no restrooms in the restaurant , you have to walk inside to the casino and stand in the lines with all of the other hotel guests",

Overpriced food for garbage . We could have been at a 5 star restaurant for what we paid there. Never again and will not recommend this place to others. Chefs are not holding True to the original menu and service was horrible.",

The first time was last year around the same time and the food was excellent we got the pulled pork sandwich it was amazing we are excited to come back this year and get the same thing. This visit was different, first my husband had lipstick on his water glass when it came out... brought it to the attention of the manager he inspected it and stated that it was not lipstick. Like okay why argue with the customer just get him a new glass not a big deal but it just kind of pissed me off that he argued against it. Then we ordered the appetizer and pulled pork sandwich to split between the two of us the appetizer came out it tasted good but then the pulled pork sandwich came out and it was dry AF but since we split it my husband's half was okay so he did want to send it back so I had to suffer lol. Anyways I feel like the food and service has gone down since last year so that sucks I was really looking forward to eating there since I love Guy Fieri maybe I'll try it again next year and they will have different management",

Upon arrival we were told there was a 30 minute wait, even though there were a ton of tables open. This was fine though, because I won enough at the casino while waiting to pay for my meal :-)  My friends had the trash can nachos which they could not stop raving about. We all shared the lobster lollipops which were completely worth the price tag.  For my meal I had the turkey burger. The patty was huge and not dry at all. I loved the toppings, however the bun was a let down. It was very dry and fell apart as I tried to eat it.  Overall, a really great experience! Thank you guy",

We ordered the Trash Can Nachos ($19.50) and Pulled Pork Sandwich ($21.5).  Our nachos came out first and they were ok. Better than nachos we've had at other restaurants but definitely something that we would not re-order. If you are an avid nacho lover, I'd suggest passing on this. Especially for $19.50, we were expecting some really amazing nachos.  The pulled pork sandwich was great. The pickles + coleslaw + pulled pork in the pretzel bread was really good. But the sandwich was not good enough for me to want to go back there.  However, the fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting out for a loooooooong time. They were not fresh or hot. When we left, we passed by the kitchen and I saw one of the cooks dish out the fries for upcoming orders from a large metal bowl. (Note: the metal bowl had a lot of fries and didn't seem to be freshly made.)  Service was surprisingly slow despite there not being many tables filled at this point. Our server took a very long time at each drink refill and overall just seemed to only be able to do one thing at a time and one table at a time. She didn't clear the nacho plates when we were done. After taking our bill and card as well as another nearby table's, she returned that table's card and bill but not ours. Took another 5 mins before we got our card back.",

It's a thick patty with actual mac and cheese instead of a slice of cheese, and topped with slices of bacon. It was almost as tasty and memorable as the first time I had it.   We were seated immediately. I was shocked at how easy it was to get in at 11:30am on a Saturday! Our server was friendly and chatted with us and checked on us frequently.   My husband and i decided to get a fishbowl drink to share (we're in Vegas and not driving, might as well get tipsy!). We got a strawberry coconut drink that was amazing. It came with rum infused strawberries which were great to share with our friends at the table. This place has great food, a clean fast restaurant and a good staff.

The wait is pretty long, the waitress told us about 40minutes; understandable though because it was Saturday night around 6:30 in the middle of the strip! So we decided to sit in the bar. Service was ok, took them couple minutes to greet us and cleaned dishes in front of us and there were 4 bartenders around. Anyway, we only drank couple  shots of fire ball and couple vodka soda so couldn't really say the quality of their mix drinks but from the menu we saw there was quiet a lot of mix drinks.   Moving on the the food: we ordered a Mac and cheese burger, it was delicious! Burger patty was juicy, Mac and cheese in it was really moist and seasoned well, buns was also very moist and not dry but not overly buttered either. So after all we are pleased on how the food was cooked.   Happy hours was awesome. If you didn't know drinking on the strip can be very expensive. So with happy hours it was a steal! Our check came out at $70 I believe; with couple shots and couple vodka soda and food and it being on kn the strip that's pretty cheap! Overall good experience!  Came back today!! Next day!! And got some poke tacos and lollipops lobster.. and that tacos is THE BOMB!!!!! Got Better service too!! And man, that tacos they really thought of textures and taste seriously. We asked for sour cream and seriously it was really delicious, tasty and almost close to perfection!! Definitely will be back for more tacos!!",

Well things didn't turn out how I thought it would.    Our waitress was a bit over whelmed.  Service was really bad and slow. We ordered several items from the menu:   Lobster Lollipops - sever dropped one of the lollipops, but did offer to bring us one over.  Which he did as he walked through the restaurant with the one lollipop about 10 min later.  Not even on a plate.  First encounter.  Trash Can Nachos - Nachos were super cold and barely any cheese on them.  It took 20 minutes for someone to come over not even our waitress for us to inform them.   Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger - Burger was so sloppy and wet that the buns just fell apart.  Our waitress still didn't come back to the table to check on us.   The Original Ringer Burger - was good no complaints. This is the only reason I have it 2 rating.   Finally our waitress came over to inform us that her shift was ending and someone else would be closing out our tab.  The manager never came over to see if everything was ok.  Truly disappointed in the visit.    I've visited this location several times and this was the worst.  Left a bad taste and not sure that I would go back.",

The burger was good, but no better than anywhere else I've been. And we spent more here on burgers and fries than we spent at every other restaurant during our week long vacation. I will not be back and I cannot recommend.",

The burgers were really dry and appetizers were so so.  They were out of one of the ingredients for a house specialty drink. Tables were dirty. Guy needs to make a trip to his restaurant to see how subpar it is.",

    "text": "I was skeptical given the poor reviews and the menu I had looked over and passed on...however, we had a comp to use and had guests that wanted to go, so we did.    I was pretty impressed given the location and celebrity chef status...anticipated, mediocre and overpriced food.   It ended up a pretty decent value given those specifics.  Ordered the $33 rack of ribs...which was basically 3 half racks (6 meaty, moist bones) plated w yummy moist jalapeno corn cakes and mac n cheese, creamy topped w onion straws.  Shared this w my mom, really whole table ate off it.  You could smell the ribs being slow cooked when you walked in, so if people don't enjoy bbq smell, lol.  Was surprised by the texas decor.  Also ordered the bleu cheese burger, had a lot of creamy bleu cheese, great for me, might be a bit much for others.    Also ordered the mac n cheese burger...huge and shareable served w seasoned house fries included...rare for a celeb place to have sandwiches include fries.  I will not say sides because there were no sides, which is strange and my one complaint.....the menu was too limited.  I am not a burger person anyway, but 3 burgers and 3 flavors of wings and a few random things thrown on for good measure just doesn't make sense, except that he wants a limited menu to turn over tables quickly without a lot of kitchen prep.  Disappointed that a man whose job it is to find the tastiest menu items in the country has this menu....but the menu itself was well implemented.  We did not get to try any of the wings.  Again, reiterating that everything was flavorful and \"high end\", not a here's a 3 dollar burgar, add my name and pay 16.    Portions and location made this a pretty good value, so add celeb name and I call it a good value.  Also ordered the smores monte cristo....good, reminded me of a funnel cake w chocolate.  Shared w 5.  Dipping choc was delish.  I would order again.    The menu turned me off several times before finally just going.  It doesn't sound as appealing as it was.",

French toast was amazing and served with a banana brulee that could have been a dish all to itself.  Eggs sausage dish was equally good.  All breakfasts are served with a watermelon juice shot that is a nice way to finish the meal.  Michael, the manager, stopped for a visit at our table.  Had a very friendly chat about other Food Network chefs in Vegas as well as a very informative discussion about the coffee.  I am a bit of a coffee snob and often find restaurant coffee fair at best. Guy's coffee is great and specially shipped to them from a roaster on the west coast. I hate to pay $35 dollars for breakfast, but this was worth every penny!!",

Price is comparable to anywhere else on the strip for similar food. Items on the menu running about $15 each. I'm giving 3 stars because the service was horrible. Long waits, no refills on drinks, and mistakes on bill. They were very busy the night we went but a place on the strip should be prepared to be busy on a Saturday evening. There were quite a few employees just standing around talking. Dissapointing.",

    "text": "Actual rating 3.75 stars. I had some friends in town and wanted to give this place another chance.   I was feeling adventurous and tried the smoke and mirrors.fireball cinnamon whisky, fresh lemon juice, apple & cherry Juice dash of lagavulin single malt I really enjoyed this drink.   For food starters we split the Fondue Dippers, crisp breadsticks wrapped with pepperoni and an amazing provolone and sausage cheese dip. The breadsticks were forgettable but the dip was fantastic.  We took the manager's advice and kept the dip for our fries later. For my entree I went with the 67 Cajun sandwich. From the menu \" This one packs a punch! It's crammed with blackened chicken, Andouille sausage, cheddar cheese, the creole trinity + Louisiana hot sauce.\" I got the hot sauce on the side.  The chicken, sausage and cheese were excellent.  I was a bit disappointed with the hot sauce as it tasted more buffalo than cajun but because I had it on the side, I was able to dip into the provolone dip.  The bread was a little chewy and didn't add anything to the dish but didn't hurt it either.  What struck me about this visit was the shrimp tacos that were skimpy and bland the first time we came were smothered in shrimp this time.  My friend enjoyed them.  The mac and cheese burger was also a hit with my other dining mate.  The fries remain the hit though and I still get a kick out of the different fries mixed together.    For desert we had the smores.  a monte cristo style desert that rocked.  We couldn't finish it between the three of us because we were stuffed.  Finally, I commend the service again.  Colie (sp?) was an excellent waitress with a sharp wit and happy to make suggestions.  Colie really took this up to the fourth star.    We also got to meet Chef Kyle and the managers and I am really impressed with their commitment to the restaurant's success and desire for it to stand on its own.    Try it for yourself, it has a lot to offer!",

We sat at the bar and started with the famous Bloody Mary! Even though it wasn't on the menu we had seen it on Food Network and wanted to try it. This drink is half appetizer, half cocktail. Very fun and the \"garnishes\" compliment the excellent Bloody Mary!  After striking up a conversation with the bartender we got free oatmeal cookie shots and they were delicious!!  I got the original burger and my girlfriend got the turkey sandwich. The turkey sandwich was a bit underwhelming and the burger was okay (ordered medium, came our medium well at best). Just a lot of things going on flavor-wise that are competing for your attention.  Service was about average but the bartender was very friendly. The atmosphere was very fun and casual.  Overall, this place is solid. I would recommend this restaurant if you are a fan of Guy Fieri and want a hearty meal. Citizens of Flavortown, unite!! I",

So, from the table setup to the quality of the utensils and linens you can see \"someone put great though into all the details ! Myself and GF visited twice during a four day run Vegas. The lines were about 30-45 min, they text you\" so it's no big deal. The burger and fries rocked, chicken wings were good \" just bit undercooked and cold. Both visits the service staff was top notch and on it 100% . I will add this to must visit every time in Vegas. Thanks Roland",

I wasnt.   We came at a busy time so we opted to take the first seats available. Too bad that meant we had to sit outside. With the misters and fans on, the heat was bearable.   I had the beef brisket plate. The meat was very dry, and it did not have enough sauce.  The fries were good, it was a mixture of crispy seasoned fries, crinkle fries fries, and chiplike fries. The toast it came with was okay, nothing special at all. As for the coleslaw that was atop the brisket, it was just that. Sliced up cabbage with what seemed like no dressing.   What i did in fact enjoy, was my 9 year old neice's $35 steak. It was quite good but judging from the fact that a little girl was able to finish the plate, it was not quite worth the money.   Would i come back? Maybe not.",

    "text": "This place is highly overrated; average food at best. I remembered seeing a video on social media for the infamous \"trash can nachos\" and since we were staying at the Linq, we decided to check this place out. For a party of 2, we were quoted 25-30 minutes on Saturday night. It took about 15 minutes and we were texted that our table was ready. Drinks were average. Service was average. Food was average at best. We ordered the trash can nachos, double-barrel wings, and lobster pops. There was nothing memorable about any of it. I was excited to video the \"trash can\" removal when the plates were brought out, but the girl didn't  allow the time to do so. She just took it off without a care while flinging some of the chips onto the floor beside me. It wasn't our server, but the girl who brought out the food. The presentation was very disappointing. Once the can was off, there was no point in a photo. No biggie; I was more interested in the taste anyway. That's what let me down. It was pulled pork with some sort of queso/bbq/chipotle sauce which I was excited to try. My husband loved it. Me, not so much. All in all, I wouldn't dine here again. Most of the other entrees I saw folks ordering around me were burgers and more \"trash can nachos\". There's many MUCH BETTER options when dining in Vegas. Don't waste your time (or your taste-buds) here.   P.S. There's a Jack Daniels chocolate cake on the dessert menu that looked very enticing. But, after the lackluster meal, we decided against it.",

The BBQ sauce was a bit overpowering at times but a small swipe to the side with a fork took care of any extra BBQ sauce. The brisket itself was tender with a delicious smoked flavor. I love garlic toast so it was pleasing to have two thick slices under the brisket.  Last was the Dragon breath chili cheese fries I shared amongst friends. I couldn't quite figure out the flavor of Guy's chili in terms of seasoning but it was good stuff. There's nothing better than good chili, which now prompts me to try his chili bowl with sweet corn bread my next go round for lunch or dinner.   Service was excellent as usual. I still have yet to have bad service and I'm sure it'll stay that way. Another great ending to a Vegas trip at Guy Fieri's.  Lunch 6/7/2015",

The truffle fries are delicious, but there was no plain option (although I'm sure you could ask). The fries that came with my veggie burger even had an unexpected plain and BBQ mix. The veggie burger was pretty good, but was an uncommon concoction of olives and various legumes.  All in all, if you're a Guy Fierir fan, a BBQ fan, or enjoy a quirky heavy take on your favorite American dishes, this is the place for you. Otherwise maybe just stick with a nice cocktail.",

    "text": "I cannot recommend the churros enough! You have not lived until you've tasted the sugary deep-fried cinnamon sweetness of Guy Fieri's Mexican Churros ($11 with Total Rewards Card). It's all about that dulce de leche dip, man! I could live without the spicy chocolate dip, but I won't let that take away from the overall awesomeness of my favorite spot for churros.   Excuse my ravings. Now, here's the nitty gritty. Guy Fieri's menu has changed very frequently since my first to this restaurant in the Quad. Prices have gone up $2-3 on all menu items and apparently they've gotten rid of their nachos (lame). Here are my main gripes:  1) They charge $4 for a fountain drink. Really?! 2) The tables are dirty. The tables that have the wood planks on them have tons of food/random sauce wedged in the cracks. Eww. 3) The uniforms of the staff are hideous. They're a tacky denim/Western getup. I hate them. No one likes a \"Denim Dan\". 4) Guy Fieri's is extremely unfriendly for vegetarians, unless you order fries or a salad, which isn't really food. Hence my preference for eating at Guy's mostly for dessert only.   Okay, now for the good stuff. Everything is presented as an edible masterpiece. Guy's WINS for presentation. Also, the portions are ginormous. Yay! The Caesar salad ($14) is a goodie. There's plenty for two and it can serve as an entree in its own right. The dressing is on the thicker side and the Parmesan cheese was scrumptious. My husband and I had to do the \"push away\" to save room for our main course.   When Guy's used to have nachos on the menu, those were great too. Very creative and extremely cheesy. The chef's spared no expense on loading the nachos up with ooey gooey cheese!  The jalapenos were my favorite part! Somehow they had an almost sweet taste to them.   My husband ordered the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger ($19). He barely put a dent in it, it was so huge. He was quite pleased with his burger.   We did order the Guy's Cheesecake Challenge ($13), once. It's overrated. I'm not really a cheesecake person anyways, so don't mind me. I just gave it a shot because so many people were raving about it, I thought, well if it's so good maybe I'll like cheesecake this one time. No such magical moment happened. I didn't like the potato chips or the pretzels shoved in the cheesecake. They tasted stale. The cheesecake itself just didn't do it for me. Oh well.   Service has always been great or average. We usually come on Monday or Tuesday nights, so the wait time is under 10 minutes.   In sum, I like Guy's. The food is fun. To be honest though, I'll probably only eat here for dessert whenever I feel like splurging.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this place has such low ratings! I was thoroughly impressed.  LOCATION: It's located in the LINQ, which you can access from the strip or if you park you have to go through the Casino towards the back of the hotel.    WAIT: We came on a Saturday morning around 10:30am and there was no wait! There is a lot of seating at the bar, in the restaurant and outside.    ATMOSPHERE: Lots of TVs and general casual, fun atmosphere.  It definitely feels like a diner/bar restaurant.  FOOD: I got 2 things here and both were good, breakfast items.  CHICKEN BACON BISCUITS AND GRAVY - it comes with scrambled eggs but we changed it to poached and it was a great idea, the ooze on the egg yolk was on point.  We were a little confused at first because we didnt see any chicken.  It turns out the meat is actually one large thick piece of bacon that is covered in fried chicken skin.  It was very good, not overly salty and tasty.  The biscuits are big (reminded me of hash house) and the gravy wasn't too overwhelming.  They give you more on the side if you need extra gravy.  Overall a solid dish shareable between 2 people.  BREAKFAST BURRITO - also shareable as it's pretty large.  Comes with fresh tortilla chips and guac all taste freshly made.  The burrito is a quesarrito so the outside tortilla is a quesadilla itself, which is amazing.  Lots of filling inside, very tasty and not that spicy despite having chorizo.  Also a great option if you're in the mood for a breakfast burrito.  Overall, I enjoyed this place and would definitely come back to try their lunch.  Their breakfast was not a disappointment.",

A delicious cocktail that included everything in it. 2 different types of rum, passion fruit, pineapple juice, orange juice lime juice, grenadine.   For the entree my friend recommended the bacon mac and cheese burger. Omg, it was amazing and I was definitely in heaven eating this thing. Seriously imagine a huge burger with mac and cheese in it. One of the best parts was the burgers come with fries. No extra charge! & not just fries but a variety. Truffle fries, onion rings, and regular fries, so you get to try a little bit of everything. Genius! What's not to love! Everything was really pricy here but you get what you pay for! & it was definitely well worth it. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas. =)",

    "text": "This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...  Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.  I liked it enough to want to go again.  Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.  Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.  I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back.   Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.  I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)  Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake.",

I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos as an app. They had no flavor and a stale shell. The burger I ordered was pretty good though, and it was ENORMOUS. It's probably big enough to feed 3 people. Also, their homemade ranch dressing was outstanding.",

We sat at the bar and shared their chilaquiles. The only reason we didn't think it was 5 stars was because we ordered the Kicked Up Caddy (a margarita with both Cointreau and Grand Marnier). However we saw the bartender use Triple Sec instead of Cointreau. I asked about it and she confirmed that she used Triple Sec but didn't offer to remake it. Then we didn't see her the rest of our breakfast.  Side note: there aren't any bathrooms in the restaurant itself. You have to walk through the casino a little bit to use them.",

We tired the day before to get in but the wait was simply too long so we decided to try again, and while it was again 45-1hour we decided to wait. They sent us a text about 30 minutes later that our table was ready and to come in within 5 minutes to keep the reservation. We made it quick lol.  It was around 10pm so the normal menu had changed to the limited late night menu (changes at 9:45pm) but it was still well worth it. It was my siblings and I and we all were craving a burger and fries so thats exactly what we all ordered.   It came in a timely manner and it was delicious!! We all enjoyed it so much we barely said a word during dinner. Just ate in silence. Fires are the only reason why they are not getting a 5/5 form me because they were just kinda weird. Three of us got some skinny, some wedges, and some normal and the other two got only one of a kind. Kinda weird and unexpected.   Would absolutely come back when visiting again in Vegas!",

    "text": "My family had eaten here months earlier and enjoyed it so I wanted to try it.  I didn't know where the restaurant was, and walked down the LINQ Promenade looking for it.  Once we walked around LINQ, we saw it on the corner across from Harrah's.  We accessed the entrance from inside which was a narrow hall.  The hostess let us know it could be a 45 min. wait and we said ok, and then she said it could be faster.  There are 2 small benches outside of the hostess area in dark corners, as well as one seating area by the hostess stand.  It took about 10 minutes and we were shown to our table with booth and chair seating.  We were close enough to our neighbours that we could touch them.  The menu seemed to have changed from my family's visit as the food they ordered wasn't on it.  I decided to get the pulled pork sandwich and although it's not listed, it comes with different cut fries or a salad.  That's good as most of the sandwiches and burgers are between $15-20.    The food comes out fast! It was probably less than 5 minutes after ordering and I noticed that most people around us also got their food quickly.  The pork was nicely seasoned but tasted a little greasy on the bun.  The fries were good and I liked the crinkle cut ones.  The portion was big and I took half my sandwich to go, but we wanted to try the dessert.  Our dessert was a mountain of mint ice cream covered with chocolate sauce, cookies, and large chocolate chips.  It was hard as you make your way to the middle of the dessert but better than melting.  The server couldn't believe we were able to finish it! This is a dessert that can be shared between 4!   It's loud with the TVs showing the football games and music playing on the speakers.    The service to order dessert and refill water was slow.  We had a 10% coupon from our hotel but the server gave us 20% off instead.  The food was good, and comes out fast and big! Come hungry!",

The Ugly!!! - The Bacon Mac and Cheese Burger! - A soggy Mess! had the kitchen Split the burger in half - Opps! - My half did not contain any burger. The meat portion was skimpy but cooked very well.  Overall - Extremely disappointed - for a $20 burger the value was not there.   Guy - You are Fieried!! - A Flaming Disappointment",

I had the double Bar-B-Q wings, which had great sauce and great homemade ranch but the wings left a lot to be desired. The wings were very tough with a lot of cartilage & fat. Our server was Daniel, service was super slow and he was not very polite at all. I can't say I don't recommend this place as I'm torn. I would not get any wings and would ask to sit in another section besides Daniels. The desserts looked awesome but we did not get any due to th ed slowness of our service. We had 2 people sit next to us 10 minutes after we arrived and get more food including ribs, they were paid and gone before we were . Got to improve the wings and service if you want people to return!",

We came across a familiar name that we know must be good, Guy Fieri. Luckily, we weren't waiting long to be seated. Since it was such a warm night, we opted to sit outside. Our party ordered drinks and the chicken wings for appetizers. The wings were delicious so I was expecting amazing things from the main course. I ordered the Blackened Cajun chicken and sausage with fries. The fries had 3 cuts in the order: shoestring, regular and waffle. The fries were delicious, but I was so let down by the chicken/sausage sandwich. It was super salty that I didn't even taste anything else but the salt. Other the epic fail on my main dish, everything else was awesome. I am willing to come back and try something different. This is a great edition to the Las Vegas Strip.",

The donkey sauce is delicious and I only wish I could have finished that burger because it was so damn good.   The drinks were good but a little weak for my liking. The flavors in them are great and very pronounced but it was hard to tell if they were weak or just that the flavors overpowered the alcohol.   I really like the decor as well as the sugar skull napkins and nice cutlery.

They have outdoor seating, but when we asked it was a1/2 wait , so indoors was our choice.  We found seating tight and the room cold. So cold, as I watched the hostess seat guests she put on a hoodie to keep warm. The coffee came and hoping that would warm me up but it was not hot either. The breakfast menu is limited to 8 items but the add-on for a custom Bloody Mary top 15 choices! We ordered, endured the chilly room, but  the wait was as we were on Guy's TV show Triple  G as it took a  1/2 hour for them to shop, cook and plate our entrees! The big bonus was the food was fantastic. Lastly it was funny to watch our server reaching over patrons to serve other tables or as in our case just to get us our check. I feel it would have been a better experience if we sat outside.",

The patio area is nice for hanging out and people-watching.  Unfortunately, nothing that we ordered was good.  Starting with the drinks:  my friend ordered the Smoke and Mirrors cocktail.  It had a beautiful presentation with a small pepper garnish.  It tasted like cough syrup.  I got the Rebel Dragon--not very good either.  For appys, we ordered the Triple T fries (kind of bland) and the BBQ wings.  I got the Drunken Fish Tacos for my entree, and my friend got the Big Dipper Sandwich.  All of the food was kind of bland and underwhelming.  Not what I expected from Guy Fieri.  I was so disappointed.  The service was good, but I don't think that I will be returning because it was such a lackluster meal.",

We sat in the outdoor area on hard wood bench seats and had to wait 30+ minutes to get our food. It took the waitress three trips to deliver the proper number of waters to a table of 7. After that point we paced ourselves on our drinks because we didn't know when the waitress would be back for refills.  While waiting for our food, a waiter passed by our table carrying trays and ended up dropping them, splashing sauces on a member of my party--all on her arm, with spots on her shirt and shorts. The waiter did say sorry and bring wet towels, but when asked if we'd get discounted for an entree he said, \"this happens all the time\". Wow, no \"I'll ask my manager\" or even an offer for a free desert...nothing.  When our food finally did come out the waiter first delivered to the wrong table. The food tastes great with good-sized portions, but I don't think I'd go back or recommend it to a friend.",

We decided to order the onion rings, Smash Burger and the Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger. The onion rings were lightly breaded and highly seasoned. It came with a dipping sauce and the onions were sweet. The presentation of it was really cool as it came hanging on a board and pipe. The Smash Burger was my favorite because it has the most flavor, beef was perfectly cooked and those homemade thin pickles just made it even more tasty. My husband had the Bacon Mac N Cheeseburger, it was HUGE! It tasted good, but it was a little too much for me and didn't have too much flavor. Other than that, definitely a must try for all the die hard Triple D Fans!",

    "text": "I love burgers, especially the more gourmet kind. we went here recently for an early dinner and split  a burger and an order of the spicy Asian wings. First of all I loved the plating, enjoyed the outdoor seating and the servers were friendly and prompt. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. I would happily have eaten there again the next day but we wanted to try new places. Honestly I have eaten a lot of great burgers but this is one of the best, it was WAY better than Gorden Ramseys BurgR at Planet Hollywood ( burgers here were good but nothing memorable at all). I would say the Guy Fieri is comparably good as Umami or the Counter which I believe are some of the best burger joints on the upscale end.  Go. Go immediately.",

The staff was friendly but inattentive after we ordered. We both got the Mac-n-cheese bacon cheeseburger with a side salad and the triple truffle fries. We thought the fries would come out first, but it was under \"Shareables\" on the menu and they came out with the rest of the food. The fries were cold and our burgers were lukewarm. We sent the fries back and when we told the waiter he didn't apologize or anything, just took them back and got us another order. The second time they were hot and pretty good. I would recommend them. We weren't offered ketchup or salt and pepper, which we could have definitely used. The burger was alright and probably would have been awesome if it wasn't cold. I asked for it without onions but there were onions when it arrived, not a huge deal cause I just picked them off. The tomatoes were sliced so thin you couldn't taste them. The salad was something I would throw together at home, just iceberg lettuce and some carrots. Overall I was not impressed with the food or the service.",

Maybe I was comparing them to much like my Mexican mother in law's.  But then I look over and there is a couple drinking coffee with creamer.

Fast forwarding to our order- Sashimi won-tacos: I like how it had mango-jicama salsa. Pretty tasty, and prob best thing ordered General's wings: Was hesitant on these but surprisingly not bad! Triple B Burger: it was ok. I know that their Mac n cheese burgers is what their known for, so I guess if you wanted a burger here I'd probably order that Morgan's gnarly Greek salad: I added chicken on this salad. They were chicken skewers, and again the chicken was nice. Salad was okay, I wish they put more hummus on it because it was basically just dolloped onto the plate and piled romaine lettuce on top.  Bloody Mary: I don't think anywhere can f*ck up a Bloody Mary.  It was nice tryin you guy!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this....I HATE super chef restaurants.  They're tourist traps designed to give the impression that you are getting the experience of the chef's vision.  After looking at the menu, I think it was derived more from Fieri's agent than the from him.  Here's how the convo probably went when they were conceiving the restaurant idea:  Restaurant Owner - I watch the show all the time....so I guess it'll  be a menu of some burgers , meatloaf, and pulled pork.  Agent -  Yeah.  Sure.  Restaurant Owner - Ummm....did he tell you what he though should be on the menu?  Agent - Naw.  Not really.  Restaurant Owner - Okkkkk.......  **awkward silence**  Agent - I dunno.  Take something from Appleby's, Cici's, and Red Robin and that should be the menu.  I don't have time to look through all of the shows to break that down.  I got 18 holes in about 45 minutes.  Restaurant Owner -  Ok, but what about drinks?  Hello?  Hello?  The menu was unimaginative to me.  I took me a long time to decide because I wanted some greens or some sort and the nothing on the menu stood out.  I only tasted a few dishes; the Montgomery salad, the some-fancy-named nachos, and the firewall wings.  The salad was good; very good in fact.  The nachos were over the top to a fault. Any type of loaded nachos should be a medley not cutesy.  Regular tortilla chips, chili. onions, jalepenos, beef.  Done.  Their nachos were supposed to have simmered beef.  That night, they were out, but offered chili as a replacement.  Bad choice.  The chili was no where near the quality it was supposed to be for that price as a replacement for the beef.  The chips were too fancy for dish as well.  Remember what I wrote about a medley?  Yeah, there wasn't one.  My wings were tasty sauce-wise, but it was hard to really enjoy it as I was worried after each bite since each wing had a touch of pink on the inside.  The only reason I didn't send them back was because typically when a cook doesn't cook chicken enough, he/she only knows how to under-cook it or burn it.  I kissed it to God and kept it moving.  I ordered a pitcher of blackberry sangria.  $45 whole American dollars.  Was it good? Yes.  Was it $45 good, not even close.  Personally, I don't thing there are any restaurants on the strip or in the casinos that are worth the money.  Guy Fieri's is just one of them.",

It consisted of fried tortilla chips coated in some type of hot sauce, with carne Asada, two sunny eggs, avacado, some fried chili's, and a grilled lime on top. The food tasted as good as I would expect from a place with Guy Fieri's name on it. For me I would rate the food I had 4 stars.  The service was somewhat lacking. I feel in Las Vegas there are so many other places with a similar place point that just to it better. It wasn't abysmal by any means, just not quite what I expected. Some of the things I would mark them down for my seem little, but in my opinion that is what separates ok from world class. First it took 28 minutes to receive the food.( this may have been a kitchen issue, but the place was only 75% full). That may not have been on the server, but what was on the server is he didn't check on my beverages until it had been 25 minutes. Then an expo brought the food, but no silverware. The server then came and checked on my food within 1 minute of it being dropped off. That's great but I hadn't even had a chance to take a bite. He never checked again. What if I needed any condiments or it wasn't satisfactory? Thankfully it was good. Lastly it took 12 minutes from when I finished until the server asked if I needed anything else it if I wanted my check. Also not one employee I walked past smiled or gave any type greeting.  Overall I would still recommend because the food met expectations. Maybe today was just an off day for the service.",

Ridiculous way to run a business. Seated right away at yard house and thrilled to give them my money. Much more pleasant and no wait. Sorry Guy, your place stinks.",

We went last Wednesday night, had to wait 30 minutes on a table so we went to the bar, 2 cocktails later and our total was $32 and I didn't even like mine. I think it was called Jamo and Ginger but the ginger was overwhelming, made the drink extremely bitter.   So now our meal. We decided to share the Mac and cheese burger and ice cream sundae. The burger looked amazing, and I really wanted to love it, but something was missing. In theory, Mac and cheese would be delicious on a burger. I thought it would be melty and gooey and act like a cheese for the burger...it didn't. When paying $20 for  a burger and fries, I'd expect it to make the top 5...it didn't. Not even close. The fries were ok but I wasn't a fan of the seasoning they put on them.   The dessert, however, fantastic. I mean you probably can't go wrong with fried ice cream but this one was great. Crunchy corn flakes surrounding a giant mound of vanilla ice cream then served with all the fixings. My favorite was the bananas and peanut butter.",

Ever spend $16 on a side of French fries?!  The $20 Bacon Mac -n- Cheese burger looked and sounded awesome...... unfortunately it didn't have any flavor........ couldn't even tell there was mac and cheese on the burger really.  It was a disappointment!  They have the music turned up SO LOUD IN THE PLACE THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK TO THE PEOPLE AT YOUR TABLE.   I get it.... play some cool music but SERIOUSLY??  YOU ARE TRYING TOO HARD TO BE COOL IF YOUR SERVERS HAVE TO YELL SO THE CUSTOMERS CAN HEAR THEM!!  So annoying....  come on Guy!!",

He is a Vegas native so what better way to experience bold flavours and unique dishes than his very own kitchen and bar in his hometown!  We arrived for a late dinner at approximately 9:00 p.m. and there was still a 45 minute wait so we opted for immediate seating at the bar where they still serve the full menu. The service was mediocre enough to mention in this review - what bar in Vegas doesn't try to attempt to top up your drink?! We had empty glasses sitting at the bar for far too long. There were 3 bartenders at the time of our meal and no one even came to check up on us.  Honourable mention goes to the award winning Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger. It was voted \"Best Burger in Vegas\" by several magazines and a must try if you come here. Taking my first bite felt just like I was on an episode of DDD, grease and bacon fat oozing from the burger onto my fingers and all! It is a healthy portion so if you aren't starving (or hungover), I would recommend sharing this dish along with an appetizer.   Despite the overall rating, it was still worth the visit and experience.",

    "text": "I am right on the cusp of a 4-star review, unfortunately the service we received knocked it down to a 3-star.   We went there on May 12th for my 30th birthday, this was my choice and I did not even complain when we had to wait 10-15min for an outdoor table when we could've been seated right away inside. The girls at the front were all wicked nice and greeted us right away and were helpful. There was a band playing next door so it did make conversation a little difficult but nothing too bad, and the people watching was the best part of being outside.   The food for the most part was delicious. I got a Smoke & Mirrors for my drink, which besides the giant pepper on the glass was delicious. For appetizers we got Righteous Rojo Rings and Guy-talian Fondue Dippers, the sauce for the rings was awesome nice and spicy. The dippers were also wicked good, my mom started making them at home, just can't get the dip right! For my meal I got Carne Asada Street Tacos, which were okay. The filling was very good but the thing I did not like was that the tacos seemed to be wrapped with two soft taco shells which were really really really dry. The best part was the dessert, the Triple Doublemint Pie, which was shared amongst all four of us because it was definitely too large for one person.  Our server is what killed this whole experience. I am not sure where she kept on disappearing to but she brought our drinks and then ran off for almost 20min before taking any part of our order. Then after our meal it took awhile before she even asked if we wanted to dessert (which I did, come on it was my birthday!). My mom did ask several times for a glass of water which she never brought over. She was more concerned with other tables around us with whom she could flirt with (apparently my husband and dad are unflirtable?), and we tip well as long as you pay attention and are a good server.   All in all it was a great place and next time I am back in Vegas I will definitely go back.",

It wasn't even worth $10. just a bunch of lettuce cheese and tomatoes stuffed into a taco shell. nothing special. Also the service was pretty bad, not that they were rude or anything they just neglected us. We had asked for two plates for the tacos and they didn't bring it to us until after we didn't need it because they didn't even check on this until way after food it come out. They didn't refill our waters until the end of our meal either which was annoying. I would skip it next time definitely not coming back.",

On the bright side, the award winning Bacon Mac n Cheese burger and quad fries were among the selected moonlight survivors. Las Vegas has become a Mecca for gourmet burgers and Guy's spot is a strong contributor. The only thing preventing me from giving this place the 5 stars it deserves is the cost. Gordon Ramsay's \"Burgr\" has to be considered a strong rival and my comparable burger there was $6 less, leaving enough left over to add their incredible Oreo creme brulee milk shake. That being said, you're in Vegas and I'd recommend hitting both Guy and Gordon's spot for a heated burger showdown. If you can only choose one, I would personally give Gordon the slight edge but it could go either way. Gordon's patties are smaller but thicker and Guy's are bigger but thiner. Depending on how you like your burger prepared this could drastically affect your experience. I mean, I personally wouldn't want a one inch thick \"well done\" burger or a quarter inch thick burger done \"medium rare.\"   Try it or Diet Final Word  Try it... and take. your. time. If you do it right the $19 you pay for your burger will save you $50+ in the casino.",

We were seated very quickly and the waitress got to us the moment we were seated. I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a soda. It did take a long time to get our drinks. I had to ask about my beer a second time. I did cut them some slack because of how busy they were and it appeared they were a bit short staffed.  The place has a simple decor. But it does not stand out as anything special. It is just pleasant, nothing more.  Guy has put out an eclectic menu here. It is only two pages, so not a huge selection, but it is a pleasant selection consisting of Salad's, Wings, Burgers, BBQ, Fries and desserts. I had a chili bowl. The taste was pretty good, but for the price I expected a little bit more. I think Guy's is a good place to give a try. I may or may not go back myself.",

We ordered the ribs $33 maybe 5oz of food ,corn bread sticks were flavorless. Shocking actually! Hoping for sweetness.   Meat had good flavor on the parts that weren't dry. Lizenda was very nice and did a great job.  Service is nice but I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.  Sorry Mr. FIERY",

Usually this place always has a long wait! In the past we have ordered the BBQ chicken wings, Mac and cheese burger and some other burger that's no longer on the menu. All was pretty good but nothing that we HAD to have again. This trip, I couldn't decide between the motley cru sandwich or the tatted up turkey burger. I asked our server, Nick, his opinion and immediately he stated the turkey burger was his favorite item on the whole menu! Well how can you say no to that? I ordered the turkey burger while the boyfriend ended up ordering the Motley cru last minute. I LOVED my turkey burger. It has some kind of sweet sauce that I can't recall on it but it definitely made the burger. the fries are always amazing. I love their seasonings. The motley cru looked good but the cheese could have been melted a little more. It had nice flavor but wasn't the best pulled pork sandwich I've have ever had. All in all, Nick provided great customer service and the food was delicious! I'm sure we will return next time we are in town!",

The burger came with fries but because the burger was so filling I hardly even touched them. My boyfriend had the General's Wings and the Sashimi Wonton Tacos. He really enjoyed both. The General's wings had a really yummy spicy/sweet flavor along with fresh jalapenos. We were all really satisfied with our meals and I can't wait to go back and try Guy's other offerings.",

I will say that the meat portion of the meal was good I ordered the ribs and they were tender and had some flavor, however the mac n cheese that came with the meal was horrible. My son ordered the brisket and also tasted good, but again the side dishes were the problem, his fries were burnt and the Texas Toast was anything but good it was like they stuck 2 pieces of bread in a toaster. I asked for salt and pepper since there was none on the table and I was told by the waiter they do not have salt and pepper on their tables because it would ruin the taste of the food. I think salt and pepper would have made the side dishes a little more tolerable.  2) The service was horrible. Our waiter would disappear and we sat there with no drinks through half of our meal. We finally received our drinks when we were done with our meal. It took him 25 minutes to bring me my check and another 15 to cash me out.   Needless to say we left there not satisfied at all. I think for the price I paid for the meal I should be raving about the meal.",

Avocado was actually well balanced. It felt heavy as I bit into the wrap and I realized why. I unwrapped it and based on my eye count the percentage of each ingredient went like this:  15% eggs 15% potatoes 70% wrap/bread  It was just so heavy and not tasty because the eggs and potatoes made up so little of the wrap. You only realize after unwrapping it of how truly imbalanced it is. I was disappointed even more because I expected more especially after reading the reviews. Def will skip this brunch next time I'm in town.",

The burger was twice as big as the bun with an extra slice of turkey inside.  The flavors were not bad, but the burger itself was not something I would ever order again. Have to say the manager gave us a discount and was very receptive to our complaints.",

First off we're waiting to be seated when at one point we notice people who came after are being seated. This was not exactly the hosts fault as someone else decided they were going to take our place in line. Once they finally get a table for us things start to go smoothly. We order everything at once, get our drinks and appy within a reasonable time. Things start to take a change from here. Our meal comes while we've barely had a chance to take a couple bites of the appy. After this our server is almost non existent so she couldn't ask us if we wanted more drinks or if our ribs (which were very tough and chewy) were to our liking.  Whatever right? We finish up and wait for her to come by. And wait. And wait. She walks by quite a few times avoiding my eye contact as best as possible and just walking on by when I fairly loudly say \"hi\" directed right at her. Giving up I go to the front to ask for the manager. He comes by and I explain the situation. What does he offer? A great big slap to the face saying that the chef has invited us back to dine with them. Thanks but Im only here for a vacation and wouldnt want to waste my money on mediocre food, terrible service and an even worse manager to back them.",

Seriously a work of art.  Because the Bloody Mary was so huge we chose to split Guy's version of biscuits and gravy!  WOW OH WOW was I ever glad we split it!  It was the BIGGEST biscuit I've ever seen.  Seriously the size of both of my fists!!!  It was covered with scrambled eggs, gravy, and chicken fried bacon.  The bacon was the best way I've ever eaten bacon before!  I'm seriously thinking we need to chicken fry everything!!!  Totally want to come back for lunch or dinner!",

They are crispy shoestrings, with good truffle flavor through the whole pile (some places just drizzle some oil on top). I also tried the fondue, which comes with pretzel sticks wrapped in pepperoni. Also delicious, but very decadent and on the salty side. So give it a try - you're in Las Vegas, have fun!",

We went here after being told there would be an hour and a half wait at the Hash House a Go Go. The wait was fine - only about ten minus on a Saturday morning. Was excited to hear about eh Bloody Mary's and ordered them with fixings. Well, why does it take almost 40 MINUTES to get a Bloody Mary????  We asked several times for water. My french toast was cook, the berry pancakes were amazing, the breakfast burrito was ok. But coffee refills were almost nonexistent and our waiter literally disappeared for about a half an hour. So, food was all right but terrible service. Other tables on the patio were complaining as well. What is the excuse for poor service???",

I love watching Guy Fieri on Triple D and so I had to come here for his own spot. I got the Kansas City Hot Wings and my boyfriend had the Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger. They were both amazing and I love the uniqueness on having a variety of fries. We hope to enjoy again when I go back to vegas!",

    "text": "My husband and I came here late on New Year's Eve, as we wanted something quick and were not hungry enough to warrant spending a ton of money on a fancy pre-fix holiday menu being offered at most other restaurants. If you watch Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, you will totally get the \"Guy Vibe\" from this establishment.   The menu consisted of a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and barbecue items and I found it to be somewhat limited. In fact, there was only one sandwich that stood out to me and I still had to alter it to my liking. However, that one sandwich was so good that I totally wouldn't mind ordering it again, and again, and again. It was the Turkey Picnic Sandwich - thick carved turkey breast, swiss cheese, cranberry relish, and mayo on a garlic buttered pretzel hoagie... I omitted the citrus slaw and bbq kettle chips from the sandwich. My husband ordered the Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger - applewood smoked bacon, six-cheese macaroni, and even more ooey gooey melted cheese on a garlic buttered brioche bun. Both the burger and sandwich were so big we could only finish half of each. They were served with a variety of seasoned fries including waffle, curly, shoe string, and crinkle cut. Those fries were pretty darn awesome too!  Though there was only the one menu item that sounded good to me, I'd definitely return for it and maybe leave some room for the yummy dessert offerings as well. I would love to come back when the weather is warmer to take advantage of the outdoor patio and enjoy my \"picnic\" of a sandwich.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of DDD and Guy Fieri, so I was excited to try the newest addition to the Quad Resort and Casino.   Food: The menu is pretty much your regular burgers, tacos, wings but definitely with a gourmet twist. We went with the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger. We originally had it cut in half to share, but it was crazy messy. The patty is pretty thin but super wide...way wider than the bun. The burger itself was really tasty, complete with the gooey mac and cheese and crispy bacon. I really liked the fries that was served with the burger. There were different types: curly, ridged, wedges, and I'm sure I found a regular fry in there as well. We also ordered the Triple-T fries which was just as it was described: Truffle+truffle+more truffle! Loved the truffle flavor and the shoestring style fries. We didn't get to really try anything else because we were so full, but I definitely want to try their cocktails and dessert next time.  Ambiance: Alan L. described it perfectly: Ed Hardy-themed. And an extra touch of rocker style. The indoor seating area seemed a little small, but I would recommend sitting outdoors. The outdoor seating area sits right next to the walkway between the Quad and Harrah's. You definitely get a good view of people walking right by. Hopefully they see your meal and suddenly get a craving for some good burgers.   Service: The staff was fantastic! Our servers were attentive and helpful. We did have to wait for our food but the restaurant was about a week old and they were pretty busy that day.   Tips: Try out this place if you're wanting an overall good dining experience on the strip. And definitely opt for outdoor seating!",

We decided to do the Breakfast Sausage, Bacon and Eggs $15. The whole time we waited for our meals (approx. 15 minutes), we watched plate after plate of what looked like scrumptious meals. The open area of the pass made me feel like the food prep, and service was held at a higher than normal level of a restaurant.   When we received our meals, we never saw our server again until bill time. The meals looked really good, but to our disappointment, was awful. The food was very bland and dry (as if it was sitting at the pass under the lamps for too long.) The bacon was very greasy, and the biscuit was terribly dry. Even the water had a weird taste.  The service was bad, the food was bad, and we would not recommend this restaurant with so many others in the vicinity.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are Food Network fans so we decided to check out one of Guy Fieri's restaurants. We went after a Vegas show so they only had a late night menu, hence the selections were a bit limited. We ordered the mac n cheese burger and the cheesecake challenge and split the two items.  The mac n cheese burger was delicious but very heavy - I definitely would not have been able to finish it all by myself! The cheesecake challenge - well, we did not succeed in finishing the challenge. :( It was essentially half a cheesecake, decorated with potato chips, pretzels, and chocolate sauce. The cheese part of the cheesecake was delicious, but the crust was on the dry side. Having the potato chips and pretzels there was interesting - not sure if those were necessarily the best toppings to complement the taste of the cheesecake. Overall, this was an interesting experience, having gone to Guy Fieri's restaurant and trying some of his culinary creations.",

I ordered the Vegas fries to start which was basically like eating buffalo wings except for they were a massive pile of thick curled potatos smothered in blue cheese, carrot, celery, and coated with buffalo sauce. It was amazing. I also got the 14 hour brisket which was sooo good and the Montley Que sandwich. All lived up to and beyond expectations. I only give 3 stars because the wait staff was very ameture like and unattentive and the tables and seating areas were left unbussed and dirty for extended periods of time and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. All in all it was a decent experience food wise but the service and restaurant cleanliness was under par. A little disappointed.",

I had the margarita with jalapenos, it was pretty good, my glass was broken..badly.. but he got me a new one.  Service was questionable in the beginning but he got better.  We loved the menu and the atmosphere. We were not going to get dessert until our server said the words \"S'mores Monticristo\" . Sold. One of the best things I have ever tasted.

The food came out really quickly, for 4 people we ordered 3 plates and we still had a half sandwich left, we ordered the brisket trash can nachos, original ringer burger, and the motley que sandwich. Which were all outstanding, nothing to complain about. The nachos were giant and can serve 2-3 people and be full. The ringer burger burger was good but nothing special and lastly the motley que had so much meat in it you could've made another sandwich, all the sandwiches and burgers came with a side of fries which was very generous. All together guys was outstanding for the price your paying your truly getting a bang for your buck.",

I was shocked to say the least!!!  I ended up ordering the original smash burger and it was disappointing.  Really sweet and the onion ring wasn't crunchy at all.  Kind of mushy.  Then the fries had a sweet seasoning on them as well which didn't taste that good.  They had flavor, but just too sweet.  I did like how there was a variety of different types of fries.  That was the only cool thing.  It also had sweet pickles on it which made the sweetness on overload.  I think dill would be a better choice.  Then my husband had the brisket nachos.  Nothing special whatsoever!  They were kind of a joke.  A 5 year old could make them.  Horrible, and didn't even have good flavor.  Margarita was fair at best...definitely not worth $12.50 for a house drink, and my husbands $11.00 house Chardonnay was fair as well.  We were also kind of disappointed in the menu.  It's not what is shown here on yelp!!!  Some items are, but not all!!  Prices are outrageous as well.  But go figure...I'm sure the rent is through the roof and your paying for guy's celebrity name.  Overall, we won't be back.  You can easily go elsewhere for a great burger & not spend $18 dollars for it.  This place is unfortunately very overrated.  Our food also took forever.  Bummer bummer.  Service was attentive though.  Guess it does have one thing going for it.  Took forever to get our food as well.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "Disappointing experience!!! The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because my food was good, however the other plates were not worth the price at all. Not only was this a flaw but our waiter had terrible customer service from the beginning.He chose not write our order down and forgot it completely. We also asked for ranch for our appetizers which never came even after asking 3 times along with lemons. We also asked for the lemons multiple times and where told after about the 4th time that there were none. Finally when our food arrived one of the burgers was missing toppings and had mayonnaise which if he had written down the order wouldn't have happened. Perhaps the worst part of my expirences was that instead of worrying about his  paying customers the waiter was helping someone on the outside that was picking food off of others plates and gave her a box to take the food with her. I feel he should have spent less time on the lady on the street and worried about The people who were actually in the restaurant.At the end I was still disappointed I didn't get my ranch. Not only was the waiter terrible but the manager seem to have asked every table but ours  manager about our experience. Overall worst food experience by far. I would only recommend it if you take it to go.   Still waiting for my ranch...",

While family was in town we tried this place and ordered a signature cocktail, three different sandwiches, one burger, one appetizer and one desert.  Overall the food was just ok. The fries were over seasoned, cold and stale.  The sandwiches had too much bread in relation to the other ingredients.  The cocktail (bloody mary bowl) was flashy, with lots of edibles skewered on top, but was $40.  The macaroni n cheese burger was the best thing we ordered and even it was only decent.  This was a decent burger with a scoop of mac n cheese on top, which added a nice creaminess to the sandwich.  The trash can nachos were also pretty tasty with bbq brisket chunks mixed in.  The desert (fried s'more sandwich) was decent, but also had too much brioche in relation to the filling inside.  While some of the flavor profiles are good, this is just another strip restaurant that is getting by on flash and name.  Also, the service we experienced was terrible and extremely slow.  We visited on a Tuesday afternoon when the place was not packed and the service still sucked.  Total cost for one cocktail, four lunches, on appetizer and one desert with tax was $230.",

It was a cool setting. I liked the decorations and the menus, however it was a bit cramped. The waiter was friendly and took our drink order, we like to order appetizers, but the selection was very limited so we just decided to order our dinners. We both ordered the Mac-n-cheese burger which also comes with fries. It took about 20-30 minutes for our food to come so it wasn't too long of a wait. I was super excited to try this burger, recommended by the hostess. I was not impressed. The burger was a good size but for being a Mac-n-cheese burger you could hardly taste any cheese. I was a little disappointed. It was cool they the burger came with a side of 4 different types of fries, however they were COATED with seasoning making them really hard to eat. All I tasted when I ate them was the chili pepper salt mix that was covering them. I love food network and Guy's show, but I was sadly disappointed with the quality of the food. I thought for $20 I would get a little better burger than it was. Most likely won't go back, which I'm sad about because I was so excited to try it.",

You could see the paper underneath the sandwiches soaked through with it.  Had an hour long wait to get inside. It was packed and loud but that added to the fun atmosphere. Waitress was great and very attentive.",

    "text": "We're Las Vegas locals and have eaten at many \"celebrity chef\" restaurants on the Strip. In my opinion, the bigger the TV \"star\", the worse the restaurant. In that sense, Guy Fieri's did not disappoint. We went about 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday and it wasn't too crowded. Unfortunately, half of the indoor seating was in direct blinding sunlight. As in you had to wear sunglasses during the dinner to not be blinded. And sadly, many patrons did wear them. Seriously? Not acceptable. Then our waitress (I don't think she ever told us her name, which is lucky for her so I can't call her out) disappeared and barely to our order and had to be asked several times to refill our waters. She never even came back to take our cocktail order after I told her I needed a few extra minutes to order. Oddly, she was extremely attentive to the table next to us. Even then, our glasses sat empty forever. The food was salty, over sized portions and over priced. $19 for a pulled pork sandwich. That's high even by the Strip prices. Did I mention it was SALTY? Thus the constant need for our water refills. Even though the Mexican Churros that the table next to us ordered for dessert \"looked\" delicious, we had had enough and opted out of spending any more time or money there.",

They were showing the basketball games which was also great but a group a college kids were getting unruly using obscene language and arguing with the group across from them.  The management did nothing to stop them and it was really annoying to the other diners some of which had children at their table.  The other issue that night was that the bartender was having a really bad night.  Of the 4 drinks that came to our table 3 had to go back due to mistakes.  The waiter was obviously very frustrated with the bartender and you could tell they had words.  The positive was that the food was excellent again.  The portions are huge but the quality did not suffer.  We each ordered a separate dish and all walked away extremely impressed.  I had to take off for the lack of crowd control and the poor bartender service but the food was great.  Will definitely go back.",

I did go there on a Saturday night so I expected it to be busy but I went there after a show so it was pretty late. When we got there the hostess told us it would be a 40 minute wait. 40 minutes okay so we decided to eat at the bar. There was nothing wrong with that we met some friendly people at the bar and the bartender/our server was great. However as we watched two empty tables the entire night we started to question the 40 minute wait quote. We did the cheesecake challenge and it was good but maybe because I make a phenomenal cheesecake I was pretty disappointed. I did note that many of the appetizer seem like comfort foods and I can't wait to go back.  The vibe of the restaurant was pretty good and I think if they can get their kinks worked out it'll be fine.",

Finally we are seated and we sat there for about 10 minutes before a waitress even came over and talked to us. We ordered two pops and the bbq wings, and the bacon mac and cheese burger. It took about 20 minutes before we got our food. My burger was very plain. It needed some salt or something added to it. It was just very bland. Even with bacon and mac and cheese the flavor was NOT there. Also the mac seemed very dry like it had been made hours before. Then I tried tearing some chicken off the wings with a fork and it was really hard to do. The meat was very dry and not fall off the bone at all. The bbq sauce was good but the chicken was not good. Also both our pop glasses were sticky. So sticky they left a stickiness on our hands. It was the same on the new cups we got on our refills. It disgusted me because it makes me think they are not cleaning their glasses correctly. And at $4 for one pop and $20 bucks for a bland burger I was terribly disappointed. To be completely honest, I have had better wings from pizza hut.",

We almost ordered seconds to accompany our Mac and cheese burgers but were pleased by the assorted fries that came with the meal. We split the 2 burgers in half and this was able to fill the four of us as well. The only thing that I was a little disappointed by was that my particular burger didn't seem to have the same hardy portion of mac and cheese as my friends did and it was hard for me to really taste the macaroni (it was still good though). Also, we were a little disappointed to be told they had run out of the pepperoni fondue dippers that we ordered (I also heard the table behind us ordered something behind us that they ran out of). I guess that's what happens when you try to order \"dinner\" at midnight.",

The service at the bar is friendly, fast, and super attentive; don't bother sitting in the main dining room - the servers don't seem as friendly and they don't move as fast.

    "text": "Sorry Guy, my experience wasn't the \"real deal.\"  It started off great. We were seated right away, in a corner table with a strip view. We browsed the breakfast menu, which is pretty limited. I understand keeping things simple but not everyone wants a huge plate of food. For instance, I like basic eggs & potatoes but don't care for breakfast meat. My only option was to choose the classic plate, which comes with bacon & sausage.   Yes, total rewards members get $1 off. My eggs & potatoes put me back $15. Fine, we ordered and waited. Then waited some more. Saw larger tables sat after us, on both sides of us get waited on and served their meals. We were still waiting. When our plates finally did arrive, nearly an hour later - I tried to eat the meats on the plate, as I paid for them but the bacon was cold & flabby. I couldn't even cut through the sausage & it had a very odd taste to it. My daughter tried a bite & spot it out. The potatoes were very good and I did enjoy the complimentary watermelon & mint gazpacho shot. Unfortunately, the sage biscuit was dry and my eggs were cold.   Although multiple servers looked at us and helped other tables around us, no one mentioned or apologized for the incredible delay in the delivery of our cold food. No compensation was given at all on the check.   The bright side is that they make a pretty good chocolate milk?   Guy, sorry but I v'wont be back.",

Also, it should be noted that these burgers are huge. Perfect for sharing.  I also tried the Generals wings. When they were brought to the table I was a little thrown off. The presentation make them look very spicy but they aren't. They taste just like the Chinese spare ribs typically found at buffets.  The service here was horrible. Our server clearly had too many tables to tend to. He was polite but in over his head. He basically took our order and delivered our checks. That was it. Our dishes weren't even cleared until after we left.   Great food not so great service.",

    "text": "Went in with high hopes during a trip to Vegas for the weekend, but unfortunately the combination of bad service and outrageously overspiced food wrecked the experience for us. We only had to wait about 30 minutes for a table on a Friday night, which wasn't too bad. However, the service at the table was extremely slow and our waiter was not attentive or apologetic for taking too long to bring our food and the check. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out between appetizer and entree, and then our waiter mysteriously disappeared for about 30 more minutes without any explanation at all.  The food was in some ways what we expected from Guy Fieri - big, loud, over the top and bold. The Vegas fries were a great appetizer with a delicious hot sauce, but our entrees (burgers and sandwiches) were far too large to be easily eaten, and the seasoning was overpowering. \"Light\" is definitely not a word I'd use to describe anything on the menu.   With so many other great celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas, it's hard to recommend this one.",

They do not have a kids menu, so they got sides of mac and cheese with fries. The fries were seasoned amazingly. We also got the trash can nachos and song Whiskey wings. They were both great! Portion sizes are Big! Great to share! We always got a \"go big\" drink. Panoe cattle is what the cocktail was called... AMAZING!!! Just thinking about it I want another one!  To top it all off the server asked if you could get a desert for the kiddies, which was so kind of him! All the staff was nice, helpful, and on their A game!  Okay, I know I said the desert was for the kids.. OMG! The best I've had anywhere! He gave them a mint chocolate ice cream pie! I'm guilty of sharing it with the kids, I couldn't resist! This is a great place to come!!!",

I got my birthday wish by eating and Jose Andres's restaurant so why not try out another popular chef celebrity. I do like his grocery games show. While she went searching for the bathroom I went ahead and ordered for the both of us. We had a show to catch. I noticed everybody was eating the trash can nachos which did look delicious but being half spanish I myself prefer the tapa style small bites. So I ordered us the tuna poke won-tacos and lobster lolipops. Both were so delicious and the perfect amount of food without feeling overstuffed! We did have some refreshments on the proof side which I do not remember. It's Vegas lol. We both did decide to order a burger to go which shamefully I do not remember the name of but was the perfect breakfast to wake up to! I recommend this place!",

We asked about happy hour and the host told us it was going on at the bar. We walked in and sat near the bar at a booth. About nine servers walked by us without acknowledging us or offering to help. Finally, I asked a server if we could see a couple of menus to hopefully get their attention. The gentleman asked if we sat ourselves in the booth to which we replied yes. He said we could not look at any menus and we would have to leave the booth to see the hostess to have them seat us before we could receive any service at this restaurant. Instead of feeling more embarrassment, we just left.",

This review may be a bit biased since I love VEGAS and Guy Fieri is my favorite celebrity chef. Guy's Vegas Kitchen and Bar did not disappoint! We got burgers (the Mayor and the Bacon Mac n Cheese) and were blown away by the freshness and fun flavor combos! Since anything can happen in Vegas, we got adventurous and tried the sashimi won-tacos, too. WOW. I don't usually like sushi because it's too spicy but these were AH-MAZE-ING. Definitely recommend!   Another thing I like about this place is the atmosphere feels like a fun party but you know they are serious about their food because the menu uses all these kitchen insider abbreviations (\"LTOP\" = \"Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, and Pickle,\" \"SMC\" = \"Super Melty Cheese\").   We try to go to Vegas a couple times a year but this was our first time to Guy's because we wanted to be sure we were ready to experience FLAVORTOWN! Will DEF be back!",

My boyfriend got the hot wings but couldn't finish them Because they were extremely hot (he didn't think they would be THAT hot lol) I got the Mac n cheese burger, it was HUGE and so good! Though I suggest you have it to share because I only finished half of it and was stuffed full after. My 5 stars in basically because the food was amazing and our waiter was pretty good too.",

    "text": "It is said that America is an idea. For this reason, I've long believed that Las Vegas is the quintessentially American city--unmoored from any specific reality, yet a phantasmagoric facsimile of many of them. Las Vegas embodies artifice, but it also suggests something else: that the imagined is more essential than the actual. You don't have to be in New York City in order to \"spend all your money\" or \"eat at Rao's\" within view of the \"New York skyline.\" You don't have to be a race car driver to drive a Ferrari around a track at warp speed. You don't have to convince an actual person to be in a relationship with you to... well, you get the picture.   Guy Fieri, auteur of the Vegas mileu (and creator of Vegas Fries(TM)) knows this instinctually. Little surprise then that the man is well-represented in this town, including by the savagely brilliant Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar.  A waiter rolls up to your table bearing a small trash can of nachos and some spicy margaritas. As you wonder how your grubby little fingers will reach the cheesy, barbecue-blasted goo at the root of this heapin' helpin' o' chips, voila! -- the bottomless can is snatched away, leaving a dare-I-say perfect cylinder of slightly-sweet yet tasty nacho.    Ever had a burger spackled with SMC (that's \"super melty cheese\" to the uninitiated)? If you've been to Flavortown you have. Is that burger \"the best in Las Vegas\" (as voted by SEVEN magazine, whatever that is)? DNDC (that's \"don't know / don't care): What I do know is that along with SMC, that burger has mac n' cheese, bacon, LTOP (I'm not spelling that out; keep up) and the inimitable Donkey Sauce(TM) all over it, and it goes down just fine before or after a (once again slightly sweet) Fireball Whiskey Wing. Oh, and for real, don't eff with that spicy margarita.   Chilaquiles? Now? It seems counterintuitive, really, but if you've been up till 8 a.m. blastin' your schnozz with 'caine and/or hip-thrustin' to the block rockin' beats of Tiesto, then 3 p.m. on a Thursday is Vegas Brunch O'Clock, my friend. And these chilaquiles, to be truthful, are the best looking plate I've seen from this joint yet.   You can dine outdoors at Guy's Vegas Kitchen, and you ought to -- the better to drink in the corporate colossuses stacked around you, punctuating that dry desert air soaked with the smell of money ill spent. Should this plate of nachos cost twenty bucks, a plate of ribs north of thirty? Nah. But by Vegas logic -- nay, by Flavortown logic -- it not only should, but it must. For if there is one idea that (T)rumps all others in America, and in the most American city, it is extraction. Capitalism is both engine of and raison d'etre for American freedom. Vegas takes that capitalism, stuffs it in a fake-bottomed trash can, slathers it with cheese sauce and barbecued meat, and charges you twenty bucks for the privilege of stuffing that bad boy in your mouth. Vegas takes capitalism to Flavortown.   And as Vegas is to America, so, then, is Flavortown to food. It is a place that connects us without connection, that unites our people behind a vague, occasionally multiethnic, promise of familiar abundance. It is any America: a Texas roadhouse, a Midwestern diner, a BBQ joint, a dive bar. It is, in an often lonely city that is somewhere yet nowhere, a home.",

One thing that's a plus, however- we received our food a lot faster than we did at Ramsey's place! Overall, not sure I would be back, and I would probably recommend going to one of the other burger joints (as long as its not In and out or McDonalds lol)",

Food was set up for endless tourist so it doesn't matter if you don't come back.   Went in with four of my friends, just out having some dinner. We got sat fairly quickly, but I suppose that's because it was around 4:30. (When we left there was a line out the door.) Our waiter came and told us about the menu since we hadn't been there. Then he left. No question about drinks or mention of water on this toasty 113 degree day. So we waited and looked at the menu. He came back to take our order and our drinks still hadn't come. Oh well that's because he's just the \"food guy\". Apparently there's another guy that brings our drinks.   My friends all ordered fairly seamlessly, mine was a little more complex. I ordered the Ringer with a gluten free bun. The waiter asked if it was an allergy thing or preference because there are other items on the burger with gluten in it. I told him it was preference and everything else on the burger was fine. I also ordered an appetizer. Around now our drinks show up.   Our food came out timely for a group of five. I noticed my burger was missing the onion ring, which is what makes it the ringer. The waiter says the kitchen got confused because of the GF bun. Ok, fine.   But wait! Where's my appetizer?  Oh it's coming. It was actually brought out very quickly. Almost like they had it ready and forgot it.   Overall, don't waste your time or money on overpriced and flavorless food.",

They even have the option to take your drinks to go, but if you order the GO BIG! as a carry out they give it to you in a quart sized container which fits way less than the 52oz.

We got our table and got drinks first. The soda was flat. McDonalds soda has more fizz than this place. No kids menu so I don't know where Yelp got the good for kids info. Expect to order an overpriced burger for your little one. I ordered the award winning mac cheese burger and my wife ordered the ahi tacos. The food arrived and it looked good. Unfortunately there was little seasoning to the food. The food was so bland and I was just offended at the price I had to pay for it. The fries were soggy like a precooked batch that was just scooped in the metal bins. The motto on the side of the restaurant says go big or go home.

The wait was long but thanks to a friend's Diamond status with Total Rewards we got seated right away. Unfortunately, there were not a lot of options so we sat outside.  I'm all for alfresco dining but this is far from a beautiful vista.  It's Vegas after all.  The music was loud and the band across the way could be heard.  This is not a bad thing but the deck truly has a rock 'n' roll vibe.    What we ate - Ahi tuna tacos - perfectly cubed and seasoned tuna cradled in a crispy wonton skin shaped like a taco shell.  - enjoyed by all Greek Salad with Humus - The salad was great.  Had to do some digging to find this Schmeer of hummus on the bottom of the plate. I hate to quote my father here but if I'm paying that much for a salad they should chop it.  If I wasn't sharing the salad with the table it probably wouldn't of been that big of a deal.  Pulled pork sandwich with fries - The sandwich was HUGE!!  Tender pork seasons just right with a bit of a kick -- my friends opted out of the pretzel roll but I think it would've been great.  I love that the side of fries is three different kinds fries.   I'll go back, part of me is really dying to try the nachos served in a garbage can.",

I wandered in & managed to score the last table in a corner, as others filled up the waiting area.  I looked @ food on the tables as I followed the Hostess, & the portions were huge.  The large restaurant was bustling & loud.    My Server was excellent, & when I asked about the Cajun Chicken \"Alfredo,\" ($29.50) he said it was very good, & enough for 2.  It was, except the cheese was nowhere near \"White Wine & Parmesan Alfredo Sauce\" as described.  It looked & tasted like nacho cheese or cheese whiz, which I don't care for.  & There was plenty of it.  I suppose they ran out of A sauce & substituted without bothering to ask me.  The other ingredients were good, except there was hardly any Cajun seasoning.    I would return & split a Burger with a friend ~ but @ $19.50 ~ I'm just not that fond of Burgers.",

It was honestly one of the worst burgers I've had in a restaurant. my friend ordered the brisket and we weren't too impressed with that either. I would never pay 33 dollars for that again. on the other hand, the waffle fries and string fries were good. but overall, it was so disappointing as I was extremely excited to eat at guy's restaurant",

Had the Greek salad which was so gross, I couldn't stomach it. When my sister tried it her reaction was the same. How can you mess up greek salad? My husband and sister ordered the fish tacos and they were so bland and boring that they both just kinda went, \"uh.\" We also tried the pepperoni wrapped pretzels that were super gross and the cheese sauce, while ok, was so salty when combined with the pretzels it was almost inedible. The fries appetizers were so tiny, thin cut, nasty and looked and tasted so cheap; and yet surprise, they were expensive!!! After spending $100 for lunch for 3 people (no liquor or desserts) we expected to really like at least one item but we were all very disappointed and didn't really care for any...and this is coming from the least picky eaters ever. Way better places out there! Try The Social House if you happen to like Japanese...it's way cheaper (don't let the fancy outside detour you) and all 6 of us were amazed at how good it was! Another one we tried in Vegas was Goodwich. Yes, it's a little scary on the outside and it's kind of a hot dog stand type set up that sells sandwiches but WOW, Amazing sandwiches!!! The 3 of us fell in love! Do yourself a favor and try anywhere else but here.",

    "text": "I like Guy, and enjoy his show - but that doesn't excuse this place!  We have been to several of his featured restaurants from his show and have generally enjoyed them. As it relates to his namesake restaurant In Las Vegas,  I honestly could not have been more disappointed. Our party of 6 arrived at 4:30 on 8/22/15 & were not seated until 6:00.  It was busy, but not THAT busy.  I understand some patrons overstay their welcome, but there were plenty of times that a setting for 6 could have been assembled. We ordered the Los Nachos for appetizer and they were good.  We also ordered the fondue dippers that were a total joke!  It was literally RollGold 'type' hard pretzel rods with pepperoni wrapped around them..........I'm no culinary expert, but this was amateur hour by any standard. Not sure of all the exact names of dishes, but our group ordered: 1 Shaved beef sandwich - pretty good, lacked deep flavor 4 burgers - greasy, no medium rare to be found - decent enough 1 pulled pork sandwich - very good  I can't give any of the hostess, wait, or bar staff a plus review.  ALL were rude, condescending, disrespectful, & seemed to purposefully delay our service even more as the irritating evening progressed.  By 8:30 we were MORE than ready to get out of there, but our waitress was no where to be found.   The manager was called over and he was very nice.   He ended up comping our appetizers, but that wasn't the point, and unfortunately there was nothing he could do to stop this review.  I will never recommend this place, nor return.   Guy should stick to being the know-it-all on his shows and leave the real restaurant biz up to the experts.",

When we finally were seated it took about 20 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us and take a drink order. She finally made her way over to us (after taking 3 other tables that sat after us order) we went ahead and gave her our drink order as well as our food order. Took about 30 more minutes to get our food, when we finally the fries were cold and looked as if it was something they scraped off the bottom of the fryer. Now the burger was bland and tasteless. Which to me is pretty amazing considering it was a pastrami burger, I mean pastrami, hot mustard, on a garlic bun where could you go wrong... well it seems it was here. Food was terrible, service was worse, if you want a good burger take the trip down to BurGR because this place just doesn't cut it.",

Chicken fried bacon plate gets a 3 out of 5. The gravy was good but the plate was just missing something.

I should have known our experience was going to be a bad one when the hostess told my friends and I there was going to be a 40 minute wait when I could clearly see empty tables throughout the place. As we're waiting, we notice groups of people coming in after us, yet they're getting seated no problem. One of my friends complains to the hostess and she says, \"Oh sorry, I thought you left.\" Seriously? We eventually get seated and place our orders with an overly excited server. The restaurant, though busy, isn't packed but for some reason, it takes a while for the food to get there. I guess the food was so-so, seeing as how some of my friends finished their food while others did not. We ask for the check and remembering how other reviewers posted to show a Total Rewards card for a discount, I handed my card to the server. The adjusted bill was a whopping $1.42 cheaper than it would have been had I not given him my card. Long story short, I really don't see why people love this place. I might come back if my friends put a gun to my head, but I think I'd rather have them pull the trigger...",

There isn't much of a waiting area and they only take your first name.  If you're not crowded near the hosts' stand you may not hear your name. Another couple tried to take my spot. Once seated,  the service was great. There were enough misting hoses to make sitting outside comfortable.  The food though- you'll either love it or hate it.  There is absolutely no way you can walk out of here feeling satisfied without devouring over a couple of day's worth of fat and cholesterol.  We tried the Fireball Whiskey wings and they were too sweet and dry but the highlight of our food. We had the Cajun and Motley Que, both were very over the top. It was a carnival of flavors that did not blend well. It's like they put the whole kitchen sink in each entree so there's no subtly of flavors. Just a mix and fat and wackiness. We could not enjoy the food. I enjoy curious flavors and trying new food, but this is smothered oil, gravies and sauces all in one topped with whatever can be fried. This will probably delight many but disgust others. If you're after heartattck type food, you'll love it. If on the other hand you're looking for a good burger, anything at Gordon Ramsays Burger tops this place.  I've been to many of the places in various cities that were featured in Diners Drive ins &Dives. I enjoyed each one of those over this place. Still, the service was good as were the drinks and I can see the appeal of the place, it just wasn't for me.",

The hostess was rude and did not look at us when speaking.  We waited 25 minutes to be seated and there were numerous staff and empty tables in this restaurant.  It was about 3 pm in the afternoon on a Monday.  We ordered waters and the bucket o nachos to share.  The barbecue sauce on the nachos was not complimentary to the dish.  It was a strange  flavor combination.   The food took a long time to arrive and the waters were not refilled.  I had to go get the pitcher of water to refill our glasses.  We had to ask for our server to be tracked down to get our bill.   It was overpriced also.  I'm glad we tried it, now we know and won't wonder...such a disappointment.",

Then you place your order with a waitress who couldn't care less that you drove all the way across the states to dine here to experience Guy's great food!  She simply was awful!  Rada was her name!   Waited another 45 for food.  My husband and daughter got the Mac & cheese burger both very happy, I got the pulled pork sandwich very good but it was all the way cold.  By the time you have waited soooooo long no way are you sending it back.  I think Guy himself should look at the way his restaurant is being run.  As an outsider i could have made many suggestions.  Guy hope you read these because I think you are awesome!",

It was just great all around. The Smore's dessert was almost more then we could fit down. It was also very good but very large and it's better to split it then handle it by yourself. The service was good and the food flew out. I really liked the style of the place. This was a all round nice experience and If your a fan of Guy this is a great place to grab a meal.",

Actually, I think I REALLY loved 'em--more than the Triple T's.  Check the menu to see what they are.   We ordered the ribs but the server came back and said they had run out of them :(  Maybe they don't stock them on Wednesdays?  Bummer. We had a caesar salad that came with a giant crouton underneath.  The salad was kind of small if you consider the giant crouton took up a lot of room on the plate and I think it was stale.  This was a bland caesar among caesars. Since we couldn't have ribs, the server suggested the brisket nachos.  The chips were definitely stale and the toppings were too sparse.  I liked the idea of them but was disappointed.  Most of the chips I ate had some chopped tomato and hardly any cheese.  Needs a lot more cheese and meat on top, for sure. Service was great.  The menu is small, which I like.  The fries are EXCELLENT. :)",

We just wanted to get a quick bite and ended up sharing a veggie burger because the prices were so steep. $20 for the burger and fries. Each drink was at least 10$ so we easily spent $100. There was a group of older men that kept trying to talk to us. We were having a decent  conversation and then it took a turn for the worse. Tried to hint to the bartenders that we were uncomfortable. For some reason Mike not only didnt pick up on these cues but he continued to be really rude. Ie: we had finished our burger but was still working on the fries. We were also taking \"bomb\" style drinks so I had my napkin in my hand on the bar counter. Mike asked me if i was still using it. I said yes and put it on my lap. Not even 10 min later he came by and was like \"can i get that napkin?!\" So i gave it back and ended up using my sleeve.  I just couldn't believe that. Its all good though because Frank talked to me for a good 10min even though I knew he was busy working. And when one of the creepy guys tried coming up to me I just ignored him and continued to talk to Frank. The guy got the hint and went back to his table. Wish I could come back and try the bloody marys or other dishes. My friend is a vegetarian so thats why I chose to split the black bean burger. It was just OK -dry- and the fries were severely oversalted. Just a hint to Mike, when you're on the strip, your customer service goes a long way. Why would I choose to come back here and spend $100s when I can spend the same amount and eat somewhere else where I will be treated with enough respect to use my damn napkin as long as I see fit. Learn some manners from Frank!",

The patio in 104 degree heat, there was a breeze coming from somewhere and the cold beer kept us pretty cool.   Our server Jonathan was really sweet and very attentive. At first I though oh no he looks mean but that was not the case I think he just has RBF, lol. He recommended Pizza Chronic ale and omg this is the best IPA I've tasted. Normally I don't like IPAs at all but this one was delish. I wish I had ordered that for myself instead of the angry orchard I normally get but I still stole a few sips from my boyfriend.   We for apps we ordered the chili bowl and fondue dippers. The fondue dippers were good. For an app they were really good. The chili bowl comes with corn bread on top but due to corn allergies we asked for it on the side. The chili was good, very meaty comes with a really hot sauce and sour cream with chives on the side. It was good but nothing special about it. The corn bread was bland. But the chili covered it up. Wish it was gritty like Jiffy brand. I ordered the frozen Fireball that I was told would be kinda slushy. The shot was like a normal chilled shot. That bummed  me out. Don't advertise frozen if it's not.   I asked how the mayor of flavor town was. Jonathan said its the best burger ever. This was an awesome burger. Cooked perfectly, full of flavor and juices without being pink.  It's a burger on a pretzel bun topped with Swiss cheese, slaw, and lean pastrami. Juices just running onto my hand mmmm.   The fries were a mixture of different fry styles.To me they tasted like Lays BBQ Potato chips. Good portion but still pricey $19. Boyfriend ordered the brisket which was good, full of flavor but not much brisket, it looked sooo big because of the the two giant inch thick Texas toast it sits on. Also served with fries. But for $32 there better be more meat!  They accept all total rewards coupons.",

    "text": "I see that this restaurant already lacks reviews showing 3.5 Stars...  I wanted to add a zero but Yelp doesn't allow it...  My friends and I are from SoCal. Another place filled with great restaurants and busy ones. We were a group of 5 on a Sunday afternoon. So yes it was very busy. We waited 1hr for a table, no problem we understand.   Finally after being seated outside, we had a server named Nick. White guy with blond hair and glasses. Make sure if you see this server ask to be moved immediately!!!   We ordered 2 appetizers, which came out way late, but again we understand because it was busy.   Each of us ordered a sandwich or burger of some kind. Everyone's order, not a single one of us got what we ordered. He then looked at us like we were crazy. Finally another 30+ minutes later we get what we ordered.   Food was very below average. Meat was dry, over cooked n way TOO SALTY!! This seems like a problem with many reviews leading to their very very poor cooks.   Time to pay... Of course another problem. I have hundreds of dollars in comps so I handed Nick, my players card to pay and also handed him a credit card in case I didn't have enough to put the balance on the card.  He comes back and says: \"oh the first time I ran ur players card I couldn't get the money so I charged your credit card, n then I figured out how to do it and I charged your players card and voided your credit card\".... REATARD!! Come to find out today, 4 days later, the charge went through on my card!!! Now I have to fight this with my bank.   ATTN: managers!!! This nick guy that works outside on the patio on Sunday 4/24 at around 1:30pm should be fired! I wouldn't have someone so stupid working there!!",

Our food managed to outdo my expectations of taste & quality, and the bartenders (the guys) are all really nice, friendly, and engaging while not intruding on couple's  date-night experience.    Our first visit was top notch.  Sitting at the bar, we ordered The Motley Que Sandwich (essentially a pulled pork item), and it was really amazing!!  It came with Quad Fries, which are equally amazing!!  I could eat those fries aaall daaayyy...  it's like a mixture of different shaped potato cuts, each seasoned differently / separately before being compiled together.  Such a great concept!   They have a yummy shot that's like drinking Cinnamon Toast Crunch, hah, it's Fireball Whiskey & Rumchata together, and it's worth trying.  They have a good beer selection as well.    Our second visit was okay, but had it been our first, we wouldn't have been rushing to return...    *the hostess that day had an attitude    *the bartender (female) kept ignoring me, haha (she would only address my husband, \"How's your food?\" while looking at him & shaking her overly exposed boobies... is that an areola?  Lol.  She never asked how my food was, and I had to have my husband order my beer bc she wouldn't acknowledge my nods or waves.  Whatever lady.    *the '68 Cajun Sandwich was good only bc I was hungry, but I would not order it again.  It was a small, open-faced sandwich on a hard bread, like a baguette maybe?  The menu stated it would be on a hoagie roll, which is a softer bread so I don't know what happened with that.  It was dripping with grease!!  Quad fries were amazing again though!!",

Not the best burger, and not the worst I've had. Their firey chicken wings has this acquired taste that I just can't land my taste buds on. It came with their homemade blue cheese that just tasted weird to me. Their chili cheese fries were probably the best thing on the late night menu that I've tried.   However, our server was super. He was very attentive, friendly, and polite. Great job there! I'll probably give this place another try during the day when they serve their full menu.",

    "text": "We have been long time fans of Diner's Drive-ins & Dives, so when we planned our recent trip to Las Vegas it was a must to visit a Guy Fieri restaurant.  We were very excited to see that there were a few options to choose from & couldn't wait to give one of them a try.  We wandered down the strip until we found the restaurant.  We hadn't really eaten all day so we were really anticipating our meal.  We got there & only waited about 5 minutes to be seated which was great!  But once we were seated the experience went down hill.  We got to the restaurant about 2:45pm, so during a slower time of the day.  The service was so slow, for a table of 4 we ended up at the restaurant for two hours.  We tried to get several servers attention to help us as we were in a corner where they did not really walk by, but no one looked our way or made eye contact.  The food was ok, nothing to write home about.  I had the Lobster Tacos, they were ok, had a definite bite to them.  My husband had the Mac & Cheese Burger & it was ok, the Mac & Cheese was not flavorful & really did nothing for the burger.  Our friends had the Steak Sandwich which he said was kind of blah & Rice Bowl where was good with shrimp but to hot to eat most of it.  We were disappointed to say the least & would probably not take the time to go back, except maybe to order a side of fries as they were delicious, they had a combination of sweet & salt of them that made them great!",

Th girl who answered the phone said that they don't take reservations, what? So I tell her what the website says and she says, oh yeah thats for parties of 14 or more, wait the website says 12 why are you saying 14? She then proceeds to tell me that she isn't real sure about it, but I have to call a different number and pay in advance and it's like $52.00 per person - huh?  So I call the number she gave me and speak to a women who tells me pretty much the same thing, that it is parties of 14 or more, I  tell her what the website says about 12, she says thats fine, but it is $52.00 per person for \"select menu\" and I will have to pick out a menu and pre pay for the whole meal.  $52.00 for burgers and attitude, no thanks!!! Obviously we will be going somewhere else for our dinner that night.  Personally, I think all Guy is trying to do is make major cash, it;s not about the food anymore, just making bank. Not much different than his restaurant at the Can Cun airport, $20.00 a person to go into the beer garden, if you want to have a smoke, since that is the only smoking area in the airport, I guess some people may pay it, but not me! It's not that I am cheap, its about principle, I will pay a lot for a great meal or experience, but I won't be raped, especially by a food network celeb, that will be washed up like Emeril soon,",

However if you like real good food with even better service this is the place for you to go! For an App our family of four had the nachos to share.  Really tasty.  The cheese and topping to chip ratio is better than any other restaurant I have been to.  The flavors are spot on.  Just enough spice to make it all really tasty. Mains were the street tacos (you got five small tacos with two dipping sauces), and the mac and cheese burger.  The street tacos were really good and almost overstuffed the small tortillas.  The burger was very good.  Too bad I didn't see the mac and cheese as a dish or side.  I would have ordered it.  Fries are also fantastic.  Just enough of a spice to make them a little different.  Warning the burger is messy.  You will get the napkin dirty.   Service was also really good, place has great food.  Hopefully he branches this concept out to more than Vegas.  I will be back!",

I especially loved that the fish tacos were made with a grilled fish rather than breaded and deep fried. If I would have been able to take food home, or had a fridge in my hotel, I probably would have gone back another time to try a burger, because those sounded and looked fantastic, but too large for me to finish and I didn't want to have to throw half of it out.   The only thing that I would have liked is some sort of small side with the tacos. The dish is just 4 street tacos with some toppings to add on. And although I was full with the 4 tacos, it would have been nice to have a few bites of something else, just for variety.",

    "text": "This is solid comfort food with little chefy nuances added that aren't necessary but will separate it from your other $15 burger joints.  The restaurant is pretty big and we showed up at around 5PM after work and we easily had our pick of inside or patio dining. We had two servers during our visit and both were genuinely nice and delivered great service. The food is good, not healthy, but also not going to really knock your socks off either. The portions are humongous! Plan on taking some home or sharing, girls. Guys, you should be satisfied. We ordered the turkey burger (friend loved it and if I come back, I will probably order that), the bacon mac & cheese burger, loaded chili fries, and buffalo lollipop wings. The cocktails were good and like the food, was made with fresh ingredients. I wish I had room for dessert because they looked pretty good.  By the end of our visit, it picked up a little more but this restaurant would probably do better in a different location.",

The pancake pot pie was really tart so if you're expecting sweet, make sure to ask for maple syrup. We had to ask for it. The dragon's breath chili Benedict could have use more spiciness. I like my order of fried chicken and gravy except the chicken was a tad overlooked hence it was dry. The food was served lukewarm. The service was good so they earn points on that.",

The Bacon burger mac & cheese was pretty good. It could have been a little more juicy. I had the mac & cheese on the side & that too was dry. Presentation & the service was very good. It goes to say that \"It doesn't mean it looks good, that it must be good to eat.\" Maybe because it was their late night menu. Who knows. Obviously, the food that we ordered had been just sitting there. That's really too bad :-(",

The prosciutto was really low quality and quite disappointing. My husband had General wings - a play on general tsos. He didn't like them at all. The lollipop shape was cool, but they were bland and over cooked; nothing exciting. We also had the fondue app which was decent, but it came out with the skin layer on the cheese, which made me wonder how long it was sitting out. The decor was blah and the place was really cold and loud. We won't be coming back but I guess it doesn't matter since this is a tourist trap.",

    "text": "Background/disclaimer: pretty big Guy Fieri fan, came with some other Yelpers (thanks to Michael U. for the invite and Norm K. as well) to try some breakfast items.  This is my 420th review, in case that has any special significance. I'm sure it does but I just can't think of it right now...  I was a little late to the occasion, but I still got to try a variety of items from the new breakfast menu. The maple bacon french toast was pretty good. I would have liked the brioche to have more of a crunch, but it was pretty fluffy. The candied bacon was a little more toward crunchy then chewy and if you like a sugar coating on your bacon, you're in for a treat. The brulee banana didn't really add that much contrasting texture or flavor for me, but maybe I've just been eating too much banana lately.  Shortbread pancake and berry \"pot pie\" didn't do it for me. Thought that the pancakes were too soft and fell apart a little bit too much (could be personal preference) and didn't have too much flavor. The berry compote and accompanying syrup are far from overly sweet and are actually a little sour, so at least you know they're not hiding the actual flavor of the berries.  Each of the dishes apparently came with a shot of a vegetable juice. Hopefully Michael or Norm have the full ingredient list down. I did like the juice, which didn't have any hints of foulness or additives. Nice of them to give you something healthy.  Since we stayed past breakfast (8-11am), we were able to split a dessert from the regular menu. It was the S'mores monte cristo. This was my favorite part of the meal, with the deep fry treatment crisping up the brioche from the french toast being and melting a bunch of marshmallow and chocolate (plus graham cracker butter, apparently). Chocolate and raspberry syrups upped the indulgence factor a ton, and I enjoyed every bite.  Ambiance: not too loud, classic American music like The Doors and The Beatles, apparently uses old tables and intentionally dinged menu covers (for the breakfast menu) to try to capture the been-around-a-while feel. Can't complain.   Service: good as far as I saw, as they relocated our party to a larger table, brought out plates and utensils as needed, and never were absent for too long. I think they really emphasize service and want to show that they're trying hard by having a manager walk around to ask if everything's fine and by letting you review the experience through an app on the iPod/iPhone placed inside the checkbook.  I was hovering around a 3.5 rating, but since I generally look at 4 star places as ones that I would prefer to eat at again, I can't give that rating to this restaurant. It's Strip-priced and, based only on what I ate, I've been to better breakfast places around town in that price range or a slightly lower range. I did find it cool to see the open kitchen and to snap a picture of Guy's white jacket from his UNLV culinary school days, so Fieri fanatics may enjoy this place solely for the Guy branding.",

Our server was super nice, happy and so quick with our drinks. I ordered the Original Ringer Burger (19.50) and my husband ordered the  Buffalo Wings (16.50). The burger was definitely the best burger I have ever eaten, and I ate the entire thing, including the fries, which were seasoned with a bit of a spicy seasoning. The burger was so juicy, full of flavor, and toppings were not used sparingly. Messy to eat, but my goodness....so delish. My husband loved the wings...said he's never had anything like them...and he's a wing nut!  :)  We went back again the next evening, and I tried the Steak sandwich, and my husband had the Mac and Cheese Burger (21.50). I wasn't as impressed with the steak sandwich, as I was with the burger I had the night before. My husband totally loved his burger!  We really enjoyed the service and the atmosphere and will eat here again when we come back to Vegas.",

We probably took 2/3 of the fries to go as well as it was such a large order. It was insane and delicious and such a nice surprise. Our server was super nice and attentive the entire visit.  This is a great place to go for anyone who is a fan of Guy Fieri or burgers or late night bites.

Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen is what you would expect of the industrial restaurant complex, big flashy theme, oversize portions, and no soul.  I sat at the bar which I will say is the best part of the restaurant. The bartender was friendly and knowledgable and they serve some very cold beers.   After asking for a recommendation I settled on The General's Wings which is suppose to be Guy's take on General Tso but it was nothing more than a molasses like sweet sauce that had no heat and lacked flavor. It also comes with three dipping sauces that were not sauces at all but more like toppings either way the dish fails in every way.  Do yourself a favor don't fall for the themes eat off The Strip.",

So naturally I was pretty excited to try out his Vegas joint.  We arrived during breakfast hours, so we were limited to the breakfast menu. I scanned the offerings and quickly settled on Guy's Big Bite Burrito (\"soft scrambled eggs, chorizo + breakfast potatoes, wrapped in a cheese quesadilla with pico de gallo, black beans, guacamole + crispy fried tortilla chips + salsa\").  It arrived to the table shortly after and was *enormous*. I was positive I wasn't going to be able to finish it, but as I am a pig finish it I did.  It's really good. The various components all work quite well together and there's a consistency to each bite that's actually pretty impressive. I suppose my one complaint would be the lack of a pronounced punch of flavor. Given Guy's onscreen persona, I admit I was expecting a much more robust trip to Flavortown.  The accompanying chips and salsa (and guac) were fine, but somewhat unnecessary.",

We love watching Guy on food network and thought how cool he has a restaurant here and we should check it out sometime. There always seem to have a long line and wait so we decided to come back and try again. The second night we were there the wait was about 30-45 minutes. We didn't wait too long and were seated right away. We were sat up against the walls were all 2-seater tables were, squished next to bigger tables that seat 4. We asked if we could sit at the empty table to our left to have more room and was told no that it's for parties of 4. Well right after that they sat a couple like us at that so called table for 4 only. *eye roll* It took our server awhile to show up and when she did she expected us to basically order our drinks, appetizer, food, and probably ask for our bill too all at once. What is the rush? It wasn't even that busy at 9pm Sunday night.  We placed our ordered and it took awhile to come out. We finished our drinks and then our food showed up at the same time our neighboring table did(who were seated way after we did). All they could say was \"sorry it took long\". Okay so trash can nachos seemed cooled, they dumped it out of a bucket. The ribs had about 3 big slabs and definitely shareable. Nachos tasted okay, meat was cooked nicely but it lacked flavor. Ribs were horrible!!!! Overpriced and not good at all. It looked like they just poured bottles of BBQ sauce over it and served to us cold. We mentioned it and again just a \"sorry\". Well we ended dinner quickly and ended up sick and having to go to the bathroom after that experience. We had to find something else to eat later on that night because we were still hungry. It was a waste of time and money. It didn't live up to Guy's standards but then again everyone whose \"out there and known for\" usually has a restaurant and is packed because they're known and not all will be great. Don't bother stopping in.",

    "text": "This was one of the WORST burgers that I have ever had in my life.  The only saving grace is that every person who worked there was nothing short of the perfect employee.  Everyone was so polite, friendly and professional that I couldn't bear to say anything, so I ate in silence.   The menu is pretty frenetic!  An offering will  catch your eye, like pulled pork, and they throw so much other crap on it, that it is not really a pulled pork sandwich.  The exact same thing goes for the burger offerings.  When you get right down to it, there isn't that much offered on the menu.  There were so many things offered with the burger that I asked for everything on the side, because there was no description of \"donkey sauce\".  What arrived was something that resembled a tiny hockey puck, with a charred crisp and absolutely zero juiciness left to the meat.   I was able to eat about a quarter of it before deciding that I would rather be hungry that continue.  They couldn't even get the fries right.  There was a mish mosh of different types-shoestring, steak and waffle, all cold from having sat out way too long.  I had such high hopes seeing this name on the brand,  so I'm not sure where this derailed off the planet, but it did.  Does he not care about this venture or did he just sell his name?  With all the other offerings like LVB or Strip Burger serving up amazing dishes, you should go there and talk about his amazing TV show.",

We were seated pretty quickly and the hostess was very friendly. Our waiter was very friendly too and at first was attentive, but after we ordered he disappeared for long periods of time. We had a burger, Caesar salad and dynamite shrimp. My mom said the burger was good and I snagged some fries and they were pretty good. However, the shrimp was dry, overcooked and bland. The dipping sauce for it made it edible but it was very disappointing. The salad was fresh but the dressing was bland - did not taste like Caesar dressing. I was disappointed with this meal and would recommend trying somewhere else if you have the chance!",

I give this 3 stars cause it's not gross, but being in Vegas you have soooo many dining choices, to get a 4 star from me you gotta be on the next level for food quality.

These nachos are my ABSOLUTE favorite item because of the layers of flavors and textures.   However, on our last visit we noticed the portion size and recipe had changed. Less meat, BBQ sauce and other ingredients with a lot less chips. I was crushed that the nachos I dream about weren't the same.  But I didn't want to give up, so I tried again two days later and we requested our favorite server Chris Anderson. We look forward to seeing Chris's friendly face on our visits. He remembers our preferences and always checks to make sure our order is on point.  Chris made sure our trashcan nachos were dome of the best. When he overheard me mention the BBQ sauce is amazing, he asked if we needed more. He even noticed we didn't have many jalapenos and offered to bring more.   Good food can be found all over Las Vegas, but customer service isn't always superb. We are always pleased with our servers but especially with Chris! If it wasn't for his attention to detail, we might have moved on to another restaurant.",

    "text": "This restraunt is all hype, im sure most of these comments are made up. First of all the place looks real nice, the service is great, I love triple d show and that alone made me want to come over and try it out.  But the food is just not worth the high prices, and people saying the portions are huge are straight up lying.  We ordered the wiskey wings, 9 bitesize tiny wings for $15, the menu claims they are super hot, but they are not even close to being hot. The taste was not that good and the blue cheese and ranch sauses are disgusting. I had better wings at applebees, and better ranch sauce at jack in the box.  Next we tried the Cesar salad, again not that good either and i have no idea what that wall of hard bread on the salad was, looked like a monster crouton but it was not eatable..  So finally I asked for the best burger so I got the mac and cheese burger...  People claim burger is huge but its really just a decent size and its pricey $19.. The burger was just ok thats it. If thats the best they had i wonder how the others taste. I couldnt even taste the macaroni on the burger.. Honestly i had better burgers at chillis.. Now the fries on the other had were great, they mix 4 different kind of fries together and are tastey..  All I gotta say this place might be for other people but it wasnt for us, it looked like they are trying to hard to make the plates look fancy and cute but the taste just isn't there.. And not worth the high prices..",

    "text": "I hate to say this, but I have eaten meals at Applebee's that were better than the two times I have been here.  We went yesterday and while I do enjoy the atmosphere, that is about it.  The first time we went a few months ago, we thought it was just okay too, but not bad enough to post a review, but also not good enough either.  The items we have tried thus far: Fireball whiskey wings - not spicy at all, but i did like the lollipop style presentation. Carne asada tacos - no flavor to the meat at all.  Salsa bland as well. BBQ burger -  WAY better and much cheaper at Bobby's Burger Palace. Big Dipper roast beef sandwich - NO FLAVOR AT ALL!  No horseradish taste and the au jus tasted like canned beef broth.  Also, horribly tough meat that tasted faintly like smoke and the bread hardened up immediately as if microwaved.  Both the above had an assortment of different fries tossed together that would have been good had they not tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.  Now mind you, nothing at all between the meats and the fries on both visits tasted like they had been hit with any seasoning at all. I am very surprised at the bland fast food quality for the prices they charge.  Guy always seems to be about flavor and nothing has it!!  I am a local and love his shows, which is why I gave him a second chance to begin with.  The restaurant seems to be about style only, not food and not service.  Now, add to the fact that we had a snarky wannabe comedian for a waiter, who only came back to see if we wanted another drink after my husband was already done! Will not be back!!",

Starving and walking away with money in our pockets we were ready for one last great meal before we returned to the daily grind, should have gone somewhere else.  Service was eh in the beginning, 14 empty tables and the hostess tried telling us that they had no seats available. A manager came up and yelled at the poor hostess in front of us.  After being seated, our waitress was extremely friendly and the only good thing about my experience here.  We both ordered the Sashimi Won-Tacos and Drunken Fish Tacos. They were dry and underwhelming, Guy is all about flavor and sauces and spices and his food was awful!  I would never eat here again and cant even watch Diners anymore, how can I trust someone who can't make a decent fish taco?",

    "text": "Went here twice! Long story short, food was amazeballs. Try it out if you're in Vegas!  Long story short made long: (First visit) - My boyfriend and I were walking from Wynn's to grab some burgers at Gordon Ramsay's when we stumbled on this place. It was hot (what an understatement) and so we didn't want to walk any further so we decided to try this place out. Best decision of the trip! We shared an Original Smash Burger which came with their Quad Fries. Pretty damn good. We were both happy with our midnight snack and happily walked back to our hotel in the blistering heat--content, to say the least. Oh! And I brought my brother back a doggy bag of their Parmageddon Wings (I didn't try it myself but my brother said it was alright and wished it had more parmesan on it).  (Second visit) We were determined to go back and try more of the menu before leaving Las Vegas so my boyfriend and I dragged my family along! The boyf and I got the Smashburger again (only this time, the waiter asked us how we wanted it cooked). \"Medium well please!\" My parents shared the Smashburger as well (well done). And my brother got a '67 Cajun Sandwich. We finished every bit of our entrees with the exception of the Quad Fries because we were too busy nomming on the Triple T Fries we ordered on the side.   Wait. I need to tell you all how these fries make me feel. \"Triple T Fries,\" I say to myself as I roll my eyes in pure foodgasm bliss followed by a mouthwatering longing to taste these beautiful things once again.  Okay. My party was fighting to get the most amount of these fries into our bellies. They were so good! Order them! Don't be like my boyf and I the first time and say, \"Ooh, these sound good. We'll try them next time so we have a reason to come back!\" NO, ORDER THEM THEN AND THERE.  We then ended the wonderful dining experience with a S'mores Monte Cristo for dessert. Boy, believe me when I tell you to never say, \"We'll try it next time!\" when it comes to food. \"Carpe diem\" should be rule number one in any foodie's rule book. Actually, if my high school Latin has actually stuck anything in my brain, it should be \"Carpe cena!\" SEIZE THE MEAL.   Anyway, dessert was a great way to end the meal even though we were full. The chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces were the best part.  Yes to this place. Yes to the food. Yes to Guy Fieri. Come through! Totally worth every penny :)",

Which kind of defeats the whole idea of ordering an appetizer.   Also we were missing a place setting and when we asked for another one the busboy / server argued that he had the correct number and that we should look under our menus.

I mean, I have yet to be disappointed by any of the restaurants featured on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives that I've visited.  Well, so much for his namesake restaurant. Prices are in line with similar Vegas restaurants. That said, for the amount of money you're dropping, and the fact that the place carries a food celebrity endorsement, you'd expect a lot better quality food.  Had the bacon mac & cheese burger, and it's a fantastic burger in theory. Execution, however, left a crap-ton to be desired. The burger was dry (not moist & juicy) and clearly flat-top fried and not grilled. Then they serve it to you on this narrow wooden plank, which certainly looked cool. But when it's a big, messy, burger, the serving plate was utterly useless. The fried goodies it came with were also served in an odd manner -- wrapped in wax paper and suspended from an aluminum-wire thing. Super messy -- all form, no function.  Portions were, no surprise, massive. But when you consider the food was mediocre, it was just a plate full of blah. Ignore the Guy Fieri hype. No need to bother with this place.",

    "text": "Wow. Guy needs to visit and crack the whip. Let me start with the staff. I get you have to put up with tourists, but guess what? We tip...and we review. Staff was lackluster. Smiles and a good attitude would be appreciated.  We had to get up and go to the servers station to get silver wear because there wasn't enough settings on the table and the waitress didn't seem to care.  The menus were missing pages. Some were missing drink menus, some were missing beer menus.  Now for the food. Mac and cheese bacon burger a huge hit. Shredded BBQ pork sandwich was so good the person in my group ate it all! Portions are no joke. One of us ordered the chopped Italian salad and said it had pickled crunchy veggies that were to die for. Hubby and I shared poutine with flat iron steak on top. Have you ever had poutine? Do you know it is supposed to have gravy? Ours was served luke warm (probably because we were in a party of 9 and they brought out food all at once) and it may as well have been dry. Cheese curds were real but there weren't enough on there in my opinion. Steak was good.  This was our number one place to eat and I for one, won't come back. Our waters never got refilled. We had to ask about what other people were drinking ( there is a fish bowl type vessel you can get to save money if you are gonna order multiple drinks.) Suggestions about the menu was never offered. In fact I did my research before I went. I know they have a build your bloody Mary brunch bar. This should be mentioned by every server if for no other reason than to get people to order a bloody mary or to start the ball rolling on talking about your specialty drink selection instead of just saying, \"any drinks?\" It is my belief that our waitress figured out her tip was already in the bag due to our party of 9 so no effort was put out. We had to keep asking her to repeat what she was saying because she never bothered to raise her voice. We are a fun group that left totally deflated. Honey, you are young, pretty and working for tips. You might want to smile and try to engage your guests.  Two stars are for the food that everyone else got. Guy, you need to kick some flavor town butt. Just sayin'.",

It was so beautiful and full of garnishes that I immediately had to have one...even though we had eaten shortly before. There was sausage, bacon, a French fry, a full harvest of pickled vegetables, and some lettuce to fluff it all up. The actual Bloody wasn't as good as Hash House, spicy and peppery but runnier and less tomato flavor than I  preferred. Of course, I still happily drank it as I dipped my garnishes in the deep red liquid.   The REAL star of our drinks and apps visit was the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. I know. The name alone is cringe worthy, but these damn dippers were like a pizza crust pretzel love child who was then swaddled in pepperoni. Briefly crispy then satisfyingly doughy. They were served with this Sausage CRACK dip and cheese dip and I literally could not get enough.   Sure it was cliche but that blond guy who wears upside down sunglasses on his neck knows how to suck the hungover millennials and middle aged Food Network loyalists from the Linq in with his pretty drinks and his obnoxiously named appetizers!   I would gladly suggest to a fellow tourist that is looking for bar food but wants something uniquely Vegas.",

Another thing is that the food took forever to come. when it came the server handing us the food was talking so low we couldn't hear him calling out the food and he walked away with one of our meals. I had to talk to the manager because the customer service was horrible. When I spoke to the manager about the service he was very understanding and gave us a discount and a meal for free.

    "text": "Like many, I came here for the burger. Good experience overall. I'd say their burgers are worth trying.   This was a solo trip, so I ate at the bar. This was on a Wednesday afternoon in May, so there was no wait. There were others eating/drinking at the bar, and I had several seats to choose from. They have a good ratio of TVs going, if that's your thing. And pop music playing, not too loudly. The outdoor seating is shaded and looked fine.   Burger: the menu had 5 options. Honestly they all sounded good. I was tempted to get the Mac n cheese burger since that's the award winner and most popular, but I went with the turkey burger.  Wait time on the burger was reasonable, probably about 15 minutes. I learned from the bartender that they make all their patties from scratch, including the veggie burger (which she recommended and to add cheese to it if you get it), so the wait time makes sense. The bartender said her favorite is the pastrami burger, which she said was massive.   The turkey burger tasted great overall. It's a large burger and very filling. The char on the edge of the burger was really tasty and the patty was savory, tender, and flavorful. The poblano peppers, red onions, and bacon combined together nicely. Not all bites were the same, and in a way that made the eating its own adventure. That said, the edges where the char was and the middle were the best parts, and the others decent but not as good. I've had a lot of turkey burgers at restaurants: this one was unique and probably the best one so far.    Constructive criticism: I was disappointed with the pretzel bun - the top was too small and the bun was dry and kind of hard. Also, I thought the burger didn't have enough onion jam and donkey sauce. Where I tasted the jam I liked it. I asked the bartender for more donkey sauce, and to try the bourbon bbq sauce for kicks (since I didn't order the original ringer burger). The bourbon sauce was just ok (too bourbon forward and sweet for my taste), but I liked the donkey sauce. Adding those  made the burger better. The sauces go well with the fries too.   Service was good. Friendly, attentive (timely, repeated water refills!), and receptive to questions / giving recommendations / requests.   So, if you like burgers and don't mind spending about $20 for one, come here and see for yourself!",

We spent about 3 minutes walking around the outside looking for the entrance when we finally discovered the entrance was inside the casino.  After being seated outside, we were greeted with our waiter who looked like a bond villain, but was dressed like a cowboy. I asked him what's good around these parts and he goes off and lists dishes that sound like they were named by a 12 year old obese child.  My girl saw $20 unlimited mimosas and jumped at the chance. I quickly followed as soon as I saw Maple Bacon French toast. She been feeling guilty this whole trip so she got the veggie wraps. Which I feel like Guy was pressured to put into the menu at gunpoint.  This shit was amazing. I heard an old woman snap her neck on the walkway as she spotted the French toast.  It was beautiful, cascading ropes of maple syrup will drizzled over gracefully.  Whatever they put in the bacon is amazing, some sweet spice that adds a whole new dimension. I felt like eating that bacon made me grow a third ball.  Some homeless guy walked by and cleared the whole dining area, smelled like a wet dog, but other than that the experience was pricey, but quite a wondrous experience.",

Had the chicken lettuce appetizer that came with spring rolls and chicken skewers and it was awesome. Also tried the steak sandwich that came with a variety of different fries which was different and enjoyable. The steak sandwich was big but I could go with or with out it. Service was quick. They have a indoor or outdoor seating option. I enjoyed it here and would reccomend checking it out. Next time I'm trying their Bloody Mary, they look like a meal on a drink!",

It did not take long for our waiter to come and take our order. I started with a cup of coffee and my boyfriend had a Glass of orange juice. They were pretty good about filling up my coffee when I had some but the flavor itself was not the best. I'm just glad they had coffee there.  I ordered the two eggs, two Apple chicken sausages, two bacon strips, potatoes and a delicious biscuit with Sage. The meal itself was scrumptious. The serving was pretty generous so I didn't quite finish it and had to take some to go. My two favorite parts of my entree worth the biscuits with a hint of sage and the Apple chicken sausages.  I would definitely go back.",

Everything is packed with flavor and in a large portion. I got the steak sandwich, which was really good, and at the table the pulled pork sandwich and Hawaiian Hulu sandwich were also bought. All the food was cooked well, and even though a lot was going on, the flavors melded together very well for a cohesive sandwich. The fries that came on the side were really cool because it was a mix of different types (crinkle-cut, waffle, potato wedges, etc.) which was fun. The chocolate cake was so decadent, and you really could taste the Whiskey in it. The food was also pretty reasonably priced for Vegas. Overall, it was a good experience, and I would certainly like to go back again!",

    "text": "So - let me first say that eating in Las Vegas is CRaZY!  There are so many great places to get just about everything which makes it really difficult to eat at what are usually overpriced celebrity owned restaurants. BUT- we're big Guy fans, heard the burgers great, we LOVE burgers so we decided to check it out.   Yaaas Guy! That was a good ass Mac n cheese burger and the fries were yummy too. The only downside was that the Mac n cheese didn't taste like much and didn't add anything to the burger. I didn't know my husband ordered it and when I was eating my half something fell off (a noodle) and I was like, \"what is that?\", not even noticing as I was eating that there was Mac n cheese in the actual burger. They need to work on making sure the Mac n cheese tastes good alone before adding it to the burger. I wouldn't order that particular burger again but I'd DEFINITELY order a regular cheeseburger because it was juicy, flavorful, the bun was soft and it was filling. GREAT JOB!  We also ordered Trash Can Nachos. If I could preface my next statement with a confused Bitmoji face I would. What the hell?...The cheese sauce (really cheese goop) was thick, grainy, not an appealing color and made it difficult for the nachos to release from the tin can. She literally shook the shizzle out of it to get it to plop onto our plate. it looked NOTHING like the pictures or videos that had made our mouths water as we debated about where to eat last night. She looked confident in the dish so we thought OKaaaaay, it's Guy's so it's gonna at least taste good. Yeah-NO!  It was not a winner. Maybe they were having an off night in the cheese sauce department but that has to be fixed immediately. Also, if you don't serve that dish quickly it won't be hot (which it was not) and even worse the steam just kills the crunch on those chips which sucks. Would I try it again? Nope.  Customer service was great and we were seated pretty quickly. It was clean and spacious and my husband appreciated the placement of all the TVs.   Prices were super reasonable for what we ordered which we appreciated since many of the celeb spots give you less for waaaaay more.  It's worth experiencing and we'd go back again.",

Chipotle pasta- this was one of the things on the menu that were the same as the place I had worked just with a different name and I loved this pasta at Johnny garlics so I wanted to get it here. I remember it being better. It was still good but not as good as I expected based of how good it was at Johnny garlics. If you like chipotle and creaminess then you probably won't be disappointed.   The Vegas fries- these were ok. I didn't care for the wasabi blue cheese and wish there was more blue cheese crumbles. But they were still good.   Over all I think Johnny garlics and tex wasabi in my home town are better when it comes to the food but it's still great recipes.",

We were told it'd be a 40 minute wait for lunch and that they would text us when they were ready to seat us; the time given was accurate which was appreciated. We opted for a patio table.  Our server was excellent. He really took care of us and kept our drinks filled and was quick to bring us requested condiments. Impressive amidst the chaotic feeling of this place.  Our party of four started with \"original\" margaritas which were well made. You could feel them after just one. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (The Motley Que) and chose a salad instead of fries. A big ol' pickle was also on the plate.  The salad was \"whatever\" but the sandwich was tasty. The pork was plentiful and tender with a delicious porky flavor although not at all smokey. Fieri's bourbon-brown sugar BBQ sauce was \"okay\" but much too runny. This is definitely the messiest sandwich on the Strip. The slaw, onion straws and cheddar cheese rounded out the flavors between the pretzel bun which tried valiantly but ultimately lost the battle to hold everything together.  I enjoyed my lunch here although it's Vegas-overpriced. 3.5 stars.",

The restaurant was crowded, but there was zero wait time as we got seated right away. Our server was probably the best server we had our entire Vegas trip. He was soo entertaining and friendly with us, almost like we had known him for a long time.   I ordered the Kobe burger, and it was excellent. The other burgers all were bigger than the Kobe burger, so I would probably try one of those the next time I eat here. The burgers are very juicy with tons of flavor. The burger sauce that they use is also excellent. Sauce is very important for burgers, so theirs was spot on. The fries were perfectly crisp and not too greasy....very good meal indeed.   Don't hesitate to stop by this place in spite of it looking like it is jam packed with a long wait time. The restaurant is very large with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, so you won't have to wait long.",

I was surprised that the donkey sauce wasn't more flavorful. I think I just need a little more hot sauce. I may see if I could opt out of the pretzel bun because they just don't hold together well but I always like to order the food as the restaurant intended before I make my personal edits. Of course I enjoyed the Vegas fries like everyone else. Overall, it was tasty and I enjoyed my food. Next year I'm coming back for a lunch.",

The tuna tacos tasted and smelled so fishy despite being drenched in sauce, much like the Hawaiian sandwich.  The lettuce wraps were a bit salty as well.  Overall, a big disappointment.",

We just touched down, checked in our Hotel the Palazzo and we are off for an adventure. lol We walked until we heard loud music, laughing and smelled fried goodness. ( You know the smell).  The restaurant is really nice and it has a great atmosphere. There is outside patio sitting and a really nice area inside. There is Guy Fieri memorabilia everywhere and you can also purchase his sauces and other Guy Fieri items. They were supper busy but the wait time was less than 15 minutes and they use a text app to text you when your table is ready.  Our Server was Veronica was very pretty, great tattoos and makeup (I pay attention to those things). She was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us great recommendations. I ordered a lemon drop and my Husband ordered his normal... Blue Moon with an orange slice. lol We decided to order different items and share them.  We ordered the Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger and Double Barrel BBQ Wings, both were outstanding! I've eaten on Guys on several Carnival Cruise ships but they were nothing compared to this. If your are in the Vegas area stop at the Linq Casino & Resort at Guy Fieri, you will not be disappointed.",

Twice for breakfast and twice for lunch.  The French Toast with candied bacon was one of the best breakfast's I have eaten in a very long time. For my breakfast the following day I changed it up and tried the breakfast burrito, while it was very good it did not compare to the french toast I had a day earlier. The bloody Mary's are great too, perfect blend of sweet and spice, first the sweet hits you and then the spice kicks in. You can get bacon in your Bloody Mary, need I say more?   For lunch I went with Guy's signature bacon mac-n chees burger, it was amazing. The following day we were craving a mid day snack so we headed back and rather than try one of the other tempting items on the menu I went with old faithful and ordered the burger again. Prices may be little steep for some people for a burger joint but it's Vegas so I expect to pay the higher prices and I do not have a problem with it when the food and service is this good. if you are in Vegas you have to give this place a try.",

Since I dealt with management last night and today I am reviewing.   Expensive bar food! Bacon Mac and cheese burger dry had to dip in ketchup and thin burned edges of burger. Bun was soggy on bottom and too was hard on top. Service from Michelle was one of the worst I had in Vegas. Ask for a manager and a to go box waited over 30 min while she was signing and entertaining table of 10 guys verse keeping it professional and moving on to take care of all her tables or ask for help from someone. Bill was messed up and she didn't charge the other party we were will so put their 105.00 on my bill with a 44.92 tip for herself. Dealing with management had to call 2 times this morning. First time hung up on 2nd time waiting over 7 min and was told I will get back to you. Watch your bank and dont expect great food.   On a positive note my only recommendation would be the fireball whiskey wings as they were prepared nicely and presentation was good.",

    "text": "Pretty good .... I ordered takeout, which took a long time because I think the bartender forgot to put in my order. You can watch what's going on in the wide open kitchen. Staff was standing around, getting ready for the next rush. No takeout was being packed until I asked a few times where my food was. I've had the Caesar at Guy's place in Bakersfield, which was much better. This was a bit on the soggy side with too much dressing. Needed some fresh, cracked pepper. I got the Sammy recommended by the bartender as his fave dish on the menu, the Motley Que. I really liked this pulled pork delight on a pretzel bun with coleslaw. Maybe a teensy sweet/spicy BBQ sauce would amp it up? I pulled the unmelted, greasy cheese off. Yuck. Ooh, not interested! Still, sandwich is really good. The assorted fries were on the hard side, and the seasoning is a little much. It came with a whole dill pickle. Mine seemed to already have a bite out of it. Hmmmm ...? One last note ... Most of the takeout packaging was nice. I think they buy the cheapest cutlery kit you can buy..... White, medium weight polypropylene. Thin, one ply napkin included. This is about the cheapest you can buy. They spend a lot on the nice bag, a little on the takeout boxes and portion cups, and skimp big time on the cutlery kit. Net net = pretty good. Liked my last meals at Burro Boracho Rio (Laughlin and Vegas) and Bakersfield better.",

I would of like to have been told that it's not so much an appetizer but a meal. I would have not ordered a burger as well. I got the breakfast burger. It was a little underwhelming. Where the burger presentation is spectacular the taste wasn't entirely there. There seems to be a lot in the burger that the flavors get lost. The scrambled egg made the burger feel foamy and bland. The deep fried bacon, although it added texture, did not really push the bacon flavor. My friend got the pork sandwich which was also underwhelming. I expected a lot more from this place but it felt like an explosion of ingredients and over the top plating, versus the focus of developing flavors and delivering you an insane meal. I will say, the Bloody Mary is pretty damn good. However, it feels like they are not consistent in the toppings that are added. Some bloody Mary's around the room seemed to have more on them than the one delivered to our table. The sangria was smooth and delicious. I would recommend the nachos and a drink. I wouldn't come back.",

Of course it was probably the time of day but if I can visibly see tables are open and am told there is a 20 to an hour wait that is a problem. In such a high traffic area this should be well staffed. Otherwise great food and beers. Thanks for the experience Guy Fieri.",

I would like to thank my fellow Yelper's for their recommendations and would like to echo everything that has been recommended!! First off, portions are huge, so the 4 of us split 2 giant burgers and trashcan nachos. The trashcan nachos were spectacular! Made with brisket (being from Memphis we loved that), and fresh (not pickled!!!) jalapenos. We chose the bacon Mac n cheese burger, and that was the consensus favorite by the 4 of us. The other burger we chose was the turkey burger, which is unique in the fact that it is made with a slice of turkey rather than a patty. The side of fries is a fry lover's dream-it comes with a mix of every different kind of fry and seasoned perfectly. We also order a 'lemon drop...not!' and red sangria, although both were great the 'lemon drop...not' was the favorite. We had to wait about 10minutes for a table but service was great and food came out in a timely manner. Great place to stop in for lunch to fuel up before finishing your day on the strip!",

We had a fairly large group of 11 people so we put our name in, only 30 minutes later I got a text telling us to gather for seating. We were sat outside at a nice table with plenty of room.  Our waitress was excellent from beginning to end, getting all our orders right and the food all arrived at the same time so no one was sitting there without food. She even brought me a complimentary tequila shot as it was obvious from our matching T-shirts that we were in Vegas for my 50th birthday.  The food was awesome and the portions were monstrous! I couldn't finish my burger, it was just so huge.  Highly recommend this place; it was fantastic from start to finish. I will definitely go back the next time we're in Las Vegas.  Oh, and they make a wicked Old Fashioned.",

    "text": "I wanted to update my review because the manager messaged me on Yelp inviting me back to the restaurant. I appreciate the fact that they are concerned with their customers feedback. Hopefully they will use the customer feedback and implement the necessary changes that should be made. They could start with either lowering their menu prices or purchasing higher quality product. I don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, but that is not what is offered here. I am not looking for a free meal. I just give honest feedback to inform other consumers. So, I want to be clear about why I gave them two stars on my review.  I would give them five stars if the review was just based on their staff. The service was excellent. The staff is very friendly and attentive to the customers, as demonstrated by the manager showing concern about my review. The kitchen staff did a fine job on the preparation and the presentation of the food. I was disappointed with the quality of the product used in the perpetration. The prime rib in the sandwich and the meat in the burgers were not up to par. The chicken wings were average at best and extremely over priced for what you are served. Personally, I don't care for some of the flavor combinations on the menu.  I want to be very clear about the fact that the kitchen staff cooked the food properly and presented it as they were supposed to. It was the quality of the product I gave two stats to, not the service or the preparation.  I think my expectations of the food before I arrived led me to be so disappointed with the food. It is just average food though. It was not a bad meal and none of the food tasted bad. If the prices were not so high, I may have given them three stats. It is just not worth the money. The burgers are definitely not up to par with the likes of LBS, Bacchi Burger, and Gordon Ramsay Burger. I would even say Smash Burger and Fat Burger serves better tasting burgers.  To be fair, I will conclude by suggesting that you give them a try and make your own decision on the quality and taste of the menu items.",

    "text": "\"Expensive, but, it IS on the Strip\"  One of the first questions I asked our server was, \"Why are the prices SO high?\" She said right off because they're on the strip - although you need to walk around the place into the Quad to find the entrance. As for prices, for their selections, especially the burgers, I have seen lower prices at various hotels along the Strip in Las Vegas.  The burgers: With so many options for burgers along the Strip, I have become very picky about the taste of the MEAT in the burger, rather than just all the fancy toppings that places have been putting on their burgers to entice one to order. Three of us ordered three different burgers, and surprisingly, the meat on all three tasted different, and not from the toppings. We actually talked extensively about the different tastes of the meat alone, not the burger as a whole. So, while the burgers are overpriced, they were good. Many of my Las Vegas meat experiences have been that the meat is okay, just no special flavors in the meat itself. The burgers taste came mostly from the toppings.  The fries were fries, although their standard fries that come with the burger are a mix of three - waffle, curly, and regular.  Drinks - both non-alcoholic as well as the alcoholic - are very pricey.  Service was good.  Overall it was a \"standard\" Las Vegas establishment: pricey and themed. Although, I must say we were impressed with the quality and taste of the burger meat. (Which is why they got star #4.) However, I probably won't go back without a BOGO.",

The Bacon Mac & Cheese burger was every bit as good as it sounds & the BBQ fries are unique & highly recommended. Without a doubt the bartender, Jay, was the best part of our visit. He was funny, friendly & mixed up some cocktails that my wife absolutely loved.  Thanks Jay!",

I ordered a Pepsi since the only cold non alcoholic drinks were raspberry Iced tea( Isn't that a little played out by now?) sodas and Unsweetend tea!I  no Shakes nor Smoothies..a burger Joint without Shakes!1?? sigh! I could see as the server brought me the Pepsi it was flat..i swished around the drink & still no fizz..i pointed it out to her, she apologized & gave me water.. Hubby really enjoyed his Mac n cheese Burger it was big enough to save half for later. I had a pulled pork sandwich on a pretzel bun. It was tasty.   The food was a little pricey but food was tasty...I just wanted over the top goodness from Guy! oh and either a milkshake or Fizzy Soda!",

Staff is slow and hostess said there was a 25 minute wait for seating in the bar when there were numerous tables open,  but that we could sit on outside ring (bar height seating) facing Harrahs.  So we do.but then move to another table (that's clearly open and a better spot) and the waitress let's us sit there but says the hostess didn't let us at sit at table because she is \"controlling the flow\".  What?  First I think it might be because of our age but then see several other come, some go, and sit in that area when there are still open tables.  Completely ridiculous.  And the reason I've had so.kuch time to write all of this is because we are STILL waiting for our check!",

It was huge! But not too sweet and they even put shortbread cookies inside which added a nice crunch. My husband had the big bite burrito and it was huge and very tasty. The customer service was a bit lacking this first visit, and by saying that I am being kind. Our waitress first forgot we were her table and we waited almost 20 minutes to order a drink. When I mentioned that we had been waiting a while she became pretty rude and continually slammed down drinks and plates every time she delivered them to the table. From this you might be shocked that we went back, but we had been drinking and it was near by. This time we had lunch and our waiter was AMAZING! His name was Adrian and he was attentive and organized and funny. There was four of us and we had been drinking and he was totally into our mild shenanigans and had a great sense of humor. The food was good this time too. I had truffle fries as they make a great drunk food and a salad because I felt guilty that I only really wanted fries. I would defiantly go back but would probably leave if I go the first waitress again.",

The fries were also a medley of different fries. A bit salty but delicious. Another must try place. I'd come back.",

Our favorite item was the Ace Perry Cider my husband ordered. I was wishing I had ordered one too it was so yummy. It was moderately priced for Vegas- you definitely get you money's worth. Oh, and the variety of fries that come with your meal were awesome too.  Just the right spice!",

It came with 3 different sauces, 3 small spring rolls that were very tasty and the lettuce and the chicken for the wraps were very very good.  I wish I could say the same thing for the onion rings . The presentation looks really cool the way they serve them but I did not care for the taste. I don't think they were cooked all the way . The wait staff was super friendly and they kept our drinks full. I would definitely go back here again and try something new. I noticed they give large portions so I would probably split my meal.

    "text": "We had the pleasure of eating here twice in the same day.  Guy is the bomb, so we figured his joint would be, as well.   The restaraunt is very nice and the open kitchen rocks.  The wait staff was fun and attentative.    All of the decor, uniforms, menu and experience  totalled up to be very Guyish.  Dug it.   Our meals, however, were a bit up and down.  I'll describe each meal and dish seperately.   LUNCH:   2 people - 0 wait time  App:  Ultimate Chicken wrap - this was very good.  Consisted of a few small egg rolls, a few chicken skewers, and lettuce wraps with three sauces (spicy sweet/sour, soy, satay).  This was a great start to the meal.   Meal:  Tatted-Up Turkey Burger.  It is big and awesome.  Great flavor. This comes with a medley of fries with a very good seasoning.  I, now, have a mission to find ancho bacon.    IMPRESSION: This was a great experience.  My wife and I loved our meal.    DINNER:   5 people - 20 minute wait time  App:  Rojo Rings:   Both of these were brought out quickly.  The onion rings were good and crispy.  They had good seasoning on the batter and the sauce was great.     Nachos Del Jefe: The Nachos (holy batman!) were killer.  These little chips are a sublime mix of mild chorizo and cheese that bring flavortown down to it's knees praying.  They are that good.  Meal:  Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger: Friend had this and loved it.    Victors Street Tacos: very average and small.  the tortilla's weren't really prepped at all. Friend stated that this was bland and needed more salsa.   The Motley Que Sandwich: This was were the rails came off.  This sandwich is an exact replica of the Deli Cowboy from Jason's Deli.  It is a very saucy pulled pork.  All you can taste is a BBQ that I would expect any Joe Blow to be able to prep in their crock pot.  To make matters worse, the waitress stated that this sandwich was the absolute best thing on the menu.  I don't think the chick from Vegas knows what real BBQ should be.  When you have tp pay $20 bucks for it, it just makes you disappointed.    Dessert:   S'mores Monte Cristo: This was ok.  It looks cool, but it came accross too greasy.  it is really big and all in all, too much grease and sweetness to eat all of it.... even for 5 of us sharing one dessert.    I would have marked this a 5 after lunch... but, a few pieces of the dinner made this a big dip.  That Pulled Pork sandwich should really, really be re-considered.",

So can someone explain to me why when I went to Guy's restaurant in Las Vegas I was served PRETZEL RODS !!!!  Not pretzel breadsticks, not homemade, hot pretzels, hell I would have enjoyed a frozen pretzel not pretzel rods.  Funny how on the menu they don't say pretzel rods wrapped with pepperoni, but describe everything else on the plate with great detail.  Oh,and it was $13 for 8 pretzel rods.  This was done with an intent to deceive, no other way to explain it.  Why not be honest & say pretzel rods wrapped with pepperoni.  Mac & cheese burger was dry, with a spoonful of Mac & cheese.  I will say the fries were great, and the restuarant was funky/cool.  GUY, BE HONEST WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS BECAUSE YOU WERENT IM NOT COMING BACK.  You can get away with fooling people for so long.

For a $21 burger it better be done right. So I had them take it back. About 20 minutes later I get another one and now it's rare!!! I talked to the manager and she has the audacity to tell me it was their third attempt on making this. I told her, you have people that don't know how to cook back there!! Her excuse is that it is smash grilled and they can't take the temperature of it. I said really, you don't know how minutes to cook a damn burger??  It is sad this place has gone downhill and equaled to the failed Times Square place which is another story!!",

I couldn't bring myself to actually order the food after seeing the slop being served around me. I expected a LOT more from a place that carries Guy's name. He either doesn't monitor the standards of his namesake, or he just doesn't care. Shameful.",

They are frozen and then refried. The burger was served basically slightly above room temperature. Part of the experience of dining is to eat hot food! The fries were also same temperature as well. Didn't taste like right out the fryer. The other people I'm with got other food the same way. Disappointed. Thumbs down on not the taste but presentation. It's cold here this time of year. I expect hot food.",

The roast beef sandwich which was literally the driest roast beef sandwich I have ever tried to choke down. I was starving and could not even eat it. I also had a hamburger which was obviously made earlier in the day and then warmed on the flat top.  The hamburger was as you might have guessed incredibly dry to the point that I believe a puff of dust came out of my mouth when I bit in.  It does not stop there. The French fries were so old that they were cold and I even think the oil was starting to turn rancid from being so old.  Then the best part when I got the bill.  50 bucks for one of the worst burgers I have ever had?  Recommend that you steer clear.",

We ordered the trash can nachos which had beef brisket for the meat which was really good with bbq sauce for an appetizer. I had the big dipper which is really just a French dip sandwich it was so so the beef was dry and not much flavor to it, it came with seasoned fries and they were good. It also came with a pickle that was warm and not crunchy. My brother in law and his wife got the mac n cheese burger which looked good and tasted good. My wife and niece got the classic burger and it was ok. My nephew got the steak with mashed potatoes for 36.00 not worth it.  I had higher expectations for this place but for the prices of about 20.00 a burger not worth it probably won't come back again. But who knows one can never say never.  :-)",

My wife ordered a Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger and I got a Original Smash-Burger. We both agreed that this was a overly expensive burger for its quality. The burger seemed huge in size, but you'll notice that the burger patty is very thin actually, the big size of the burger is basically because they use a bunch of cabbage and the bun in tall, you can confirm that from other people's photos here at Yelp.  The fries that came with the burger were a joke, they were probably worse than McDonald's, and came with a ketchup-like (which was probably just ketchup) sauce.  The drink my wife ordered (named Smoke and mirrors) tasted and looked great.  Service was good, nothing really special about it.  We will never go back or recommend.",

That was kind of a downer. I think when you go to a good restaurant they ask you how you want your burger to be cooked and this place did not. unfortunately I don't think the added macaroni in a burger is worth the $20 charge for a burger and fries which normal places you'd pay anywhere from 10 to 15 bucks. I think that five dollars extra is just going to Guys pocket which is why he's driving a Lamborghini and you reading are driving a Honda Civic. Overall I probably won't be back if I want to grab a burger I will definitely go to Gordan Ramsay's restaurant down the street, cheers!!",

Our waitress, Michelle, was friendly, energetic and informative  she knew the menu very well (for only being open one week!) and was able to make great suggestions.   I had the Vegas fries and the blue-sabi sauce they came with was off the charts. My main course was the pastrami burger that was AMAZING!!  Even two of my sons, who are very picky eaters, were totally impressed with the bacon Mac n cheese burger. My wife had the carne Asada tacos that she said were some of the best she's ever had!!!  The entire experience was awesome and I am already looking forward to our next visit!",

The desserts were kind of disappointing, we sampled the cheese cake, smore, and fried ice cream.  The fried ice cream was pretty hard to include everything in it because the shell was so thick and I really hated that hay stuff they garnished it with, it got stuck in my through.  The cheesecake was a decent cheesecake and the smore was basic, I prefer a traditional smore.",

There were at least four different types of fries in the serving. They had a nice dusting of magic BBQ powder which made the meal just unique enough for a second look.

One ordered the Smash burger , one the Turkey burger , and 2 of us - the Mayor of Flavortown burger (couldnt be farther from the Truth). We also all split an order of Trash can nachos. Lets start with the nacho - Described as loaded with cheese , brisket , jalapenos , etc. The nachos came in a charcoal starter metal can. The waitress ejected them on our plate. It was hard to find any meat on them , jalapenos almost non existent , smotherthed in VELVEETA ?? cheese with stale Tostitos style chips. Any other ingredients almost non existent. No sour cream or guacamole all for $ 16.50. Enough for the four of us but what a joke !!  All of our burgers had the tiniest portions of fries. The buns on all 4 burgers were so small and disproportionate to the filling between the buns. We all agreed these were the most bland flavorless burgers we ever had. All Well Done when we all asked for Medium. These were close to 20 bucks each !! What a ripoff this place was !!! Do yourself a favor - Go to the smoky little dive bar called the Dispensary Lounge on Tropicana. Order the Steak burger with sauteed mushroom , bacon , and swiss with all the produce. Only $5.95 and one of the juciest BEST burgers in town. Trust me , I've been living in Vegas almost 6 years now !!",

I loved the concept of the fries you get on the side... It's a mix of curly, straight, crinkle, and waffle fries!  And the homemade ranch was perfect.  The two of us also shared the bowl-sized berry mojito and was a great value.  The drink was $38 which seemed high until we were both good and buzzed after only that drink.  The food was a bit overpriced though.  $21 for a burger is probably the most I've ever paid (including at other celebrity chef's restaurants on the strip), but at least the price included the fries.  Overall, it was the 3rd best burger I've had on the LV strip, behind Ramsay Burger and Bobby's Burger Place. BTW Service was GREAT!!! And the server said that Guy Fieri was a cool guy which is always good to hear about a family-owned place.  I can't remember the server's name but I wish I did because he deserves to be noticed.",

Full of flavor and grease and fat - everything you want in a burger. It would definitely be perfect after a night a drinking and debauchery.  I would eat this burger again.  But the drinks... Were not that amazing. Especially for $12 and whatever you do, do not get the cilantro cucumber mess. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck.  Last, and most important is the service. These waitresses were so nice.

Plus that presentation doesn't let you see all 3 types of fries.",

    "text": "I'm not big on writing reviews but this restaurant compelled me to do it.  You ever eat a meal and walk away no longer hungry but unsatisfied? This is how I felt about Guys Vegas restaurant. I expected more from a celebrity chef.   I ordered the original burger topped with a fried onion ring. The ring was cold and the burger was over cooked. If you're not going to ask me how i would like my burger cooked at least have the decency to give me a juicy burger. For $18 you better have something really tasty and memorable.  I also ordered the buffalo wings. The wings are like any other restaurant and not even the good ones at that. If your going to charge me $16 for wings, I expect to be blown away.  Definitely not worth spending your money here.  Who am I? I'm a chef, food blogger and culinary historian.",

    "text": "This awesome, new, rocking place put Gordon Ramsay's Pub (for one) to shame.  Friendly service, amazing food. Decent pricing. The front area is crammed as hell and really bottlenecks with people waiting in line vs. the people trying to leave. It is only 2 weeks old on this date so of course the place is jammed and you may have to sit at the bar for 45 min to wait for a table. (awwww, right?)  The staff will text you when your table is ready! There are plenty of TVs to watch your fave game at the bar. A must try is the guava cocktail with chili beer. The restaurant has a huge patio and is a great lunch spot also. You cannot be in a hurry when you come here. The food and drink takes a bit but I am sure there are kinks still being worked out and the wait IS WORTH IT! We ordered the shrimp lava tacos which our party gave a 3.5 out of 5, my other friend and I ordered the infamous, award winning mac and cheese burger (4 star). I was so excited to try it, I forgotten I had had a little burger already today at lunch elsewhere! Oh well - it was amazing and the kitchen even split it for us on 2 massive plates when they knew we were sharing. (no charge) The fries were so good,fresh, crisp and had 3 different types! What a treat! The burger was cheesy-rich but thank GOD we shared it. We also shared a Chinese salad (5 star) that had everything you would possibly want in it and the presentation was genius! Indescribable! The manager came by to see how everything was and was very gracious. Guy Fieri will be in tomorrow (May 2) night and Sat at lunch. Dammit, we are going to miss him, our loss! My favorite thing about this place is how most things have a spicy flair to them, food and drink! Lots of sharables, salads, sandwiches, burgers and tacos - that is what you will find here! Great atmosphere, cannot wait to come back!",

Everything we tried tasted like the salt shaker was poured into it. We were starving and didn't even eat it. The bartender was rude, we sat at bar and probably because we didn't order a fancy cocktail and had ordered a soda, when we downed our soda to was the salt taste from the food away, we had to beg for a refill. He then said he can only do one thing at a time and we would have to wait! Guy needs to do a surprise visit and go undercover in his restaurant to see exactly what is going on.",

The nachos were so amazing, the brisket meat did have bbq sauce on it but I loved it!! The burger was cooked perfectly and it had a ton of flavor. We actually went back again and we got the Asian chicken wraps and then the French dip type sandwich,  the name of it is escaping me. It was super good. We then got the fried icecream dessert which was so good and big. My husband and I split all of this and it was perfect. When we had the nachos from our first trip,  they were very very very filling. We powered through and ate our burgers because it was so delicious. But if you get the nachos I might suggest getting a lighter sandwich. We were not disappointed at all both times we went! The prices are not too bad, but it us vegas and everything is expensive. If you like bar food then I highly recommend this place. The service was ok. They kinda take their time but it is a pretty busy place so just be patient.",

The burger was well done.  We sat near the window and I loved the view out to the strip. Overall nothing worth coming here for except to say we've been to Guy Fieri's Burger Joint at the Linq.

The price was not bad at all for Vegas pricing, you get a nice size portion.   I will recommend putting your name on the list a little bit early because it does get pretty busy quickly, we were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar and our bartender was amazing and gave us great recommendations on the food as well as drinks.

We were instantly greeted and shown our table. Although, we weren't seated at the bar, the bartenders made us feel welcome as we passed by.   The service was quick and they managed to make conversation despite being packed. My glass was never empty and the servers were kind.   We ordered the Big Dipper, Triple T fries, Nachos Del Jefe, General's Wings, Margarita Fajita Wings, and Victor's Sweet Tacos. And for dessert we had the Triple Doublemint Pie. We were huge fans of the Margarita Fajita wings, the amazing truffles smothered all over the Triple T fries, Nachos Del Jefe and the Big Dipper.   The sauce for the Margarita Fajita wings was phenomenal. They almost took this off the menu, but we are so glad that they didn't. It was a sweet and sour sauce with herbs accompanied with perfectly cooked chicken. So worth it!   My brother loved the Nachos Del Jefe. Everyone else at the table enjoyed it, but didn't believe that it was \"spectacular\".   Everyone at the table loved the Triple T fries. There were truffles over the fries and within the sauce. There was so much, we couldn't possibly finish all of it, because the portion size was HUGE (which is a great thing).   The Big Dipper was a great sandwich. The manager came by to inquire about our experience and he informed us that they spent hours cooking the meat to perfection. It was seasoned well, and moist. It's a must try!   Overall, we enjoyed the food, service and staff. The managers even came by a couple times to personally talk and make us feel welcome while the servers were friendly and consistently checked on us in a pleasant manner.",

But our food came out fast, I'm glad we didn't order any appetizers! I had the mac & cheese bacon burger. It was everything I thought it could be and more. It was just delicious and I highly recommend it. It's cooked medium well but was still really juicy and loved the mix of fries you receive with it. It's a big burger and will get messy, but you will enjoy it!  My friend had the turkey burger and she liked hers as well. It was a great time, and the staff was very friendly. Thanks Guy! :)",

Wanted to have Bloody Mary's and breakfast today at the bar while watching our favorite NCAA team, but the person in charge would not change the channel to the game.  I asked everyone around us if they were watching the current game, which by the way was an NIT game, and no one was watching it at all and they didn't care.  We got up and left.  Went somewhere else that had the game on, and spent our $$ there.  Strong position for them to take on the first weekend of NCAA March Madness to play an NIT game when NCAA Tournament games are on.  When leaving and going to the new place, 99% of all TV's we passed had the NCAA game on.",

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I started with the Fireball Whiskey wings. These were very tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed them. If I had 1 criticism I wish they would have been a little crispier. My wife ordered the pretzel wrapped in pepperoni with a cheese dip. This was delicious as well. We the split the burger with Mac & cheese on it which came with a trio of fries. My wife really liked the burger but I was a little disappointed. I found the burger itself was over cooked. I prefer my burger to be medium rare & this burger was at least medium. The other ingredients on the burger provided a good mix a favor. The trio of fries were great. I would definitely eat here again but I'm not sure I would order a burger again. I debated on what star rating to give. I felt a 3 was too low but a 4 was a little high. I decided to go with a 4 because the service was very good and the appetizers & fries were great.",

It appeared that the gals there were more into talking to themselves instead of helping us out. wife and I walked here to have a couple drinks and try the food; however,  we went to the bar and the bartenders ( a bearded guy and a girl) were in deep conversation about something. Well I tried to get their attention but they would not look our way. Wife finally waved an employee down and asked if we could sit outside the bar area to watch the people go by. We eventually made it to that area and waited...and waited and waited and no one came to us to offer us anything.  We tried making eye contact with a couple employees that were near the area with negative results. I didn't want to be rude and scream for someone to assist us but nowadays it seems that it is what needs to be done in order to get some attention from employees. Well, we decided instead to go elsewhere.  As we passed by the hostess I told her that no one would assist us and she just smiled and said, \"sorryyyy\", and then went back to conversating with the other gals. So although we are big fans of Guy and his shows, we were unfortunately unable to try some of his food because of his inattentive staff in Las Vegas. So I guess the one star that I'm giving on this review is for the service and not the food as we were unable to try it. 2/4/2015",

The burger was dry and bigger than the bun....normally that's not a bad thing but in this case, the burger was dry, flat and burnt.  I almost sent it back.  My friend got the fish tacos which she said were just ok.   For the price and the name, I expected much more.  If it weren't for the lettuce rolls, this place would've gotten 2 stars.",

I have actually been there twice in the last 3 months. Once for dinner and once for breakfast, hoping for a over the top experience or one way ticket to flavor town.

    "text": "Decided to try this place out after seeing the long lines and stopping by Las Vegas this week.  The wait was not too bad, around 25 minutes.  The front staff was very courteous and friendly.  We obtained a table for 5 and were seated in a central location.  The ambiance was nice as the place has plenty of windows and you get a partial view of the strip and surrounding buildings.  I understand the place was busy, but our food did take 52 minutes to arrive to our table.  When I asked our server Gregory why the food was taking so long he said \"Its because you ordered appetizers\" as if I was being penalized for ordering 2 appetizers.  He didn't even apologize.  I asked for a manager who came by was very polite and apologized for the situation.  He offered free dessert, which I politely declined and stated I just really wanted to give him the feedback.  The server later gave us the check and asked if he could take our bill quickly so \"we didn't have to wait...\" with a sarcastic undertone.  Not nice... As far as the food goes, the appetizers we had were the cheese fries and the wings.  The fries were good, lots of cheese and flavor... The wings were just OK, and were a bit cold.  They have very little meat on them as they shave the bottom half of the wing to \"make it easier to eat\".  Some of the plates we ordered included the blue cheese burger and the original burger.  They were mediocre at best.  For a $20 burger, I was expecting something much better.  The meat was dry and the bun was brittle and didn't taste fresh.  At the end of the day there are plenty of restaurants in Las Vegas that deserve your time and money, and this clearly is not one of them.  I had high hopes coming into this place, but left disappointed.  Hopefully things change in the future.",

Greek salad has sardine dressing. It's not vegetarian! I just wish there was a little more variety on the menu. It's very much a cheesy, meaty, greasy mess. If you're lactose intolerant I wouldn't suggest either. They lost a whole table because I couldn't eat anything on the menu. Overall very disappointed....And I love Guy!",

    "text": "Its about time that a 5 Star chef came to town with a moderate priced place to eat.  Guy's place ROCKS!   Showed up at 6 pm on a Tuesday and we were seated right away.  Our server was fast to take our order with a wonderful smile and helpful information regarding the food.   My choice, Mac N Cheese and Bacon Burger. My husband got the Big Dipper Sandwich, smoked roast beef. My burger was out of this world, mac n cheese, perfectly cooked bacon, lettuce, cheese and a juicy burger.  The burger and all sandwiches are served with a side of assorted fries.   The only small thing I would have changed was the plating, its a small item.  The plating is done on a small wooden cutting board which doesn't leave a lot of room for your food.  Now my husbands sandwich, not our favorite, but that's a personal taste.  The roast beef was had a VERY HEAVY smoke to it.  Neither of us are huge fans of a heavy smokey taste to our beef/BBQ.  The meat was tender and juicy, just didn't care for the heavy smoke.   Total bill was $44 for both meals with included 2 pops.  Price isn't bad for a casual dinner on the Las Vegas Strip from a 5 Star chef.  Can wait for friends to come into town so we have an excuse to go back.",

    "text": "Late night I wanted a lite bite and wandered into GF's new Vegas outpost.  MISTAKE. It is way overpriced.  I know it's Vegas and it's on the strip.  Not my first trip here (30+ visits over the last 16 years).  But $12 bucks for what looks and tastes like Hormel chili out of the can with grocery store mix cornbread on top?    I thought GF would know real chili does not have beans.  He doesn't.  The cornbread fell apart immedaitely and was placed on top of the chili which prevents the scallions and sour cream that were on top of the cornbread from getting into the chili.  Such a simple dish done so horribly wrong.  Did I mention it was $12?  The sandwiches ($20) I saw served to those seated around me looked like something out of a dive (and not a good one).  The presentation said $7 not $20.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place.",

It was hot with corn bread and cheese. The service was something to be desired. It was cold and we were sat outside next to a gas heater. We were warm for a time, but the heater started to run out of gas and our waiter could not do anything. Our second course took forever and we were so cold that we asked for our food to go. The waitstaff was very slow to respond to our request to pay or for support.",

Bloody Marys were delicious.. BUT my biggest complaint would be they do not have Latte's I guess they have a Espresso Machine.. HELLOO even McDonalds has Latte's... so I am sure you can get a machine that is easy for your employees to use... so for that you only get 3 stars...",

Our cocktails where average at best, the cocktails waiters could use some additional training. Now on to the food... This would have to be some off the worst food I have eaten let alone at such a price. I order the Mac and Cheese burger and found it so dry that I was only able to eat half. My fiance had the ribs and found that they where 90% fat and incredibly chewy. Watching her try to eat them made me wonder if I was engaged to a hyena. We also order chilli cheese fries, these where probably the only decent dish. My suggestion if you really want to visit this place is head in buy a drink enjoy the service and maybe have some snack food, don't waste your time with a full meal.",

I had so much fun in the restaurant I literally left with a huge smile on my face!

    "text": "Disclaimer: I'm a Guy Fieri fan so my review will be a little biased. If u love triple D you're going to love this place!  From the first moment you walk in it screams Guy Fieri style. It's very rugged and a cowboy feel. The staff wears jeans and cowhide vest or aprons. Very cute!  Lots of little details. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the decor. I definetly appreciated it. For Guy fans, his UNLV coat is hanging by the kitchen entrance. I love the open kitchen concept! No fishy business behind doors!   We ordered the rojo onion rings. It comes on this nifty metal pipe. The oil dripping from it was mildly disturbing but you're not coming here to stay on your diet! They use nice thick cuts of onions you can really taste and the breading was pretty crunchy. The only downside is that the breading looks better than it tasted. It was very bland. We couldn't appreciate the sweet or spicy aspect..the breading was just crunchy.   The truffle fries were AMAZING though! The gouda on top and the dipping sauce were soooo good. We inhaled that thing! Definitely a must!!   We also ordered the mac and cheese bacon burger.  It comes with a side of seasoned fries cut into 3 different shapes. They were pretty darn good! We fought over the waffle shaped ones. The burger itself was a thin flavorless patty and the mac and cheese wasn't very cheesy. Very unfortunate.   Do try to save room for dessert! The S'more monte cristo is so amazingly good! When it comes out the marshmallow is melted and oozing out saying \"Eat me! Eat me!\" Very nice presentation..in fact everyone around us was asking about it and someone came over to take a picture. Now, this dish tasted as good as it looks! The brioche was nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Kind of like a funnel cake. I couldn't really taste the graham cracker but I didn't care because the chocolate and melted marshmallow was so good! It comes with a delicious raspberry sauce on the side and a dark chocolate sauce. I mostly used the dark chocolate sauce. As a chocoholic...u can NEVER have too much chocolate!   So I gave this a 4 star because the decor is nice, great service, short wait time for your food. That earned it 3 stars. For the 4th star...it really depends on what you get here. The burger and onion rings were bland but the truffle fries and the monte cristo was very very good. (Flavor town good!) So I gave it another star for those two items. I think its worth coming back to explore the rest of the menu but I would come back for those two things and be happy also!",

    "text": "It's Vegas! that's the attitude everyone on the strip has when something happens and there's no other explanation for it however, when it comes to food and a name like Guy Fieri, you'd better come up with something better. We went there to cap off our day on the strip and hopefully finish off on a good note. The restaurant sits in a pretty busy corner of the linq so expect constant traffic, noise and the occasional drunk A-hole who passes by your table and belts out some crude remark. The restaurant decor is very cool, we opted to sit outside but after a few minutes we knew we should have enjoyed the interior, especially on a hot day but we thought we should just tough it out after all, it's Vegas! We were initially seated right next to the railing but since it was windy, we asked to be seated further inward which sparked a look from our hostess as if we had killed her kitten. After sitting we waited about 10 minutes before our waiter realized we were sitting there (even though he passed by us several times) he promptly took our drink order and since we had been waiting a while we decided to give him our dinner order as well. The drinks arrived about 10 minutes later, the beer was cold and yummy, if you have multiple people in your party who drink the same thing I recommend the pitcher instead of individual drinks, it might save you a few bucks. about 20 minutes later our food arrived, the presentation was good but the portions were disappointing for the price. Now mind you,  it's Vegas! so be prepared to pay Vegas prices for anything you order especially at a place bearing a food network star's name. The burgers were OK but definitely not worth the hefty $20 price tag, you can find hearty, tasty burgers somewhere else on the strip for a cheaper price. The Greek salad was definitely disappointing, it was four large pieces of romaine lettuce with a small serving of mixed vegetables and some feta cheese in the middle, definitely didn't warrant the $20 price tag either. Then came the wings, you get 8 drumettes for $16, yes, that's $2 a wing drumette but hey, it's Vegas! We had both varieties, the hot wings and BBQ wings, both sauces were tasty but about halfway thru our wings we both got a couple of wings that were raw in the middle, we set those aside and ate the others. When our waiter stopped by again, we told him about it, he said \"I'll tell the manager\" took our plates, and offered to have the kitchen cook us a couple more, we declined, we didn't want to take a chance at this point. We lost sight of our waiter again until he came back and offered dessert, we looked at each other and wondered how his conversation with his manager went. We declined dessert and asked for our check. The check came, of course there was no adjustments for the uncooked wings but we thought the manager would stop in and apologize, of course he never did so we paid our bill and left. Now one thing to understand about my reviews, I don't expect any compensation when an establishment comes up short but I expect them to try, if they try I will give them full credit for it and consider that in my review. It appears Guy Fieri's Vegas restaurant is riding on his reputation, hinging on the possibility his name will excuse any sins his staff and management may commit but there's a long way to go for his name to fix all that. It's disappointing to see Guy Fieri's restaurant is just another pedestrian eatery on the strip that comes up short in all phases of operation, I would rest assured that if Guy was sitting at our table and witnessed our experience, there would be some vacancies at this location. There are hundreds of choices on the strip, make one of those other places your primary choice and avoid Guy Fieri's, your belly and wallet will thank you for it. And remember, after all, it's Vegas!",

    "text": "Just had tried the new breakfast menu at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen. I had the Dragon's Breath Chile Benedict - a generous portion of chili over house made cornbread rounds topped with cheese sauce and poached eggs. The sweet of the cornbread counters and compliments the savory chili, eggs and sauce nicely. As a side note, take your Zantac! My wife had the Carne Chiliquilles very flavorful but had to search for the beef.   Small ding to the score due tithe lack of beef, and some unhulled  garlic  in the chili.     Don't get me wrong, Guy has some great flavor profiles in his food much to his credit, And I look forward to returning to Las Vegas to give his Diner another try.",

My Hubs got told that the bacon mac n cheese burger was going to be the best burger he ever had so he was REALLY pumped because my Hubs REALLY likes burgers! Not, the best burger he has ever had. He said it was middle of the road. My burger? I got the simplest one on the menu and the beef patty itself was no more than 1/4 inch thick and it hung way over the bun. I may get shot for this, but my burger tasted exactly like a Harvey's hamburger (for those of you in Canada). I like a Harvey's burger, but I also only pay $5.00 for it.  The service was good although our server was a bit socially awkward. It made us laugh and he was truly sincere :-)",

Have you even tasted your own burgers that you sell and created?  It's like you grabbed the ground beef from the pack and smashed it up with no seasoning. One of the most flavorless bland burgers I have ever tried for over $20.  It's sad when I went to Jack in the Box the next day and the Ultimate Cheese Burger was better than a majority of Guys flavorless Burgers. FYI: If you eat here don't order a burger.  You will waist your money and feel the same way as you do when you lose at the casinos.   On a good note, the Ribs where amazing with that smokey flavor. Also the nachos are really good.   I will still watch Guys show but will never return to his restaurant.",

    "text": "I love Guy and triple d so I reallllllly wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I was disappointed.  I'm short, my experience was over priced and sub par.  At around 2pm on a Friday, There was quite a wait to sit inside, but immediate seating on the patio. We opted for the latter. The restaurant couldn't control the weather, but some misters out there would be nice.  The waiter took some time to get to us, which was particularly odd since there were only a couple tables seated outside. We ordered water and he had to come by twice to say our drinks were on the way... -_-  We passed on any appetizers as we found that section to be a little lacking. Actually, I expected more from the entire menu.  I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and my fiance ordered the signature mac and cheese bacon burger. We both finished our waters and didn't have a refill until after our food arrived.   My Cajun sandwich tasted like the chicken had been pre cooked and then reheated with the vegetables and seasonings separately. The cheese was melted into the roll and then the filling placed on top. When it arrived, the cheese had hardened again-as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp for some time after being cooked. I asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...I finished half my food before it arrived.  The \"signature\" burger wasn't all that much better. First, they need to use a different bun. It fell apart immediately. The burger itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. I think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese was bland. The blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. The bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.  I will say the fries were good. A combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some BBQ cheddar kind of seasoning.  It seemed like everything on the menu was $20. We passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/",

    "text": "It hurts my heart to give Guy's restaurant a 3. It just didn't blow my mind as I thought it would.  First off, the menu is extensive and everything that Guy Fieri stands for. The menu even reads like Guy talks. Fries, loaded fries, wings, burgers, brisket, sandwiches, salads, dessert...it's a big menu. They also have breakfast as well. I would like to come back and try breakfast -- we came for lunch.  We started off with the Fireball Whisky Wings - they were an interesting flavor, you can definitely taste the Fireball, but they were a bit dry. The wasabi blue cheese that it comes with is delicious. Overall, not my favorite. I'd like to try the General Tso's next time as our neighbor table got them and enjoyed them a lot. The burgers sound ginormous, but they actually are very manageable, so don't be afraid. I got the Triple B Burger ($19 creole blackening spice, blue cheese, bacon,lettuce, tomato, onion, donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche). Underwhelming in flavor - I wouldn't order it again. My girlfriends both got the Mac & Cheese Burger and they loved it.   The service was the pits. We were drawn in by the \"Hangover Recovery- Build Your Own Bloody Mary\" sign, as we really needed a recovery. When I asked our waitress if I could see the Bloody Mary menu, she said \"pick a vodka and pick a spice level 1-5.\" We had no idea how much they cost and were disappointed because that didn't seem like \"building\" to me. I went on the website to look at the food menu to help jog my memory as I write this review, and, there is absolutely a menu for the build your own bloody mary (you choose a protein, you choose garnishes...I'm irritated).   I would go back, because it's Guy Fieri, and the menu is extensive so I would hope for better service and to try something else that I would enjoy more.",

I ordered chicken wings and had no complaints. Crispy, traditional buffalo sauce (no weird proprietary sauce), crisp veggies. They were really quite delicious. Winner, winner, chicken wings! (Yes, I know that's not how that goes). I don't recall what my wife ordered (see first sentence of this review), but it certainly wasn't great. She was less than thrilled- even a little upset. Oh! I just remembered! She got a veggie burger. The taste was okay, but it was so crumbly it just fell apart all over the plate. The fries were nothing to write home about. As with most restaurants on the strip is was slightly overpriced, which is to be expected. And it's noisy. There is indoor and outdoor seating which is nice. It was just fairly generic food for a chef's restaurant. Sort of like eating at a Cheesecake Factory with a much smaller menu. Probably won't go back.",

The menu wasn't very big, classic strip menu, so it didn't take long to pick an item.  I had the Baja Bowl with Shrimp. The bowl was very tasty! Perfect amount of sauce, the sweet corn was tasty, I should have gotten no pickled onions. My friend who I ate with got the Mac n Cheese burger, he seemed to really enjoy it! To me, the Mac n cheese did not look creamy so it stayed on the burger without falling out but that didn't look appetizing. I'd definitely return and try more!",

    "text": "Out of all my stops on my recent Vegas trip, this is the place I was most excited to review.   I wouldn't say I am the biggest fan of Guy Fieri, but I do enjoy his shows and his recipes. When I saw he had a place in Vegas, I was like \"Oh, I definitely have to stop here.\"   Now if you've come across this place on Yelp, you're probably thinking, \"Wow, this place looks good. Kind of pricey, ratings are meh, but it just looks so good. Should I go?\" (At least, this is what I was thinking ).   Now to answer your question, yes you should go. This place was AMAZING. Literally, my brother kept staring at me eat (I couldn't put my food down and I just kept eating like a pig. Not ashamed to admit it. It was just that good). I got the Ringer Burger, of course. That is definitely something I recommend. Was the absolute best burger I ever had. My company enjoyed their meals as well. This meal was the only Vegas meal we all finished. It was just that darn good.   Now, I do have some complaints that is stopping me from giving it the full on 5 stars, like the food deserves. The staff here is very bleh. They aren't very friendly and they honestly did not seem to want to do their job at all. I get it, no one really wants to be working, but they were just really slow and not really engaging with the customers.   Would I still recommend this place though? Absolutely. Would love if they hired some new staff though.",

Of course, everything was overpriced. The portions were pretty big though. There's a good drink menu but it's Vegas...  They had no birthday specials or anything...  We got the burger and a burrito wrap. The food was mediocre at best. I really wanted to like this place and am a big fan of Guy. I was disappointed with my first time trying a Guy place.   Our server was excellent though and tipped pretty well despite the food and pricing.   Location is nice and this could be a place you might want to try once. Maybe their dinner food is better.",

    "text": "I went to this place with an open mind as personally I do not care for the person whose name is on the building. He had opened a Restaurant in Bakersfield which after temper tantrums and arguments with partners got closed.  I remember when he was an unknown star trying out on television. HE had some air time personality but to me his cooking skills just did step up to it. We decided to eat there as we were attending an event next door and didn't want to travel all over town. When making arrangement we advised we had a large party 18. Screech!!!!! As you stomp on the brakes, we were told in order to accommodate that large of a crowd you are only allowed to pick from a pre made menu and have a final dollar guarantee.  Ok fine, sad thing is had we ordered off the menu they would have made much more money, as my guests like their food and we didn't have a budget. We set up out times had to prepay in advance. Following days we arrived. We got to the front where we had to wait 5-10 minutes. Thought this was all set up. Seating no private dining area but off to one side against the windows. It was not the best spot but it was ok. !!0 plus degrees sitting at a window is not always that fun. Maybe the reason for the initial wait was to get food started for us as shortly after seating  Caesar salads and Jalapeno poppers were placed family style at our table. The Caesar was nothing special but everyone seemed to be eating them instead of the poppers. The \"pig \"poppers in my opinion are a big flop. These guys were hot, most at our table would not eat them. I do enjoy hot spicy food but if they want the average person to enjoy maybe they need be seeded when they are stuffed. They were a nice size but I feel they needed to be cooked more. I think they brought 6 orders to our table and sadly less than one plate was eaten I had two as I can handle the heat, most everyone else passed. One other thing we got on our table was \"trashcan nachos. I will say this was a clever way of serving them. There were built up in a tall vessel about 8 inches across and a toot tall. It looks like they build them up keeping it in a nice shape till they come to the table then the wait staff slides up the devise and they lay in a tall heap and fall apart as they are eaten. They were good but they were just nachos. The best thing to them was how they were served.  Our main courses we had 7 items to pick from several burgers an Alfredo, a Baja bowl chicken and a pork sandwich. I took the mac and cheese burger. They claim it's voted best burger in Vegas by Seven magazine, only ad I could find from this magazine was from 2017 and Fierri was not on the list. I ordered the burger less tomato, lettuce, onion and pickle. I wanted to taste this mac and cheese. As I'm dissecting the burger I didn't notice the bacon or onion straws on it. Just a burger with a big lump of man and cheese on it and a bun. The Mac did have a nice creamy consistency to it with a nice cheese flavor. Knock my socks off good no, but good enough. I'm eating this more in a knife and fork fashion to get the flavors in it when I get to the burger patty. I do not know what kind of meat product he uses but if I had to guess I would say its frozen pre made patties. It had that old burger flavor to it. The fries were a sorry excuse for French fries. Not only did they skimp on the portion but they were limp and oily. For desert they brought out 4 \"strawberry fools\" basically just a strawberry short cake with ice cream and whipped cream. The four large clear glass containers had spoons inside so you just dug out what you wanted. The pound cake had nothing to compare like Mastros Butter cake, whip cream ice cream and berries. What can I say you really can't ruin them?  The one thing I will say is the service was good. But then that's what Fierri was trained to do Hotel & Restaurant management he never was a trained Chef and I hate to say it but in my opinion the food shows it. At the end of the night we dropped several thousand dollars for what I feel was subpar food.  The burgers were no better Red Robin that you can find in every mal in the US.  The service was better than many places but it is like putting lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. In this area where the restaurant is located there are many much better opportunities for good food and good values. I think one place Id keep walking past.",

    "text": "I expected a little more. The food wasn't horrible, it was actually pretty good at first (maybe I was just really hungry). But I wish I loved it more coming from Guy Fieri. The price point is expected. My boyfriend and I shared two dishes:   Trashcan Nachos ($20): unique concept, definitely shareable and a must try for first timers. Warning: there is LOADS of cheese. I love cheese and I feel that there is too much cheese. The top of the nachos were crunchy and crisp but as we made our way to the bottom the heaping amounts of cheese were just too much and the nacho chips were soggy. I started to get sick of it. The jalapenos and onions are a nice touch though. The meat that is aded on this is also just ok.   Sriracha Wings ($16,50 at 8 pieces): I supposed the wings are not treated with hormones because they are pretty small. The sriracha dry rub was tasty but nothing that stood out to me. It wasn't spicy either. They give you about 2 pieces of celery and 2 slices of carrots along with a side of ranch.   Customer service is ok. Servers weren't bad but they weren't very attentive either.",

I would say that they do good business, but it's nothing bad is going to knock your socks off. The wait was about 20 minutes, although they did offer available sitting at the bar, the food was tasty, but the length of time that it took from order to food on the table was probably their greatest downfall.   What does restaurant does well: They have a great location, and lots of foot traffic, so I think their advertisement is strong, they also have a fairly put together a menu that allows you to pick what you want and see everything very clearly, it made me feel like they have a few items but do what they do pretty well.   What this restaurant could work on: there are speed and efficiency, the staff could be much more friendlier, the food was nice but not exceptional, I feel like they could offer a more distinct taste. The presentation is very beautiful though.   I wouldn't go back the price is a bit high for the taste quality.   Also, they do provide rather large portions, so that was nice considering the price.",

This joint can be poppin at times so be prepared for a short wait if you go during peak hours, but it is a worthwhile wait.  The staff do offer a friendly greeting upon your entrance and take your parties information as they inform you of the wait time, if any.  He interior is fun and seems a good manifestation of Guy's personality.  Not dull by any means and not too flashy as you might expect after seeing Guy's hair.  The tables are of good size and spaced well enough apart that you are not too bombarded by the other Vegas patrons as they hungrily and loudly visit and eat.  The food selection is pretty Southwestern American  and pretty damn tasty.  I have been here 3 times, once with a large group which allowed me to sample a variety of menu items in one sitting and I pretty much liked everything I tried.  My only gripe was the trash can Nachos as they literally come in a miniature can you then get dumped on your plate.  Not bad tasting but what a mess.  I found myself gravitating to the chili the most, looooove me a good chili and the one offered here is pretty good.  This might be one of my favorite spots to eat in Vegas and if I do go back to Vegas I will go back to this place to eat.",

I am not a blue cheese fan but the dressing was not terrible. I did not love it but I actually did not hate it either.   Mac n Cheese Burger - The burger was packed with flavor. We did enjoy this as the mac n cheese was not overwhelming. It was the perfect amount of cheesiness for the burger. Because everything was topped, I could not really tell how great the meat patty was.  Fry Trio - This was underwhelming. They were stale and felt like they were sitting out for a very long time.

The wait was not as long as we thought it would be and they text you when the table is ready so you don't have to stand around.  I was so impressed with the service. Usually these 'star is born' restaurants are busy and lack service but not Vegas Kitchen. Our server was great, our drinks always full, food came fast, she knew her menu. Most impressed that when the food came out we where not asked who ordered ? The food was good but I think I was expecting some more punch from the meals. Maybe cause I see some incredible stuff on his show. Drunken tacos okay, french fires WOW! The Mac Burger was very good. I live in Vegas and when visitors come, I would take them if they are a Guy Fieri fan.",

After ignoring us oddly for a little, we where shooed out rudely, then two minutes past eight (about two minutes later) where let in.  We had the dragon breath chili Benedict and the French toast. The toast was burned, and no matter how rustic that looks, it tastes bad. The egg wash hadn't penetrated, so it was basically just burned bread with bacon that had its flavor killed by way too much sugar. And bananas with caramel. Way way too sweet. There was also a shot glass with watermelon juice and mint. It sounds yummy, but was badly done. Tasted like nothing The eggs where somewhat better. The corn bread was way too sweet (definitely a theme at this place). The chili boring except for a hint of cilantro seed. This would have been ok had it been a five buck meal at a truck stop. Not a 17 dollar investment. All in all, the worst food we've had in Vegas so far. The orange juice and tea where ok",

The Victors tacos were really good, but we didn't care for the carne Asada.   The drinks were watered down but we weren't charged for them so no foul there.  Our waiter was tripping on something. We had a good laugh all night watching this guy. He couldn't stay focused long enough to take or drink order.  Look, we went into this knowing it is a \"gimmick\" joint that brings you in just because you saw this guy on t.v. and he told you where to get those really good donuts in Texas should you ever be unfortunate enough to find yourself in Texas.  Also, we know that being on The Strip we'd be paying a premium. If this were any other location I'd be ticked at the whole experience.  This place is as average as Applebees and Chili's.",

The presentation of the nachos was pretty exciting. I mean...it shows up in a can! I thought the bbq on nachos was weird so I opted out on that! I really like the tortillas. They were thick and made to hold a lot of ingredients and I don't think I had a soggy chip. I wish there was a kid menu but I guess, you don't get many kids in Vegas? But I would some here again for the nachos. I shared it with my hubby and we were both full on just the nachos.",

The service was slow and almost to seem that I was a bother rather then a customer. The bartender was more concerned with counting his tips. I ordered the burger rare and was told they would only do them medium well. (not a good start) I ordered it anyway as I just got off a 5 hour flight and was exhausted. The burger was surprising good however even being over cooked for my liking. It all worked and the bun was Delicious as well. It had a lot going on but was still really good. The fries were not to my liking. 3 different types of fries with hot seasoning on them. They were hot, I just didn't like them. In the end I'm giving them 3 stars although I was hovering over 2 due to the bar tender.",

Fries weren't at all crispy, blue cheese was sparse, and they weren't very warm. The general tso wings were just bad. So DRY!!!

Place gets pretty packed, and the tables are awkwardly close together so be warned you may be literally rubbing elbows and bumping into others trying squeeze around the place. You can choose to sit indoors or outdoors but either option looks Jam packed no matter what time of the day. The overall vibe is cool and casual - very fitting for what you'd expect of a Guy Fieri restaurant. The music they play there is fun and upbeat, seems to be a lot of hip hop especially old school. Service was ok, not top notch, but the wait staff did their jobs and nothing above and beyond.   The food was pretty amazing. There's definitely a ton of flavor packed in everything we tried there, especially in any foods that are spicy. We hugely recommend the lobster tacos (that dirty rice is damn tasty!) and the Kobe burger (fries are a mix of crinkle cut and waffle cut and deliciously flavored). They also have a lot of fun cocktails and fishbowls as well as a decent, but not exhaustive, beer list. It is a bit pricey though and not what we would normally pay for lunch, but it's a good casual place to go to when you don't feel like dressing up and when you want decent portions of food to indulge on.",

I opted to go for one of their signature cocktails that they had on the menu and it was delightful and really refreshing.   The trash can nachos were amazing and so were the fries! It was really delicious. My high expectations were met with great food. My friend ordered the bacon Mac and cheese and he seemed to enjoy it.   I wanted to try some dessert but my stomach just didn't have the room for it. I was so full off of the appetizers and entrees that there was no way I could finish off the dessert.

Mac n Cheese burger, Sarrachi wings, chicken tortilla soup, fries, and the chicken permaroni for dinner then finished with the strawberry fool for dessert. Chicken parmaroni was the only good item that you wanted more. Everything else was just okay for me. I can say I tried but that's about it folks and I dropped $115 without tip. I've enjoyed far better for less money. Not impressed.",

We ordered the \"Trash Can Nachos\" not really expecting much they are just Nachos right? No, they were actually bomb! Very pleased! We will be back to have more our next go around to Vegas.",

My go-to is the Flavor Town Burger.   The name is right on point.    It ooozes flavors and is everything right and good about Vegas food indulgence.   Now, just because that's my go to, don't discount the Turkey Burger or Chicken.   They rock too!     My most recent surprise was passing on the Flavor Town to try the Brisket Nachos and...  oh yeah.   Oh sweet wonderful messy goodness.  I must have been making sounds or faces eating them because the table next to me asked if they were really as good as they seemed.    They were.    I really love it when a place has a menu so densely packed with great food that I am not afraid to explore.   Too often places have 1-2 great items and the rest is just there for the appearance of variety.    Guy Fieri's is crushing it.   Flavor.  Flavor.  Flavor.",

My husband and I each got a burger, and it was good.  My daughter got the chicken Caesar salad, which she enjoyed, but wished the lettuce was chopped up a little finer, instead of the huge leaves.  Another in our group got the vegan burrito and seemed happy with it.  Overall, I'd say this place is a better lunch option than for dinner.  They have a covered patio, which would be a great option for people watching.  We ate indoors, and although it was a little loud, it had a fun atmosphere.",

All but one of us ordered breakfast.  I wish the hash browns were more unique.  They tasted and looked like hash brown patties that were diced up.  The rosemary bread had a nice delicate crust but you have to really like rosemary.  The french toast was good and had been dipped in a banana custard which was nice.  My son commented that it tasted like toasted banana bread.  Again, nothing standout and it would've been nice with a better presentation and perhaps some whipped cream.  My lone decenter that doesn't like breakfast ordered the wings which he said were good.  They did look very good.",

The pops were good and the lobster was fried perfectly. The different kinds of fries was super confusing.   So let's get to why I have it 3 stars instead of 5. The service, it wasn't what I would expect from a place like this. Our waitress had about 5 tables in our section and I think in the hour-ish we were there I saw her a total of 4 times. She kept disappearing. I saw the bus boy offering to fill my water more than her. The food is decent, but the service just wasn't fulfilling to me.",

I liked the sauce that was in the lollipops the best.   The burger was ... amazing. The thick bacon, scoop of Mac and cheese, well cooked burger and special sauce made the burger to die for.   Although there isn't a kids menu (-1 Star) they do offer a side of Mac and cheese or a plain burger (+1).   Glad we made it here and would definitely be back!",

My dad had the ringer burger. He enjoyed it. I've had it in the past and I liked it. The only complaint I have with burgers at any of Guy's restaurants is they smash the burgers. I hate that. I love burgers and eat them all the time. A great medium rare burger is my favorite thing to eat but you can't have that when it's smashed.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying the food itself was good and tasty. Pricing-wise, it is in line for a tourist place on the Las Vegas strip.  The service however, was lacking. The hostess  had no personality and seemed to not even want to be there. I thought the staff would reflect Guy's outgoing personality. As we waited for our table, there was no chatting, or even asking how we are doing and I don't think she even made eye contact. Just chewed her gum and went about her business. Definitely needs better training or a better personality. (this was on April 12, 2018 around 9pm)  Overall the staff seemed blah. Our waiter was friendly, though not super attentive in checking back with us. Food came out correctly for my fellow friends, but mine was not. They did however fix it somewhat. The water guy was on point though, which is good! Hate being thirsty. Kudos to him.   Overall for the food, I think it was 4 stars for taste. But for the price/service/dining experience, I'm rating 2 stars, since that's just as important. Hopefully they improve and I think his place will be great!",

Decided to go back Saturday evening since i was craving their Mac'n'Cheese Burger. Got to the host and we were told the wait would be 25 minutes, it was 3 of us. 2 of us decided to go to the rr in the meantime...Once we were out we got seated (was so happy we had no actual wait time) As we sat, i recognized the waiter who took care of us on  Thu, told him i recognized him etc he then proceed to go inside (we sat outside) Next thing you know i see another worker storming towards us, he stated he was refusing our service and we had to leave! We were beyond dumbfounded as we had literally sat down! We asked what the reason was, he refused to state any reason besides he was refusing our service. He was very rude and just kept ranting we had to leave and he was refusing service. We then walked out and asked to speak to the manager...he was the manager! He then went out and we politely asked for the reason and he just stated you need to stop harassing my staff, you are being disruptive and cursing! all lies!! we literally were there for no more than 10 minutes, told the waiter we recognized him and then suddenly got kicked out! this was an overall very humiliating experience. Despite the good food i have no desire to go back due to the lack of customer service coming from the manager!!!!!",

    "text": "Super fun place to eat, loved the decor and the option to sit inside or outside.  Food was delicious! Hubby ordered French toast and the Hangover Bloody Mary, and I ordered the vegan burrito. French toast was the perfect blend of sweet and savory, with multiple textures. The caramelized bananas and strips of bacon rounded out the meal. Hangover Bloody Mary has a bit of anything and everything: sausage, bacon, orange, lime, jalapeno, pickle and green olives topping off their house made Bloody Mary mix, Amazing! The vegan burrito was delicious; however, I ordered it without the tortilla, and it was brought with the tortilla, when it arrived it was served in a super funky industrial looking bowl, super cool. The bowl size was too large for the portion I received, it barely filled the bowl 1/4 of the way, feeling like I was missing part of my food. The flavors were delicious though, and if it had been served over corn tortilla chips as nachos, it would have been perfect as a gluten free substitute.  The front staff were kind and welcoming, our server was not terribly great. I asked for a straw from the gentleman who delivered my water and I never received it.  I watched another busboy not hold a door for an elderly lady as she was walking through.  I think the server only checked on us 1 time prior to delivering our check, and didn't seem to notice my husband's food came out well before I received my dish that I could eat.    Overall, food received 5 stars, service only 3.5 stars. Food can be good, but service needs to step it up a bit to match the caliber of the food and restaurant.",

    "text": "Have to say that we weren't all that impressed with Guy's. Our trip to \"Flavortown\" wasn't that impressive. We tried the Mac n Cheese Burger with the Mac n Cheese being the only remarkable thing about the burger. The Mac did taste better than anything I've been able to make at home.   We also tried the 67 Cajun Chicken sandwich which had horribly dried out chicken (as if was 2230 hours it may have been leftovers from the swing shift). It came with a sauce that helped with the dryness but it was still a very disappointing sandwich.   Only saving grace was the Triple T fries. Truffles Truffles and more Truffles as the menu described. They were thinly sliced fries perfectly fried, crispy and seasoned; as my Fiance described them \"OMFG these are the best fries I've ever had\" I did have to agree.  Our waiter explained after our ordering  it was his time to go home and passed us off to another. Our server then spent 30 mins at the bar doing prep work and that was the last we saw of anyone till I finally got up grabbed the first person I saw and asked for our bill.   We had to wait 20 minutes for a table as they refused to give us a reservation (their policy I'm guessing to have people lined up outside to make them look popular/ busy) there were empty tables every where when we sat but we were given a two top that didn't have room for all our food. Think of the user experience that late at night and give them a real table for heavens sake.  All in all it was a disappointment but if in the area we may see if we can get those fries to go.",

Well this on is next to the Quad by the Linqs and the new high roller. Once we sat down and got our service it was below average at best. Server we had was not very accommodating and seems like the attitude was coming. I ordered the off the hook burger it was oil and sloppy. My other party ordered the Mac and Cheese burger this one was dry and had no flavor at all. A side of Mac and Cheese for my baby, ate one bite and didn't want it. Other kid places that have mac and cheese he love, and this is suppose to be good? Not good for kids! No kids menu is offered at this place. too expensive to order for a kid or child and not worth it.  Female server was not helpful as I stated earlier. I ordered iced tea and I had to ask for a refill and it took forever to come back with that refill.  I've ate at many burger places and other have not even disappointed like this one. At lease if the service was superior like it should of been anyways.  at least my rating on this establishment  would of been better than a one starer.  But a double whammy killed it on the head!!!!!",

My meal was pretty good except the over cooked chicken skewers, I would have preferred more lettuce and chicken filling to the skewers. Service was shotty. Hardly got checked on, cups sat empty a few times then when we were finished and ready to go it took 10-15 minutes for our waiter to get a check. The place wasn't packed so I expected quicker service, but maybe it was an off day for the guy.   So....we gave them another chance tonight. We were given a \"late night\" menu, which I wasn't expecting. I was going to have the lettuce wraps again but they weren't available. Kind of frustrating to get there and not have a full menu to choose from. I got the nachos instead and they were pretty good. I especially liked the fresh cut jalapeno, but would have preferred freshly grated cheese to the canned cheese. Again the service was bad. The waitress seemed mad we didn't order a dessert and  was growly when asking if she could clear the plates. Didn't offer a box or ask if everything was ok with our meal (we both had more than half of our food left) again we waited for the check for about 10 minutes. The food was decent, the service sucked. Don't plan on visiting again. Crappy service isn't worth the decent food.",

I don't know what happened, I think it's just simply a hit or miss thing. If they work on consistency then it would be perfect. Other than that  the customer service was good.

Realistically you're paying for the name and the fact that it's in Vegas. The burger was alright, that is until the end. When I was at the end of the burger it was pink and cold. Immediately disgusted. I would have sent it back but it was already 3/4 of the way gone. The fries were good. Don't know what they season them with, but damn. Decent service too. There's so many places to eat in Vegas. Wish we would've done our research and gone somewhere else.",

I'll be honest, the food wasn't bad, but our expectations were super high. What did we have: Apps - pretzel sticks wrapped with pepperoni and the Vegas fries were probably the best part of the meal. Main dish - two of us had burgers.  They were ok...nothing special.  The bbq ribs had to go back because they just weren't good.  The only thing worth mentioning was the pulled pork sandwich.  My wife had this and said it was good, but not great. We actually skipped desert and moved on. To summarize, I would wait 30-60 minutes to eat here and I wouldn't pay $19 for a burger here either.  Not worth the price...I'm disappointed because I had such high hopes...",

The not as good: Service at the bar was pretty spotty. I sat needing something a couple of times for several minutes, with the bartenders blowing by me to wait on people who just came up, or work ahead organizing tabs, or put away glasses. I was a bartender and I get it when you are busy, but these guys would just go for really long stretches of time and never make eye contact with me. Didn't ask me how my food was, didn't offer me another drink until I was well past done with everything. It was to the point that the people next to me laughed at my ongoing efforts to get their attention. When I'm paying $32 for an entree, I'd like service that is a lot more attentive.   I have to say that I've had better poutine for a third of the price, but the people around me seemed to be enjoying their hamburgers. As for me, I have to say I would most likely skip this place next time.",

    "text": "2 words: FOOD POISONING!!! Let me start this by saying that I do not drink alcohol so that y'all don't think it was alcohol poisoning.   I ordered the burger that had bleu cheese. I'm not quite sure what it was called, but i know it was $18.00. I also ordered the Vegas Fries as an appetizer for our table to share.  The fries were nothing special. They are wedge cut and come with some sort of ranch dressing on the side. I really only ordered them because I LOVE bleu cheese.   As soon as I bit into my burger, I told everyone sitting with me that the burger was not good. It was extremely dry and the meat was soooo thick it was hard to chew and even harder to swallow.   Anywho, I did not like the burger but I ate it anyway because I was starving. I couldn't finish it because it was soooo dry. So I left a little less than half. I was completely unsatisfied but I did not care enough to send it back.   We paid and went on our merry way to enjoy our last night in Sin City. I got back to the room and a few hours later I had to run to the bathroom to throw everything up. I'm sorry if this is too much info but it's what happened. I threw up 4 times and all 4 times it was the hamburger patty and the bleu cheese. It was the worst feeling ever. And then a little something else hit me, but I won't mention that. Around my eye area, I saw that I was starting to develop these little red dots all over and a little above my forehead. It had to have been an allergic reaction to the bad meat. Now I thought it was just me, but that morning when we were heading down to valet, one of the girls who was in our party but staying in a different hotel told me she threw up 3 times and it was ALL of the burger. She had the same burger as I did. Coincidence? I think not.   2 nights before, we had eaten at Gordon Ramsay's BURGR, and I had also ordered a burger with bleu cheese and I was perfectly fine.   I hate to base my review on my experience but I can guarantee I'll never go back because just the thought of walking by there makes me sick to my stomach.   I had to catch a flight back and I was terrified of not making it to the bathroom in time in case it hit me again.   I will say this, even before I got sick, I did not like the taste of any of the food.   Sorry for the TMI but I just needed to get this out there.",

Also I ordered the brisket nachos, and I took a few bites, and the meat seemed old and dried out and the cheese had a looked like it was cheese in a can, but I tell you the food poisoning was the worst part I vomited later that night and had diarrhea for two days. I will never go back to that restaurant and honestly I should've gotten a refund. Guy fieri if you see this your establishment has no business being called a restaurant.",

Sure enough, we all show up and the greeter says they don't take reservations and it'd be a 90 minute wait.  Wait, what?  Needless to say that struck a nerve with all of us.  Despite telling the greeter, who we spoke to on the phone, they weren't prepared for us.  A member of our group even took to Twitter asking for some assistance -- nothing.  In any case, we waited probably an hour or so to be sat and the waiter, who shared a similar likeness in his hairstyle to Guy, seemed rather overwhelmed by us.  He said he was only going to repeat the fixed menu once (we're 17 people in a LOUD restaurant dude) and I kind of knew what type of experience we were going to have based just on our initial observations.   The food was OK ... Nothing I'd return for, let's put it that way, and I'm being objective.  The service, on the other hand, was bad.  I'm sure the tip was included for a party of our size, and I think that often people tend to feel that when that's the case, they don't have to put in as much effort.  Things like water being refilled, dishes being cleared, even a \"how is everything\" were absent.  It's a gimmicky restaurant -- I get that -- but after our experience, not only would I not return, but I wouldn't recommend it.  There's just too many other places to eat in town and there wasn't anything that made me want to return.",

I was a little apprehensive at first to see how good the food was going to be but my wife really wanted to go, so we went.  There was a small 5 minute wait to get a table but once we were seated the server was right there to get our drink and food order.  So, even though it was busy, our total wait time was not bad.  My wife had the French toast and she thought it was superb.  She was very happy that even though the bread was very thick, the toast was cooked all the way through.  She was also impressed that the food was served with the maple syrup heated.  A big plus in her book.  I had the flat iron steak with eggs and home fries.  I ordered the steak medium rare and I actually got it as ordered.  I have to say that the steak was better than some I have eaten for dinner at steak houses.  The eggs were the perfect amount of runny to make the home fries great.  All in all, I have to say that we were both impressed with the food, service, and price.  If we ever come back to Vegas, we will have to try either lunch or dinner there.",

Just know that this place is loud and full of tourists that have a hard time containing their enthusiasm about being in a place named after a TV host. The tables are uncomfortably close together too so be prepared for an intimate meal with loud strangers.  I ordered the '68 Cajun sandwich. The food was good although I expected it to have a bit more kick to it as far as the spiciness factor goes. It's pretty big. I had to use my knife and fork to break it down. My jaw was starting to hurt from trying to eat it like a normal hoagie. The menu doesn't state this but the sandwiches come with a small side order of fries so don't feel obligated to order one of the big-ass plates of specialty fries on the menu. Unless you want to.  For dessert, my wife and I split the the Triple Double Pie which is chocolate chip mint ice-cream combined with crushed wafer cookies and mint candy. More chocolate than mint. Our waiter referred to it as the Mount Fuji. Be warned that this dessert is ideal for four people. It was all we could do to finish it. The manager even approached our table to express his congratulations to us for finishing it.  If you enjoy loud, festive atmospheres with sports blaring in the background and you're okay with confined spaces, you'll like this restaurant.",

He's known for a reality TV show, his food is glorified junk food and he's got a super-outgoing personality that is easy to make fun of. That being said, who doesn't love watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives? And who doesn't love yummy junk food? That's why I love eating at Guy Fieri establishments and I ask you not to judge me until you try it for yourself!   My first Guy Fieri experience was in Las Vegas at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar, located in the LINQ Hotel Carnival Food Court. When you are hungover, nothing sounds as good as a (veggie) burger and fries dripping with grease and cheese. No one in my group had ever eaten Guy Fieri food so we stopped by. My friend Cindy asked, \"What is Guy Fieri's food like?\" Pointing to the menu and reading off the first thing I saw, which was a marble cheesecake topped with potato chips, pretzels and melted fudge, was the best way to describe what she was getting herself into.   When I saw the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger, I just had to have it in and around my mouth. Unfortunately, for some reason Guy Fieri does not offer a veggie burger???!!! So I ordered this burger without the burger...and without the bacon. Still, I got a huge pile of six-cheese macaroni and cheese in between a garlic buttered brioche bun, topped with super-melty cheese, donkey sauce, lettuce, tomato onion and pickle. It was a sight to behold and one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.",

    "text": "I love Guy and all his shows on the Food Network. When I saw that his restaurant was located at my hotel, I was salivating! I had recently saw he had a thing called the \"Trash Can Nachos.\"  I found them on the menu and was really excited to try them!  It was a disappointment for me....more show than good.  I also tried the veggie burger which was just ok. The bun to patty ration was way off and the patty fell apart if you touched it. So, I ate it deconstructed style. It did't have much flavor or spice. The fries that came with the burger, I did like.   I will say that I saw the Bloody Mary's that were served to a table next to us and they looked amazing! Actually, it could have been a complete meal with everything that's loaded on the celery stick! I wish I hadn't played so hard the night before, because I would have ordered that instead of coffee.  The servers were really good! Very nice and friendly, and noticed when your drinks were low! They get an A+. And we sat out in the patio area...it was a beautiful day, great weather and it's a fun location to people watch!  Later in the day, my stomach wasn't feeling so well and I think it was probably from the nachos.  Because I love Guy, I had to try it, but honestly, I wouldn't go there again.",

My wife, my daughter and I had the trash-can nachos for an appetizer. They were wonderful.  For the main course my wife had the O.G. Burger which she couldn't complain about. My daughter had a side order of Mac-n-cheese, she's only 5. I had the '68 hoagie with Frank's hot sauce on it. For dessert we had the fried ice cream. OMG it was so good. A high scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes.  Topped with whip cream, chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce and had a small side of peanut butter to top it all off.",

I would have liked the bacon crispier and the burger thicker instead of flatter but overall delicious. Comes w three types of fries mmmmm. Veggie burger is the best ever according to my partner. One question - why is the knife smaller than the fork?!?  And if guy is reading this.... how about diners drive ins and dives with debs.  I just want to spend one day eating w you.   Also I wish the napkins weren't $10 each or I would have bought some.",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place because I am a fan of Guy Fieri's show \"Diners, Drive ins, and dives\". The restaurant is pretty cool looking. It has an outdoor area and indoor area with a full bar. It was nice to be able to see the kitchen because it's wide open and let's you see how clean it is. I ordered the VIP margarita. It was delicious- a bit pricey for a margarita- but delicious nonetheless. The waitress was super friendly and attentive. I did notice that there is no restroom inside the restaurant. You have to leave the restaurant and use the restroom nearby inside a casino. I wanted wash my hands before eating since I was holding on to handrails on escalators all over the strip. My lunch consisted of the Mac and cheese bacon burger. It was HUGE! It is almost best to order one meal and split it amongst two people. One thing that I was too crazy about were the fries. They were just.....ok. I guess I expected more from Guy when it came to fries. I think I need to mention that the burger costed $21.50. I guess you get the value because of the size of the burger and the atmosphere, as well as, knowing Guy tastes it too! Overall, I recommend the restaurant. You will definitely NOT leave hungry.",

The fries were a mixture of shoestring, waffle, tatertots, and maybe a few other types. All of them were deep fried to perfection. Each bite was perfect. Think about it, all of these different fries would cook for different lengths of time. We after a show just when they were about to close and they sat us and the service was great. we were not neglected or rushed. Will be back!! :-)",

My meal was pretty decent but bbq sauce on the brisket wasn't woah.. The toast that came w/ it actually made me miss Texas.. That is REAL Texas toast not that freezer crap.. The burger eh it wasnt what we expected.. It wasn't bad but it wasnt mouth watering \"I need to eat more of it.\". The margaritas on the rocks are deelish!! Must have..

The service?  40 minute wait, 10 minutes to be greeted, God forbid we get drunk refills, and when we asked for the check despite nearly full plates of food and refused to-go containers she didn't even look surprised or bother to ask how the meal was.

    "text": "So I was hesitant about even coming here, but Hash House had an hour and a half wait for brunch on a Sunday. We show up at 10:30, thinking no problem we can get in by 11 for breakfast because there's no one there. I was wrong. The hostess forgot to put our name in so after checking back in at 11 and finally sat at 11:10 it was too late for breakfast. Ok, that was disappointing but we were hungry and really thought \"how bad could it be?\"   I will say, our server was awesome. He was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. He repeated our order back to us so we knew that we were getting the correct items.  Truffle fries were great! Honestly thought I haven't had truffle fries I haven't liked. That's about the best part. I order the General wings. They were cool in presentation and came with different items to dip them in. While the wings were big, the sauce was way way way too sweet. My friend got the buffalo wings, and they were eh. Neither wings were crispy, but the buffalo wings were definitely soggy. The blue cheese was great though! My boyfriend ordered the Motley Que sandwich. The fries were good, and the sandwich was ok. The meat tasted like liquid smoke had been added to it and tasted artificial.   Over all the service was great but the food was blah. I like Guy, but this is disappointing. Head over to the Yard House just a few steps away for better food and pricing!",

Don't get me wrong this is still an American bar food/touristy type of place and I wont be swapping a dinner at Jaleo for a dinner here any time soon but it was perfect for the occasion. We were in the mood to drink and nosh on some basic food, this fit the bill.  Our biggest complaint was that the wait took forever, it was a little bit chilly and we didn't have coats on so we had to wait for an inside table and there aren't a ton of them.  We were there on a Friday night, they had good deals on fireball shots and pitchers of beer, this started checking our boxes right away. In addition to lots of booze we got the brisket nachos and the mac and cheese burger. The portion sizes are huge, these two dishes were perfect to be split between three people, we all left very full. The nachos were delicious I would recommend them for sure.  Also, if you have your Total Rewards casino card with you it saves $1/dish, don't forget it in the room like we did...",

    "text": "What can I say other than omg, I had the turkey burger which was absolutely amazing, super tasty, really filling, just generally super.  My husband had the nachos which he thoroughly enjoyed, they had brisket and a delicious bbq sauce  I had fries with my burger which were nice as they were different varieties e.g skinny fries, crinkle cut fries etc.    I like the decor and atmosphere here, we were seated outside which was great for a warm Vegas evening.  My negatives however, firstly there were a tonne of people waiting to be seated despite the fact there were lots of empty tables.  The music was horrendously loud to the point where my husband and I couldn't hear ourselves to have a conversation....what is it with this as it seems to be a common thing here in Vegas?    The biggest negative for me was the stupid wooden tray/plate that the food was served on.  I think that anything wooden in the kitchen can be quite unhygienic (we've all heard of  chopping boards harbouring bacteria) but they also line the wooden plate with paper which eventually softens from the juice in the meat and I ended up with several mouthfuls of goopy paper where is had stuck to my food, not a pleasant sensation for me nor for anyone noticing me digging it out of my mouth!!!!  Overall I really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back if I am in town again some day.",

This place had only been opened couple weeks when i went and was overpacked.  From the moment you walk in, you see Guy's portrait and books to remind you of where you are.  But it's the little touches that makes this place unique.  Napkins themed with spanish Dia de Muertos art to big wooden clipboard menus.  It's different with a unique touch of style  The food is out of bounds as you might expect.  Big burgers to giant onion rings served on a metal pipe rack.  The cocktails did not dissapoint and i suggest you try some of them.  The star of the night was their peperoni wrapped breadstick fondue.  I ordered their champion Mac n Cheese burger and it was huge!  burger was decent but the meat could have been seasoned better.  Finally we ended up sharing the recommended fried ice cream sundae, which is a masterpiece.    I will be returning to Guy's restaurant and that's saying alot since the choices are usually endless in Vegas.  The atmosphere is electirc and the staff is great.  I'm impressed with the new Linq area and this restaurnt surrounded by the Quad is a nice addition to the Vegas night life.",

He was pleasant and tried to make up for it, but only checked back once after our food was delivered. We were never offered additional drinks or refills, nor were we offered dessert. A busser delivered our check and we only saw our server when he dropped off slip to be signed. Overall, kind of bummed about the experience.",

I wouldn't get this again, though it wasn't bad. -Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger - Good burger!  The mac 'n cheese didn't make the burger to heavy, as I was worried about.  It actually tasted really good with the burger.  It was also not a huge as it looks in some people's pictures.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big burger and is a half pound but in some pictures, it looks just gigantic.  Came with three different types of fries - I liked the tiny shoestring ones the best.  Drinks were good.  My friend got the Kentucky Rock'r and liked it so much, she chose it for her second drink.   Guido's Freaky Tiki, which was both sweet and sour.  I thought it was okay - I enjoyed my second drink, the Java Guava, better.    I don't think I'd wait an hour to eat here, but I wouldn't mind trying out the wings or a different burger next time.",

Will definitely come back to try their Bacon Mac N Cheese burger, I mean can you really go wrong with that combo?   Their workers were really friendly and made an effort to talk to me (since I was alone at the bar). The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of their fries. I don't know why they give you \"quad fries\" there's just some ways I don't like my fries to be. They're all different and more than half were stale so I couldn't even eat them.",

The Mac and cheese burger was just delicious. Juicy marriage of flavors. Absolutely something you come up with after some alcohol.  I don't know where this combination came out of but is in one word perfect.   We shared our burgers so we were able to order the pastrami burger. If the Mac and cheese was perfect then the pastrami one was absolutely perfect. I'm from NY so I love me some pastrami. All of the stuff on it combined with a pretzel bun. Again the taste buds go crazy. Like what's happening here.  Now add to all this the quad fries and it makes it one of the best dinning experiences I've encountered.   The reason I'm giving it 4 not a 5 is the service. It had a lot to be desired. Took forever to get drinks and even longer to get our bill and our credit card back. She was gone for a good 15 minutes with my card. This is unsettling really.   Food great, service needs help and attention.",

The area next to the hostess table had a lot of Guy's merchandise, from books to shirts, so there is something for everyone from hardcore Guy fans to those who just want a souvenir. There is seating inside, outside, and at the bar. The seating outside is okay, since you can people watch. But even with the misters, it was too hot and the view is just of the entrance of the LINQ and Harrahs. While waiting, they have some Guy memorabilia, like his UNLV chef coat, to view and the kitchen is open so you can see the burgers coming out.  We ended up sitting near the windows. I loved that the windows added natural light and allowed you to see the strip. I liked the decor from the napkins to the menu clipboards and tables, it was very Guy-esque.   The food was very delicious and surprisingly filling. Each burger comes with a mixture of waffle fries, shoestring fries, and crinkle cut fries with seasoning. I got the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger and I LOOOVED it!! It's the best turkey burger I've ever had. It was so tasty and everything in and on the burger complimented one another. I tried some of my brother's Off-Da-Hook Original Smash burger and it was also super delicious.  Service was great. We were greeted right away upon arriving. Our waiter was nice and attentive. Bonus, our food came out right away after ordering. FYI, there is no restroom in the restaurant, but outside in the LINQ to the right when you exit.   Overall, I recommend coming here because as Guy would say, \"It's off the chain!\"",

What was weird was that the restaurant had so many open tables.   I split the original ringer burger with my sister. It was pretty big and delicious. It comes with fries. We decided to share the Dragons Breath Chili Cheese Fries. It was huge!  The 4 of us couldn't finish it!  It was really good too.  Lots of cheese and chili. I would recommend both the burger and fries.   Our server was really nice and the food came out fast. If you're a total rewards member, you get like a dollar off of the menu items.

And having bacon, fried onion strings, AND MAC N CHEESE on the burger with LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles) is just food heaven.

I was really excited to try this restaurant out as it was in our Hotel we were staying at, shout out to the Linq and always seeing videos of the Mac and Cheese burger. Our wait was a little longer than expected, our fault for going at the end of lunch rush but I was able to kill time at the blackjack table.   When we were finally seated we were welcomed with a good ol' Taylor Swift blasting over the speakers. Haha Vegas, okay. The menu was pretty pricey but again... Haha Vegas, okay. I ended up going with my fat kid self and got the mac and cheese burger. OMFG that thing was so SALTY - it was saltier than me... Of course it being so salty I was super thirsty and our waitress never stopped by the table to refill our waters until after we got the bill, even tried to wave her down a few times. The food was okay, not the best and our service S-U-C-K-E-D.  Overall, make sure you're hydrated and definitely try the fries. Those were the highlight of the visit...   ALSO, I love my girl Taylor Swift, but hearing her 4 times during our visit is much. LOL.   Tasty Tip: Go to McDonalds, at least you'll get an emoji pillow in your happy meal.",

My pulled pork had way too much mayo and Drew's sand which was so salty from the sausage and the sauce he couldn't finish it.   I will say, the potatoes we had were AMAZING, beer selection and service saved this place for me.    I would probably skip lunch and just do happy hour here.  Finally, the hostess was the singularly most unhappy person we met in Vegas. Not a crack or hint of a smile. She obviously hates her job and no one will call her out on it.  If you're in a service industry you better learn to fake some kind of interest. I watched her while we were there walk everyone to their table, slap down menus, and walk away without even so much as \"enjoy\".  Bad impression from the get go in a place like this.  I commented on this in the survey you complete with the meal.  That was a month ago, I never heard anything.",

FOOD:  The Mayor of Flavortown $19 Seasoned Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, Caraway Seed Slaw, Dill Pickles, Onion Straws, Dijon Mustard on Garlic Buttered Pretzel Bun.  At first, I thought it was only going to be pastrami meat only, but it was actually a burger patty WITH pastrami on top. The burger patty was tender. The pastrami had quality but was a bit dry. Their slaw is not too over powering. The onion straws were crunchy. The bun itself was soft and flavorful. Very meaty burger and was tasty but very heavy. Its that type of food that will put you in a food coma.  Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger $20 Crispy Applewood Bacon, Six-Cheese Mac n' Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickle, Cheese and Donkey Sauce on Garlic Buttered Brioche Bun.  This is their most popular burger. Its your basic burger with a slight twist. The bacon is cooked to perfection. There is a light serving of mac n cheese in between, not smothered. Everything went well together and was good.   Quad Fries  Served as a side with each burger. These fries are really unique because it is a pile made of fat crinkle fries, skinny string fries, mini waffle fries, and mini wedge fries. I think that it is a great and creative combination. And yes, they were delicious.  Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries $16 Yes, we had more fries! This was a mountain of waffle fries covered in chili and topped with melted cheddar, pico de gallo, sour cream, and scallions. This was one of the best appetizers ever ! Everything complimented the fries so well. The fries were crispy. And everything else was melting goodness. Try not to eat so much before your actual meal comes out! Its quite a big portion! I would say it is large enough to share between 2-4 people.  Overall, everything here is good. It's just really heavy in terms of putting you in a food coma type of heavy. I just wish they had more options here instead of just burgers and the basics (salad, fries, etc.)",

My husband had the Mac & Cheese Burger and there was a light spread of Mac and cheese like 4 pieces of Mac. 1/2 way through my meal I had no water to drink and we didn't see our  waitress anywhere. We are waitress was nowhere to be seen for over 15miI got up out of my seat and just walked around the restaurant to find her to get my check. I would consider my experience a mediocre experience. The only thing I can  Rave about were the ribs! Our total meal was almost $300. Not worth the money!",

I liked the decor, it was western trendy, and it felt like Guy's style. His recipe books and sauces  are on sale at entrance.   I was expecting the food to be really good considering he's such a famous Tv chef. I ordered the mac and cheese burger, I love macaroni and cheese and so I was really expecting for a great tasting cheesy macaroni and cheese!! I was fairly disappointed in the burger,  the mac & cheese was not very cheesy, the  burger was not juicy!!  Overall it tases like a regular burger from any other joint, I didn't finish it and I didn't care to take it back to my hotel ( I always want to take food back!!)    The fries were okay, I did like that your fries was a mixture of curly, string shoe, and regular fries. My fiance ordered a chicken pasta, I love pasta and even that tasted not chef worthy! It had a funky taste to it also fake or can sauce.   The desserts look amazing but honestly I was too scared to even try after being so disappointed with my meal.",

A peek into the kitchen reveals large heat lamps. Disappointing. We're local and won't return. While the menu offers a great selection of comfort food dishes, paying a premium for COLD food is not palatable. Server never stoped by to check on us after initial order. See pic of food under lamps. If you enjoy cold and limpy French fries and overpriced cold burgers, you'll enjoy Guy's restaurant by the Linq.   Ps. I'm a fan of triple D, love the show, while waiting I leafed through his cookbooks on display. They're significantly less $$ on Amazon.",

We sat down at the bar and had only been there a few minutes when one of your waitresses came out with some plates of food. A ramican of truffle oil fell off the plate, hit the ground, and perfectly hit me/my purse/my whole outfit. There was no coming back for my shirt.   I have to tell you Jason McIntosh your general manager is a True gem. He cleaned my purse for me, sent me off with new shirts from your gift shop, and recommended the BEST drink and appetizers that of course he took care of for me. Btw- those nachos are seriously the best and I don't even like nachos. Not just that but he gave me two of your signed napkins which I gave to my sister for her birthday and she was ecstatic. We may or may not binge watch diners, drive ins and dives... and your grocery games.   And guess what- the next night, We saw you at Caesar's and you took a picture with my sister without even knowing who we were. I'm so glad the whole staff is a class act.   Your food is amazing and your staff knows True customer service and has character. For anyone who is looking for top notch service with top notch food- I highly recommend. Thank you especially to Jason- you made a bad situation into one of the most memorable from the weekend.",

There was a short line outside but inside it was pretty empty.   Food: We ordered wings and a burrito. Both were just ok. I have had much better wings, and the Burrito was a lot of food with zero taste.   Service: It was fairly slow for an empty-ish restaurant. We couldn't finish our food because we had to be somewhere.   Price: Two words - over priced!

There's a certain level of chaos to be expected when you're dining anywhere on The Strip, and that chaos was certainly present when we approached the hostess stand. We decided to bypass that whole situation (because we're dining pros) & head to the outdoor high-top bar where it appeared to be first come, first serve (whether it actually was or not, we still have no idea). The whole experience felt very 'chain restaurant', but the burger was reaaaaaaaaaaally good. If you want to drop $20+ on a cheeseburger, this is definitely the place for you.",

I've had better tacos from a food truck. The dirty rice lacked flavor. I ordered lobster tacos and then was brought back \"Lobster Lollipops\". I told the waitress and she made it seem like it was my mistake when I initially pointed the item on the menu as well and knew what I was ordering from what section. She then took it away so I had to wait another X amount of minutes on top of already waiting when the wrong plate. Then as we were getting our checks, she asked us if we wanted it on one check or do separate but she still came back and had it on ONE check. She didn't even give us a pen to sign with. I wouldn't come back here at all. Service needs improvement and the menu needs to be tweaked and add more variety and prices. Makes you feel like they force you to purchase the expensive mediocre meals.",

I had the staple, which was burgers and fries...There was nothing special about the presentation. The cocktails were lit though!  The waitress was super sweet and the bartender really packed a punch with those long islands. The over all experience was cool!",

They were not only overdone but I had difficulty telling the difference between the meat and the bone. A steak knife could not cut through the charred and overdone meat. When I told the server about this, he came back from the chef with a message that sometimes the meat was smoked too long and overdone. No apology. That's just the way it was. Any chef with any sort of pride in his work would never send out burned meat and make a lame excuse for it. I hope that Guy Fieri would be embarrassed that this meal had come from his kitchen. If you go there, stay away from the ribs. The service was very good but I won't return.",

We had a party of 8 and could not get out quick enough. The ribs where covered with sauce so thick you had to ask for an extra knife just to scrape it off, the caesars salad... a top a soggy crouton... was drenched in garlic so bad you had to remember it was a caesar salad, the pulled pork on a stale pretzel roll dismissal and the chili fries dumped in a soup bowl un-eatable. This is a real black-eye for the TV franchise, but after New York and the closing of Johnny Garlic's, it may just be a warning to us all that what you see on TV does not always translate to everyday living. Oh I did fail to mention that the simple hamburger they made for my 9 year old guest was well prepared, just a bun, meat, cheese, so not everything about our visit was a loss.",

But I gave 1 star because the waitress that served us had an attitude & that was disappointing to be treated like that on Father's Day (yes I'm doing my review late but I still have a fresh memory of my experience). The 1 star is for effort!! Thank you for putting effort into the \"deep fried ice cream\" which didn't seem deep fried AT ALL!! It looked like they just scooped Ice cream on to a plate and sprinkled frosted flakes onto the ice cream & decorated it with strawberries & other toppings. I really expected more out of my visit because they made us wait so long to be seated when they were seating other customers with 5 people in there party, they made us wait about an hour & 30 mins. I would not recommend this place to my family & friends.",

We were seated right away and our waitress was on point! We ordered nachos as an appetizer, and it was so good, there was cheese and toppings on every chip! I had the chicken tacos, and they were the BEST chicken tacos I have ever had, my grandpa and great-grandma shared a shredded prime rib sandwich that they are STILL talking about, my grandma had the \"French fry\" tacos and they were delicious! Definitely a good vegetarian dish! Chef Tony himself came out to make sure everything was great! Dessert was INCREDIBLE! They are all HUGE! One dessert will feed a whole table! We got literally a half a cheesecake, that was delicious, a GALLON of mint chocolate chip ice cream covered I Oreos and not fudge, and some Churros, and ended up taking ALL of out leftovers home.  If you like Guy Ferei and know his style, this place it perfect! I will be going back many times!",

The atmosphere was cool; we sat outside on the patio to listen to the music in the surrounding area/casino. Our server looked like he did not want to be there and was not pleasant. The Mac + Cheese Bacon burger was huge and pretty good. My husband's Triple B Burger was over seasoned, leaving a bad taste. All our fries with our meals were all too salty - over seasoned!  Even both our kids, who love fries, didn't like it or want any. The  Double Barrel BBQ wings were ok, nothing to brag about. Our server never checked on us during the meal, then all of a sudden, another server was asking if we wanted dessert. We kindly declined and asked for the bill. When we got it, some of the billing/charges were incorrect. If you have a \"Total Rewards\" players card, each of the meal prices should be discounted. This had not been the case,  only two items were discounted; the new server blamed our first server since he entered our order on the system/computer. Please review your itemize receipt before paying. They fixed the bill after we addressed it to the server, but if we didn't review it, then we would have paid more.",

His nyc disaster opening in furthered my distaste for him. After eating at his restaurant I do think he is a legit restaurateur.  The food was fantastic. Our waitstaff was super pleasant. We had the turkey picnic, Mac and cheese burger, and lettuce wraps. The lettuce wrap stuffing and sauces were awesome. Spring rolls were crispy and delicate yet bumped up by the sauces. The turkey sandwich was raved by our friends. The pretzel roll was amazing!  Turkey well cooked. The burger was definitely a signature burger and super tasty. The Mac and cheese can be flavorless (Cheesecake Factory) but this one actually added a nice cheese sauce and extra carbs to the burger. No need for ketchup for us as the sauce on there was plenty. The fries were fantastic and a mix of different kinds. The locked up spicy ketchup was a perfect complement for the fries. Overall great place. Food came out slowly. We anted breakfast and just missed it ( I guess 10:30 or 11?).  Since when did guy allow breakfast?  Our campus vision wasn't allowed to do breakfast but this place had it. Our neighbors had some awesome French toast. Maybe a brunch option for weekend would be good.",

They should remove those off their menu for sure or find a new way to prepare them. Also had the burger with the onion ring on it ( i forgrt the exact name) it was ok but I have for dure had better. Once again wasnt impressed. The service was good, no complaints there which is the only reason I gave it two stars otherwise I would have easily given only 1 star. They ended up taking off the chili fries from my bill because I took 3 bites and couldnt eat it so they took it off for me. That was nice of them considering I would rather not pay for something that was gross and I couldnt eat them. Considering this restaurant is in the main area for Carnival court and between the Linq and Harrahs I am very surprised it wasnt better. You would think they would only allow the best to be in that kind of location. Its a New place so who knows maybe it just wont last. I for sure wont be going back and also wont recommend it to anyone. Maybe if you just aant a few drinks and to sit at the bar it would be worth it.",

After that, out come the apps, only part of the meal I can't say was disgusting(the rojo rings were a lil sweet for my taste but hey someone else could love them), then came the worst part, the entrees. My wife had the Mac and cheese burger, over cooled(I assume my mom got the same kinda charred cow dung patty, I just didn't taste it.) Then my meal....oh brother, the Big Dipper. I was told oh our BBQ is really good you'll love it being from Texas. I must admit that I have a soft spot for BBQ. Told me it was slow smoked. No...you just doused it in liquid smoke. Disgusting. And French fries? Ha ha ha ha. Never had French fries I thought I would break my teeth on. And after this they had the audacity to bring me a 300 dollar check. Wait staff was great though, so there's that, I'd advise them to go work at a real restaurant, because this place will go down in flames at some point when people are tired of getting ripped off for horrible food.

We figured we get a couple appetizer since we would b getting to the airport early and thought we would eat there which turned out awful since they have NO restaurant in the airport . So back to the bad service and terrible food  we got the bbq nachos and wing both we average at best . For someone who goes all over tasting to best food u think he would pick up some tips on what good food is because this is far from good .if you want a good mesl go to the yard house great food and reasonable priced skip this place shame on him",

    "text": "I am writing this review on behalf of my 4 girlfriends and myself. I'm not posting with the intent to embarass  the restaurant or Guy Fieri himself, however, I must say we were pretty dissappointed in probably the most popular item on the menu... The trash nachos... As virgins to Vegas and might I add foodies, we researched food and drink menus up and down the strip. After we found the video of the famous trash nachos, for weeks we drooled over the anticipation of them. We finally get to our hotel The Linq and decide to take a dive into this mountain of nacho chaos and as they came to the table we were all a little ... Okay very dissappointed in the presentation and quantity of this plate . For one... Okay $20 for nachos , you're in Vegas and at a famous chefs restaurant so fine we can get over the price, however, coming out with a bucket that is barely to if even HALF full and barely smothered with toppings when ... On the video where y'all promoted this plate it was a completely full gooey mess ... Was a huge disappointment . Guy Fieri, if for some reason you decide to browse through yelp and read this comment, please note that I am not tryin to criticize you or your menu however as a chef and foodie yourself you need to know that your False advertisement of this bucket is cheating people out of their time and money and for a foodie I feel as if that's a cardinal sin. I understand you using your reputation to make profit in one of the busiest cities in America as you should but hold up to your reputation and deliever what people expect at the place such as yours.  Other than that .. the food was fine.",

Once we finally got seated the environment was very loud and hectic. It was hard to hear the rest if our party without yelling back and forth. The menu was very small and everything was very pricey for the quality of food they were serving. I ordered the Mac and cheese burger and expected a lot of flavor, all I got was a mediocre burger that had some flavorless macaroni on top of it. My wife ordered the street tacos and for $20 they brought out a few tiny tacos that didn't compare to a local taco shop that would give you 20 of them that were bigger, better, and full of flavor for the same price.  Definitely another tourist trap with a celebrity name on it like many of the other ones on the strip.  Won't be returning here sadly, but I'm sure many will ignore this review and try out the waters for themselves.",

Our wait staff which consisted of 3 people (2) of them had a bad attitude the 3rd waitress was amazingly sweet and genuinely very kind ( we were told her name was Kayla ;-)....I ordered the General Wings ( the first waitress we had rushed through what the \"3\" containers of crumbs that come with chicken were...I also ordered the Quad fries (very good) comes with 3 different dipping sauces (the 2nd waiter didn't really explain what those were) the white ranch tasting sauce was the best in my opinion. My companion ordered the  Macaroni burger he said it was great...I took a small bite (it was good). Overall, we would return to Guy's there are more items on the menu we would like to try.  Hopefully,  the 2nd time around we wont get bad, I don't really want to be at work service. The customer service/hospitality at Guy's was NOT at all what I would expect on the infamous strip  If you don't like the work you're doing QUIT!",

We got seated quickly and after a couple minutes we were brought water and offered drinks.   Service throughout was very good all the staff was all very friendly. everyone helped stopped by asked what we needed.  We ordered the cheese fries which were amazing crispy waffle fries with chili pico cheese sour cream awesome.  I had the Mac and cheeseburger and my wife had the triple d which after the fries was a lot of food.  Burgers were very good if say probably a 4 i have had a few places that were better but definitely would come back.  Louis waited on us he did a great job interacting with us and made the lunch enjoyable.  Try it and enjoy!",

The waiter was HORRIBLE   Apparently there were drink specials and he never told us about them. We overheard from another waiter about them. We orders the won tacos the flavors in this did not go together. I had the wings. WORST WINGS EVER!!!!  My friend had the pastrami sandwich with fries. Fries came with three different types. Crinkle, shoestring and waffle. The seasoning on them was so strange. I was trying to decider what the seasoning was and said it taste like confectioners sugar. I asked the more knowledgable waiter and sure enough powdered sugar was one if the seasoning. Who ever heard if this??!  The food portions are humongous. No one needs sandwiches that big. We were very disappointed since we thought the food would be \"KILLER\"   I think Guy needs to steal some recipes from the places he visits on triple D. JUST SAYIN!!!",

    "text": "Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!",

The burgers we had both needed just a little more taste to them (adding ketchup helped a lot).  The fries were the highlight, cut in different cuts, had a nice spice.  The service was lacking though.  Took awhile for server to first come.  The food came out quickly but we had asked for more ketchup, it never came and we were never offered refills on our water.  After leaving the restaurant, we had to go back into the restaurant, and a waitress saw us coming up to the door, we thought she would hold it but she quickly darted in front of us, opened it enough for herself and kept going.  The staff need better service to their customers in a few ways.  I wouldn't rush back.",

We started with truffle fries (not the best I've had but I loved the cut of the fry) and the pepperoni wrapped pretzel sticks with a provolone, basil, tomato and Italian sausage fondue. This is where I start cursing about the deliciousness. I could eat those pretzel sticks and that dip, all day long. We saved the remainder of the dip and added it to our entrees. I had the Motley Que (pulled pork sandwich) and the smoke and bark on it was just perfect. I handed it around the table for bites and I'm confident when I say it was the best order choice. Now the service was a bit iffy - our waitress was nice, not overly quick on the uptake and was telling us stories about vomiting on Fremont Street. We had to wait a bit too long for water refills and she forgot beers etc. But overall the experience was worth it.",

The wait to get into the restaurant was not long, but complicated by staff giving out the same tables.  Once seated, we waited about 10 minutes to get water, etc.  My guy ordered a light beer, but was given the wrong beer.  Once, he explained to the waiter that he had the wrong beer the problem began.  The waiter felt compelled to tell my guy that he was a beer connoisseur as he smelled his beer.  This really appalled us.  The waiter found out that it was indeed the wrong beer!  Apologies later, nothing comped, we ended up waiting over an hour for simple plates of food.  We observed other diners arrive and leave as we waited.  The manager did not stop at our table during our visit and couldn't be found.  I did not leave a tip; only a bad review.",

Two in the party ordered a Greek salad for $15.50 and a side piece of bread ($5) the salad came and was just two pieces of romaine lettuce and a quarter piece of tomato. The menu said it comes with hummus and we were so disappointed when it came with an amount that was smaller than a teaspoon. When we asked about it and even spoke to the manager, they both had the same robotic answer \"that's the way Guy Fieri chooses to serve at his restaurant. It's not our name on the building\" we were so disappointed and will never be back!",

The food was basic overcharge forVegas, meaning 23$ for a 12$ sandwich. Problem was, nothing on the menu was  special or that tasty. The nachos made me sick and the bbq sauce was worse than I made on my first try at home...  2 stars for the drinks dont bother with the food though",

We got the trash can nachos and they were ok, besides the sauce on the brisket. Waaaay too sweet. For sure not worth $20. The Mac and cheese burger was not ooey gooey cheesey like advertised. I've had better from other restaurants. Mac and cheese seemed like it had been sitting for a while. We also ordered the blackened chicken pasta. The flavor was decent but in no way was this blackened chicken. Can get this same dish at Chili's for less than Guy's $39. All in all, I probably won't return here :/",

It is cool to say I went to but out of all the other places I went to on the strip this would be the one I would pass on. First, we had the trash can nachos yeah its cool and looks good but honestly, it's just a show thing and actually had better nachos at nacho daddy down the street off of Miracle Mile. Then I and my lady split the Mac & Cheese Burger and had two lemonades to drink. Our bill with tip was over 60 dollars that I am sorry is outrageous. The burger was nothing to write home about and 4.00 dollars for a soft drink is silly. What looked the best and we didn't even get was the bloody mary but once again the overpriced menu of this place would have had us up to 80 or 100 dollars for two people at a burger joint is ridiculous not only that but they want to charge you for napkins 4 for 10. Thanks but no thanks Guy I will take my business to Bobby flays, or Walhburgers, or Gordon Ramseys for something high priced",

When the food came out it was mediocre. I ordered the carne Asada chile something (don't remember). It was basically breakfast nachos. They were okay but the chips were extremely soggy,  and more on the bland side. Definitely not anything to rave about. They seemed like they had been sitting for a while. My friend had the bacon biscuit egg sausage meal which seemed okay. He said the biscuit was not very tasty.   Probably wouldn't come back to this place although it seems as though whatever everyone else around us ordered looked great. No idea about the taste.",

Guy's cheese cake challenge.   To die for!    Upon leaving, I messed up and left a bag of souvenirs hooked under the table.   However I didn't realized this until returning home to Houston while unpacking ... three days later!  By chance, I called the restaurant Sunday morning and they still had my bag of souvenirs!!    The manager, Andrea, and staff were very helpful and luckily there was still family in the area who were able to retrieve my goodies.  A big thank you for all their help!

Service at the bar was prompt & attentive. Friendly bartender. Service at the table admittedly was slow and not nearly as attentive especially during a slower time.  However, I LOVE the apps here ~ the Sashimi Won-Tacos, Fondue Dippers, and Asian Chicken Wraps are DELICIOUS and perfectly portioned for those who like Ahi & asian inspired foods and unusual apps (fondue dipper). We visited twice just for these dishes. LOVE the ambiance, location, & people watching too.",

So my food is here my hubby ordered the Mac n cheese burger and brisket nachos too late for me so I shared with him.  The nachos had an excellent flavor fresh tortilla chips, and beef brisket. Only thing is some of the pieces of brisket were over cooked and dry, because they are nachos you have all of these flavors disguising the most important thing the meat. They weren't terrible, just a few pieces were dry and tough. But the sauce amazing I guess that's why he's packaged it. Now this burger was a whopper elbow macaroni, bacon, crispy fried onion rings. Excellent flavor, taste like it was cooked on a barbecue grill. Really great flavor, so overall not bad. Would go back",

As we sat down we got some food orders in and we got some drinks on the way with during happy hour. A burger and a beer for twenty bucks. We were very amazed by the taste of the burgers as they had a lot of flavor. We have spent three days in Vegas and this is one of our last food destinations. We met some cool people and had some good food. Definitely a high recommendation. Thanks Guy's team and Mercedes!!",

They used to be brought out on an oval plate, and steamed off their deliciousness, but now they are brought out in a chimney starter. This seems interesting, until the server removes the starter, and your nachos spread out on the plate like a fat guy at the beach. Flavor wise the nachos were good, especially the chips, but as I said before the brisket was just a sprinkling.  Besides the nachos, we had the sashimi won-tacos. They were four little crispy tacos of sashimi mixed with a tangy coating. They came with lime wedges and radishes. The tacos were good, but nothing special.  Overall, the food was good, and there is a lot to choose from. Just know that you will get average food with good flavor...if that makes sense.",

Oozy cheese pasta on top of a beef patty cooked perfected with crispy edges but juicy inside. The fries were a combination of waffles, shoestring, crinkles, and wedges. There was a seasoning on the fries that wasn't overwhelming but perfect. Honestly my favorite burger I've ever had. It was pretty big so my friend and I shared it! Will come back when in Vegas!",

Motley Que was mine and loaded with pork, great slaw and on a nice soft pretzel roll. Loved it. Would try the turkey burger next time to get into the poblanos.

We ordered hot and spicy chicken wings and full rack of ribs & side of Mac and cheese. Presentation is quite impressive and very unique & creative. Chicken wings were delicious and cooked well. Had sweet and spicy sauce and topped with sliced hot peppers. Also have three little things you can dip, crushed peanuts, wasabi crumbs and delicious cheese bread crumbs which was my favorite. Ribs were good but kind of dried for my liking and wasn't a fan of their bbq sauce as much. Side order of Mac and cheese was delicious. Has a bit of spice and crumbs on top and nothing bad to say about it whatsoever. The venue is really nice, very clean, modern and industrial. Certainly unique and will catch your eyes when you walk in and sit down. Portion was more than expected and price is reasons for where it is. I would def like to come back to try different entrees on the menu.",

I never expect these places to be good. Any namesake restaurant usually falls flat. So we pass it up. In the morning we want breakfast/brunch so we laughingly come here because of the hoopla the night before.   Not only was the place good but it was great. They killed it. The bartenders were hilarious and helpful and put up with our sassy friend. We met some other vacationers and it was the perfect launching point for the day. Most everyone bit on the steak breakfast and it was fun that they served it with a watermelon gazpacho. The gazpacho was so good that my friend turned it into a 55oz mimosa. It was amazing!!!! The bartenders charged our buddy's phone and before giving it back took a bunch of hilarious pictures.  You should def go here to start your day off because everyone will make you smile and the food is very reasonable and delicious.",

My mom had taken me there for my birthday back in September, 2014.  We had the best experience the other night...The best manager that I have ever met (Tim) made us feel very special.  The only thing that would have made either / both experiences better was if we were able to meet Guy Fieri himself.  Thank you very much Guy for opening this restaurant.  Also, we loved all of our drinks!!!!  Love the German Chocolate Cake... Keep cooking!!!!!!!!",

I had the Triple B burger and Greek salad.  I probably won't return anytime soon.",

Cons: waitress was friendly, but slow, the music was so loud my friends and I couldn't talk across the table we literally had to whisper in each other ear. On top of that we had this obnoxious drunk guy behind us trying to talk but he's screaming because of the loud music. At that point, I was ready to take my food and go. Wait time 25 mins in line and this was on a Thursday night. Super crowded. I would come back, but I would want my food to go next time.   We were also the only black people in the restaurant, received great service it was kind of awkward, but I didn't give a damn.",

Its like an jazzed up red robin lol. Tbh dinners drive ins and dives has mislead me before so I guess I should have expected it. Honestly most of these food network guys have underwhelming restaurants that don't live up to the hype. Especially for the price but it is the strip after all. Mario Batalli's place was ok though .",

This time the hostess was rude when we asked to eat on the patio and told us it would be a 30 min wait even though it was half empty outside. An hour in after watching several couples who put their name in after ours get seated, we inquired when our seat was available. They scrambled to add our ticket to the stack on the counter and tried to seat us inside.  When we reminded them that we wanted to eat outside they seemed frustrated. They hastily cleared a table and sat us. The experience made us feel forgotten and uncared for, which made for a sad start to dinner.",

Get ours and the people next to us sit down and order theirs. Aka they got the goods... Bacon... Sausage... Etc. so at this point we ask why we didn't get it ?? No one can answer that. I mean seriously. Finally we get bacon after 20 min and another 20 min get a sausage. At this point no more bloody Mary's. An hr later we are still waiting for our nachos and burger after everyone else at the bar who came after us already ate and paid for theirs. FINALLY we get out food and they dump the nachos on the table and walk away. I mean come on. How hard is to put nachos on a table with out spilling everywhere.

    "text": "FRIES ARE A MUST HAVE.   This is my second time dining here and each time, the fries were the highlight of my meal. (Truffle fries are the best!) I always order their Caesar salad as it's the only vegetarian friendly meal they offer. It's a really savory salad that comes in great proportions! I really dislike that giant crouton it comes with, though. It looks like a bread bowl that takes up almost half the plate and is INCREDIBLY hard, basically a rock. I shouldn't need a steak knife to eat my salad. Trying to cut pieces off that giant crouton is a task making it feel as if it's not meant to be eaten. However, I don't expect to eat the best salad at Guy Fieri's restaurant LOL.  Their Bloody Mary's are awesome! You get to choose on a level of 1-5 how spicy you want yours to be, though be advised they tend to run on the spicier side. I ordered a 2 which is supposed to be lightly spicy but was rather a medium level of spicy. Still super good! Its garnish for dinner time consists of a generous sized stalk of celery accompanied with a raspberry, a cherry, a few olives & jalapenos.  Though I haven't tried them myself, my friends love to order the burgers here which come in huge proportions and make the best pre-drinking meal. From my experience, the burgers seem to be the best thing here as my friends have me coming back here just for the burgers. Considering Vegas' overpriced food theme, these burgers are definitely worth it just from their size alone!",

We wanted to order items that we've seen on the show:  -Husband ordered the sashimi tuna tacos and the fireball whiskey hot wings. No flavor!!! The wings tasted like plain ass wings I could buy frozen from the store and bake but these were worse as they were so over baked, ended up very chewy. The tuna, omg, a crime to waste tuna on this flavorless dish. When I saw the episode where they made those tacos, I couldn't wait to try them. The way they marinaded the fish, and all the flavors, it was supposed to be a party in my mouth!!! -I ordered the Triple B burger just cuz I love bleu cheese. What a disappointment :( couldn't detect the cheese and the patty literally just tasted like plain old beef- no seasoning, no salt, and very very very over-cooked. I asked for medium rare. At this point, we were pretty hungry and the place was jam packed (around 3pm) so we just wanted to get out asap. And we didn't mention anything to the wait staff. Personally, if Guy Fieri wanted to start up his own restaurant business, make time to check in with your restaurants often. It's not the kitchens fault, or even if it is, if Guy stayed on top of it, the food wouldn't suck so bad. I wanted to message Guy personally but who knows if he'd ever be the one to read the review. All in all, very disappointed & I'll never waste a penny at any of his restaurants again. First impression is everything.",

I was disappointed because Guy has such a flare for flavor on his TV show & his restaurant didn't stand to my expectations nor fit the price, & especially the wait time.  We ordered at 2:14 & didn't get the food till 2:53... Once finished eating waiter (Daniel) swung by to see if we would like dessert & I kindly said no thank you. He put the check down hard as our table moved & silverware clanked & walked off to socialize with another table. Glad I had cash! I gave him a few dollars for a tip although it wasn't deserved!",

    "text": "Decided to stop and try out Guy Fieri's after exploring the LinQ Promenade. Overall great vibe in the restaurant. At first our server greeted us and told us he'll give us a few minutes to decide on what to drink, after we told him that we needed waters all around. Took a good 5-8 minutes to get it. He stopped by after we received our waters and said he'll be right back to take our order. 15 minutes go and still have not ordered. Once we ordered, food came out pretty quickly in about 8-10 minutes. More than halfway through our meal, pops in our server to finally check on us, and had to ask for water refills. 5 minutes go past, and manager approaches us asking how everything was. We told him that we were still waiting for our water to be refilled. Finally refilled. When finished with our meals, we needed to-go boxes, and another 10 minutes of waiting for our server to finally ask for the boxes. I think the manager said something to the server to be more attentive, because attentiveness was barely there until after the manager stopped by. Food was very tasty. Had the pulled pork, general wings, and two almost bland burgers. A bit hard to eat on these warped wooden planks, but cool presentation. 4 stars for food. 1 star for server attentiveness.  3 stars overall. Server may have been overwhelmed, and forgot about some of his tables.  I know it happens. Probably would go elsewhere next time. Too many other restaurants, that would not miss this simple step of service.",

I love his shows on the Food Network and I have been for the longest time, but unfortunately this meal did not do it for me. I tried the sashimi tacos, takeout salad, buffalo fries, but the only thing that passed good/mediocre was the salad. Coming from such a popular chef I guess I came in with very high expectations. Sorry Guy*  RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Takeout salad - Creative setting, okay good (3.5) 2. Sashimi Tacos - Too gamey fishy taste, garlic was too overpowering, mango did not complement the tuna. (0/5) 3. Buffalo Fries - mediocre, good vegetarian option. (3/5)",

The flavor was delicious and the meat practically melted in my mouth. I am only giving 3 stars because the service was terrible. It took about 10 minutes to even have someone take my drink order. The place was about 2/3 full so there really isn't a good reason for that.  When the server brought the food, they forgot to bring one of the things I asked for. No problem, I figured the waiter would come be to check to see if everything came out ok. He never came by. Not until the very end.  I expected better and ended up disappointed. I should have sat in Amanda's section next to me. She was super cute and seemed highly efficient with all of her tables.  I will probably give this place another chance on my trip back to Vegas next year because the food was really good.",

Dragon's Breath Chili Cornbread Benedict - sweet cornbread topped with Dragon's Breath Chili, house white cheddar cheese sauce, scallions & two soft poached eggs.  Shortbread Pancake & Berry \"Pot Pie\" -vanilla shortbread pancakes stuffed with a mixed berry compote & whipped cream.  Maple Bacon French Toast -house baked brioche soaked in maple syrup custard & griddled in brown butter topped with dark maple syrup, candied bacon & bruleed banana  S'mores Monte Cristo -brioche, graham cracker butter, marshmallow & chocolate with chocolate & raspberry dipping sauces  In a city where the next big thing is always a week or two away and the majority of local 'critics' are essentially writing fluff-pieces based on comped meals arranged by the folks in marketing at major casinos I knew I needed to wait a while before visiting Guy Fieri's Las Vegas Kitchen & Bar and with a new brunch menu launched on August 1st without a whole lot of hype the time finally seemed right, myself and two others sitting down for four of Chef Leitera's newest creations plus one of Fieri's outlandish desserts just after 10:00am on Saturday with the restaurant just under 3/4 filled.  Not particularly a fan of the spiky haired celebrity but able to appreciate his place in pop-culture it was with an open mind that I approached the doors of the Linq-side locale and greeted by a hostess plus a surprising lack of 'branding' (compared to the likes of Ramsay, Puck, or even Batali) we were quickly led to a table, the service to follow effusively friendly and surprisingly efficient with questions she could not answer deferred to visits from the GM and chef himself.  Every bit the lively scene one would expect of a 'tatted-up' venue spilling from indoors to out yet far less loud than many thanks to high ceilings, reclaimed woods, and plenty of glass it was with the first of several cups of Stumptown Coffee in hand that our morning began and with The Doors alternating to country tunes and 70s hits overhead it would not be long before our savory course arrived, each plate well-crafted with subtle nuances to be discovered amidst decidedly conspicuous portions as the biscuit proved amongst the best in Vegas while the chili walked a fine line between heat and sweet, the white cheddar lending a sharp salinity at the top of each bite.  Always a sucker for sweets it was onward to the griddle that our meal progressed and again investing in a duo I was immediately impressed by the toothsome cornmeal pancakes enveloping a core of butter cookies and fresh fruit only to then be let down by the French Toast that was simply too 'wet' with custard to stand up to the heavily sugared bacon and sugar-torched fruit, the amalgam altogether too sweet and in need of some sort of textural variance - perhaps something along the lines of a trip to the deep-fryer in order to crisp the bread as was done in the case of a 'Monte Cristo' more than happy to eschew any facade of healthiness as smoky marshmallow fluff encased in golden brioche found balance in cinnamon spread and rich chocolate, the housemade raspberry preserves a nod to the classic adding a fruity finish that lingered long on the palate.",

The other three in my group ordered the famous mac and cheese burger which was phenomenal - the center oozed with creamy mac and cheese in addition to the amazing flavored beef patty. I opted for the healthier option and ordered the Caesar salad with the mega-crouton and chicken, and boy was the a HUGE fresh delicious salad, I had to bring the other half back for leftovers. I also ordered the sashimi won-tacos which had great flavor and crunch. The meal just hit the spot and filled us up for the long night of dancing.",

    "text": "OMG this is a place not to miss.  Quite simply...get the Burger.  This is the place to go if you want an outstanding \"Gourmet\" burger.  Our first experience with Guy Fieri and his delectable burgers was on a recent Carnival Cruise where Carnival introduced  \"Guy's Burger Joint\" on some of their cruise ships.  No joke...the burgers were so delicious and bursting with flavor that we ate there 6 out of 7 days on the cruise...sometimes twice, most times even avoiding the gourmet meals provided by the cruise.  And we were not alone. So after a late night show in Vegas we discovered Guy had a restaurant in the \"Quad\" and had to try it out. The restaurant offers ample outdoor seating for great late night people watching on the strip.  As for the menu:   My wife and I split the \"Original Smash Burger\" and an order of \"Vegas Fries\".  The smash burger just melts in your mouth with bursting flavor...it is like an unbelievable taste beyond anything you have ever  experienced.  The burger comes with its own set of \"fries\"...a collection of different types of fries along with blue cheese and buffalo sauce for dipping.  The Vegas fries are also a taste sensation and \"rolled\" in buffalo sauce and again bursting with flavor.  Hint: next time, my wife and I agreed...no splitting of the burger (cause you just can't get enough)...and the burger comes with fries as well.  (Who Knew).  There are tons of other choices but why venture beyond the burger.  And best yet...we don't have to wait a year for our next Carnival cruise to get our Guy Burger fix!",

However, the Hot sauce did enhance the flavor even more. The fried ice cream was humungous! I'm pretty sure 3-4 people can take that on instead of one person. It was covered with cornflakes and came with banana and peanut butter, strawberry and pineapple, hot fudge and maple syrup. Combine everything together and it is delicious. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because the service was slow. Our waiter took forever in getting us water and taking our orders. We even had different waiters filled our water and bring out our food. And while I see other waiter walking around doing things, my waiter was no where to be seen.",

The manager explained that \"there's only one guy in the back polishing glasses\" and the water for the older casino was not soft. I still find this to be an unacceptable excuse for an establishment that serves $20 burgers. Hard water may leave spots, but there are clearly lip marks from oils/material left from another person on the glass. Check out the pictures.",

The fries were so good that I honestly wasn't as hungry once my burger arrived, but I still cut that sucker in half and did my best to eat every bit. I ordered the mac n cheese burger with a special request of pastrami on it. Figured I switch it up a bit and I was happy to do so. Our server was name Nick and he was FANTASTIC. Superb service for a burger joint. He made our experience that much better due to his patience and willingness to help us find the entrees we were in the mood for and we appreciate that.   So for recommendations, here our suggestions.  Truffle fries (be carefully as the portion is super large)  Pepperoni sticks (personally liked the dip more than the sticks but the wife liked them)  Chicken wings (good and fancy not mind blowing)  Mac n cheese (overrated in my opinion or more like the outback of steakhouses kind of burger) if you like outback, you'll likely like this burger.",

The high tables are super uncomfortable if you don't have long, long legs.  I am 5'6\", so not very short, but too short for comfort at one of those tables.  The wooden stool just dug into my legs the whole time because my legs just weren't long enough for my feet to rest on the top rung of the stool.  I tried a couple dishes here, the Tripple T Fries, which were delish.  I could seriously live on them.  They are thin cut fries so nice and crispy with loads of truffle.  They are seriously a 5/5.  What I was not crazy about was the Gnarly Greek Salad... this was the least Greek salad I have ever tasted in my life.  I understand that Guy does his own take on recipes, but this was taken so far to the extreme that it wasn't even recognizable.  It had croutons, carrot and chickpeas which was odd, but okay.  What was unforgiving to a Greek salad though is that there was no tang or zip to the dressing.  It was a little sweet and just not very tasty.",

The blue cheese dip for the fries was great too and I'm not big on blue cheese. Also got some drunken fish tacos but I would go back for those fries alone. Good presentation was great, prices were not bad it's a good place I would recommend.  We sat outside, it was fun to people watch!",

However, I would have liked the mac and cheese to come through more, especially if it's named the mac and cheese burger.  The BBQ wings were quite good, the sauce was the BEST. Better than any hot wings restaurant I've been to. I never really expect much out of bbq wings because they're normally very similar, but this one surprised me.  Women may feel slightly out of place. This restaurant has a very \"manly\" vibe to it.",

I explained to the waiter that my wife does not eat ground beef and if there was any way she can just order a grilled cheese sandwich? The waiter looked at me like I had ordered something out of this world and said I don't think so. I stated to the waiter to please check. The waiter came back a few minutes later and said the cook said no we cannot do that.  Talk about poor customer service. We will never go to any of Guy's restaurants. We were big fans of his.

Not my favorite dessert... The description didn't say that it was deep fried (like a doughnut) but it was.  We didn't finish it.  The restaurant itself was really pretty cool... But I think most of the restaurants I Vegas are... They certainly charge enough.  We had 2 specialty cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table (that we're really good and the bartender as really cool)  that cost us $24 plus tip and then our burgers,  1 more rail drink and a dessert for a little more then $60.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you want a really good burger while your on the strip",

The Mac and cheese was not creamy at all in fact it was not even hot. The burger itself was ok. I've had better. Burgerologys Mac and cheese burger is hands down the best I've had, sorry Guy!!  We ordered the cheesecake for dessert to share among 4. Trust me it was a huge serving so a great dessert option to share. I'm f NY so cheesecake is something I know!!  We all agreed the cheesecake was dry but we ate it. The salty sweet is just very nice!!  Overall we really enjoyed our meal, the service amazing and not overly overpriced.",

I looked at the menu before we got there and it looked good....so first off we get there they have no nachos (their seasonal) WTF....second I order a turkey burger and they have no more turkey Ridiculous! And lastly I order hot wings which is my favorite but I wanted something else...the menu said larger wings (I wonder how small they were before) because mines was baby Cornish hens size lbvs...I then asked the waiter since they didn't have the turkey burger can I get some complimentary fries he said we'll see (WHAT)...of course I didn't get them.   Oh yeah I almost forgot the burgers are damn flat and crunchy my sister said the worst burger ever! I'm glad I didn't get one lol",

Our table was next to the busiest part of the restaurant, with food constantly coming out of the kitchen behind us and patrons trying to get around them to either exit or enter the establishment. Our table was bumped several times while waiting for a long period of time to receive our food. The Nachos were ok, just to be nice. BBQ sauce on Nachos didn't work for us. The other was so horrible that we didn't even break the surface. We decided against drinks and ordering entrees. I would suggest to try the many other fine establishments around this location. Not worth the wait or headache. We are Vegas locals and will never return again.",

My nachos had way to much cheese and cream that overpowered everything else and gave me a stomach ache afterwards. The cocktails were ok.  Overall, everything was waaay overpriced, but I should know better in Vegas.  On a more positive note, the French fries are delicious!!",

    "text": "There are few culinary experiences that can adequately prepare you for a layover in flavortown.  Having spent a good portion of my adult life watching Triple D, and with a healthy respect for all that is Guy, I would have been remiss if I didn't make a pilgrimage to the temple of Fieri while on business in Las Vegas.  I would later discover that the decision would be the best of my entire journey through Sin City, and stands as the crowning achievement of the trip.  Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen + Bar is located inside the Quad on the Vegas strip.  Walking in is an experience in visual and aural stimulation, complete with a haphazard blend of memorabilia and celebrity autographed knick knacks stapled on the walls throughout the establishment.  The staff is attentive and eager, even on a slow Monday lunch shift, and I was particularly impressed by the pony tail on one young gentleman working an outdoor seating section of the restaurant.    My culinary experience, as I had been hoping for, was \"off the chain\".  Being a Triple D fan, it was only natural for me to select the \"Triple B\" burger complete with bacon, bleu cheese, brioche bun, and a healthy helping of Guy's very own \"donkey sauce\".  The concept of portion size has long been proven obsolete, and Guy's burger made my stomach cower in fear.  I struggled to find places to stuff my enormous smoky burger, and enjoyed every minute of the battle.  The extensive beer selection is sure to satisfy any palate and would have left me wanting more were it not for how uncomfortably full I was at the end of my meal.    The staff at the restaurant are very friendly, engaging, and encouraging when you find yourself torn between the \"Parmageddon Wings\" and the \"Motley Que\".  Our particularly buxom bartender was keen to promote the \"Tapped by Guy\" deal, but my liver and kidneys were on strike and vetoed the idea immediately.  In hindsight I would have told them to get stuffed and pulled the trigger on a 16 beer flight, but I suppose I'll have to save that for my next trip to Vegas.   All in all, I am ecstatic that I was given the opportunity to experience Guy's kitchen, and I will absolutely be back if I find myself in Vegas again.   TLDR: This place kicks ass.  Spend every dime you have there. Long live the mayor of flavortown. #SoMuchSalamiCallMyMommy.",

As huge fans of mr.Guy we anxiously awaited our food  we ordered wasabi ahi tacos bloody Mary's and buffalo fries. Tacos low spice. Drinks were sweet but did order extra spice. I think the tomato was the sweet part. Fries were salty. Service was poor. Never got extra napkins when asked for or plates. No fish sandwich option told it was seasonal. Really? Poor for non beef eaters. Bill 88.00 for 4 drinks 1 fry and 1 taco order. Wouldn't mind if quality were better. We won't return. Sorry Guy :(",

However, we waited about 15 minutes for our server to even come by, and it probably would have been longer had we not flagged down another server.  And she was ok, but not great.  I order the pulled pork sandwich without the slaw and the \"donkey sauce (which looks like a spiced mayo)\" on the side.  The pulled pork was good.  The BBQ sauce was spot on and the pork was tender.  It was served on a very good pretzel roll.  The fries that were served with it were not good at all.  They were WAY too spicy.  The menu didn't have a whole lot of options for people who don't eat spicy foods.  One of my friends had what I had and he felt the same way, while my other friend had the Mac & Cheese burger which looked great and she enjoyed it. I'd like to go back and try their breakfast, but I think I'll pass on their lunch/dinner again, until they widen the menu to include some savory items that are not all spicy.  It was ok, but not great.  There are much better restaurants in town.",
