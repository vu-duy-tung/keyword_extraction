The restaurant's specialty yellowtail with yuzu is pretty good, got to love the fried garlic on top! (wish there was more). The house salad was tasty and i would recommend it as a break from all the heavy usual US salad. As for the tempura, the frying dough could have been puffier and lighter, but other than that this place is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.

The owner was very nice and came to introduce himself to us and even got me a free dessert.  I'm in love with their Green tea creme brulee.  I had a great experience trying what they had to offer.  Will definitely be back.  I love sushi and sashimi and I usually crave it every week.   They offered more of sashimi like dishes which is great since I usually order only nigiri and prefer sashimi since I don't really care for sushi rice.  I'll be back soon.",

The golden ocean trout has pop rocks in it and it gives the fish a good taste ! If I'm feeling fancy, I get the premium sashimi because their uni is AMAZING ! Their uni is always so fresh and it tastes exactly what uni should taste like! The nutter pillar roll is also great! The macadamia nuts on top give it that great crunch that I never knew I needed from a sushi! I would highly recommend coming here because I think it is the best sushi restaurant in Vegas !",

    "text": "We are of town and came in for lunch first time from seeing their good reviews on Yelp. Honestly, I don't understand where the good reviews came from. Their food was ok, not great, I've had way better sushi. Their customer service was terrible. It was lunch time and they only have a couple table and a few people at the bar. There were still many empty tables. We came in with 7 adults and 5 kids, sat down the check in table, and no one came to greet us. After a few minutes, the only apparent server asked us if we've been helped. They didn't have a table for our big party at the moment so we would have to wait but we said we didn't mind splitting into 2 tables since we (and the kids) were hungry. Well it took a very long time for them to set up 2 tables even though there were so many tables empty. Then after us asking a couple of times, they sat us down into 2 tables, 1 for 10 ppl and and 1 for 2. That was so odd, and again they said that was all they could do. I would think they would split us into 6 and 6 or 7 and 5 or something. Anyway, so we went and fit ourselves into the 10 ppl table and put 2 people on each end and it fit fine. Then we sat and waited until someone would take our orders. We kept looking and they said someone would take our orders but no one did. The servers seem busy bringing food to other tables and cleaning up tables and they just let us sat and wait. Ok so finally after telling us someone would help us twice, they finally took our orders. The food came out was not too rated. So my question came again. How did this place got all these good reviews with the kind of service and food they provide? I guess there is a first time for everything. But we will sure not come back here on our next Vegas trip. Oh they do add tip to big parties, which is probably why they didn't want to split our tables.",

The Cajun albacore, black cod and mussels were all good. The rolls were nothing like blow me out of the water and I didn't care for the stuffed mushrooms. We ordered some uni and toro from the specials menu...verdict...uni sashimi was on par but the toro was yuck! At $10 a piece you would have thought that it would be some awesome toro but $20 bucks went down the drain (at Kabuto toro is $7 a piece).  It was firm and the texture was not the melt in your mouth toro. I know everyone loves it here but I feel their quality of fish is hit or miss. Obviously for me it's been miss.   Service was great in the beginning but then we didn't see our server for a good 15-20 minutes after we got our food. Overall, I'm really disappointed about the toro. I don't cheap out when it comes to delicious food and I just feel a little bit let down. The wow factor just hasn't wowed me I guess. I'll be giving this place a break for now.",

Tay was my chef,  surprised me with a yellowtail spring mix and deep fried jalapeno and what looked like ponzu but had a twang that made the whole dish awesome.  The fish could have been mediocre and still a good dish,  but it was all aces.  Classic spider roll,  a tuna lovers roll that could have been the whole meal,  and generous nigiri. The fish is fresh,  the flavors almost futuristic,  these guys have a terrific sushi experience.  I recommend them,  high energy competent staff, attractive clientele,  get in here.",

    "text": "Could this be one of the easiest 5 star reviews I've ever had to write? Hands down, YES!! I came here for happy hour and my friend and I tried about everything on the list.   While everything we tried was fantastic, my overall favorites were the Cajun Albacore Sashimi, Tadas with Yellowtail, and the Shrimp-Avacado roll.   The tadas were the most \"fusion\" like thing we tried. A mixture of \"ceviche like\" spice accompanied with tostadas and touch of lime, I ordered two plates to myself!  The cajun albacore sashimi....can I drool any longer? I loved the light cajun seasoning idea. This dish, along the with others at Soho, doesn't take away from the idea that I'm eating sashimi. Some places fuse dishes together to make something completely new altogether, which usually turns into a sad \"miss\" from me.   We received a recommendation from our server Boris to try the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy off the regular menu. Oh boy oh boy oh boy!!! I've gravitated toward yellowtail and albacore of late, and this recommendation was right on the money. Our servers, Boris and Candice, were extremely attentive and spot on on their recommendations based on questions of what our palettes gravitated to.   I'm very happy to have found this gem. When I come back in town in a few weeks with friends, I know exactly where I'm taking them to.",

The compliments are piled on here and the adage that going off the strip in Vegas will lead you to some incredible restaurants wth great value certainly holds True here. The sushi is fresh and hand made in an open kitchen. The \"one bite\" appetizers (which I can remember but are basically a fish salad of some type on a chip) are delicious. The sushi is delicious - we loved every roll and they all my only had the quality of begin beg high quality, but try had the quality of quantity too - these rolls aren't skimpy!  The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and quantity you receive - I am so happy we ate here!",

When I looked at the menu it didn't have a large sushi selection and it had a small wine menu.  The wine I got was only okay and my husband's wine was way too sweet.   The miso soup was really good, but the disappointing part was the sushi.  With all the amazing reviews thus place got I thought u would be having mind blowing sushi but it was just average.  Nothing to spectacular but also nothing bland.  It was just just okay.    Dont get me wrong it is a great place for dinner but if you're in the mood for sushi there are better places to go.",

The happy hour deal only makes it better but I'd be coming back time and again even if I miss happy hour.  My favorite dish on the menu is the crispy rice with spicy tuna but I don't think you can go wrong with anything.  We also loved the yellowtail and tuna tostadas, the Cajun Albacore Sashimi (we got 2 plates!), the Escolar Carpaccio and the Firecracker Roll. Next time, I'll have to try the Salmon tostado and the twin dragon roll.   We also had the Chicken Karage, Salmon Avocado Creme and the Yellowtail with Yuzu - all were delicious but similar to what I've had in NY (which isn't a bad thing!) so note to self, next time I'll save my \"stomach space\" to try some different dishes!",

Wait was also SUPER long on a late Tuesday evening-about 45 minutes long.   Upside:   Hostess and waitress were both super and attentive and helpful and friendly and refilling my green iced tea and making convo so that was nice.  Food was good and fresh, just slow. Long wait for everything. After waiting so long to be seated and then waiting so much more for each course/roll order, it was just a very long dinner experience.   We tried their most popular rolls-see pics and the sashimi. We also had the shrimp and veggie tempura, the edamame and the miso soup and that was all very standard/average.  The one thing I didn't like: we told the waitress we were celebrating a birthday and she didn't do anything for us but the table next to us had singing and the works. Kinda bummed me out at the end. But overall, it was good and we enjoyed it. Just mega pricy.",

Yes Chef John Chien Lee and the staff are pretty awesome.  I could easily give Soho a 4-5 star rating.  Everytime I've been here I've been impressed more than the last. I'm sure if I was to go tomorrow I would also be impressed.   When coming here you need to know that their dinner menu is a lot better than their lunch mainly because a lot of the must have items are served during dinner.  If you do come here for lunch they have this Lunch Seto for under $10 and it includes one from eight items which includes Salmon Teriyaki, Loco Moco, and Sashimi and it's served with yummy salad, rice, and miso soup.  It wasn't that bad. Here's my Sashimi Lunch Seto <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=7DpWBN02wkQ1TrtPkHVt0A#7DpWBN02wkQ1TrtPkHVt0A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> They also have a few sushi rolls, salads, and appetizers served during lunch.  One thing you should do is ask if they can serve any of the dinner items. I've asked twice and both times they were willing to make an item off the dinner menu. Just ask, the worst you'll get is a no and you order something else.  I have many favorites one is probably the bone-in short rib, it is a must. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=j8BK5DiHa-eVduVUKJFmXA#1xEgn9UQF6V3E9rtMvs2-w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> It is so tender that you can cut it with a chop stick and so delicious that you'll probably want more after eating your entire order. It is a little fatty and just melts in your mouth. I'd order some rice with it but you can eat it on its own or with a sushi roll.  For apps one of my favorites are the Garlic Shishito Peppers <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=j8BK5DiHa-eVduVUKJFmXA#lKya5IUtF4FBqA7I2wr0gQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> they are good and I have to have them each time I'm here. They're like candy.  Another of my favorites apps are the edamame <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=j8BK5DiHa-eVduVUKJFmXA#VtxviC2KrM4-pOYMYGdz9A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> it's the first time I've had it with large salt crystals and really made a different for me.  Another is the Hydro Bibb Black Cod, it is basically a marinated miso cod topped with wonton crisps in a lettuce cup. It's light and delicious.  I only had one of their sushi rolls which was ok but have had majority of their non-sushi roll items, this is clearly where they excel in.  The chef is very creative, if you order ahead he'll make a very nice platter of various sushi and sashimi pieces.   They have a nice big screen TV and very comfortable chairs. Sitting at the bar is a bit awkward, I kept banging my knees on the underneath parts of the counters. Spacious but does occasionally fill up. This is not All You Can Eat unless you have lots of money.",

I thought we'd just show up and wait for a table since I wasn't super hungry, and I knew the food would be worth the wait. When I arrived, I stood at the door for another 10 minutes before someone even greeted me. I wasn't pretending I was already waiting for a table (aka off to the side, staring at my phone), I was standing in the middle of the entrance, eyeing any and all of the staff, hoping someone actually look at me, and maybe even come over and greet me. I decided not to give them my business and went down the road and had a much better experience and the food was just as good.  The good part: Food here really is good. The waitstaff service also use to be excellent when I was frequenting this restaurant more regularly last year.  I feel as if their service has suffered from their success. I'm not likely to return any time soon, sadly.",

A warning to those that do not have their own vehicle that it was a bit difficult to get a cab back.   Despite any transportation issues, the meal was completely worth it. We went for lunch and sat at the sushi bar as all of the other tables were taken. We started with a couple basic rolls as well as salmon nigiri. Each piece was excellent. A fresh as promised. I took the advice of the either reviews and tried the tuna tostada. The single best thing I ate in Vegas. The tuna was expertly cut and just the right amount of sesame. We each had a salmon teriyaki bento box. The salmon is grilled and the sauce is served on the side to allow you to choose the amount of teriyaki. The bento box includes a slaw, salad with ginger dressing, steamed white rice, vinegar cucumber salad and miso soup. Each part of the meal was lovely.  The restaurant interior is very basic. The kitchen is open to the dining area and you can watch the sushi chef prepare orders. Despite how busy the restaurant was, our food came out quickly. Our server was polite and attentive.   I wish Soho was closer to home!",

Everything about this place is A+++  The staff always friendly, from servers that bring you to your tables (I've only seated at the sushi bar) and the chefs all incredibly nice and friendly.  The first time we went, they gave us a free dish, second time, they gave us free appetizer because they felt like we were \"waiting\" for our food.  Not many restaurants have customer service to this level with almost all the staff.    The seafood/fish is incredibly fresh.  The sashimi platter (deluxe or premium) are a steal.  The pieces are huge and beautifully decorated in a giant ice bowl.  Not many people do that now unless the really fancy Japanese places in town.  Definitely worth every penny for it, and by no means it's expensive.    The other dishes are also amazing, they have daily specials and their salmon/kanpachi/hamachi kama are also a steal at $5 for giant piece.  The ocean trout with the pop rocks are awesome, all the tostadas, salmon carpaccio...etc. all amazing and incredibly fresh.  I haven't had anything that I dislike here.  And their Happy Hour from 4-7 is the best Happy Hour in the world...lots and lots of items to choose from and all normal portions, not skimp you on it because it's only $5 on HH size, it's amazing how they do it.    I LOVE this place and really, don't doubt the yelp reviews and the high rating of this place, it's the bomb and I am a sushi lover and snob at times too.  They close on Sundays, so go everyday when you can because you'll love it.",

The green tea cream Brule and  green tea tiramisu were interesting. I probably would not order tiramisu again because it tasted just like a sponge cake.

    "text": "I came here with my family and friend who was visiting us from out of town. I ordered two orders of snow crab California rolls and grilled salmon. I was wondering what all the hype was so here's my final verdict.   Customer service was ok. We had people coming by non stop offering my friend more hot tea that he had ordered. It was in fact, quiet annoying because I think in the less than hour ish visit, servers came by around 8 times to check on us and offered green tea refills... for ummm, just for my friend. I didn't need any water so I never asked for a refill. They came by to refill water once, so kudos for remembering us water drinkers. Then they probably come by 3 additional times to check to see if we were OK again. Gee, I didn't need to be checked on us every 3 minutes.   It's 4am in the morning and I can't sleep. I'm thirsty and my tongue feels really nasty. I also had to apply ChapStick. Why? I think what I ate had a TON of msg!!!   I live in Vegas and I frequent a lot of AYCE sushi buffets but knowing that I didn't have AYCE at Soho, why do I feel so thirsty right now like I had eaten at a buffet? It's not fair cuz I only had two snow crab California rolls and a grilled salmon mini plate.   I just wanted to warn anyone who only eat cooked meat to be careful. You're going to feel thirsty. I'm just glad my 22 months old daughter refused to eat any of the food here because it wouldn't have been nice if she wants the one up right now lol. And if you're planning to bring your children to eat here, think twice. Your kids might wake-up at night crying for water.",

I have been here multiple times and each time is consistently amazing.   Tonight we were offered \"Omakase\" meaning \"Chef's choice\" in Japanese for a VERY reasonable price, which was less than half of what I paid at my last Omakase experience a couple months ago at another Japanese joint. Ordering this way is almost like getting the freshest prix fix menu where the food comes out in courses. There were cold appetizers, hot ones, grilled treats, rolls, frozen dessert...the list goes on. One of our friends had a food allergy to garlic and the Chef did a great job of accomodating her.  Try SOHO out during Happy Hour (4-6PM everyday) and you will be hooked, then come back for the Omakase for dinner or special occasion.",

    "text": "If you're a fan of modern Japanese -- the kind that Nobu made popular and places like Social House reimagined -- you'll love the food at Soho. The chef owner is the former executive chef at Social House and has brought his fusion-style of cooking to the 'burbs. That means Strip-quality food at off-Strip prices.  The strip mall location is nothing special and the interior is quaint and understated. But, it's the food that shines at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with the yellowtail yuzu soy ($10), tuna or hamachi tostadas ($2 ea.), or the angus gyoza ($5). The miso marinated black cod ($18) is as good as any I've had on or around the Strip (including the one at Nobu).  The variety of rolls may be limited, but the quality and execution is solid. This is not an all you can eat place, so expect to spend a little more for a higher end product.  The subtle sweetness and silky creaminess of the vanilla creme brulee ($5) was a great way to end the meal. If chocolate is your thing, try the chocolate mousse ($7). It's the perfect balance of sweet and bitter chocolate with cocoa crumbles and cookie pieces to add variety in texture.  The chef/owner stopped by to chat, which is always a nice touch to show that he cares about the diner's experience. With beautifully presented and well crafted food, Soho is a welcome addition to the local scene. For people on a budget, like myself, it's just another reason to dine in the 'burbs instead of the Strip.",

I particularly like: The yuzu yellowtail Cajun albacore Hyrdo bibb sea bass White peach sake  The hydro bibb used to be black cod but honestly the sea bass tastes the same to me. (Though in my case I only eat here maybe twice a year while visiting.)  Other notes: Small restaurant,  expect to wait during peak hours Try the green tea tira misu when they have it in stock Ladies room has two stalls, which is a nice surprise lol  Though Soho seems to be more of a $$$ restaurant than a $$ restaurant,  it's actually quite affordable for the quality of the sashimi you get. Ordering a roll will help fill you up. I think the white peach sake is a great deal, you are getting a small bottle of a strong yet sweet sake for only $9, which would normally get you one watered-down cocktail somewhere else.",

What with all the fake reviews and the like that go on, but damn was my skepticism completely unwarranted.   Myself and my date got there at 7:30 on a Thursday night with a 15 minute wait. Not bad at all, the hostess was very polite and took my name down. We had a beer next door and had a table 12 minutes later. Then this place began to shine.   I ordered the same thing I ordered at every new sushi place I try. The common every day sushi items that are either sub bar, usual or extraordinary. Salmon and Salmon roe nigiri and a spicy tuna roll. This place blew my mind. The Salmon tasted like an Alaskan stream ran through the restaurant. The roe had the perfect consistency. An 'al dente' texture to its bite and a pleasant fresh saltiness. The spicy tuna was perfect.   I was almost about to start popping bottles and shaking hands and then something bad happened. My soft shell crab roll didn't appear for 10 minutes, then 15 and then 20. This was okay as I was having a nice conversation with my date and she was enjoying her monstrous chicken salad and just as I looked up to complain the very nice waiter supplied us with some complimentary hot house sake for the wait, and moments later a large order of spicy yellow-tail sashimi (6 pieces).   This was outrageous good service. I hadn't even complained yet, but they knew. \"From the chef\" he said. And walked away politely, then my roll came out.   Everything was perfect. They were busy, I can understand why the roll took a minute. I was walked out the door like I was a senator with a stripper on my arm.   Definately coming back. 5 stars more than earned Soho! Good job.",

A good 15 min drive from our hotel (Aria) but definitely worth it.  The menu is limited until Jan 8th but the servers are very accommodating so if you have something in mind just ask. By far the most amazing salmon I ever had is the Salmon wasabi creme. I devoured 2 orders myself! The ambience is casual but the food itself is like your in a 5 star restaurant without the 5 star price. MUST TRY-  * of course the salmon wasabi creme * SoHo Maki, basically long thin spring rolls but believe me ur taste buds will thank u. * yellow tail sashimi BOMB * DONT LEAVE WITHOUT ORDERING THE creme brulee IT IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. The flavor the texture it is the high light of our meal.  Everything we ordered I enjoyed but those are the top 4 must try dishes. Only bummer was because of the holiday special menu I didn't get to order oysters and the kani. But next time I'm back in Vegas I'll be heading over again. And let's not forget the service! Attentive staff, friendly, and owner makes it a point to go to every table and ask how we like our dishes and even sent over a sashimi plate on the house. I'm predicting this place will soon have lines out the door.",

Atmosphere (4/5): Average noise levels, very comparable to other sushi or AYCE restaurants. Good for a large gathering, etc.  Service (3/5): This place was very accommodating with 15-20 people. All though it could be because they knew that we were with Yelp. It seemed like that their staff was not the most attentive or trained. One of the waitress actually managed to pour left over sauce over  one the my friend's dress. Which was an accident, but that just shows that they need to improve their Service.  Food (3/5): Food was way better than their service. Restaurant actually made a tasting menu for everyone at the table. Here is what we had.  Seared Tuna with Tempura Jalapenos: It will be spicy. Seared Tuna was fresh, but I am not sure if Jalapenos go well with it. Also, there was lot of ponzu sauce.  Pot-stickers Meh... I would say avoid it, you do not go to restaurant like this for their pot-stickers. They didn't seem fresh and it seemed like they were adding them to our tasting menus cause they had bunch sitting around in the freezer.  Seared Yellow-tail: The fish was fresh and it was seared to perfect amount. Unlike the Tuna, they didn't over do it with sauce. Presentation was good to.  Oysters: They were not good. I do not like oysters drenched with sauce. Specially when its  sweet and sour. Oysters are enjoyed with light lemon juice. That's it.   Short-Rib: Piece de resistance of the meal. You will see lot of reviews mentioning this and that is with the best reason. It's the main highlight of this restaurant and they know it (~$20 for a rib). The meat falls of the bone and it practically dissolves in your mouth. The taste is exquisite. Some short ribs did have a lot of fat on it, but its up to personal preference. Some people prefer the flavors that fat adds to a meal. I personally don't enjoy it because it will add another mile of running to my daily cardio.   Over all this restaurant is not bad for the location it's in, but if you have a choice of going to other place then I would highly recommend picking something else. The short-rib is the main attraction, but its not fully worth the price when you get a short-rib full of fat and less meat. Also, service needs a bit of a work.  Average: 3.5/5 - Being a man of science I round it down to (3/5), so other or I strive for more perfection. :D",

I ordered the salmon and mixed seafood tostadas, some kind of cod appetizer, the firecracker roll, and a basic salmon avocado roll. The fish here is so fresh and delicious ! The service is friendly but a little slow though. Still, definitely coming back - it's now one of my favorite sushi places !",

So as we were going to sit by the bar we saw empty table for 4 we asked if we can sit there they said no it's reserved!!!! They had the family of 5 coming after us (big size family) sit there. That was very unprofessional and I don't trust going to this restaurant again. They lied to us and they are biased to certain customers. Please watch out and don't go there.",

But I am soooo glad that I found this place because their food is just the best!! The fishes are really fresh and the service is really good. We were told that the Chef/Owner here used to be a sous chef at Aria hotel in Vegas and he always uses fresh ingredients. We ended up going here 2 times within 5 days during our trip. Our favorite dish was special appetizer yellow tail sashimi with soy Yuzu sauce, Miso marinated black cod, Fire cracker roll. All the rolls are good and I can't recommend enough!!",

I visited Soho for lunch with some locals, and was impressed by the quality of the food. The prices were amazing too. You can get a fantastic lunch for under $9, and that comes with salad, soup, and rice - on top of the main course.   I had the miso black cod on lettuce, and it was buttery and delicious. My friend had tuna tartare on wonton chips, and she loved it. They also gave us generous pours of wine, so that's a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you are visiting from out of town. It's a nice break from the craziness and high prices of the Strip. This'll be on my to-do list if I visit Vegas again.",

Whether they're assistants or THE chef, it doesn't matter. It took over an hour for they to prepare Sashimi supreme or whatever they call it. $35 for 18 pieces of sashimi, is OK. But the fact that the Sashimi were cut paper thin pissed me off. It was me and four other people, so obviously I tad to order them a bunch of other things. The only thing I liked about this place, was the friendly staff. \"But J, why not give them 2 stars since the wait staff was friendly?\" Because, imaginary friend that didn't experience the fury I felt. There were 5 bozos standing there behind the glass, why didn't my damn sushi and sashimi come faster?",

Seared tuna special: it was well seared, not too much and not too little. Excellent and delicious!!  The yellowtail and tuna were complimentary by the chef/owner!  What really impressed me was that he comes out and talks to his guest (each table) and makes you feel at home.  Relaxed and comfortable atmosphere with top quality food and service without the ridiculous strip prices.   This is my new favorite sushi joint!!  Loves it!!!",

They don't do all you can eat but with happy hour and how good everything is you don't need it. The service is always great, they take pride in their restaurant. And if you sit at the sushi bar they are very nice and hospitable! They always take care of us. Happy hour 12-7 has great deals, that's when to go!!! The ratio/portion of fish to rice is actually really good. Other sushi place give you a sad thin piece of fish on the rice so you mostly get rice. So what's good here....The salmon carpaccio and salmon avocado creme- really show off the freshness of the fish, I get it every time. Soho Tostada is a great mix of fish and mango/ Pico de gallo. The gesso (fried squid) is perfectly crispy with a curry aoli- perfect pair. They use REAL crab in their California roll. The twin dragon roll is a delicious monster roll! I enjoy the sunny salmon roll with salmon, crab, lemon. Muscles are good! Salmon avocado roll is fresh and again they actually give you a good amount of fish. Golden trout has pop rocks and it's pretty amazing/weird combo you should check it out. The short ribs are super tasty. And my friend loves the sliders. I love this place soooo much!",

    "text": "Ever feel like you're not quite ready to finish your vacation and head home?   That is exactly how I ended up at Soho for happy hour and spending an extra day in Las Vegas! I was excited to finally check off another bookmark from my list of places to try off the Strip.  The wait for 2 on a Tuesday night was estimated to be about 30-40 minutes, but we probably ended up waiting about 20. Not too bad for such a popular place. When we were seated, the menus were pretty overwhelming, but we got to ordering right away to get in on those happy hour prices.  FOOD: --------  HH Menu: * Baked Mussels - Everyone raved about these in their reviews, but we honestly didn't see the hype. Maybe I just can't distinguish between different baked mussels because of all the creamy sauce. * Cajan Albacore Sashimi - One of my favorite dishes of the night with just a tiny kick, nothing too spicy. Note: I'm a huge fan of Albacore so I usually fall hard for it. * Yellowtail Tostada - Fresh chunks of fish with tasty chips.   Starters: * Crispy Brussels Sprouts - A little bit too crispy! They were overcooked in way too much oil, such that the Brussels sprouts were no longer in round form and all the leaves had fallen off.  * Hydro Bibb Sea Bass - This miso Chilean sea bass served with lettuce cups is super flavorful! It made me crave the rest of the fish.  Rolls: * Flying Fish Roll - Recommended by our server to be his favorite, this roll did not disappoint with its soft shell crab, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, and creamy ponzu. Although a little too saucy for me, it was still really delicious.  Special: * Bluefin Duo - When this dish was grandly presented to the next table over in a huge bowl and with something tall curiously sticking out of it, we couldn't help but eye it and request one for ourselves. The special came with one piece each of Akami & Toro, so we ordered 2.  Dessert: * Green Tea Creme Brulee - I've had this dessert at other Japanese restaurants and rather enjoyed it, but this version surpassed all the others due to the deeper, more intense green tea flavor. Mm mm mmmm!!!  SERVICE / AMBIANCE: ----------------------- Our server was attentive and provided great recommendations. He didn't try to make us over-order, which would have been ridiculously easy, given how hungry we were. Instead he told us we'd ordered enough, and being the gluttons we were, we kept ordering.   The place is relatively small, so get here early (or arrive later) to avoid the long wait.   TIP: Get there on time for HH!  DATE TIP: You and your date better be ready to EAT because with how good the food is, you'll never want to stop!",

Everything was pretty good and the price is super cheap if u come for happy hour.  We ordered Uni sushi that is not on happy hour menu but it was super fresh!   Overall this place is a very good restaurant. The missing star is because the sashimi they used for the happy hour is not very high quality. Which is reasonable because the price is cheap. But when you eat raw, it is better to make sure its high quality.   But I would come back for their happy hour if I come visit again from LA.",

    "text": "Soho. For me this name is synonymous with sushi burritos. Fortunately for me I went in here so skeptical because I'm so anti-sushi burrito I just didn't think I could enjoy myself. Sure enough though I give this place five stars. I came here on a Saturday evening after the gym with my cousin and we had the most delicious meal for like $40. How? Happy hour! They have a $5 happy hour menu and it is killing the happy hour game.  I just want to give a shout out to the staff here. From the chef sending us a dish on the house to the servers who were always around it was just a great experience.  I came in gym shorts and a sweaty shirt, but the establishment is far from that. I love the yelling when a patron enters, I love the glasses they use, I loved the warmth of the staff.  Our food was great. We had a couple rolls, but my favorite dish was the tostadas. They are served in a do it yourself style with a \"poke\" mixture, rice tostadas, and a wasabi cream sauce. We chose yellow tail and it was to die for! I haven't stopped raving about this place since I went a couple of weeks ago because the food was so good.",

You don't want to miss out on something amazing.  Everything that comes out of this kitchen is delicious.  I haven't eaten a single thing I didn't like.  Every visit I seem to have a new favorite.   Right now I love the Brussel sprouts and the flying fish roll.  Also the new passion mango sake is yummy especially to pair during lunch time!",

All the fish/seafood are always fresh and the presentation is wonderful. I've also tried their omakase, which is a really good value and a good way to try their well-known dishes, such as the yellowtail yuzu, golden ocean trout, and braised short rib. The omakase ended with a matcha cheesecake and macaroons as desserts. I also go here a lot for happy hour, which is from 5-7 PM. Get there early as this place is always busy. $3 sapporo draft, $3 house sake, and a variety of food items for $5. Such good deals! Must get their cajun albacore, escobar carpaccio, baked mussels, and salmon carpaccio! Service is top notch! All the servers I've encountered are always so friendly and courteous. I also love sitting at the sushi bar because all the sushi chefs are awesome!",

This place is so awesome, we had to come twice on our short Vegas NYE trip. This will forever be my first stop whenever in Vegas!  This beats any sushi restaurant or buffet on the Vegas strip, so if you've stumbled across this restaurant like me, consider yourself lucky. The quality of sashimi is amazing! Everything melts in your mouth, and the prices are really decent. They offer amazing bento lunch specials, too. I love my sashimi so I got the sashimi bento both times I was here. They also have appetizers called \"Tadas\" which are little sashimi appetizers on top of crispy gyoza wrappers. Definitely worth a try! Or like me, order one (or a few) of everything.  Lastly, Green Tea tiramisu is not to be missed...that is if you still have room in your stomach. Can't wait to come back next time.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times and it was all during their happy hour except for the one time, we had it during lunch. You know what that means?! This review is solely based on those times! Happy hour is everyday from 4-6 pm and for lunch, they have pretty good specials available.   First and foremost, I do suggest sitting at the bar. I normally prefer sitting at tables but the bar at Soho is amazingly spacious. It was perfect. I'm not elbow to elbow with some random ass creeping stranger :P!   I've had their salmon avocado roll, firecracker roll, some appetizers, and their tadas. Their tadas are quite interesting cause it's a fusion mix of flavors on top of crispy rice and they're $1 each during happy hour so you can potentially try them all. The fish on those aren't particularly that great. Sometimes, they're actually mushy ...So they're nothing really all that special tbh but fun to try.  They put a good amount of salmon in their salmon avocado roll, which surprises me. It's so simple yet so delicious. I mean, for like $4, I'll take it! The firecracker roll has a really nice blend of flavors ranging from a little sweet, a little creamy, and a little spicy. One of the most memorable moments was when we ordered one of the rolls and we requested it to be spicy, the chef gave us some of his house made ghost chili sauce. I LOVE spicy foods and boy did this sauce hit the spot. Just a tiny dab with the chopstick is all I need to set my tongue on fire....it burns so good and so delicious. Try it if you dare ;) I swear...ghost chili is sweet.   Another favorite is their black miso cod in lettuce. It's pretty good except sometimes, I feel that their cod gets a little overcooked...still good nonetheless.   Oh and don't forget the lychee infused sake. It completes your happy hour night for sure!",

This time around after a morning hike, BF and his roomies stopped in for lunch. My everlasting indecisiveness had me choosing between the Soho loco or the *off menu* salmon skin bowl that Chef previously made me.  After the 4 boys made their lunch orders, to my shock, I ordered the sushi set lunch special...just because I never had it before.   It came out, and I was pleased with the thick cuts of sashimi and tempura sushi. I was quite full when the hamachi kama (I forgot we ordered) came out. HOLY COW! Literally, it was a cow. Thick piece of yellowtail collar, basically the size of a T-bone steak. I was so impressed because I've only ever seen small size of collar. Truth be told, someone told me that's the size of real collar and the small ones are the frozen ones -- who knew?!   I was soooo ridiculously full after that hamachi kama that kanak attack hit me and I was asleep for hours after I got home. Phew!",

    "text": "This review for my personal favorite Las Vegas restaurant is long overdue.   Chef John and staff are doing everything right - fresh fish, amazing sauces that are so thoughtfully executed, all at moderate prices with attentive service. You can find us here at all times of the day. Their lunch menu is affordable and my husband loves their take on hamburger steak + gravy. I love coming in during Happy Hour (4-6pm) and getting a sample of everything. The usual suspects being the tostadas (hamachi being my favorite), shrimp tempura roll, cajun albacore sashimi and the miso cod lettuce wraps. If we're here during dinner, we're getting the short ribs with a side of rice, although the potatoes that come with it are really tasty too. The lobster tempura and  the rock shrimp tempura are not oily and come with really tasty dipping sauces. If you ever want extra of any sauce, don't be shy, the staff is happy to oblige.    I've never really been too big on raw fish, but Chef John does it right. We've sampled a lot of the other sashimi and fresh fish offerings here, and have yet to be disappointed. Flavors are always complex and we love that Chef John sends us new dishes to try. Even our friends from out of town ventured out to eat here and were really impressed. This place is getting more and more popular, so I would recommend making reservations.   We also recently dined at Sen of Japan and were very disappointed with the food and experience (should have listened to Antonia R.'s review!). During that meal, all I could think of was how much better the food is at Soho, and how much better value you are getting for your money. Oh well, lesson learned!",

    "text": "While on a business trip to Vegas, some of my coworkers told me about this place and asked me to join them.  They had been once and loved it so much, they were going back again!  I have to say, I visited SoHo three times while on my trip!   It was that good!  Each time we went, we did enjoy their 'happy hour' sushi specials.  Each of us ordered three specials as well as some saki and we were able to be full and happy for under $25!     The Decor is modern asian and really was nice.  It was clean and the staff looked happy to be there.  Once seated, our server explained the specials and we all ordered from that menu.  The items started coming out only after a few min.  They all don't come at the same time which was fine since we started to run out of space on the table!    Everything was fresh and tasted great!  The presentation of each dish was also great.  It has to be one of the best sushi place I have ever been too.  I don't say that lightly either.  My fellow co workers also felt the same way.    The server was so nice and asked who we were and our what were our names.  When we were done and walking out the door, the entire staff behind the sushi bar said good bye and thanked us for coming in!  The next two times we came back in, they greeted us by our names!  The service was the best.    Atmosphere = 9  Service = 10  Food = 10  When you combine great food with wonderful service, you get a top notch place to come back to over and over again.  I only wish they had one in Orlando!  Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "A 5-star rated restaurant on Yelp is very hard to come by but leave it to the tourists, or wait, better yet, the locals, to lead you in the right direction when it comes to good food in Vegas.   Owned by Chef John Lee with his wife who also runs the dining area of the restaurant, the place seems to have something note-worthy going on. The quality of the ingredients they use are phenomenal, not to mention the exceptional freshness and grade of their fish. Like many, I value service that's genuine and efficient as well as a price tag that doesn't break the bank. This place has it all.  ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA ($9) started off our meal with 3 dipping sauces that accompanied it: wasabi aioli, sweet banana sesame, and garlic ponzu. If there was one dip we fought over who gets to lick the last bit of it, that'll be the sweet banana sesame.   SNAPPER w/ UNI ($13) initiated our cold sashimi orders. The presentation was so beautiful that all we wanted to do was stare at it. The inevitable was bound to happen and gladly we savored each bite appreciating how the uni did not overpower the snapper. Delicious!  SALMON WASABI CREME ($11) was highly recommended by our server and we took heed since we are big salmon fans. Clean flavors with a climax on the wasabi creme that sang melodiously altogether, this was easily my favorite out of all the sashimi dishes.  YELLOWTAIL YUZU SOY ($12) was served with \"compliments of the chef\" says our dear server. It was after all one of his most popular dishes and I completely understand why. The tempura serrano, cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust all worked harmoniously for the benefit of the fish.   BIG EYE TUNA POKI ($15) which was a special of the evening had a lusciously melt-in-your-mouth texture that only proves how fresh the tuna is. A much bigger portion compared to the sashimi dishes was a plus.  MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18) was cooked to perfection and was probably the best thing I ate here. So much for sharing but I'm getting an entree all to myself next time. Buttery yet flaky, black cod to me is the version of a grade-A Wagyu steak in fish.  TUNA TADA ($2) would be poki tuna on a tostada shell topped with avocado and cilantro. The contrasting textures of the crunchy shell to the tenderness of the fish and creaminess of the avocado was superb. For $2 each, can I have one more please?   SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ($9) seemed to be popular but this did not wow me in presentation, however, looks can be deceiving and I'll say it was very good. My daughter will vouch for it, too but I'm sure the spicy version of this is much better.  FIRE CRACKER ROLL ($9) was my least favorite as it had cream cheese in it. Not their fault, just my preference. This had spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried. Everyone else enjoyed it.     TWIN DRAGON ROLL ($15) won me over despite how stuffed I already was at this point. All the dishes we shared between 4 people but we all can't deny this roll was truly something with Alaskan King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and tempura shrimp. Without a doubt this was the best out of the three rolls we had.  MATCHA TIRAMISU ($7) ended our meal with a sweet note. Green tea soaked sponge cake and matcha sabayon topped with whipped cream were all there was to it but let your imagination run wild as to how heavenly scrumptious this really was.   Leaving us with a lasting impression, this entire meal kicked-off our weekend in Vegas with a bang!",

The ambiance is pretty nice on the inside and it was pretty packed (which is a good sign of great food) I ordered the Philadelphia Roll and can't quite remember the second roll however they were both extremely tiny and just okay nothing too spectacular. Don't think I'll be back considering the endless sushi options (not to mention I didn't even finish the second roll pictured...) but I guess it was worth it!",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've written a review as dieting has kicked in for me.  Hard to foodie it up while cutting the calories.  :)  Still, decided one random Thursday that sushi was going to be for dinner, as it had been a bit since I've had japanese.  Yelped a bit, since I decided our usual stomping grounds wasn't going to cut it, and found SOHO by accident.  Just so happens to be right around the corner from my place, so...off we go!  5:30pm on a Thursday and the place was PACKED.  I guess there's happy hour that runs here from 4-6 or something, so we got there just in time to pick a few things from that menu.  In particular, the mini-tostada things -- pretty dang tasty.  I only had the tuna one as I wanted to save calorie room for the rest of the meal.  But wife said they were all really good (at $1/ea, we ordered 2 of each for everyone in the family to share).  Before I go into the food, service here is excellent.  Server came by about 10 different times to refill our teas and waters.  Also gave some good recommendations on the dishes.  The place is very Yonaka-like in that the dishes are fusion and modern, but less saucy and faster plating (Hi chefs.  It doesn't take 30 minutes to slice 8 pieces of fish).  Couple of really outstanding dishes.  GET THE YELLOWTAIL JALAPENO SASHIMI - it is one of the the best yellowtail dishes I've had to date.  There's something about jalapeno, yuzu, and fatty yellowtail that just makes you go tingly all over.  The slight tangy acidity of the yuzu mixed with the creaminess of the fish fat, topped off with a twinge of heat from the fried jalapeno slices.  Ka-pow!  Order another!  Hydro bibb black cod - comes with a little piece of lettuce to wrap the finger sized appetizer in.  What's a hydro bibb?  Simply, it's hydroponically grown bibb (european butter) lettuce.  We originally thought it was some sort of science experiment, but went ahead and ordered anyway.  Glad we did!  One of the more savory dishes we had all night.  Tastes like eel, but without the bones, and all the protein of fish!  Tasty.  A few other dishes to touch on that stand out in my mind:   -soho maki - basically a thinly rolled eggroll with chicken and spring veggies; the sweet chili sauce makes this dish worth while.  We saw another table order 4 of these things...  -king crab tempura - this was on the specials board that night.  Came with some sort of aioli dip that was to-die for.  Was probably some sort of mayo based sauce that killed my diet, but dang it was good.  Had to do doubles during the workout just to burn that sucker off!  -ika geso - this is on the happy hour menu.  Basically, little tiny fried squids.  For those of you on a dietary challenge, squid is high protein, low fat.  Little high on the cholesterol, but a few tentacles won't kill you.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little spot in a strip mall (next to a subway and family practice.  We will definitely be coming back for fresh fish another time!",

The black cod and the any of the tostadas are to die for!   My favorite part of the experience is when the chef brought out the freshest uni I have tasted by far.

Recently though, my girlfriend and I came back, starving, after UFC, and we sat and the bar and took the time to really enjoy the food. The chef, I think his name is Nunu, was actually transported there after he left a fancy place called Social House at Crystals. Actually, we learned that day after chatting with the chefs that they all came from fancy strip-sushi restaurants. Their preparation was amazing, and their foods were delicious! We tried a lot of good things that night but their 3 kinds Uni was amazing! Its the best thing I've had ever. And to think I didn't like uni before.. Probably because it wasn't as fresh as this!",

    "text": "Intro: My boyfriend and I love having a favorite sushi restaurant. After moving close-ish to the Vegas area, we weren't too impressed with what the strip had to offer because it all seemed overpriced and overhyped. We came here on a whim because we were hungry and this popped up on Yelp.  Pros: -This place is absolutely amazing!!! The selection is completely unique!! What made our first visit to the restaurant a very memorable one was when the chef came out to say hi and recommend the ocean fish dish. It had an indescribable sauce (I think yuzu was in it?) and was topped with poprocks and I know that sounds strange but oh my god was it delicious!! Who would've thought? But I don't think we would've ventured beyond the happy hour menu if he hadn't suggested it. -The happy hour is a REALLY good deal but only offers so much. Don't be afraid like we were to try other things on the menu!! -There seems to be an army of people preparing sushi every time we go, which I feel reflects on how much priority they put on the creation of the dishes. -Lychee or peach sake is so good! Again, we got it off the happy hour menu but I couldn't finish it by myself, they give you a decent amount. The glassware it comes in is utterly impressive too. I will have to take a picture and post it in the future....Looks like a bowl of ice water with a tulip bulb shaped vessel that sits in it. Guaranteed to make you feel fancy. -The atmosphere is non-intimidating and feels cozy yet clean and modern.   Cons: -Getting overstuffed on so much awesome!!! -It's not dirt cheap, be ready to shell out $25-$30 per person if you're really hungry. Maybe $20 per person if you're moderately hungry.  Conclusion: This is a one-of-a-kind sushi establishment and the kind of restaurant everyone needs to try at least once. It feels like you're that person on food network trying that really amazing artfully compiled dish with the \"MMMmmm\" face.",

Words cannot express what an great experience! So much so we tried to go back during our 4 day vacation!   Must go! Happy hour is a STEAL!",

They also for FREE gave us a sample (4 pieces of a new salmon dish) for us to try! I've never ever gotten free fish at any sushi place. And excellent fish at that! Absolutely amazing. Also, the main chef walked around and asked us how everything was. BEST SUSHI QUALITY AND SERVICE I've had in a very long time. The fish must have been out of Norway. That's how pure and good it tasted....finally found a wonderful sushi joint.",

Our server was very friendly, and the head chef personally spoke with each table dining. We needed transportation back to our hotel, and our server helped us arrange for it after our first cab bailed on us.  +1 Prices are excellent, and portions are large. Unlike strip restaurants, you'll receive 8 maki-rolls per order, and two pieces of nigiri per order. All of the fish we ordered was extremely fresh and tasted excellent.   +1 Location is off-strip, and in a quiet section of Las Vegas. Restaurant is also very clean inside, and well maintained.   +1 As I previously mentioned, the head chef meets with every table to ask how your food was. He is one of the nicest restaurant owners I have had the pleasure of meeting, and even provided our party with free samples of the restaurant speciality, a yellowfin tuna sashimi with jalapenos. The chef politely asked us to sample his newly received \"uni\" sea urchin from Japan against his current California urchin.   +1 To top our experience, our server gave my party free sushi pens and a free sushi keychain.   If I can summarize my experience at Soho, I would say that it was perfect, and definitely worth the trip from any strip hotel, and definitely the best sushi around.",

The kicker is the owner gives you complimentary items. There were 10 of us, including kids. The first day we went, they gave us the yellowtail with ponzu sauce. The second time, they gave us two orders of Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collars). Who does that? Soho does.  Can't wait to get back to the restaurant.",

Guy on phone answers back with, \" if you want\". Why would I ask? Wth. He says hold on one sec and five minutes into my phone wait, still holding but my grip has weakened  and so has my love for this place. I go here 3-4 times a month and than I get this. All I wanted was rice, shishitos, tuna tataki,  and cajun albacore. In restaurants you have to be consistent,  it's not about being escoffier one day and a burger king line cook the next. If your consistent , eventually that consistency will turn into greatness. Unfortunately this place obviously has workers in here who do not meet the consistency accord and do not want to be great. Huge disappointment,  one that I will share with all my restaurant comrades .",

We ordered the tempera shrimp roll, fire cracker roll, seaweed salad, dumpling, yellow tail sashimi, miso cod and vanilla bean creme brulee. The creme brulee is excellent, aromatic, creamy and well balanced sweet. The cod has good texture, tender, juicy and flaky. But I may want it to be less salty though. My friend had the rolls and the salad. I like the salad tastes very fresh probably enlightened from the vinegar. I am not big fan of sushi or sashimi. But my friend liked them a lot as well.  The manager is very friendly and attentive. He stopped by our table to make sure we are satisfied with our food and send us complimentary fish items for both times we visited. It seems he stops by every table at appropriate times. He waved to us from inside the open kitchen when we left as well.",

So why is it 5 stars!  - food and quality is ridiculous - the price is ridiculous - the service is on point - it's just a pleasure to eat there  This is one of those places I say you must try if you go to Vegas and don't wanna pay an astronomical amount of money but still get the same service and food quality. The only difference is the decor. I'm sure if you want a fancier place, then you might be underwhelmed. As for me, I'm all about the food and this place knocks it out of the park for me",

We were extremely disappointed with the sushi offerings on the strip - small, overpriced portions with questions on how fresh the fish was.  We had settled on this place in the Hotel/Casino we were staying at when I decided to check yelp one last time and found Soho Japanese Restaurant. Needless to say we walked out of the place and I'm happy we did.  Having the opportunity to travel the country due to work, I have had sushi in various major metro cities and SoHo Japanese Restaurant ranks in the Top 10!  I can't commend them enough on how good everything was. The service was fantastic, and the sushi was even better.  I can't remember the last time I had sushi and sashimi this fresh!  The portions and prices were right inline if not just awesome considering the quality, freshness, and presentation of everything.  Highly recommend the Yellow-tail Sashimi and the Twin Dragon Roll.  During our visit they had asked to re-seat us to accommodate a larger party.  Since the service up until then had been been great and we aren't jerks, we obliged to help them out.  Needless to say, we weren't expecting anything in return at all.  Not only did they bring out a nice bottle of Saki for us, they also gave us an additional Sashimi dish, both on the house.  Stand-up establishment!  Again, best service I've had in a long time.  Next time I am in Las Vegas and I spare time, I will definitely be back!  The owner and/or Chef should feel good about the great team of employees working here.",

This restaurant is my friend's favorite sushi spot and I can't wait to visit them again so that we can go once more. Two major thumbs up!!",

When we got there the hostess admitted that she overlooked our reservation and assured us that a table was leaving. She crammed us in the far back corner where nobody really cared to check on us, left our dirty dishes on the table until the bill came and we felt pretty much neglected the entire meal. I made sure to get our server's name Charles, he was awful and kept saying rude comments. I was asking about the specials and he basically made us feel stupid by telling us it's basically the same stuff on the menu. He asked us if it was our first time and then his reply was \"it figures.\" He made the whole experience much worse and although the food was fairly good the service made it not worth coming back. Very disappointed.",

I knew things are okay here now because the presentation and quality of the dinners had slipped a little while he was away. And I was right, lunch was great.  12 pieces of fish with the lunch special.  Choice of greens or seaweed salad, white or brown rice, miso or mushroom soup.  Add dessert for 2 bucks.  Fish were fresh tasting, chicken katsu is still the best in town. I miss the lunch bento tray.  It made feel like I was eating a lot more food.  It was the same amount of food as previous lunches but in the round plates, but I was still feeling hungry.  Baked mussels have a citrus flavor to it, the rock shrimp are good as ever. Overall, I am glad to have Soho back on my lunch rotation.",

They use real crab instead of imitation crab so even their California Rolls are super good. Last time I was there they had this Tako Salad on the specials and it was SO GOOD! Definitely try it if you are an octopus fan. The Miso Black Cod is delicious, one of the best places to get it if you don't want to pay $40 for it at Nobu!   The most memorable dish for me here is the uni! Not sure where the uni was from, but it was literally the sweetest and most buttery thing ever! Better than the ones I've had at Nobu and other expensive sushi restaurants! I'll be back for more uni very soon!",

Even the basic edamame is different from local restaurant, the souse I had with edamame is calamondin. I can taste the insistence on food of the chef. SOHO would be my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas!!",

Our server Mika was so helpful and since we were a party of 7 she suggested letting us try the top selections versus going off the menu while staying in specified price point.  All the dishes were amazing and their fish is top notch.  I can't say that anything we has was bad- amazing ahi, yellow tail, cod, lobster etc - fresh and creatively prepared.  I could live on the ahi poke crisps alone but can't say there was anything I wouldn't order more of.  The chef stopped over to check on us, which I thought was a nice touch.  Julie the hostess was also very helpful - and we enjoyed her assistance.  I live with a 2 mile radius of 4 sushi places in Silverado Ranch yet I can't wait to drive the extra miles back to Soho!",

Catalina uni was another fav. It's worth it to get it! Their homemade lychee sake was really good. Tasted like lychee and doesn't bite like some house sakes.

We had a party of 20, and their check splitting was very inefficient and confusing.  They had split the alcohol on a separate check and all additional orders made later on through the night on another check.  Needless to say it was frustrating. When taking a large party, have everyone bring cash.  This was the only complaint of the evening.   Otherwise, food, services, and atmosphere was excellent!",

Now you should prepare yourself to wait even if tables seem open...I know it sounds odd but this is a small place with a small kitchen so from what I can tell they seat based on the kitchens bandwidth.  This happened to us as the counter seating was open but they would not seat us primarily because they had a huge party (for this place).  With that said take the drive to SoHo, chill out with a refreshing beverage and prepare to eat some damn fine grub!",

I told a different server and he said it would be a few mins. I told both servers we had to leave at 12:50 to get back to work several times. Our roll never came so we just left. Food was good but service was horrible. I don't have any reason to return.",

I would go almost anywhere for a happy hour with $2.50 sake but their happy hour is unrivaled. Just go in and see.   I always appreciate a sushi joint with high quality fish that never seems pretentious. I love my speciality fish and Soho never disappoints.  The Diablo roll has got to be my favorite roll in town but you can never go wrong with their sashimi offerings (Ocean Trout and Pop Rocks... get the f--k out of here!!), their apps, pretty much anything on the menu.",

Their menu has a lot of great things and then has some ehh things as well but overall delicious!  Any of their sushi is awesome! I love their albacore sushi, yellowtail jalapeno, salmon sushi, and their cucumber salad!   I love a good miso black cod and saw it on the menu, so I ordered it. Unfortunately it was not up to my standards but that was the only thing that was up to par. It was very dry (I like it fall apart moist) and it came like in 3 tacos? Weird. But our waiter let us return it and get something else which was VERY sweet.  They also open at 11 and have a great lunch menu and \"bento\" lunch options so you get more bang for your buck!!!",

    "text": "I've had this bookmarked for a while and stopped in with a friend after several hours of errands on a VERY hot day.  I was seriously hangry.  The waiter was prompt and after receiving 3 menus I had to  ask a few questions.  The questions were answered and then we got into  an interesting conversation about Yelp.  I really appreciated his perspective and found it interesting.  Now for the food part... Yummy! I got korean BBQ beef ribs (I don't recall the exact name but it was tasty) and was offered a selection of side and one was a soup that was not the traditional miso.  Fish based broth that seemed less salty but more subtle.  I very much enjoyed that.  My dining partner had sushi and enjoyed it.  The waiter brought a couple of sample dishes.  One was brussel sprouts with pine nuts and something else.  All I remember is wanting to pour them down my throat.  They were really good.  Slightly sweet, lot of individual leaves that got crispy.  Just tasty as heck. (My dining partner is allergic to pine nuts so no-go on comment from her)  He also brought a dish that was yellowtail in Ponzo with a tiny bit of crunchy fried garlic and some kind of microgreen.  This is why I need to write my reviews promptly.  I'll just leave that one at \"yummy\" too.  Green tea cheesecake for dessert.  That was interesting.  I split it with dining partner and she could taste the green tea. I really couldn't.  I HATE raspberries and there were a couple on top so even after pushing them off.. I could taste the raspberries and she couldn't.  Still.. we both gave a thumbs up to that dish because it was good texture, not too sweet (even though I like REALLY sweet desserts when I'm in the mood) beautifully presented  and tasty.  There was zero delay in service except when we wanted a delay.  Not only was it a great meal but here's how you know it's a great place... I think we arrived around 2pm and there were quite a few customers.  By the time we were done I am going to guess it was about 3/4 full with more people arriving by the minute.  It's kind of hard to draw that kind of crowd tucked away in a little strip mall without having something going for you!  I'm going to go back and sit at the sushi bar next time and see if I can break a record for sushi eating.",

During happy hour I normally order my favs which are, salmon carpaccio, beef tataki, angus sliders and truffle fries.   Never a disappointment with each visit, that's how it should be. I only leave reviews after I've eaten to a restaurant quite a few times and SOHO is definitely one of those fav restaurant.  Their fish taste fresh as fresh! Lol amongst all though, I love the salmon carpaccio and amberjack with apple.   Tip: When you sit by the bar they give you little treats or surprises for you to try. Well at least when we sat by the bar for the 1st time, one of the chefs let us try 2 complimentary dishes! Wonderful!  Thanks guys! Keep it up!",

They apparently already had a large party booked at that time, so my reservation ended up being at 7:45pm. When my party and I arrived around 7:45-7:50, the hostess (Sheila) advised that our table isn't ready yet but the large group just ordered desserts, so it should be an additional 10-15 minutes wait. Well...we didn't get seated until 8:40pm-ish. We were starving, but we understood and did not get upset over it.   Sheila honored our group the $5 happy hour, which normally ends at 7pm. YASSS! After we ordered our food, Sheila and the food servers surprised us with a few plates of salmon and yellowtail sashimi, along with three (3) yoshinogawa sake bottles for our table. WOW! definitely did not expect that. Way to go above and beyond!   The sake was sweet, yet good. Hence I got drunk off of it! Sheila said that was the plan, because she didn't want us to remember the bad experience. hahah. I've been here a few times now, and this place has yet to disappoint me.   Thank you, Sheila and everyone else at Soho!",

We went around 6:45pm so we caught the HH just in time and opted to sit at the bar. There were so many options to choose from for a HH menu so we were quite surprised. I don't remember all of the things we got but the pics can do the talking! The yellowtail sashimi w/the gold edible flakes was the most memorable and prettiest dish there! There was an older couple next to us who ordered the omakase (sp?) and we thought the gold flakes on some of the nigiri pieces looked so pretty with how they presented the dish! I don't remember the name of the chef at the bar but he was the one who hooked us up with the yellowtail sashimi dish for us since we were first timers - thanks!!! Overall everything we ordered was pretty good, wished we had room for dessert but we'll deff try the next time we decide to go!",

They are the kindest, most efficient staff, and the food is delicious at a very affordable price. During happy house I can get quite a few selection for two at under $30. Come during lunch, and you can try their lunch specials or if you're lucky maybe score happy hour if no ones there. That's what I feel is so great about this restaurant. Their ethics and service show that they aren't here just to get the most money out of you, but to provide you with good service and delicious food! Love it here!",

We ordered Golden Ocean Trout, Garlic Soft Shell crab, Fire Cracker Roll, Rock shrimp tempura, and Tadas (octopus, tuna and salmon). There were modernistic, pallatable and heavenly. For dessert, we ordered the Green Tea Creme Brulee. I love how each plates were made with care and beautifully decorated.  Their local Sake and peach sake were pleasing.  The service was on par. They made sure you're doing fine. All young workers looks like they have great communication with each other and love what they do.  We sat at the bar and noticed the lovely sashimi plates going out, each beautifully decorated with unique style. There were regular customers as well. The prices are not inexpensive. The bill was like $94 for 2 of us. We will be back.",

Yes, it's a little out of the way, but it's a nice break from the craziness of the strip.  While I don't remember the specific name of what we ate (it was a special) the fish was fresh and melted in your mouth like butter. In fact, we did not need to chew any portion of our meal except for the sushi (barely!). We were seated right away with reservations, and the staff was so pleasant.  We ordered the Mio sparkling sake which went great with the seafood options. Everything including the fish and sake were affordably priced.  It's almost been a year and I still think about SoHo!",

My sister and I made a reservation at Soho for her birthday dinner, and we were sat at the bar for Omakase. Chef Tae took a great care of our dinner.   We had all their specials that were posted on the board, their unis and oysters were probably one of the freshest I have had in Vegas. They are totally worth whatever they charge you- even though we were charged only 1/3 of what we expected to be charged. They add black truffles and caviar to their sashimi dish, and other dish as well- which are probably the best quality and decoration you can find in any local area-and even strip.   I love trying different places, but I have not yet seen a Japanese restaurant that satisfied me more than Soho. This is totally a place that everyone should give a try.",

The quality of the sushi is great and the selection and innovative types of sushi is what keeps us coming back. The staff is friendly and I would trust them with any suggestions they offer. They also offer chef's specials that are not on the menu. I suggest asking the wait staff about these. You will be pleasantly surprised at any creations they have that are not on the menu.",

The dishes the chefs prepare are never dishes I'd select if the choice was up to me and I'm always amazed at how delicious each one is.  We always go in with a budget of around $50 each and there's always food left over at the end of the numerous courses brought out. I documented each course this year with a photo, because hey, the camera eats first!   I'll be sure to post the images shortly to the restaurant photos, if you're interested in seeing them. I'm from the Dallas/Fort Worth area and travel quite a bit. Omakase at Soho in Vegas is the best Sushi I've ever had, bar none. I salute you Soho, keep up the awesome!",

The food here has been consistently good the couple of times I've dined here with my wife but in terms of value for the money, it's not there.   When I leave similar Japanese restaurants and paying similar prices, other places have me going, \"Wow.  That was really good... AND I got my money's worth.\"   Not really the case here.    In addition, there has not been any 'stand out' dish for me.  The sake (salmon) and the hamachi were pretty good but they won't make you go \"DAMN!\" like Yonaka's sake orenji or Sakana's hamachi sashimi might make you involuntarily do.  Their oyster selection is pretty limited and more pricey than Other Mama's superior selection in both taste and price.    The free-range boneless grilled sliced chicken we had for dinner this time around was nowhere near as good as the short rib we've had in the past.  The chicken and the dipping sauce was fine and came with just a side of broccoli drizzled in ponzu sauce.  Strikingly a plain dish for such a well-rated restaurant.  I will give it to them that their service was quick and the food came almost as soon as we ordered.  With similar establishments doing what they do and better though, I think Soho needs to revisit their menu and step it up or else fall behind to some rising establishments.",

We were constantly on the hunt for a good happy hour that had good food, good drinks, and strong prices. One day, we stumbled upon this place. We actually ended up visiting three times during the three weeks we were in town!  The first time was just for happy hour. The food and drinks were great! Favorites were the carpaccio and the bronze broccoli.  The second time we went for someone's birthday. They recognized us from the first time and the birthday boy got a free dessert! The service was just as good as the first time, if not better! The third time however took the cake. There for another birthday, we were immediately welcomed with appetizers when we sat down. After we had ordered, they brought out a complimentary bottle of sake. The waiter explained the flavor and we cheersed for the birthday boy. When our food came out, the house actually gave us two plates of their specialty - yellowtail with ponzu and other garnishes. Amazing! The birthday boy also got a free dessert.  Yes the goodies were nice, but it really was the True prices, incredible hospitality, and quality of the food that made this place so special.  If you go here expecting special treatment and freebies, don't. We had really connected with the team since we ended up having repeat visits multiple times within a week and a half. If you go here expecting good food, good prices, and great service, then you won't be disappointed.",

The beer I had ordered was no longer available, but instead of the waitress just coming back and delivering unfortunate news, she had actually brought out a different beer that was comparable to the one I had ordered. She told me the chef had suggested this Kagua Rouge Belgian Strong Dark Ale and I went ahead and got it. The beer was delicious, had the hit of an IPA but replace the bitterness with a nice flowery taste.   The place is known for their tadas, which is basically for the lack of a better term, a toasted chip with your choice of tuna, shrimp etc. on top. These are delicious and cheap. There are a ton of other great dishes to sample. We tried the Cajun Albacore which had a bit of kick to it and the aioli was not too overpowering. They have some golden ocean trout and the kicker is that they include pop rocks on the bits of fish so it pops in your mouth. It was a bit of a novelty but still delicious and who is going to say no to pop rocks? We also had firecracker rolls and the volcano rolls and they were both delicious.  To top it all off, the waitress also brought us some of the yellow tail free of charge. I thought this was a nice compliment to the meal. She already had shown some great initiative with the beer compromise and now the place was offering us a free yellowtail.  I had heard that the chef really wanted everyone to be fully satisfied and you can see that mission throughout the restaurant. The service is swift and goes above and beyond. The food is delicious, presentation is excellent and the food menu is a bit innovative (pop rocks, tadas). This place is a definite must go.",

This particular time was a bit of a quasi disappointment. No knock on the food as the food was good but not worth the wait. We ordered from their omakase menu which had set items. We entered at 830 thinking their Yelp reservation confirmation at 845 was set. Come to find out it was not but they gladly seated us without delay anyway.  After ordering from their omakase menu (set menu) with additional items, the food came out at an average 18.75 minutes per dish. 8 omakase dishes totaling 2.5 hours. Normally this would not been an issue if it were our first time (no expectation) but unfortunately we been here before. To their defense the restaurant was at full capacity till 10 pm but half full at 10:15pm. We were the last to leave at 1130. We have done omakase at many places and this was very long. You tend to lose your appetite after awhile. Fortunately they broke their rule for providing us pitchers of beer. The beer had to make due for hungry patrons waiting 18.75 minutes per dish.",

Vegas folks can be pretty damn snobby when it comes to sushi (and food in general) because let's be honest -- this is one of the food capitals of the world and we have endless choices.   I've been here twice for lunch and the service has always been great and the food phenomenal. Their special is $8.95 for the \"typical\" dishes you'd find for lunch specials -- sushi, chicken teriyaki, salmon, etc -- HOWEVER, everything is just upgraded several notches.   The sushi is the freshest I've ever seen for the price and everything from the pickled salad to the green salad side dishes are just more tastier and fresh. And the price -- it's really a steal that I am super happy with.   Definitely a restaurant on my list to come back to.",

Chef/owner John Lee and his crew execute fresh, creative and sophisticated fare. The room is casual; the service is attentive and earnest. The food will make you feel like royalty. This is not one of those drab AYCE places, so don't expect heavy sauces, gummy sushi rolls or chewy fish.  There is amazing talent in the kitchen that has access to the finest ingredients often reserved for restaurants on The Strip. A lot of care is taken in their preparation to highlight the ideal characteristic of the fish. The flavors clean, refreshing, silky, complex and complementary. That fish cradles your palate and melts in your mouth.  Order what everyone else says: Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, Tuna Pizza, any of the Tostadas to your liking, Uni, Black Cod, Oysters, Snapper, Tuna Poke, Salmon Poke, Short Ribs. Take it all in. Ask what's good that day and just let them work their magic. You won't be disappointed (unless you're into heavy sauces, gummy rolls or chewy fish).  Once you've completed your indulging, you'll be equally delighted by your bill. C'mon, $2.00 tostadas! I don't need to go to the other sushi restaurant in the SW anymore. This is it.",

Very nice and comfortable family place with very attentive staff. My waitress probably re-filled my green tea 10 times while I was there. Always smiling and most importantly, often overlook in many busier restaurants, there are plenty of staff to help you with your needs.  The soft-shell crab roll was pretty good and the sashimi was fresh. For lunch, the portion is just right. I can't wait to return to sample their dinner menu.",

Their lunch prices are ridiculously low, and they might offer the best bento box deal in town.  (Although I don't believe they call it a bento.)  The dinner offering is much more diverse than lunch.  The food is instantly familiar, and the quality of product and preparation is of top-quality.  I can easily see myself taking friends from out of town here instead of bringing them to the strip.",

Friendly staff who were very attentive and polite.  The owner came over to chat and gave us a free sample of the yellowtail so that we would have tried the raw fish and got to see how fresh it was for ourselves.  Roommate and I both had some of the bento boxes on the lunch menu and can I say I was pleasantly surprised.  The beef terriyaki bento box was a good size, not too large or small, came with salad and miso soup and the beef wasn't over cooked.  In fact it was almost tataki style (very red in the center).  I loved it!   The sauce came on the side which was nice too because I don't like when the terriyaki is just slathered on, I find that lazy.  The yellowtail was in a yuzu sauce that was just divine, and since it was my first time trying yellowtail and I enjoyed it, I am now a fan of that fish.  I would highly recommend this place to locals and tourists alike.  And I will be taking my boyfriend/friends here on future trips to the area.  Thank you Soho for a wonderful experience.",

He came out to our table and greeted us, which to me it says a lot, asked what we liked and were then surprised with his signature Yellow Tail sashimi which was absolutely wonderful! It was so good we had to re-order it.  We also had the tuna poke which again was amazing! Hadn't had this quality of sushi and sashimi since San Francisco so to find this place closer to home is so nice.  Oh and the TOSTADAS! I really can't stop raving about these! They are small but so full of flavor and addicting that you won't be able to just have one! I recommend the Hamachi, tuna, and the salmon one.  Overall a great restaurant with great service but above all AMAZING QUALITY of FOOD! Will definitely drive 4hrs just to come eat here!",

    "text": "Julie was our waitress and she was stellar! Her suggestions for what we should order did not disappoint. We loved all the dishes that we ordered in the first round so much so that we ended up ordering three rounds of dishes!! If our stomachs could fit anymore food we probably would have ended up ordering at least one of everything on the menu.  What we loved about the food at Soho was that it was prepared well, not overly done with sauce and garnishes, and the most important part was that all the ingredients were fresh!   Another reason why we liked this restaurant was because it's super low key and relaxed but the food is something you would expect on the Strip in a fancy overpriced restaurant! The restaurant itself is not super fancy either, it's located in a stripmall next to an ice cream/boba place (which is also really good too). The restaurant is nice and clean. We came during lunch, midweek so we were able to get a table without any wait. We even enjoyed their selection of music playing in the background, stuff you'd listen to while hanging with your friends on a weekend.   All the staff was very nice and well versed in their menu.   Here's what we enjoyed: *All sashimi was super fresh! -Golden Ocean Trout sashimi: suggested by Julie, it was our first time trying this, which is pretty crazy because I love sashimi and feel like I've tried it all. This was awesome! -The Hamachi appetizer: I'm usually not a big fan of Yuzu but it definitely was not overpowering in the sauce -Fresh Scallops dish -Crispy Broccoli: One of our favorite dishes, so simple but executed well. We had to order this twice because it didn't stand a chance the first time -Miso bass: wish the portion was a bit larger because it was so good. We asked Julie beforehand and she let us know what to expect, that's why we ordered another dish. The fish was so tender and the miso was not overly sweet like some places can prepare it. -Short Rib: also super tender, the meat came right off of the bone.  -Dozen Fresh oysters: also prepared well, shucked nicely with a complimentary light drizzle of sauce on top  If we lived in the area we would definitely frequent this restaurant for sure. I had to give this place 5 stars because of it's overall value and quality.   Restrooms: Separate restrooms for men and women. Clean and stocked.",

On a Fri night, the place was packed, but after 30 mins of waiting, we got a table.   The waiter was a friendly kid from Hawaii, who was able to recommend some of the favorites and specials. We ended up ordering prob more that necessary for two of us.. but we wanted to try various dishes. Plus the prices were oh-so reasonable. lol  Yeah, those 5 stars are well-deserved !  Everything from oysters to sushi was super-fresh and delicious.  The food comes out pretty quick, but in orderly and timely manner so your table is not full of dishes uneaten.  We also got to talk to John (owner and chef) who is a very nice guy and definitely knows his sushi. We wish him and the staff the best.",

The $15 twin dragon roll is super delicious and filling. The service here is awesome, too. The executive chef and servers are super friendly. I'll definitely come again!!!",

The Firecracker roll was surprisingly bland given its jalapeno content and the other couple rolls we tried were just meh and we get way better sushi rolls at our regular place.  For that reason, this restaurant does not deserve to be the #1 restaurant on Yelp.    Everything else - WOW!  The quality and cuts of fish are excellent - you cannot go wrong with the sashimi.  The tostadas are a good little value at only $1 each during Happy Hour - the Salmon and Hamachi are the best ones and they taste awesome!  The mussels were very good and used uzo so they had a great citrus punch.  Don't skip dessert - we loved the matcha tiramasu because it was the perfect little size after we stuffed ourselves with sushi.  Even during Happy Hour, you will end up spending quite a bit of money.  The service also was only 3/5 on the night we went but they were quite busy and the people were pleasant just scattered about and not that attentive.  I enjoyed eating here but it did not blow my mind like Kabuto and it is also not as convenient and cheap as my regular place down the street from me.  Maybe if they rotate the selections on their Happy Hour menu I would go back, but probably not for any other reason.  We spent $60 per person and for a little more money I can go to Kabuto.",

The wait and cook staff were cleaning up without regards that customers were still present in the dining room. A girl (Asian, medium height and build) was singing/squealing at the top of her lungs and cursing  left and right. It was obviously a cry for attention from the sushi chefs. I'm pretty patient but after it continued for about 30 minutes I could not handle it any more. Casey, our server at the time, was great. He was polite and mild mannered. His energy did its best to offset that crazy lady. We tipped him 100% of the tab for saving our sanity.   Basically, it's hard for local restaurants to succeed when they are competing against big named chefs on the strip. Soho definitely has the food handled, but they could really invest in hiring a restaurant manager to ensure that the ambience is maintained (especially when a customer called to ensure that it is not too late to get proper service).",

    "text": "First time in a while I've seen a 5 star rating for a restaurant so I decided I should really try it out before having to go back to brutal wintertime Chicago.  I'm a business owner myself so first thing I noticed is from the outside the place doesn't look too impressive. Typically I would feel a bit iffy about going to a sushi joint in a strip mall, but I knew the reviews had to mean something and luckily the inside was much better. Nicely designed dining room and an open kitchen with a small sushi bar near the back. Overall the restaurant was a lot smaller than I had imagined.  Service 5/5 It was really good for a local restaurant, server was very helpful in making recommendations and asked how everything was multiple times and never had to ask for anything really. Im really critical when it comes to customer service since I have to yell at people for giving bad service on a daily basis and I couldn't find anything to nitpick. Our waitress was a Korean girl who spoke Korean to us so maybe I was a bit biased..  Food 5/5  We had 3 cold dishes. Trout with pop rocks (I know.. Wtf?) but it was surprisingly really good and the shit pops in yo MOUF  Some white fish I don't remember with soy ponzu sauce with deep fried Serrano chiles. This was my favorite cold dish.  And the Uni trio which unfortunately turned into the Uni duo because they were out of the Hokkaido uni (the best one damnit!) but the other two types from Cali were still fuckin good. It is Uni after all.  Also had soft shell crab warm dish which is deep fried soft shell crab on a ponzu dressing salad which was good as you could imagine.  Next we had the dragon roll? It was king crab tuna and avocado topped with shrimp tempura with a spicy sauce which was probably the best roll I've ever tasted in life.  THEN we got the sashimi lunch box and the chicken katsu lunch box which were both legit especially the chicken katsu, that was the crispiest thickest chicken katsu I've ever had.  All this was for me and my mom by the way which is absolutely absurd now that I'm actually typing what we ate.",

He had great recommendations on what to order and the best way to do it.   The happy hour menu is great! Lots of good stuff at great prices. Every piece of fish was fresh and well prepared. We did order some regular menu items and were not disappointed. Prices are very reasonable and again, high quality.   The only 2 things I didn't love were how cold it was in there (felt like AC was blowing) and they're a Pepsi place (personal preference- Coca Cola all the way :)  Go for happy hour and try it in for size!",

Walking in I am always quickly sat and they luckily have wifi and a place to plug in. It's becoming one of my go to spots to grab lunch while doing some work.   Service - Both times the service has been exceptional but this time the service is above par. The male server that I have the pleasure of serving me is not only friendly, but super funny, personable, and knowledgable.   Food - Fresh is definitely the name of the game. I typically eat sashimi so I always know if a place isn't getting in in regular. I even tried the Miso Black Cod and all I can say is Yummy!   Drinks - They only have beer/wine/sake but they have a fantastic bottle of Sparkling Sake for only $18 so it's perfect for me.   My overall view is that this is definitely an awesome place with fresh fish, great service, and a nice atmosphere. You can't go wrong here. Of course if you want 600 lame deep fried rolls then you might want to go down the road. If you want great food and great service, stop by SOHO for a great meal.",

First off, service was great & it was fun! Very attentive & on top of their game. So major kudos to them. Then, the food. This has to be one if the freshest tasting sushi I have had in a long time! Everything was great! Definitely you'll need to try from the cold menu & the traditional rolls.  Seriously, everything was GREAT & everyone was AWESOME!",

There is plenty of parking in the plaza, although some of it wasn't shaded. The dining area and restrooms were clean and well maintained.   We decided to start things off with a couple of appetizers. I highly recommend the Ahi tuna tostada ($1 during happy hour). The fish tasted very fresh and overall the crunchiness of it topped it off. All of the rolls and sashimi were all fresh and presented in a beautiful fashion. I highly recommend the yellow tail!   The service here was great. Our waitress was very kind and conversed with us about our upcoming weekend. We also got to meet the owner of the place and gave us a free bottle of sake! It was the best way to start off and epic weekend! Although it is a bit far from the strip, I will definitely go back to this place everytime I go to Vegas!",

Not only is the food amazing but the staff is incredible! Everything is reasonably priced and sooooo good.   Try the crispy a Brussel Spouts and Sunny Salmon Roll.  I also enjoy being able to ask the chefs to surprise me with something creative. Chef Aaron and Chef Tae make the best damn rolls everrrrrrrr. But honestly the whole staff makes every thing so perfect.   I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want my favorite spot to get busy! But they deserve every bit of business they get!   Honestly though if you want quality sushi at a great price. Go here!!!",

I mean so fresh I should be eating it wearing a snorkel and mask. I found it.  We made reservations for dinner which I would highly recommend. When we walked in four top was waiting for us and we were seated immediately. The staff recognized it was a birthday dinner and welcomed our first time visit.  Our server was Boris who is over the top with his service and demeanor. He walked us through the menu, made some great suggestions, he was attentive. A keeper.  I am writing this sated. Now to share the items we ordered.  We started off with the happy hour menu, which is a great value and then proceeded to the main menu  Infused Sake and Tyku Cucumber Sake 2 - Tempura Shrimp Rolls 2 - Shrimp Lollipops 1 - Baked Mussels 1 - Salmon Roll 1- Fire Cracker Roll 1 - Cajun Albacore sashimi 2 - Escolar Carpaccio 1 - Waygu platter 1 - Angus Sliders 2 - Salmon sashimi with avacado creme 1 - Golden Ocean Trout Sashimi - To die for 1 - Seared Garlic Tuna 1 - Amberjack Crudo 4 - Kumamoto Oysters 1 - Snapper with Uni and Roe (Not on the menu but you can ask for it)  All under $200 for 4 of us.  Everything was perfect and tasted so fresh. First time I tried Uni. Yay!  I have eaten at some of the most prestigious sushi restaurants on the strip. I have had Chef Nobu serve me personally. Chef John Chien Lee, formerly of Social House and the delicacies coming out of the kitchen was the best Japanese dining I have experienced in Las Vegas in 12 years. The bonus is not having to pay strip pricing for such a fine dining experience.",

Yes, it was plural. the group was pretty much the size of the entire restaurant. It is always great when you walk into a restaurant and people great you with a smile and open arms. Now, was this the staff or the new friends?   The menu for the specialties are different but great!!!There was soooo much food on the table that it was hard to pick a favorite. Just go into the restaurant blindly and pick and point in the section of specialties and say...that one. You cannot go wrong with any. Plus, the portions are well portioned enough to feed at least two people. Everything you eat almost just melts in your mouth. It has that soothing feeling...\"broke da mouth\" type of feeling.

Soho is always packed on my visits for dinner so I recommend reservations if you're in the mood for amazing Japanese cuisine.  Typical setup of a Japanese restaurant with a sushi bar that seats approximately 12 people within a main dining room of tables, Soho is located in the southwest corner of warm springs and jones blvd.  Must try dishes include the hydrobib cod which is cooked perfectly and a great starter along with sashimi dishes such as the yellowtail or salmon yuzu.  The chalkboard behind the sushi bar shows fresh specials of the day including crab legs, lobster tails and other items that might not be on the daily menu.  More adventurous patrons can try the grilled octopus accompanied by some potatoes and an interesting citrus based sauce.  Overall the quality and consistency of food keeps me coming back along with its family style vibe.  Soho rocks!",

A quick Lyft or Uber from the strip and here you are - a truly wonderful place with incredible quality, killer prices, and great service! $5 HH is where it's at, and you can make a reso via phone. Hint: Ask for the sushi bar! You can watch the magic happen and maybe even snag a complimentary bite of something delicious. My favorite item is the Spicy Tuna Dip - YUM. The chefs mentioned they recently did a big catering order for Elton John - and there's a reason that someone who travels all over the world and has access to ANYTHING would get food from these guys. It's fresh, creative, interesting, beautiful, and tasty. Wish I could give far more than 5 stars!",

I don't always want to trek to the strip for great sushi.   This is a great find! Great location, service was awesome, restaurant is clean, food was exactly what I was looking for!  When I went it happened to be happy hour which was a great accident!! It was super busy, we waited about 10 minuets before we were seated & the waitress was super nice & told us about the happy hour & that it was going to end soon (I think it only goes til 6, but I could be wrong) she came back quickly so we could get our order in before it ended & she can back to double check we didn't want anything else right before the happy hour ended. I really appreciated that- so many places don't do that & she really went above & beyond to make sure we were able to take advantage of the great deal.   I've been back a few times & it's always consistently great!!!",

We ordered Japanese and Santa Barbara Uni, the sashimi premium, spicy salmon roll, rock shrimp tempura, shrimp roll, kalbi, and two hot sakes. They ran out of the Japanese uni. The shrimp tempura batter was heavy, the rolls looked very loose and did not feel very fresh. The sashimi premium was big looking but just had a lot of ice and yet the fish didn't seem to be that cold. I'm not sure if the person handling it just has warm hands or the fish had been sitting out. I feel the pictures made everything look so good and so interesting and yet when we ordered it looked nothing like the images on Yelp!  I wouldn't recommend going here, especially since it is out of the way from the strip too.",

I was certainly part of that demographic, and was only drawn to Soho by their Happy Hour menu, which boasted over 30 small plates for $5 each, along with over a dozen drink specials.  With that many options, I also couldn't help wonder if it was one of those \"quantity over quality\" type of deals, but I had faith in the exceedingly positive Yelp reviews, which were absolutely on point!  A few Happy Hour dishes and infused sakes later, the other menu items started to look more and more enticing (who could resist the allure of Hokkaido uni?!). We ended up venturing beyond the HH menu, adding several nigiri sushi, Kumamoto oysters, and the Firefly Squid to our order. I'm all about trying new fish and got to try akamutsu (black sea perch) sushi for the first time!  Excellent food at reasonable prices, friendly and attentive service, plus a fantastic happy hour are all hallmarks of the Soho experience. I will definitely be returning on my next sojourn in Vegas.  TLDR: One of the best Happy Hours I've had, and the regular menu delivers some pretty solid sushi as well! Don't forget to make a reservation or be prepared to wait.",

    "text": "Some restaurants try and fail to pull off Asian fusion. Soho does it flawlessly. I'd give 6 out of 5 stars if I could.   My guy and I came by on a Saturday for Happy Hour -- offered Monday through Saturday from 3pm to 7pm. We arrived around 4:50pm and didn't have to wait. By the time 5:30pm rolled around, though, there were several groups of guests waiting for a table. Apparently, making a reservation is the way to go around here.   Right away, we knew we'd have a great meal. We arrived famished and fell in love with the dozens of options on the Happy Hour menu. Rolls, carpaccios, appetizers, and drinks are all up for grabs. All of the food items are $5 each -- and great sizes! -- and most of the drinks are $5 or $6.   A few things to keep in mind -- this is a place to go to if you genuinely like raw fish. A lot of the menu features raw items and creative garnishes, so this might not be the place to try something completely out of your element. Also, expect the sashimi slices in the carpaccios to be small and thin. Fresh, but skinny.   Lastly -- I have to say Soho has the best sauces ever. Seriously. You won't find basic ponzu, eel sauce, and spicy mayo junk at Soho. Instead, you'll enjoy the likes of Yuzu mascarpone creme, creamy ponzu, avocado creme, and truffle oil.   Here's what we ordered...  TROPICAL SAKE, PASSION FRUIT MANGO - $6 for a small-sized carafe.  - Sweet and fruity, just how I love it. No strong sake taste.  - Cold, alcoholic drink.   - Guava flavor is also available.  GINGER HAMACHI - Yellowtail with slices of jalapeno and fried pork rinds.  - Never had crispy pork rinds on raw fish, but I loved it. I've been missing out.  - Not on the happy hour menu.  - One of my favorites of the evening!  SALMON CARPACCIO - Features Yuzu mascarpone creme, shallots, and diced tomatoes.  - The flavor just works, and I was so weary of cheese and salmon.  - Fresh, light taste.  - So good, we got it twice.  - Another favorite of the evening.   ANGUS BEEF TATAKI - Seared steak with shallots, chives, garlic, olive oil, and ponzu.  - Tastes a lot like seared tuna tataki. Similar texture, too.  - Compared to everything else, this was the least memorable. Everything else we ordered was just so much better.   CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI - Comes on a bed of daikon radish, soaked in sauce.  - Creamy ponzu sauce is unlike anything I've ever had. So rich and flavorful.   SALMON AVOCADO CREME - Dressed up with avocado creme, pico de gallo, cilantro, and ponzu.  - The avocado is subtle, but offers an excellent sweetness to each bite.  - Cute take on ceviche.   SALMON AVOCADO ROLL - 8 good-sized pieces.  - Basic item, but yummy and filling because of the rice.  - Can't go wrong with a classic!  SPICY TUNA DIP - Basically, a spicy tuna tartare with taro chips instead of wonton chips.  - The spicy tuna is a legitimate tartare mix, not the average spicy tuna that goes in a roll. SO GOOD.   INFUSED COLD SAKE, WHITE PEACH - $5 for a small-sized carafe. - Stronger sake taste, but still a nice fruity flavor.  - Cold, alcoholic drink.  - Lychee flavor is also available.   BAKED MUSSELS - 6 large pieces.  - Yuzu dynamite sauce with ponzu, scallions, and tobiko.  - Great, easy option to share.   Overall, an excellent meal. My guy and I agree that this was the best Happy Hour experience we can remember.   Bonus -- ample parking, as the restaurant is situated in a plaza. Also, the employees are great and helpful. There's a dozen people working in the open kitchen, busy creating masterpieces and shouting \"Soho!\" at incoming patrons.   Whether you're a local or a tourist, come here!!",

Every single thing I've read and head is True. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!",

When the food finally came, the portions were small;food was over priced. The tempura was over fried. Rice did not come with it. It was not sushi rice...a little hard and dry. Sashimi was good but over priced. I've been to many Japanese restaurants, this one is definitely over rated on Yelp.",

If you go there for lunch try one of their awesome lunch specials for only $8.95! Each bento box comes with Miso soup with negi and tofu, green salad with a tangy and satisfying vinaigrette, choice of entree, and a side of steamed white rice. As for the sushi rolls, unbeatable quality! Fish is so fresh you can taste the difference. Another positive note is service. Our waitress Rachel was so attentive and helpful with tons of suggestions on what to try. When it came time for dessert, we were blown away by the Green Tea Tiramisu and Creme Brulee! So creamy and full of rich flavors. Soho is definitely worth all five stars.",

Not very crowded yet, which was good because we were famished, but not ready to just gorge. Looking for a delectable satisfaction vs. gluttony, which Vegas food seems to focus on. Greeted warmly and seated quickly. Received h20 quickly and given time to review menu, ask about specials, take a breath, and soak in ambience. Ordered spring roll, poke, spicy albacore, twin dragon roll and firecracker. All came out timely, without rush, fresh as can be. Owner/Chef John came over to greet us and thank us for coming. He sent over complimentary uni which was perfect.  No pressure to order alcohol, I just wasn't in the mood after a long drive, but will next time because prices were reasonable. Overall, great place to eat, perfect size, great mood, one flat screen on mute to check out the college fb game if you wanted to. I'll be back.",

We are from the Boston area and were in Vegas for a quick lay over and sought out sushi for the 1 night in town. Based on Yelp reviews we ventured out of the strip area and sat at the sushi bar at Soho. It was by far the BEST experience and sushi we have had in a very longtime. We were immediately greeted by many of the sushi chefs behind the bar. Their welcoming and obvious banter and laughs while they were working hard to keep up with the demand of the full house was infectious. Obviously the owner treats his staff with respect and it shows in the love they have in what they do, working right beside him.   We ordered a couple of rolls and Toro sushi which all blew us away. While chatting with one of the chefs he inquired what we were particularly fond of and moments after informing him that we both like spicy/jalepeno, raw fish type entrees and rolls we were presented with the most delicious complimentary hamachi that had been soaked in a garlic, with what tasted like a hot spicy sesame oil...delicious. We will definitely make it a point to go back anytime we are passing through Vegas and HIGHLY recommend you do the same.",

The thousands of extremely positive Yelp, Google+, and Tripadvisor reviews don't lie.  Its awesome!  Happy Hour is the shizzle, with over 30 different menu items available for just $5 each!  And, if you sit at the sushi bar, and its your first time there (as it was ours), they will give you a few freebie dishes as a way of saying \"thanks for coming, make sure it isn't your last visit!\"  My wife and I ate about $80 worth of amazing sushi and sashimi for $30 plus tip!  Believe me though, the food is so good, its worth it even when it isn't happy hour.   This is our new go-to off the Strip sushi in Vegas, supplanting the almost as good Sen of Japan.  Just go to SoHo.  You will not be disappointed!  FYI, if you have a car in Vegas, its less than 15 minutes from the corner of Harmon and LV Blvd by City Center and PH.",

I can't say Soho will make me go to my favorite sushi bars less but I may come back here on occasion.  We sat at the sushi bar which was awkward because you can't fit your legs under the bar. There is a slanted piece of wood that runs the whole length of the bar that prevents you from sliding your legs under.  The chairs are very big and comfy so that makes up for it.  It was also very cold at the sushi bar so bring a jacket or dress warm if you plan to sit there.  We were both dressed warm but we were freezing.   Our favorite was probably the lettuce wrapped cod-I forgot to take a pic.  Service was exceptional and attentive.  5/5    The prices 5/5 very reasonable for great quality and super fresh fish.   Not a 5 star rating because I am not dying to go back.  Usually when I eat somewhere exceptional I want to rush back within the next day or two.  I will return someday though to try more menu items and I especially want to sample the desserts.  Located next to the Chevron Station, behind Lucky's.",

We went to Nobu a couple nights ago and spent over $200 for 2 people and didn't order that much food and at Soho our bill was $35 during happy hour and we had so much food leftover. The entire staff is super friendly, attentive, and helpful. The yellowtail and mochi are especially delicious! I can't wait to come back here!",

I love their beef short ribs for dinner, it was tender, juicy and flavorful. The potatoes that came with it was yummy too. We also ordered a few sashimi plates.

When bill came my husband thought they made a mistake - very reasonable $ - and we even ordered a few things from regular menu.  My very favorite was the ika geso - like the traditional octopus grilled on stick, but with a very light and crispy batter. I thought the Diablo Loco was a winner!",

However no matter where I sit in the Restaurant I never feel any breeze from any A/C vent. They also have 4 or 5 fans going so I know other people must have complained about the heat also.

The Miso Cod is amazing and always fresh. They have their own signature tuna spice which is a mix of Cajun and some other great spices. The owner and chefs take great pride in the product they serve to their customers here. They do not serve any fish with a sheen or shininess to it. I never fear when I go hear that I may get sick. I feel great every time I leave Soho which is always a good sign when going to eat sushi. We are against going to all you can eat sushi because those places don't serve the best quality sushi. Another great sign is that they do not serve bay scallops which are super cheap. They serve the good sea scallops and they actually aren't crazy expensive for this my wife orders the umami scallop hand roll which is only $5 probably one of the cheapest items on the menu and most places charge $7-8 and they are most commonly bay scallops which are less expensive and have a fishy taste normally with more sand grit in them. The scallops they have here are silky smooth. I cannot stress enough this place again is some of the best sushi you will eat. I compare them to Nobu at half the price and possibly more creative with some of their menu items.",

They were all interesting, fresh fish, and a good blend of flavors. We tried to pick a favorite but really couldn't. In spite of being quite full of sushi, we were convinced to try the dessert. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the green tea tiramisu was wonderful--nicely flavored, not overly sweet, and the perfect end to a delicious meal.",

Quick and easygoing service, great happy hour prices (Mon-Sat 4-6pm) and great food. We had the Soho Maki, Salmon Avocado Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Firecracker Roll, and the Baked Mussels. Everything was perfect.   The Soho Maki is like a long and thin eggroll, $3 for 3 of them. They also come with a very delicious sweet chili sauce.   The Salmon Avocado Roll was pretty good, also goes great with the sweet chili sauce from the Soho Maki, but I personally think there was a bit too much avocado in it and it made it just a bit greasier than it should be, but it was still great.   The Spicy Tuna Roll was good, really no complaints, I love how spicy it was, not too spicy, but just right.  Now, the Firecracker Roll. What can I say, amazing presentation and the flavors just explode in your mouth. I loved it and it was definately worth the Happy Hour price (not that the others aren't worth it).   Finally, the Baked Mussels. I hadn't had mussles in at least 9 years, and Soho really delivered. They were delicious and cooked perfectly.   Also, the owner came up to us during the meal and introduced himself, and at the end of the meal we got a free dessert (I dont know what it's called, like icecream wrapped in dough, delicious). And he also gave my little brother (6) a chop-sticks helper thingy. Very friendly owner, and he is an excellent chef.  All in all, everything was great, final bill came to ~$22.00 for everything. I live a block away and it's a great neighborhood place. Must check out if you live in SW Las Vegas.",

Chef John Lee and his wife Michelle own the place and they are the nicest people you will ever meet! They really make you feel like family here and go above and beyond to make you feel at home and welcomed. The atmosphere is cozy and if you get Charles as a server you are definitely winning here! Charles is a people pleaser, fun, and is very knowledgable with the menu. Ask for Charles! Great job John Lee, I wish you many years of success!!",

Once your seated the staff is really friendly and knowledgeable about food recommendations. Everything we tried was really good but the best dish has to be the cod fish. I'm a sushi lover and by far this is the best place.",

We tried just about everything on the menu and everything that everyone suggested.  You really can't go wrong with anything.  Even things I would never eat, I tried and LOVED.  3 days later, I'm still craving more as well as ranting and raving to friends. After ordering about 20 rolls for the handful of us, we proceeded on to the dessert which we had no room for but I sure am happy I took advantage of this experience.  Beyond amazing and I suggest everyone go.    Not only is the food great, but service was outstanding as well.",

The green tea - to start and to finish - was exceptional because they put a bit of toasted brown rice in it which gives it a nice nutty flavor (and makes it brown so don't be surprised when your green tea isn't green). We had the poke tada (small plate) to start, then the spicy albacore tuna roll which was so well-presented and tasted great. The habanero sauce wasn't overpowering but you may want it on the side, like we did.",

It was funny because my group looked surprised that I picked this place out ( looks so whatever, not fancy at all), but after few bites, they all agreeed that this was the best japanese place ( one of them eats the best places in NYC, and all over the USA due to her job)... quality of their sushi is just TOPTOPTOP notch.

The firecracker roll is a favorite, but everything is executed very well.  TOSTADAS: Tako is slightly spicy, salmon is delicious, Hamachi was on the plain side, tuna poke was the best. $1 each HH, regularly $2/ea. HYDROBIB BLACK COD: delicate but flavorful, loved the soft texture of the fish contrasting with the fresh crunch of the lettuce. FIRECRACKER ROLL: a favorite roll! Packs a nice punch of heat with spicy tuna and jalapeno, cools it down with a minimal amount of cream cheese and great texture and flavor of sweet onion. Unique! SALMON AVOCADO ROLL: simple and delicious CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI: BF's favorite, good-sized portion with a lot of sauce, served on a bed of crunchy radish. IKA GESO: Tasty surprise! A bar-food take on fried squid with a dust of spice, served with a curry mustard sauce. The sauce makes it! BAKED MUSSELS: Large, tender, and saucy.  Added the server's recommendation, YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI, their \"signature dish\". It was good, with generous slices of fish and light but flavorful garlic-ponzu, but not something I haven't had elsewhere.  Ultimately, I came here due to the Yonaka comparisons and was pleased with the fish quality and the great flavors but feel the menu is mostly great quality versions of common sushi staples- would love to see them add some more unique or inventive dishes, like the ika gesso. Will be back for the Firecracker roll, would love to meet Chef John on my next visit!",

This was our first dinner outing when we arrived to Vegas, and it really set our standards high for the remainder of our trip. The level of service and food at Soho was hard to beat. And let me tell you! The girls and I eat sushi very regularly, so I'd like to think it says a lot that Soho was a favorite!  The food is just as amazing as their service (if not more). The rice around the rolls was perfectly portioned - not too much, not too little; the sushi/sashimi was superb and fresh; and they had mouthwatering uni oysters that the girls loved! To top it all off, our server gave us a free large bottle of sake and dessert to congratulate me on my engagement :')  Thanks to Soho, we had a memorable time and I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "I rarely go to the same restaurant twice a month, and going to one twice a week is unheard of, but I loved SoHo Japanese Restaurant so much that I went two consecutive days in a row - I would have gone for three, but we were already on our way back to LA!    During both visits we took advantage of their happy hour offerings and were blown away by the taste, generous portion, and inexpensive how bill ended up being. Honestly, it doesn't get any better than this. Below were the items we sampled.   **Note*** Items listed were from two separate dinning experiences, but some items ordered did overlap          HAPPY HOUR MENU (4pm-6pm) -Cajun Albacore Sashimi ($5): Thin sashimi slices with a mayo based sauce is a great way to start your meal.      -Ika Geso ($4): Calamari accompanied with a flavorful yellow curry sauce. It was cooked perfectly unlike many restaurants that tend to over-fry theirs. Definitely a worthy order.   -Salmon Avocado Roll ($4): Chef John was incredibly generous with the amount of salmon he stuffed into these rolls and get this... you get 8 pieces. Seriously? That's like $.50 per piece. And no it's not anything like gas station sushi, this is high quality fatty salmon that just melts in your mouth. Excellent - we actually ordered two servings (on both visits), and we'll definitely order this again and again in the future   -Hydro Bibb Black Cod ($4): I'd like to think of this as a Japanese Fish Taco with the Bibb Lettuce acting as the tortilla and the grilled black cod as the protein. The fish just melts in your mouth, it's soooo good. Two thumbs up!     -Tada Salmon ($1): Guacomole, salsa, and salmon over a flat chip. It was good, but I think you'd be better off ordering the Salmon Avocado Roll.    -Baked Mussels ($5): Also good, but to be honest I can't remember much about it.      REGULAR MENU  -Golden Ocean Trout with Pop Rocks($11): It's like a full blown party in your mouth. So if you're fearless this is your ticket to super stardom and the salmon was so fatty and delicious. Love!      -Flying Fish Roll ($15) - This was a simple tuna and salmon over sushi. The presentation was modern and taste was solid.    -Uni Duo w/ Santa Barbara and Catalina ($20): To be honest, I am a novice when it comes to uni. I really liked the Santa Barbara, but I couldn't say the same for the Catalina. The Catalina is a bit more gritty, whereas the Santa Barbara was much smoother. Nevertheless, both were very fresh.   -Kumoto Oyster wiyh uni ($6): Hands down the best dish of the night. The oysters were so incredibly juicy without tasting fishy and combined with the roe and uni - it was magical. I'm at a loss for words. Just order it!    SUMMARY Food execution was spot on, service was great, and prices- OMG, I still can't believe the bill. About $50 (not including tip on each visit) for two patrons at a nice Japanese joint with high quality fish. Completely Un-heard-off...    Soho has now become my favorite place to dine in Sin City and on every trip from this point on, it'll always be on the Vegas itinerary. Thanks Chef John for the wonderful memories and delicious food.",

Then came the mixed seafood tostada and soft shell crab roll. These were good also but not as good as the first three items we ordered.    We were very happy with the choices but we look forward to trying other options in the menu next time we are in town.",

The seafood is such good quality! It's very fresh! I've been here two times and I really loved the cold dishes. I've had the Seared Garlic Tuna, Salmon Avocado Creme, and Tuna Tataki with truffle oil (Which they took off the menu! Please bring it back!!!). Each dish has it's own unique flavor so I can't really say which one tastes better because they're that good!  The second time I went a friend and I ordered the Premium Sashimi plate which came with 20 pieces. Like I said.. the fish is very fresh! I used to dislike Uni.. I've had it had other sushi restaurants, but after trying it here, it's safe to say that I love it now!  Also shout it to Charlei our server! She was so friendly and always on point. Even gave me a sushi pen because she found out it was my birthday!",

Got off work early on Friday and with no solid dinner plans, I told my husband I wanted to try Soho's HH. It lived up to the hype, the service and quality of food was top notch. Our server Julie was very knowledgeable, giving us the background of the place, its specialties and dishes and Chef John. Although I've read here on Yelp most of the info that she's given, it was very much appreciated that she took the time to go above and beyond.   The dishes that we tried were deliciously satisfying and melt in your mouth goodness, it's nice to know you can go to a place and have 5 star quality without the price. We ordered all the tadas and of which I liked the tuna and octopus the most. The firecracker roll was a favorite as well but the star was definitely the yellow tail sashimi with yuzu soy that Chef John sent for us to try, it was so fresh and flavorful and melted like butter. I wanted to order more but I was stuffed and wanted to save room for dessert. We got the green tea tiramisu and green tea creme brulee, both heavenly but the creme brulee stole my heart. No doubt we will be back to try everything else on their menu. Kudos to Chef John and staff for doing such a great job!",

We ordered with our eyes rather than our stomachs and couldn't finish.   The Alaskan King Crab tempura was too greasy and had too much batter. The batter was just so overwhelming, I couldn't taste the crab! I had one piece and let my friend eat the rest.   We ordered a sashimi appetizer of snapper topped w/ uni. Extremely fresh and very tasty.  Also ordered the 12 pc sashimi and everything was fresh.   I was a fan of the spicy tuna w/ crispy rice roll, but my friend said he found it to be too dry. My only quip with it was that it's hard to eat and falls apart immediately, boo!   We had 2 rolls that I can't recall.. but they were just ok.  The hamachi kama was also just ok. I felt it could've been grilled a bit longer, and I didn't like the dipping sauce. Normally, the sauce that comes on the side is just ponzu  but theirs tasted like something is added to it.   We got the matcha tiramisu and I honestly felt we could've done without that too.",

It was obvious that every chef genuinely cared about our enjoying the food. Service from the wait staff was also quick and smooth, bringing our drinks quickly and clearing dishes as soon as we finished. Thank you, Soho, and another shoutout to Pedro!

    "text": "This is my first attempt at writing a yelp review so please bear with me!   I don't have an explanation as to why I haven't been to SoHo sooner, being that I only live about 10 minutes away and have had multiple friends say with conviction that they won't hang out with me until I do. I'm also a huge sushi/sashimi/Japanese cuisine fanatic so I'm almost glad there was an hour and a half wait at Goyemon (my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant), which factored in my decision to try out SoHo instead. When we arrived on a Saturday evening around 6:30PM, they told us the wait would be about 45 minutes but 30 minutes later, we were able to sit at the sushi bar, which is where I prefer to sit anyway. So, \"Yay!\" for the actual wait time being shorter than the anticipated wait time.   When you first pull up to SoHo, hidden by a gas station, you might think that you're just pulling up to an average sushi joint but they prove that looks can be deceiving. The venue isn't too large, but I think that's a positive for local, off-the-strip sushi restaurants. So don't judge this book by its cover!  After being seated at the bar, we were greeted by a very enthusiastic, outgoing server. After telling him my drink of choice is either good beer or whiskey, he recommended a light, sparkling cold sake. I was surprisingly happy with this suggestion since it wasn't too sweet and was very, VERY easy-drinking. Chef John, the executive chef and owner was behind the bar and that was a huge plus. You can tell he truly cares about his restaurant and his passion for this Japanese artwork is present throughout your dining experience. I heard that he used to be the Executive Chef of Social House at Crystals so I'm guessing that may have inspired the name, \"SoHo\". I could be wrong though so feel free to tell me if I am.   If you're looking for AYCE, this isn't your spot, but worth the extra bucks for a la carte sushi. SoHo features fresh specialty fish like Striped jack with a mild flavor, but firmer, amazing texture, similar to amberjack or yellowtail. And they had the freshest uni I've seen in Vegas. I've tried uni (Sea Urchin) before and wasn't very fond but I'm assuming that's because I've never had properly prepared/fresh uni. When I had it at SoHo, I found a new must-have! If the uni looks like a firm tongue, that's when you know you've gotta try it! When you bite into it, it reminds me of biting into raw liver, as far as texture goes. Maybe, it's a \"Hawaii\" thing, but I LOVED it. Chef John also brought out the exceptional Hokkaido uni straight from Japan. It was life-changing and the presentation was strip-worthy. It made me kind of wish I was on a date rather than a friendly lunch with a girlfriend (Sorry Tiff :P). We also tried their Kumamoto oysters - real Kumamoto oysters. The shells were about the size of a dollar coin (random, but the only thing I could compare the size to) and were pretty deep with a nice, plump oyster. The texture was perfect and partnered with their light house-made mignonette, forcing the sweet flavor of the oyster to come out and say, \"Hi!\". Other must-haves are the yellowtail yuzu soy (I'm a yuzu-whore) and the truffle white fish (I'm also a truffle-whore). In total, our bill was about $100 for the two of us, which is awesome! They also included a complimentary little green tea latte hard candy for each of us, which is always a nice gesture, especially for whoo-girls or yay-girls (if you have one of these as your girlfriend, you know what I'm talking about).   Stay classy Las Vegas & thanks for stopping by.",

We ordered the 20 piece sashimi with a side of sushi rice. We also ordered the pop rock ocean trout, which was True to its name! With the 20 piece sashimi, you can also add in lobster sashimi and a lobster side dish for an additional cost.   We will need to go back for their happy hour menu!",

Things we had that I would definitely recommend we're  Surf and turf roll Salmon carpaccio  Spicy tuna carpaccio  Beef carpaccio   They even hooked up my baby with fries and chicken katsu.   Service was really good and quality of food even better. Definitely worth the trip if you're visiting and looking to get off the strip.",

I am definitely coming back here (for happy hour.....because I am a poor poor grad student). Their fish is fresh; and the price is amazing.  I went with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday early. We went around 4:30PM for happy hour, and I was surprised that there was a pretty big crowd already. It seems that you can make reservations during happy hour, so I will definitely place a reservation next time. They asked us if it'd be okay to seat us at the sushi bar, and we said okay. AND THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER. Thank you Soho for my memorable birthday dinner!  I wish I got the chef's name, but my bad. He handed us our wasabi/ginger right after we sat down. We also ordered directly with him; for the drinks, we ordered with the waitress. Since every dish on the happy hour menu was 5 bucks, we kind of went crazy with ordering. I don't usually like talking to the chefs because I'm awkward, but he stroke up a convo with us, and I'm glad I responded. He found out it was our first time there/we were there celebrating for my birthday.  Halfway through our meal, he gave us a yuzu yellowtail dish on the house just because it was our first time there. It was such a nice gesture. When we asked for the check, it took them longer than usual because they were prepping a complimentary dessert for my birthday. The whole staff sang to me as they placed the dish in front of me. I think I'm especially touched because even though I was just ordering off the happy hour menu, Soho did not skimp on the customer service.   Food wise, at least on the happy hour menu, the fusion foods are where it's at. The best things we had definitely were the tostadas. They're kind of like a poke/ceviche mix that you eat with fried wonton chips. It was awesome. My boyfriend also loved all of the sashimi with sauces. (He has a thing for ponzu though) The JPOP alcoholic drink was sooooo good; it was just like drinking a soda, and I like sweet/fruity drinks. The karage was just okay--but for 5 bucks, I'm not complaining.  TL;DR Go for happy hour. Sit at the sushi bar. Leave happy.",

Although SoHo isn't AYCE, they do have lunch specials and an amazing happy hour with items that start at $5. That can't be beat! :)  The ambiance is amazing. It is nicely decorated and the staff is amazingly welcoming, efficient and fun!  I do not think that I have tried anything that I do not like but my top choice are: 1.) Flying Fish Roll 2.) Yellow in Yuzu Ponzu Sauce 3.) Salmon Kama  The quality of the fish is way better than the other AYCE restaurants that I have tried so I do not mind paying a little extra but not too much extra like Nobu prices.

I am a bit wary of sushi in Vegas, so I used Yelp to find a place and this happened to be just around the corner from my friend's apartment.   Decor inside was very modern. There was a decent amount of seating, but not really that great for large parties. We were a group of 5 and it took about 10 minutes  for them to figure out how to accommodate us despite having a half empty restaurant.   What I got to try:   Sunny salmon roll - delicious! Garlic edamame - very flavorful, and slightly spicy  Ceviche - soooo freaking good... The Mexican-Asian fusion was on point for this dish  Volcano roll - I didn't realize this was going to be deep fried. I'm not a big fan of deep fried sushi but it wasn't bad.   Service was friendly but food came out pretty haphazardly. My food took the longest, but it was worth the wait.",

The house salad was good!  Comes with the lunch specials, and I think a yuzu dressing if I remember correctly...ate up every bite!  The miso soup was just ok.  We supplemented our lunch with the Yellowtail Sashimi ($10): Tempura Jalapeno, Micro Cilantro, Garlic Oil & Yuzu Soy. This was very good, fresh, and tasted great with the slight citrus flavor from the yuzu. Recommended!  Also tried the Ocean Trout....outstanding! Had micro pop rocks for a fun consistency, and the yuzu soy really works well with this fatty / buttery fish. Highly recommended!!  I'd come back JUST for this dish!  Go during lunch for some very reasonable prices on some of the better quality sushi I've had in town :)",

    "text": "My friends & I came here for their happy hour (looks like they added an extra day.. before it was Monday through Saturday, now it's everyday: 4PM-6PM) & got a decent amount of food.   We had the white peach & lychee sake. You can easily share this.. each glass of sake filled 4-6 of the shot glasses. I recommend the white peach sake - it was infused really well! The lychee sake was good too.. but I didn't like that you could taste the sake more than the lychee.  During happy hour, we also had ika geso (fried squid tentacles), cajun albacore sashimi, avacado & salmon roll, firecracker roll (didnt try this one.. I can't do spicy :(), shrimp tempura roll & the tostadas!  Oh man, the tostadas were delicious!! There are four options:  - Salmon with pico de gallo  - Tuna with poke sauce - Hamachi with salsa verde  - Tako with kimchee  We tried all but the tako. The tostadas are $1 each during HH.. we loved these! They are very light, refreshing & we kept ordering them!! Haha.. eat these right away! Otherwise the chip will get soggy..  Halfway through our visit, the owner came by our table and asked us how we were doing & just chatted with us. He told us he was going to send us a plate of yellowtail sashimi which will show us what they're all about: fresh, high quality sushi! & they nailed it! The yellowtail sashimi was a great example of that: fresh + high quality = delicious!!  Throughout our time at Soho, the wait staff was really attentive.. refilled our glasses, asked how the sake & sushi were & the waitress came by before happy hour ended to see if we wanted to put in more orders. We had to pass on dessert because we were all full, but we still got something sweet! Our waiter brought this cute tray of sushi keychains & we could take our pick! It may seem like a small gesture, but it was SO nice!  This was one of the best experiences I have had in awhile from beginning to end! My friends & I left with big smiles on our faces.. I can't wait to go back & try more food!",

    "text": "Hands down, the best sushi I have had in Vegas. Extremely creative offerings coupled with a pleasant, open space and great service. I especially loved the Ocean Trout (Steelhead) Sashimi with pop rocks. We ordered it for the novelty of the menu description, but it was the stand out of our meal. Everything was wonderful. Chef Lee (formally of Social House) came by our table and spent some time with us, inquiring about our impressions of his restaurant and our preferences. He challenged us on Uni, probably the one sushi/sashimi component that I generally do not like. He generously introduced us to the EXTREMELY fresh Santa Catalina and other Uni that he selects. I have to say that even though I am not a Uni fan, I now think my hesitancy on Uni has been the fact that it is rarely presented as fresh and clean as what Soho offers.   We explored the rest of this eclectic menu and every selection was outstanding. We finished up on a short ribs dish that put us over the top. Every minute of our meal was a favor fest. We can hardly wait until our next trip to Vegas to return to Soho.",

From the kalbi ribs to their Cajun albacore sashimi, everything was so addicting. Can't get enough of their food!  Not to mention their fresh oysters, yuzu yellowtail is just so amazing!  This place never disappoints. I will definitely keep coming back!",

    "text": "A couple friends and I met up for Happy Hour yesterday and were very pleased with the food and amazing hospitality!  We focused on the Happy Hour menu which was simple since there were so many wonderful items on it! The prices made it even sweeter (everything ranged from $1-5).   I'm a big fan of fruit-flavored cold sake, so I was immediately drawn to their Soho Infused Sake with Lychee and White Peach options. A small carafe was just $4 (reg. $8) and enough for 6-7 shots. I was floored by the amazing deal and it is delicious. You could tell that it was made in-house with a natural flavor and light sweetness. We tried both flavors and White Peach was chosen as the favorite.  We tried a couple sushi rolls: Firecracker Roll ($8, H/H $5) which has spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried; Shrimp Tempura Roll ($6; H/H $4) with avocado and cucumber; and Salmon Avocado Roll (H/H $4). I didn't really care for the Firecracker Roll, but I also didn't realize it was fried (I'm not a fan of deep fried rolls or cream cheese in my sushi - fail on my part for not checking descriptions). The other two were fine, but really nothing special.  Other appetizers: Ika Geso (H/H $4) and Cajun Albacore Sashimi ($11, H/H $5) served with Serrano chili, red onion, ponzu aioli, and spicy garlic ponzu on a bed of julienned radish. Both delicious!  \"SOHO Tadas\" (Tostadas) are $2/each (except the Beef Tostadas) and during Happy Hour, the Salmon, Tuna, Hamachi, and Tako are just $1/each. A thin \"tostada\" crisp is topped with avocado creme and micro cilantro before being packed with delicious raw seafood. The Salmon is served with pico de gallo, the Tuna is made with Hawaiian poke sauce, the Hamachi is tossed in a salsa verde, and the Tako is served \"kimchee\" style (tossed in chojujang). All of them were delicious and refreshing. I love the variations of flavors and I think it is an amazing value for the amount of quality seafood! These are a must for your meal. I can't wait to try the beef, white fish, and shrimp ones!  Mr. Lee (owner and former executive chef of Social House at The Crystals) was so kind to welcome us (since it was all our first time), chat for a bit, and offer us a complimentary tasting of their signature dish! The Yellowtail Sashimi ($12) served with Tempura Serrano, micro cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust was absolutely delicious.   The whole night pretty much went like that. Amazing service from several servers in the form of constant water refills, attentiveness, and just all-around kindness. I asked the server for a pen when I realized the one I keep in my purse had died and instead of just allowing me to borrow one, I was given a SOHO-branded pen! Then, as we were preparing to leave, the same server presented a plate of adorable sushi key rings and phone charms!! What restaurant gives keyrings to their patrons?! Just, wow. Everyone was so, so nice to us! We couldn't stop talking about it even as we exited the restaurant!",

    "text": "Japanese restaurant, Chinese chef.  Vegas style.    Imagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined, pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.  Small selection of relatively fresh, everyday seafood.  The sushi, AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.  Two standout \"raw\" fish dishes, the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy, drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapenos and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.  Also noteworthy, the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde, salmon with pico de gallo, and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.  Nobuesque tempura (rock shrimp, king crab, assorted veg and shrimp), all not oily but over battered, masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso, yuzu aioli..  Finally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.  Friendly, off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.  It's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby.",

The staff was quick, helpful, friendly and didn't make us feel rush.  I asked for garlic edamame but instead received some variation of edamame with a really good tangy sauce, definitely wasn't garlic but was really good and the edamame coding was a nice treat.  Was hoping for a fried lobster roll, sadly they didn't serve lobster but instead the waiter recommended a jalapeno roll with crab and cream cheese. Was definitely good and different.  The spicy mayo was a bit off but otherwise good.  If you go for lunch, would definitely recommend the lunch special, really amazing deal.  Overall, one of the better sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, will definitely go back.",

    "text": "So I came to see the hype for myself, with over 500 reviewers and FIVE stars. That's almost unheard of.   Their service definitely deserves the five stars. They apparently have an excellent happy hour, for which I came about 30 minutes before it was ending. Our hostess said our table would be done in 20 minutes, which it didn't so she said that if it goes past the 6PM mark, she'd let the server know to still give us some time to order some happy hour dishes.   Most of the food was pretty good. I had a whole variety of things. The stuff on their HH is pretty standard, nothing too special, like spicy tuna roll, salmon avocado roll, and this cajun seared ahi. Nothing too 5 star worthy, but still well made and pretty standard. Also ordered the mixed sashimi platter. Some of those cuts were pretty darn good. The scallop was sweet and fresh. Their salmon was nice and fatty. Their fish roe has a seaweed bite which made it taste great. I'm not a fan of some of the other cuts, like red snapper, but they were still enjoyable. Also had their warm octopus salad or something..that's not something I'd recommend to anybody. I like octopus but not only was it good, the flavors didn't match with anything else on that menu that we had ordered. It was very off.  I didn't get to try their Omakase, but what we ordered was pretty good, so I think I will come back and try that one day. Overall, general sashimi cuts were pretty good, but their other happy hour stuff--it's a good deal for HH, wouldn't order them normally. Service is great. I'd recommend this place, probably not for happy hour though.",

We didn't know what to order so Charles and the chef asked us if they could create a tasting menu for us. We trusted them and told them yes!!! OH DEAR!!!! It was incredible!!!!! The yellowtail was amazing!!!! I've never had uni and never thought I would like it until now! The chef brought out some pieces and after one bite, I could die happy. (I exaggerate a lot! Hehe!)

We were so curious, we needed to try it, We also thought its almost 7 pm and this is a 5 star restaurant then there is going to be a wait. We got there and parked and there was no line outside.  I told my husband it must be closed.  Nope it was open- of course it would be its Saturday! There were a few tables opened and we got seated right away! Charles was our server! He was great explaining the menu and making his recommendations.  He was right, everything on the menu is good! This is our new favorite place! Fish is fresh- its so fresh it just melts in your mouth! You forget what fresh fish tastes like when you eat at AYCE restaurants! No more AYCE for us!   Salmon Wasabi Creme-hmm! So good! My favorite! Salmon is cut sashimi style, the roe gives it a salty taste, the creme gives a creamy taste! I'm addicted!   Tadas- only $2 each! We enjoyed the octopus, hamachi and tuna.  All 3 were mixed with their sauce and placed on a wonton wrapper.  Good portion considering it was $2 each!   Bone in Short Rib- if you are looking for a heavy dish then this was a good one to enjoy. The runner was right when she delivered the food as I was eating with my chopstick, do you need a fork and knife?, I said hmm. Then she said it falls right off when you eat it with your chopstick.  She was right no knife needed. It was so soft! The crispy onions made it more flavorful  Whole Aji- like sashimi style raw fish? This is a winner! I don't normally eat aji but I will here! It was another one of my favorite (surprisingly).  I don't even eat this at other sushi restaurants, but here, hmm, SO GOOD!   Triple uni- it was a special on the board! I don't eat this but I will tell you what he said best uni ever! Be prepares there is no rice!   There is so much more we need to try! We are so happy we found this place! This is hands down one of the best on the southwest side! We are definitely coming back! Thank you everyone for helping us find a good restaurant to celebrate my husbands birthday! Everyone's review was spot on!",

    "text": "This is quite possibly the best Japanese restaurant I've ever experienced. The chef/owner used to be the executive chef at Social House in Treasure Island and I'm assuming he kept all his connections because the fish quality is on par with the world class sushi joints on The Strip, but you're paying normal prices.   A few things are worth highlighting as to why this place deserves nothing less than 5-stars:  First, Chef Lee is incredibly passionate about the experience. If he has the bandwidth, he'll personally visit every table in the place just to find out how you're enjoying the food. I've never seen another chef do this as frequently or with as much enthusiasm. Also, he'll take note of commonalities amongst your orders and make recommendations for other dishes he thinks you will like. His recommendations to us have all been things we've never heard of, like engawa and sawagani, but have been soooo good and worth ordering again.   Second, in case you glossed over it above, the quality of his fish is on par with the best restaurants in town. Further, he designed the menu to include unique dishes you won't find anywhere else, such as the tostadas. Ask him about his specials if you want to get your hands on the one-off buys that he doesn't list on the menu.  Finally, SoHo won't break the bank. If you go all out for dinner, you may spend $50 per person (not including alcohol), but we usually end up around $35 per person. If you go there for lunch, you can get an entire meal for $8.50. Pretty awesome.  If you're a fan of Japanese food or just like trying new places, you would be out of your mind not to give SoHo a try.",

This small, yet very homey eatery, captures the feel of higher end locations, and actually kicks their butt in the menu department.   The service was great, I almost felt like a VIP. Starting with the lady who greeted us, to our very knowledgeable waiter Darrell, and the sweet lady assisting him, we got the royal treatment, and were quite impressed with the fabulous selections they recommended. Talk to Darrell and let him tell you what's up, we did and were quite happy.   When one considers where this really is, it is even more amazing; not on the strip or in some high end casino, but in a small strip mall out in the desert. The values are here, but you can also step things up a notch or two if that is your party's desire. Nice place!",

I have tried the shrimp, hamachi and tako ones too but I think the ahi is the best  And you cannot forget the hydro bib black cod is just amazing!! Best lettuce cup you'll ever have! Trust!   Some of the other things I've tried that were very good too are the yellowtail yuzu soy, seared tuna special, crispy tuna roll, fire cracker roll, gyoza, soho maki and angus bone in short rib. Desserts are delish!  This place is reasonable and way better than most sushi restaurants. Fresh and better quality!!   Staff is awesome, owner is amazing! He's goes around to every table to make sure every is going well. Super nice guy too!!  I'm always thinking of coming back here every time I wanna eat Japanese or just some bomb ass raw fish! I'll be back for sure! And you should try this place out!",

We had the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, Hamachi Kama, 15 piece sushi set (Maguro, Sake, Hamachi, Scallops, Trout...), Hamachi Kama, Ikura, Uni, and Sake nigiri.  I was hesitant to order the Uni at first because I've been disappointed every time I've eaten it other than in Japan...but our server highly recommended it and assured me that it was fresh.  I have to say that the Uni was good!  In fact everything we had tasted fresh!  I also thought the prices were reasonable.  I would definitely dine here when I'm in Vegas again!",

    "text": "Konnichiwa, I'd like to introduce my new Happy Hour friend.  Haul your cute little booties over to S. Jones & Warm Springs for one of the best hh deals around town Mon -Sat, 4-6pm. Soho emerges from the former Ambrosia Cafe occupancy.  While Soho is a perfectly good name, in my mind it just didn't fit for a Japanese restaurant, possibly why I kept forgetting about this place despite some of my fellow yelpers' high praise.  The name just seemed like some new, trendy little spot until I made the connection that Chef John Chien Lee is the former chef from Social House.  Therefore, depending on historical events, I'm guessing that the name 'Soho' can only mean 1 of 2 possible things, me love you long time or suck it b*tches.  We tried the many of their happy hour dishes with great success.  My favorite dish is the black cod lettuce wraps.  Other high points included the variety of sushi empanadas for $1 each,  cajun albacore sashimi, firecracker roll, and stuffed mushroom.  The only low point of the evening was the dry and overcooked ika geso, aka the fried calamari that came with a curry aioli dipping sauce.  During hh they offer $1.50 - 3 beers.  I enjoyed the Asahi @ $3 while he happily sipped the $1.50 Coors Light.  The atmosphere is nice but small, .  It looks exactly the same as it did when Ambrosia occupied the space; same layout and color schema.  Service is excellent!  Halfway through our meal owner/chef Lee came out to great us and treated us to a complimentary yellowtail special, which was absolutely delicious!    My verdict = hit it, quit it, hit it again (and again).",

    "text": "Went here on Thursday, 4/24/14, with my sister's bf Tom T. (He's practically just another sibling to me.)  We missed happy hour by 55 minutes. Agh! The HH and lunch specials looked decent and I may come back to try them but this review is for dinner only.  We were stuck in the back corner by the register. Waitress told us about the menu, how we should order something from each page rather than just order rolls so that we don't end up hungry after an hour. I thought that was super bizarre to mention that their rolls aren't adequate for a meal.   Tom ordered a bowl of Miso ($2) and gyoza ($5) and we picked three rolls: Spicy Tuna ($6), Spicy Salmon ($6) and Soft Shelled Crab ($9). Our waitress told us that we should really order the spicy soft shelled crab ($14) instead beacuse it was her favorite and the rolls that we ordered we could \"get anywhere.\" Again, I found this really off putting and we decided against getting the spicy crab as it was a $5 difference than the roll we ordered.  Miso came out, then gyoza. Do not waste your time on the gyoza. $5 for 5 potstickers that have zero flavor. They might as well be from Costco (but Costco's do have some flavor.) Serious waste of money.  Spicy Salmon and Spicy Tuna were not spicy and without the eel sauce that Tom asked for, were bland. The sushi rice was devoid of any flavor which I also found odd. The soft shelled crab roll was great and I'm glad we tried that one.   While we were eating, other staff were trying to tidy up around us which was uncomfortable. I don't want people straightening menus at the table I'm seated at while I'm in the middle of eating or sweeping.  Between the two of us, we threw down $15 a piece before tip. Meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I'd skip dinner and just check out the lunch in the future.",

We got the tuna, salmon, & yellow tail toastadas which was yummy.   The firecracker roll. I did not like the gingery top of it, but once I eliminated it the taste was better.   The jalapeno poppers were just the right size and not overwhelming  The hydro Bibb black cod was okay. The cod was small and the lettuce took over the taste but from what I had tasted it seemed to taste good.   Last the waitress suggested us to try the creme brulee. This dish is hard to perfect as it's my favorite and I've tried this dessert at many sushi places before!",

Had the restaurant not received raving reviews, I wouldn't have had such high expectations, but we were unfortunately disappointed from the moment we stepped inside. Here's why:  -Hostess did not greet us when we walked in- she said \"one minute\" which turned to five minutes before she asked how many were in our party. -She said the wait was going to be about 15 minutes but it ended up being closer to 25. -Food was less than stellar. The rice on the rolls were cold. Some of the rolls were EXTREMELY salty. And aren't all of the rolls typically supposed to come out and be served together? These came out one by one so we couldn't feast like we wanted to.  There were a few other gripes we had but I won't list them all out. I just needed to say my piece cause I don't think we got the value we paid for and we felt the Yelp reviews were pretty overrated after our experience here.",

The sashimi has a \"melts-in-your-mouth freshness\" I didn't expect in a Japanese restaurant... in the middle of the desert...un-freakin'-believable!  At some point in our meal, the owner/chef came over to introduce himself.  To me, it showed his pride in his restaurant and his concern for his customers.  There was an air of genuineness and sincerity in the gesture that I find admirable.   We were so happy with the food and service that we thought it couldn't get better than that.  When the check came, we noticed that we weren't charged for the sodas we ordered.  We called it to their attention but were told it was on the house.  Maybe it was because we ordered a lot of food :) Nevertheless, wow!  What a pleasant surprise :)  Soho is really as good as it gets!",

Due to the uncertain work schedules of my friends, we weren't able to make a reservation anywhere on a Friday night in time for a celebration. However, stumbling on Soho's page with its boastful \"walk ins welcome,\" we decided to swing by there instead of gamble our chances at one of the busier AYCE spots up the street. Arriving at Soho though, which was pretty quiet with a few folks sitting waiting, we were quickly informed it would be a 45 min-1 hour wait... Um, where exactly are walk ins welcome then? Do you even understand what that means? The kicker was that they were holding three huge tables for reservations that hadn't yet come through.   Looking through reviews now, obviously I should've realized this claim was baseless - many state that you should make reservations ahead of time. No idea why they think \"walk ins welcome\" is something that accurately describes their restaurant! The rub of it all is that we did end up at an very popular AYCE place up the street since it had only a 30 min wait. Hopefully Yelp will remove the \"walk ins welcome\" on this restaurant's page.",

They get shipments here and there, as long as they come on time, and they're pretty solid thus far.   The owner will come around and engage with his guests usually. He'll recommend stuff and he made us a complimentary raw scallop dish. Everything tastes so fresh and nice :D.   Try the uni with red snapper (forego the ponzu sauce). The salmon avocado roll is a personal favorite for me. ^^v Yums.   The tostadas are $1 during happy hour so it's a good value. Speaking of which, 4-6pm is happy hour. I also liked the firecracker roll but beware non-spice-peeps, it's spicy! Flaming for me. :0b  Overall I enjoyed my experience and I'll be back to try it again soon ;0).",

    "text": "Came here spontaneously (seriously, we just apparated...didn't even drive) for lunch! I've seen many good reviews and enticing photos on yelp regarding their lunch setos (only $8.50!!!!) so decided to finally try it out. SO WORTH IT.  Service was friendly and casual with smiles from the attentive employees all around. Atmosphere/decor was modern and casual with a lot of open space. Very clean. The kitchen area is half open for customers to see and from what I could tell, there were so many employees. Maybe they're preparing for when it hopefully gets busier in the near future!  Now let me tell you about the food. It looked exactly like all the yelp pictures I had perused, which is quite a testament to how consistent they are, especially for a newer establishment. My boyfriend got the chicken katsu seto and I got the sashimi seto. The side salad had fresh greens and the perfect amount of dressing. The miso was standard and always a welcome addition. There was a side of thinly sliced cucumber in some vinegar-type sauce as well, which I definitely enjoyed.   My favorite of course, was the sashimi itself. It came with 7 thick slices - two salmon, two tuna, two yellowtail, and one snapper. All were succulent and so so fresh, probably one of the freshest I've had in Vegas.  They provided my boyfriend with this house hot sauce which was so good and addicting. I alternated dipping my sashimi between that and the soy sauce! The little itty bitty mug of green tea was adorable and perfect for my tiny hands - normal mugs are way too large. I appreciated this detail immensely.  The icing on top of the cake was that the owner/chef himself came to check up on us and offered us a complimentary dish - this popular yellowtail sashimi with micro cilantro, fried jalapeno, and some kind of ponzu sauce. It melted in my mouth, not gonna lie. We later found out that the dish amounted to $12.  So why give this place 4/5 instead of 5/5? Am I just being a hardass? The only reason I loved this place was because of the lunch set value and quality and the comped dish, which I'm pretty sure doesn't happen all the time. Looking through the menu items, they seem to be quite pricey, so I want to come back and try them before really deciding that it's worth it.  Yay! I'm a fan.",

I have been to many top rated Japanese restaurants in 5-star hotels in the Strip in the past, and they were amazing but not the best value for the $$$$. I can definitely say that some were rather overpriced. This place, on the other hand, provide the best quality sushi, better than the most I had in the strip hotel restaurants, for much less $$. I am very picky when it comes to sushi, so we decided to seat by the head chef for the chef special, and every plate and every piece of sushi made us speechless. They were perfect! If I am in Vegas, I will ALWAYS choose this place over the restaurants in the Strip hotels even though I almost always stay in the strip area.       HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!",

I saw great reviews for this place on Yelp and thought I would give it a try tonight.  I've never had fresh sushi that tasted this amazing.  The sushi chef / owner is passionate about what he does and you can taste that with every dish.  The chef's attention to detail, dedication to craft and passion for his food are unparalleled in this town.  I will DEFINITELY be coming back here.  Prices are the best I've seen for fresh sushi and the quality blew me away.",

The owner/exec. chef is usually present, at least at dinner time. He's been there every time we've gone in. He comes out and talks to the patrons, and shows that he cares about everyone's experience.",

    "text": "With all these five star reviews for Soho, I had to visit.  We went for lunch the very first time and let's just say I was not too thrilled about the whole experience.  It wasn't even worth writing a review in my opinion because lunch was boring.  I honestly had no intention of returning, but Soho's reviews just kept getting better and better.  This time, we made a point of coming for dinner because that's where all the unique offerings happened.  (Since our first visit, I think they do offer more of their exciting menu items during lunch time.)  The Lunch Experience:  The Husband got the Loco Moco Lunch Seto \"Soho Blend Seasoned Hamburger Patty\" ($8.50).    * Sashimi Lunch Seto \"Chef's Choice\" ($8.50)  The lunch menus offered were disappointing and they didn't look that special either.  I went to check it out during its first month when all the rave reviews were happening. I was very disappointed, especially when only up the street is an awesome Japanese bento lunch special that I truly love.    A few months go by and Soho is still blowing up, so we decide to give it a try and make sure that we make it over for dinner. The whole experience was a complete 180.  The dinner menu cannot compare to the lunch menu at all!  Lunch is a 2-3 experience and dinner is a 4-5 experience.  The Dinner Experience:  We ordered mostly from the Special Cold Dishes and what a treat they were.  Yum  yum.    The owner was about to come to our table during our first visit, but a bunch of his former colleagues all walked in and he never had a chance to return.  This time he chatted with us and sent over a comped dish and just made the effort on building a more personal experience and customer base.  I really appreciate the effort.  I think their lunch offerings have since changed and they are allowing you to order other things besides their basic lunch menu.  Thank goodness.  Would hate for people to judge this place based on their original lunch menu. Bleh.  These are the yummy dishes we ordered:  * Salmon Wasabi Creme ($11) * Yellowtail Yuzu Soy ($12) * Ume Scallop ($12) * Miso Marinated Black Cod ($18) * Sea Urchin Sashimi ($9) * Spicy Salmon Handroll ($4) * White Fish Shiso Pesto Tostada ($2) * Wild Saba * Hamachi Salsa Verde Tostada ($2) and two other specials that I can't remember the name of but it looked and tasted awesome.  Presentation is definitely something to write home about and everything tasted fresh.  It was just a really great experience coming for dinner. We definitely plan on going there again during dinner time!",

    "text": "This place deserves five stars and more.  I was expecting another disappoint after the last two Asian Fusion restaurants I visited.  Luckily I may have just found my second home.  Originally I had been wanting to visit this place after seeing so many rave reviews on Yelp from my fellow Yelpers.  I came here for lunch and I base my reviews on service, quality, presentation, and lastly taste.  Service - We had seen two servers helping everyone throughout the restaurant and they were really on top of there game.  Food came out immediately despite how busy it was.  Refills happened without me having to ask.  I happened to spill the wasabi from my meal on my tie and the server noticed right away and brought water and napkins for me.  That's the real deal right there.  Kudos for the service!  Quality - Fusion food is a rather new concept that is slowly becoming an emerging market.  They didn't go cheap on any part of the meals we were served.  All freshest ingredients and healthy food!  Presentation - I couldn't believe how much food I was staring at for the incredible fairly priced items.  My braised short rib looked amazing and I was a little nervous about the wasabi, but shockingly it was AMAZING!  The presentation looked like something mom used to present for dinner when I was a kid.  Food - I think by now you get the jest of my overall review.  The braised short rib was cooked tender and to perfection.  It literally melted in my mouth and it was GOOD!  That wasabi sauce was not spicy at all and I definitely have now bookmarked this place to try more items.  For great service, amazing food, affordable meals and another place to call home, Soho is the place to go!",

These are not skimpy even if it is their HH portion.  I seriously can't believe they are only a $1.  We have tried (over several visits) the Soho Maki, Tostadas, Beef Tataki, Albacore Sashimi, Firecracker Roll, Ika Geso, Cod Lettuce Wraps, their bento box Soho Moco and, all were pretty good .

For lunch I had the sashimi bento which comes with salad, miso and white rice.  Friend had the teriyaki salmon bento and the teriyaki came on the side. Definite plus for that in itself because although she loves her sauces I am not a fan, especially of teriyaki! And only like $8.95 for the bento! Good deal.  We also shared an a Sashimi salad which comes on a pretty large portion of greens and a decent amount of fish. However the Sashimi Bento is just a mini version of the Sashimi salad + the other things that come with the bento so it was kind of a double order.  We also tried the lettuce cups and the fish was tastey on that as well.  AND if you have never been there before, the chef sends out their specialty yellowtail dish which was nomtastic especially with the little fried jalapenos on to of it.  Service was good and food came out in a timely manner.  We left stuffed!",

There's a wide selection of happy hours items at great prices. I tried 5 of them. They were all good though I'd prefer some of them being less seasoned. When it comes to fresh seafood I subscribe to the mantra of simple is best. In spite of that I enjoyed my meal quite a bit. The service was prompt and the waiter's recommendation was good. The space was nicely decorated. Noise level was high but that's what you would expect with a crowded place. I'd go back and try some simple nigiri and sashimi next time.",

Chef John Chien Lee, owner and former Social House chef, is a master at his craft even after sharing a large sake (Orka ginju $60 very tasty) he didn't miss a beat.  Watching the staff behind the sushi bar was like watching a well oiled machine.  Nunu was to John's left (one time JJ gave Nunu the day off) and was the perfect team.  Ordered their Triple S Roll ($15 - shrimp, scallops, spicy tuna, tempura white fish and asparagus)  I also ordered nigiri - octopus, spicy scallops, akodai snapper and halibut.  Very fresh and not a puny cut.  They also have specials not on the menu.  I had their Monk Fish (yuuummmm) with ponzu sauce and taro root chips.  Everything served was fresh, great portion size and reasonably priced.  The have a special dessert chef bake specifically for them  My party had the Matcha Tiramisu ($7) which is a green tea soaked sponge cake (I took a picture and already posted it).  The menu described a \"Matcha sabayon\" which when I asked John what that was - he sweetly giggled and said he didn't know.  Cute.  Another catch was an item on the menu described as a \"field octopus.\"  An obvious typo but also too cute.  I will be back!",

I don't know if I can conclude this is the best sushi place in town though... Personal favorites were salmon, and oyster with uni & fish roe. But I expected the uni to be more fresh.",

    "text": "Soho is the kind of restaurant we need to see more of.  It reminds me of an informal Yonaka.  Now, you don't have to take that with a grain of salt!  As far as my liking, I am more comfortable and relaxed in a less stuffy atmosphere.  So I mean that utmost positively.  The quality of the meal here itself deserves a 3 piece suit.    The sashimi is 'to a T' exactly what the other reviewers have wrote about.  Sans repetition, I will agree that the fish is top tier at Soho.    Cajun Albacore had a mini taste of spice accompanied by a smooth cream and in the middle of it all was the tender melty meat.  Yes.  4/5  The Black Cod luttuce wraps' flavor and texture were delicate, umami & fap worthy. 5/5  [As a test of their standard fare, we ordered a traditional sushi joint roll.]    The Temura Shrimp Roll came as a surprisingly delectable entree.  I can tell that all the rice I've ever had at all the AYCE sushi restaurants before were done wrong.  No sog and definitely not a bland choice.  Go ahead order one & see for yourself. 4/5  An Uni Tasting Platter of 3 different regions (30$) with 4 pieces of each was the knock out of this lunch!  Santa Barbara was the usual beige toned uni that you may be familiar with.  A bit more sea floor with this one.  Mmm.  The next was the more orange kind (I think it was from Catalina?) This was sweeter & creamier. Mmm.  Last was the real deal from Hokkaido Japan!  It was a darker reddish tone almost blood hue.  They were smaller and slighly undertone flavored.  I think there was some subtle nuances to it that I am not experienced enough to pick up on.  Mmm.  All three of us favored a different region uni.  Heh, different strokes. 500/5  Lastly I'll mention the Tadas.  Ahi & avacado or 3 other assorted chunks atop a light crispy rice flat. Serious twist and seriously good with a silly cheap price.  5/5  If cuisine were music, this Modern Japanese style would be my favorite genre!",

    "text": "Best deal in Vegas. The price, the food, excellent experience with the waiters and got to meet the chef personally!  My boyfriend wanted to get sushi as we had a huge dinner the other night at Sushisamba (review upcoming). I start looking for sushi restaurants in LV and Soho comes up. My boyfriend checks it out and says \"nah this doesn't look like sushi, look at the pictures\". The pictures were showing a lot of rolls and I had already decided that I wanted the rib (somehow I was pretty hungry even after the big meal) as it had great reviews. Also, the pictures could be deceiving as they have changed their menu slightly, so the pictures of the menu here are outdated. We decided not to go there as he wasn't that hungry. To be honest, even though I love rolls, I prefer sashimi or sushi, way less filling and delicious. Previously we had gone to an AYCE sushi place where we learned that they didn't serve sashimi and they complained when we left some rice.   Anyways, he was not that hungry to try another AYCE given that they never offered sashimi and we waited. I was starving so eventually he felt sorry for me and we drove to Soho. As soon as we were parking we noticed the amazing lunch deal: $8.50!!! We had to check that out.   We went inside, were seated and the waiter asked us how we found the place. I said Yelp and he said \"well the food reviews are always on point, the service has been up and down but we'll try the best\". I liked his honesty. We were given the lunch menus and one dinner menu. We both ordered the sashimi lunch which was 7 pieces of nigiri plus a bowl of rice, salad and miso soup. I ordered the ribs ($19) from the dinner menu (the one that is here is outdated) and waited.  The lunch boxes came first. I really have to say that this is the best sashimi lunch I have eaten EVER. First, the price was only $8.50, second, the pieces were big. And I mean big, I was pleasantly surprised. Many people think that you can not get full from sashimi lunches because it is only fish but trust me, you can.  As for the rib, it was delicious as well. It fell off the bone, the sauce was good, the potatoes great, everything awesome.   As soon as we were done with the food, the chef approached our table and introduced himself saying how pleased he was that we ordered the sashimi and the rib. He then asked us if we were full. We said yes (because we were). He then asked again that if he were to send us something, we would eat it. Of course we said YES!. A couple minutes later, the waitress brought us a plate from the chef. He sent us a couple pieces of Yellowtail Yuzu Soy which she said was their #1 dish. The pieces were delicious.   As for the service, it was great. The waiter that seated us said he had to go and pointed us to the girl who would be taking care of us from then on.   Really great and surprisingly affordable lunch!",

There were 3 of us in the party and we had the following entrees: Yellowtail sashimi - the best that I've ever tasted. Even my daughter who is not a sashimi eater loved it. Seared Tuna sashimi - very good taste.   4 kinds of rolls spicy tuna, rainbow roll, twin dragon, and triple S - they are all good.   We also ordered the 4 different tostadas that are very refreshing. The Chef/owner came to say hi and he gave us a complimentary salmon sashimi that has an interesting ingredient: pop rocks Grilled hamachi kama is very fresh and flavorful with soy sauce and lemon dipping sauce. The price is a little bit more than the other sushi house off strip, but the freshness and taste of the food is worth the money.  The service staff are attentive.  We will be coming back and we will be bringing some friends to experience the Soho Sushi.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in town from NYC for a couple of days and we wanted to get off the strip and away from the crowds.  We are big sushi lovers, and have quite a few favorite places back home.  After looking at Yelp, we chose SOHO.   Wow...what an incredible choice.  It's a small place...intimate...without a lot of the glitz of LV.  That's ok...we've gotten our fill of that on this trip.   What we wanted was some quiet so we could re-connect and just enjoy some really good sushi  We got all of that and more.  From the time we walked in, the staff was incredibly attentive and accommodating.  Our server Angelica made some great recommendations...the yellowtail, especially, being one of the freshest and most succulent sashimi dishes we've ever eaten.    We made three choices, and after we were done, we ordered one additional roll. I wasn't even that hungry, but the food was so good I felt obligated!   When we were done with that our server brought another plate over. My wife said \"oh, we didn't order that,\" and she said \"this is from the chef.\"  It was ocean trout, which we'd never had before.  It was a deep red, like salmon, with a meatier taste.  Outstanding!  Later, John came to out table.  He's the chef and owner, and he explained that he thought we'd enjoy the ocean trout because he'd seen the other items we'd chosen.  Very thoughtful, and always a treat to meet the owner and the person who prepared our meal.  I think that's the True secret to SOHO...pride and passion.  Not only was John personally invested in us, but all of his employees clearly took steps to ensure we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  John and his entire team went \"the extra mile\" to please us, and they succeeded with flying colors.    We would highly recommend SOHO. It's a little out of the way, but that's the charm, and it is WELL WORTH the journey.  Oh, and a bonus?  It's probably about 30% less than you'd pay on the strip for less flavor and quality.  Sushi lover?  Don't miss this place!!",

We are from San Diego and have had a lot of really good sushi, so we were excited to try Soho.  Upon arriving, we were surprised at how busy the place was.  Every table was full.  That seemed like a good sign.  Luckily, we didn't have to wait as we came in just before the crowd.  The restaurant was decorated nicely, and seemed very clean.    We ordered the Cajun Albacore, Mixed Tempura, Crispy Tuna Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Garlic Tuna, and the Chef threw in the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy.  Pricing was decent as the entire bill came to $57.  We thought that the sashimi plates were delicious and the Yellowtail was AMAZING!  I thought it was very nice for the chef to do this and I would have given Soho a 5 star rating, had it not been for the fact that they didn't have any rolls with Eel or they didn't have the regular crispy tempura topping on the rolls that most places have.  The crispy tuna roll was good and different.  It had fried the rice on the bottom instead of being rolling in the other crispy stuff.  The tempura veggies was by far the BEST tempura we have ever had.  If we are in the mood for tempura and yellowtail sashimi, we will make Soho the place we go.  Because there are no rolls with Eel, we will have to try other places next time.    Overall though, Soho is a great place to have sushi.",

    "text": "This place is a steal! Can't really beat $5 HH for sushi and sashimi. And they're not mediocre plates..they were all pretty interesting and creative items aside from your typical sushi rolls (which several were also $5!) The tostada was refreshing..almost similar to eating chips and salsa dip. It had a nice taste and left me wanting more. The salmon yuzu soy was just ok. The salmon cuts weren't the best but just ok. I've had much smoother silkier pieces. But it wasn't bad. The dynamite was a good deal... a whole roll! It was a small roll, but nice to have a full roll on HH. The flavor was good but a little too heavy on the sauce/cream mixture. I also had the $3 Sapporo. Great HH's consist of a good selection of food/drink and for a great price. I don't come across a lot of good sushi HH's so this place is definitely worth a try for good HH.",

    "text": "Surprisingly, I enjoyed dining at this restaurant. I'm usually hesitant when going to Japanese restaurants that don't have AYCE options, but Soho has a great Happy Hour menu that made up for it. I thought the HH plates were going to be small, but all the dishes were served at a decent portion. My fiance and I shared 6 HH dishes (2 orders of spicy salmon rolls, 1 order of angus beef sliders, 1 mixed seafood tostada, 1 order of chicken karaage, and 1 order of bang bang shrimp) and we were pretty full by the end of our lunch. I just wish service was a little bit better, it was slow at the start - felt like the servers were barely paying attention to us. Once my friend started calling out to them for more help, they became much more attentive.",

They have a nice happy hour menu that was pretty extensive that we ordered from almost exclusively.  The tostada was the best of the choices for the evening.  Paired with 7-8 chilled Sake bottles we managed to polish off, the evening was a memorable one for sure.   The service was awesome, dining area clean, and the vibe was relaxing.   Chef John Chien Lee def hit a home run here.  Since I have a more fav sushi joint I say a 4, but with wifey really liked Soho J R so I'll give them a 5.  Happy wife, happy life...",

    "text": "Had Soho bookmarked for quite a while so decided it was time to stop in for lunch. First off, any place that offers happy hour during lunch is high on my list! Very reasonably priced drinks from 12 to 3 Monday-Saturday.   They also offer a fixed price lunch for either $8.95 or $10.95 depending on your entree. Soup, salad and rice are included and you can dessert for an extra $2. I chose the salmon teriyaki with miso soup, seaweed salad and brown rice and added a philly roll. The miso, seaweed salad and philly roll were all very good.   The salmon was a tad fishy for me but pouring the teriyaki sauce over it made it much better. I didn't care for the brown rice at all. It just seemed undercooked and chewy. I ordered the green tea cheesecake and just like Ohjah's it was way too dry and not creamy at all.   Service was excellent throughout our lunch. I would definitely return if in the area, but wouldn't make the drive again just for lunch.",

First of all, HAPPY HOUR for the whole day 12-7pm! They might have one of the best happy hour menus I've ever seen. All the food was so flavorful and unique. This place is definitely a fusion of Japanese and Mexican. A lot of the sushi appetizers and dishes had tomato, onions, and jalapenos in them. It really puts a fun twist on your typical and basic sushi dishes. I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

During happy hour you get three sliders for $5 or during other hours you get two sliders and fries for $8. The Angus patties are cooked to perfection and served on those delicious Hawaiian rolls that everyone probably knows from house parties. The only veggies are tomato and lettuce which us fine by me, and has a spread taste like a slightly lighter version if Cane's sauce and is just super amazing! Now that I've properly explained the sliders I'll move on to the Tempura shrimp which is best if you get only one type because then it's three for $5. The breading on them is nice, light, and crunchy! The fish is fresh here, no frozen trash here, and next time I'm definitely trying the fresh cod for the fish and chips. Bathroom is well kept and clean. I would reccomend you come here and try something whether it be the shrimp, sliders, or anything else!",

We had the California rolls and it was great no mayonnaise and very fresh real crab. The rainbow roll was good loaded with fish and super pretty on the plate. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna it was perfect it had zero mayonnaise and was spiced with wasabi. The spicy tuna roll was perfectly made and again all the fish was fresh. The only thing that pulled this down to four stars was the kitchen prep time. It wasn't super crowded and they had three sushi chefs working but it took what seemed like forever to get the rolls. The happy hour menu look awesome I will definitely come back to try it.",

We told them we had stopped coming because we went vegan & they accommodated vegan dishes for us. The veggie rolls were delicious! Everything we ate was really flavorful. Soho is so amazing!

They don't scrimp on the portions either! The service is warm yet very professional. Only negative is that it is crazy busy before 7. Definitely make a reservation.",

This place definitely is NOT a \"sushi\" restaurant, though they have some sushi offerings. That being said, no all you can eat either. The service was quite slow and inattentive which made things go by agonizingly slow. We had to make some requests for changes on our rolls (for a shellfish allergy) and they were less than accommodating, even bringing out one item which was entirely crab. Other requests for additions or changes were all around generally ignored and you will probably have to walk outside to the gas station next door to get your water refilled before a server happens to drop by and top you off. Definitely a cool \"hang out\" place for some, but it's social not satiable.",

I still remember the first time we came to SOHO, and the chef sent a complimentary plate of Yellowtail sashimi to us and said \"welcome to SOHO\" ...  That Yellowtail was the best tasting Yellowtail sashimi I ever had before! Thank you Chef!  Ever since, we returned many times and the quality of food never changed.  It was a timeframe when the restaurant was open for dinner only, and I didn't like it. Now, I am very happy SOHO is open for lunch again! Also Happy Hour is back, too!  Last time we were here, we tried the Lunch Prix Fixe ( available from Monday to Saturday, Noon-4pm), either for $8.95 or $10.95 ... I choose the Teriyaki Salmon with white rice. It was including a Miso soup and a mixed greens salad ($10.95). The portion was very sensible but satisfying. Dessert was available to add for additional $2.- and I choose the Mochi Ice cream, 2 pieces (one green tea and one mango flavor) ... Very yummy! Also ordered a glass of Sangria ($3) and a glass of Iced green tea ($3) ...   Noticed that the restaurant got very comfortable, new chairs! I really like the way it looks! Happy to return and enjoy our neighborhood restaurant!",

    "text": "Well, back here again for my semi annual visit to my favorite Sushi restaurant in the US. What probably was the most wonderful was seeing Chef John and Michelle again, and of course their entire team. I've been coming here for about two years now, every 6-8 months or so, and every time I'm greeted like family. What makes this place great, aside from the amazing food the Chef Tae puts out, is the warm and friendly service and how happy everyone seems to be when working there.  On to the food. Ask for live sweet shrimp! It's a little pricey ($9.00 per order) but they literally kill it in front of you (or at the sushi bar if you order at the table). How much fresher can you get? It's also my girlfriend's favorite, which was way more worth than the more expensive, less delicious versions they sell on the Strip. But for me, what stood out the most this time around was some type of salmon dish with pop rocks. It gave a very interesting texture and experience that you don't find in many restaurants. The fatty salmon sashimi was beyond delicious and my stay would not have been complete without my regular Macadamia Nut Dragon Roll and (recently added) Truffle Tempura Beans. Come for happy hour and order them, it's a super good deal and really nice to munch on in between raw dishes.  If you want a drunk, get the MIO Sparkling Sake, it's Michelle's favorite and goes really well with their specialty drinks. A special thank you to Sheila for always being wonderful and I'm so glad to meet Julie as well.  My only regret is not coming back hungrier as I did not have room to enjoy the Santa Barbara Uni or Oysters that I got last time. Well, I'll be back in a few short months, and I will not make that mistake again!",

The place is tiny with lines out the door on weekends, but somehow they keep it rolling smoothly and I've never had to wait for longer than ~15 minutes. The sashimi is my fave - huge chunks of amazing, tender, fresh fish arranged on a cool-looking platter on ice. So good. Akami, magura, sake, hamachi, toro, you name it and it's great. Their unagi is probably better than almost any I've ever had. I wouldn't get it as maki though. Oddly we had a sake roll last time that was a little below par compared to the rest, but I'm sure it was a fluke. The happy hour menu is a great deal and well worth it, if you don't mind smaller portions you can def eat on the cheap. Heads up on the wagu beef sliders, they might be the best appetizer they have. I've had them both times and they are off the hook! Really good mochi too. Great sushi bar ambiance, it can get loud when people have had enough saki but never annoyingly so. And the waiters are as good with hospitality as any you'd find on the strip. Always friendly, smiling, and helpful. They keep the table loaded with food and the water glass is never empty. I usually tip around 25% because it's well deserved. There's a sushi joint on almost every corner in Vegas, but I never stray too far because....well why would I when it's such a good package deal? The prices are commensurate with good sushi in most large cities. Soho is the bomb, I'll be coming back enough to get VIP status and my own parking spot hopefully;-)",

    "text": "I love the whole Soho Franchise! On my last trip to Las Vegas I tried Soho Sushi Burrito and it was pretty awesome so naturally I wanted to try their sushi restaurant.  I had made reservations for my fiance and I earlier in the day, which was a good idea because this place gets packed fast. We were seated right away upon arriving, and the vibes were friendly and casual.  Service was a bit slow but good. Our server was nice and checked on us often. He took our drink orders right away and gave us a lot of time to look at the menu.  We ordered the following: Carpaccio; Golden Ocean Trout and Salmon with Avocado Creme, Premium Sashimi Platter, Kumamoto Oysters with Uni and Ikura (not on the menu), Multiple Nigiri Pieces, Braised Short Ribs, and Hamachi Kama (not on the menu).  The Golden Ocean Trout was the best Carpaccio style sashimi I have ever had in my life. The way they prepared it was just incredible. The flavors and mouthfeel was out of this world, this is a must order! The Salmon with Avocado Creme was good too, very fresh.   The nigiri pieces and sashimi here were generously portioned and very fresh. A few of my Maguro were a little chewy but other then that everything was good.  The Kama was excellent. Buttery, tender and juicy. It was just cooked and flavored so well, some of the best we've ever had. We were so excited to eat it we didn't even take a picture! The Kumamoto oysters with Uni was good, not the best I've ever had but definitely delicious still. The short ribs had good flavor but were quite dry.  Overall we had a great time here. The service was a little slow but they always made sure we had what we needed and they were very nice. One of the managers or owners came by to talk to us (probably because of all the food we ordered). The food was awesome, we will definitely be back!!",

To the friendly atmosphere, to the food, the glassware, and the presentation, it was awesomeeeeee. I really liked the sashimi plates and the rolls were to die for. You could literally taste every part of the roll and the fish was super fresh! It is a little more on the pricier side, and not all you can eat, but I believe it's definitely worth it. Super delicious and a must try if you're in the area. I'm sure the wait gets pretty long because it's a very small place.",

They have a lot more variety on the menu, including appetizers, some fried items, and plenty of rolls, along with the set bento-style options. I also get the feeling they'll serve you some of the dinner items as long as they have the items ready for it, but your mileage may vary.  Soho also has a new-ish happy hour menu from 4-7pm everyday (except Sundays since they're closed) with 24 items on it as well, with beer and sake as cheap as $3.  The drink prices are also available at lunch too, so you have ample opportunity to get a little buzz in the afternoon! :O  I was really happy to see Chef John Lee back behind the counter as well, working with kitchen staff and prepping some items for dinner. Service here remains excellent and I can't give enough glowing reviews to my favorite Japanese Restaurant in Vegas.",

I might actually have to pay a bit of money here\" and then you sit down and at the end of your meal they hand you the check and you're like.. \"wow that's a decent price!\"  Granted that decent price only comes during happy hour or lunch time, but still! It's a very welcome surprise.  I've eaten the sashimi lunch special practically every time that I've come here and let me tell you... This is definitely the place you want to come if you want fish quality that's above average for a price that won't leave you begging for OT at work. Keep in mind that this deal is only available during lunch, but when you're paying a little over $10 for 7 pieces of sashimi, rice, salad, miso soup, and a random side dish? I'd eat lunch here every day if I could.  On the days when I'm feeling like a million bucks, I sometimes go out of my way to order the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy dish. It is AWESOME. Aside from that.. I've visited during happy hour once and just kept shoveling these $1 tostadas into my stomach. Really, I just couldn't stop.",

And it comes with no broccoli.  It's cheaper but I don't order food because it's cheap, I order food because of the quality and the taste.  I was very disappointed and couldn't even send it back since I ordered take out.  Time to find a different Japanese restaurant.",

Sometimes the texture grosses me out and I don't like the flavor of most fish. However this place had rave reviews so I dipped my toe in once more.  My favorite dish, the Cajun albacore sashimi has really nice flavor, smooth and tender texture, and pop from the jalapeno. The firecracker was my second favorite as it's creamy spicy tangy and sweet and has crunchy and soft textures. Tapas were my least favorite. The kimchi taco was the best one. Lastly, the potstickers came with a vinegar soy sauce which I didn't like.",

It's only 10 bucks but includes 7 pieces of sashimi, a bowl of rice, miso soup, house salad, and a small dish of cucumber salad. The interior to the place isn't anything overly fancy or special but it's the food that counts right? Service was also pretty good and friendly. Outside of their lunch special I would say their entrees and specialty rolls are a bit overpriced though compared to other sushi places. Specialty rolls are about 12-15$. But consider that you are paying for freshness quality over quantity. I'll definitely come back here next time I have more cash to blow.",

We had king crab and rock shrimp tempura, sunny salmon, and tried many suggestions of our food server. It's good to go with a group in order to be able to sample more different dishes.

Depending on your timing you may have to wait, it's really popular with locals and tourists follow so try to get in early, especially when going as a group.   One tip, if you're going for lunch, you can ask for the dinner menu to order the more interesting dishes.   If I had to make a criticism, the ambiance needs help as it took over a restaurant and inherited the questionable decor. Also the arrangement of seating on the space can be improved, like the useless reception area could be replaced with a 4-top. BUT you forget all of this after enjoying the very consistent, great food.   Don't hesitate to go people, Chef John is one of Vegas' local superstars. Go now, it's brilliant.",

Food is delicious. My favorite sushi spot in Vegas hands down! If you want sushi and or Japanese food don't settle for anywhere else. Make the drive no matter where you are you will not regret it.  The Yellow tail yuzu sashimi is the best I've had.  The lunch specials and happy hour are AWESOME!  Just met the chef and owner and you can see the passion he has for his restaurant.   I don't think I'd go anywhere else.",

He thought it looked cool so we decided to check it out. At that time they just opened and barely had any reviews. Ever since then we make it a tradition to come here on special birthdays for our families and friends. I do notice they change their waiters, but the service is still always very good. The price is worth the quality they deliver, and the food is always innovative. I never know what to expect when coming here as they always change their menus!",

Every time we go to Vegas we try to find a good sushi restaurant and never seem to get it quite right.  But this time we hit the Jackpot!  We went on a Thursday night and there wasn't a wait.  The owner introduced himself right away and asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he immediately sent our the house special, which was delicious!  From the first bite we were in for a great night.   The sashimi platter was delicious, and the pieces were bigger than any place i've been before.  It was a steal at $25.  The salmon wasabi cream was my favorite.    The owner asked if we wanted sea urchin and we declined as my BF had had a terrible experience with it before but the chef insisted on making it in a way we would like it and sure enough, it was delicious!       I'm not much of a reviewer but I left there feeling like I'd had such a great experience I had to share!  In fact, we loved it so much we brought our friends back with us on Saturday. :)  Same excellent friendly service, amazing food and a great time. Definitely worth the trip off the strip!",

    "text": "Soho was suggested to me by a coworker who loves sushi and I had drove by it a few times so I was curious to find out how good it would be.   The food was amazing and the fish was of best quality and fresh. I would give the food 5 stars. I was expecting it be because the owner is Chef John Chien Lee, former executive chef of Social House at Aria. The service wasn't the best at least for me with the wait staff and I expand on why later on.   First the food. We ordered baked mussels, seaweed salad, the spicy tuna roll, the salmon and avocado roll, and the salmon wasabi creme (the dish I was excited to try the most). The appetizers tasted the same as they would any other Japanese restaurant nothing special. I love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and paired with avocado in a roll. The spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the fish, but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it. In the roll, the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big chunk, which was very appreciated. Mid meal, the Chef and Owner, John Chien Lee, came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming. He saw that I had a thing for salmon and asked if I would mind to try something similar, but not salmon, compliments of the chef and I said sure! He brought us out the house special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious! I never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and I enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had top it off!   The service would get a rating of 3 stars. It wasn't till the chef talked to us that the waiters had a bit more urgency to serve us, which was just two people. It wasn't too busy when we walked in, but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the waiter also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment. I think that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us, they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the house, which we did not receive. Though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout!   The ambiance of the place was okay. It was like top 40 with house music playing, similar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness. Decoration was okay, could have been more, but will do. I did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up!   All in all if your looking for fresh fish at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well known sushi spot on the strip, without the pricey cost, this is definitely a spot to try! Happy hour runs Mon-Sat. the days they are open from 4p-6pm. And even though the service was ehh, the food was delicious and I'll definitely go back for more.",

    "text": "I feel like I just started dating someone and I KNOW he's going to be my husband.. It's one thing to have great sushi. It's another to have great sushi down the street from your home... but it's another to have great sushi, down the street from your home, AND behind a Chevron gas station. Think Lotus of Siam in proximity to the Green Door.  I read the reviews of my trusted yelpers so yes, I was pretty confident I was going to have a great meal with great service. I didn't, however, expect to have my tastebuds orgasm from my first bite to the last sliver of dessert. I love great sushi but I've become lazy in my years. It's easier to train my palate to accept good AYCE sushi then train my wallet for the $$$ and gas to drive 10 miles for top quality cuts of fish. So after just one amazing dinner at Soho, I'm beyond thrilled that Strip Sushi at Local prices now truly exists.  I started out with the Yellowtail sashimi - with tempura jalapeno, micro cilantros, garlic oil, and yuzu soy - I was told this was a chef signature dish. WOW really sums it up. I would have paid at leasst 20 dollars for that plate but it was only 10. Next up was a salmon tostada, rock shrimp tempura, and the tuna box sushi roll. The tostada was delicious... at 3 bucks a pop - I know that I could order like 5 of those things and be deliriously happy with myself. The taro tostada was light (be careful it may break) but just perfect and the avocado cream and cilantro sauce mixed with the freshest salmon I've had in a long while --- all of this adds up to Ahhhhh-mazing. The box sushi was just the cutest. Oh, and it had the perfect combination of textures and flavors.  The little crunchy rice cracker balls on the bottom combined with just the right amount of rice, tuna sushi, avocado and topped with a layer of shrimp. It's mouthwatering just to write about again.  Do you have a non-fish eating loved one in your life like I do? Well, the jidori chicken is \"the best chicken dish I've ever had\" says my non-fish eating husband. He is going to try the spare ribs next -- I'm so glad that the non-sushi items are just as good because that is the dealmaker in this household.  Soho's service is top notch. The chef owner John Chien Lee is just a delight to talk to. His visit to our table really added a nice touch to one of my most memorable meals.  If you love sushi, if you love strip sushi, if you love all you can eat sushi, if you love sushi but haven't been able to afford Kabuto, Nobu, Kumi, Koi, Okada, Yonaka, or Sushi Roku ----- whatever part of town you are in --- put this on your list of MUST-TRYs.... You won't be disappointed. You will have a great experience that you'll tell your family, friends, coworkers, fellow yelpers, and just anyone who will listen.  If I wasn't married,  or if you actually could marry a sushi restaurant, I would be married to Soho with children by now...it's that good.",

So what better night to try SoHo than anniversary night? Based on its fabulous reviews from fellow yelpers, I wasn't worried and certainly was not disappointed!   From entry to exit it was an excellent dining experience! One of the best I've had in a long time. From the food to the service, everything was rockin'! Our waiter was on point, friendly and funny, attentive but not pushy....perfect!   Food....delish!!!! We ordered so many things I don't know where to begin. It's almost like Japanese tapas being as the servings are so small. We had the yellowtail sashimi appetizer- I've had this citrusy yellowtail and jalapeno creation many times and at many different restaurants and its by far my favorite thing to order, but it was also by far my favorite here at SoHo!!! They made it different by frying the jalapeno in a tempura batter I believe which gave the dish a slight crunch and made it different than other establishments! Well played SoHo, well played! Onward.....tostada's, think we had 10! Tuna, shrimp and hamachi all delish. Angus gyoza, cod lettuce wraps, and crispy tuna all phenomenal.   Nice touch...the chef came to our table and spoke with us, even brought us a special dish. Hawaiian tuna poke, which was so light and delectable I wanted a second order but was too stuffed to go there!   This may very well be my favorite new sushi spot. We will know the next few times I go, but from first glance it's a winner.",

I will be visiting this establishment on a more frequent basis. I'm excited to try their happy hour specials. And, I definitely have to try their Soho Moco. I'm a sucker for Hawaiian food.

No joke every dish is like a party in my mouth and the quality is really high and I'm a really picky eater. I'm not a big sashimi fan but I've been converted after the chef sent us one of his melt in your mouth signature sashimi dish. We ordered 4 types of tostadas, 3 types of sushi, jalapeno poppers and the baked mussels. My husband loved the sauce the mussels came with he started dipping everything in it, everything was delicious I have no complaints whatsoever. Service was great everyone was so friendly and topped up. My water constantly and removed empty dishes quickly to make room for more. We also had their famous green tea tiramisu which was to die for. We came during happy hour so our entire bill came to be just $37! I don't like vegas but I'd come back just for this place!",

The place was extremely clean and the smell of raw fish was kept to a minimum, while some sushi places have that fried fish smell, this one didn't.  The staff was so friendly and inviting offering food off of their menu with such respect to the chef.  We ordered 3 sushi rolls, Shrimp Tempura, Firecracker and Salmon Avocado, which are some basic rolls to try.  I was shocked at how fresh and flavorful the rolls were! yum! A gentleman came over to our table and introduced himself as the chef! He was beyond nice! He then sent over 2 Sashimi plates and some Jalapeno poppers! Free of charge! I am not into sashimi so i thought I would give it a try.  My mind was blown! If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! Best sushi place ever.",

We made a reservation for 8pm as the reviews mentioned that happy hour is always packed. When we arrived we were seated immediately. Our waiter Sheila made a few recommendations and based on the reviews we ordered some of their sashimi speciality dishes. The Golden Ocean Trout and Yellowtail Zuzu Soy were absolutely amazing. We also had some oysters that melted in our mouths like butter. Sheila made our night feel very special and treated us like we were in a five star restaurant.

It's located pretty far off the beaten path but you walk in and you get a great jJpanese meal.  Every dish is great, the waitstaff is helpful, and the prices are surprisingly good considering the quality.    We had the brussel sprouts, vegetable roll, tuna roll, egg roll, and mis soup.  We coupled that with the house saki.  The brussel sprouts were outstanding - one of the best dishes in Vegas.  The tuna roll was awesome as well.  The saki was great, too, especially for  $7 for a full serving (hot or cold).  The vegetable roll, miso soup, and egg roll were solid, but I will try something else next time.    Come during Happy Hour (ends at 7) if you have the chance.  The dishes we ordered were mostly the classics and they go for $5 at Happy Hour rather than $8-9 off the real menu.  Our total bill was around $55 which is unbelievable in Vegas.  Soho is top notch.",

    "text": "Wow. You know when you see a 5 star place with 10 reviews, and you're like...I wonder if those are legitimate? Well, with over 300 reviews and averaging 5 stars, you know this place is legit.  My girlfriend took me here for my birthday, and it only took literally a few minutes to see why this place was 5 stars. For me, what typically makes a 5 star restaurant is that the food is absolutely delicious, and the SERVICE goes above and beyond and offers True customer service. This place exceeded my service expectations the moment we walked in, and the food was incredible to boot!  Angelica was our waitress, and she was so nice and down to earth. We chatted with her for awhile, and some of the first things she asked were \"is this your first time?\" And \"are you from around here?\" Which in my opinion is great customer management and a VERY good indicator that they're looking to take care of their local regulars.   We ordered off of the HH (4pm-6pm everyday) menu because it was just priced so damn well we couldn't help it. While waiting, numerous waiters came by asking if it was our first time, and they were genuinely excited for us to try different things on the menu. We felt like guests of honor even though we were 1 of maybe 7 tables.   We also were a bit chilly because of the AC, so when I was in the bathroom my girlfriend ran to the car and got our sweatshirts. We put them on, and then I noticed our waitress and another waiter walking around the restaurant together. She came back a few minutes later, and said they were really sorry, they realize the AC wind was pretty strong and they turned the system down. Talk about the details!  Now for the food...  We had the gyoza, which I thought were delicious mostly because of the sauce they used. Their was a heavy lime taste to it,  and it was addicting! The stuffing inside was pretty good, and it was fried perfectly.   For sushi, we got the spicy tuna, firecracker roll, salmon avocado, and shrimp tempura. Next time we will definitely do some sashimi as according to others that's his specialty.  All the rolls were very good and fresh, and the spicy tuna actually had a bit of a kick to it! Usually spicy tuna is barely spicy, but it was spicy enough my girlfriend didn't want more than one....more for me :)  We also got the tuna and salmon tostadas and they were DEVINE. I can't believe it's was 2 for a dollar in HH, REALLY!?  The chef even sent over their yuzu yellowtail special, and it was incredible!!! The tempura jalapeno, or whatever that spice crunch thing on there is, was unbelievable. Amazing spice to balance out the sweet sauce and butter like fish. Truly worth the trip for.   They finished it off with adorable sushi and bento box key chains for my girlfriend and I, I have NEVER seen a restaurant do that. Key chains?! Now we both have them as a constant reminder of that awesome meal. Brilliant.   We will be back again....many many times. It's just too good, too fresh, the service is too friendly and too considerate...I just can't NOT eat here regularly. This is how a restaurant should be run.   Thank you again Angelica, you really made my birthday extra special!",

Poki Tostadas and Baked mussels. The baked mussels here taste so fresh compared to other Japanese restaurants I've been to in town.   It's True what they say, where there is no AYCE sushi, it's gotta be GOOD!   There are so many other things we've had here that all taste amazing, as there are many more we'd love to try in the future.",

It's clean and they have nice servers, but most of all the food was awesome!  We had lunch so we thought we were limited to the lunch menu, but our server brought the dinner menu out and we were able to order from there.  The lunch menu is pretty good, but the dinner menu has so much more to select from.  They had great lunch specials like the salmon avocado roll for only $6. We ordered the seabass lettuce buttercups from dinner menu $12, super delish!  My husband ordered the sashimi lunch special for $10.95 and it came with soup, salad & good portion of sashimi.  I ordered the Teriyaki chicken lunch special for $8.95.  The chicken is white meat and the sauce is served on the side which I liked.  The chef owner brought us the seared Garlic Tuna on the house.  We ordered so much stuff, you really can't go wrong with the sushi here.",

Green tea creme brulee is just perfect.   Happy hour menu is superb. Very inexpensive given the quality and generous food portion here.   Good service, friendly nice staff  What else do I need say....I don't need to go to any other Japanese restaurants after I discovered this place. Yum yum!!!",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 15' * 13/100  One of my friends raved about SoHo and suggested we meet here to catch up. If you must know, I've been keeping a close eye on restaurant hygiene after a few unpleasant creepy-crawly incidents in Chinatown over the summer which allowed me to notice that the place was spotless, simple and minimally decorated. The last time we went, they seemed to be short on staffed so we did not really mind them taking a while on the orders.   What they lacked for in their service that day, they made up for in their food. I ordered the seared tuna salad, a little pricey for greens at first glance but you would soon understand why. It is served as a bundle of microgreens with a special citrusy dressing, tuna sashimi seared perfectly to crispiness on its sides and sprinkled with deep fried onion pieces. I was in salad heaven! For such a healthy serving of vegetables, it does not fail to impress and I just had to go back again earlier this afternoon to order the exact same thing!  On the other hand, my friend ordered the tonkatsu curry - my usual bento favorite - from the lunch specials and she had great things to say. It came with miso soup, a small bowl of vegetables and rice. (For options such as salmon teriyaki, an order also comes with edamame and a delicious garlic sauce).They closely rival the bento boxes at RA on the Strip in portion size and price but SoHo clearly has a larger pool of options for lunch which makes it a more attractive spot. Can't go wrong with all these 4-5 star reviews!",

    "text": "How can a place have 200+ reviews and defy the law of Yelp averages and have FIVE STARS???   I see why now.  I came for lunch on a Saturday. The place is very unassuming and doesn't try to be hip or cool. There was no wait at 3PM, and it definitely doesn't feel like you're in Vegas, which is fine with me. The quality, presentation, and flavors of the food were quite another thing. The lunch boxes are a STEAL, and even the specialty rolls and sashimi are competitively priced, especially for what you are getting. We ordered the standard recommendations from other reviews and loved everything. The cherry on top is that Chef John is SUPER NICE. He literally does come to all the tables, say hi to everyone, and then offered you specials on the house after asking about your food preferences. I don't think the Tai and Uni he brought out for us was even on the menu, he just made it because Tai was fresh for the day, and we said we liked sashimi and uni. Wow.   To get: Tadas, lunch sashimi, Scallop ume, Sunrise roll, anything that comes out of that kitchen really  Before we left, the Chef brought us another complimentary dish (we felt beyond special at this point), this time beef tartar. It was a thick cut of beef unlike any beef tartar I've tried, and it was expertly sauced and oh so yummy.  I (and my table of 6) am beyond impressed, and we would highly recommend all you weekend warriors (new word I learned!) from LA to drive your asses off strip and check out this place. 1000000x better than a buffet. You won't regret it.",

Had the lunch special that came with a salad, side of cucumbers, steamed rice, 4 piece of spicy tuna roll (by the way the roll dimension was the size of a quarter. Not exaggerating)  There was nothing spectacular about any part of my lunch at all.    Service was terrible.  Walked in, waited at the front, not sure if I was supposed to seat myself.  Waited for anyone to even make eye contact but all the staff seemed too busy to even notice. Finally walked up to one of the servers and she sat me at the bar.  Took a while for a server to come take my order.  Once I ordered it.  Took a while to get my food.  They dropped off my food and not a single server stopped by to see how I was doing.  No One!    I ate everything, because I was starving.  Was up for 5 hours running errands and didn't have anything to eat.  Everything was below average.  Fish did not seem fresh to me. Salad and cucumber was tasteless, miso soup tasted  like all soy sauce based.  The steam rice was good. But I wish I had ordered the Chicken Katsu lunch instead.  Was still hungry, but  I can't eat just steam rice plain.   Why would you serve a bowl of steam rice with sushi anyways?  To sum it up...this place is FAR from 5 stars.  It's lacking in every department.  Oh and I their credit card machine was down so the server told me that she had to write down my credit card number and enter it later.  Geez.   There isn't any reason I could think of to bring me back here.  Goyemon is and has always been my favorite.  I just wanted to see what all this 5 star rating hype was all about.  And I'm sorry but this is a completely misleading...5 star?  More like 5 NOs!!!!",

    "text": "Best HH spot for sushi. The $1 sushi tostadas-octopus, yellowtail, tuna poke, and salmon are a steal! Also, love the fried baby octopus with what tasted like a curry aioli (guessing the dip). The miso black cod in lettuce wraps were good but it was a tease with the small piece of fish. All compliment well with the $3 Asahi draft beer.  Being the fat asses we are when it comes to sushi, we had ordered the non HH items too - ivory salmon, yellowtail yuzu, scallop sashimi, and uni duo which comes with two different types of uni. The sashimi didn't disappoint! The Santa Barbara uni is incredible! The best I've had so far in Vegas. The Catalina uni was OK but that's just a matter of personal preference. Pretty much all of the dishes I've had there were excellent and fresh.  The servers there are also nice and welcoming which makes this place rock even more!",

We came in close to closing time and they welcomed us in without acting like we were going to be keeping them. A family came in even later than us and they received the same warm greeting. Right away we got a good vibe because the servers didn't act like us being late was a problem.   Now the food. Man everything was perfect. We had tempura king crab, firecracker roll, and the bone in short rib. Everything was delicious. We were not even hungry but we demolished everything. If you don't get anything else get the short rib. That's a winner right there. Id wait in line (but there isn't one) for an hour for that.  Service 5 stars. Food 5 stars. Atmosphere/cleanliness 5 stars.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Soho but like all things approached with high expectations, there is room for let downs.  First let me say that I enjoyed everything - from the comfy chairs to the friendly service to the quality of food.  It's great all around.  The kitchen is even willing to cater to your specific needs, even if it is off menu.  I love this kind of accommodation.  As for the food, there were some hits and misses.  Sorry I forgot to take a photo of my chicken katsu lunch seto box and shrimp tempura, but these were the items I was quite disappointed with.  The breading on the tempura wasn't great, as well as the chicken katsu.  It was dry and the coating didn't stick very well.  The miso soup had great flavor but was extremely salty (and I have a salty palette).    The exceptional items were the green tea tiramisu (although I wish it was served more chilled) and the sushi which had good quality fish and great ratio of fish to the rice.  The Cajun albacore sashimi was also of good quality, but the sauce I didn't enjoy very much.  I think it would appeal to folks who love fusion ingredients and sauces in their sushi.  I prefer more traditional flavors.  If you love fusion sushi, you will adore this place.  And if you are more of a sushi conservative, I'm pretty sure you can still get what you want if you ask them to make it.",

    "text": "Seriously if you're lucky enough to be in the area-- order the $25 sashimi platter!  Extremely fresh, and decorated in a way to rival a $30+ platter at another establishment.  We actually ordered two (for a party of 3) among other dishes because the sashimi was THAT good.  It included tuna, salmon, yellowtail, squid,  and another I cannot recollect.    Anyways, a breakdown of what we ordered (spending upwards $200 at the end of the night):  * Sashimi Platters - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#lRndlLck8p7kFRYKUOGLpg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> As previously mentioned.  BEST DEAL HERE.  Highly recommend.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, but the second time around the chef included salmon from Japan.  And yes the freshness and clarity of the fish was palpable.    * Uni Trio - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#A-cEeA7g_oBrHePLhVYqHw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a>  the BEST uni I've had in my life.  Tasted uni from Santa Barbara (my favorite, most creamy), Hokkaido (lighter in taste), and Santa Cruz.  Obsessed with uni now.  Highly recommend to order here.  * Black Miso Cod - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#mkLPaL6yBH25O4j9LBU_fA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a>  Having been spoiled with the black miso cod at Nobu (OMG) this cod was still good but not the same, obviously.  This one was sweeter -- less flaky, but still delicious, nonetheless.  I'd order it again.  Good price as well.  * Tuna Box Sushi - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#B8cYzwavrjey4z4lYijV6g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> cripsy rice on the bottom, ebi on top, with tuna, avocado and cucumber in the center.  Delicious!  Love that cripsy rice.  *Angus Beef Gyoza - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#K4BF-OMDtLNtSE8AZDEBxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> Came paired with a tangy orange fusion gyoza sauce; the meat tasted like pork and wasn't flavored enough.  Crispy gyoza skin however  * Edamame - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#jiZ3cajCe4KnyS-UNwLpUg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> For $3 this is a steal; though it is painfully typical the edamames were hot, fresh, crunchy, and perfectly salted.  Came paired with a dipping sauce as well  * Yellow Tail Tartare - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#TGhWeKEhDZEV_0anzOoK2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> BURSTING with flavor, it didn't even need wasabi.  Beautifully presented as well.  Craving it right now  * Tuna Tartare - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#VytauQePvWEGvPbMcLQ-wA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a>  strong tuna taste with no negative connotation.  Spices blended well with the fish  * Blueberry Cheesecake with peanut butter brittle - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#5aTrN0Hc64-0aSaLG7UukA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> Unfortunately tasted like something you'd purchase at Costco (supersized, in that case).  I'd pass.  * Tiramisu - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#lJRio-aBk1Yhl5uH9fkVKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/soho...</a> so delicious; light, fluffy, fragrant, and strong chocolate tones that taste authentic and not chalky  Service is excellent, seating are is on the smaller side but you can always sit at the bar (which is what we did).  Definitely coming back!  A RARE 5-star review on my end!",

    "text": "It's not like John and Soho Sushi need another great review.  He's already created the BEST sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.  However, there's one part of John's creative genius that is not on the menu.  If you have an opportunity to spend $30-$40 per person on Sushi ask for the Omakase.  John will treat you to a Japanese feast like no other sushi restaurant.   Every time my wife and I go to Vegas, we have a meal at Soho Sushi.  And each time the Omakase is a feast.  On this day, my wife, sister and I were treated to the following 8-course meal:  1. Yellowtail with Yuzu sauce (Just the best way to open a meal) 2. Hirame with Uni 3. Ocean Trout with Ikura 4. Garlic seared White Fish 5. Hamachi Kama (The absolute largest I've ever had) 6. Bone in Short Rib (not Sushi, but succulent and tender) 7. Maguri Negi Toro with Black Caviar and Gold Leaf (Yes, you read that right...gold leaf!!!) 8. Green Tea Creme Brule with Mango Mochi Ice Cream  It's not enough that each course was an extraordinary surprise, but the best tasting food we had during this trip.  The cost was $30/person.  If you're ever in Las Vegas, this has to be a required visit.  The only other seafood restaurant we go to during our trips to Vegas is Aquaknox at the Venetian, but at that point it's $100/person.  I've eaten at Kabuto in Las Vegas Chinatown, Sushi Den in Denver, Morimoto's in New York and Hawaii, Katsu-ya in LA, and numerous other Sushi restaurants throughout the U.S.  Soho Sushi is number one in my list of Sushi Restaurants.   You also can ask for special orders.  If John has it, he will serve it with great flair and quality.  The fish is fresh and tastes excellent.",

We arrived with no reservation and we were seated within 5 minutes pretty good for a Friday night. The building isn't to large so if your looking to bring a big party it would be a little cramped depending on how many people are already inside, but the atmosphere is awesome and very romantuc. If your looking for alot of options you won't really get that as far as sushi goes I only saw one dedicated page and the amount of drink options was also low, but they do have the best miso soup I have ever had. Defenetly a place for a date but if you want alot of options there's better places out there.",

First off, service was great, it seems that every server there was helping us out. Very friendly staff, and so was the owner. Waited a little long to be seated but, the place was packed and everyone was busy. So it was understandable.   I had the Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll, Fire Cracker roll, Yellowtail Sashimi (which had deep friend jalapenos on top!), and Garlic Tuna Tataki. All of the fish was very fresh. But I think my favorite of all the dishes I tried were the tostadas, salmon, hamachi, and tuna. My favorite being the tuna but all bursting with flavor! To top it off, got to wash all this down with Yuzu sake. All food totally worth the price. I need to come back for happy hour for sure. Keep up the great work!",

AMAZING.   ... BUT THE TOSTADA CHIPS. I literally craved it for days after having it. I only had the ahi tuna but I could have had about twenty of those things and it be the only thing I had all day, and I would be completely happy. SO. GOOD.

During happy hours you get the best sushi in Vegas for 1/3 of the price - you gotta try it!",

    "text": "I have to agree with the other reviews and say, great place for a fusion take on sushi, but def not as cheap as you'd think.   For instance, the HH menu seems reasonable bc everything is 3-6$, but for what you get, a bit pricey.   I.e.,  -Sashimi tostadas are a dollar, each. the hamachi salsa verde tostada was delightful, interesting flavors, freshness of fish was average.  - Black cod lettuce cups are 4, for two cups, which are basically a bite each with a piece of cod the size of an eraser.  I'm used to tender, buttery whitefish at home (chiliean sea bass, cod, etc), so I wasn't super impressed. Tasted for the most part-- salty.   I'd def go for the cold sashimi plates, the waitress said it was their specialty.  The cajun albacore was fresh and tasty, not super pricey, but not a great value either $12. (see pic)   ** I have yet to try the typical sashimi fishes, so I can't comment on the freshness of fish**   Can't vouch for any rolls except their spicy tuna roll ($4), and was pretty disappointed, flavorless and super mushy.    Uni was tasty. not super well versed, but it was 12$ for 4 pieces of the Santa Barbara Uni Sashimi. (cheapest type)  The service was super, you could ask anything there to help you out, and they were laid back and not in your face.    Overall, interesting flavors, not a super great value, decently fresh fish, but perhaps not for the sushi purist.",

My choices are tried & True - hamachi sashimi, something toro (tuna) and something tempura - along with edamame and sunumono. A real treat was the diaginjo sake - cool and smooth in 350ml bottles. Next time, green tea brulee for dessert. Carry on!",

The first server we had was terrible, but it turns out it was his first day.  All the other servers are super knowledgeable and awesome.   The prices are super reasonable for the quality of food.  The Chef used to be the Executive Chef of Social House on the strip so he knows all the vendors and gets top notch ingredients.  The hubby is super sensitive to uni and if it's just a smidge not fresh he will pick up on it and claim it to be \"fishy\" or \"too slimy\".  He RAVED about the uni here and even ordered himself seconds!  Trust, this has never happened before (not even at Raku or Kabuto or Yonaka).  The chef is dedicated to making sure his food is extremely fresh and clean tasting.   We tried the yellowtail, the tostadas, beef tataki, angus gyoza, butter lettuce cod, and crispy rice tuna roll.  All were amazing, especially the yellowtail, tuna poke tostada, and cod (as well as some other nigiri and sashimi we had).  I would pass on the gyoza and crispy rice.  Gyoza was limp (and I guess I still prefer traditional pork) and a tad too greasy.  Crispy rice roll is a great concept, just didn't care for the actual crispy rice.  It was kind of stale and not crisp.    Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu - they also have HH.  The toastadas are only $1 each.  I might just have to go and get like 10 of the ahi poke toastadas.",

When I looked at all the five star reviews on Yelp, I thought, \"there's no way...there's got to be a catch.\" Yes way and no catch. This is the real deal!  Driving there and driving up to the place didn't help. It's about 20 minutes to what seems like the middle of nowhere. It's in a nondescript strip mall. The place looks like (in a previous life) it might have been a Five Guys burger joint or Denny's with a new paint job.   The people could not have been nicer or more cheerful. They highly recommended the sashimi specials so we went with the flow, tempted as we were to just stick to our sushi staples.  Wow! Just wow! The first garlic tuna was really good. Next, they brought us the yellowtail. One problem, we didn't order yellowtail. The waiter was like, \"Dude, you gotta try this!\" The verdict - more yellowtail and make it snappy! We ordered four things off the sashimi menu and when we were done, ordered four more. We could have said, \"surprise us\" and I'm 100% certain we would have been surprised and delighted. How many places can you say that about. And it was very reasonably priced (there's NO place on the strip you can say that about)  Of all the same old same old on the strip, there are two places in Vegas that just blow them all away - Soho and Raku. We'll be back!  HUGE star and mouth muscle straining smiley face!",

I had my friend order, as she had been to Soho many times, and claims this spot as one of her all time favorite spots.. and I dont blame her!  Their Ocean Trout, out of this world.  who makes sashimi with pop rock candy... chef john does!  Yes, it sounds a bit absurd... but pure genius!  It was literally poppin and rockin in my mouth!   Four words... Hydro Bibb Black Cod.  Amazing!  Its marinated in a miso glaze, so it gives the fish a sweet finish!  They're serve in little cute butter lettuce cups. A definite new favorite!  Yellow tail sashimi was PERFECT! Its served with little tempura jalapeno , and set on the sashimi.  Each bite, pure heaven!  All of their sashimi is the freshest I've ever had in Vegas! Coming from Hawaii, I'm a bit picky when it comes to where I eat my sashimi, because I'm used to freshly caught fish in Hawaii. At Soho, its clear that their motto is QUALITY!  What draws me to this place, other than the fact that their food is AMAZING, is the customer service.  We were personally approached by the Chef/Owner himself.  He reiterated our order, and by that he was able to get a feel of what our taste buds were like.  He said that as a courtesy, he was going to bring out a complimentary sashimi dish, on the house.  It was a black sea bass w/ truffle and olive oil. OMG. it was soooooo delicious! First of all, he didn't have to do that... that was truly nice of him to do!   The vibe, the food and location is perfect.  I will definitely be back!",

Once they know your tastes, they surprise you with unique things to try that aren't on the menu. Tonight we got a Big Eye Tuna sashimi plate - such a nice surprise. We also got my standard favorites: Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, Miso Marinated Black Cod, Cajun Albacore with Serrano Chili and Ponzu Aioli, Ika Geso (Fried octopus) 2 orders, all the Tadas, and the Bone-in Angus Short Rib. And it was happy hour, and I drank the white peach infused Sake, and I left full and happy. And I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I waited till my second visit to rate Soho 5 stars after having dinner and their happy hour.  Chef John literally delivers a strip-like Social House experience for a fraction of the price in a neighborhood setting.  A well-known friend chef of mine not to be named told me they took almost the entire menu and brought it to Soho - he frowned a little upon this but I have no issues with it.  The locals benefit from it and they put out one of the best happy hours in town.  The dollar tostastas are so addicting.   I feel like a child ordering 6 and 12 pack taco's from Taco Bell but this is obv much more refined, elevated cuisine.  My favorite is the salmon tostata but they are all good.  We got one of each as they offer 4 selections.   The rest of the happy hour has a cajun albacore sashimi, black cod lettuce wraps (YUM), and several roll selections.   The rice on the rolls were a little under seasoned but overall everything was good.  The waiter recommended the bacon wrapped kurobata sausages.  They reminded me of little smokey's.   I wasn't a fan at first but it was greatt paired with the pickled cucumber.  The rest of the HH items are all priced between $3-5 per item.    As for dinner, I came on another trip and i was really impressed with their beef tataki.  It's 100 times better than Tonkatsu Kiyoshi's version and a level or too better than Kyara's.   I love their ocean trout topped with rock salt - love the textures and freshness of the dish.   We also ordered the beef short ribs, a Yelp favorite, live uni, oysters, and on my most recent trip i sampled their king crab topped with a little butter and hint of garlic.  Everything here is great!  For dinner you won't find your yum yum roll here - This is more about the fish.  Chef John says that he gets his fish from the same supplier as most of the sushi spots on the strip so you literally are paying a fraction of what you would at Social House!",

Another couple complains & is told that they were waiting at a nearby bar & she calls them by cell when their tables are ready. So she says can we just sit here & order? And is told yes!!!

Service is wonderful everywhere you sit, but if you sit at the bar more than once the chefs will get to know you and they'll make you feel like Norm walking into Cheers every time you show up. They remember your preferences, bring you dishes to sample that they think you might like, and generally just treat you like an old friend. And the sushi is so so good. I'm a recent transplant from the SF Bay Area and was a little concerned that good sushi wouldn't be as easy to find as I'm used to. I've never been so happy to be so wrong. Soho easily competes with the best sushi places I've been to in SF, and their prices are better. I could spend paragraphs gushing about everything I love about this place, but I'll save us all some time by summarizing: Eat here. Eat here today. Eat here tomorrow. Eat here as often as you can.",

We came during the evening of 5-15-14...  When I walked in, I was surprised at the casual / non traditional setting. Don't let it fool you! The fish was exceptional. We sat at the bar & asked the chef to surprise us. He quickly provided us with carefully paired pieces of fish; we had salmon, yellowtail, butterfish... Each one was delicious. For \"dessert\" I like to finish with either Toro or Uni; we tried 3 different types of Uni. The chef was super friendly and very kind. The Uni was fantastic (of the 3 options, the Japanese was our favorite).  Service is good but I would recommend sitting at the bar to enjoy the good company of the chefs! Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be back. Don't bother with the restaurants on the strip.... This is a quality sushi restaurant with great value. Our bill was under 100$ and we were drinking and had lots of food. Totally worth it. Oh and we got pens with little sushi-s on the end! I'll treasure them forever while I dream of the Hoakkido Uni........",

    "text": "This is my favorite Sushi place in Las Vegas.  I used to be a big fan of AYCE sushi and ate at places such as Goyemon, Xtreme Sushi, Oyshi, Yama Sushi, Kaya, etc., but after eating here, none of the places come close in terms of quality fish.  I've probably eaten here around 20-30 times in less than half a year, and the quality of fish is CONSISTENT. Also there lunch prices are pretty much unbeatable. 7 Pieces of Sashi, Miso Soup, Rice, Spinach / Romaine Salad, and Cucumbers for $8.50. There's also a variety of other dishes to choose from, such as chicken, beef teriyaki, and loco moco, etc.  Chef John used to work at Social House down the strip, and decided to open his own restaurant a year ago. The fish he gets are the same fish that the casino gets because he uses the same supplier. After talking with John on the last visit, the tuna he buys costs him $15 per pound wholesale, and the quality is very high. Their UNI is imported from California and it costs $30 for 6 pieces, but it's a thing I'm glad to have done for my Bucket List because it was the best Uni I've ever had in my life.   I've seen John on every visit, and he works there 6 days a week. He is always   cheerful and happy when making his fish, and if it's your first visit, he may come out to greet you and, sometimes, he'll send a free dish your way. How many sushi restaurants do that? I can tell you, it is very few.  Also, one other thing you will notice is the way the fish is stored and wrapped. This is the only sushi restaurant that I have seen the fish wrapped in 3-4 layers of saran wrap. The wrapping is so tight, sometimes you can't tell what fish is underneath until they start unwrap. The cut for the portions are also huge compared to nigiri cuts.  Little things like this tell you how they handle their fish and cleanliness.  When the environment slows down, the staff is also some of the best personnel I've seen. The speed in which they respond to something is ridiculous. Several times, I broke the paper on my straw, slipped it into my drink, and the server, on her way back to the kitchen took my straw paper. The attention to cleanliness is extremely high at this restaurant. The only poor experience I had the first few times was getting my check. It always took longer than when I finished my food, but that is negligible compared to the whole dining experience.   Writing this review is making my mouth water, and I'll definitely be stopping by again today!  P.S. the only thing you will struggle with is the wait. If you are in a rush DO NOT GO at 5:30-6:30 PM for dinner. The wait might be 1 hour. Call in and make reservations first.",

Shrimp, Octopus, and Tuna Tostadas. Sooooo good. All of their tostadas are made differently. Extra variety!  Baked Mussels, not the best overall taste I've had, but the mussels themselves were fantastic.  Octopus Nigiri and Spicy Scallop Handroll were delicious. The Firecracker Roll was good. However my most favorite... Was that damn Crispy Tuna Roll. Holy crap.  Cucumber Salad, Miso, and Toban Seafood Soup were nice little side dishes. The chef also provides a free sashimi dish... You'll just have to find out what ;)  But.  To top it off? Dessert.  Green Tea Tiramisu. And Green Tea CREME.BRULEE. Jesus.  No really. Just Jesus.  The service was awesome. Very nice waitresses and waiters. Didn't get personal with the chefs despite sitting at the bar, but the atmosphere is super friendly.  Verdict? YE!!!!!!!!  Coming again, soon.",

The green tea tiramisu has to be reviewed by itself...it's to die for!!!i would gladly go back just to eat this!   The staff is super friendly and very very attentive from the moment we stepped in!   To sum it all up, this is definitely in my top 3 fave japanese restaurant !   Did I mention that it's just around the corner from my house?? SCORE!!!!",

It got crowded as the night went on. Luckily we were there right before the rush. Our waitress was really nice and helpful.

I highly recommend the kumamoto oysters with uni, even though it cost $6/each, but definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I'm visiting from LA, where we may have a good sushi place or two.  But I found this restaurant on Yelp, and off I went, thinking I'd look more toward meat items, as I'd eaten at another sushi restaurant the night before.  When I pulled up to the restaurant, admittedly I was a bit worried, because the signage made me think cookie cutter strip mall Japanese restaurant.  (Usually, when I think Japanese restaurant in a strip mall, I feel more comfortable if it looks like a dive.)  But generic outside appearance aside, this restaurant holds its own with some of the top restaurants of its kind in LA, and brought to mind restaurants like Wa and the original Katsu-ya.  I began with a house specialty, yellowtail sashimi with just enough tempura jalapeno in a garlic and yuzu-based sauce, before moving on to beef tataki, seared to a beautiful texture with a garlic chili oil.  Both were delicious and perfectly tender.  From there, the chef came out--it was wonderful to get such personal attention (and the restaurant was quite busy)--and we discussed what I might want next.  He suggested I try a white sea bass he had just gotten in, and then a trio of taro tostadas, each a combination of a different fish, spice (as in heat) and avocado cream.  They were fabulous small bites.  I finished my meal with the signature miso marinated black cod, perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful, accompanied with a yuzu-based vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly.  My primary server was quite attentive and personable (as were all the others), the setting is unpretentious and comfortable, and I didn't know until the end that Chef had graciously given me the white sea bass and tostada tastings.  That was just the cherry on top of an exceptional meal.  It won't be the cheapest Japanese meal you've ever had (though the prices are very fair for what you get, and there are good deals to be had at happy hour and lunch), and if you're a quantity over quality person, there are probably better choices, but if you appreciate top quality, extremely fresh ingredients handled deftly by a talented chef, this is your restaurant.  Even if it were in LA, Soho would still be a standout.  Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be at the top of my list.",

The food and rolls were so fresh and flavorful!  I am sad that I'm forgetting the names of the rolls we ordered.  Service is a bit slow, but I can deal with it when the food is this good.  What I LOVE about it is that the owner/chef care SO MUCH about the food!  He came to our table and asked how everything was.  As a small business owner myself, I really respect that...I care a LOT about my clients' opinions and I've been to too many places that don't.  I like that it's open late, as the hubby works nights and we can meet for a bite.",

The food alone can make your experience, however, they also have an extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff who exceed my expectations each visit.

    "text": "I read all the positive yelp reviews of this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered 3 items for takeout - it took about 35-40 minutes (which is a long wait for takeout, but in fairness they were busy and the staff was very attentive, checking in on me frequently and letting me know my food was coming soon). I ordered three items: the angus gyoza which was delicious - the dipping sauce went perfectly with the dumplings. The Sunny Salmon Roll was also great - the lemon really adds a great twist of flavor to the roll. The tuna box sushi, however, I found bland. It wasn't bad but there wasn't much flavor to the roll and it was awkwardly shaped and difficult to eat. Everything tasted very fresh (which is always a good quality when serving raw fish). I will definitely come back again!",

    "text": "This place is amazing! I must say that I have never had better sushi anywhere and I come from a place with great sushi selections. After having dinner here during my trip in Vegas, I wanted to eat here again the next day. Sadly, my friends decided to eat at other places.   We ordered so many food while we were there. We just simply wanted to try everything because everything we ordered was very delicious. They are known for their sashimi so order from their specialty selection if you are there. You will not be disappointed. When I had the ocean trout (can't remember if that's the name or something else since we ordered so many dishes), my mouth was in heaven. The fish is topped with poprocks. Yes, POPROCKS!!! It definitely added a nice touch to the fish (and childhood memories of eating poprocks).   The waitress that served us was very attentive. She recognized from our voices that we had tried to call in earlier to make reservations. All her recommendations were delicious and she provided great customer service. We ordered hot sake but were given cold sake instead. She returned and gave us a bottle of hot sake and told us the cold sake will be complimentary.  I also like that they are open to modifying our philadelphia roll with hamachi instead of salmon. Overall, I have experienced wonderful customer service and the best sushi quality here at Soho Japanese Restaurant. If the owner of Soho Japanese Restaurant is reading this review, can you please open a location in San Francisco, CA? I'm dying for your sushi. T_T  P.S. They have fresh wasabi. :)",

    "text": "No date? No friends? No problem!  The food and service is so good that it's worth going, even for just a table for one.  I decided to check out this restaurant because it had such a high rating, and being the skeptic I am, I was looking for stuff to critique.  However, the worst I can say is that their popularity has outgrown their dining space.  Even so, the wait was still less than half an hour for a table, and it was well worth the wait.  I arrived at 5:50 pm on a Saturday night, hoping I might catch a happy hour special, but the dining room was packed, and there was a wait list, so I didn't get a seat until 6:17.  The servers were surprisingly quick considering how busy they were, and they were definitely on top of the drinks and meal orders.  I ordered the Garlic Shishito Peppers appetizer, and it was quite tasty.  It had a spiciness that sneaks up on you, so the first several didn't taste hot at all, but eventually it kicks you in the face if you keep going.  After researching these peppers, I found that one expert claimed 1 in 12 is actually spicy whereas the rest are generally sweet.  I think my experience was about 1 in 5...  Even when I got a spicy one though, I'd still put them below jalapenos in heat, so if you have no problems eating jalapenos, these won't challenge you.  Also, for only $4, it's a must-order for those who enjoy spicy appetizers.  For my second appetizer, I tried the Hydro Bibb Black Cod (a good deal at just $7), which was possibly the most delicious appetizer I've ever had, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that.  The fish melts in your mouth, and the lettuce and garnish perfectly complemented the flavor that was cooked into the cod.  I just wish I had taken a photo before I devoured this dish.  If you only try one thing, make it this appetizer!  Next, I thoroughly enjoyed the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy Sashimi.  Like all their food, it was noticeably fresh, with perfectly flavored sauce, and as their signature dish is well worth the trip just on its own.  The only downside on this dish is that being sashimi, it is not going to fill you up, so you'll have plenty of room to order more.  I enjoyed an order of the edamame with my main entrees, and it was good, but nothing spectacular: standard boiled and salted soy beans (or squeezy beans as my 7-year-old niece calls them), and it came with a side dish of a sweet sauce although I prefer to eat them as is.  Finally, I ordered their signature roll, the Twin Dragon, which is definitely more of a filling main course (I couldn't finish all of mine, so I took it in a to-go box).  Its description is what you'd expect in a dragon roll: shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado, and crab meat, but it's definitely one of the better dragon rolls I've had, and the double shrimp on top with their delectable sauce made it clear why this is one of their most popular rolls.",

Soho lives up to its mission of \"strip fare for locals.\" They offer an inventive menu of cold and hot appetizers, entrees, and actual sushi, in addition to a well-thought-out sake list. On the waitress' recommendation, we had a bottle of the cold g fifty sake to share and it was quite good. Then we just split several appetizers, and all were seriously excellent: baked mussels, Cajun albacore, the famous yellowtail, and the black cod lettuce wraps. $75 for a great meal and drinks is fair to me. Next time, we'll definitely hit up happy hour (4-6).",

The chef gave us a platter of free sashimi at the end of our meal, which was more icing on our heavily iced caked. The prices are also very reasonable. This is one of the few restaurants I'd probably order solely sashimi. Most places I'd usually more rolls since I'm hesitant of what the pure fish might taste like or how fresh the fish is (like in Texas).   All the sashimi MELTS in your mouth. Maybe it's not authentic with my sashimi topped in pop rocks and swimming in ponzu sauce. I DON'T CARE. My fiance says it's probably farm raised, so that's why it's so fatty and melts in our mouth, but I DON'T CARE. I'll eat the fatty sashimi and he will too. I'll definitely be back when I'm back in Vegas.",

So when my gfffffff told me I definitely should try it out because she loved it, I dragged my mom there to grab an early dinner.. We actually came during Happy Hour so that was an added bonus!   There was a about a 10 minute wait because a large party had just left so the tables had to be broken down..no biggie! But when we were sat it was almost like we were forgotten.. Our server ended up being Sheila who was just fantastic! She was so sweet and informative. Definitely suggest sitting in her section!  -HH Cold lychee sake - served in a nice sake glass.. Not too sweet and went down smooth.. I really liked how Sheila would refill my sake cup since that is not something that is practiced at all neighborhood sushi joints.. -HH Tostadas- the yellowtail, salmon and tuna ones were so good and fresh! The kimchi Tako one was a little on the salty side. -HH Firecracker- I usually don't like deep fried rolls but this one was good and not oily! -HH spicy tuna roll & salmon avocado roll.. Fish was fresh but the rice was a bit too sweet -HH hydro bib black cod- 2 in one order.. My mom loved these.. Don't know if you're supposed to eat it like a lettuce wrap but that's what she did lol -Ume scallop- so fresh and delicious with a little bit of yuzu, tobiko and salt... mmmmmM the cilantro goes perfect with it as well -Yuzu Soy Yellowtail- at the end of the meal Sheila brought out this dish on the house since it was our first time and this is their signature dish (they did this for my gfffff too). The fish was good but it was way too cold almost like it was just defrosted.. I really appreciate them bringing out this dish for us and it says lots about their customer service!   I will definitely be back! HH is awesome and their lunch specials look good too!  HOT TIP: if they don't give you a cool sushi pen at the end of your meal.. Ask for one!",

My girlfriends and I went here - one of whom had already been and was talking it up; she was right because It did NOT disappoint!  I was revealed that the atmosphere was chill, laid back, friendly, and welcoming. Not like the stuffy sushi places closer to the strip. Our server, Charles, was friendly, funny , and prompt with our orders. There was a lot of confusion and talk about what to order. He quickly stepped in and made the suggestion that the chef could present some cold and warm dishes at his recommendation until we were full. Sold!!!  Since I can't find the menu online, I'm going to recall the dishes as best I can:  Yellowtail Yuzu Soy - Texture like butter. So fresh, you wouldn't think it was fish. Love the tempura jalapeno on top.   Gyoza - I HAVE to get gyoza at sushi time. Love this gyoza. Beef was fresh and moist. Not dried out and greasy. Very well done!   Mussels: I can't believe more people that wrote reviews didn't try this dish. Don't be afraid people!!!! These were incredible  Live soft shell crab - not actually live, but very very fresh. Crab was fried served over a bed of fancy salad (\"fancy\" meaning it wasn't just crappy iceberg lettuce). The sauce that came on the dish with this was incredible. Spicy but not too spicy. This one had a perfectly balanced textures and flavors.   Salmon Sashimi - It had pop rocks on it!!!!! So weird, but really amazing.   I wish I could remember everything we ate. The servers were great. They kept checking on our appetite level. He wasn't pushy about desert or drinks, which was nice. The price for all of us was incredibly reasonable considering the quality of the food. We walked away paying about $45/person. I consider that a steal for this place.  I had such a great experience here. I have been blabbing about it to everyone. I CANNOT wait to come back and try some new things.",

Seeing a restaurant with over 350 reviews and a perfect 5 star score is a rarity so I knew I had to investigate further.  The restaurant is located about 5 miles off the Las Vegas strip, I believe the cab ride cost around $17 coming from Mandalay Bay.  It was well worth the drive!   When we arrived it happened to be happy hour and SoHo has some GREAT Happy Hour Specials.  Everything is absolutely fantastic and fantastically priced!!  Among some of the standouts and must orders if you visit:   Black Cod Happy Hour Special is a must try, you might even order 2  Ahi Poki Tostada Happy Hour Special: you will definitely order 2 Yellow Fin with jalapeno - Fantastically delicious   Golden Trout with Pop rocks (yep, pop rocks!) Angus Beef Tataki - tastes as good as it looks Soft Shell Crab Special - breaded and fried, served with three amazing dipping sauces.  If it's available (seasonal) get it!   Bone in Short Rib - fell right off the bone.  Moist, tender and totally delicious.  Green Tea Creme Brulee to finish off the meal - no words left to describe this except a heavenly finish to an outstanding meal.    So now that I've listed almost the entire menu as \"must try\" I hope you understand the level of enthusiasm I have for this restaurant and it's food.  To add to the experience Chef John, owner and executive chef, came by to visit our table.  It was instantly apparent his love for what he does and his appreciation for good food.  His message to us was he wanted to take the Vegas dining experience off the strip and bring it to where the locals can enjoy.  I hope he plans to expand to Washington, DC!!!",

Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.  It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the \"Seared Tuna Special\" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.    I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.  Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.    Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out of the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.    The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.    Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.",

Both happy hour experiences were good in terms of service, no wait, and better price. Some happy hour items I could do without such as the sausage (too much sausage). Sounds funny but I can only take so much sausage and these are full kurobuta sausages. Ika geso is another one I could do without.   For the good-the happy hour rolls, poke tostada, and the black cod lettuce wrap.   Due to the good experiences the first 2 times we came back on a Friday night. It was packed and there was a long wait. They said 20 minutes but it ended up being about 35 minutes. The sashimi mixed plate was ordered and very good. I did not care for the scallop and I am usually a big scallop fan. It tasted fishy. The hamachi was very good.We got a soft shelled crab salad and I thought it was bland. This time they were busy and forgot my husband's beer and water refills. I know they were busy, but...   I love their green tea tiramisu!",

The place was illuminated by flame-less candles, while some of my favorite hit songs played above my table.    I got the Dynamite Roll which was Deep-fried roll filled with chopped smoked salmon & shrimp, jalapeno slices, cream cheese, and sriracha sauce. Topped with eel sauce and spicy mayo. If you like hot and spicy food, this be it!! My nose started running from the heat!   The Angry Dragon Roll had Shrimp tempura and cucumber inside, eel, avocado, spicy mayonnaise and eel sauce on top. Another prefect amount of flavors and spice.   For dessert, I had Mochi ice cream. If you do not know what that is, it is a small, round dessert ball consisting of a soft, pounded sticky rice cake on the outside and an ice cream filling on the inside.  Popular flavors are green tea, peach strawberry, so I got all of those!  Please check out this restaurant if you love sushi. The reviews aren't lying. It has amazing food",

The tables were full and we were given the option to order drinks while waiting. When the table was ready, we were served quickly and the staff is very friendly. The last time that I came here, quite a while back, I was somewhat disappointed with what we ordered. At that time, the sushi that was being ordered was not that impressive to me. I can say that that has completely changed. We started out with the yellowtail sashimi appetizer, in ponzu sauce, that was delicious. The Shishito peppers were good but quite spicy. We ordered the Seabass appetizer in lettuce wraps which was absolutely delicious and we also ordered the vegetable tempura platter. This, without a doubt, is the best tempura I have ever had. It was perfect without being overly greasy. We then ordered the rainbow roll which was delicious and I would recommend it any day. We also ordered a twin dragon roll that looked interesting on paper, having shrimp tempura with spicy tuna and a combination of a California roll all in one. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was the most popular roll ordered. This is why I did not give this review five stars. I found the role to be quite distasteful and it was not pleasant at all. My friend agreed. I would not recommend this role to anyone. How it is the most popular role is beyond me. For dessert, we tried the green tea creme brulee which was interesting. The lychee sake was amazing! This is an absolute must for anyone that likes lychee. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. I would not hesitate to go back but, likely next time, I most certainly will not be ordering the twin dragon roll or the Shishito peppers which I found way too spicy.",

Everything was inventive and well-presented. I have seen other happy hour menus and I appreciate not just the variety of choices here but also that they are one flat price of $5. Deservedly, it does seem to get busy pretty quickly as dinnertime approaches. It made my parents, who are traditionalists when it comes to Japanese cuisine, surprised and even a little impressed with the food and that you can actually go to a Japanese restaurant and not always have to order the same sushi/sashimi combo. Great place for family or dates. Will return as long as I'm in the area, for sure!",

My friends were amazed on the flavors as the experience good Japanese food as oppose to the ones they've tried before. Service was excellent.  The owner/chef came to our table and follow up on our meal and having a conversation with us.  Even offered to try a new appetizer.  Yuzu Steelhead trout.

He used to work at a high end restaurant on the strip and was able to maintain relations with the same fish source he used to work with.  The fish is all very fresh.  You can see in their sushi bar that they leave the fish in a block and only cut the fish as needed in preparing their dishes.  Though this seems like something all restaurants should do, I've found that other sushi restaurants around town don't necessarily do this.  Love, love, love the fish.  Also, the uni is excellent and also very well sourced.  This is one of the best sushi restaurants I've eaten at just short of when I lived in Tokyo.    Creative dishes.  They are constantly trying new flavor combinations.  Prices here are amazing for the fish quality you get.  Definitely coming back.",

It is not an \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi restaurant, but the quality of the food is outstanding; the sushi and sashimi are fresh, and the portion of the lunch boxes will not disappoint!!!    In addition, this unique restaurant will have a live guitarist playing at the restaurant on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights starting at 6pm until 9pm!!!

    "text": "I adore Soho. My husband and I travel to Vegas on business twice a year for several weeks at a time, and lately I have found so much delight in the gems located off the strip rather than on. Soho was one of the best finds we stumbled upon. The quality of ingredients at this sushi restaurant are top-notch. While ALL sushi restaurants really need to ensure their food served is of the utmost quality and freshness, sadly this isn't the case. But no worries with Soho.   We ordered several appetizers (including the rock shrimp with dipping sauces, omg!), seaweed salad, edamame, miso soup, sashimi and then a bunch of rolls for our dinner. While a \"veggie roll\" is not very exciting nor is it ever really worth mentioning - theirs was so good I nearly fell off my seat. The asparagus used inside the roll was SUPER crunchy and I honestly thought they executed this normally bland roll perfectly. Also, the crispy crab roll was one of the best I have ever had in my life.  I would also like to mention that the owner/chef was by far the nicest gentlemen I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He came by our table several times to ensure we were having a good time -- he sent the sashimi compliments -- and he also came by and asked us if we wanted dessert on the house. We said no as he was already too generous, but what a great person and what an amazing experience!",

There's nothing I can say about this menu that has not been said before.   The fish is so fresh and so amazing.  I love the salmon avocado roll. The The avocado is always so fresh and melts in your mouth. I have three different tadas which are crispy wontons with avocado and fish on top. I've tried the salmon, tuna, and tako (octopus). Normally I love salmon, but in the tada version, I love the tuna. The tako tastes kind of like shrimp ceviche. That might be because of the pico de gallo that is on that tada.   We also ordered the Cajun Albacore Sashimi which tasted awesome! The fish was just so fresh and so amazing. Everything melted in my mouth. My friend ordered the Hydro Bibb Black Cod. That was 2 really small pieces on a bed of lettuce. It was not that great tasting. It also tasted a bit sweeter.   The one thing I would not recommend is the soho maki. It's like a really long egg roll. For egg roll fans, it'd be great. However, it's not something I would want at a sushi restaurant. It did taste great, and came with sweet and sour sauce, but I thought it be more fishy. The description mention shrimp and other things, so I thought it would contain more shrimp.   The servers were very friendly, and they took our order quickly. They cleared all our plates once we were done. They didn't even rush us out when we finished eating.",

I also appreciated the low lunch prices that were to be had. Our group of five enjoyed a variety of dishes mostly off of the $8.95 bento box lunch specials. Steak, salmon and sushi samplers were all around us, there was so much food it could only with the uttermost care fit on our table. We also got two rolls, the double dragon and albacore. I felt these were well made because they had a thinner rice covering than is usual but other than that they were the usual sushi roles I have come to expect at regular joints. Sometimes I am wowed by sushi places with bold flavors or unique presentations such as sushi samba this was more of a regular but solid feel.",

I had the sashimi platter which couldn't have been fresher nor higher quality.  They have a large team of Japanese cooks and we saw many Japanese patrons which indicates that this is the real deal in terms of Japanese cuisine.    Furthermore, I couldn't believe the price.  My daughter had two sushi rolls and miso soup.  I had a sashimi platter and tempura shrimp and veggies.  My wife had miso soup and a special veggie plate and our total bill was $59.  This place is such a winner.  I wish we had it in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "How does some place like this have a 5 star AVERAGE? I came in thinking that it definitely inflated as there isn't really anything else like in in the area. I left feeling pleasant after a good meal so while it may be inflated, I am a believer that the food is good.  We were in the neighborhood and decided to come by for lunch.   The fiance and I share a few plates -   Beef teriyaki set lunch - I like that they use sliced steak for this and not thin shaved meat. It's much better quality than most offer. It comes with a mix green salad (not just iceburg), miso, pickled cucumbers and rice which were standard, but solid.   Spicy tuna roll - just wanted something simple and this filled the request. It was cut and made well.   Soho -tadas get a lot of buzz so we both got a yellowtail one. This was yummy, I enjoyed the avocado cream on it.   Compliments of the chef we got yellowtail yuzu which was great quality fish and I enjoyed the texture of the fried jalapenos and use of coarse finishing salt on it.   So based on the food, they are an above average Japanese food spot, but what really stood out for me was the service! Our drinks were topped off in such a intuitively quick manner which was appreciated on this hot summer afternoon. Both guys checking on our table were friendly to boot and was personable cracking jokes with us. The chef/owner came out to check on everyone which I always feel is a nice touch  and he seemed genuinely humble.   On a second visit it was raining and our server (guy with longish hair and glasses) took his apron off and covered customers and walked them to their car. That is a absolute gentleman going above and I really respect that.   I am enamored with the friendly staff and enjoyed my lunch both occassions that I most definitely will be back when I'm in the area to see more of what this place has to offer.",

I had the Shrimp tempura - with three dipping sauces to great.  But the highlight for me were the amazing little tostadas - I had a white fish one with Shiso pesto INCREDIBLE  And the shrimp and mango - also perfectly balanced and you just want to order ten more!   If you're in Vegas check this place out - no ambiance in a shitty little strip mall but SO worth it!",

The staff was really friendly (Charles was GREAT!) and the sushi bar chairs were really comfy. We started with edamame which was delicious because it comes out hot and flaked in big chunks of sea salt with a sweet chili dipping sauce. We ordered the Salmon Sashimi with Wasbi Creme next and it was delicious. While we were still trying to decide what to get next, the owner and head chef John overheard us telling our server that it was our first time. He asked what kind of fish we liked and we said Yellowtail Tuna. He immediately sent out a complimentary Jalepeno Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer. It was AMAZING! The fish was really fresh and melt in your mouth.  We ordered the King Crab roll which has all of our favorites; crab, avocado, cucumber, spicy tuna and FRESH HOT shrimp tempura on top. It was probably the best roll we have had in Vegas. Again, really fresh. I usually smother my rolls in sauces and jalepenos but this roll didn't need anything else!  We also ordered the Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll and it was good, not as good as the first but definitely really fresh and delicious.  They have small plates on happy hour too that are really good and really great priced. Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back, even though it is a drive for us!",

    "text": "most of the time my friends and I would eat at all you can eat sushi spots, trying to maximize our bang for the buck, usually sacrificing quality for quantity and price. With that said, Soho Japanese Restaurant is one of the best sushi places i've ever had, not only in Las Vegas, but anywhere. Just to get other logistics out of the way, the staff is friendly, prompt, and the Sushi Chef was highly knowledgeable and very catering to our requests.   The fish is unbelievably amazing. every cut, whether it be sushi or sashimi, was excellent in taste, texture, and \"freshness\"  We tried four different Cold Sashimi dishes, all which exceeded my expectations. As well, I am not usually a Uni fan, but after listening to the Chef's explanation of different kinds of Uni, and trying his specific Uni, i realized I never liked Uni because no one ever knew how to prepare it before. the uni at Soho is GREAT.   The tostada chips are perfect in size, and great on taste. Highly recommend the Mackrel as well. Currently, there ivory salmon is in season. Chef hooked it up with a great  portion that I highly recommend.   The pieces of sashimi you get for 5 dollars is outstanding. Definitely recommend getting that over sushi. For how good the fish is, I feel like I'm ripping chef off for only paying 5 bucks for each fish.   Happy hour has great deals (only 1 dollar a taco, asahi draft for 3.)   Overall, I just can't stop raving about the quality and taste of the food here. Easily my favorite sushi spot in vegas, maybe anywhere. If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.   Favorites: salmon wasabi, ocean trout, tuna tostadas  Salute to you chef john",

The menu has a bunch of items like sushi rolls, mini tostadas, sashimi, and appetizers around the $1-7 range. Everything here is fresh.   I especially like the firecracker roll. It has spicy tuna, cream cheese, and jalapeno lightly deep fried in tempura. I normally don't desire deep-fried rolls, but the tempura casing is more crunchy than breaded.   Chef Lee is absolutely friendly and makes time to meet his diners. I've been on more than one occasion and he makes it a point to remember his diners. I really enjoy this personal touch.  The restaurant isn't big, but it's never been too busy to get seated. Try Soho during happy hour and if you like it, give the rest of Chef Lee's menu a shot.",

We visited on a Thursday night started with the Kumamoto oysters and mix sashimi platter. The mix sashimi platter for 25$ is an amazing value, superb quality, and surprisingly voluminous assortment of yummy fish. The oysters, yellowtail, beef capriccio all 5 stars and with a delightfully pleasing presentation. The bone in short ribs - amazing!!!!!!!!!! The double dragon roll was well prepared and tasty. The green tea tiramisu was terrific.  This not an all-you-can-eat sushi joint - or a come-all sushi roll house with chicken teriyaki.  It's a high quality and adventurous sashimi house with a flare. If you have an adventurous palate, it is the place for you. The staff was overwhelming in friendliness, knowledge, and attentiveness.   I forgot ..... They use real crab in their sushi rolls not the fake stuff found in 90% of the sushi houses in Las Vegas. I will be back !!!!!",

    "text": "This week was all about reconnecting with friends. Tonight a few of us decided to take a drive and visit Soho as we've heard some amazing things! So good, I noticed they had an average of 5 stars with over 250 reviews! WOW! That's amazing. I'm always up for new places, especially ones with amazing reputations. What I didn't realize was how amazing this place was going to be!  This restaurant is located on the Southwest side Las Vegas in an up and coming area. New homes and business are opening every single month. Soho is located in a strip mall a couple of blocks south of the 215. Once you enter, you'll notice a very small location. A few tables in the main dining room and a sushi bar around the corner. The prominent color in this joint is red, but not an obnoxious shade, more of a warmer color. From the chopsticks to the seats, to the service, this place really takes the time to focus on their customers. Our server tonight was Sheila. She was definitely on point. Super personable, super accommodating and very efficient. By the time we were finished with our meals, I felt like I was hanging out with a friend. I really enjoyed her as a server! This place truly takes pride in their service as well as their food. Here's what we had tonight and here's what I thought:  Yellowtail Yuzu Soy for $12: Sheila said this was their signature dish so we just had to try it! Sliced Yellowtail sashimi topped with tempura serrano peppers, garlic dust and micro cilantro over a bed of Ponzu sauce and garlic oil. WHAT AN AMAZING DISH! The sashimi was super fresh, the serrano, dust and cilantro brought a  clean crisp taste and texture to the raw fish and the oil and sauce enhanced the overall flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!  Mixed Sashimi (15 pc.) Special for $25: One of my friends tonight recommended this  dish to share. I'm so glad she did! This huge dish came with various cuts of sashimi: Tuna, salmon, 2 kinds of snapper, yellowtail and scallops. Each cut was super fresh and not accompanied with a super fishy smell. The garnish made the plate super easy on the eye, but the food solidified it's beauty. Definitely a must try!  Tuna Box Sushi for $12: This was a cool roll! Tuna, Spicy Mayo, avocado, shrimp and rice crackers all formed into a box shape. The flavor was insane! First, I'm going to keep reiterating the fact that the proteins are so fresh! What I really liked was the crunch from the rice cracker balls. The crunchiness really brought a nice texture to the overall roll.  You have got to try this one!  Spicy Salmon roll for $6: So good, we ordered 6 of them! Spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber in a roll. What stood out was that there was a lot of salmon in this roll! Definitely worth the price and the salmon had a really good flavor to it. I loved it!  Man, I'm so glad I was able to try this place. It's become such a huge favorite spot within the Yelp community and I can definitely see why! Our party was really treated with the most respect and I truly appreciated it. Reviewing a place involves your opinion in multiple areas including, but certainly not limited to, the atmosphere, the service and the food. In other words, the entire experience and let me tell you, Soho has exceeded my experience expectations. Thanks so much, Sheila and the rest of the gang at Soho!",

    "text": "So excited to find this place. The positive reviews are spot on; thank you Yelpers.  Top quality, fresh fish with sashimi platters to rival the best. Looking for the classic Nobu style dishes (like yellowtail  jalapeno, miso cod, etc.) for literally less than half the price as well as dishes with a unique twist. The trout sashimi with all sorts of goodness including a sprinkling of poprocks was fantastic.  The Chef-Owner made the rounds chatting with folks. When he came to our table he spoke with such passion it's no wonder the food is so amazing. We even learned something new from him. He shared that mackerel (Saba) mate in the summer, so by nature their fat and nutrients are stored and used for biological purposes. Which by default makes them  less flavorful. He indicated he will be bringing in Japanese Saba come fall when mating season is over. Who knew?  Decor wise expect your typical trip mall restaurant, but the friendly, attentive staff and amazing food make this spot worth visiting on a regular basis. We will be back; likely once a week.  We ate and drank like kings (including alcohol) for ~$70 for two people.",

The mango sake is good- my fiance said it's not very strong in his opinion but I'm ok with that. The shrimp tempura roll was my favorite (I'm basic). The server let us switch to a more comfortable table. The only thing this place could improve on is the bathrooms. They were dark and in need of some updates but not a big deal. We'll definitely be back!",

The seared albacore sashimi is one of my faves and the yellowtail kama, one of the best I've tried; very crispy on the outside and soft inside, super tasty!! I also liked the fried Calamari. Service is great as well! Drinks are also a fantastic deal on happy hour, I liked their lyche sake. The only con I can think is that rolls are so small that I barely tasted the fish in one of them, but still very good flavor.",

    "text": "Eleventy bajillion stars, but Yelp only allows me to give a mere 5. To put this review in perspective, I was at Nobu (the flagship) last week. I spent an obscene amount of money there and had a fabulous meal. Soho is better - period.   First - you will be welcomed genuinely. I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef chatted me up through the meal, as did the peeps next to me. This is a locals place in the best way.   Second - value. From 5-7 M-F they have a great happy hour. Beer, sake, apps, some Sashimi plates are just $5. The regular prices are a BARGAIN people - I live in MKE and let me tell you, it's not a high roller sushi town (big surprise right?) but I would expect to pay at least 50% more. On the Strip? For this quality, you should pay triple! The sushi chef said they get people bitching about their prices and I have to be honest - what????? This is some top quality shit (aka Nobu) and amazing preparations.  Third - sashimi. Yes, please - all day. The chef specializes in it, and the cold sashimi dishes are where it's at. Started with Cajun albacore ($5 HH) which was wonderfully peppery, then salmon wasabi ($11) - a ton of lovely fish. After that - yellowtail (comp'd) - fucking amazing, then ocean cod w/pop rocks ($12) - must have, so creative! Finally - escolar carpaccio ($5 hh), and raw fish Italian style followed by one bite tuna tartare with gold leaf. Does that sound like a lot of raw fish? Too bad!! Don't judge me - I've been dreaming about a return to Soho for 2 years. Let me have my moment. My bill? For all this perfect fish + 2 sakes???? $46 - what?????????? I can't even - that is crazy.   How this place doesn't have a line out the door and around the block, I don't know. I do know that many of the local chefs from the Strip get their sushi on here and you should too!",

When we first arrived, about 6:30 PM on a Thursday, which was 30 minutes before happy hour was up, the hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait to get seated. Determined to get the happy hour menu, we waited and were actually seated a couple minutes before 7. It seems they are quick to turn their tables over, even during a rush.  We ordered about 20 items from the happy hour menu, all of which are $5 each and came in good portions. Some favorites of mine were the salmon avocado roll, brusselsprouts, salmon and Cajun albacore carpaccio, and the spicy tuna dip. Everything was delicious and came out at a good pace. The waiters were attentive, always topping off our waters, and the chef even stopped by at the end of our meal to ask about our experience! Overall, we were definitely satisfied, and we will be back again for happy hour and to try out their lunch menu!",

The restaurant is very nicely decorated, loved the lighting and service was exceptional.   Our waiter was super friendly and informative and our food came out so quickly. The menu consisted more of rolls and fusion Japanese food dishes. Just don't expect home style Japanese food here but for what it is, they did a good job. The fish was super fresh and presentation of the food was beautiful. My cousin and his friend ordered a couple of their sushi rolls and they were huge! It's always nice to get bigger portions than you expect at a sushi restaurant. Good Job Soho! This customer was a happy customer.",

Little did I know how accommodating they would be for us! Unbelievable service and so sensitive to our dietary needs. They made every item (even tempura) in a gluten free option for us and where so knowledgeable. Our waiter, Charles, was sooo kind! He gave the best recommendations. I swear- you won't regret eating here. Hands down the best sushi I've had in a long time- and I'm from San Francisco and total foodie!! I don't recommended places lightly!!

We ordered 4 different tadas, the hamachi sashimi, the ahi roll on crispy rice, the shrimp tempura roll, the hamachi kama, and the beef tataki. The beef tataki was our favorite dish. Everything was so fresh.  The service was impeccable and the chef/owner came out to talk with us. Highly recommend!",

One of the waitresses came over to talk to us while we were waiting to be seated and recommended several items on the menu.  The main chef came out after our meal was over to ask how we liked our food.  They even gave us souvenir sushi-style keychain charms on the way out, which was cute and a sweet gesture.

Let me just tell you, this place blew our minds!!! We got there during happy hour on a Monday. I highly recommend going during happy hour because the prices on the menu are insane!   There's so many different items on the menu. From sushi, to sliders, and so many different rolls. We ordered: bang bang shrimp, yellowtail sashimi in yuzu soy, mixed seafood tostadas, angus sliders, the diablo roll, and a few items off of the nigiri sushi list. Not a single thing was disappointing. The quality of the fish was so good, especially for that price. The bang bang shrimp was super creamy and crispy. The sliders literally blew our minds. The angus beef was super juicy paired with the Hawaiian sweet roll and cheese...ugh... It was just all so so good.   We were really impressed. I'm terrible at leaving reviews but this place was one I knew I needed to post about.   HIGHLY recommend this place!",

    "text": "I'm really torn that I can't give this place 5 stars because it was almost a perfect experience. Four of us came in here without a reservation around 7pm on a Friday. We were quoted a 20min wait, which was reasonable. I think we were actually seated a little earlier, which was great.   First off, service was very friendly - our waitress made her rounds every few minutes to check on us and she was very patient while we were trying to check out the menu.  We started off ordering a couple appetizers - one of them was the escolar carpaccio. While the olive oil / vinegar sauce was great, the fish itself was sliced so paper thin that I could barely taste what I was eating.  Oysters - we ordered a couple of the Shigoku and the Kumamoto oysters - they were very fresh and clean tasting but a little steep at $3/$4 each plus another $3 each for added uni and ikura.   Seared tuna appetizer - presentation was beautiful, the sliced truffle and garnishes were a nice touch, however the roasted pieces of garlic that were placed on top gave it a bitter element that was not too kind to the palette.   Chicken wings - Garlic Parmesan - this was a big miss for me - the sauce was super thick with almost a mayonnaise type consistency and the breading was super heavy as well. I would not recommend these at all.   Salmon Kama - reasonably priced at $6 - however I was not a fan of the glaze - it almost tasted like a dessert. If I were to order this again, I would ask for no sauces on it, just plain.   The sushi and sashimi that we ordered was very fresh. The sashimi actually came on a beautifully decorated plate and is a pretty good value at $45.  The total for 2 of us with drink and tip came out to about $150. My honest opinion about this place is that for non-happy hour - it's a little pricey - but the plates are beautiful! A couple of the items just didn't do it for me - maybe it was a little too \"fusion\" for my taste. If I were to do it again, I'd come for the happy hour specials.",

    "text": "Soho is by far my favorite happy hour in Las Vegas.  How many happy hours go on from 12-7pm?! It used to be 4-7, but the menu I got this last time said otherwise.   I will say once it starts hitting around 5:30-7pm expect a wait if you have a bigger group. Word has spread that they are the place be.  All their food items on the happy hour menu are 5 dollars,  and it's a fairly long list of options.   I feel the biggest steals on the happy hour are their sashimi.   They are not throwing you low level cuts of fish.  It's super fresh,  and they have some amazing sauces full of flavor.   My top 3 items I like to order are..  Salmon yuzu soy sauce... Melts in your mouth and has a sliced and then fried jalapeno on top of each piece .  Beef tataki in soy,  sesame oil,  and garlic.    Cajun albacore sashimi in a creamy ponzu sauce with microgreens and thin red onions and slivered pepper.   Other than those items that I order every time that still deserve honorable mention...  Tostadas with avacado crema and poke  Seafood dynamite roll (the taste is more complex than the description, also filling)   Bang bang shrimp, somehow still crispy despite spicy aioli it's immersed in.  The flavor really explodes in your mouth.  Aptly named   Crispy Brussel sprouts... I don't know how or why but they are addictive   Pork belly kushiyaki,  so fatty but not to chewy,  and very satisfying  Items I am not a fan of,   salmon carpaccio , marscapone cream ways dish down  Salmon avacado creme,  just didnt bring out the flavor of fish in its best light  Escolar carpaccio , Italian and Japanese clashed instead if married in the dish  Now aside from the food the service here has always been wonderful.  I have had people bring complimetary sake for my mom's birthday,  give us small plates on the house especially when I bring someone who has not been,  or if they just want us to experience something we have not ordered before they feel we will like .   I feel like they personalize your experience,  and empower their staff to do so.  That's a big deal,  when people are properly lead and managed it shines in how they treat their guests.",

From 3 pm to 7 pm monday to saturday (closed sundays) your taste buds and your stomach can care less about a silly mouse with some imagination. Here the only thing that has to do with imagination are for the people that haven't been here yet not knowing how good it is. They can only imagine what they are missing out. And, it doesnt cost an arm an a leg to eat here. Just 5 bucks for any entree on the Happy Hour list.  Been here at least 4 times and im pretty sure that I have tried just about everything on the happy hour menu. Eventually I will try some of their stuff from the regular menu but their happy hour menu is so hard to beat. If you refer to my pics you cant go wrong with any selection, unless you are allergic or something.  Service is outstanding! From all the times we have been here, all the employees are very friendly and seem to love their job. Whatever we order they always bring it out in a timely manner. Everything is always made from scratch.  I highly recommend making reservations especially if you have a party of 4 or more for happy hour is when it gets really busy. If you are going solo or if there are only 2 of you than you have good chance of either getting a table right away or if there are spots open at the sushi bar thats not a bad place to sit. The sushi bar is where you can see all the action take place.  In closing, I would not hesitate passing this place up any time im nearby especially when the time is 3 to 7 pm monday through friday. They even have LCD tvs for you sports junkies. If its a big game, more than likely they will be showing it.   Yelp 2018 Review #72 741 overall",

Nice spacious interior, cheap sake ;) Will totally be back next time i'm town. My fav tonight was the happy hour sushi roll that had scallop and crab inside, also the albacore and pork belly ... all the raw fish was very good. The only thing that wasn't a personal fav of mine was the garlic Parmesan wings . A bit too creamy for me but everything else was amazing !",

After coming here, I get what all the fuss is about. Two words, happy hour. Their happy hour menu goes from noon-7, so basically it's happy hour all day long. All of the items on their happy hour menu is $5. So we went to town with trying different items. They were good portions given the discount. All of the items we ordered were excellent. I also really liked our server, who was very attentive and offered his favorite items on the menu. Overall this place delivered on all levels. I will definitely come back again.",

The uni portion is a good amount and great quality. Taste like butter.  -Spicy crab roll with the snow crab for the win. Not the imitation crab meat.   Lava cake was very sad. It looked like it came out of a box and ice added on top. The chocolate does not ooze out. Nothing more, nothing less.  Would come back, great price with quality food.",

Our waters were refilled as soon as our cups are halfway empty. It does get busy towards the late afternoon but our server made sure we were taken care of.

    "text": "Arrived right at opening time, noon, with a couple other couples. Was greeted warmly and sat quickly. The lunch menu is pretty sparse, BUT, there are quite a few diverse options on their $5 \"Happy Hour\" menu, which runs amazingly from noon till 7pm. Five dollars for fish and chips!? My wife and I selected from the Prix Fixe menu, $9.95(daaang!) which comes with a main entree, a soup, a salad, and a rice serving. There are two choices for rice, two for the soup, two for the salad, and 4 or 5 for the main entree. I went with the Fried Chicken Katsu and my wifey got the Salmon one. We also ordered a Spicy Salmon Sushi roll off the $5 menu and a tea each.  The soup comes first. I had the mushroom and my wife had the traditional miso. Mine was very rich and flavorful and very good. Then came the salad. We both went with the seaweed salads. Dang this was yummy! Soy'y, peanutty, fresh and delightful. Super good. Then came the main entree. I got two servings of what looked like fresh pounded out fried chicken, cut up nicely into yummy crunchie yum strips. My wife had two generous portions of pink salmon. There are some cabbage strips and some bean things on the plate as well I suppose to mix all in. The katsu sauce was served in a tiny cup on the side. Mine was SUPER GOOD. I loved the flavorful katsu sauce. It all mixed together well. My wife was super satisfied with her salmon, and did not finish. So a good amount. The teas were $3 a piece and were refilled two times. Ambiance was terrific and perfect for lunch. Not too bright, not too anything. Just perfect.  The reason for the four star instead of five, was the, I would say \"odd\" service. We were sat by one woman, drink order taken by another woman, waited around for her to return, then another woman appeared and took our food order, then waited around. Then wondered where the Spicy Salmon Sushi was. Then waited a bit more. Then other folks who arrived after us were by this time starting to leave. Then our food came by yet another person. Usually the more waitstaff the better. I don't know if maybe there was just some miscommunication or what, but it was an off day that tainted my first impression. Then there was some more waiting for the check and the table to be cleared. When the check came, we brought up the Spicy Salmon roll, and the guy was somewhat disingenuous with his apology. Then the woman who took our order came by to offer an sincere apology about it. It ended up being a wash as the food was plenty filling as it was, however the odd service today left a negative impression for me.  I would be willing to come back, as the food was delicious, the ambiance terrific, and the prices were excellent! Maybe today was just \"off.\" ",

The menu is a bit different and the portions are a little smaller but the whole quality and commitment to excellence is still there.  The owner is splitting his time between the full service and their newer fast food restaurant platform.  But still people waiting to get in at 5pm so all good!! We had several things twice! We loved their scallop hand rolls. So much that we had two orders (each!) and 4 orders of Uni.  Delicious!!!! We also had the VERY BEST Salmon collar I think we have ever had I any restaurant.  It was cooked perfectly and so light. So well worth a try!! Yummy",

We ordered the following from the HH menu: -Bacon wrapped Kurobuta Sausages ($5) -Hydro Bibb Black Cod ($4) -Salmon Avocado Roll ($4) -Ika Geso (fried squid) ($4) -Jalapeno poppers ($5)  We enjoyed everything but my favorite was the Ika Geso (fried squid)!  It was warm and crispy when it arrived and the aioli dip was a great compliment to the dish. What an amazing price too!  Another dish we enjoyed very much was the yellowtail sashimi drizzled with yuzu soy.  The fish was fresh and the sauce was refreshing. It was $12 for 6 pieces - a great value!  Since we saved so much on the other items, we decided to splurge on the Hokkaido uni sushi ($16 for two pieces).  It was delicious!  The uni was creamy and very fresh!  Reservations are highly recommended!  They have flat screen tvs and they were showing football when we were there.   The service is 5 STARS!!  Plenty of parking in the shared lot.",

The fish was fresh with amazing texture and flavor. So happy to not find fish swimming in mayo. We can't wait to go back and eat whatever they recommend. Thank you Soho for a most satisfying meal!",

    "text": "All the 5 star reviews was what got my boyfriend and I to troop all the way here.  Service: 0/5 Food: 1.5/5 Organization: -10/10  There is no flow here. Workers are too busy dancing/playing or on their phones.  When we came in, we waited for a table. At least 7 tables were open, all 4 high tops were open. We were told to wait. Eventually girl 1 came to us and told us only tables available were the high tops and bar seats. We said the high tops were fine, they told us to seat ourselves. We sat ourselves and a different girl (girl 2) gave us our menus and walked away. After waiting a bit, guy 1 gave us water and walked away. We looked at the menu and waited for the server/guy 1 to come back. Waited a while but Guy 1 was busy bussing tables. We waited about 10 minutes. I was staring at the back but everyone was huddled up talking and joking around. Then Guy 1 went to the back. Eventually Guy 2 got the hint and came up to us and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered everything in one go. Sodas came. Food took awhile to come out as in it came out one by one. We tried to get our servers attention. Eventually girl 2 asked if i needed a refill... told her yes and my boyfriend needed a refill too. Waited for her to come back for 5 minutes but saw her come back to the front and just stand there. Eventually girl 3 came with my drink but my boyfriend's drink was forgotten. We were ready to leave by now.   No one has a specific role here. It seems like they believe it is teamwork but there is a lack of  organization and consideration. Everything and everyone was all over the place. The food was nothing amazing or memorable.   In my opinion, they need to figure out how to organize and work everything out. Everyone should have a specific role or everyone should learn how to balance everything. I worked as a hostess for almost 2 years. I understand there are difficulties and issues might come up but this was just terrible.",

We arrived a few mins after happy hour ended and our server told us the unfortunate news. Luckily the girl next to her saw me take out my yelp app and came right over to ask, is it your first time? We'll extend it for you...:) Woo hoo! We were thrilled because we wanted to try happy hour out first!   Started with the tuna tostada, amazing! Sweet and fresh and the perfect way to start our meal! Also a very delicate & modern presentation.   Next came the stuffed mushrooms, not a fan at all. The flavors were ok but the breading was dense and the bites were heavy. I didn't enjoy it.  Next came the Cajun albacore sashimi. My favorite dish of the evening. So fresh and delicate and very mild in flavor. Like butter...  Next the cod, my second favorite item. It was cooked perfectly, sweet & tender.   Next the firecracker roll. Great combinations of flavors with sweet onions on top and over all a very well balanced roll. Crunchy, creamy, sweet & spicy.  Next the Ika Geso, octopus! It was tossed an a very addicting curry powder!   And lastly a spicy tuna roll, filled with tuna! And a shrimp tempura roll. Both were great!  All this delicious food was only $40 for happy hour! An incredible value and over all a very good time!   Hope someone comes in with some decorating skills or I'll do it on trade :)  Can't wait to go back & try the regular menu!",

I was nervous that our hour and a half we allocated for lunch would not be snuff to enjoy our meal. I have never been here for lunch before, I order the soho moco and to my surprise it was served in less that 15 min as well as all the other plates on out table. We ate and the tables was cleared almost instantly. The amazing part was we where never rushed out we had our meeting and no one offered us the check it made me feel as if was ok to stay.   The food was incredible the service God sent.  The ceilings are red and they help to remind you that your not in a culinary dream as you find your self looking up to thank god for the great flavors your experiencing.   Chef John offers the food experience of the strip in a constable eating environment that allows you to be dressed up or casual at less than half the cost of the strip.   I have now tried 3 deserts and can pick one, my intent is to try them all.  This will be my default lunch spot.",

Servers are always attentive and fun! The restaurant is very clean and modern/upscale. I always want to dress up to eat here because it's so pretty in here!

I have been to their happy hour on 5 occasions and even ordered everything on the Happy hour menu one time.       The Calamari, Salmon Roll, Albacore Sashimi, Black Cob Lettuce Wraps and Tadas  were the highlights from the Happy Hour menu.  The Maki, stuffed mushrooms and stuffed Jalapenos were not very good and we never ordered them again.   We have ordered several of the sushi rolls on numerous occasions and really have enjoyed them.  I do like that they use fresh fish and quality ingredients in their sushi.    We had their Miso Black Cod, numerous sushi rolls and the Angus Bone is Rib for a dinner party.  The Miso Black Cod was truly the highlight of the night.  Everyone loved it along with the sushi.      I do love their Happy Hour!  They have lots of great items to choose from.  They don't skimp on the size of the dishes just because it is happy hour which is even better. Great place and just around the block from my house!",

I was skeptical of this place, but we were blown away by how yummy and affordable it was!  A lot of the dishes are very similar to Nobu, but at this price point I was thrilled to see them ! $2 for sashimi tacos that go for $15+ at Nobu? Yes please! I adore Ocean trout and was pleased to see this as a sashimi offering (with pop rocks, which were really fun). I also loved the black cod lettuce wraps for only $8 (wow).   The only slight let down was the twin dragon roll - it was large and lacked the refinement the rest of the food we ate had (the crunchy tuna roll on the other hand was a pleasant surprise!).   Service was friendly and gave us a free sashimi platter to welcome us to the restaurant. I'll be back every time I come to Vegas !",

It's rare that you see a 5 star rating  on yelp with a LOT of reviews, so we had to try this place and I'm proud to say they deserve it. The food is fabulous. What I love is that everything had it's own distinctive flavor. So often you go to a sushi place and they use the same sauce on everything. We went during happy hour and ordered just about everything on the happy hour menu. Needless to say we couldn't finish everything but we came close and it was under $50 for both of us. The service was the best I've ever experienced in any asian restaurant, you know how bad it can get. I will definitely go back next time i'm in vegas.",

Everything we had was amazing. The Yellowtail Yuzu Soy was outstanding. The nigiri and sashimi were so fresh they melted in the mouth. We split several rolls, all of which were absolutely fantastic.  Second, the service. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Our server gave great recommendations and was just so pleasant! And very attentive to our glasses of water as we plowed through several pints after a day walking in the Las Vegas summer heat!  All in all I wish I lived closer so that I could go back to SoHo! I'll definitely be returning the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I love this place and the owner John is great the staff is friendly and the food is good!! It is on the pricier side if you like to try lots of things and well.... we usually do but soooooo worth it!!

We couldn't decide which was our favorite since all 6 tasted phenomenal. We also ordered the Cajun albacore cold plate, soft shell crab appetizer and twin dragon roll...all were AWESOME!  Our server recommended the green tea tiramisu and it did not disappoint. You definitely need to save stomach room for this.   I don't think we can go back to the other sushi place. The quality of the fish was far better and the service was 10 times better...I know it's not really comparable since the other place is a high churn AYCE restaurant but since they are equidistant from our house, we will definitely keep coming to Soho from now on.",

The lunch here is great for the price ($8 i think) but it's no where near as good as the dinner items. I've gone here during lunch time and just ordered off the dinner menu since it's so much better.

Nothing we tried disappointed us in any way, and our only regret was that we live in Montana and can't come here more often!! The staff was very attentive, and knew the menu so they could explain to us any ingredients we weren't familiar with. We were honored to meet Chef John, and his passion for the products he presents his patrons with is very obvious.   We visited Soho's twice while we were in town, and I think we went through the whole list of sashimi specialties. The husband doesn't like salmon, but the Wasabi Cream Salmon won him over. Next trip I really have to try the oysters and the miso cod, among other things.   There is truly a reason Soho has a 5-star Yelp rating, and you will not be disappointed with a visit here!",

It was so good that we ordered multiple servings. The waitress Sheila recommend great dishes and we devoured them. We saw that they served uni and we asked to order one to try it. We were torn between the Catalina uni and the Japanese uni. We were told that they had different flavor notes. We ended up with the Catalina uni and they even threw in the Japanese uni on the house for us to try. Amazing! The chef also walked us out sea trout sashimi on the house for us since we were celebrating a birthday. And even threw in peach sake. My experience here was unforgettable! I will be recommending this place to everyone and will be looking forward to coming back. Oh and they use real Alaskan crab in their sushi. Not that imitation crap....best sushi I've ever had.

They have shrimp tadas that are not on the HH menu which is $2. You have to try their Hydro Bib. Delicious! Its like miniature fish/lettuce wrap. Everything on the menu was very good! The customer service was quick and attentive. Its a really nice quaint restaurant with great HH prices.",

    "text": "Welcome to Vegas Friday Lunch Nov 7  My wife and I came here after long drive from Chino based on the reviews. I wanted to eat a light meal since we had dinner plans that day. The waitress helped us with our selections we asked which was their most popular menu items. She pointed us to their Twin Dragon Roll $15 and their Tadas $2 ea. Tuna, Yellowtail, Shrimp or Salmon. We ordered the tuna, and yellow tail tadas 2 each and also shared the Twin Dragon Roll $15.   The tadas- wonton chips topped with an avocado sauce under the Fresh Tuna or Fresh Yellow tail, were very good the tuna and spices were very refreshing while the yellowtail had a good tangy tasty flavor. They were so good I had to order more. The Twin Dragon roll was OK- Alaskan King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and tempura shrimp. Dont take my word for it though, im not a big fan of tempura shrimp on top of rolls, just too bready for me. I will be back for more Tadas though and to sample other items on the menu as we were having a light lunch.  I also ordered a beer waitress asked if I wanted another I declined to my surprise she mistakenly brought it out. I informed her, she said no worries my mistake on the house. Very nice attentive. She also let us know the tadas are only $1 during happy hour, Ill be back next time and fill my table with tadas.   Prices were great, Service was great, Quality Superb- overall great dining experience look forward to coming back next time in Vegas.",

    "text": "THE COOLEST AND NOW MY FAVORITE PLACE TO BE!!!!  Being the outspoken and outgoing person that I am, I'm already glad that our server had a great sense of humor and definitely played along with my outspokenness. He was so accommodating and was more than happy to let us order off of the happy hour menu even a little after it was over.   Now, the small trick to knowing if their service is \"on point\" is if they refill your water when it is empty without having to call for me to refill it. They most certainly refilled my water every time I took a sip out of glass of water, and refilled my glass every time I took my shot of lychee sake. Not only that, the Chef even came out to introduce himself, and offer a couple of complementary chef plates. It was DIVINE! I love their service here, and I can definitely see why they merit 5 stars.  Here are my faves: HYDRO BIB BLACK COD - served in a leaf of lettuce (like a lettuce wrap). That nice butter texture with a slight smoke to it. So good I could even do without the lettuce.  STUFFED MUSHROOM - as any stuffed mushroom is. DIVINE!   **FISH TOSTADAS - truly one of a kind and really the reason to come eat here. You'd want to buy 2 of each tostada during Happy Hour FOR SURE. It's fresh, and their tostada tastes like sweet panko crackers. Yum!  **UNI FROM THREE SEAS (thank you chef!) - AMAZING. Thank God this Uni was what I experienced my first Uni moment with. It comes from three seas. Santa Barbara, Catalina, and (if I am correct) Hokkaido, Japan. You start from SB and work your way towards Hokkaido (yes a journey right in front of your eyes). For a first time UNI-eater, I truly love the sweet taste to it.  After 1 soho maki, 8 fish tostadas, 1 fire cracker roll, 1 stuffed mushroom, 2 hyrdos, a sake and a creme brulee, my tab came out to around $50 for 2 people during happy hour. I'm pleased.  I love you servers and I love you Chef. You've got yourself a new fan!",

    "text": "This is only the second five star review I have given since I started Yelp. Not being a huge fan of raw fish I was hesitant to come here because I know this is where the restaurant shines. But I came with an open mind and ordered a dish from every section of the menu.  I tried the yellowtail sashimi; shrimp tostada; hydro bibb black cod; rock shrimp tempura; cucumber salad; albacore; fire cracker roll; soft shell crab roll. The standouts for me were the yellowtail sashimi, shrimp tostada, shrimp tempura, and the fire cracker roll. A lot of the time I am not a fan of sushi because of all the soft elements but both the shrimp tempura roll and the fire cracker roll had a variety of textures. The shrimp tempura was lightly fried with the right amount of breading. Might have been the best shrimp tempura I have ever had. The yellowtail sashimi was also very good with the jalapeno tempura on top giving it the crunchy element I look for in dishes with raw fish. The two dishes I was not a big fan of were the hydro bib black cod and the cucumber salad. The black cod tasted fine but it was missing something and the piece given was extremely tiny so the lettuce took over. Cucumber salad had no flavor so I added a little extra soy sauce. Nothing I put in my mouth was bad but a few dishes needed a little refinement.   Best Japanese I have had in Las Vegas and prices are ridiculously affordable for the quality of fish and ingredients being used.   The chef/ owner is also nice and humble so I will be back time and time again.",

Superb service, great chef/ owner. Great Happy Hour. But most of all great food. To have a great restaurant, you have a great food. And this restaurant is a True epitome of a restaurant that knows what they are doing. Me and my wife try all their happy hour menu and absolutely adore their miso black cod.  Nobu have one of the best Miso black cod in the city but for the price they are asking, I rather hit SOHO. I shall see you again soon SOHO!!!",

And I rarely give 5 stars because I think you can always improve. But the service here is super attentive, yet not invasive! I have enjoyed every meal I've had here! And appreciated the service each and every time!!!! Our server this time in, had a tattoo of diamond head on her arm, so I assumed she had Hawaii ties. She was fantastic! We enjoyed every minute. And although they did not have any more of the braised short ribs that I wanted so badly, my meal was nonetheless delicious! I had the miso sea bass. Yummy and huge portion (in comparison to the butterfish they used to serve). My wife, son, and daughter had the hamachi. My kids also had  the smaller deluxe sushi assortment, which was huge and FANCY! I have to say it was my best meal this trip! Oh wait, it is usually always my best meal!!! We also hit the last few minutes of happy hour so we got brussels sprouts, spicy ahi roll and avocado roll! And a few bottles of yummy Sake, peach and lychee! So ono!!!!!!!! Thank you Soho, for never failing to please!",

The waiters and waitresses were on point throughout the night. No complaints here.  Now onto the good stuff. The food!  We happened to get here early before Happy Hour ended, so we figured why not check that out as well.  The happy hour here is amazing! $5 entrees on really good items. You definitely can't go wrong with that!  From the Happy Hour list we ordered:  Baked Mussels - So good   Truffle Broccoli - Fire  Tempura beans - really good!  Escolar Carpaccio - Sooo good!  Yellowtail tadas - Good  Salmon tadas - Fire  Tuna Tadas - so good  Seared Albacore - Amazing   Off the regular Menu:  Grilled Octopus - So good!  Rock Shrimp - Love the sauces  Short Ribs - Bomb  Scallops - Amazing  Sushi Rolls:  Volcano (Fried, no cream cheese, no jalepaneo) - Fire  Flying Fish - Bomb  Nutter pillar Roll - bomb  Twin dragons - ok  High roller - ok  Definitely go here! So good!   Only critic - They should add a couple more specialty Sushi Rolls. They do such a great job with sauces and flavors - they have the potential to make even more unique rolls.",

This place is awesome.   Came here for my birthday at 5pm on a Saturday. We were sat right away, there were a bunch of pre- reserved tables, so it was kind of empty. I'd recommend to make reservations at the bar. The hostess was friendly and fast. She quickly acknowledge everyone who came in. Our server, Gabriel was on it. He was quick to service us, on top of it, and even brought me treats for my birthday. He even had a shot with us. Happy our is bomb here. We tried J-pop cider, Sapporo tap, lychee sake, mango sake and some other yummy drinks I can't remember. Lol.  The happy hour food was amazing! It wasn't the typical roll sushi, it was quality appetizers and rolls. We enjoyed the brusselsprouts, spicy tuna dip, tostada dip, spider roll.   For my birthday they surprised me with 3 Mochi ice cream flavors and yummy green tea cheese cake.  I highly recommend this place when you are in Vegas, very convenient if you are in South West area of Vegas. .  Thank you SoHo for making my birthday wonderful!!",

Happy hour from 5-7 is awesome with many items for 5 bucks. My favs are the salmon avocado roll and the shrimp tempura roll. We get the roasted Brussel sprouts every time too. They only make so many sprouts so get them early!  We love the golden ocean trout, with pop rocks, it's a go to these days. Never had anything that wasn't fresh and delicious.    Service is always great. We always ask for Sheila and she is the best. The food comes quick and they are even quicker to clear the plates. The drinks never get empty and water is always full.   The chefs are friendly, often visiting the table to check on our experience. We are regulars and the chefs will often send over a little treat. It's always appreciated and never expected. It's the little touches like that that have made this our favorite sushi spot.  Great place!",

Absolutely melted in our mouths.  Also tried the salmon avocado creme, completely delicious.  I had mango sake and it hit the spot.  Everything we tried was just perfect.  I could've lived without the kobe burgers but that was my fault for ordering a burger in a sushi joint.  Edamame was spot on too.  And the price tag was under a 100 bucks for a ton of food.  Go to Soho, you won't be disappointed!",

This wasn't our first trip to Vegas so we wanted more of an \"off the Strip\" experience this time around, especially for dining and entertainment.    I found Soho House using yelp and google and I am so happy we decided to give them a try. The attention to detail, freshness of the fish, and amazing customer service, made this our best dining experience ever.  I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world, on nearly every continent, but have never had the combination of amazing food and service like I did at Soho house. Imagine my surprise when I found out that Nobu and Soho house have the same seafood purveyor! I'm really kicking myself for spending $$$$ at Nobu last year when we could have gone to Soho House instead.  Well, you don't know what you don't know.  Now, on to what I do know.  Sushi Chef Tai is brilliant!  Every dish we tried was so perfectly balanced. The only word I can think of to describe the flavors is: BRIGHT.  No one ingredient overpowered the next, but they all complemented each other so well.  I also appreciate his attention to texture.  I realized immediately after taking my first bite that the boring, overly soft rolls back at home are not going to cut it anymore.  The food alone is a good enough reason to visit Soho House but the level of service we received nearly left me in tears.  Gabriel went out of his way to make sure my husband had an amazing birthday dinner.  It was because of him that we decided to return two days later for a second meal. We had the pleasure of being helped by Sheila, who is the head server.  She is so sweet, warm and smart. She really upped the ante with her superior customer service and left an indelible impression on our hearts.  Thank you to everyone at Soho House for giving us one of the most memorable anniversary weekends ever!",

    "text": "We were craving for good sushi and a friend who lives in Vegas recommended this.  Ambience- very nice, warm colors, soft music (not loud); hostess asked if we had a reservation but since we didn't, she said 'sorry, I don't have any table for you' (and it was half full!) She paused for a second and enjoyed our stunned faces, then smiled saying she was kidding. Hmm, you got us, girl.  Service- Hostess had a good sense of humor.  All the staff, I mean, the waiters/ chef/ sous chef, etc would yell 'Soho something' every few minutes in unison and said 'bye and thank you' to almost every person when they leave. A little over the top maybe? But we enjoyed it.  Food- Twin dragon roll- excellent, large bite sizes. Reeeeeaaaally yummy (might add a little more e's and a's there)  Soft shell crab roll- good but not spectacular. Gobbled it up quickly. Still enjoyed it.  High roller roll- has Wagyu beef in it. Is it just me or did it taste ... hmm, weird? Never tried wagyu beef before. You know when your mind expects sushi taste but your taste buds give you something else? It was good- just wasn't expecting that taste. Wagyu has a little after taste. May have to try it again. I always give food a second chance. (Yeah baby. )  Mochi- can't go wrong with Mochi. It's always good. Liked the chocolate ice cream and the chewy outer layer (don't know how to describe). Trust me, it's good.   Will definitely recommend and come back on our next trip to Vegas.",

At an average price of $5 per item, you can sample the entire happy hour menu! Highly recommend this awesome place!",

The menu was perfect and very reasonable priced. They also had chef specials which was absolutely delicious. The sea bass was perfectly cooked.  Our server did an amazing job!! He took the time to go through the menu and suggested items that he felt was perfect for sharing. He took the time to explain the specials for the day and not once did he make us feel rushed, even after we had our desserts. Since my friends were celebrating birthdays, our server was kind enough to (1) ask if we were celebrating anything special and (2) to bring out something special to help them celebrate which made the dinner extra special. (Look in the pictures). I'm already looking forward to coming back here again and enjoy the delicious food and drinks. Top notch service!! Great job!",

This place was 5 stars until recently. Food quality still great, but service not so much.   The last time I went, it seemed as though they were under staffed, because there were empty tables, but people were still waiting to get seated. We finally got seated, but then it took forever to get our order taken, then of course for our drinks to come. This is was when I looked around to see how many servers there was and I counted 4, and the place wasn't as busy as it normally is so it was annoying to see them chit chatting or just not moving with a sense of urgency.  Another time I've gone the entire was staff was wasted! I didn't mind it at first, I was kind of impressed that it was such a chill establishment letting staff drink, but then our server started to slur her words, and then told us  \"it's just one of those nights you know\". Um, no I don't know... It wouldn't been fine if things weren't forgotten because she didn't put it in.  If it wasn't for the freshness of the ingredients. The service would make me not want to go there anymore, and that is so disappointing considering it is one of my favorite spots.",

It was probably one my favorite deep fried rolls of all time. The bang bang shrimp was really good. It was nicely crisp on the outside and a good amount of spicy. The spicy tuna roll was a solid choice. If you're looking for vegetables, the Brussel sprouts were really good and the broccoli was lightly fried in a tempura batter (very light) and was delicious.   They have a great happy hour with many full sized rolls, appetizers, and sides for $5 each. You can get pretty full for a cheap price. It had a 5 minute wait at 6pm on a Saturday. It can get pretty busy though.",

    "text": "Came here the other day for happy hour. The restaurant itself was decent. Not a very relaxing atmosphere, but we mainly went to just eat so it was fine for that. Eat and go.   They have a great $5 happy hour. It looks like they added quite a few items since previous online pictures. Everything we tried was very good. We had the angus beef sliders (3), Bang Bang shrimp (deep fried), salmon avocado creme (sashimi), deep fried Fire Cracker roll, spicy scallop pico roll, and escolar cilantro (sashimi). We thoroughly enjoyed all the food and cannot wait to try more items.   My only complaint is the restaurant service. The servers were very polite and it's not their fault, but an upper management/owner problem. As a restaurant manager myself, it's very frustrating to see that servers don't have assigned tables/sections. It's more of a free for all with the servers pooling their tips. This isn't an efficient or enjoyable system. We had 3 different servers approach our table to see if we ordered. There is no organization/structure. The problem occurred when we were trying to get our bill and leave. We sat waiting for quite a while until my husband finally had to get up to get someone's attention. Of course, the servers are assuming someone else must have taken care of us or maybe we are waiting for food. This is a horrible way to run a restaurant. Customers will always get ignored when they don't have an assigned server. Very frustrating.   So the 3 stars are mainly for food, but I had to dock 2 because of the lack of organization. We plan on returning because it's a great deal price wise, the food is good, and at least now we know what to expect.",

The place is clean, very casual attire. It wasn't busy when we went, we sat in a second but I could see it being busy.   The reason why I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5 was the quality of the fish could have been better and the rice needs some work too  (the rice was way too dry and tasted old) it was ok to eat but not entirely sure if I'd want to come back.   We made a salmon tempura roll- it was great  Customer salad - eh  Miso soup - good  Truffle tuna sashimi- eh ( if you get it say no cream)  Toro sushi - good  Other sushi- good Soybeans- great   :)",

It feels like you're in a provincial area in Japan inside a family owned restaurant. Actually, I've never been to Japan, so I wouldn't know, but I would like to think it feels and looks like this. Contemporary music playing, not too loud, just right. About 28 people can sit nicely in here. The waiters are nice and always attentive.  Coleslaw Salad: Served in a small bowl, shredded cabbage, shredded carrots with roasted sesame seeds and an asian sweet thousand island like dressing. A nice starter to get your appetite going!  Sapporo Butter Miso: Decent serving of hearty Miso, Corn and Butter flavored Pork soup base. It also comes with ground beef. Egg Noodle with shredded Shiitake mushroom, bean sprouts and Pork Chasu. Delicious! I ordered chili oil on the side. Definitely adds another layer of flavor.  Pork Chasu Bowl: I'm usually scared to try other chasu bowls aside from Sora Ramen, but this place has a nice bowl too! Chasu is mostly meaty on top of Japanese rice. Roasted and non roasted sesame seed sprinkled on top with shredded shallots (i think). The flavor is good, although the chasu pieces were thin. For the price and presentation, I would suggest it, the flavor is great too!  Chicken Karaage: The breading is soft and chicken is moist. The sauce is bold and flavorful! A nice appetizer to get  to wet that appetite.  Black on Black: Now this bowl is what defines this restaurant. That Black garlic and Black squid ink really gives this bowl a bold flavor. Usually Black garlic ramen is watery and has that roasted garlic over powering everything. To each their own, but I like flavors swimming around and having theirselves identifiable. This is what you get here, flavors show themselves and you know what you're eating. The soup is thick and is served in this large black bowl. Presentation is intimidating. I love it! It comes with Chasu and pieces of cut squid. Very Delicious!  Highly recommended!  Price: $34.37 only!!!",

Let me simply break it down for you as to why this is the best happy hour in town...wait for it...their happy hour menu has over 30 items at $5 each! That's right people, 30 plus items!! All just $5 each!! (I realize this review may sound like one of those cheesy car salesman commercials at this point, but I can't help it! I need to get your attention and express how excited I am for a huge variety of $5 happy hour items!!!!)   So what's on this novel list of $5 items you might ask? Well let's just say they have a wide array of options including: bang bang shrimp, full sushi rolls, angus sliders, salmon tostadas, mussels, fish and chips, and even chicken wings!!! We ordered over 12 different items and every single one was incredible!!! It doesn't get much better than that!!  Oh wait, yes it does because I forgot to mention, they have drinks on happy hour too! $3 sangria, $5 sake, and beers ranging from $3-$7. What more could you want?!?  Basically to sum up this review, Soho, your happy hour menu is the absolute best. This Vegas girl loves incredible food, a wide variety of items, and tasty drinks at affordable prices and you delivered just that! I promise, you'll be seeing me in your establishment in the very near future!",

    "text": "We went here for Happy Hour (noon to 7:00 pm) on a Wednesday at 5:00 pm. Happy hour prices are $5 for listed drinks and foods. Great deals.   We started with the lychee sake, sweet and potent. Got the Bang Bang Shrimp. Excellent.  Best \"Bang\" for your buck. Haha.  8 shrimp for $5. Good, too. The Pork Belly Kushiyaki had 2 little skewers of meat. Decent taste but only 2 pieces. Grilled Kalbi Ribs tasted good and had 4 pieces. California Roll 8 pieces of decent sushi roll, great deal.  .   Wife ordered sushi, too. Mirugai was just okay. Taste was not on point. Uni was excellent and on point.   Notice there are 2 excellent dished in this review. Everything else was good. Especially with the $5 pricing. Wife left very happy, me content. I'm a tough sell. Bottom line, we will be back.   Note:  trying Sushi Takashi later this week. I believe the seafood will be fresher and Japanese food tastier for my critical non-sushi palate.",

I've tried all the best sushi restaurants in California, Vegas, NYC, and Japan so I may know a thing or two about sushi :0)   I was a bit skeptical about this place because of ALL the raving reviews. Most Vegas restaurants with such high ratings have been a let down for me, but this one did NOT disappoint. Came here around 1pm and the place was pretty dead. Decided to sit at the sushi bar w/ Chef Aaron (Erin?). Ordered a few appetizers off the HH menu for $5/ea (cajun albacore sashimi, salmon skin salad, escolar cilantro) which were all super good. We ordered the rest off the \"Special Fish\" menu which all ended up so delicious! TBH, the cuts of fish were bigger than what I'm used to, but I know some people prefer this. However, I like the smaller bites as it makes it more enjoyable :) That's my only negative about this place.. other than that, the sushi was SOOOOOO GOOOD and sOOO fresh! My favorites were the Chu-toro, perch, and uni.   This place is not traditional at all... but I love the simple twists they put on each piece. Prefer this place over Sushi Samba, Kabuto, and Hiroyoshi.   Service is impeccable. Def coming back :) So affordable for such good sushi!!!!",

And they used to have a really good white sangria which was my favorite but now, it's gone. Oh well.   Also, make sure to check out their daily specials which is posted just behind the sushi station. We like to order the grilled salmon collar which was very tasty.    Husband likes to order the uni and whatever specials they have. I stick to my usuals like the carpaccio and their not-too-fancy sushis.   Service is pretty quick and almost all the servers are always nice and chatty. Even those guys behind the sushi bar are quite friendly as well.   I would recommend making reservations when in a big group. The place is not that big so depending on how busy they are, one most likely have to wait for a table.",

Everything is extremely fresh and flavorful, and the portion sizes are great.    What made today's lunch extra great was our waiter, Jared. He was super attentive, told us his favorites, and was quick to bring our food and extra water if needed. He had a great attitude, and when we were approaching the end of the meal, he brought us a small portion of the black truffle seared tuna because it's his favorite and he wanted us to try it. It was delicious! Thank you for the awesome service, Jared! We'll be back to see you!",

You'll want to call ahead of time because it's usually a 30 - 60 minute wait. This place stays busy!!!   Erik is one of our favorite sushi chefs. He is great with flavors and we love when he gives us a new dish to try each time we're there. The salmon belly is one of our favorites and he makes it in a variety of ways. All of the staff is wonderful though!   They dont offer an all you can eat option but there is a happy hour from 12  - 7 pm and they have some really yummy items. Off the happy hour menu I definitely recommend trying the Angus sliders, mussels, and salmon creme. Honestly it's all delicious.",

I wanted to check out their $5 Happy Hour menu from 12p-7pm. I finally got to dine here tonight. We had a 5:30pm reservation for 3. It was busy. We had a nice corner table toward the back. Our server was Jarred from Hawai'i. He was very nice, very attentive and gave us great customer service.   We ordered A LOT of food . Don't judge...  We were excited and happy because hey, we were about to throw down on some Soho HH grub. We ordered food and drinks from the Happy Hour menu and food from the regular menu.  The food was literally a party in my mouth.  I even did the \"Happy dance\" in my seat with a shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.   We ordered from the Happy Hour Menu: Everything was excellent, thumbs up, unless a comment was left next to food.  *Crispy Brussel sprouts  *Chicken Karaage -Ok *Cajun Albacore sashimi  *Salmon Uzu soy  *Pork belly Kushiyaki  *Bronze broccoli  *Angus beef tataki   *Mixed Tempura -Ok (veggie was a little crunchy, cook more) *Fish & chips  *Salmon Carpaccio 2x *Soho Tostada -Ok *Shrimp Tempura roll 2x *Salmon Avocado creme 2x  Regular Menu: *Creamy sesame Trout  *Black truffle seared tuna  *Shigoku & Kumamoto Oysters   Special order: *Salmon Kama   Dessert: Matcha Green tea Tiramisu   Happy Hour Drinks: *Infused cold Sake w/ white peach  *Sapporo in draft  nice and cold  *Sangria   Overall: Ambiance was nice. Workers have great customer service. Food is Fantastic. Fish is fresh! I am from Hawai'i  and this is the freshest fish and best sushi I've tasted in Las Vegas. Will I be back? Most definitely.   This IS my new \"Happy Place!\" Shimmy, Shimmy, Shimmy..",

I was able to try a bunch of different things and I am glad I did. The service was great, the waitresses were very attentive to your needs. I had two waitresses named Shila and Alex and they were very nice and great and had great recommendations.  Honestly, everything I tried I really enjoyed, no complaints.  Everything on this menu has interesting ingredients that make the dish worth it and just so delicious.    I started with the baked mussels and crispy brussel sprouts and a sunomono which is a cucumber salad. I also started with the soho tostada mixed seafood.  The brussel sprouts were phenomenal, it had drizzle of parmesan cheese which made the brussel spouts delicious.  I wanted to start with telling you about the ocean trout. It was recommended by one of the waitresses and she didn't tell me the ingredients. It was so delicious and one of the best. I won't tell you what it was, you just have to go, order it, and be surprised.  Some other dishes that I had was angus beef tataki, salmon carpaccio, salmon avocado creme, cajon albacore sashimi, and escolar cilantro.   Overall I had a great experience and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I was really going to give this restaurant 5 stars because I always had a 5 star experience with the $5 happy hour menu. I go to this restaurant very often because I'm a little too obsessed with their salmon yuzu soy. After craving it for a couple of weeks, I finally had a chance to go back. I was so disappointed with how the proportions have gotten smaller. They cut over half of the original proportion for bang bang shrimp - my moms favorite item from this restaurant. The salmon skin salad we ordered was also smaller than it usually is. If I'm paying $5 for a small plate, I expect more than what was given to me. The old proportions kept me satisfied so I'm so sad that I have to knock off one star for this. Taste wise though, this is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the southwest area!! However, it gets pretty crowded sometimes and you can wait for a very long time so for sure check/join the waitlist on yelp before going! Lunchtime usually isn't as crowded. Happy hour goes on everyday until 7pm!  I'm always impressed with the service here. The servers are pretty friendly and are always coming around to make sure my water cup is always filled and clearing empty dishes or asking whether or not I'd like to order more. They're very nice and give good recommendations when asked. That's actually how I discovered the crispy Brussel sprouts!  -HIGHLIGHT FOODS-  SALMON YUZU SOY this is literally my FAVORITE item from soho and I will drive out of my way to come to soho to get this. Plus, it's only $5!! For sashimi!! WHAT A STEAL. The salmon is also fresh and soft and tastes heavenly dipped in the slightly sour ponzu sauce. The best part of this is the little friend jalapeno pepper on top of each salmon slice. I don't have a high spice tolerance, but this wasn't spicy at all! It was just packed with flavor that gave the salmon a nice crunch to it. 100% you should try this item! I always order at least 2 orders of this to myself whenever I eat out with my family.  CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS wow. they did it. they got me to voluntarily order vegetables that have no protein mixed in. And I don't regret it at all! The Brussel sprouts are seared and crispy with a slight parmesan flavor. My mouth is actually watering as I'm writing this review and I may have to go back again soon!  BEEF TATAKI honestly, I don't really know what this is but it tastes AMAZING. It's not exactly raw meat but it's not like cooked maybe seared? My life was changed when I got this. I can't come to soho without ordering this. It has a more tough and chewy consistency compared to the salmon yuzu soy. Definitely a meaty aroma, but it's not heavy. The meat itself is very savory and delicious. The sauce is also like a yuzu ponzu type sauce that compliments the savory meat perfectly. I was so excited for this I forgot to take a picture ! :(   BAKED MUSSELS This comes with 5 large mussels so $1 per mussel! I'm not really a fan of mussels, but this dish is the time it's an exception. The sauce is a more creamy sour ponzu sauce I believe. I forgot to take a picture of this because I just dug right in! If you can't tell by now, ya girl likes ponzu sauce! If you like mussels, this is for you!",

Their happy hour menu is outstanding. I would put it to the top Japanese restaurant in Southern Nevada (without breaking the bank account) Only one problem though it's so crowded especially during happy hour. I usually have dinner here at 4:30PM so there is no or minimum wait time. I haven't successfully reserved the table for the same day between 5 and 6. People arriving after 5:00 PM without reservation would experience an hour wait or so.",

All great! We also ordered the black cod appetizer, which had a rich taste in the fish. The tuna pizza came out next. All parts of the pizza were great; the crust was sweet and the tuna had much taste. The last, but definitely not the least, the short rib. The meat pulled right out of the bone, and the sauce is very rich, which made it filling. This place has amazing food and I recommend this place!",

The Fish is so fresh, thing I typically never eat were actually pretty good.  Happy hr from 4-6 is a must do we ordered about 7 items off of the menu that were filling.  The house White Peach Sake was delicious, Iced green tea was bomb Oh the deserts Green Tea creme brulee and chocolate mouse great stuff.   Soho Maki Bacon Wrapped Kurubota Sausages Stuffed Mushrooms - I don't even like mushrooms and they were delicious Hydro Bib Black Cod Shrimp Tempura Roll Spicy Tuna Roll- My least favorite but still appetizing even for me who doesn't like    spicy tuna Albacore Sashimi Some Complimentary Fish with pop rocks I think sashimi trout - second least fav but still good  The sauces are paired really well with each dish.

The service is 5 star and the restaurant is very clean which is always nice when raw fish is involved. Chef John is very personable with his guests so don't be surprised if he stops by your table to say hello or bring you something to try. The greatest thing about this place for us locals is that it's located off the strip @ 215 & jones so no strip traffic to fight, no walking through casinos and no paying casino prices.

    "text": "When I looked this restaurant up on Yelp, I could not BELIEVE its reviews. At the time it had 5 stars and over 300 reviews. I don't think I've ever seen a rating this good. With my adoration for sushi and impending trip to Vegas, I was dead-set on visiting Soho and thank god I did.  The restaurant was in a strip mall and the decor was fine... it looked like about 30 other sushi restaurants I've been to. I've learned that great things in humble packaging, but I was a bit underwhelmed at first. Silly me! As soon as we sat down, we were treated like absolute royalty. Not only was our waitress very helpful and nice, she was also relaxed and casual with us in a way that my boyfriend and I always really appreciate. We love to crack jokes while interacting with wait staff, and this girl was on top of it, joking right along with us! She was excellent. She then proceeded to give us the BEST recommendations for our meal. Everything we ordered was SO FRESH and just bursting with flavor. No fishy smell or after taste... this fish was fresher than fish I've eaten on both coasts. After we were done, we were so impressed that we ordered another round! I wish that I could recall exactly what we had ordered, but that's kind of irrelevant to my review because literally everything we tried was amazing. I feel like you seriously can't go wrong at this place unless you have a food allergy and purposefully order something that will make you swell up and die. So don't do that.  Dessert was excellent. We had the green tea tiramisu. I feel like if I gush anymore, this review might not sound legitimate, so I'll just leave it at that.  The real clincher was when our check was brought, the waitress brought us out an adorable little sushi keychain and a pen that looked like chopsticks holding a little rubber piece of sushi. I was in love. I wanted to wrap this restaurant up in my arms and fly it back to Colorado with me.  If you're a sushi fan in Vegas, do NOT miss the opportunity to visit this place. Don't let the fact that it's a tiny cab ride away from the strip keep you away, either... the prices and quality of your meal will more than make up for that $20 cab ride.",

How many other factors can possible come together to make this the hardest revue of my Yelp career?  ...and will I ever be able to regain my sanity?  I am told that a great work of art is never truly finished, that the work never ends. After just one visit to Soho Japanese Restaurant, I now understand what that means.  Clearly the great Yelpers of Las Vegas have collectively cried out the praises of this understated little gem in the southwest valley. Not only does it rank top among sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it ranks tops among ALL restaurants in Las Vegas. That little tidbit has to be making some of this town's \"legendary\" chefs red in the face. Someone should tell those people at Michelin they are dinosaurs - no wait, never-mind, let them figure it out.  You see when it comes down to it, it's quite simple - if you do something great, people will notice. And it's clear, Soho does great better than anyone in Vegas.  The first thing you notice when you walk into Soho is that no world renowned restaurant decor consultancy group was brought in to \"class the place up\", like they do in most 5 star restaurants. Soho is a simple, friendly, comfortable and welcoming environment - a 5 star restaurant that won't make you feel like you're not good enough to be there (what a concept.)  The staff are regular people, just like you and me. But management is obviously treating these people with a little respect because it's quite clear they all love working there - it shows in absolutely everything they do. Imagine great service at a 5 star restaurant from friendly people who don't look down their nose at you (are you guys starting to see a trend here?)  But you really don't appreciate how good you have it until the food arrives. It's easy to get so comfortable here that you can forget you are about to partake in one amazing meal. All that changes once you take the first bite. For us it was the Uni Trio - just Wow! (Thank you sir, may I please have another.)  I know what you're thinking, what does a boy who grew up in Fargo, North Dakota know about sushi? Wouldn't he be dead last on the list of people you should trust on the subject? (Hey Buddy, you forgot to cook this!)   Fair enough.  The truth is, you're just going to have to decide for yourself. No amount of banter from me is going to change your mind,so I'll leave that up to the marvelous people at Soho, they are better suited to the task.   Whew! One hundred down, and ready for round two. Go Yelp!",

    "text": "after eating at a bunch of overrated, overpriced places on the strip, soho was our last stop before heading to the airport. BEST DECISION EVER.   soho's salmon wasabi creme is tied for 1st place in my experience as far as the fattiest, most buttery, melt-in-your-mouth salmon sashimi i've ever had. i am not a wasabi fan at all but the flavors balanced and blended beautifully. and extra points for presentation! my friend's fiance said this dish was so good he almost cried haha.   next up was the yellowtail yuzu soy, which was also incredible. i'm a bit biased though bc my love for salmon trumps all else, but this was honestly the best yellowtail i've had. flavors were light and citrusy and the flavor of the fish still shined through.   the twin dragon roll (alaskan king crab, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, avocado) was huge for the price we paid. local supermarkets where i live have dinky, terrible rolls for $8-12 and this was just a few bucks more and so so much more legit! this was my favorite roll at soho.   the triple s roll (scallops, shrimp, and something else? i can't remember) was good but not too memorable. the twin dragon was definitely better!   my black miso cod lettuce wraps came out after we had finished eating all the sushi and at that point i was pretty stuffed. i had an absolutely delectable miso cod dish at izakaya den in denver and was hoping for something similar but this was nothing close. the sweet sauce was too thick and heavy for the delicate fish and the hot fish on lettuce was just weird.   trout sashimi with pop rocks (compliments of the chef) arrived at the end of our meal. it was perfect because we had been so curious about it when we were looking at the menu... i didn't know if it would just be an insult to the fish or somehow epic. mm it was more the first than the second. i'm glad i didn't pay $$ for it and it was definitely generous of the chef to give us the opportunity to try such a unique dish! (seems like they do that a lot-- so nice.)   unfortunately, they were out of the supposedly amazing green tea tiramisu. next time!  and i'm serious. i am pretty much sick of the strip but i will come back to vegas just to visit soho! sushi that's hard to beat + super reasonable prices = one of the best of the best! :) :) :)",

    "text": "I would definitely need to come back the next time I make my way back to Vegas. My friend and I came during lunch. It wasn't very crowded, we were seated right away, and the food came out in a timely manner.   My friend ordered the bento box off the lunch menu. The bento box came with rice, meat, salad, sashimi, and pickled cucumbers. The meat was perfect! Especially dipped in their sauce.   We ordered the yellowtail yuzu soy to share. It was topped with fried jalepeno. I would definitely order this again!  I ordered the spicy soft shell crab. The reason why I only give Soho a 4 star is because it wasn't spicy at all. The roll had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, jalepeno, and spicy aioli. I had to order a side of jalepeno and that still wasn't enough spice for me.",

    "text": "After at least 5 visits in as many months, I decided now was the time to write an updated review.  The good news, is that this place is still deserving of a +++ 5 star rating.  a.  You have to really enjoy real Japanese food, seafood, and the infusion of subtle flavors in order to really reap the full benefits of this restaurant.    b. The only other restaurant now that I would say is close to this would be Yonaka over on the west side.  c.  Here is what I have found to be extremely consistent:  - Value - The place is an amazing value for the quality of food and the uniqueness as well!  Previous to Soho and Yonaka, I would get my fill of really unique Japanese from Nobu. I would easily pay 150.00 plus per person and while having a very good meal, I would feel like I did not get any great value.  Here at Yonaka, the value is amazing. From Uni to Hamachi Kama to Hydro Bibb, the prices, value and the quality of food is spectacular!.  You can pay for four people about 150.00 including tip if there is no alcohol or dessert.  - Chef - Chef John Chien is absolutely creative, welcoming and passionate about his craft. He is extremely consistent, very adventurous and is involved in all aspects of his restaurant.  He will wave at you and make you feel at home. Who doesn't love going home.  There is no place like home!  - Food - Everyone has already posted all the different menu items, the choices, menu and etc.  All I can add is that I am always excited to come here.  I am looking forward to ordering the same things, new things and what is on special.  The same things seem to always be unique and better tasting than the last time.  The new things are always such a wonderful delight and the specials are always so darn creative.  d.  Groundhog Day - Do you remember this Bill Murray movie where he lives the same day over and over again?  My favorite quote from this movie is \"I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank pina coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over.\"  If I had to live a day over, it would be dining at Soho every day.  It just gets better and better.  e. Quick hints - Always busy, off hours are going to be best, but still busy.   GK says, go for it.",

    "text": "O man, this is an amazing find when I'm visiting Vegas. I came in during a lunch rush, about 10 minutes after they had opened. The place was already filled with people but they seated us right away. No waiting :-). The hostess was quick with bringing us water and the waiter came to ask what we wanted. I told my sister about their awesome lunch special so we didn't take long deciding what we wanted. I ordered the lunch sashimi and she ordered the lunch sushi. Its a nice spacious restaurant and can fit a good deal of people. There's no fancy decoration but it was simple and all about the fish. Next time we might sit by the bar to meet the owner!   Sushi special: You definitely get your moneys worth!!! Cucumber, salad, miso, and fish for $8.50?! The quality of fish was really good, though I didn't care for the tuna. Miso soup was better than expected, full of flavor and.... TOFU! Most places skimp out on this and it's quite disappointing. The salad dressing was decent and the cucumber I ate in between to cleanse my palette. Out of all the fishes that they plated for the special I didn't care for tuna it the rest just melted in my mouth. Weird to say about fish.   I ordered a beef appetizer the one with pineapple (forgot it's name) since I remembered I enjoyed it a great deal during my first dining experience here. 10 minutes later our waiter Charles told us there wasn't enough to make a plate and I was extremely disappointed. He definitely made it up to us and made my experience a happier one :-)  Yellow tail... O my. It's just as I remembered the first time refreshingly tangy! Of course delicious! This is an absolute must when coming here, the fried jalapeno gives its an amazing crunchy texture.  Considering how busy it was with two waiters the service was excellent. Charles was great and sweet! As we were leaving he opened the door for us :-) we definitely felt pampered during this visit.   Probably won't stay a secret for long so go give it a try.",

Soho lovingly shares some of the best sashimi and other japanese treats I've enjoyed anywhere in the world.  In a strip mall.  Even our cabbie who's been in Las Vegas for ten years didn't know about it.    I'm going to tell everyone I know about Soho to and beyond the point of being obnoxious, it's that good.  I don't like Las Vegas, but I'm going to make sure my whole family comes here just to go to Soho.  It's that good.  The service was fantastic - thanks Sheila!  You can tell the whole team is having a good time with this project.  It's that good.   The signature hamachi with a light ponzu sauce is a must-have.  As is the garlic softshell crab.  As was the crispy spicy tuna roll.  And don't forget to ask if they have Wagyu when you go.  It's not on the menu, but they did have it and it was heavenly.  I could go on and show what piggly gourmands my business friend Tom and I were, but something should be left to imagingation.  I doubt there is anything less than wonderful on the menu.  It's that good.  There are plenty of excellent dining establishments on the strip, with much fancier decor.  But they don't deliver the quality and the heart and soul like Soho.  Help a cabbie make a fare and go to Soho!    I hope Lake Mead doesn't run dry, just so Soho can stay in business and prosper.  It's that good!  YES IT'S THAT GOOD!!!",

    "text": "Services: Upon entry, they are very kind and welcoming, with everyone yelling \"welcome\" including the sushi chefs behind the counter. The wait times, with a reservation, were within 5 minutes. They sat us down this is where they began to lose a bit of their steam. They asked us for drink upon sitting down and brought them, however we didn't hear from a server for a while. They came and asked for our order which by then are water cups were half way empty for most of us and they never came back to fill them, until after we began to get our food. The food times were decent, but servers wouldn't come by often to refill drinks or checkup.   Judgment of service: A bit slow      Food Quality: Most of the sushi tasted amazingly, some of the sashimi wasn't amazing, but almost all the food had a nice taste. All the fish was fresh and was prepared amazingly. Plus, the food times were great. We never had to wait long for anything we ordered, always had something to eat while enjoying our conversation. The presentation above all was the best part of the meal. The chefs worked quickly and gave attention to detail with all plates. Making the food look more delicious than it already seemed.    Judgment of food: Amazing      Cost: The cost seemed quite fair for the quality and presentation of the food. They take the time on each order and it shows. However much the services may lack, the food easily recovers for them. You are for the most part looking at about twenty-five to thirty-five per person for a decent meal. Judgment: Average      Atmosphere: The restaurant was very small, not giving much room between tables. Which took away from the food. It made you feel enclosed and didn't offer the privacy and comfort you would have expected with the quality of the food. However, the atmosphere was light and opening. The noise level was a bit above average voice, but you could still easily talk to your friends or date. This seems most of a party environment than a date because of the slightly more open and louder environment.       Judgment: Average  Over all it was a nice place with amazing food. The price is quite respectable for the food they are giving. I wouldn't recommend for a date night, but a great place for a small group of people. The service is a bit slow, however, everyone was very nice.",

Everything was well priced and fantastic tasting. Grant it, it was my birthday (I didn't realize so many people celebrated my birthday by wearing green, weird) anyhow...   Our guy, Oscar, was super friendly and made amazing dishes so we had to be those types that just snap chatted, social media'd the bejesus out of his arrangements. We took a lot of photos. Ask Oscar what you like and he will whip a roll or dish that fits perfectly And OMG the salmon avocado crime dish... yum yumdilliumcious. Everything was so good I didn't care I spent my birthday in the friend zone with my date. Had a great time thank you!",

    "text": "Amazing food and service. This is quality fusion sushi at affordable prices. Very comfortable establishment, super friendly staff. The owner chef John is such a nice guy and is a sushi genius. Sat at the sushi bar and had a great time.   We started with the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy cold appetizer which was a beautiful and succulent yellowtail sashimi. Melts in your mouth. This was hands down my favorite menu item of the evening. I *LOVE* yellowtail.     We also tried four different kinds of soho tostadas, salmon, shrimp, hamachi and tuna. SO GOOD. It is very unique and flavorful, you have to try it. It's only $2 each for a two-bite taste, delicious.   The seared tuna tartare was delicious, as was hamachi poke salad and albacore. The last item we tried was the philadelphia roll, which tasted much different than regular philly rolls because it is made with smoked salmon. Every bite was awesome.   See my pictures - words cannot alone describe the beautiful presentations.   Overall, the quality of the food and the presentation is what makes this a 5-star review. No AYCE menu, they don't need it - this is again about quality, not quantity. The service is excellent and everyone is just so nice, and they even have conversations with you unlike some other sushi establishments. I saw the chef go out to the tables and introduce himself which is so cool. Too bad we were so full, I really wanted to have some dessert as I read in other reviews how good they are.   Will DEFINITELY be back and am telling everyone about this hidden gem!",

This all changed for me when I ate a sushi burrito at SOHO. The most amazing sushi burrito yet. We asked the workers what makes them different and why is it so good. They told us we have to check out the actual SOHO Sushi restaurant where they make all the sauces. My wife and I had to visit and we were blown away. Chef Aaron took care of us and was just an awesome cool white guy which is unusual for a sushi chef. Great personality and he recommend some sushi that we that had never tried before. I am not surprised very often but flavors and quality of fish were off the charts and different from anywhere we had eaten before. The next time we visited we got a chance to meet Chef John the founder of SOHO. Just a great guy that has really extended his passion and personality to his whole staff and company. Chef Tate also amazing showed us the freshest 40 pounds of tuna just flown in from Japan. We sampled it and so amazing. We are back for the 3rd time and chef Tate is just taking great care of us again. We love to sit at the bar it makes it just so much fun. Thanks guys for great sushi and and even better staff.",

    "text": "Don't think this place needs another stellar review so I'll cut to the chase.  Sashimi plate (larger one) always fresh and the variety of sashimi is great (e.g. ahi, salmon, scallops, uni). Presentation is always cool (see shrimp stuffed in mouth of fish carcass). They'll fry the fish head for you too after you're done with the sashimi so you can pick off the meat or eat the eyeballs.   Japanese A5 wagyu is awesome rare. Gold flakes may be a little over the top but whatever, it's A5 wagyu! Meat like butter! The ponzu sauces that came with it overpowers the flavor of the meat. Bypass sauces; a little salt and pepper is all you need.  We picked off the menu board and got the prime Angus filet with uni butter. Tasted great, but we made the mistake of ordering this after the A5 so prime filet was almost like eating a gristly piece of pot roast. If we didn't make this mistake, it would've been much more awesome in my mind.  Scallops with foie gras was cooked perfect. Best part was that the foie gras on top was not some flimsy piece; it was about half the thickness of the scallop. A little rich, but cutting the servings in half did the trick.  Hate over-cooked scallops but SoHo always cooks it to melt-in-your-mouth perfection.  Sushi rolls were tasty but as long as the fish is fresh, rolls taste decent just about everywhere. Presentation is always spot on here, though.  This place never disappoints.",

First evening I had the Angus sliders off the $5.00 happy hour and with an order of fries I was quite full.  The waitress gave us a side order of salmon sashimi that was wonderful, so sure enough, we wound up getting 2 orders the next night. I thought the fries, egg, and oxtail was especially different and well done. The prices are very good, service is very good considering they were packed on a Wednesday evening, and all the servers are wonderful! I would definitely bring out of town guests here. They turned me into a sushi lover - in part because you know the fish will be fresh and because the staff is so knowledgeable.",

The location of the restaurant had me a little skeptical at first seeing that it's right next to Chevron but the overall experience won me over. The service was fantastic and our server Darrell was amazing! He was very attentive and answered all of our questions on the menu plus added some of his own recommendations which were all fantastic! We started off with the salmon, yellowtail, and trout sashimi appetizers and all were delicious! The miso cod was our favorite cooked just right with excellent marination. The head chef/owner came out to our table and introduced himself with such a friendly attitude. We ended with the green tea tiramisu and I highly recommend it if you're looking to end your meal right! Now I know why they're rated 5 stars and I look forward to coming back!",

We ordered a sashimi special and it was amazing.  The owner came over and asked how everything was and then offered a sample of a dish he recommended.  I can't remember what it was, but it was delicious as well.  Although it wasn't on the menu, I ordered an eel roll.  If you don't see something on the menu, just ask, they may have it!  The eel was so awesome!  Usually when I order eel, it is tough and has tiny little bones.  Well, this eel practically melted in my mouth, no joke!  I summoned the owner over and he asked how everything was and I asked him how his eel was so good, while others were not.  Apparently they only use a certain part of the eel if I remember correctly.  A tad pricey, but this is not your standard cheap sushi, IMO. If you want quality you can taste, come here!",

And the sushi was good. Was it the most amazing sushi we've ever had? No, but it was good. The factors that left more to be desired: the decor of the restaurant and number of sushi options. If you want a restaurant with a cool atmosphere and ambient lighting, this is definitely not the place. I would definitely revisit this restaurant, but for lunch. When I want to go out on a Friday or Saturday night, this wouldn't be top on my list. It reminded me more of a cafeteria, and hence why I have it three stars. If rating solely on freshness and quality of rolls, I'd give it a 4.",

No big deal, as I found the boba tea sitting right next to it actually served very good boba tea. ;) Prbly because we were the first customers on that day, we got complimentary yellowtail sashimi, which is absolutely excellent. My friend was never a fan of sashimi, but was shocked to find out how good it is.  We got a crispy tuna roll, very unique and I luv it. The garlic soft shell crab is also cooked perfectly. This is the fourth time I'm in Vegas, I'd say this is prbly the best dining experience in town  Oh, forgot to mention, Most importantly, the price is very reasonable.",

The food here is always fresh and beautifully prepared. Chef John is amazing and makes wonderful sushi/sashimi, not to mention that he is super nice. He ended up giving us platter of free salmon sashimi after finding out that I am a big fan of salmon! The servers here are also friendly despite being such a busy restaurant. Definitely my favorite sushi restaurant from here on out.   I highly recommend everyone to try their sashimi; I have never tasted more fresh and delicious sashimi in town. So far I have tried the Salmon Wasabi, Yellowtail Yuzu, and Garlic Seared White Fish --- all wonderful. I'm now making my way to try every sashimi offered on the menu (and special menu)!",

This place specializes in flavorful sashimi platters($11-13 per plate), which is something you must get if you're trying this place out! My friend and I got the salmon wasabi cream that had wasabi creme fraiche, roe, crispy shallots, and a yuzu soy dressing; the quality of the ingredients was wonderful and the salmon seemed to melt in your mouth. Then we also split a tuna box roll (which was delicious and unique) and a spicy tuna roll. However, the BEST PART of this entire experience was that our waitress came to us to ask if we wanted any dessert and when we said no, she gave us a complimentary green tea tiramisu anyways! It was so so so amazingly yummy! As some of these other reviews have stated, complimentary food giving is fairly common at this restaurant and I think that absolutely wonderful. It gives incentive for customers to go back frequently for that, the food, and the service.",

You can choose from Green Tea cheesecake or mochi ice cream.   We got the sashimi set and the teriyaki salmon set. The sashimi were appropriately cut, you taste the freshness and sweetness of the fish. The teriyaki salmon was moist. The teriyaki sauce is played on a ramekins so you can control the amount of teriyaki sauce on you salmon.   The baked muscles and oyster were just a good. The baked muscles were very meaty.   The chef also threw in complimentary trout sashimi on a bed of ponzu . It was fresh with interesting texture from the pop rock. It's with the try.   Service was excellent. The staff was very knowledgeable of the menu. They were very friendly.   The $3.00 sangria is delicious.  Their happy hour menu is a Real Deal! $5.00 sushi roll and drinks range from $3-$18.",

I rarely write reviews but I don't think this place deserve 4.5 stars. Either people around the area never had real sushi or they just don't know what good quality or fresh fish is suppose to taste like!   The food was overpriced for the quality. Even the services couldn't make up for the horrible food. My friend took her family and myself out for dinner when I came to visit and we order a lot of food and they would first take forever to bring out the food and bring it out one at a time.

    "text": "Do not drive past this one place! It's very unassuming from the outside but the quality & freshness of the sushi is comparable, if not better than anything on the strip. At a fraction of the price.   Sat at the sushi bar & was served by Chef Oscar. The care and expertise he used to slice & create was awesome to watch. The pride he has of his craft was obvious. Check out the sashimi platter picture. That's Golden Eye Snapper adorning that platter.   Besides eating with your eyes, the taste did not disappoint! Totally fresh, great cuts of fish. Chef Oscar added a bit of roe here, a little uni there to completely elevate the nigiri. Didn't skimp on the thickness of the sashimi, either.   Great meal, fantastic value, fun experience. What more do you want?",

    "text": "One can easily distinguish Soho from any other typical local sushi spot. Their menu serves up the most unique style of modern Japanese that you'd only expect to eat at an on-strip five star establishment. The saying is True \"...never eat sushi on a Sunday.\" Fish markets are closed therefore the sushi establishments cannot serve fresh fish. Chef John, a former executive chef of City Center's Social House, is a dedicated restaurant owner who is working the kitchen every day but Sunday. He serves his customers nothing but the best with the freshest ingredients. This is, by far, my favorite local restaurant; not just for sushi!   I came here for the first time a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love. Chef John blew us away by serving us a complementary yellowtail sashimi as welcoming us to his restaurant. At the time, I wasn't big on raw fish but was always open to trying new things and glad I did. Since then, I became what some would call a \"real\" sushi eater. Now all I want is the raw stuff! Soho has spoiled me with the freshest fish that I no longer like having it anywhere else. To be honest, I get grossed out. You can really taste the difference. In addition, the hospitality cannot be beat. I feel like I'm walking into a good friend's home every time I enter their dining room. I'm greeted with the same happy faces and there is Chef John hard at work in the kitchen. My husband knows almost every time he asks me where I want to eat what my answer will be. Yup, that's how much I love this place!   P.s try the Ocean Trout with pop rock candy and the Yellowtail topped with fried Serrano peppers!",

The quality of their fish is simply the best you can get, and this is Vegas baby. The service is always outstanding and make sure you treat them well because they deserve it. Don't bother reading haters reviews, they are just unhappy people that are jealous and trolls.  This place deserves 999.999.999.999^(infinity) stars.",

    "text": "Unlike other Sushi or Asian restaurants, Soho is trendy in red-accent decor.  The service is definitely one crucial factor which made its great reputation.  Our server, Sheila, is attentive and knowledgeable on the food items and gave great suggestions.   - UNI DUO: Santa Barbara uni is way sweeter and tastes better than Catalina Uni. Great Santa Barbara uni is a must order to me.  - SHORT RIB: This popular item doesn't make a wow for me and my Asian guests. We didn't finish it. It is good, but for Asians, it's not new flavor.   - HAMACHI KAMA: Juicy, tender to melt in the mouth, and with sophisticated presentation. Will come back for it.  - COD: This popular item is a little too sweet for me. But my guests loved it.  - UME SCALLOPS: It was fishy and the color doesn't look pleasant. I myself and my scallop-lover friend were hesitated to finish it. Sheila reflected to the Chef and removed it from our charges even we insisted there is no need to do so.  - STUFFED MUSHROOMS: Very thick mushrooms and generous stuffing. 3 pieces per order.  - SALMON AVOCADO ROLL: Very creamy and mellow to slide into your stomach.    - SAKE: I preferred lychee sake and my guest liked the peach sake. Both came in elegant and transparent tear-drop shape kettle. Beautiful and interesting.   Will have to come back for more other items.",

This I believe was one of the highest yelp rated restaurant in vegas.    It wasn't that busy and there were no wait.  There's little bit of wait after happy hour.  During happy hour most item there are round $5 and has alcohol drink as well.  I don't think this place is japanese owned but korean.  Food quality is good in most part.  My favorite thing was the baked mussels, those are fresly cook and very delicious.  The salmon avocado sushi roll was pretty good as well.  Other item I try was just mediocre, the sashimi one wasn't that good.  Overall is pretty good but just little bit you can get ayce all over vegas...",

Filet was sooooo tender also had three unreal dipping sauces. Short rib was melt in your mouth Super Rich flavor. Salmon moist tender with great steamed veggies. Last but not least Hamachi collar with the cheek meat as well.... Perfectly cooked with a great dipping sauce and grilled lemon. Whew....

Since it was our fist time we let him pick everything for us and let me say nothing was disappointing!!!! We started with the chip things (don't remember what it's called) they were amazing! Then we did the cod with lettuce which was also great. The seared tuna special is also really good. My favorite roll was the twin dragon roll! Overall everything he picked for us was so satisfying.

I ordered two sashimi dishes: the yellowtail yuzu soy and the salmon creme. I love citrus so when I saw the word \"yuzu\" I knew I had to try them, and I was not disappointed! Both dishes were amazing because the freshness and cut of the fish were of exceptional quality. For sashimi like this, it was reasonably priced as well.   Along with this, I pretty much mooched off of my other 2 family members who ordered a sashimi and nigiri lunch setto. These came with a bowl of rice, salad, miso soup, and pickled cucumbers. They both agreed that the fish was fresh and the sides were great. We ordered a twin dragon roll as well, and though it was good, it didn't really blow me away compared to other \"special\" sushi rolls I've tried in the past.   This was lunch time, but I know the dinner menu has even more to offer so I'd like to go back for dinner some time. Overall, great quality fish and service.",

    "text": "I ate here about 3 days ago for the first time.. Only because its very close to my house AND because of Yelp. This place got 5 out of 5 stars!! I had a dinner date with two of my girlfriends and I chose this place for us. I was sure that we wouldn't be disappointed bc of all the positive reviews... But I was wrong! Kind of... Service was very slow. We still hadn't gotten our main dishes after thirty minutes... And we asked our server twice about our food.. She told us twice that she'd check... and then nothing. We did get our appetizers.. Slowly. Staff seems kind of all over the place..well anyway, after waiting... And we were starving, my friends got upset and wanted to leave.  So we asked for our check and told the server to cancel our orders. Then as we were getting up to leave the table, suddenly the server appears with all our food in her arms!! My friends asked me if I still wanted to stay and since the food was already made, I said yes of course. I just don't understand why our food took so long. We didn't order special rolls or anything. Just sashimi..AND the restaurant was not busy! Well we decided to stay..(although we were in a grumpy mood by then) and then the owner of the restaurant came out and apologized for the slow service! He asked us to please at least try the food and that it will all be comped. Everything we ordered was absolutely amazing. I actually came back today for a late lunch, this time bringing my sister.. The food here is so good that it actually makes up for the kind of slow service. Today when we walked in, nobody greeted us. This guy that was wiping up a table just said 'how many?' Without even making eye contact. When I asked if they had dessert, the server said he didn't know bc it's his first day. I get it. Maybe service is slow bc the employees are new??! I only came back here bc the food was so good... But I do think the staff needs a little work. The owner seems to care a lot about what his customers think, which I think is wonderful. He came out and greeted me, telling me thank you for coming back, also sending us free scallop sashimi dish. Our last order of beers were forgotten by another server, so we were given complimentary sake shots. Overall... I want to love this place as a whole. I love the food for sure.. This is why I will return... But I hope the service catches up too.",

We ordered several items from the happy hour and regular menu. My favorites were the Cajun Albacore, Firecracker roll, and the Sunny Salmon Roll.  You HAVE TO TRY THE SUNNY SALMON ROLL. I can't even put words together to describe the delightful surprise of flavors that you taste, so you're just gonna have to take my word for it and try it yourself.  We also had the cold peach saki which was delicious! At the end of our dinner, the head chef came over to us, introduced himself, thanked us for our business, and later brought over a complementary sashimi dish of yellowtail, which was fantastic.  Soho is a small place so there will most likely be a wait around happy hour, but it's definitely worth it. I'll definitely be coming here again very soon!",

    "text": "I think 4.5 stars overall for this place totally makes sense. The fish was really fresh and the service was awesome. We were lucky that it wasn't super busy when we were there still great .. busy enough for Thursday night though. We came hungry and started with the Oysters first. I loved that they have options to add Uni and the Ikura on top of the Oysters. We did that and it was delicious.   I personally loved the Duo Tuna that you can choose the kind ( fat or lean). The Duo was yummy! The Shishito peppers was good but I expected to get some spicy one but got none. Hamachi Kama was very tasty. The skin was crispy outside and the fish meat was soft and tasty inside. We had it with the Ponzu sauce.   For the price range compared to what we got, it was very good. We satisfied what we expected and felt it was worth the trip to swing by. The look from the outside of the restaurant could be misleading as it was in a general looking shopping complex. I think this was so much better deal than many places in the strip.   The food came out so fast too. Highly recommend!",

I have dreams about that ocean trout, yellowtail yuzu soy and salmon creme fraiche.  Not to be overlooked, the sashimi and oysters are incredibly fresh.  Chef John has put a lot of thought into his menu.  You won't find a million choices like some joints but everything is prepared with great attention to detail and presentation.  I regularly get the Chef's sashimi platter if I am with a group.  My favorite roll is currently the Diabla Loca Roll ( a newer addition to the menu), but my \"favorite\" depends on the day of the week.  I am also a big fan of those Japanese pickles.  So salty and tasty.  A perfect compliment to the fresh fish.  I could go on and on about the quality of the food and the attention to detail that goes into the preparation, but I might run out of space to mention the great service.  All the servers are genuinely welcoming and provide excellent service.  Sheila is my favorite, but probably because she remembers us as the OG regulars when this place was not a rockstar on Yelp.    Lastly, I was finally able to make it in for happy hour here and I must say, Chef John is getting robbed! Happy hour prices are an unbelievable deal, especially when considering the caliber of food you are getting.  Believe the hype surrounding this restaurant.  Soho deserves all the accolades.",

I love going to the best places and sushi sounded great, so I found my way into the restaurant around 8pm for another solo dining experience. Honestly, I don't even have to look for another off the strip sushi spot in Vegas. THIS PLACE IS EVERYTHING. I ordered exactly right and can't wait to come back to try what else they recommend. This ginger hamachi dish was suggested by the server and I'm stoked I ordered it. It had the perfect mix of crunch, spice and delicious sauce. The soft shell crab is actually a salad. It's underrated the way it's described on the menu but definitely give it a go if you want to try a unique hot dish. The salmon was also very good. I'm seriously so happy I ventured out this evening. This place will be a go to for as long as I crave sashimi in Vegas.",

The waitress (Patty) handed us the menu and mentioned it's still happy hours. After a minute looking at the happy hours menu,  we decided to ask the young sushi chef (Aaron) what he would recommend because we didn't really know the menu but want to take advantage of the happy hours (which we didn't know or expected from a highly rated restaurant). Aaron asked if we like sushi or sashimi more and we said Sashimi. He recommended a few and we ordered as recommended. Aaron said not to worry about the happy hours cut-off and take our time. His attitude was very cool and made us feel very welcoming. Aaron  prepared some awesome dishes for us and they were very good.  We invited Aaron to drink Sake with us and eventually got John & Oscar plus Patty to join us... it was like celebrating our anniversary with a bunch of close friends and we had such a fantastic time with them.  The bill came out to be much less than expected and I honestly thought they miscalculated because a sashimi dinner like what we just had and the many bottles of Sake we drank,  I was expecting 2x or 3x the amount.  Now the food: EXCELLENT QUALITY, INCREDIBLY TASTETY, AND BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED.  Hands down the best sushi experience we have ever had.  Thanks SOHO!  Tracy & James",

Their happy hour menu is amazing -- you get all the best things are discounted prices which mean you can order twice as much for the same price!!! Yes!  2. Cajun albacore -- I don't usually eat raw fish but when I do it's only here and it's only Cajun albacore. This comes with this amazing sauce, jalapenos, and is out of this world. Oh and you can order it at happy hour so...score!!!  3. Cucumber sake -- this is the most smooth sake I have ever had and we drank 2 bottles the first time and 2 again ever subsequent time...so try it!!!   4. Their waitstaff -- they work as a team so you're never waiting or wanting for anything! Someone will be there to refill your water or add to your order without saying \"oh let me get your server\" I like when people work together.   5. Sheila's recommendations -- if you aren't sure what to order, ask a server!!! Sheila is my favorite but as I mentioned above, they work together so no one will steer you wrong!!! And if you go often enough they bring you speciality items at no additional cost just because they want you to try something!!!",

First time we tried the crispy brussel sprouts and it was fabulous! Shrimp tempura roll is always my go-to and it was great.

    "text": "This is another great restaurant in the Southwest that hasn't received too much attention lately, judging from my Yelp friends. Fortunately, my IRL friend didn't forget.  One of her favorite local restaurants is Soho Japanese Restaurant, and I was honored that she invited me here on her farewell tour before her relocation to a new city. They're a great modern/fusion restaurant with a menu full of raw fish. If this sounds familiar, that's because there are definitely other local places doing something similar. But I still think this is one of the most affordable, as demonstrated with their happy hour menu, while not sacrificing quality.  I'd heard that they'd taken away the happy hour menu for a while, but they brought it back recently with a vengeance. Five drinks and eleven food items are available for $5 (with the sole exception of tyku sake at $10) starting at [UPDATE 9/12/17: 4pm, don't have to wait until 5pm now] and ending at 7pm every night. We mostly stuck to this menu, save for one ear-catching special of the night mentioned by the server.  Escolar Carpaccio (5 pc): EVOO, Italian seasoning, chives, white ponzu, truffle salt. The fish most commonly served elsewhere as \"super white tuna\" gets a full array of delicious complements here. If you're a fan of super white, you'll be a fan of this. I really liked the smoky charred seasoning on each bite. We ordered seconds of just this dish.  Cajun Albacore Sashimi (5 pc): serrano chili, red onion, spicy garlic, creamy ponzu, shredded daikon. In retrospect, I wish I'd ordered it again because that luscious albacore melted perfectly in my mouth. It's not too spicy overall either.  Crispy Brussel Sprouts (many pc.): citrus butter, roasted pine nuts, more shredded daikon. The sprouts weren't quite as crunchy as I'd hoped, but the pine nuts helped and the citrus butter is my newest addiction. The acidity is subtle, but the richness is front and center and needs to be in every bite. Just soak up that heavenly juice.  Tadas (5 pc): the tostadas may have lost a syllable, but they've kept all of the flavor. We tried the mixed fish order first, which had a huge array of fish and veggies, and then the salmon, which I'm pretty sure is the same old Japanese-influenced pico de gallo mixture. My only issue was the need to portion it out onto the fried wontons ourselves, for which they provide a serving spoon and a reasonable portion of yuzu avocado spread. I'd rather have it pre-portioned in roughly equal amounts as in the original version instead of having to do work and guess.  (Well, one more regret: I did write that I enjoyed the tuna tostadas the most in my first visit, but I forgot about them tonight. Until next time then...)  Amberjack salsa ($14, 6 pc): when the server described the special dishes available tonight, I _figuratively_ jumped out of my chair at the word \"amberjack\" and my friend seemingly did the same. What a fantastic fish. I could've eaten the delicious kanpachi alone here. Appropriately enough, all of the accompaniments were so subtle and indistinguishable to the taste (even the cherry tomatoes) that I may as well have been eating just the fish. It's ironic that, as a composed dish, this was the least impressive order. Perhaps it's one of their experiments that they're conducting for their seasonal menu change (which the server mentioned briefly).  After the removal and return of a revamped happy hour menu, Soho still stands as one of the great local restaurants that happens to be a tremendous value during happy hour. I'm gonna have to come back soon, so as a note to myself, the top of my \"whoops, forgot about that\" list are the tuna tadas and the hydro bibb sea bass. The rest will fall into place easily.",

My mom's wheelchair is the narrow kind as she is a petite lady and we had trouble getting to our table without having to ask every one to scoot in a bit. Plus the bathroom in the women's room-- well it's bigger and has safety bars, but accessible it ain't. I had to leave mom's wheelchair outside of the stall in order to her situated. I don't think the restaurant says they are wheelchair accessible-- yelp does, so no knock on Soho for that.  I really enjoyed my meal so I would come back-- just not with my mom unfortunately. The sushi pieces were huge, but not obscenely so (you know those places) and well priced. We went for the Uni Duo and wow, that was worth it. Other than sushi we got a beef tostada that was really delicious and had great texture (although a little heat would have been nice!), and my husband really enjoyed his yakitori. Service was friendly when we could get it. May go back for a date night with the hubs and just sit at the counter.  To summarize: not wheelchair friendly especially if you need to use the premises' bathroom, & sushi was fresh, well priced, and well portioned.",

    "text": "Alright, so I've finally gotten around to writing this review and.... this place DESERVES 5 FREAKING STARS!  Soho is opened by Chef John who was one of the executive chefs at Social House at Crystals.  I cannot stress enough how good the food is here. Especially the sashimi. I know it takes years to be able to master cutting sashimi. It's not as simple as just slicing a cut of fish. And Chef John is amazing. Plus he selects only premium quality fish.  First time we came here was just by chance. It was about 4pm and we were hungry. I had heard about Soho through some co-workers and so we decided to check it out. They were serving happy hour during that time and so we ordered some tostadas and a few rolls. We had noticed how good the tuna had been. Towards the end of that meal Chef John came out and was introducing himself to all of his customers. He came by and spoke with us for a little and then told us he was going to send over the house special Yellowtail Ponzu Soy.. pffft. BOMB. SO DAMN GOOD. It was melt in your mouth sashimi.  The service is not bad. It's not fine dining so don't expect them to be hoovering over you. Although they are still pretty attentive. The storefront is very misleading as it looks very generic and plain. But Chef John really puts effort into his restaurant. During one visit we came for lunch we got a small little sushi keychains when we got the check.   YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE. If you can appreciate great sushi and sashimi then this place is for you. The sashimi melts in your mouth and the uni is the BEST uni I've ever, EVER had.  **side note: being from an island and having been to Japan. The quality of fish/sushi here is definitely not taken lightly.",

We were running late and every time I called to check in, they told us not to worry and never once made us feel bad. Last thing you need in Vegas is dinner to be canceled. Upon arrival, they surprised us with complimentary sake to start off the night - best tasting ever. Having a large group, we decided to do omakase. Due to our late arrival, we had to hustle thru dinner to make an event. Dinner did not feel rush, dishes were timed perfectly, and we were getting full before our last dishes so we stop. They provided candles for our cupcakes which they were able to store as it was delivered earlier.   TLTR: The food was amazing and the staff was stellar.

The restaurant is pretty modest but clean and casual. The menu is imaginative with specials rotating around the freshest seafood. Tried the fresh uni, Hydro Bibb black cod, salmon wasabi cream and green tea tiramisu. Everything was good if not stellar. On one occasion, I ordered an octopus salad, one of their specials of the evening. The server claimed that the octopus was from Spain and that they were testing the dish to see if it should be a mainstay. They were asking for their customer's opinions. The octopus was tender and the vinaigrette was sweet and spicy. In other words, I hope that octopus salad becomes a regular dish.  They also serve affordable lunch specials even during the weekends. At under $9, the sashimi box set is a steal. The restaurant is Strip quality but strip mall affordable. Besides the great food, what really separates Soho from others is the staff who seem genuine and eager to please their customers.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Specialty - Their specialty is sashimi with different sauces on top. Each plate is around 10 dollars and has 6 slice of fish. They are a bit more inventive than your normal sashimi dishes.        - Decor - The outside is in a strip mall that's not too great to look at. Inside however, it looks like a trendy hot spot, much like the soho part of it's name suggests.        - Price - The price will set you back a bit and the portions are tiny, but this place is more for the experience and tasting new things. **Ordered**        - $18 Miso Marinated Black Cod - Easily the best piece of cooked fish I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of miso sweetness.        - $12 Chicken Salad - Chicken was grilled pretty well. Moist inside with a grilled outside.        - $10 Yellowtail Sashimi - I love their twist of making the jalapenos tempura style.         - $11 Seared Tuna Special - The ponzu sauce was complimented very well with the slight sweetness of the onion & the sweet green sauce.        - $11 Ocean Trout - By far my favorite. It tasted like really fresh salmon. When you put it in your mouth, the pop rocks, yes, pop rocks start popping and it's a very different experience. The sweetness of the candy works with the freshness of the fish to produce a very different and delicious experience.        - Uni - A couple flakes of sea salt on these uni slices really brought out the flavor. Fresh and good. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a fancy sashimi place on date night.",

The happy hour items are $1-5, pretty much a steal for the quality of food you are receiving.  They have $1 salmon, hamachi, tuna, and tako tostadas.  The only one I didn't try was the tako, the other three were delicious in flavor and the fish was extremely fresh.  The hydro bib black cod is essentially miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The miso cod is buttery smooth in texture and the flavoring is a good salty sweet combination.  The stuffed mushrooms are fried little balls of delight with an aioli dipping sauce.  I could have eaten 3 orders of these little mushrooms.  All the rolls and the baked mussels are your normal fare at most sushi restaurants, so if you want something different I would order the other items on the HH menu.  I did like that the spicy tuna roll, since it had more of a spicy kick to it, rather than being overwhelmed with mayonnaise.  Another favorite was the cajun albacore sashimi, incredibly fresh fish and quite a large portion given the price.  We also tried the ika geso, which is essentially squid karaage with a great aioli dipping sauce.  We also ordered the sashimi platter which was a generous portion for $25 and all of the items were extremely fresh.  The chef did pop over to see if it was our first time and even sent out a complimentary dish of yellowtail yuzu and a fresh uni portion.  The place and location is unassuming, tucked into a small plaza with some random stores.  The decor is simple and minimalistic.  The best part is that the HH is Monday-Saturday 4-6pm!  I'd come earlier to make sure you get a table!",

We had tuna tatas to start. Wow how yummy they were can not be described in words. We also had a bottle is saki that was recommended by the server $12 special silver Tyku.  Then we had the 12 pieces sashimi platter. Each platter is different and ours was spectacular and had 16 pieces of sashimi that was a visual feast, including two types of fish eggs. Then tempura, and two sushi rolls, spicy tuna roll and firecracker roll. This came out with a complimentary 4 piece plate of tuna sashimi with ponzu sauce. We finished with vanilla creme brulee and mochi (supposed to get 3 but I was served one of each of the 4 flavors!).  The service was spot on and the flow of the meal excellent.  We loved our meal and the entire place.",

Randomly say down with some friends of mine that had been recommended this place and we came and sat at the sushi bar. The owner?? (Chef John) served us and we started with the sampler platter and worked our way down the menu. We had uni, Tuna Takaki salad, cucumber salad and just about everything else and ended with fresh mochi and a green tea Cree brulee. Right??    I'll just make a long story short. After driving 8 hours, being 9:00 at night it was the perfect way to end a great day.   Find your way here and you won't regret it...and ask for Chef John if you really want VIP service. If you speak Taiwanese  you might even get a break on dessert :)",

Based on the Yelp reviews, I was expecting it to be good, but I was blown away by how incredible it was.  We sat at the sushi counter, so we were able to watch the chefs prepare everything we ate.  They truly are artists.  The sashimi platter was stunning, and they charge only $35 for it.  It would be at least $75 at Nobu.  We had the yellowtail appetizer, the roast chicken, the A5 Japanese steak, Nigerian prawns, Toro, pork belly, and a couple of their speciality rolls.  It was all phenomenal.  The fish is all Nobu quality and a fraction of the cost.  I understand that the chefs all came from high end placed, but the rent is much lower on Jones, so they pass the savings onto the customers.  If you like Japanese food, go.  It doesn't get any better.",

We were last here on a Friday night, and even though the restaurant was busy, we never waited for food and the service from our server (and busser, and food runner, and everyone who works there really) was as if we were one of only a few tables - as usual.  Some of our favorites that we have to get:  Firecracker Roll, Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, Ocean Trout sashimi (with pop rocks!), King Crab Tempura, Rock Shrimp Tempura, and we ALWAYS ask about new/temporary items (order it, and always enjoy that too!). You wouldn't necessarily think to order short ribs from a sushi restaurant, but theirs are to die for!  This is our go-to place when we want an all-around great meal and great dining experience. All of our out-of-town friends ask to be taken here, too, when they come to Vegas.",

It's affordable, so pace yourself over several trips. I would have given 5 stars, but there rolls are a distant second to the rest of the lunch and dinner menus. A True sushi restaurant should master rolls, sashimi, and nigiri.

If you're looking for a place for fresh fish and generous cuts of sashimi then this is the place to check out.   As we walked in the staff was very tentative and were seated right away. As we sat we received our drink order and our waitress Julie ran us through the menu and listed out her favorites as she emphasized on the sashimi. We heard a lot of good things about Chef Lee and his attention to sashimi, so the wifie and I decided on the 15 piece sashimi plate along with some house favorites which were the ocean trout with pop rocks (pop rocks went well with the trout as it acted more as a texture touch rather than adding taste) and the yellow tail with ponzu sauce (clean fresh taste, ponzu paired perfect with the yellow tail).    As the sashimi plate came out the first thing that caught my eye were the generous cuts of fish. Our plate consisted of three pieces of tuna, three pieces of scallop (light and sweet as this was the wifies favorite); three pieces of saba; two pieces of red snapper; two pieces of salmon; and two pieces of Hamachi kama (my favorite as it was so so buttery it left a silky feeling in your mouth). As we were close to finishing to our surprise Chef Lee greeted us at our table and ask how we were doing. He also brought out one of his special dishes on the house, sea bass with olive oil and truffle salt (very simple clean tasting in which every element went well together).   Soho is one of my favorites. Personable chef and friendly staff with one of the best sashimi in town.",

    "text": "As a big sushi lover, I decided to take my first trip to Soho Japanese Restaurant based on all the positive yelp reviews.  Believe the hype! This restaurant is 5 stars all the way around.  The staff was overly friendly. Great customer service as well as great suggestions on house specials. I never had to wait for a refill on my drinks. The servers were very attentive to guests needs.  The owner who is also a chef really went out of his way to ensure we had the best experience possible. He was very friendly and personable touching all the tables to see how everything was going. After letting him know it was our first time there he made us a special sampler on the house comprised of Ocean Trout & Scallops which was way better than I expected it to be. (I had a bad experience with scallops at another restaurant)   Being it was our first time we tried a bit of everything and I cant say anything negative about any of the dishes. I will list what we had below.  Starters: Miso Soup Seaweed Salad Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer  Spicy Tuna Handroll Sashimi Sampler of Ocean Trout & Scallops (a gift from the owner/chef)  Speciality Rolls: Twin Dragon Roll Spicy Softshell Crab Roll Firecracker Roll   The price was very reasonable compared to alot of other places in Vegas. Ended our meal with some really cool sushi key chains.   Overall this place gets 5 stars and is my new favorite spot for sushi.",

What to expect is fresh fish, quality preparation and great customer service! If you have ever ate on the strip at the famous Social House then that is the type of service and quality food you will get (maybe even better!)-- and at HALF THE PRICE!! Support Las Vegas small businesses and eat here!!   My favorites are:  Miso Cod on top of butter lettuce cups Salmon Wasabi Creme Sashimi ALL of the tostadas--specifically the POKE Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapenos Everything SASHIMI....you know its fresh when you try the UNI =)  Too much too mention!!  Lunch Specials are $8.50 can't go wrong with that!!   LOVE this place and the STAFF!! =)",

Everything the waitress suggested was delicious.  We enjoyed the ume scallop, hamachi in a yuzu sauce, sashimi platter(mmmm, good), ika geso (ok), hamachi kama( a very generous portion, delicious), mussels (ono), kurobuta wrapped in bacon (yum), hydro bib black cod (a winner!!), fire cracker roll, spicy tuna roll, california roll and tempura roll.  The rolls were just ok...the next time I don't think we need to order any rolls.  We enjoyed the lychee sake (very reasonable at $5 happy hour price.    Prices are very reasonable and the quality, superb.  Can't wait to go back the next time we visit Las Vegas.  Note: Read the yelp reviews before going and wasn't disappointed.",

The mussels and sausage wrapped in bacon would be a pass if I ate there again.    Also I would pass on the yellowail yuzo soy if I went back.  The one roll I had was good but can't remember the name and there is no good online menu.  Even with ordering mostly happy hour food it was about 75 dollars for two with no alcohol so not exactly cheap.",

Whatever you decide to choose, it comes with rice, soup, and salad. The portions are perfect. You can still order off of the dinner menu during lunch, but all in all, the quality and taste of the food is satisfying. For dessert, I recommend trying the green tea tiramisu. It is to die for!!!! Just some quick tips, if you're a sashimi lover, you will just taste the freshness and high quality of the fish. If you're a California roll lover, they use real crab instead of imitation crab.  The whole staff is awesome. The owner, John, is super friendly and welcoming. Every time that I've gone to Soho, he comes up to the table to ask how everything is. You can tell he's very passionate with what he does and wants to make sure that you're having a good experience.",

    "text": "Although I don't EVER write reviews, I felt compelled to write a review from my experience here. Our group of 5 share in this bliss with me.  After a failed attempt to go to Bachi Burger (closed for maintenance the 1 day we wanted to go) we decided to Yelp another location. Randomly jumped back on Yelp as I started driving; light turned green, car started moving, executive decision whip a majorly illegal U-turn. Nonetheless we got there.  First thing we (at least the males of the group) noticed were the $4 drafts of Asahi Dry. Done and done.  Expecting this to be a normal sushi joint, we just order a few things to gauge the sushi quality. Our 2 friends decide to ask if they would do omakase, and the waiter said he'd ask the chef/owner if this was okay. Let me tell you, those 2 made the best decision of the trip.  Having heard that we wanted omakase, the chef/owner John decided to pay our table a visit (he visited almost every table while we were there dining). Asked what kind of dished the guys would like, but mainly we just left it up to him.  2 of our group shared the tostados and were amazed how good they were, so I decided to order all 6 that were on the menu. These little things were packed with so much flavor in various forms. No two were the same and they were just great.  For the rest of us that didn't get the omakase, here's how we ended up Tostados  Hamachi Tako Albacore Philly Roll Angus Beef Tataki  I love my philly roll for some reason, and right when I ate the first piece, I was confused. The fish quality and texture alone were completely different than anything I have ever had. Maybe I'm still a n00b to great sushi, but I have definitely not had that texture from DC, Cali, NYC, Boston or anywhere else I've ever eaten sushi.  The rest of the sashimi was just as good and at that point we knew we were in for a treat.  Tuna poke that was special reminded me of Hawaii. The flavors were nice and acidic with that mellow undertone of sesame oil.  Tuna, sliced beef, fish, oysters, uni, EVERYTHING we had was good. For some odd reason there is a beef short rib on the menu, and even that was good. The guys got that as part of their omakase and it is normally a $30 item at any \"fine dining\" place. They had about 6 or 7 courses in their tasting.. the grand total $40 for their omakase. Simply amazing.  By the end of the night we were wanting to throw money at the owner. Literally. They forgot to include the omakase in our bill at first, but we felt so compelled to pay them and told them to correct our bill. Sub $250 bill with beers, 2 omakases, a ton of other dishes for 5 people. Can't be beat.  Chef John even prepared a few special things not on menu for us to all try. Simply amazing. Seriously, if we didn't have a flight to catch, we were all in agreement we would've just stayed there and said, here's $100, do what you can. Having had tastings from some of the best chefs in the US, this one would surely be right up there with all of them.  Don't like the food, just fly back into Vegas, and I'll go again with you to taste it again. Chef John Lee, kudos to you sir. After 3 months and the reviews of this place are already pegging your restaurant as one to look out for.",

Upon trying SoHo I was nothing but surprised and astounded by the quality, friendliness and overall satisfaction. The fish is the freshest I've tasted short of the finest on the strip and selection is to die for. This place will rival and destroy any sushi restaurant you know.

    "text": "John- please come and check on dinner service at Soho. I miss lunch there and still don't understand why you changed to dinner only. Your lunch regulars would gladly have paid 2-3 more for that excellent lunch box. As for dinner last night, I was disappointed in the presentation. The trout is now presented on a dark clay plate which made me realize how much you taste with your eyes. It just wasn't as appealing. My favorite uni came out on this weird giant plate of ice and by the time I got towards the end it had become orange goo. One bright spot was the brussel sprouts which were excellent.  The food tasted pretty good, but the lower standard of presentation was disappointing. I miss the beautifully prepared plates and attention to detail. I am sad to have to post this review. Soho was something I was looking forward to when in town.",

    "text": "So we went in hungry and craving a variety of sushi rolls. Except we came in at 3:30pm and from 12-4pm they have a very limited lunch menu (which we didn't know about). So we were seriously on the verge of leaving, not because we were mad but because we just REALLY wanted sushi and didn't want to trouble them. But our waitress Sheila convinced us to stay and told us that she will request the Sushi chef to start the dinner menu early. We ended up getting the full dinner menu released to us about 30 minutes earlier, the service was great, and hands down the best Japanese dishes I've ever had. We ended up just getting one Specialty roll, but tried a variety of other things like: short rib plate, tuna tostada, sweet shrimp, oysters, and baked green mussels. Then the chef gave us a complimentary salmon dish with some kind of ponzu sauce and pop rocks.... soooo good! Sheila said the chef sent it out because we were being patient with them even though I felt like it was the other way around since they changed up their whole service routine for us. Needless to say, we'll be back... and we live in Henderson.",

We had the: - Hydro Bibb Black Cod (nice big chunk of cod),  - shrimp tempura,  - spicy tuna roll (good quality, not masked by a lot of hot sauce),  - fire cracker roll (inside was kind of mushy and flavors weren't distinct),  cajun albacore sashimi (awesome fish quality),  - baked mussels (LOVED the flavor. LOVED, loved, LOVED the sauce; mussels had a good texture) and  - jalapeno poppers (way bigger than I expected).   We also got the matcha tiramisu. It was DELICIOUS!! LOTS OF FLAVOR. (Unfortunately they were out of the green tea creme brulee.) The iced green tea was a little watered down (tasted like sugar cane water, couldn't really taste the tea).  I love that the happy hour portions are full sized/order. The quality is good and fresh. They don't use a ton of rice either (huge 'plus' in my book). The food came out fast and hot.  Service was reeeeally good. Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and tentative. I appreciate that she didn't treat us different or worse because we mainly ordered from the happy hour menu.  We will definitely be back and bring friends and family!!!",

For example, a california roll was listed for $7.  However upon closer inspection, I think I understand why the seemingly high price.  The roll comes with real crab, not the usual immitation stuff.  I guess Soho was going for food quality more than price.  I ordered the sashimi lunch seto for $8.50.  Again, the price was reasonable considering the quality of what I got - awesome!  I need to go back here with a group of people to sample more items on the menu.  Based on my single lunch experience so far, this place is a winner.",

    "text": "I'm going against my own rules here (writing a review not only before I've tried it twice, but before I've finished the first meal!!), but this place is... Not just ONE word to describe it! This place caught me by surprise. Here's why:  When I pulled up to the front, I thought, it's nothing special to look at, basic strip mall sushi place. I walked in and the setup is modest, almost unsure of itself. I looked at the menu and saw that there weren't MANY options, but I stayed positive. I was meeting a friend there who had been there the night before and asked me to go with her tonight again so there must be something about this place...  She arrived and we began ordering our basic favorites. For me, it's just a simple Philly roll. She warned me that if I didn't like smoked salmon, to ask for fresh. When I try somewhere new, I like to try new things but I gauge how far I'm willing to go by the predictable. \"If I don't like the smoked salmon, I'll stick to the beginner rolls\" is what went through my mind. After the first bite of \"beginner\" Philly roll, I realized, this is the big league. Beyond fresh. Strip quality. Local pricing. I. WANT. MORE.  I ordered a Firecracker roll, which sounds like it may be spicy, but Sushi Chef John Lee (the owner and head sushi chef of Soho, previously known as executive chef of Social House at Crystals CityCenter, whom I also had the honor to meet and speak with at length) knows his fish pairings. The Firecracker roll was the perfect amount of spicy, sweet, crunchy, and smooth. It found itself somewhere between amazing and incredible on my scale of taste. Best of all, though, it was $9. I immediately had doubt that I would find anything better on the menu. BOOOYYYYYYY was I in for a ride!!!  My friend ordered a Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll because she only got one piece the day prior due to her party eating it all. Ha! Needless to say, I only got one piece of that one too! So I ordered my own as well. WOW. Normally I'm hesitant about soft shell. I've had a few questionable experiences with it and I feel like I'd rather just not take the chance again but this make... \"Speechless\" is what comes to mind. Trust me on this if nothing else, TRY IT. Take one bite and you'll understand.  Aside from the sushi rolls, we also ordered Angus Beef Tataki. I've had it before at another Japanese restaurant in Vegas and LOVED it. Sushi Chef John Lee creates all his own sauces, many which use citrus as an ingredient. He paired the beef with a mild but savory sauce that can only be described as succulent. Presented beautifully like all his plates, I almost feel bad that I destroyed it. :D  We ordered several more dishes (WAYYY too many to describe right now) and they're all borderline orgasmic. I toughed it through to manage a dessert as well due to a picture I saw on yelp of a Green Tea Tiramisu. Being part Italian and having lived in Italy for 4 years, I can judge harshly on any food claiming to be \"Italian\" or using \"Italian ingredients or methods\"... I'll say it fast... Italy should take note... This dessert was shocking. Green Tea.... Tiramisu.... It's a combination that could rival the tastebud tickling that Jose Andres has done at China Poblano at The Cosmopolitan. Not bashing him at all, I find him to be an incredible magician of food, but this sole dessert is something else. Something intriguing. Now only to avoid the mafia from here on out...  Just prior to leaving (we had stayed a measly 2.5 hours... NBD...), Sushi Chef John Lee asked how everything had been for us, to which we applauded and both agreed to write 5 star reviews. Then he said, \"Thank you, but all I want is for you to leave happy, having enjoyed the food that I can make for you.\" So I replied, \"Well, I'm leaving sad.... But it's only because I have to leave.\" He laughed and thanked us again and we departed.  Lastly, thank you Bobbi for taking me here! And if you'd like to \"duke\" it out for that crown, I'm all yours baby! ;)",

Food is always consistently on point. Sushi places often struggle to keep their standards to a level. This place, without being over-pricey, keep a high level of quality while giving you good quantity.   #2. The service here is great! Glass half full? Now it's full again. Bam, new prospective. But seriously, they make sure you are well catered too and even at times surprise you with unexpected sample dishes from the kitchen which is always a good hook. (ho ho ho...get it? Hook? Sushi restaurant? Ehhh...I should stop while I'm ahead)  #3. Place is clean. Even the bathroom. You can tell a lot about the hygiene level of the wait staff and kitchen crew of a restaurant by its restrooms. No lie. Go to a McDonald's bathroom then go to a great restaurant bathroom and you'll know what I mean.   #4. Green Tea Tiramisu. Enough said.",

They really have a punchy flavor and it never fails to satisfy. I do admit sometimes I am disappointed that they don't have more types of sushi rolls on the menu, but they make that up for how amazing their sushi tastes. At the same time, I like how simple their menu is because it is not overwhelming like other places. It makes ordering go by quicker. Service is good as well. Sometimes I like sitting at the sushi bar because I get my food wayyyyy faster.  The mochi here is also really great as well. When you order mochi, it comes in 3 and you can choose from mango, strawberry, green tea, and black sesame.  The interior of the place is really upgraded! I noticed that they changed their chairs to these fancy brown executive looking chairs (much comfier too). The ambiance of the place is very calming and romantic. They have fake candles on each table and some dim colored lights along the walls. I also like that they frosted the bottom windows so that if a car pulls up in front of the place with their lights on, it doesn't shine bright through the place. That way the customer doesn't get bright lights shined in their face while their eating. They pay attention to a lot of detail here.   Food, cleanliness, and customer service is rated 10/10 in my books!  This place is always packed too since it's so good, so plan to go before rush hour/dinner time or be prepared to wait a little. The wait is very much worth it.",

    "text": "WOW! I cannot tell you enough how much I love Soho!    I have been searching for some new great spots on the southwest side of town and sadly, there aren't many. So naturally, when I read that former Executive chef of Social House (John Chien Lee) opened his own restaurant, I was thrilled!!   I have always loved Social House but think their prices are outrageous for the portion sizes you get. The Sashimi Sampler at S.H. was my favorite but the fish was cut so thin and skimpy and was $28!  BUUUUUTTTT not at Soho! The Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer was only $10 and the yellowtail was cut THICK and was out-of-this-world delicious!!  DO NOT miss! I repeat: DO NOT MISS!! (I wanted to order 10!!!) We also ordered a simpl spicy tuna roll off the Happy Hour Menu and 6 Poke \"Tostadas\". All very very delicious and very inexpensive!!!!  The rolls were A-MAZING! We tried the Dragon Twin, Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll, the Sunny Salmon Roll and goodness.....the quality of the fish is SO FRESH! I have to admit, its been a long time since i've had such fresh fish in Las Vegas. Oyishi is usually my local hang, and though I love it... I feel as of late, the quality of fish has really gone downhill at points and its totally bummed me out! (That's why I've been on the search for a new spot!)   One nice touch is that they also offer a hot brown rice Japanese tea and its complimentary, which is a nice alternative to the traditional green tea and its really really yummy!  To top off the whole experience, Chef Lee came out and asked us how our dinner was! He was so kind and actually mentioned that he takes the freshness of his seafood very seriously! To which I replied... \"It's the first thing I noticed!\" followed by... \"I'm your biggest fan and telling everyone I know!!\"  Without a doubt this is going to be my new spot. I want to eat here every night of the week! Ohhhhh, I'm drooling just thinking about it.....",

This is not an AYCE restaurant but they do have amazing sushi rolls. I love the Fire Cracker Roll, the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, and let's not forget the Sashimi Mix plate of 15 pcs of fresh fish for just $25 (have you've seen how he cuts his sashimi pieces? It's much thicker than most places I go to). I normally wait to sit at the bar just to see Chef John in action. His friendly warm welcoming personality definitely brings more flavor to his dishes and there's never a quiet dull moment. We leave with a night filled with great food, great drinks and laughs with the chef/owner John   Sheila is one of their many amazing servers...",

    "text": "Damn! I don't know how better to start off this review. Just had dinner there tonight for the first time after wanting to try a new place and reading the yelp reviews. I am so happy I went and tried this place. When I first walked in, we were greeted by the friendly staff. We sat at the bar and the gentleman asked us for our drink order. Being a big fan of beers my attention was quickly drawn to the cooler. I noticed they had some unique craft beers that I've never seen before (which is a surprise in a sushi restaurant anyways), but i was sold on a Japanese beer that I've never before (great beer by the way, forgot the name but has a white label, almost looks like a sake bottle) and a craft of lychee sake, which had to been some of the best I've had!  The the gentleman went on to explain some of the popular items on the menu, such as the sashimi, rolls, short rib,etc.     After we ordered a couple of recommendations we met the owner John as well as some of his other chefs. Do yourself a HUGE favor when you go, put the menu away when you look at it and let John and his crew hook you up!!! I can't describe how epic the dishes where they were creating for us. And don't worry, prices here are VERY reasonable!!! We ate a ton, majority off the menu with lots of booze and our bill was about $100. The short rib is an absolute must and hands down the best on the planet. They braise it for 8 hours and glaze it in a homemade veal  stock. The fish is so fresh, no cloudiness or weird texture. Just really amazing and everything is made in the restaurants from sauces to deserts.   I can go on and on about Soho but you have to go. I went based on a yelp review and I'm so glad I did. Hopefully you'll have an opportunity to experience this culinary marvel as well!!!  Happy Eatings!!!",

If you are looking for all you can eat or 50 different rolls and nigiri then this place is not for you. if you are looking for a great atmosphere, fantastic service, and unbelievable flavor, then Soho is for you. the menu is awesome. they had a nice selection of a variety of things. Some cold apps, including sashimi are a good way to start. they have these $2 cold fish on chips which were really good. they had a nice variety of hot apps which we did not partake in. One of the best cucumber salads I have ever had.   we had several rolls. I would highly recommend the crispy tuna. it isn't quite as good as Katsuya's but it was outstanding. also had a twin dragon which we really liked.   total for 4 was $100. we wanted to try a lot of things and we ate it all. this place is so good. our kids (ages 4 to 14) love sushi restaurants. they are well behaved but I probably wouldn't bring them here. maybe one or two but not all five. Soho could certainly accommodate all of us, I just think it was a great friends or date place.   well done Soho.  well done.",

The different kind of fish in our sashimi platter tasted really fresh. This is definitely a 5 star in spite of the wait (to be seated and bringing out the food).  Everything was worth the wait.

Chefs, thank you so much for making my trip to vegas worth it!   I've never liked sashimi before but my taste has changed after eating here. Had the white fish ponzu, salmon wasabi creme,  yellowtail yuzu, and the yellowtail soho tadas. Everything tastes sooooo fresh and the sauces were well-paired. Items were beautifully presented. Tadas are $2 each and the sashimi specialties I had were $11/$12. Worth every penny.   Hot sake was served in a roundish bottle so the heat stayed in longer than the tall long ones usually served at other restaurants.   My friends had the sushi lunch special with some spicy tuna rolls. They were happy with their choice as well.   Desserts: also delicious we're matcha tiramisu and GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE!!!!   p.s. I couldn't even wait to get home to make a review.",

My significant other and I came to Soho on Memorial Day (yes, they are open). It is 15 minutes off the Strip. We ordered from the Lunch menu. They have pretty good deals for their lunch specials. I ordered sashimi lunch special and it came with soup, salad and good portion of sashimi for about $10 and the sashimi was fresh. The yellow tail appetizer was very good as well.   I wished I had the stomach space to try more, but I guess it just mean another visit to Soho in the near future.",

Happy Hour is from Mon-Sat 4pm-6pm. The HH menu is pretty damn impressive. Prices range from $1-$5. Regular menu prices aren't too bad either. Today I only experienced the HH menu and I couldn't get enough of it.  Infused Cold Sake ($4)- you can choose from Lycee or White Peach Flavored. I went with the Lycee. It was sweet and comes with about 4 shots. When the workers would see your shot glass empty they would fill it for you, which I thought was pretty cool.  Tostadas ($1)- you can choose from Salmon, Tako, Tuna, and Hamachi. These are probably my favorite thing on the menu. I had to order more than one. I couldn't choose which one was my favorite. They're all my favorite!   Spicy Tuna Roll ($4)- Only item that didn't really stand out. Very plain.  Fire cracker roll ($5)- has spicy tuna with jalapenos, cream cheese, sweet onion & is deep fried! MUST HAVE! It's literally heaven in your mouth.   Salmon Avocado Roll ($4)- the amount of fish and avocado overpowers the rice which is appreciates. I love when the rice/fish ratio favors the fish!   Cajun Albacore Sashimi ($5)- the beau's favorite! Had to order more than one. The aioli sauce that it's swimming in is so delicious and the fish is so fresh.  Jalapeno Poppers ($3)- BOMB!   The owner of the restaurant was kind enough to come say hello to us and see how we liked the food. He even gave us complementary Yellowtail Sashimi which is one of their specialities. Our server, Sheila, was the greatest. Very helpful with the menu and extremely nice. She told us that they just opened 6 months ago and have been extremely busy due to the Yelp community. How amazing is yelp!  We definitely will be returning!",

Though they're not conveniently located on the strip and the ambiance isn't as swanky, the prices are much lower and the portions are bigger.  I chose to have an omakase here on my birthday. The wait was a bit long. They have a fusion take on sushi, with many of the dishes infused with ponzu sauce and other non-traditional accompaniments. The price was very reasonable. Significantly less than my last omakase in San Franacisco. Better yet, you could to get an omakase a requested price. We skipped the cooked dishes and requested sushi only. The chefs were very accommodating and polite. Let them know what you're favorites are! There was some waiting time each dish, as the chefs were fulfilling orders and juggling our customized dishes. Understandable.   The place has a great local vibe..none of those pretentious people.",

Just skim the reviews for HH and you'll see tons of rave reviews.  The value is incredible for the quality they are putting out!  This is seen again in their Lunch Specials.  Even void of the HH/Lunch pricing, they are still creating some wonderfully balanced and fairly inspired dishes though.    I always check out the specials board when entering Soho as some of my favorite dishes have come from there.  Their signature dish is a Yellowtail Sashimi that comes with  a slice of Tempura Jalapeno, some Micro Cilantro, and is finished with Garlic Oil & Yuzu Soy.  It has quickly become a Soho classic and elevates the Yellowtail without distracting from the fish.  In fact their have been multiple moments that my tongue has longed...yearned...I don't know...maybe lusted for a little tempura jalapeno slice.  This can sometimes be awkward when it happens during the day and excessive amounts of salivation is accompanied.  It can be easily avoided with fairly regular visits however.  I am also a fan of their Tostadas...they make for a well composed bite (or two) and come in multiple offerings.  Their are plenty of other tasty options including Hydro Bibb Black Cod, Blue Fin Tuna Specials, and Ocean Trout Specials.  The later two of which also work well simply as Nigiri.",

Their Miso soup is undeniably the best Miso soup I have had in town.       Service was awesome and I hear their happy hour is great as well, will have to make it to that soon.

    "text": "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(109/365) \"From Social House to the Suburbs\"  Chef John Chien Lee has set up shop on the Southwest side of town and is fast becoming a favorite spot among the Yelp Community and you can see by the rave reviews!  Our few visits have been during happy hour, and this is one of the best HH spots around town IMHO. On our first visit, we tried the Soho Maki, Tostadas(All 4 kinds), Beef Tataki, Albacore Sashimi, Firecracker Roll, Ika Geso,  Cod Lettuce Wraps, and all were delicious with the exception of the Soho Maki which is essentially annorexic spring rolls in a glass. That item as well as the Firecracker Roll was forgettable.  Our Second visit, we arrived just before HH which allowed us to try one of their lunch specials. If I had to suggest one, The Soho Moco where Chef Chien pays homage to the Hawaiian Loco Moco is pretty bangin'!  A nicely seasoned burger patty with rice, a perfectly fried egg, and Chien's version of a gravy comes with a side salad and miso soup...All that for $8.95? Stupid, right!?!? Oh, the components are presented seperately in a nice bento box style, but to totaly enjoy the Moco, dump out the rice and make little bed, on goes the burger, on the burger goes the egg, then smother the whole thing with the gravy. Cut in to that bad boy letting the yolk ooze all over, and KILL IT!...;9  We also redeemed ourselves during dessert as we finally got our hands on their popular Green Tea Tiramisu (They ran out during our first visit) That was a great ending to our meal.  The service here is some of the best as well. Servers are very personable, and are quick to offer recommendations of popular items as well as their personal favorites Chef Chien himself even stops by to each table to see how everyone's doing and even lets you know of upcoming events and menu additions which I thought were pretty cool. Soho is closed on Sundays so that Chef Chien and his employees have quality time with family...Awesome boss points right there! If you haven't already, come by and have yourself some Soho action!

I read the review from a fellow yelper that recommended some Sashimi plates and I tried them all and it was incredible.  Wasabi creme Salmon, Seared Tuna, Ocean Trout and Yellowtail with Crispy Jalapeno slices.  All fantastic!  The Black Cod appetizer was the perfect start to this meal.  Perfect for kids too- they offer chicken with rice.   The service was quick and attentive the food outstanding.  This place is not on the Strip and though if you're in Vegas it's where you want to be, but with this kind of rating I had to check this place out.

She had never eaten sushi and  wanted to try it so we went there because it is close and had good reviews on Yelp.  The staff greeted us immediately and were very friendly.  Our waiter was great at helping us make our selections and the Chef came out to visit with my daughter personally.  They brought her up to the counter and let her watch as he made a special roll just for her.  The food was excellent but the staff, environment and Chef provided an experience my daughter and I will never forget.  I will definitely be back.",

Notable were the tosadas.  The ahi one especially.  These folks do fresh fish right!  It's not chewy or tastless like some AYCE places.  The wait staff are also very observant and friendly.  We will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Let me break down the five stars. Service was excellent. Incredibly attentive without being in the way. They seemed genuinely interested and excited to give recommendations and menu ideas.  The food -  part one - sushi and traditional rolls. We ordered several types of sushi (mostly standards plus the chef gave us blue fin tuna). All were fresh, well presented, large portions. The excellent quality of the fish was confirmed as we ate our way through the platter. If I had to nitpick, the rice could have been more firmly packed under the fish, but that really is splitting hairs.   I also ordered (a few) salmon skin rolls. I try to order this particular dish whenever I go to a new sushi house. I think it's a very difficult item to make well. In short, they did just that. The salmon skin was perfectly crisped, the roll was compact and filled with fresh garnish, including avocado and a light sauce that, though I can't put my finger on the exact flavor, moved the roll from good to fantastic.  Part two - The specialty rolls. We ordered several specialty rolls. One, the twin dragon was as delicious as it was big. It was the last thing we ate and capped the meal with a perfect sweetness.  We also ordered the crispy rice spicy tuna roll. In truth, that was the only downer of the meal. The spicy tuna topping was perfectly blended and flavorful, but the rice was severely overcooked.  That, however, was the sole flaw in our dinner.  When we received the bill, we were more than pleasantly surprised that our sushi extravaganza had cost about 40% of what we'd typically spend at sushi Roku and a quarter of nobu.  Whether our meal was as good as at either Roku or nobu is debatable, it probably wasn't. However, the meal was excellent, the sushi was fresh and well presented, and the staff were wonderful. Given that, it will be hard to justify going to either of the aforementioned restaurants instead of soho. The price for marginally better food  simply does not seem worth it.",

So, we took to yelp and (as per usual) we weren't disappointed. From the minute you walk in, the quality of the establishment oozes from every corner.   The prices were incredible for the quality you get, and the selection was broad - encompassing more than just sushi, but also several styles of Japanese cuisine. I will admit, we ordered Gyazo but were unsuccessful as they were currently out. We instead ordered the Edimame as an appetizer and before we could come close to finishing it, were presented with our first 2 rolls. We continued to pack in as much of the delectable assortment as we could and threw in the towel after 5 rolls. This is a testament to the value itself as we're both avid sushi eaters.  We settled up the check and called for a cab. However, as there were 2 conventions running, we were told it could take up to 2 hours! Feeling defeated we walked back in and asked the staff if there was a better cab company to call -- they were met with the same response.  What happened next shocked me most. The owner actually allowed one of the staff to drive us back in to the strip! I was floored. The cab ride back was a 20 minute trip with the traffic and they were absolutely great about it! I couldn't ask for more in terms of customer service.  Thanks Soho for reminding me that some places still care!",

Got the yellowtail and a fresh Alaskan salmon order.  Yellowtail ponzu sauce was amazing, went to my happy place.   Salmon special came with greens and kelp noodles, my favorite.    Twin Dragon roll - beyond good.  I don't know which part of it I enjoyed the most.    Finished with the short rib, one of the best I've ever had, anywhere. Fall off the bone, perfectly seasoned.  Side salad was even good, had a nice kick to it. Delicious.    Best sushi experience I've had in years.  Highly recommend. .",

The owner came around and introduced himself, I had met him before, he is super friendly. It always nice to see this, shows he cares. Oddly enough, the credit card machine wasn't working, the waiter said they would run the amount later if that was ok. I was ok with that especially when they have my 20% off the total bill.",

We started with the yellowtail, salmon and scallop sashimi. All were wonderfully seasoned, but my absolute favorite was the melt in your mouth yellowtail and salmon. Sushi that we chose were the Spicy soft shell crab and the Twin Dragon, both delicious. The main entrees we ordered were the jidori chicken, miso cod and the short rib. I have to say all were fantastic as well, but the short rib... OMG!! The service was superb and we were able to meet Chef and owner who was the executive chef at Social House in Crystals. We were also surprised with the beef tataki compliments of the Chef. Simply amazing dinner and restaurant. On top of that, the live music was very entertaining. We'll definitely be back and what's great is it's just down the street from where we live :)",

I have to be open and honest here: I know the owner and some of the staff, yet had NO idea this place was even opening, as well as opening so close to where I live in SW Vegas...  From first hand working experience on the strip, I can say Soho has derived itself from the benchmarks of service and food quality set by elite Vegas fine dining, but at a third of the price. Real king crab in your California roll, big-chunk big-eye tuna in your spicy tuna rolls, countless specialty rolls, lunch specials, Locomoco holy sh*t...   This is the best sushi off the strip hands down. I need to mention  the ONLY reason I got into eating sushi as much as I have in the past few years is because I got to try SOHO owner John Lee's sushi years ago, from a popular Vegas restaurant on the strip. Now I can walk there in 5 min, get the same food, and at a great price. DONE.",

    "text": "My initial experience at Soho when it first opened was not very pleasant. The food was good but the service was a total mess.   I decided to come back and give it another shot last Saturday night.  The restaurant was busy but we were able to get a table right away. I noticed that the servers were more attentive and accurate this time around. The server took our beverage order immediately and followed up in a couple of minutes for the food order.   We ordered the following dishes:  Hamachi Yuzu Soy (5/5) - I liked how he used a Serrano pepper rather than jalapeno. Also, the Serrano pepper was deep fried. Something different. The fish was very fresh.   Mixed Tempura (3/5) - I have mixed feelings about this dish. The batter was not what I was expecting. It was not crispy and light. For me, one of the gauges for a good Japanese restaurant is the tempura since it's one of the least complicated dishes to make. One good thing they did with it was to add some salt after frying it.   Toban Soup (3/5) - Basically it's a soup made out of dashi and mushrooms. Nothing special just the presentation. It was served to us in a tea pot with tiny tea cups. This soup needs a little revamp.   Sunny Roll - seared salmon, spicy crab, lemon and tempura asparagus (4/5) the roll was good, fresh ingredients but for me it tasted ordinary. Nothing that made my palette jump for excitement.   Hamachi Poke (4/5) - this was a new dish that the owner is trying out. It had onions in it but surprisingly, for you onion haters like me, you can hardly taste the onion. The fish was fresh and the flavor was good.   Chocolate Mousse Cake (6/5) - this was the highlight dish of the night. So far, Soho is consistent with its desserts... Always the perfect ending to a meal.   Let's go back to the service. I want to emphasize that the owner did a great job improving the service of the restaurant. I must say all the servers were very helpful and sober (compared to my last visit).  I had my drink refilled several times and the owner stopped by our table 3x to check on the food.   I will definitely be back. Hopefully the owner has a new addition to his menu that will make my palette jump for joy that I can give this restaurant a 5-star rating.",

My gf and I have been planning to try this place out for awhile now and we're glad we finally did. If you go here, you definitely have to order: the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, King Crab Tempura, and Snapper with Uni. The king crab tempura is hella legit, and it comes with this delicious sauce. The snapper with Uni is definitely A MUST, probably the best thing on the menu for me. I've had bad experiences with uni before, but after hearing people tell me fresh uni is actually \"sweet\", I just had to give it a try. THAT UNI WAS SWEET AF. The service was amazing as well, our server Candice was on top of it. She explained the menu thoroughly and was really helpful since it was our first time. Basically, you should go here if you haven't already (:",

Some of the highest quality fish I have ever had, incredibly creative rolls, and highly accommodating to restrictive diets (I am gluten-free).  First, our server Casey, was extremely observant in identifying that I had asked our drink person for gluten free soy sauce when we were seated and let me know he was more than happy to accommodate.  Then the chefs were great in meeting those needs!  For example, I ordered a roll that is normally deep fried but that does not work with a gluten free diet.  They were willing to skip the frying for me but warned me it probably wouldn't taste the same.  I was so surprised when they brought me the roll to find they had rolled it in gluten free rice cake instead since I couldn't have the tempura fry!  It was so creative and thoughtful to give me as much of the original flavor as possible.  I felt that I was truly valued as an individual!    Soho, you have earned a customer for life.  And since I come to Vegas every year for a sports tournament, that will be for a long time.  Oh, and check out the pickled wasabi (REAL wasabi!).  Delicious!",

Unfortunately Soho is around the corner from where I live and the first time I went there was when I was exhausted from working 12-hours straight. They were also almost closed as it was late.   I was so tired that I just told my waitress Mika to give me anything. I received a cooked Hamachi shoulder part I believe for a mere under $20. Oh Boy! the taste and flavor was out of this world and I just realized I have not even tried any sushi yet.  Next trip I came in during happy hour on a weekday and though it's not even 5pm yet. Had to wait 10-minutes and decided to just eat by the counter. My big mistake was I didn't eat breakfast, nor lunch today as I was over working again. We ordered everything on the happy hour menu and not a single one disappointed. I asked the sushi chef what was good and affordable. He made us a sashimi platter to die for but unfortunately I was too hungry that I forgot to take a picture!  I have to be fair and do another review and take pictures to be able to describe each item we consume and talk about the uniqueness of the dishes.",

Ingredients are always incredibly fresh, and dishes range from traditional to inventive and creative twists on traditional items.  If it's your first time you should try a few tostadas, the black cod in butter lettuce, anything they have with uni if you enjoy it (they pride themselves on their selection and freshness).  Their sashimi combinations always executed expectations. Front their traditional assortments to their contemporary interpretations.  Have fun when you go here, definitely try some of their specials of the day, but not matter what, given their superior quality and friendly and inviting ambiance and service, you're bound to have a great time!",

Put this place on your bucket list if you haven't already done so, you surely won't be disappointed. A near perfect rating on yelp explains a lot about Soho, and I'm glad I found this little gem hidden around the corner of my house.   I came in here for my girlfriends birthday, they were very accommodating and friendly even storing and plating some cupcakes I brought in from The Cupcakery. The service here is amazing and something you would expect dining on the strip paying top dollar. Chef John brought many practices from Social House but with a more relaxed vibe. He came out and introduced his self and got a feel for everyone and put together a epic tasting menu for the whole group.(If you have the chance choose this way to dine) I couldn't have set up a better menu in my wildest dreams. From the tender short ribs to the delicate hamachi and uni, everything amazing and leaving you wanting more and more. I have to say I never had the quality of uni Chef Lee serves and he prides himself in the quality of his foods.   I am so satisfied with the quality of food and service with Soho that I will be back time and time again. You can't beat this place, he deserves all the recognition they can get for this gem! Thank you for the great experience!",

The Kumamoto oysters were very fairly priced ($3 each!) and yummy as they should be. The service was great - attentive but not overbearing.  And that braised short rib... definitely drool-worthy.  Really really good.  For take-out, we ordered 4 of their lunch specials: salmon teriyaki, steak teriyaki, Soho loco and tonkatsu (each lunch special was under $9!). The steak teriyaki was definitely one of the best. Typically, the meat most restaurants use for the steak teriyaki tend to be tough/chewy/stringy, but Soho's was great. Could have cut through it with a spoon. My husband had the tonkatsu, which came with a curry sauce and he ate it, even though he's not normally a fan of curry. The Soho loco was.. different. Instead of brown gravy, it came with a unique sauce. But the meat, like the steak teriyaki, was very good. Soho House will definitely remain a place-to-go when we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "What in the world! One of the best sushi experiences I have ever had. Why? Of course amazing quality but also a server who worked wonders with us.  First of all, we wanted to sample a variety of fish so we ordered like 5 types of sashimi. I usually steer clear from the pre-selected plates since I want to have control. However, our server Sheila said there was a large plate for much cheaper and basically she would get us what we wanted. Vegas baby!  So, we got some salmon, scallop, albacore, yellowtail and regular tuna. All outstanding. FYI if you have never had sashimi scallop, it's a must try. If it sucks then it's not fresh enough. This one was pretty good. These are large pieces too, nothing wimpy. Soy sauce was good. Ginger was fresh. Wasabi packed a lot of heat.  Then we got a handful of rolls--spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, twin dragon ... and did we get the firecracker too? Anyway, again all excellent.  A bottle of sake later, we decided to hit the uni. My friend and I have had limited and bad experiences with uni, either bad quality or tried so long ago just bad memories. Our server convinced us their quality was outstanding so we got some Catalina ones and she had them throw in some Hokkaido ones as well since we had trouble making up our minds. Wow! Ridiculously good--buttery, silky, no fishy or slimy nastiness.  As if that wasn't enough, we kept talking about coming back during this trip and she said we would have to try the wagyu if we do. We ask if they just have it for dinner? Nope, lunch too. Since we could die before the next time out, we decide to go ahead and get it now. Vegas baby! And as if we were not winning enough, $25 for 2 oz of rare Kagoshima prefecture wagyu. Wuuuut? I mean this is a steal!!! Makes up for the money I lost gambling. In most restaurants you are talking about $25-35 per ounce of this delicacy. Needless to say, it was outstanding. It was served with some sauces and salt, etc on the side.  I tell ya. We probably ate $400 worth but it was way below that. The service was awesome, friendly and the ambience was nice for a little strip mall joint. We are definitely going back on the next trip out. My friend's high roller friend says it's the best in Vegas. If you are in the mood for sushi, you cannot miss this place.",

    "text": "Vegas has so many world renowned chefs with outposts on the Strip that surprisingly, the best sushi in the city might be found off it. Pretty hard for me to believe myself.   As my friends were spending their money on $35 drinks at a pool/day club on a Saturday afternoon after paying $40 for their ticket to see Alesso, I opted to find a good place to eat by myself. I polled friends on Facebook and got great recommendations like Raku, Sweets Raku, Piero's, L'Atelier by Robuchon, Taste of Siam (I had already been there before), but some of them weren't open for lunch.  I found Soho Restaurant on Yelp, then found that it was also listed as #3 in Yelp blog's top 100 places in the US for 2015.    I took a seat at the sushi bar. A server and one of the sushi chefs asked what I liked eating. I started with a couple of sashimi plates, added a roll, then finished with live sweet shrimp.  This nerd was really enjoying watching them at work then I spotted that they had uni. The chef asked if I liked sea urchin and explained that they always tried to carry two varieties. I'm savoring my sashimi and a couple of minutes later, the chef places a small plate before me. \"Since you like uni, here's some uni with snapper for you to try!\"   As I was finishing up my sashimi plates and about to start on my roll, the chef places another small plate in front of me.  Chef: Do you like beef? Do you eat meat?  Me: Yes, of course, I love beef!  Chef: Ok, good! This is just a little bit of our Wagyu.  I didn't realize what I was eating until I bit in. WAGYU A5! Who gives away Wagyu A5? It was so tender, so fat, so juicy with just a magic dust sprinkle of sea salt. He had just finished prepping some beef dishes and there was an ounce or two left over so I benefited.   Eventually I finished my roll. I was about full, but was able to squeeze in live sweet shrimp for my last dish, a perfect way to finish it off.   Yellowtail Yuzu Soy (w/ Tempura Serrano, Micro Cilantro, Garlic Oil, Ponzu, Garlic Dust) - You can't go wrong with any of their sashimi dishes here, but the Yellowtail Yuzu made my mouth feel like a kid at Disneyland. Happy, alive, and full of wonderment. Fresh fish with a citrusy, yuzu ponzu, topped with a deep fried serrano pepper slice. Very tender, crisp, and clean. The tempura serrano made this next level. This was my favorite of the dishes I tried.   Golden Ocean Trout (w/ Freeze Dried Miso, Chives, Lemon Ponzu, Pop Rocks) - Barely a half-step behind the Yellowtail Yuzu is the Ocean Trout. A bright orange trout (almost looks like salmon), it was an evenly marbled cut that made it slightly buttery. The lemon ponzu and sweet crackling pop rocks was a contrast that complimented everything well. Based on personal preference, you might like this better than the yellowtail. Both are phenomenal.  Santa Barbara Uni with Snapper - My sample plate of this was the same as the regular sashimi dish. The snapper is subtle with allows the fresh, rich uni to shine.  Twin Dragon Dragon Roll (Alaskan King Crab, Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Tempura Shrimp) -  Yes, real Alaskan King Crab. Avocado chunks. All of this good stuff, topped with roe and drizzled with sauce. Loved it.    Wagyu A5 - Best way to describe this dish is to say... Wagyu A5. If you don't know what that means, well, that means baby soft well marbled beef that just melts in your mouth. The way they cooked it was perfect... A simple preparation, medium rare with just a touch of sea salt, allowing nothing to distract me from a gorgeous piece of meat.   Live Sweet Shrimp (Amaebi) - For my shrimp they used a large, live shrimp, so I'm not sure that it's True amaebi. Smaller amebi that I've had in the past have been sweeter. The single shrimp was prepped three ways for me. They removed the head shell, then cut the head from the body, and then plated the body and while the head was split, half deep fried while the other half was cooked in a miso soup. There is something very pure and primitive about eating something raw minutes after it was alive. Yes, we are a sick peoples, but it's so good.   Have you ever been to a restaurant for the first time and they give you uni and Wagyu on the house? I'm still in awe. Thanks to John, the sushi chef who helped point me in the right direction and created phenomenal dishes. He was the one that noticed that I was really enjoying my food and gave me more just for the heck of it. I didn't know he was the owner! If you see a guy behind the sushi bar cutting jokes with his staff while making sure the fish aren't alive, that's John.   Only $48 (before tax and tip) for all of this? If I didn't order the last shrimp, it would have only been $38. This same meal would easily cost you double on the Strip. And they have Happy Hour deals too. Only ten minutes/five miles from the Strip, Soho Restaurant is worth the small detour to have some of the best sushi in the city!",

Let Sheila take control of the menu and you will be amazed and surprised with every plate she brings you. This is a True gem in the gastro world.   I hear they are opening a new restaurant on Sahara named Sushi Burrito. Must try this one next.    Came back as I was in Las Vegas for a convention. This is a must stop for me.   Oscar & Charlie guided us through the menu. The Escolar Carpaccio, firecracker roll, bronze broccoli & bakes mussels are excellent and available on the happy hour menu.   As I said before the best way to experience this restaurant is to tell the server how much you want to spend and let them take control. This lets them cut loose and be creative. You will be truly amazed by what Tai', Oscar and the team will create for you.   All I can say is let go and let them amaze you.",

They wanted us to try the yellow tail sashimi.  It had tempura jalapeno slices on top, micro greens, and some awesome sauce.  Then we go the SOHO tatas, white fish, salmon, and shrimp.  Garlic edamame, calamari with three sauces, short rib in a wasabi cream sauce and salad in this spicy dressing.  This was like home cooked comfort food.  Everything is presented beautifully, every bite melts in your mouth.  We ordered the green tea creme brulee but they brought out the matcha tiramisu, and when they realized it they brought out the creme brulee. lol  We liked the creme brulee more because we don't care for the soggy texture but the flavor was good.    I came back another time with a friend after spending all day outside for a festival.  It was hot and we wanted cold food, so we came for iced green tea, sashimi, and a spicy tuna roll.  It was a nice refreshing post event meal before napping and getting ready for the night. I'm so glad this place is here.",

    "text": "Soho was my first place I visited while visiting Las Vegas. I came here on the on set of happy hour and we ordered a variety of items including, the Cajun Albacore Sashimi, Salmon Roll, Black Cod Butter Lettuce Wraps, Spicy Tuna Roll, Fried Calamari, and Kurobuta Sausages wrapped in Bacon. All items were between $3 and $5 during happy house, not to mention the $4 ice cold draft of Sapporo.   Both rolls, where great. The spicy tuna had a nice kick and tasted good, and the salmon roll's salmon was very good, rich in flavor and with a good amount of fat. The avocado pieces were perfectly ripe and creamy. The Albacore Sashimi was very good and the Cajun rub brought on some unique flavors. The Albacore was mild in flavor and the garnish of thinly sliced jalapenos went a long way. I liked the sauce underneath, but I wish they would serve it on the side, because it was a little heavy handed.   The fried calamari was lightly breaded, thick, and tender. It also looked very appetizing with light honey color, but its sweet flavor was king and soft tenderness just right. The Kurobuta Sausages were bliss and were the perfect appetizer to eat with the cold Sapporo. The sausages were crispy, exploding with juice once bitten, and packed with a great meaty flavor. The crisp and chewy bacon just added to the goodness via its flavor and texture.  The Black Cod lettuce cups were pretty good. I expected a little more flavor from the cod, but it was good. The fish was light and flaky, but the cups needed some kind of sauce drizzled on top to moisten them up.   Service was great and provided by a great young lady named Candice. We were lucky to have her with a enamoring personality and friendliness. No doubt, this was a great start to my Vegas visit.",

    "text": "Take me to the place I love, take me all the way.   Exceptional service and great food that will blow your mind, located on Southwest of Vegas. We came here on a Wednesday night after seeing some great reviews on Yelp and this restaurant had exceeded my expectation.   Things we tried:  Golden ocean trout- Ordered based on server's recommendation off of appetizer and this was my most favorite dish out of everything I tried. It was ocean trout cut up sashimi style with ponzu and pop rocks drizzed on top. Yes, pop rocks. It added to an interesting sensation that kept me wanting a bite after another. Refreshing and interesting appetizer that I would highly recommend for everyone to try.   Toro/otoro- It was off of their menu board by the entrance. You can order this in either nigiri or sashimi style. We ordered this in nigiri style and it came with gold flakes on top. Thick cut of toro/otoro with just enough rice. Simply delightful dish and easily one of my favorite.   Tuna lover roll- One of their specialty rolls that comes with crispy kanikama, avocado, passion fruit soy and roasted spicy aioli. It was on the spicier side with their spicy aioli sauce that tasted like sriracha. It wasn't mind blowing but still was good and filling. Based on other reviews/photos on Yelp, seems like the firecracker roll is a popular choice for specialty roll.   Crispy brussel sprouts- I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts in general but this was fried very crispy and cut up in small pieces which makes for a great appetizer to share in groups. Just a \"ok\" for me.   Hydro bibb sea bass- miso-marinated sea bass served in lettuce cup. I'm usually not a fan of lettuce cup just because it's usually messy to eat but this was different. I ate it like it was a taco...haha. Sea bass is marinated and cooked well. One of my favorite dish.   Great restaurant for quality Japanese food. First time here and I can see myself coming back here again and again.",

The chef is super nice and always comes by and says hello.   Fast forward to today. I met Chef Nunu. I think that's his name. Him and the other guys in the back were all cool. I have to say A+++++ for great customer service. Even the ladies are super nice and they remember everyone. Well maybe cause I'm there all the time LOL   Today I decided to do something different and not order from the happy hour menu. I got the deluxe sashimi, ikura, chef special and green tea brulee.  The deluxe sashimi had salmon, sea trout, tuna, scallops, and some other fishes. They have different types of fish every week. Well that's what the chef said. I'll sit at the bar next week and see what they have. Everything on my plate was delicious. Portions are huge too. I was full after I ate all my sashimi but still had a little bit of room LOL  The next thing I got was ikura aka salmon roe. It was like eating Nemo's brothers and sisters LOL the ikura is so good here. It has a sweet taste to it.  The last fish was salmon. I think they said it was Scotland salmon. It tasted buttery and super good. They topped it with ponzu sauce, avocado and hibiscus sugar. I thought combo was weird but it melted in my mouth. It was HELLA good. It's supposed to be on the new menu.  The green tea brulee was better than the vanilla. You have to try it to believe it.  I love coming here and I will be back for more FOSHO",

It also comes along with a bowl of rice, which I was totally NOT impressed with...Dried and cakey on top, i couldn't really dig my chopsticks into it so I just ended up leaving it be. It looked like something had been sitting on top of it and squashed it down. Blech.  The rolls are really tasty though, like the Spicy SSC (yummm!). The sashimi plates are also all great and very unique, such as the one with uni. Our group had quite a bit so I can't remember all of them, but do check my pictures :)   Lastly, we actually stayed til Happy Hour to try their popular items, and if you like black cod, then you will definitely like the Happy Hour black cod lettuce cup thing. Melts in your mouth and has great flavor! The TADAS!!! (Love that name) were my favorites though--my group favored the hamachi one the most.  Needless to say, amidst all the popular AYCE restaurants in the area, Soho can definitely hold their ground!",

Attentive, prompt, and I made a passing remark about a fish (escolar) I'd previously had a not so good experience with. The server, Boris, comped us their signature escolar sashimi to leave a better taste in our mouths and memories.   Food: excellent. We had the tostadas of yellowtail, tuna and salmon. Sashimis of Cajun Albacore, yellowtail yuzu, salmon mascarpone and salmon avocado creme. The mascarpone pairing was interesting and unexpectedly delightful. Standout was definitely the Cajun albacore: bomb.   We had the three mochi selections and green tea creme brulee. The latter may be the most excellent creme brulee I've ever had except for maybe the unparalleled delight of my first CB ever. This one was fragrant, creamy and the taste and texture was lick-spoon outstanding.   Tried the coconut sake- pretty coconuty and smooth. The green tea had no aftertaste and was obviously brewed at perfect temp, fragrant, just lovely.",

    "text": "I was craving sushi, so I popped into this place. Maybe it's just my taste, but I probably won't be coming back.  1. The food is really expensive. They don't have AYCE, so you'll easily be spending $30 on two rolls. 2. I wasn't expecting to see real crab in the California roll. I think that's great, but it was really dry and didn't have the texture I'm used to. 3. My soda tasted flat or watery. 4. There's only one soy sauce option, and be careful because it's salty AF.  I left rather unsatisfied and disappointed because I couldn't even finish my food.  **Update** I have recently visited this location again because my friend raved about their happy hour menu. I really like their happy hour menu because select items are $5.   We ordered the sliders, firecracker rolls, calamari and a few other rolls.   I loved everything I ate and paid only $30 for like 6 items. The happy hour is the way to go! I go here more often now.",

    "text": "Service started off slow despite the numerous amount of servers working but once they got our order in, food came out quickly and they checked on us often... however, servers tended to not clear the table after we were done eating and only cleared the table when there was more food coming out. Other than that, no complaints about my dining experience here.  Happy hour here is legit! Rolls are 6-8 pieces and they offer sashimi and carpaccio for only $5.   Baked mussels: mussels were on the bigger side and I thought they were average. At least they weren't over cooked and super chewy.   Cajun albacore sashimi: one of my favorite dishes but it seems like they add daikon? on everything and the sauce was a bit too much. Nonetheless, still a good amount and I usually don't like albacore but I enjoyed this dish.  Kalbi ribs: would not order again. It was one rib cut into 4-5 pieces and was a little on the burnt side. Flavor was still good though, but I'd rather buy it at Greenland market and grill it myself.  Ika geso: 3 pieces of grilled squid which my friends enjoyed but I didn't have any.   Spicy tuna roll: average roll but it was super spicy! My friends can usually handle spicy but they even commented on how it's on the spicier side.   Crispy Brussels sprouts: would not order again. The Brussels sprout was practically falling apart so we got more leaves than the actual Brussels sprout. I wasn't a fan of the sauce because it was a bit on the sour side and I felt that the sprouts weren't crispy as we had hoped.  Mixed tempura : crispy tempura pieces which came with 2 shrimp tempera and 3 other veggie pieces. The sweet potato piece that I had was still undercooked so it was on the hard side. I probably wouldn't order it again.  Salmon carpaccio: another one of my favorites. 5 pieces of salmon with some toppings and arugula on top. Again, they overdid it with the sauce but luckily the sauce wasn't too overpowering or salty.   Seafood dynamite roll (with no cream cheese): I think it's a deep fried roll with a ton of daikon and arugula on top. I wasn't a huge fan because I could hardly taste any fish.  Probably will not order again.  Salmon avocado roll: average roll. I think their rolls  are a little smaller than usual rolls but it's because they don't pack on a ton of rice. Salmon to rice ratio was perfect and they didn't skimp on the avocado!   My friend also tried their uni, 2 big pieces ($10), he said it was one of the best he's had.   Great place to come for some quality sushi, especially for happy hour!",

Listened to what we liked and didn't like and made sure to provide us with a memorable meal. To be honest, i don't usually eat anything raw, but tonight 50% of what i ate was raw! The way they prepare it makes it so palatable. The sunny roll and the escolar were delicious, and the shishito peppers were addictive! I liked the Brussels sprouts, super crispy!

    "text": "Update to Soho's review was definitely needed. My friend and I had been wanting to come here for a while as we haven't been here for years. I randomly decided to ask her to come with me to dinner one afternoon and here this experience went. Lol Unfortunately, it was a day it rains in Vegas (as we all know, that doesn't happen often). I had got off work from a far hospital at 530ish, but due to the rain, it took a while for both of us to arrive at the restaurant. It was pretty busy at the restaurant and a lot of people waiting. I had asked the hostess what would happen if our wait for a table exceeds the time limit of happy hour (which was the main reason we wanted to come, and had come many times in the past), she had assured us that we will still receive the happy hour pricing, even if it passes the time. Great news as we would have been sad lol. I am not sure when they changed the times, but the happy hour now goes from 0400P - 0700P. Supposedly they take reservations now. Had i known earlier, i would have called. But as stated, it worked out anyway.   After waiting a while, we had finally got a table maybe at 0645P. After we were seated, we had the happy hour menus. They seemed to have added some stuff since my last visit. Aside from the food, they offer beers/sake/sangria as cheap as $3 and wines at $5.   SOHO Wings includes choice of garlic Parmesan, yuzu miso, or nutty habenero. I had asked for yuzu miso. Not as what i expected. It is mildly sweet with a very light hint of miso. The batter seems a bit \"thick\", not in actual thickness but it not being that light in texture. I'm still on the hunt for the best fried chicken in town, that can match the korean fried chicken in LA or Seoul. XD   We had also tried the Firecracker roll because i had remembered there was a happy hour item that had crispy rice. This definitely was not it. Lol The firecracker roll states it includes deep fried, spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, and sweet onions. Neither of us like cream cheese in our sushi, so we opt'ed out of that. This was literally a deep fried spicy tuna roll topped with sweet onions and jalapeno. Wonder what the crispy rice one which resembles the crispy rice you get from like a dolsot bibimbap or those clay pot rice. Mildly weird with the sweet pickled-like onions on top.   Typically our favorites from the old happy hour menu are the tostadas for a dollar and salmon avocado roll. Very simple items but yummy.   The tostadas as previously made, were individual tostada chips with a good amount of toppings (salmon, tuna, octopus, or yellowtail). Now, the \"SOHO Tostada\" is a choice of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, or mixed seafood. They used to be simply made, with simple seasoning and ingredients. Tuna was very similar to hawaiian poke. Now, instead of individual topped tostadas, the fish of choice is placed in a small bowl in the middle of a plate with 5 tostada chips surrounding. You do get about the same amount of topping as you used to, if not more, but i feel like they add a lot of things to \"brighten\" it up like pineapples, etc. Still tasty but would have preferred how it used to be. Soho was known to use fresh fish so unsure why all the \"extra\" is needed.   Best and simplest item is still the salmon avocado rolls. 8 pieces per order. Simply delicious. Nothing to be said. Fresh fish  Overall, glad they extended the happy hour but unfortunately even if I can get off at 4pm, most dont get off till at least 6. But i think happy hour runs into the weekend too, which i dont think they offered before (dont quote me on this, call to confirm....)  I used to get this ghost pepper chili sauce the owner/chef used to make. Unsure if this is still available. A previous time i had tried to ask for it and they said they didn't have it or didn't make it anymore.   Overall, love their happy hour. Good for dinner or just a snack. XD (piggy)",

Quality sashimi, delicious sauces. Not one of those places that serves 50 million made-up rolls mostly consisting of spicy mayo and other filler ingredients. The focus here is more on bringing out the taste of the quality fish, not overdoing it with the sauces. For instance, their California roll is made with 100% real crab meat!!! I never liked California rolls because most use imitation meat. I love crab so I will eat them here!!  The owner and staff were very attentive and nice. The owner even gave me a free dish of sea bass sushi to try for free...and it was delicious. They had a green tea creme brulee that they are still deciding if they will put on the menu.....its a keeper...YUM! The peach lychee sake is awesome and made in-house! Prices are good for the quality you get. Happy Hour menu has great selections and awesome is an awesome deal. I will be a REGULAR here!!",

Every member of their staff was super friendly from the moment we walked into the moment we walked out.  They have a great happy hour menu (for drinks and for food) and the sushi was delicious.  Service was also super quick despite it being fully packed.  Our waiter was super nice and when he realized it was my birthday, totally hooked me up with some J Pop and a great plate of delicious, fresh tuna.  I really can't say enough good things about this place.  Incredible service, food, and value.  We'll be back soon!",

    "text": "This was the happiest surprise gem of a restaurant! The rich, deep, hearty miso soup was the best I've had. The thin, crisp, succulent tempura is good enough to knock your socks off. Twice. California rolls were dainty and appetizing. Even the soy sauce was served in soy pots, and the ginger had a nuance I've never tasted before. Here's where it gets interesting: the triple S roll was delicious with a little kick. I thought it would be my favorite, but things only got better from there. Chef brought out their specialty yellowtail dish, which was beautifully cut, topped with a subtle-tasting micro cilantro, and thinly sliced tempura Serrano. The light dressing had a clean taste, and this will no doubt be a favorite of mine when the heat strikes in summer. Chef also brought garlic tuna tetake, which was perfectly seasoned and had a delightful crunchy garnish. It all was so good, my mom and husband, who don't eat much fish, liked it. My dad ordered a rainbow roll for dessert (also excellent). The real dessert menu was refreshing for a Japanese restaurant. We shared a chocolate mousse cake, and that was a mistake; sharing, that is. This caliber of food is something you'd find in a Michelin star restaurant. However, the prices are affordable. The atmosphere is welcoming and pleasant, not too fussy. The staff and chef made the whole experience all the more enjoyable. They were very accommodating with our two small children and offered to rearrange the chairs to ensure our comfort. A winning combination of high quality food, fair price, great service, cleanliness (they wiped our tables before dessert), I could go on, but will spare you for now. Go see for yourself, you won't regret it.",

Soho is not your typical AYCE spot, but more of a chill, date spot where you order tapas of sashimi and smaller entree portions. Don't go hungry! It is on the pricier side but you'd go there for quality, tasty fish. Each dish had wonderful presentation! I love love love sashimi so I ordered what my server recommended, which were the Yellowtail Yuzu and Ume Scallop. Each dish had the perfect flavor and texture, they were definitely served fresh. We also ordered the Miso Black Cod, which was very delicious. The cod was almost buttery and had the softest texture to the bite. The Bone-In Short Rib was yummy as well...the meat just fell off the bone, the knife they provided was of no use! Haha. Chef John came over to our table to check up on what we thought of our entrees and noticed we enjoyed our sashimi, so he offered to have us try some fresh Wild Saba that had just arrived for them. That was my first time trying Wild Saba and the chef was right about it being fresh! Received the check and was  so surprised the Wild Saba was on the house...thanks again, Chef John!",

To top it all, the owner himself welcomed us, a very gracious man and let us try their/his specialty: yellow tail yuzu soy. The verdict... I would give this place a 6-star review if allowed. Am so excited there is a place like this that I can frequent.",

I asked what kids eat here, he said \"just like adults, california roll, tempra\" etc. I had never been here before and I was ordering menu. As I was trying to find something for my girls, the waiter said that the more i take longer to order, the more i have to wait for the food to come. He said why not ordering some now and after we eat and we can keep adding the order later. So that's what i did. The food was good, but over priced. I asked two spoon for my kids, and they brought the big adult spoons that my girls coundn't even put them in mouth because it was so big. We finished all we ordered initially, so i ordered one more roll. It never came, but was surely on my bill. The waiter never apologized for not completing my order. I will never come back to this place again, at least for dinner or with family. maybe ok place for adults only.",

We were pleasantly surprised about the happy hour menu & started our order w/ the albacore tuna sashimi for $5 which was explained as the happy hr version of their signature dish of yellow tail sashimi. Unbelievable! After the first few pieces another was ordered immediately. We also had the crunchy shrimp tempura roll, amazing... We continued with an order of their signature yellow tempura sashimi, which was absolutely unbelievable delicious! Spicy Salmon roll, awesome! Beef tadas, so good & ended w/ the chefs specialty steelhead trout sashimi, special belly cut served w/ pop rocks, and I have to say, I am officially in love with Soho! The reviews say it all!!! Definitely the best find & now our fav sushi/Japanese place and best of all, we live just around the corner, luck us!!!! We will def be regulars, what an awesome find!!!",

We were going through the menu and saw Ocean Trout with Pop Rocks. I know we thought the same thing but we're feeling a little daring and it was so worth it. Ocean trout looks like salmon but tastes 10x better and danced with the tingly sweetness of the pop rock candy. The Garlic Shishto peppers were out of this world. We were lucky enough to be checked on by the chef who was amazing! He recommended we try a dish that was Jack Stripe fish with Uni and it was outstanding!!!! My wife is not the biggest fan of Uni but once she tasted Soho's Catalina Island Uni she was sold. We finished off the meal with the Green Tea Tiramuso refreshingly delicious!  We have already made plans to return. We definitely recommend you come and try Soho. You will love it just like we do!",

So...just to break away from the Las Vegas strip...we ventured away to find Soho, and it was the best find!!!  It is in a strip mall...but as soon as you walk in, you are welcomed with pleasant waitresses, and a calm and modern interior.  The menu is simple, not really crazy with all sorts of funky rolls, as we come to find out that it's known for fresh fish, sashimi!  We ordered their salmon tapas/tostadas and tuna tapas/tostadas, which was delicious, light and just melt in your mouth good!  Then, the sushi chef and owner, John Lee, came out and invited us to try the mixed sashimi special.  He asked us what type of raw fish we like...and of course, we didn't hold back to give our favorites!  Once the entree came out, we were floored with the generous portions and quality.  We had salmon, tuna, uni, saba, hamachi, scallop, trout, and aji.  But let me tell you, all of the bites of sashimi just melted into our mouths...and we knew we had to come back another time before we left town...which we did.  Highly recommend the treck off the strip to eat at this place.  We will be back again for more!!!",

    "text": "Went for happy hour last week with a couple of friends that said we had to try this place...5 star, etc, etc, etc.  We arrived at 5pm and the place was about half full.  We were greeted immediately, and sat very quickly.  The server took time to explain the menu and all of the dishes we had questions on.  Service AWESOME!  After perrussing the menu, my wife and I decided to order the happy hour menu (yes, the whole menu.)  We love sushi, fish, and generally food itself.  Our friends looked at us surprised, and then we knew, they were not the same sushi people we were (nor the eaters like us.)  Nevertheless, the menu arrived (along with a couple of chef comps.)  We enjoyed everything on the menu, but did not consider it to be a 5 star level.  Although the food was clean and presented very well, we have had better tasting sushi elsewhere.  That is not to say that we would not come back (because we would if we are on that side of town again.)  There was a $25 sashimi platter that looked very, very good, but we did not order it on that visit.  We would recommend the happy hour for very reasonable prices, and if you are having a nice cocktail while eating.  We will definitely see you again Soho.",

They have Happy Hour again, and  2. They take reservations by call.  Totally helpful since we probably would've waited an hour to get seated had my fiance not called ahead to make a reservation. Geez... There was at least 3 tables put together for a huge group!  The food is still fresh and amazing. Like I can still order my favorite Golden Ocean Trout. It's great surprise to go back every couple months and realize that they switched the menu up too, which are mostly items on the Happy Hour menu.  Gotta send good vibes to the staff for providing great customer service no matter the time of day. Plus, I like seeing the regular friendly faces.",

It was our first time there so we were a bit confused on what to order, but our server was very helpful with that! We started off with an order of Edamame and an order of Shishito peppers. Both really good! Then for our sushi rolls we went with a Firecracker roll, Shrimp tempura roll, and Dynamite roll. Really enjoyed the first two, dynamite roll was good once I took out some of the cream cheese lol. It was just very over powering. All in all, had a wonderful dinner there, can't wait to go back!",

I sometimes come for the lunch specials too  If I remember correctly it's Monday to Saturday from 5 to 7 for their happy hour menu. It was basically about 5 bucks a plate. Some varied but the stuff we ordered was in that range.   Didn't take a photo of all our food. Since it's happy hour the portion is a tad smaller so we ordered about 5 plates to share.   Mix tempura: red bell pepper, two shrimp tempura, onion, and I think a zucchini. This was good. I didn't notice an overly extended amount of batter.   Baked muscles: these were good! They had Yuzu sauce or some ponzu sauce in it that made the flavors balance out and it didn't feel as heavy because of the sauce.   Crispy brussel sprout: yummmm!! The mixture of textures, nice n crispy, they had some nuts in it for a bite. And the sauce in the middle, not even sure what it was but it was BOMB.   Spider roll and spicy salmon roll. I like how they put these little crunchy balls on top of the rolls. I'm not sure how to describe the taste but added crunch. As always fish is fresh!   Can't forget that Infused sake! Lychee is my favorite one. Mmmmm. Their lunch specials are pretty good too. Love the variety.",

He is the most spectacular and attentive sushi chef I've ever met and he truly made my dinning experience here such a memorable one!   I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary/birthday dinner. We were quite skeptical of this place at first because all the sushi chefs were just young handsome looking men! We got seated at the sushi bar and Chef Tei was our chef/server.   He was literally the nicest and sweetest server ever. We ordered the sushi platter and he told us that they ran out of a certain fish but he made it up with something even better. He also served us many complimentary sides! He noticed that we liked the yellowtail from the sushi platter so he specifically made us a complimentary yellowtail appetizer which was very sweet of him. We also got the sushi giri platter after and he said they ran out of some of the fishes so he let us choose any kind of sashimi we wanted on top without any extra charge! Not to mention, the food was so fresh and reasonable for the price.  I later asked for hot water and another server got it for me and I told me boyfriend it wasn't hot enough. Chef Tei somehow noticed that we weren't satisfied with the waters temperature and personally boiled us some HOT water. That was so nice of him.   Chef Tei chatted with us and always checked in on us to make sure we were comfortable and was having a good dinning experience. It was like an omakase dinning experience with him but for a fraction of the price! I could tell he really put effort into making our food and tried to make a connection with us. I made sure to tip him really well because he TRULY deserved it. I would definitely come back to visit when I'm vegas!  I had such a fun time dinning thanks to Chef Tei. Thank you sooo much Chef Tei for making my sushi dinning experience the best I've ever had :)",

For those that say or even believe there is always room for improvement, not here, it's beyond excellent really!!! Many types of flavors, food, and choices for every palate! I can't wait to go back ASAP! We did their happy hour menu all food items are $5 \"small plates\", and I want to say most of their adult beverages were also $5 or discounted! Not a Sake drinker but, the white peach cold infused Sake was very smooth and I will try their tropical flavored ones the next time I am there!! Happy Hour I think is Mon thru Sat from 1200pm to 1900pm, if going in early evening go early because they fill up fast and apparently they do take reservations for their Happy Hour! Mahalo SoHo Restaurant for an awesome experience, if there were more stars to give I would, you're off the charts!!!",

    "text": "Soho is one of the best options for sushi in Las Vegas, easy!!! I wish more people would venture off the strip to locations like this. Easy to access, right off the 215, Soho has never disappointed. If you're a tuna crispy rice (crispy tuna roll here) and yellowtail with ponzu regular at Nobu, Soho's is more than comparable. Also love their rock shrimp tempura and shishitos.   The stand out here in my opinion is their cold dishes, the first listed on the menu. For Sen regulars, I think this is what puts Soho a step above, as well as the slightly smaller, more digestible menu with all the necessities. I sample several cold dishes (all sashimi style fish) every time I come, either by myself or as share plates with others. The chefs love to experiment and usually always hit the nail, so don't be cautious, I swear they won't disappoint. The yellowtail yuzu and seared garlic tuna are classics, but I'm a stickler for the golden ocean trout and cajun albacore. Last time I had a great dish with truffle too! Wouldn't order it every time, but it was a great change of pace. Ultimately, Soho is worth a trip for locals and tourists alike!",

Room temperature feels like it's about 85, which isn't bad. But people need air conditioning when walking in from 110 outside. Turn on the A/C!",

S.F. & L.A. was great HK but this one knockoff it out of the park, city, state and country!!!  Impressive happy hour specials: Containing very good fusion sashimi, rolls and a variety of items to choose from.  The owner is very interested in providing you an experience that will have you and your friends return and become regulars!!  He sent over a truffle sashimi dish that was tasty!  Very personable place that will soon become one of my hang outs since it is near one of my friends house!!!  A nice casual place that showcases the owners creativity and allows for one to relax, have fun & (of course) have a great meal experience!!!  Was having too much fun to even take pictures of the tasty food!  So,  just come here and enjoy the experience...",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews, yet I dine more than most people alive. I think Yelp is generally for annoying customers trying to get free offers, and a small handful of educated food lovers who help us make decision. The reason I am prefacing this review, is because this restaurant deserves it.  Soho Japanese House is my \"Go To\" Sushi spot, luckily I live close. The service is A class, the happy hour is the best value-to-quality I have seen in the city of Las Vegas. Many sushi spots use their technique of A.Y.C.E. yet in that method the house always wins. Average people can only eat 2-3 rolls and they make large margins on the \"average\" fish they use. The Happy Hour at Soho is an itemized A la carte, where everything is $5. Great quality fish is used, my personal go-to's are the Salmon Yuzu Soy, Beef Tataki and Cajun Albacore... it's practically up to Nobu's $28 for 6 thinly sliced Yellowtail Jalepeno crudo, and the value is 6 TIMES higher!  Yet Soho does not strive to be like the top echelon of sushi dining like other local spots Kame, Kabuto, Nobu, Zuma etc... this is a local spot, run by a group of people, that if they aren't family, they sure as hell seem like they are. Best value, best service, best quality for the price point in which they rare set. Do yourself a favor, and go at happy hour any day of the week (besides Sunday) and you will not regret it.",

I know CA rolls are not real sushi, however, I was super impressed with their Salmon avocado rolls, which by the way is on their happy hour menu. Wow, they used some very fatty and good salmon in their rolls!!! It was also a smaller bite lol, on purpose or not, I think was actually the perfect size. It was so good, I went for another plate (not in photo). Oh, happy hour starts at 3pm and the menu for it was very extensive and got some good items to choose from. We also got the yellowtail tostado - good. The uni - fresh, scallop- fresh but too tiny.  Overall, even though not an ayce place, the quality of the food and the happy hour menu makes up for it.

One thing you should know about me is that I absolutely love miso marinated black cod! Soho does an excellent version of this and you cannot beat the price! ($18)  Some of my faves:  -Miso marinated black cod -Yellowtail yuzu  -Salmon w/ cream something -Tuna tadas  -Salmon tadas  These are just OK: -Twin dragon roll - Alaskan crab, shrimp tempura. Sounds exciting. It wasn't all that jazz. I'm not really a \"roll\" type. ($15) -Rock shrimp tempura - Comes with three sauces. Two of which are useless. Go with the banana sauce. Trust me. ($9) -Nigerian prawn - This one of the specials. It was just a single, but large prawn. Hard to eat. Knife and fork style. Flavors weren't mind blowing either. Next!  Pinch me, I must be dreaming, maybe I am considering that I am writing this at 4 in the morning, but...there is happy hour from 4-6 PM? Where was my invite? *Ahem* $1 tadas? Dolla dolla bill y'all. I'm there.   Hands down, best non-AYCE sushi spot! It's all about quality, quality, quality and decent pricing. Love it!",

Fantastic, comfortable chairs to wait in except for the fact that you can't really see the TV screen as it's angled away from the waiting area. The only thing to do while sitting down is deeply question your dining choices, and questioning the rationality behind waiting hours for seats which are already empty. I decided to dine elsewhere to save my sanity and that is one of the better choices I've made so far for the new year. The food is decent nothing that you cannot get at any other sushi bar. It's only worth it for happy hour which is from 4-7 and still quite pricey for a average meal. Honest review of food/service/ambiance would be 2/5.",

They will have an hour wait on a random weeknight. During happy hour you must make a reservation or good luck getting a table. My only complaint is they typically don't have a lot of servers working so service does get extremely slow during busy hours. I've often had to wait a while to even be greeted by a server or have my food delivered to me. Plan to spend some time at Soho.  It looks like a hole in the wall but it's gorgeous inside and a good atmosphere. They have TVs playing sports. It's the only place we can catch Dodger games around here! Also, though the same company I believe, don't mix this up with the sushi burrito place. That's across the street, and this is much better and different, in my opinion.  Otherwise, the experience is to die for. The food is absolutely amazing. They even have one of the best lunch specials...so much food for such a good price. But happy hour is definitely my guilty pleasure. A menu full of $5 bites and drinks. The portions are pretty big, shareable among two. I love the carpaccio, the ribs, the rolls, the Brussels sprouts, there's really nothing I don't like on the happy hour menu. But please try the ribs, you won't regret it.  Also, my favorite treat is the green tea brulee. It is so good and unique.",

If you're looking for a legit sushi joint in LV that won't break the bank, Soho is the way to go.  Went here last week at about 8 p.m. and had to wait 30 min for a table for a party of 2. My sister & I were starrrrving and our table couldn't have come any sooner.  Ordered: 1. salmon tostada & yellowtail tostada ($2 each). I love yellowtail but actually preferred the salmon one. They were still both delicious! I loved the avocado and chip thing the fish came on. The only thing I would change about this dish is I would make it at least two times bigger! So friggin tiny, especially if you're friggin starving and ready to eat a horse!!!  2. Spicy tuna on crispy rice. This was my first time ordering this and now I order it everywhere I go, hoping to get the same taste! The rice is crispy on the outside but perfectly chewy on the inside. I would definitely order this again when I go back.   Tbh, I don't remember anything else I ordered. But it was delicious and prices were reasonable. In Vegas? Jackpot!",

I really prefer simple sushi and nigiri that doesn't have a whole bunch of stuff piled in or on top, this place definitely caters to a simple sushi palate which is the main reason why I come here. Another great feature is that they have amazing portions a $15 sushi roll will have 10-12 pieces on the plate. I do wish they had an all you can eat but I don't think the menu is large enough for that. If you do stop by you should try the salmon belly nigiri it's so fresh and they bring a good sized sliver of it. It's a really cute place too very clean the staff is nice and attentive they remember you if you've been in before which I like.",

Had to send it back it was extremely salty.  Second try, the hamachi was under cooked. Rice was undercooked on my third try.    After third visit, I finally concluded, I don't like the rice.  If it says SOHO Asian restaurant, I would not expect sushi rice to be served.    I find the rice undercook during all visit for my taste, then I found out from the server that they don't use Japanese rice at all.    If you are someone who is looking for the authentic Japanese home made food, I would choose Kyara (215/jones exit) or Izagaya Go (spring mt/valley view) instead.    I ended up turning to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi on my fourth attempt.",

    "text": "Sorry Soho. When I came here again, I faced disappointment, which really sucked because my husband and I loved this place. We came the second time and sadly will not be reuturning. We ordered the more expensive sashimi platter, and somehow we got less fish than the last time whe we ordered the less expensive platter. Not only the quantity of the fish, but the quality of the fish went down too even though we paid more this time. We got albacore on the more expensive sashimi platter, and honestly albacore is definitely not my favorite fish and I usually see albacore on standard combinations not special ones. Last time we ordered, we got salmon belly and ocean trout! How come with the more expensive one we got even less premium fishes? We had also ordered the salmon ceviche which tasted just okay even though last time I came the ceviche was my favorite part of the meal! And this is not the biggest deal, but I asked what the market price was for the sweet shrimp, and the server didn't know and gave me a random number, but it ended up being more expensive than he said and he never came to let us know he gave us incorrect information. The reason for the downfall in this updated review is mostly due to the disappointment of the sashimi platter, the food just tasting average, and the time I felt was not used wisely since I had such a high expectation. I will not be back. I am sorry.",

The quality of the fish is so amazing it taste like it came straight out of the ocean.   Even better than the fish quality this place is packing, the main chef and his brother are amazing. It was customer service at its finest. The main sushi chef and his brother are sure to give you the best experience possible. What more could you ask for from a sushi restaurant?",

If I were being ultra picky, yes, I could probably figure one menu item I'm not crazy about or that this other thing could have used a little more dressing.. that goes with every restaurant, practically.  This place IS THE BEST restaurant in Vegas, hands down.   The food is incredible, tasty, and fresh.  I just went back recently and everything - I mean EVERYTHING I had was DELICIOUS - OK??!!!  I'm a fan of the original NOBU in NY and this rivals it at a tiny fraction of the price.  Anyone who states this food here is (4) star or less, either is a hater or never eats less than 5 star food in their silver-spoon fed life.

I've been here three times and have had a different experience each visit.   First time: excellent service with gratuitous additions of sashimi to sample.   Second time: overall fine, but we had that questionable experience where one sashimi dish is super cold and the other is warm. It makes you hope the fish wasn't cooled to mask poor flavors/quality.   Third time: good food, but horrible location. The tiny bistro table near the front door is 1) too small to enjoy food and 2) too close to the door when there is inclement weather - and such was our night.  In the end, the sashimi here is delicious and the combinations of flavors are impressive. I could eat \"yellowtail yuzu\" for the rest of my life; ponzu and cilantro are brilliant together. Another favorite: the \"salmon wasabi creme fraiche.\"",

My favorite part about this was it allowed to eat something in my comfort zone, but try something different as well knowing I wasn't breaking the bank for food I wouldn't enjoy! Their happy hour is Mon-Sat at 5-7pm, and they have the following dishes on the happy hour menu:   Escolar Carpaccio Cajun Albacore Sashimi Angus Slider Truffle Tempura Baked Mussels Crispy Brussel Sprouts Bronze Broccoli Salmon Avocado Roll Shrimp Tempura Roll Spicy Tuna Roll Ceviche  They also have some drinks, and I would recommend trying some sake while you are there. Jelly sake was not on the happy hour menu, but I would recommend it because it's just really cool and tastes great (like a jello shot, but much less messy)!  My partner and I ended up getting the spicy tuna roll, salmon avocado roll, and cajun albacore sashimi. I would recommend all 3!  The atmosphere is wonderful, service is great (even though the place was packed when we were there), and much more bang for buck than eating on the strip.  Update!  We returned with two of our friends and it seems as if they expanded the happy hour menu (no complaints here) and 4 of us were able to eat and drink for $70. Additionally at this visit, our waitress was amazing making recommendations on what to try (we all typically stick to sushi rolls instead of sashimi) and everything we tried was indeed delicious. This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!!",

Their happy hour is great for those on a budget who still enjoy great sushi--they offer rolls like shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and others for around $5. They also have these great little sushi tostadas for $1 during HH, which are a fun snack.  I also tried the amaebi, or sweet raw shrimp (not on the HH menu). They told me that I could get *live* shrimp--so I went for it! It was the freshest tasting shrimp I've ever had.  I like the ambiance here--it's a True neighborhood joint. A lot of people came to the sushi counter to talk to the sushi chefs, and the waiters seemed familiar with regulars.  The only complaint I had was the rice. It's kind of like a brown rice? Doesn't seem too authentic. And rice is like 80% of good sushi.  All in all though, definitely worth a try!",

    "text": "I went here with my family for lunch after my dad's friend recommended this place and I can see why. The staff here are extremely friendly and welcoming. The chef even came by our table to welcome us and thank us for coming =)   A few things we ordered were the soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura roll, california roll, short ribs and the seared tuna and they were all AMAZING. The sushi here is so fresh and hand made by the chef himself. The short ribs were extremely tender and mouth watering. You didn't need a knife to cut them because it was easy to tear apart.  Aside from what we ordered, the chef actually gave us yellowtail sashimi on the house!!! It was such a nice gesture and it tasted fantastic!  The only downside to our visit was the main chef was not there because he was on vacation so we were not given the whole menu, BUT that's okay because I'm sure my family and I will come back again :D",

They just opened up about a month ago and I want nothing more than to see this business boom. I sat at the bar and the owner Jon gave me the best service! I had the BEST uni I have ever had and some of the freshest sashimi (yellowtail, salmon, scallops, hamachi, snapper, aji). LOVED the shishito peppers and the Hawaiian poke tostada. He even went as far as giving me one of their speciality sashimi dishes on the house and surprised me with another order of peppers as we left since he knew my mom called me asking for some to go! I'm really hoping the locals will come here! I look forward to trying their green tea tiramisu, short ribs, and their 8.50 lunch special!",

We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi and the White Fish Special.  I cannot do justice to the freshness and quality of the sashimi - superb!  Next was the Hydro Bibb Black Cod -the crispy cod was delicious! The BF had two of the tostadas - one shrimp with mango and one salmon with pico de gallo - both of which were devoured with joy!  While he worked on the crispy tuna roll, I was having a Harry Met Sally moment with my Salmon Belly - OMG!  Creamy, buttery bliss!  As I was trying to make my moment last, the BF was having his own with the Vanilla Cream Brulee ( I am jello) made with vanilla beans! Everyone is so warm and genuine!  I love Soho!!!!!",

    "text": "not sure what the hype is about soho japanese restaurant.  yes, the portions are decent.  yes, the prices are dirt cheap.  but come on, there's more to rating a good sushi spot than just price.  the QUALITY of the food was average at best!    i ordered the sashimi lunch combo, the yellowtail with yuzu sauce and a few pieces of hotate nigiri.  the miso soup was super bland(served us miso soup with a spoon), the sashimi was not very good quality.  you could tell it had been frozen for awhile because there wasn't the usual firm texture to fresh fish.  the hotate came out really brown and was super mushy.  definitely not fresh.    soho japanese restaurant really caters to a more americanized pallet offering rolls with a ton of sauces and deep fried blah blah in it.  wasn't my thing.  for REAL authentic sushi, please drive a little further away from the strip and spend a little bit more at sen of japan or kabuto.  it is worth your time and money.  for a quick, fast and cheap meal...i would recommend Soho.  if you're looking for authentic, FRESH sushi, this is not the place for you.",

His professionalism and sincere warmth is definitely the determining factor in wanting to return one more time before we leave Vegas.",

I'm from Alaska so I'm just a liiiiiiiiiittle snobby about seafood. The experience and food was great. The fusion take on dishes were creative and well executed. I became a fan and so I returned. My second experience was just as good and Chef John even went the extra mile and introduced me to uni for the first time--on the house mind you!  It was soft buttery and sweet as people always had told me uni was supposed to be.  And then it went downhill from there. Couple more times I've tried to come back and either the wait was long or the host was extremely unorganized. Sometimes both. It's not good if both I and the employees are flustered. But the food had never wavered. My boyfriend insisted on trying this place with me since I had always talked so highly of it. We came for dinner, calling ahead, and trusted Chef John with omakase. I'll give credit for presentation, but unfortunately, both mine and my boyfriend's palette wasn't agreeing with any of the selection. It wasn't anyone's fault but I was really hopeful. There was an array from mackerel, scallops to tuna, but we weren't digging any of the flavors. With a couple bottles of hot sake the bill came to around $140. I don't mind coming back, but it's just not high on my radar anymore. Sorry Soho.",

Its not Raku quality sushi and no sturgeon, blue fin etc.; so fine dining this is not. Also the decor and atmosphere is Ultra casual... like Mickie Ds style and doesnt match the price. The service was good but not great at the price point. It is not cheap we dropped $100 for two people lunch. What they do right is the non sashimi happy hour stuff. Like fusion sushi tacos etc. I think for an American style fast sushi (think sushi panda express) this is good, but I have had sashimi in LA and Vegas that puts it to shame for not much more $. Just my .02 as I have been eating at sushi joints every week for about 10 years.",

Some times you just gotta go for quality over quantity.  First off, we were greeted very warmly and it was very evident from the get go that service is a priority at this restaurant.  She explained what the most popular dishes and specials of the day were.  We ended up going with a few of them and were not disappointed.  The highlight of the evening was the Hamachi with yuzu, shoyu and fried serrano chili ($12).  So good.  Hamachi was super tender, the yuzu, ponzu sauce was awesome and the thinly sliced serrano chili added a nice kick of heat, it's mild because it's so thinly sliced and also fried so it takes some of the heat out.  Everyone agreed it was the favorite dish.  Thanks for our waitresses recommendations!  I can see why its their most popular dish.  Big eye poke ($15) was excellent quality of fish but i thought there was too much sesame oil, i ended up dipping each piece in shoyu to cut thru it, so good.  Garlic Tuna tataki ($12) very fresh fish and tasty.  Tadas ($2 each) Their take on tostadas, nice little bites of raw fish on mini deep-fried wontons.  We tried the salmon and hamachi.  Wish i had tried them all, but theres always next time.  We also ordered 2 rolls ($15 each), the Twin Dragon and Triple S, mostly for filler since most of our items didn't include rice.  The Triple S  (scallop, shrimp and spicy tuna) was kind of forgettable.  The Twin Dragon however, was delicious!  King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and shrimp tempura on top.  It had a very strong shell fish flavor and a nice crunch from the 2 shrimp tempura on top.  After eating that we ordered the mixed tempura ($7), nice and crunchy and a nice selection, shrimp, broccoi, kabocha, shishito pepper, cant remember the other stuff.  We also ordered King Crab tempura too, which was nice, but pricy. a few pieces of crab leg lightly battered, Yum!  Garlic shishito peppers - it had a sweetness to it that i didn't care for, but one of my friends though it was the best dish of the evening.  The decor is a bit confusing, it looks a bit thrown together but the food is very good and very fresh, but what most stands out is the service!",

The fish here is SO FRESH.  Best fish I have had to date.  The chef orders fish fresh daily from the best places in the world, and oh my goodness it shows.  We got a large variety of appetizers + two rolls.  Their menu changes sometimes based on what they have in, so I'd highly recommend that you ask the server what's new.

We ordered 4 items off the happy hour menu: spicy tuna roll, salmon and avocado roll, a shrimp tempura roll and albacore sashimi. While these items all sound basic, they were anything but. They tasted so fresh and full of flavor. I actually loved the simplicity of the rolls because I am so sick of the typical sauce-drenched rolls masking their mediocrity behind pools of spicy mayo and dollops of eel sauce. In stark contrast, you could taste the fresh fish of each of these rolls, along with whatever crisp or tender veggie it was rolled with, and perfectly cooked rice served at just the right temperature as needed to taste the balance of the subtle rice vinegar.   We sat at the sushi bar and watched the chefs create all of their masterpieces. It was mesmerizing. Even while there were extremely busy, they were always friendly and helpful and found time to check on us. The chef saw my friend give me a birthday card and they sent out some Mochi with a birthday candle and the whole restaurant sang happy birthday. It was the nicest thing ever! The food and the service were both amazing and this is now my new favorite spot. To top it off, because we made it for happy hour, our bill was unbelievably low.",

Yellowtail Yuzo Soy (fresh and covered with perfectly tasting citrus/soy sauce marinade),  Fire Dragon Roll (good, but would've personally liked milder spiciness) and Miso Marinated Cod lettuce wraps were the selection for my husband and I. While we ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura with edamame for our sons. We were all pleased and satisfied with our meals.   We initially requested for some dishes suggested by a friend, and was told they would make it even though it's no longer on the menu. So, don't hesitate to ask because they'll make it for you! And lastly something I learned from my husband today is to ask for fresh wasabi. They do charge $1 for it, but it does make a difference in taste.   Definitely going back again and next time concluding the meal with some matcha tiramisu. They were sold out, so I'm thinking it must be one divine desert!",

    "text": "Finally I understand what my wife has been preaching about for the past three years.  Incredible quality, creative sushi, amazing value. Plus, the best happy hour specials. Ever.  My wife travels to Vegas one a year for a conference and this year, I decided to join her. She insisted that we leave the strip for one night and go to Soho. She's been talking about her previous visits for the past three years, and has compared all other Sushi restaurants to Soho since her first visit and now I totally understand why. We sat at the sushi bar so we could watch the chefs create their magic. I'm amazed at how quickly they worked, and how much fun everyone was having. You know it's a great business with great employees because everyone was laughing and cracking jokes all night long. When everyone behind the counter works at the same level and in perfect harmony, that quality is reflected in the end product. After about 4-5 happy hour appetizers, we ordered a few entree rolls. The standout or all of the standouts was the Double Dragon roll. The perfect balance of hot/cold and well as texture, this might be the \"perfect roll\".   Most of these guys cut their teeth at high-end sushi joints on the strip. Here they can be as creative as they wish. Fortunately for them they have access to the best fish in the world.  Soho is proof that some of the best sushi comes from strip malls.  World class quality at non-strip, local-friendly prices.",

Well we did come back; and I'm really glad I did. The service was good as before, but the menu and the food was way way better. This is my first updated review cause they really deserve a re-rating.   We ordered several kinds of carpaccio, sashimi, and rolls (diablo was delish). All were excellent and reasonably priced. The salmon kama was especially surprising, perfectly grilled, mouth watering, with a slightly sweet tangy glaze. The Pork belly was disapointingly small (2 skewers)and under-seasoned. But everything else was on point.   Glad we gave them a second look and glad they have really stepped up their game.",

I was worried the meal wouldn't live up to the high expectations I had, but it certainly did.  I came in for Happy Hour and we tried an assortment of their offerings. Everything we tried was solid, but the standouts from our meal were the salmon tostada, yellowtail, miso cod and the stuffed mushrooms.   We had wanted to order more, but the portions were generous and we filled up quickly for a minimal price. The quality was great for the price and because they offer Happy Hour Mondays through Saturday 4-6, I will be able to go back again during the weekend when it's more convenient for me.   Service was impeccable and no fewer than four different servers checked on us during our meal to make sure we had everything we needed.  I look forward to trying the rest of the menu and even coming in for their lunch specials and dinner menu.",

I've had the sashimi lunch special as well as the chicken katsu lunch special.  the sashimi lunch special portion is very good for the $10 price tag.  you get a couple pieces of salmon, tuna, and Hamachi.  pretty good value.  not to mention rice, miso soup, and a salad.  the katsu lunch also has salad, rice, and miso soup.  the portion for me was a bit small.  wish they gave a little more katsu.  but the flavor and crunch of the katsu was unbelievable.  i've honestly never had katsu this good before.  i don't know what it was, but every bite i took, I kept asking myself if this was the best katsu i've ever had.  and I'm thoroughly convinced it is.    for happy hour, i can't say enough about the ahi tostadas.  i could eat 10 of these.  the hydro bibb miso black cod is so flavorful, delicate, and delicious.  one of my favorite menu items.  hamachi sashimi is wonderful as well.  the sauces and oils the chef adds totally enhances the Hamachi and the flavors dance in your mouth.  everything is so complimentary and the fish is always the star.  rock shrimp tempura was very good as well.  sweet and juicy shrimp in a pillowy tempura batter was quite delicious.  firecracker roll has a lot of fish in and on top of it.  the sauce was spicy without being over powering.    one of my favorite japanese restaurants in las vegas.  strip quality food at local prices.  can't go wrong there.",

Our server, Sheila, was so friendly and gave us great recommendations. The sushi and sashimi were fresh, flavorful and visually appealing. The white peach infused sake was refreshing after a scorching day. The only downside to our new fave was the atmosphere was a bit rowdy. One table of 6 seemed a bit inebriated and made speaking across our table virtually impossible. Once they left, all was good. We will be back. Be sure to ask for Sheila if you're in the area and feel like having some amazing sushi.",

Started off rocky with the server not being able to give us a sashimi menu and proceeded to tell us that two people were on a honeymoon. (From a consumer's standpoint, they don't care for excuses.). They should just say they don't have one available at the time.  Let's get to the menu!  Here's what we got to try out:  Garlic shishito pepper-  tasty and if you're lucky spicy Salmon pico de gallo/ tuna poke sauce- comes on a fried wonton shell and served like a tostada $2 for one and was told $1 during happy hour.. Definitely worth it...happy hour it off and try one of each (there's a few more on the menu) Big eye tuna poki- literally a poke salad (would have preferred big eye tuna sashimi) Yellowtail Yuzu Soy-  delicious appetizers and served in thin sashimi pieces Salmon Wasabi Creme-  served in thin sashimi pieces but the Creme was a little off.  Seemed like wasabi flavored Creme cheese. Mix Sashimi 12 pcs- overall the sashimi is very fresh and beautifully presented (posted a pic of it) California Roll-  only ordered this because it was served with real king crab King Crab Salad- not worth it for $15 opt for the California roll instead  The owner and chef came over to introduce himself and even sent over complimentary uni (picture posted)- which was of course fresh and delectable!  This is probably going to be a new place for everyone to come back to.  We will be back for happy hour when we visit again!  After we had the food their hiccup in the beginning changed their review.  Hopefully they keep up with the quality of the food!",

I'm considering myself lucky to be amongst the first set of patrons.   I have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word, starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)  Unreal! These prices are too good to be True... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running, not walking, to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.    Took some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park!   Some things that I recommend trying are:  Ty Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)  SOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)  Beef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite, pictured.)  Rock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeno aioli and the sweet banana sesame)  Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)  Soft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite, pictured)  Creme Brulee (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double, she knows all about it! *wink*)  If there's something you usually order that is not on the menu, ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not.   I would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself, Mr. John Lee, came out to welcome us. He made us feel like True VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best.   I have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire, mark my words!   I'm eating there again tonight. Yep, it is THAT good!  Update: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently, one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease. Chef John Lee hooked up many options for her. My guests were so impressed! Thanks Soho Japanese Restaurant and John Lee for all the extra special things that you do.",

    "text": "Love it, love it, love it!  Soho is indeed a hidden gem located beside Chevron gas station along S. Jones cor Warm Springs.  My hubby and I are sushi fanatics who continuously search for a good sushi place.  Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, we tried Soho Japanese Restaurant for lunch and we were not disappointed.  Sometimes, yelp reviewers miss the mark, but this time they were spot on.   We ordered the salmon and tuna tostada for appetizers.  The freshness of the fish which was perfectly seasoned (excellent blend of citrus, salt and oil) got me hooked at first bite.  The wasabi cream was smeared on the crunchy, flaky tostada, the salmon and tuna were topped with fresh herb that had a similar taste to cilantro/parsley which gave the concoction a refreshing twist.    At this point, the chef/owner, John approached our table to introduce himself.  He was a very likeable guy who obviously wanted his customer/guest to be happy with the food selection.  He offered us a delicate dish of Hamachi layered on top of a mixture of garlic infused grape seed oil with hint of shoyu and topped with mild sliced jalapeno.  Again, perfection!  This was only topped by the fact that it was complimentary!  John surely knows how to woo his customers, and it definitely worked.  I had the rainbow roll which was equally good.  The sushi rice was cooked and seasoned just right and of course, the fish, shrimp and crab eggs were quite fresh.  Hubby wanted a chirashi bowl, but it was not on the menu.  They had a sashimi item on the lunch special menu but no chirashi.  However, because John was so gracious and accommodating, he made it happen for my hubby who was very happy and satisfied with his choice.  The service at Soho was fast and friendly, a worthy companion to the exceptional sushi creations.    We will definitely be back for happy hour (4-6pm, Mon-Sat) with friends who would definitely love this place as well. Thank you chef John and Louie, our attentive  server.  We will see you soon.",

    "text": "I don't normally leave Yelp reviews, but when I do it's for what I call Table Pounder food!!!   We came here wanting to try something different than the normal AYCE places.   The cold dishes were really the spotlight of the menu. We tried the Yellowtail Yuzu and Ume Scallop.  I fell in LOVE with sashimi scallop in Austin and have been on a hunt in Vegas ever since. This is the first restaurant I've found that had scallop and it was a table pounder!!! So fresh and delicious. I love the texture of scallop because it isn't like the normal fish that kind of melts in your mouth. It has this harder chewiness to it (best I can describe is Filipino pineapple jelly but a little softer)  For those who have never tried scallop, this is a must!  We wanted to try the entire cold menu but will come back for that. We also had some of the tostadas (shrimp and whitefish) which were also really good.  For dessert you cannot go wrong with the matcha tiramisu. The matcha flavor was good and it was super creamy just how I like it.  Best part of the night was having the chef come out to the table.  Chef John was very personable and you could feel the passion he had for his restaurant by the way he spoke of it. He also offered us a cold dish on the house of some special trout (can't remember the name) but it was similar to salmon and sooo good!   We missed the specials because it was at the front of the restaurant and we couldn't see the sign. I mentioned it to him that the waiters didn't let us know and he said that he didn't want his patrons to feel like they were upselling us. I thought that was quite admirable but gave him a recommendation to move the specials where more people could see it because we probably would have ordered off of it. He said that he would take that into account and welcomed all recommendations.   Not only was the food good but the chef really makes the place. It's only been opened for three months but seems to be doing well. I would definitely recommend this place. Not only for the food but the chef as well. He's the type of person that you hope has much success!!!",

The Happy Hour menu is by far the best I have seen in Las Vegas. Great sushi rolls and sashimi dishes for just $5. Sapporo draft beer for only $3. Outstanding dishes we tried were the Cajun Albacore Sashimi, Salmon Carpaccio, Salmon Avocado Creme, Fire Cracker Rool, and Seafood Dynamite Roll. The counter service was super friendly and it was fun to watch the guys do their craft. We should have tried this place much sooner. Can't wait to go back for dinner service. If you are visiting from out of town get off the strip and run to this place.",

    "text": "I'm not local, I'm actually a tourist in Vegas.  I found this place from my friend's Facebook photo album.  They are foodie and highly recommend this place, thus we decided to pay a visit while we are in town during Thanksgiving weekend.  The first impression when we walked in- friendly staffs, nice & clean open kitchen, cozy atmosphere.    We knew we were in for a good experience when we could tell that the place was filled with locals.  There were families, large groups and couples and all looked like they were having a wonderful time.  Now let's get to the main point of focus:  THE FOOD!  WOW!  Simply THE BEST!!!  Everything was FRESH and DELICIOUS.  You could taste the freshness and the quality of the ingredients with every bite.  On top of it, all the prices were very reasonable, especially for this area.  Hello~ we are in Veags, baby!  If you are willing to pay more $$$ on the strip, by all mean!  This is not a fancy restaurant with 3 servers standing next to you.  This place is cozy, family owned, with Michelin starred restaurant quality.   I sincerely think the quality I'm getting vs. what I paid for, it's totally under-priced.          I found a local magazine quoted this newly opened restaurant \"Nearly Perfect\"!!!  wow~      This place is a hidden gem in the neighborhood.   I want to keep this as special secret, yet I also want to shout from the rooftops.    I even came eat here twice in a row within 3 days.  That's rare for me to do!    I hope that next time when I visit, it won't be a long line...   Thank you Soho & Chef John Lee for giving us such a memorable dining experience - we will definitely be back next time when we are in town!  Or...maybe we will come back shortly just to dine here again..",

    "text": "Super good. Nice servers. I was really craving sushi when I came in here. And when I say sushi... I mean 5 star 'katsuya Hollywood/ Sherman oaks' type sushi and sushimi.   I'm not a huge lover of rolls, I always prefer sashimi. I ended up trying this place because any place I lived close to had terrible reviews and this didn't seem too far.   I ended up driving about 15 minutes... It is pretty far from southern highlands. And I went solo. I had planned to get some work done... But it was pretty busy the week night I went and the hostess took about 10 minutes to acknowledge me, then another 10 to seat me. I'm not docking them for this... Because it was super busy and the wait sign was a bit confusing.   I was sat at the sushi bar. My server came up quickly to take my order and I got yellow tail sashimi and a water. The sushi bar chef came right up and took over my order and experience. Extremely personable... Made what I was waiting for right there and gave me another 2$ appetizer which gives you about 6 fresh selections to come on a thin crispy wonton with avocado and fresh cilantro. I want to say I order a yellow tail or tuna and this was by far the best and most refreshing thing I ordered. In total I ordered this, yellowtail sashimi which gave like 6-7 BIG pieces and some tuna dish.   The only area I could tell them to improve is the vibe between my sushi bar server and my actual waiter. Because I ended up tipping my server the standar 20% and tipping the sushi chef 20% in cash because I didn't know who received what. The sushi bar chefs were a lively bunch and handled everything from that point... And once my server let me sit when I was waiting to cash out... The sushi bar guy handled it.   Portions. I am an athletic female who is tall, and I can eat at times. I came in extremely starving and could only eat 3 bites of the yellow tail, 2/6 bites of my tuna and one of the crudo wonton apps I ordered. I ended up giving the rest of my untouched meal to a lovely couple sitting next to me... Who no joke had about 8 dishes and hadn't even had their main dinner yet.. And they were smaller than me. True sushi fans who I briefly spoke to.. They had nothing but great things to say of the place... And the chef continued sending them other free items.. Something I just noticed. I really appreciated that they gladly accepted my left overs and dug right in!! (I have good taste... No all you can eat rolls here!).   I am a rare sushi eater that craves higher end sashimis mixed with other fress ingredients. I'm not a huge fan of the all you can eat buffets of tired rolls that are all over town... So if this place serves something like that.. I am just unaware because I just prefer sashimi plates.   Hope this helps. No place is EVER going to be perfect... But the food was good enough, the atmosphere good enough and my experience good enough to give them a 5 star review because I would highly recommend the place to all sushi lovers!!!!!",

    "text": "Me and my husband found this place on yelp since I was looking for a new Japanese restaurant to eat at during our anniversary week. We looked at some of the pictures on here too to see what we can expect. And I must say, they didn't let us down! The fishes were all exceptional quality! The FLAVORS..??? To die for!!! And for the price, it was surprisingly reasonable considering the food was the same, if not better, quality than Andrea's at Encore hotel. The owner and the servers were really nice and friendly. The servers were very knowledgable as well when it comes to the components of the dishes. The owner was thoughtful enough to come to our table and ask us what we particularly liked in our food and recommended certain things to us that I absolutely loved!!!  I definitely recommend ordering the yellowtail hamachi, seared beef hamachi, the ocean trout special, Japanese snapper with uni ponzu, fresh uni, shishito peppers, tuna poke tostada and miso black cod..  I highly recommend trying this place out and trust me you will be hooked! I know I am and my friends will be too soon after I take them there!",

We sat at the sushi bar and were given the option to order from the menu or leave it up to the chef.  Was a little reluctant after leaving it to the Sushi Chef in Vancouver once which turned out to be a bad and expensive experience but I did it anyways.  We had several courses of amazing shashimi with sauces, cooksed fish, rolls, and then even amazing desserts.  I would have to say this was the best sushi I have had and the price was very good for this amazing meal.  Significantly lower than the strip.  The chef/owner was very nice and appreciative of our business.  Can't wait to go back.  Jeff",

All the Nigri and sushi rolls tasted heavenly and not heavy on the rice, which is a plus. Scallops with Foie gras is the best dish to me. Chef John Lee still there and cooks great food. My server was Charlie and she gave great service. You must try everything especially the desert, creme brulee and green tea tiramisu.

Over the course of the meal we ordered two Lychee Sake's ($4 ea.) to share and one beer $1.50 (for me). We thoroughly enjoyed tuna tostadas and at $1 ea. who can beat that?! we also enjoyed the black cod $4 (YUM), Cajun Albacore Sashimi $5 (double YUM) and the baked mussels (a bit chewy for me but my PIC enjoyed them) :)  not to mention the extremely attentive and friendly staff who were a pleasure to be around and never rushed us as we were there for hours!  We left with a split bill - both under $40 out-the-door. Left STUFFED; I loved this place... definitely recommend it and look forward to my return with the hubby next time. :)",

But this visit was different - we found Soho and fell in love.  Both of us felt it was the best overall Japanese meal we've ever had.  Each of the dishes we ordered - and I'd have to say there were really too many - were superb. The highlights - the salmon and the whitefish sashimi and the Twin Dragon Roll.  There are simply too many good things to say about each of the dishes but suffice to say, it was the best.  The service matched the food - terrifically casual, friendly and knowledgeable server with the willingness to let us know what she liked as well as what was popular.  We took her suggestions and were ecstatic!  I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant - get there soon before they move up and out because they definitely deserve to.",
