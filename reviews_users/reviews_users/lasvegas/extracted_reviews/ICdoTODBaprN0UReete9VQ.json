    "text": "FB asks the question, what do I recommend at Big B's Texas BBQ and I answer with \"EVERYTHING\" on the menu.  My friends and I ran across this restaurant over this past weekend and found it to be the VERY BEST BBQ we have ever eaten.  We walked in and immediately were smacked in the face with the aroma of the smoky wood.  From there, it was FOOD ON and let me tell you, after we ate, we wanted to take a nap on the benches and wait for the dinner hour to roll around.  We ended up ordering the tri-trip, brisket, beef ribs (that reminded of my childhood) and the baby back ribs.  We could taste the smokiness with each bite, the meat was super tender, and might I say, \"hats off\" to whoever created your Mustard BBQ sauce.  Oh my god, this sauce took me over the edge.  Full of flavor and at a bit sneaky with the heat.  Loved It!  We chose mac n cheese, pasta salad and the baked beans as our sides and by far, the best we have ever eaten.  The mac n cheese has REAL CHEESE in it as opposed to the standard Velveta Cheese sauce and pasta.  The pasta salad was perfectly coated and it didn't swim in the dressing.  Saving the best for last...as the BAKED BEANS blew our minds...we guessed 3 different kinds of beans were used, along with garlic, little bits of meat, and bbq sauce.  Genius! They are generous with their portions and the staff is so very friendly and helpful.  To the owner of Big B's, I am now a huge fan and I thank you for bringing your \"A-Game\" to the BBQ World.  You rocked it, knocked it, right out of my ball park and I look forward to introducing my friends and family to your restaurant.",

We had the three piece combo.,.. double tri-tip and chicken   even though it is excellent the only thing disappointing thing is no one gives you half a chicken anymore.  It was only a thigh and leg (attached).   I would definitely recommend them to everyone",

    "text": "Real TX bbq y'all.  Meat is not drowned in sauce, simply smoked with a flavorful rub and the True nuance of the meat shows thru.   Food: 4  Ambiance: 4  Service: 4  Value: 3    We ordered: Brisket (wet) Tri-tip Ribs Mac n chz  Beans Potato salad  Brisket is the best I've had in in Vegas. Moist tender and seasoned perfectly - very light, allowing the brisket flavor to shine. No sauce needed.   Tri tip was good, a little more firm/dry in texture than the brisket but the flavor was spot on. Used a little of the sweet bbq sauce on this one.   Ribs. Omg the ribs. They totally brought me back to tx and my favorite little hole in the wall spot. Fall off the bone tender with just the right amount of crispy outside crust. Meat was juicy and the seasoning was on point. Absolutely no sauce needed.   Mac n chz was eh. Blah. For sure not a favorite and won't order again. It had a weird watery appearance (like it was being stretched with water or milk) and had no flavor. I didn't like the Mac but there are lots out there that do  Beans were great. It had a sweet and sour thing happening that I loved. They reminded me of charro beans. Down side is my bowl had nothing but beans in it, no bark no meat no peppers and I see some pics here that do. Oh well. It was still yum.   Potato salad was good. Better than others out there. Not too mustardy or too salty.   Lunch for me and hubs (no sodas just water) came to $38 - a little high but we did have some leftovers to take home. Take note - there are plenty of upcharges here, be aware when placing your order.   The only down side is they don't serve real TX sweet tea. Tx BBQ and sweet tea go hand in hand.   Will definitely return when the craving for ribs and brisket comes up",

I've had the pulled pork, brisket, tri-tip, baby back ribs, and chicken. All have been good, but the pulled pork is my favorite. (There are a couple I haven't tried yet).  Most of the menu items come with choice of sides. My favorites here are the potato salad, BBQ beans, Mac and cheese, and cream corn.  This is better-than-average BBQ at reasonable prices, with large servings. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's quite good. Definitely worth the cost.",

We got pork ribs, brisket, babyback ribs and beef ribs, and we were very happy with what we got for the cost. To say the beef ribs were huge would be an understatement; they were ginormous. Very juicy, tender, and flavorful even without any sauce. We asked for the brisket to have a little more moisture so it wouldn't be dry and it was delicious and juicy. The pork ribs were also amazing. The sauces were great also. We got spicy one, a sweet tasting one, and a mustard kind of sauce. Our favorite was the spicy - not too sweet, and the perfect amount of spice. They were all seasoned perfectly and the place itself seemed nice as well. It took awhile for the food to get to us but it was well worth the wait. After a single rib or two each the whole family was full. Would reccomend to anyone who likes a good bbq joint.",

I even found out we were able to get a free side with a check-in so that made me happy. After ordering I noticed the prices weren't very cheap but wanted to get a beer anyway to enjoy my night off. After tipping, cashing out, & waiting about 10 minutes, our food came. I immediately noticed my meat was soaked in oil. My boyfriends brisket was great & he enjoyed it. The mac&cheese was good, a little too cheesy like I was just eating cheese sauce some of the time. I really liked the beans, they had a nice smoky, bbq flavor & were a little spicy. I couldn't get over that greasy ass pork, I didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe it was the last of the batch, or they didn't bother to drain it or something but it was awful & a little salty too. I also enjoyed my draft Blue Moon. Next time I will try the chicken or ribs.",

It says \" BBQ Chicken wings with fries and drink\", we also wanted to order sliders but the woman who was taking our order stated that there aren't a lot of meat on the sliders and it basically gave us the vibe that it was not a good choice. We changed our order to a brisket po boy instead. However, I feel that if the employees are pushing you away from a certain order, that item has to change.  The wings came out 15 minutes later, my girlfriend was done eating her po boy. I basically watched her eat and she watched me eat afterwards. It would have been better if they brought out both entrees at the same time. Also, the wings were not BBQ, they were just plain fried chicken wings. Although, there was a BBQ sauce on the table, so I drenched it in that. The fries came out fresh and crispy which was delicious.  I would also add that the menu is not easy to understand for people who do not eat bbq at a regular basis. I was not aware of the up charges on different meats that was not stated in their combo meals, I would of thought the meat quantity would have been adjusted to accommodate the combo price.  Anyways, the food is still good.. Could use some work here and there especially in the menu area.",

We ordered the 3 meat plate with brisket, 1/2 slab of ribs and pulled pork.  I wanted hot links but they weren't ready yet.  The plate comes with 2 sides, we chose mac n cheese, baked beans and added a side of coleslaw.  Meat was cooked perfect.  Brisket was moist and tender.  Ribs and pulled pork were excellent.  They have 2 housemade bbq sauces.  One is mustard based and the other ketchup based.  Both have great flavor.  We loved all the sides.  Especially the mac n cheese.  They use 4 cheeses and smoke it for an hour.  It was to die for.  So good that at the end of our meal when we overheard the hot links were ready we got a hot link and more mac and cheese to take home for later.  They have a coke freestyle machine and iced tea, soon they will have sweet tea.  It was early on opening day and there were a few kinks, POS was down, cash only, only partial menu was available but no biggie.  All that will work itself out.  Service was great.  Everyone was very friendly.  Can't wait to go back!",

I am very picky with my BBQ and am not ashamed to say that I will speak up when I eat bad Q, this is LEGIT Q!!!   I ordered the 3 meat plate with 2 sides.  Tri Tip- moist, perfectly smoked, tender and melted in my mouth.  Brisket- asked for the cap (fatty side). The guy taking my order went out of his way to make sure I got what I was asking for. Perfect smoke ring, so juicy and full of flavor.  Pulled Pork- This is where I am super picky, pulled pork is a specialty of mine. Let me say that this did not disappoint!! Once again, great flavor, juicy and perfectly smoked.  Mac-n-cheese- this is the way Mac is supposed to be cooked, trust me it won't let ya down!  Beans- beans were good but not my favorite but I didn't complain one bit as I was shoveling them in my mouth! Haha I am more of a sweet baked bean fan.  Sauces- Both sauces are great but I am a no sauce type of Q fan and the meal didn't need sauce, the food stands alone with great flavor!  They do it up real at this gem, cutting meats and serving sides right in front of you, just like the big boy Q joints in Texas.",

Tried 3 meats: tri tip, smoked turkey, and the best brisket I have had in years. Sauce in bottles on the table, where it ought to be,  not on the meat. Really nice sized servings.  Sides are very accomplished; nice coleslaw with a hint of mayo and not soaked in it, outstanding Mac and cheese, and fries that easily rival Five Guys.  Took some home made apple pie home. Willing to bet that's good too. We'll be back!",

    "text": "Tucked away behind Raising Cane's, the Las Vegas Weekly write-up piqued my interest to finally try this place. We came in shortly after 11 am for lunch, which is early. I ordered a two-meat plate, and my boyfriend ordered a 1-meat plate. We each got a fountain drink. Lunch with tip came out to over $30 (which was kind of steep for the quantity/quality we got).  I ordered pulled pork and chicken, with mac and cheese and fries. We had a bit of a wait for the french fries because the fryer hadn't heated up enough yet, but when they dropped on the table, they were so worth it - very tasty. The mac had a texture and tasted like it had been reheated, so I was disappointed in that. The pulled pork was good, but the chicken was a little flavorless.  My boyfriend got the tri tips, cole slaw and beans, all of which he said were okay. Not the best he'd ever had, but good. The portion size on the tri tips was a little small, especially in comparison to my pork and gigantic chicken.  The space has a ton of picnic tables that are very cute, and had community dining in mind. We were one of multiple one- and two-person dining parties. The restaurant could benefit from putting in a few two-person tables so they don't have a single person taking up a four-person table when it gets busy (because some people just don't like to sit down with folks they don't know.)",

I was told by the employee that took my order that they just had a pretty big rush about an hour ago.  I opted for the 1 meat plate and I chose the brisket. It comes with two sides and I was recommended the baked beans. I chose that as well as the creamed corn. Both sides were excellent. The brisket was good, basically cut into small pieces and put on a round serving dish. I did have to use quite a bit of the sauce that was on the table because I felt there wasn't enough flavor. I love pulled pork so I think I'm going to try that next time I come in. There were quite a few people that came in after me. It's always a good sign when a new establishment is busy. I also liked the music they play here... Good 'ol country...but then again you can't listen to anything else while eating BBQ now, can you? I'll be back!!",

They give a piece of sliced white bread with your meal. Which was nice but kind of bleh. Would've been better if it came with cornbread. Or even like a Texas toast maybe? Idk. BBQ sauces were good too but they only had 2 kinds. Reg house made BBQ and a house made mustard BBQ.  Ribs fell off the bone and the hot link sausage was bomb!

The sides are pretty good but the meat is what shines. They also serve beer and wine. I have not gotten catering but they offer it and you get pretty good deals on large orders. They have combo plates too and you can get multiple meats. However, I'd recommend going in a group and getting a lot of variety and then trying everything. You can tell they care a lot about their product.",

    "text": "My fiance found this place on Yelp, by chance.  So, we thought we'd check it out.    Walking in was different than most places since you walk along a corridor to the order window before taking your slip to the cashier.  Kind of like a cafeteria.    We didn't know how to order so we used pictures from Yelp to help guide us.  Thankfully, though, we didn't really need this as the girl who took our order really made it easy for us by explaining the menu and even made a few recommendations.  Which we liked.   The food came out pretty fast.  But I was more impressed by our server (the same girl who took our order). She explained everything on our tray to us and then explained the different sauces.  She even came back a few minutes later to check on us and to see if we liked her recommendations.    I thought the food was pretty good.  All of the different meats were super tender and juicy. They didn't have much flavor but that's why the sauces are important to have.    Overall, we will definitely be back. And even though our girl was very nice and customer service oriented, the overall energy of the staff was very positive.  The only other interaction we had was with the cashier and she was pleasant.",

There were even people coming in right at closing and they were still so friendly! I really like how how they have all the condiments at every table. It's very useful!  We decided to get the one meat plate and also the slider plate. Both options come with two sides. We also used the free side when you check in. For our plate we got ribs, which was an extra $5 up charge to the plate. The sides we got for this plate were beans, fries, and mac and cheese. The ribs were pretty good, but I think I would have rather gotten a meat option that didn't have the extra $5, didn't seem as worth it to me. I was a huge fan of the mac and cheese. Even when I was full, I made sure there was no mac left behind!   The sliders were good. You pick your meat. We were able to get three different options so we were able to try all kinds of sliders! It's an assemble yourself type slider, but it's helpful so you can add all the sauce you want!   All in all, I'll definitely be back again, hopefully a whole lot hungrier.",

So being that we didn't have anything close to a place like that here, this place was a MUST TRY when we heard about it.  Me and my family (of 5) went there for lunch today. Heard from a friend that their moist brisket was similar to Rudy's, we just had to order more than enough so we would have leftovers. Yes, it is MOIST & tender and oh-so-good! The beef ribs were meh. I saw the beef ribs were individually wrapped with plastic wrap and they looked cold. Seems like they put them on the grill to warm through so I was not impressed with that. Is that how Bbq joints do them? It did definitely have that smoked flavor I did like though. The creamed corn was okay. Guess because I was expecting it to be similar to Rudy's too but it wasn't even close. It was a little on the salty side too. The fried okra & fries were delicious and I really liked the Bbq sauce!  Sorry but I had to deduct the 1 star for the beef ribs but Overall this is a GREAT Bbq place. Love the setup of the restaurant, staff was very friendly, and the food was really good. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "There's a lot to like about this place starting with a great looking interior that sets the stage for some great BBQ. The rustic/down-home feel is everywhere -- from the picket fence to the wooden picnic tables to the old license plates hanging up everywhere. And, in case you didn't know the owner is from Texas, you will after seeing all the Texas gear and longhorn symbols (as well as an A&M flag) on the walls.  In the center of the room is a stack of wood that they use to smoke their BBQ. If you look into the open kitchen you'll see the smoker at work. The barbecue it produces is some of the better stuff in the valley. The brisket, in particular, is exceptional. Charred edges, a noticeable smoke ring that's also apparent upon tasting it, and tender enough to cut with a plastic spoon. It shouldn't be missed. Baby back ribs are dry rubbed and smoked and have a fantastic bark coating the exterior of the fall-off-the-bone meat. The pulled pork is solid, too. Although I needed to drizzle some sauce on it. Their sauce has a mild kick that will linger in the back of your palate. The corn bread was only ok, and the creamed corn wasn't as thick as I prefer, but still decent.  With Big B's and Bell's BBQ, Henderson has some tasty options when you're craving BBQ.",

The ribs are killer,total Austin style,the only problem is there is a $5 up charge on ribs,so if you want a dinner plate with baby backs and beef ribs it's  $10 above the regular price.Dont get me wrong there delish,but who wants to pay like $4 a rib?",

I've been to bbq restaurants where they slather their bbq sauce on the meats. Not Big B's. The brisket was the best that I've ever had. So natural in flavor and moist. We also ordered pulled pork, jalapeno cheese sausage, baby back ribs and smoked turkey breast. They all were so tasty!! My kids loved the sausage and ribs. Big B's offers bbq sauce and a mustard sauce on the side for the meats if so desired. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it with the meats because I usually don't like bbq sauce. This place is definitely my go-to American barbecue cravings.",

Staff was far from friendly. The guy taking orders didnt greet us just asked us what he wanted and grew impatient real quick. He was pretty much a jerk and thats it. The food was ok but the service and staff was far from desirable.   Good service will outshine bad food an6 day of the week, however shit service and a jerk staff will not make up for average or slightly better bbq.",

Juicy and tender, you don't even need to dip it in any sauce. Although, their bbq sauce (regular and spicy) are both flavorful with a hint of tang. Their Mac and cheese and bbq beans are really good sides that compliments the meats.   For dessert, their apple pie! Don't skip the apple pie! I don't know what they put in it but it is delish.   Definitely recommend! A+++++",

Every side baked beans, potatoe salad, cream corn, corn on the cob, cole slaw, pasta salad, fried okra was home made and fresh just like mama\"s. Also had smoked chicken which was delicious.

    "text": "Decided to finally try this BBQ restaurant in Henderson.   We ordered the family meal with chicken and pulled pork.  The meal included 2 large sides and we ordered slaw and creamed corn, and paid an extra $1.50 for 2 cornbread muffins.   First the good stuff...the pulled pork and included buns.  Excellent, juicy and good.  The cole slaw wasn't too bad.   The rest was not that great.  The creamed corn was a little chewy.  The chicken was very dry, we didn't want to eat it even when we took it home, and the corn bread was awful.  I like most cornbread, but this was very sweet, so we also didn't finish eating it either.     The meal cost us $40, a little high, but because we didn't finish the food, it was way too expensive.  I normally give restaurants high marks and wish I could here too.",

The baked beans are so rich and delicious, I can not get them into my mouth fast enough.i would stop in for bake beans alone. Too good to pass up.

They only use salt and pepper for their seasoning so it enhances the flavor a little bit without complicating it too much. We were also informed that the owner personally drives over to Texas to pick up wood for smoking his meats. Talk about dedication.   I loved their brisket, super lean but also really moist and tender. Their hot links were solid along with the spare ribs, beef ribs, and the turkey. We also tried their loaded potato skins, and those were the perfect complement to our meats. Pro tip: If you like spicy sauces, ask for their \"yelp sauce.\" It's like a hot bbq sauce with ghost peppers mixed in, and it's so good with their meats.   Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items!",

This unfortunately was not my favorite  kind of barbecue. It's not terrible but not what I could consider coming back for.   I tried their specialty sandwich which had pulled pork, brisket and  a hotlink topped with some coleslaw sandwiched between a tasted bun. I overheard them say they only season with salt and pepper and some people are into that I personally like a little bit more seasoning and I actually ended up adding more salt. The table barbecue sauce was just okay but their mustard sauce helped, but just after a few bites I was pretty much done.  Our sides consisted of fried okra, creamed corn, potato salad, and macaroni and cheese. The creamed corn tasted straight out of the can the fried okra didn't have much taste but the mac and cheese was pretty good.  The place is nice very large with wooden picnic benches and apparently they bring their firewood all the way from Texas. Texas is known for a lot of things barbecue tops the list so I'll be on the hunt once again in search for some Texas BBQ.",

    "text": "The smell alone is worth the visit. Good smokey mesquite smell, flavor and taste.  This place is real BBQ, slow cooked over mesquite and full of smokey flavor.  Hell, I'd eat here every day if The Boss would let me.  In my house there is 1 Boss . . . and I'm not it.    I am a BBQ nut and The Boss doesn't eat meat, so naturally we came to a BBQ joint.  1st time in and we were both very pleased.  I had the brisket (perfect), chicken (very tasty but small yardbirds) and link (all beef, long and good).  The food is excellent, mouthwatering, smokey good taste.   I ordered the mac and cheese (really good) and the bbq beans which were not my favorite.  They were more like a Brunswick Stew flavor then BBQ beans, but still tasty.  I'd explore the sides a bit more next trip in.  They have 1 BBQ sauce, and it's got a great flavor to it,  but really, the meat is better all by itself.  The Boss had a big ass salad (no meat) that was plenty filling.  We followed the meal up with slices of Apple Pie.  I don't know where the pie originated, but it was perfect.  The service was great, engaged,and the staff wanted you to taste before ordering and wanted you pleased. Really a great crew.  Portions are good and there is a value for the dollar you spend.  We can commend this place and its food and staff to you, and would urge you to give it a try if you like good smokey tasty BBQ!",

    "text": "Went here for the first time last weekend with my girlfriend.  I'm not sure how many of you have been to Phil's BBQ in San Diego but the way ordering is, is similar to theirs.  You first walk in, walk up to the counter and order your food, receive a receipt, and proceed to the cash register to order your drink (if wanted) and pay for your meal.  You receive a number and they bring the food out to your table when it's ready.  I ordered the 3 meat combo, and chose chicken, brisket and tri-tip.  It comes with a choice of 2 sides (I chose macaroni and cheese and a corn on the cob) and an additional side (I chose french fries) at no charge if you check-in on Yelp (don't forget!).  My girlfriend had ordered the 1 meat combo, and chose the 1/2 slab of ribs and for her 2 sides she picked a corn on the cob and corn bread.  My meats were all delicious, tender, and flavorful.  I do suggest you use their sauce (looks like bbq sauce) provided on the tables with your meat, it makes it taste 100x better.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious as well.  The rib meat fell off the bones beautifully.  The ribs lack some flavor so I feel that it's mandatory to put the sauce on them.  The cornbread is by far my favorite part of the meal.  Its texture and taste is amazing.    Parking is plentiful so no issue there.  The service is good as well, all of the workers are very friendly and helpful.  Inside seating is spaced out and there's plenty of spots.  The decor is cute.  I would go back again.",

While the owners of Big B's were unknown to me until our second visit, the smell of a authentic BBQ is like a warm, aromatic hug accompanied by a soft, determined whisper, 'Let's eat'.  My wife and I pulled Natalia aside - we guessed correctly that she was the Co-owner.  Having sold to full service restaurants in the past, you can quickly tell the difference by the way the owners genuinely care for their customers.  Her husband is a towering figure - his giant presence is living breathing proof that they grow 'em big in Texas. He and Natalia are a perfect couple who bring their joy of BBQ to this little corner of Las Vegas and it shows in True Texan fashion.  Natalia explained.  Original BBQ doesn't cut corners.  Their briskets smoke for 12-14 hours overnight.  Only fresh meat, only seasoned rub - no marinade, and Texas mesquite.  Every few months they drive to Texas to haul cords of genuine Texas mesquite back to B's adoptive home of 20 years.    If you love BBQ, go here.  They don't advertise.  They don't need to.  This place is packed.  Friday nights, their special are the beef ribs.  Go early - they run out quickly to high demand.  This is a no joke, best of the best",

Looks can be deceiving, as we walked up the place looked tiny and like a little local restaurant. Wrong, this place was huge! Walking through the doors, the smells of smoked meats, spices and just goodness fills the nostrils and waters the mouth! The layout is a huge area with like 15 large picnic tables, some round tables with umbrellas and some smaller size picnic tables. Pretty open though.  The menu is pretty simple, lots of choices and reasonably priced. We went with the 2 meat combo which came with two sides.  The portions are just outrageous.

The BBQ meat makes this place and the I recommend it. Even without the house sauce it still great. But why not add it. It's on every table.

Items tried: Brisket Tri-tip Mac n cheese Creamed corn Baked beans Potato salad  I preferred the tri-tip over the brisket in the flavor department, but I appreciated the tenderness of the brisket. The meat was kind of dry side and absolutely needed sauce. I was a bit disappointed that the tables offered only one kind of BBQ sauce.  It wasn't bad, just didn't have the wow factor. The mustard sauce at the table was tasty, but didn't really go with the meats we had.   The sides were pretty good. I liked the baked beans the best and the creamed corn the least.   I'm glad I got to finally try this place since I was nearby for an appointment. It was the most reasonable fast, casual food option that didn't have a drive thru in the immediate area. I will have to tackle on the pork options at a next visit. Looking forward to some ribs, pulled pork, and hot links!   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 31/100",

This time, my son and I ordered:  1.  Tri Tip 2.  Beef Link 3.  Brisket - Moist Cut 4.  Half Chicken.  The experience this time was absolutely awesome.  The Tri-Tip was so tender and juicy moist. I had asked the order taker if he recommended the Tri-Tip of the pulled pork.  Thankfully, I listened to him and it was the best.   The moist cut Brisket was so tender. I really think it is the best in LV.  I stopped using fork and knife and went all hands as it was the best way to eat this stuff, faster than my son...  The chicken is the dark meat, leg and thigh.  So juicy and the meat is perfect as it falls off the bone.  The Beef Link had the right amount of spicy kick to it and I am glad I ordered it as I always wanted to try it.  Service was great, food was great and I am glad that they have their greatness back.  GK says, definitely go back.  The best thing was, i ordered all this at the end of the day toward closing and all the food was perfect, juicy, tender and moist.  So glad I came back here!",

    "text": "Big B's Texas BBQ has some huge meaty portions however it lacks flavor and their BBQ sauce is watery and also like their meat lacks flavor. They are pretty pricey, but due to the large portions it kind of makes you feel like you are getting your money's worth. For the sides I tried their mac and cheese, bbq beans, and french fries which all tasted pretty good. I got the ultimate bbq sandwich which was monstrous, meaty, and reasonable price. Their potato skins are actually decent with the exception of the beans that goes on top which negatively impacted the taste, which were also pretty pricey. Again the main issue for me with Big B's is their BBQ sauce, if I brought some different bbq sauce to add to the meat it would bring this place up 2 stars.",

The brisket is a second best though it is missing the mesquite that I'm used to from back home in Chicago.   I love the openness of the dining area and the sturdy lacquered picnic tables. If you want a laid back mid-level hangout the place is also packed with flat screens, mostly playing sports.  As for sides, the fried okra deep-fried because it was a little soft but the mac was the business!!!  Fairly priced and awesome bro staff!",

The manager was very nice and quick to replace them, the second ones we could chew and we did eat about half but they were totally flavorless, no smoke taste, no seasonings that I could taste, could have been cooked in the oven!! We also had brisket and it was ok!  Tender, but really no smoke ring, no smoke flavor!  We've had a lot of Texas BBQ and if they really use mesquite they must have run out or they only smoke it for a little while cuz there is no flavor in the meat we had!! Should have listened to the negative reviews cuz they were all right on!! So disappointing!!",

We could barely smell the meat cooking outside of the door, unlike famous Dave's, you can smell their barbecue. The tri tip & brisket were very tender, but it lacked flavor. The barbecue sauce was ok, but it was that watery kind of sauce. You need a lot of it on the food to appreciate your meal. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for their food, especially not their cornbread, but it is very very clean.",

So I'm googling bbq places for my wife's birthday & I come across Big B's Texas BBQ & I think this is probably some fake imitation Texas bbq restaurant but I say what the hell let's try it at a risk since it's my significant others birthday. So we drive out there & I say to myself this place don't look much like a Texas bbq place so I go inside & to my amazement a man around 7 foot tall greets us at the door. This giant Texan gave us the warmest welcome that iv ever received since leaving Texas & proceeded to give us the tour & treat us like family. I noticed a familiar smell as I walked by shelves full of Texas mesquite wood the owner himself drives down to Las Vegas from Somerset Texas. Upon further inspection I realized that I was surrounded by everything I loved about Texas & the atmosphere made me feel so at home that I wanted to cry. But now came the best part ,the food. I thought I'd died & went to bbq heaven, the most mouth watering smoked meats that iv ever had & a huge helping of delicious sides. So that was my wife's Birthday & she loved it. Last night was my birthday & nothing else came to mind but Big B's Texas BBQ, this time my family was greeted by a woman that knew exactly what southern hospitality was all about, she made my birthday better than I could have ever expected. The food was fast, hot, & better than ever. When they say things are bigger in Texas they ain't playin around. I was surrounded by a feast of my favorite Texas foods. I had Dinosaur size beef ribs, brisket that was so Tender that I could not even pick it up without it falling apart, a pile of hot French fries, a bucket of steamy Mack & cheese, fresh cornbread, some real sweet tea & a large variety of delicious sauces. But there was something else about this food that I forgot about which  is the love & time that goes into home made food like this. I loved my experience at Big B's Texas BBQ & it's my new home away from home. My only regret is that I left without tasting their home made pecan pie! This place did make my wife cry last night as my Daughter is deployed in the Navy out in Bahrain & this place reminded her of our little girl so much that she couldn't hold back. My Daughter loved this place when we came for my wife's birthday! Thank you guys for being so kind & passionate about bringing Texas food here to Las Vegas.",

People are right about the size of the place, it's huge. It's got a fun atmosphere and decent customer service. However the food is comparable to dickies at best and at twice the price. I'm not sure how they have generous portion sizes when you order things by the half pound. The chicken was dry and the ribs were even drier. The sauce was ok, but i didn't like that I NEEDED the sauce to enjoy the food. They were out of Mac n cheese (which they told us after we had paid). The corn bread was stale and the pasta salad had a funny taste. We love Lucile's and prefer the other new place in town belles BBQ. This place is meh at best.",

The service was friendly and the food was one of the best barbecue in town. We even met the owner who cleared off our table for us. Nice friendly man.Glad we live close and we for sure will be visiting quite often. Best of luck in your new adventure of being a down home barbecue eating place.  Cheryl and Rick",

    "text": "As a competition smoker I know what Texas BBQ should taste like..this wasn't it.   The food was edible but not authentic as they claim.    Upon entering, one orders at the beginning of the line - the problem is that the menu sign is placed high on the wall, in the middle of the wall. It's difficult to see it and if there's more than a couple of people in front of you, you can't see it at all.  It makes ordering longer than it should.     The service staff working the line seem to be confused as what to do next.  They are loud, yelling back and forth to one another. It's unprofessional to say the least.  It's basically a cluster of confusion behind the counter.    By the time we sat down to eat, the food that meant to be hot was cold. The bread was dried out as if it had been sitting out. The brisket was dry and tough.  The pulled pork was cold and lacked smoke.  The potato salad had absolutely no taste other than salt.   We were there at 5pm on a Sat - they were out of chicken.  The busiest dining out night of the week and they are out of anything is really not a good idea.    Of all the issues we encountered, we could have overlooked, however, the owner roams the dining area asking if everything is good.  Any criticism is met with defensive comments, and a claim that they have only been open 'a couple of weeks'.   A couple of minutes, days, weeks, or months, really doesn't matter when you are charging higher than average prices for food and service is sub par.... you're either open for business or not and to serve a fair product for a fair price.  We didn't find that here - we had the feeling from the owner that it was favor that he opened a BBQ for public dining..he's full of himself.   Even in the reviews here - the owner responds with nasty defensive comments to the customer complaints.   Complaints and comments are meant to be used to improve your establishment, not to run customers to the nearest other restaurant.     There won't be a return visit to this place - I'll take my hard earned money and spend it on quality food, professional behavior and an owner that is thankful for our business.   Food is just part of the equation when eating out.",

We had chicken, ribs, pulled pork, brisket and tri-tip, none of the meat was flavored and the killer was the BBQ sauce didn't have any taste. We also tried the Cole slaw, BBQ Beans, potato salad and Mac&Cheese, all also lacked flavor. We really did have high hopes for this place after a customer leaving while we were arriving went out of his way to tell us how good it was.  The service was also a little clustered and it took awhile to get our food.",

The ribs were tender and fell right off of the bone, the tri-tip was smokey with the right amount of fattiness and my favorite part was actually the jalapeno cheese sausage. The Mac and cheese was average but the creamed corn was outstanding. I wish I would have tried the baked beans, they looked really good. The decor was awesome. From the picnic tables with rolls of paper towels, to the food served on parchment paper with sliced bread and the beer on tap. If they would have had some kind of cream pie or key lime for dessert it would have completed the experience. I will be back!",

Which would be ok if the food was suitable for human consumption! The Ribs had no sauce at all. The ribs were so tuff I loosened my teeth trying to eat them! You could tell they just threw a naked bone on a high fire and see how fast they could burn it done. The corn muffins advertised as corn bread smelled horrible made me want to vomit the smell coming out of that bag. Yes I said bag they threw them into a plain brown paper bag. Didn't matter I wasn't eating them it was horrible smelling! The fries were soggy and under cooked; just a pile of mush! The pecan pie was in a apple pie crust and was not good at all! I feel totally ripped off! These reviews on here have too be the owners of the restaurant no way someone could be happy with this place! Someone needs to explain to this horrible restaurant. Corn bread is suppose to be savory served with butter. BBQ ribs are suppose to be fall off the bone served in or with BBQ sauce! French fries are suppose to stand up not requiring a spoon to eat! Pecan pie is suppose to be sweet and served in a brown pecan crust! Save your money and run away from this restaurant!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Our family has gone several times since it's opened and love the concept and it's closeness to the home. The owner is very friendly and welcomes feedback.  I think they have some kinks to work out and definitely have a few consistence issues. Pulled pork and ribs are the best. The chicken is also great. The turkey had good flavor but was dry. Their brisket is good, but once we ordered it and it was underdone and rubbery.  The next time we went in it was great. The last time we ordered it it was 2 pieces of too thickly cut brisket and it was tough to eat because it was chewy and fatty.  Another issue is quantity- couple times we've gone and had plenty of meat and sides were filling and other times we felt a little shorted on the meat.  The last tidbit is dessert- boy one day we went in and had an amazing peach cobbler. The next time it was a dried up mess.  The sides we love the most are the beans, and Mac and cheese. Fries are fresh cut and cooked, not my favorite texture and the potato salad was a little dry for me. Overall, we're glad to have a great bbq place in our backyard. It's a nice place to go get a quick dinner, and it's definitely one our new favorite spots",

    "text": "First time last night. It was busy. You can tell the staff was not used to big crowds. They have been only open for a month, so that should get better over time. The bio online says \"meat served with generous portions of bread\" no one ordering around me had any bread on their tray. I think the meat on top a piece of bread would look more appealing then just dumping meat on a paper lined tray. The menu said baked potato as a side, but we were told they aren't serving them anymore and they'll be taken off the menu ( why not mark it off the menu instead of explaining that every time someone asks). The meats we ordered (brisket, pulled pork, and chicken) were delicious. We only had Mac and cheese and fries, so I do not know about the other sides. They were decent portions and also good. I liked how they had a regular bbq sauce and also a spicy mustard base one! The soda machine was out of all diet drinks. Maybe someone should have told the owner who was walking around talking to the guests. He didn't come by mine or I would have told him. I'd go back again and try some different meats and sides. Maybe they'll be a little more organized.",

They were able to turn what could have been a disappointing situation into a great one! I called in my order the other night and when I went in to pick it up, they were out of one of the sides I had ordered. I was fortunate enough to have the owner, Brian, walk in right around that time. He heard that they had run out of the side I had ordered for all 3 sandwiches and he apologized and offered to give me 2 other sides instead. I was pleasantly surprised when he came out with 2 containers of the additional sides AND he had also made the missing side (Mac N Cheese) FRESH for me! That is the kind of ownership pride and customer service that should be the norm, but is rare to find these days. My boyfriend was astonished when I brought out all of the food. Not only do they have amazing BBQ (the meat is crazy tender), but they also have an awesome owner. Thank you for giving us a BBQ place that we can rely on! We appreciate it! :)",

Typically beef ribs are big and meaty. These ribs came out over-cooked and very small. They were mostly bone and had very little meat. For $17 I was surprised there were only 4 small bones. The Mac and cheese was flavorless and the creamed corn tasted like it came right out of a Del Monte can. My wife's salad consisted( $8.99) literally of a mound of lettuce with two small containers of ranch dressing. The food was served directly on plastic cafeteria trays with plastic silverware. There were no plates on the tray and combined with the plastic silverware it made it difficult to cut the ribs without the tray sliding around. I am all for new restaurants in our area and understand a place being new, but in this case the most important part, the food, made a very poor first impression.",

I have not run across other place that can smoke meat as well. However, their sides are slightly below average. Going even further, what is really holding them back are all the small things. You can get a sandwich from them with awesome meat, but served on an un-toasted bun that looks like it came from Wal-mart. At least toast the bun! Also, some of their sauces like ranch, are not made fresh and have the distinctive taste of coming from a bottle, like a cheap plastic Kraft bottle. I don't think they are even getting it wholesale. Also, every time I go there the prices continue to increase, and its not always represented on the menu. The whole place reeks of poor management and execution. It is a real shame because their meats are so good, but I think they need to start having more consistent pricing, and either make their buns and sauces themselves, or at least buy it wholesale.",

    "text": "We are residents of Henderson and just finished our first (of many to come) dining experience at Big B's.  In a few words, it's fantastically delicious.  In addition, the owner Brian, who we met and is very cordial, does the cooking of his own recipes.  Brian is also a \"big\" guy so it's pretty easy to see where the name Big B's comes from.  Everyone was super friendly and the food was outstanding.  Be aware Brian has some wonderful recipes and his preparation is different than anything we had ever experienced.  I say that because my wife ordered the baby-backs and when they came they appeared to be dry and overcooked.  Don't be fooled---they're fabulous when you bite into them.  I had the Tri tip----also tender and loaded with flavor.  I shared one half piece of Tri with my wife but ate two of her ribs.  She said that wasn't fair so we ordered a take out order just to pacify her.  We'll be going back many many times. We've tried some of the other so called BBQ places in town over the years, but thank God Brian located in Henderson.  Knowing now how tasty everything is I would drive as far as it took just to eat there (maybe not Texas).  If you try this place pretty sure you will love it like we did.  p.s.  It's larger than it looks and can easily accommodate large party's.",

    "text": "I have tried this place on three occasions and well it's not the best but deciding between a three and a four star it's definitely closer to four  The first time I went I had a three meat plate tritip brisket and pulled pork for 15.99 for three meets and 2 sides it's a decent value  Brisket was very good nice smoke ring with the tritip it had decent flavor but it didn't pop maybe it's because I'm from California and I've had Santa Maria style tri-tip most of my life I'm more used to a dry rub crust on the outside of my tritip, this was more juicy. The pulled pork didn't wow me it was decent but my my least favorite. I got the creamed corn and mac & cheese, mac & cheese was good I have had better and the creamed corn was kind of a thick consistency and very sweet, interesting pudding like texture.  The next time  I decided to go with a sandwich and not knowing how much meat we going to six-inch sub, I got a foot-long my only complaint was the up charge of three dollars for brisket or tritip wound up making it a $17 sandwich almost with tax. I actually turned it into two meals and it was good portion and this time the tritip was better than the first time. I would say you're better off getting a plate vs a sandwich at those prices unless you want to pulled pork or a hotlink sandwich  The most recent trip decided to try the same three meets again they kept on improving so that's why this is 4 stars, I got the bakedd beans and the cream corn again, The beans had a good flavor to them on the creamed corn that a completely different texture and consistency and was better and not as sweet  The owners and staff are nice, the space is nice and lots of open areas with TVs  While there are better barbecue places in town and traveling cross-country I've had better barbecue, for place that's a half a mile away from my office I'm sure I'll be going a few times a month, I like it more than the new Bell's BBQ (which wasn't horrible), this is just a better option",

    "text": "By far the worst barbecue I've ever had! Dickeys has them beat by far--as does Lucilles and I don't even like Lucilles. I had high hopes for the place as all the local food bloggers had posted great pictures of the food. The woman helping us order answered all our questions well and was very nice and courteous. Everything from there was a steep downhill ride. After we had paid and sat down, we waited a great deal of time for food that was already prepared. The woman bringing the food out warned us not to eat the chicken skin as it would not be good?? I've NEVER had barbecue chicken where the skin is inedible--nor have I had a server tell me it was going to be! In disbelief, I tried it anyway and was shocked that she was right. It was tough like leather. It was no joke, the chicken was actually inedible which was a shame as half of the flavor in bbq chicken is the skin! Actually, that's probably a misstatement as 100% of the flavor was probably in the skin in this case as the chicken WAS NOT SALTED AT ALL. Shocked I dug into my baby back ribs--by far my favorite bbq meat. It wasn't salted either! Nor was it seasoned or spiced at all! The only flavor was a bit of underwhelming smokiness. It was tender, but dry but not quite fall off the bone. The only saving grace was the creamed corn, and that was more like cream of corn soup! The potato salad, like the rest of the soup was not seasoned aside from a dash of pepper. Again, no salt. The macaroni and cheese was mush--and surprise surprise, also had no salt aside from whatever cheese they had put into it. Extremely hopeful that the sauce would add some kind of redeeming quality to the meat I found it was watery and just as bland as everything else that had come out. The highlight of the meal was unfortunately the sliced bread and even that was dry.",

When we walked in, we were offered a sample of the brisket while waiting in line and it pretty much melted in my mouth! My husband and I ordered the 3 meat plate with tri-tip, brisket, and pulled pork with baked beans and fries as our sides. Our friend got the ribs and tri-tip with cream corn and beans. All were so yummy! The meats were very tender and flavorful without the need for any BBQ sauce (although the 2 BBQ sauces they had were very tasty). I didn't have the bread but the boys didn't complain about it being stale. Big B came to our table while we were eating to check in on us and introduce himself. He is such a sweet man and we are proud of his accomplishment! We all washed our meals down with some delicious sweet tea and called it a night. We definitely will be back for more the next time we are in town!",

The Ultimate BBQ Sandwich was, as usual, juicy, tender, flavorful and delicious. There has to be at least one pound of yummy meat on this sandwich. The sides are the best. Cheesiest mac and cheese ever. Cole slaw....great. Fries....hot and delicious. Service was absolutely great. The staff was on point, as usual. Always helpful.

We wanted to try the different meat specials and the way it was explained was that you could order it and get a few bones for $5 extra. Cool! But no, it was if you want ribs, as a part of the platter, you would have to pay $5 for a few bones. Well, that was not looking promising.  When the order came...WHOA!!!! Not a few bones. It was like half a dozen. The plates were incredible. We could not even eat all the food. We had the baby back, the chicken, smoked turkey and hot links. All incredible. The corn bread were like muffins and had the slightest hint of cinnamon. CINNAMON! Brilliant. The slaw wonderful. The corn on the cob was a bit mushy, but it was close to closing, so I'm sure if we had gone earlier, it would have been fine. The picnic table idea is cute, but I found chunks of food between the slats. Not a huge thing, but kinda gives me the creeps. The lighting is low, so it is hard to see if it is night. Again, not a huge thing, just...eww.  I can guarantee that we will be back. The food was very reasonable considering the quantity.",

Real Texas BBQ is love, it's passion for flavor...it's the development of complex flavors and down home comfort by using great cuts of meat, fresh spices, talent, and love of what you do.  Brian and his team at Big B's are at the top of their game. We had brisket, tri-tip, turkey, and a hot link.  The flavor was out of control. The smoke ring was perfect!

I was craving bbq chicken and was delighted with the delicate texture of it. You won't need a knife! It falls off the bone. My husband had the smoked turkey sandwich. It was so good! The sides are bigger than expected. Texas sized?  You won't be disappointed. Go! Get it to-go, whatever, just go!",

    "text": "It's summer, and that means enjoying good BBQ and ice cold beer in the 110F oven.  Oh yeah.   Note:  There is a wonderfully aromatic indoor dining room filled with communal picnic benches and rolls of paper towels (cool) but BBQ somehow taste better in the great outdoors.   Big B's fits the bill in Vegas if you've got a hankering for some low and slow flavors of Texas but let's just say, this ain't Lockhart or Austin.  I'm not gonna criticize a pitmaster's passionate art so let's just say, my personal preferences don't line up but hey, food here is solid.   Note:  All meats sold by the pound,  1/2 or full rack or as part of a plate.    Brisket (fat end) - Good smoke ring, decent bark with a simple rub, clean smoke flavor with no acrid finish.  I prefer brisket to quiver as it's being sliced, juicier, where pieces are just barely able to support their own weight when held between your fingers.  Beef ribs - Clean smoky flavor, tender, and satisfying.  I do prefer three inches of juicy, quivering meat on my bones (See Blacks BBQ in Lockart) but this is A-OK.  Pork ribs - Clean smoke flavor, nice rub that definitely brings out the flavor of the pork.  Well trimmed with membrane removed prior to the rub being applied.  Tender and relatively moist.  No complaints.  Beef sausage - it is.  Not memorable but no complaints.  Sides - None sampled.  Can't afford to waste stomach space when chowing down on good BBQ cow and pig.    Sauces - None sampled.  Who the heck uses sauce on BBQ from Texas anyway.  Very friendly, no nonsense service.  Prices in line.  All told, very satisfying belly busting grub.",

    "text": "I love the pulled pork.   Big B's is a huge space with lots of parking. You could have a party where everyone drives separately and there would still be room to park and eat. Picnic tables aplenty, you can bring the whole family and then some. Like I said, huge!!!  I ordered the single meat plate. Pulled pork is life and that's all I needed. Plus, it comes with two sides!!! Like Thanksgiving, to me, BBQ is all about the sides. I opted for the coleslaw this time and the beans. You guys, their beans are the magical fruit! So much flavor.   My friend got the two meat plate with chicken and brisket. He elected Mac and cheese and fried okra for sides. I totally stole massive amounts of the Mac and cheese to mix with my beans and was surprised by the fried okra. Didn't think that it was my jam from pervious experiences at other joints, but these were crispy little nuggets of flavor! The crunch was perfect.   The portions here are generous, staff is super passionate, and there is plenty of room for all of Vegas to grab a seat and eat.   Ask for a side of Yelp Sauce. It's spicy AF and a great addition to their BBQ sauce served on the tables. Yum yum yum.",

There was only one couple in line when we went in so there was no wait, looked at the menu and decided to try the two meat combo with tri tip and jalapeno cheddar sausage along with mac and cheese and the fries.   The sausage was very dry and chewy and I couldn't finish it, the tri tip was lackluster in flavor and had to add sauce to eat. The mac and cheese was good and had good flavor, the fries on the hand where not great and also had a few of them and decided not to eat them.   Overall I might consider this place again, but not anytime soon",

Once we told her it was our first time there, she immediately brought us some samples of a couple of their meats to try before we ordered - smoked turkey, brisket and tri-tip!!! The thoughtfulness behind that one moment made us big fans from the start!! The food was delicious! I ordered a half pound of brisket and a half pound of pulled pork with a side salad and ranch. The brisket was my absolute favorite!!! I can't wait to go back to Big B's, the place itself was clean and welcoming on top of the staff that greeted us when we walked in! We will be repeat customers for sure!!",

As soon as you walk in, you smell barbeque and I was hungry! There is a Texas theme with country music playing in the background. It is like a fast-food barbeque without the fast food price. I ordered baby back ribs. They peeled right off the bones and were delicious. The platter was offered with two sides. I ordered the salad which was a good size but they forgot to put the dressing on it. So I compromised and used the vinegar on the table instead. The platter also included bread. They give you two slices of white sandwich bread. I think they could have done something better than that. At least perhaps some fresh baked dinner rolls or sourdough bread. My husband ordered the barbecue Turkey. It wasn't enough for him. He left the place hungry. I really don't think we will be returning....",

I happened to be on this side of town with T to do his cake tasting at Freed's. We decided to stop in for lunch since we were on that side of the valley for once. I'd been really looking forward to giving this place a shot after seeing a few of my IG Foodie friends post some delicious looking BBQ.   We ordered the 3 meat combo and got the tri tip, brisket (both lean and regular) and paid the $5 up charge for a half rack of pork ribs. Our sides were Mac and cheese and fries.  Everything had the day old leftover taste and appearance. The Mac and cheese was dry. I understand it's more of the home style Mac and cheese, but it wasn't very cheese-y. A majority of the fries were soggy, I'd say about 90% of them and were obviously not fresh and ruled inedible by the fry king. The thing he hates most is soggy fries. He (we) barely touched them or the Mac and cheese.   The meat, all of the cuts except for the regular brisket (which was on the mushy side) were dry. The lean brisket was real decent. The tri tip? Dry. You can see the dry spots in my attached photo. Ribs? Also dry. I wasn't surprised because of the super thick bark on it. They also weren't as meaty as other local BBQ spots I've tried Collectively, there was the telltale bitter, over-smoked taste that lingered.. Sad face.   The customer service was real great for us personally and the establishment is super clean with lots of TV's.",

Creamed corn was addicting. Corn bread had a touch of a cinnamony taste--but was delicious. Mac&cheese was a little dry but that didn't stop me from finishing it...so...take that as you will.   My only reason for dropping a star is the fact that all of the photos I had seen showed the plates coming with pickles and onions, etc. All of the fixins that you're used to getting at a BBQ joint, and we got none of that. Which was a little disappointing. If you're supposed to ask for that, I didn't realize and I'll take that as a \"my bad\" but I didn't know that was a thing. Maybe next time I'll ask.  Mustard BBQ sauce was delicious, though I didn't use much of it, and the regular BBQ sauce was vinegar-y and tasty.   Prices were definitely well worth the BBQ craving that curbed by this meal.  We'll definitely be back the next time the BBQ craving hits...but it probably won't be very soon, because if I turn this into a habit...I'll weigh 900 pounds.

They by far are my favorite baked beans ever. Macaroni and cheese was excellent as was the potato salad. I don't just eat anyone's potato salad either!

    "text": "Overall: I won't claim to be a BBQ aficionado but this is hands down the best BBQ that I've had. Plus, the service is awesome!  Food: 4.5  2 Meat Plate ($15): This is definitely enough for two people as long as you aren't strong eaters. We got the trip tip and ribs (extra $5) with coleslaw, french fries, and mac & cheese.  Tri Tip: I'm amazed by how lean yet tender this was. It is on the drier side because it's a lean piece of meat, but this a good choice if you want to avoid super fatty meats. If you want something juicier, I'd definitely get the brisket!  Baby Back Ribs: Don't expect thick globs of sauce slathered on. These were dry but well seasoned. The ribs had nice crisp outer pieces with meat tender enough to pull with a fork.  Coleslaw: Balance was perfect. I appreciate that this wasn't too heavy because there was a touch of acidity in the dressing.  French Fries: They use fresh cut potatoes, so they don't get extra crispy. But they have great seasoning, and you'll like them if you don't mind a fry with a soft crispy outside and fluffy inside.  Mac & Cheese: Unfortunately, this was just slightly better than KFC. It was a tad too dry, and it lacked the cheesy, flavorful punch of really good mac & cheese.  Service: 5  This is kind of like a quick service restaurant where you order and pay at the counter and then someone brings out your food to your table.  The entire staff was pretty nice. When they found out that it was our first time, they explained the entire menu, and they even offered samples for us! They were super generous with their samples, and they gave thick slices of brisket to each person in our party when asked.  Ambiance: 5  The moment you walk in you smell the BBQ. It's a super cute restaurant that totally embraces its Texas BBQ theme. The dining area is designed like an outdoor picnic area with long wooden benches and tables with umbrellas. I also love that you have a view of the kitchen!",

    "text": "Got a little bit Texas reckless with the homie at Big B's.   Confession: I don't love Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese has disappointed me time and time again, and I've disgraced my loved ones and lost friends over my lack of love of Mac and cheese. However, I *love* their #macandcheese literally the best I've ever had.   But you're not reading this for my Mac and cheese review. #bbq is great. Juicy, tender. Everything a #meat eater could want. I recommend the #babybackribs #pulledpork and #hotlinks and #chicken in particular. No shade to the other meats. I haven't left any other bbq place craving #brisket or #turkey  Back to the sides the #fries are UH-MAZING. While I'm eating them I'm literally thinking, \"Mom would love these fries.\" (editor's note: mom can be picky when it comes to fry praise) fries are a must. And the #coleslaw is a standout. Creamy without being super mayo-y. Last standout, the #cornbread is basically dessert. It's got cinnamon or brown sugar or something that kicks it up a notch. Makes it stand out amongst other cornbreads. Potato salad was good. And Baked beans were much too sweet for me (and that's me saying that).",

I was skeptical of the cheese/jalapeno hot links my BF wanted but that was my all time favorite.  We also got the brisket, ribs and pulled pork.  All were good but the cheese/jalapeno hot links beat them all.    They have two sauces on the table. One was a regular bbq sauce the second one was very vinagery which wasn't bad but it was different. Interesting tasting. Not my favorite.  They also have a spicy sauce you have to ask for and that was actually very good.  Their sides were just ok. Not great and even though I heard good things about their BBQ Beans, it was watery and more like chili to me than BBQ beans.  Overall, we'll be back again.  We even had leftovers for lunch the next day.  Highly recommended.",

I also got the fried okra, cream corn and French fries, which were all great.  The menu is huge and when I went in, it was still early before dinner, around 4pm.  The service I received was very friendly and helpful since it was my first time there.  They have picnic tables and the usual paper towels on each table bc its after all, bbq!

    "text": "I was in town with my family and my mom originally wanted a seafood buffet. After searching for one that was fairly cheap as well as good, I found out that the cheapest and best Sunday seafood buffet was at M Resort, but to my mom's dismay, it was $39.99 per person. So she said forget it and wanted BBQ instead. As my husband was driving to the nearest gas station (which by the way I was also looking up gas prices on Gas Buddy), I was frantically searching for a BBQ place close by. Now I'm pretty particular about my BBQ. So when I saw this place on Yelp, which has 4 stars at almost 400 reviews, I was hoping the Yelpers won't lead me astray on this one.   My fellow Yelpers did not! Mind you, my parents are old and they can't hear well and it takes a while for them to figure out what they want to eat, especially my dad. He always asks \"what's good Gracie?\" I always tell him, \"anything you order, dad\". So when we entered the restaurant and was greeted by the nice man placing our order, the man was very patient and kind with my parents. So kudos to that guy.   We all ordered plates -- 1 to 3 bbq items and 2 sides. BONUS: we got an extra side for checking in on Yelp. So don't forget to check in! We ordered beef ribs, pork ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, fried okra, potato salad, coleslaw, cornbread, and corn.   Mom paid for us at the counter after we were done ordering. We went to the Coke machine, which is one of those really cool ones with like 100 flavors and grabbed a seat at one of the larger picnic tables. Not more than 10 minutes later, we received our food. Everything smelled smoky and looked so juicy. Those smoke rings though... the cornbread... meh, but everything else was superb!  Definitely try this place out if you're looking for good bbq in the South LV area.",

Also, it may be a Texas thing to not have plates, but I learned I really enjoy when my food comes on a plate.   $30 for two (without alcohol) was too spendy for our experience.",

The place is huge, kind of country dive cool. Country music blaring...I would have preferred old school R&B or funk, but they were going for a redneck vibe.  As I walked in, everyone turns and greeted me...nice. I ordered a 3-item plate, chicken, brisket and links with Mac and Cheese and Cole Slaw...plus an ice cold beer.  Food came fast, couple people walked over to check on me throughout the meal to make sure all was good. It was great. Brisket was so tender that it could be cut with a fork, Chicken and Links were spot on. Mac and Cheese was ordinary and Cole Slaw was exceptional.  Great job folks! I'll be back.  (...and the wife is fine.)",

I had a coupon from a zip code magazine, good for a free pulled pork sandwich w/one side upon spending $10.  We ordered 2 pulled pork sandwiches which included a total of 3 sides plus a soda.  The soda machine was being temperamental so we started off with a 1/2 glass of sweet tea which way to sweet for our tastes.  In the meantime, our pulled pork sandwiches served on a large roll arrived. The portion size of pulled pork was very generous, and the meat proved to be both tender and delicious. My wife enjoyed the mac and cheese side and devoured the baked bean with the 3rd side, coleslaw, largely ignored.",

I'm a big fan of their pulled pork because it's so flavorful and not dried out at all. I usually go for the sliders and mac and cheese and spicy baked beans for my side. If you want a bigger meal, go for the plates. They also have desserts, never tried because I'm always stuffed after my meal here but they always look tasty. Another plus is that they have wine and beer, good selection too!   Inside is decorated well with lots of picnic tables and string lights. Definitely gives you that country BBQ feel. They have tvs and if I'm not mistaken, they regularly show the games. Great place for any size party. I will definitely be back again and again!",

I would probably say the brisket was my favorite! It was lean and moist with just the right amount of smoke flavor! The Cole slaw was delicious with great tang and crunch! The Mac and cheese was also delightful! The staff are pleasant and the owners are so grateful as if you're friends and always welcome to come back!

    "text": "Barbecue joints are getting to be a dime a dozen. It's getting to where you can't turn a corner without seeing a barbecue place. There are some that stand out. Big B's Barbecue is one of those stand out places in my opinion.  My wife and I each had a 3 meat plate with two sides. Each plate could definitely feed two people. We ended up taking home the leftovers. It seems pricy at $17.99 each but they're pretty big portions.  We each had the hot link, very generous portions of brisket and pulled pork all very tender and moist. We each had the Mac and cheese, but I had potato salad while she had the baked beans. I don't know what's in the baked beans but I almost snatched the cup from my wife. At first I was disappointed to see picnic tables. I have a big gut making it difficult to sit at picnic tables. These have high table tops making it easy for someone like me to sit in them. They also have wooden chairs and tables made from cable spools.  We've been to Dick's on Las Vegas Blvd, Famous Dave's, Lucille's and Memphis BBQ on Warm Springs. My wife and I both agreed this is our favorite.  We met the owner himself and the staff was super nice and friendly. I highly recommend trying this place if you love barbecue. If you eat too much it's conveniently near to Saint Rose Hospital.",

We were told to share a 3 meat plate that came with 2 sides (and an extra if you check in on yelp) and bread.  Ordered: Pulled Pork, Tri-tip brisket and baby back ribs ($5 extra due to half slab). On the side we chose Mac n cheese, beans and fries.   The sauce made the meal, and pretty much stole the show for me. The meat wasn't the tastiest as far as bbq joints went and I regret buying such large portions. I know they dry rub their meat, but it comes off too dry and I have to dump sauce to flavor it.   Tables are picnic tables and napkins are paper towels located at each table, along with their sauces. If you want some heat, you can ask for some of their hot sauce.   Service was the one great thing. Natalia knew her meats and was incredibly accommodating and patient while we chose what to order. Everyone else from the cashier to what I believe to be a manager, was kind and welcoming.   I'll try again next time and see if it changes any.",

The food-  I'm not a big fan of mesquite and it was just ok in my book. I really prefer hickory or pecan. My pulled pork was tender and flavorful though. Not the best I've ever had, but good.   They have one main bbq sauce and a hotter mustard type sauce.  Wish they had more sauces.   The sides, I did not care for the baked beans. The Mac and cheese was good , I'll definitely try again.   All in all, a good and promising experience. I look forward to going back.",

They are consistently very good with the bbq beans being some of the best I have had.   The meats have a wonderful smoke flavor and you can taste the love. I usually get either brisket or tri tip but last night I tried the ribs for the first time and they were outstanding. Prepared exactly how I like ribs, no sauce but tender, moist and fall of the bone. Like the other meats they had a great smoky flavor. A little pricey at $15 for a half rack but well worth it.   Big B's is a great choice for BBQ when in the area. They have a large beer and wine selection and plenty of picnic bench seating. They will continue to be my go-to for BBQ!",

    "text": "I have to say that BBQ is such temperamental food. It has to be cooked and stored and served all within a time frame where all that hard work is actually noticeable and enjoyable.   I've experienced first hand getting microwaved items from a local establishment and was skeptical to eat here when I saw how empty it was during an early lunch. I did end up being served one of the best bbq meals I've ever had in my life. I have to say that's not saying much since I've only had bbq in Vegas.  My favorite item here is the turkey oddly enough. The brisket was also equally drool worthy. I also love all of their sides. The macaroni and cheese is amazing too. I like how this is just traditional bbq with no fancy or extra this or that. It's just solid food that's very satisfying.  My favorite thing about bbq is that the reason it tastes good is the technique that's used. It's just naturally good on its own aka I don't like sauce.  Everything is always super moist and fresh. They also have beer to enjoy with your meal. The space itself is very very big with picnic style benches. I'm totally into it.  I can't say anything about service because you don't really deal with the employees after your food is dropped off. They are always pleasant up front though.  I recommend getting a plate with a couple of sides and some slices of white bread. I honestly think the servings are enough to share and a good way to sample their meats.",

It's amazing how much you get your money's worth there. My family of 3 could have split one \"small\" meal. The meats were good. The food was overall descent.

I don't eat them often, but when I do, I want a place I can rely on. Big Bs has fit the bill. You know the food is truly smoked the moment you set near the front door on the outside. And it's dry rubbed, so you can taste the True flavor without it being lathered in sauce to hide it. Mine were perfect. I ordered a two meat plate with tri tip and double bbq beans. Wow, you know those beans have been slow cooked because the meat has melted down into the sauce. Incredible. The tri tip is delicious as well. Since it was a lot of food for me, I am going to make a pot of chili and add the left over tri tip. I wish I had a dog to give the near empty bones to, they were Devine. I will be back to try other things, and of course, my beef ribs.",

They gave us a mountain of pulled pork...plenty for 2 to share. The BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy and complimented the meat well. The staff was very thoughtful and kept checking in on us.

I had the baby back ribs - they tasted old, gamy, and had thar nasty old pork taste and lacked any flavor whatsoever. When pork is fresh and cooked right, it should taste moist, buttery, and just taste delicious. This was not the case. I ate one rib and it was one rib too much.   My other half had the brisket - it was tough, Chewy, dry and had ZERO flavor.   The Mac and cheese tasted like nothing other than extreme smoke. Tasted burned and flavorless. Tasted nothing but smoke.   The baked beans were overly sweet and had a strong pungent flavor of a concoction I had never tasted before. Canned baked beans were better than this.   The owner or manager circled the floor as I stated to my other half, \"I have never had ribs this bad before.\" I know he heard me because He stated, \"if there's something you don't like, I will be happy to bring you something else.   I felt so bad and was far too embarrassed to be a jerk and confront him when clearly he felt so proud of their new business. I nodded and he continued on to the next table.   The atmosphere was far too quiet, the tables were far too big and spread apart. There was no energy. It was dark and lacked that upbeat atmosphere you expect from a BBQ restaurant.   When we first arrived, people would come in and see the food and would walk right out. 7 peolple ahead of us left shortly after we arrived. That should've been our cue to take our leave as well. The food was placed in an assembly line - cafeteria style. You could tell that the food had been sitting there a while on the food warmers. But still, I wanted to give it a chance despite my other half wanting us to leave.   We had a few bites of each of our plates and decided to get a to go box to take to feed a homeless person who was in dire need of food. I felt horrible throwing food away, do I didn't.   The only thing that was good was my blue moon I had before we ran out of the place.   I love BBQ especially with my spouse being from Texas. I wish I had a raving review but for the first time, I have to give the lowest review possible.  If you are a BBQ enthusiast, please beware before wasting your money. This place isn't that cheap and the food was an utter disappointment. :-(  The staff was friendly, but that was the extent to the good about this place.   We settled for raising canes in the same parking lot after wasting a Friday evening out on a horrible experience.  I really do hope they remedy this quickly because it does look like they did put a lot of into it.",

    "text": "BBQ and sides are very hard to rate due to everyone's personal preference and taste. We can all discuss KC, Memphis, St. Louis, Texas, etc... and have a different opinion. This place is nothing special, but it is good. It has good portions; the ribs and pulled pork are great. I do like the bbq sauce as my personal taste. The sides are decent, coleslaw, okra, potato salad. I do like the country bbq atmosphere with good country music playing.   However, they do need to work on their operational management, such as taking the order without the customer being able to look at the sides, the menu is too far away, food items coming to your table at different times (it is laid out very awkward).   If the owner is reading this, he needs to work on his pricing or he will be out of business soon. This is simple-easy-math. I can order the baby back ribs 1/2 slab for $14 or I can order the #1 meat plate with two sides for $9.99 (1/2 slab). I don't want to go into detail on the managerial accounting aspect, unless of course, you want to hire me.",

    "text": "Anyone familiar to the Vegas/Henderson area knows we have been lacking good BBQ. I'd like to thank Brian (owner) for choosing the location. I know the cost of having a business in Vegas/Henderson is more expensive to maintain than the country convenience down south specifically in Texas and Louisiana where sometimes ownership of business and land has been handed down for generations. In Nevada the cost of wood and general lack of authentic ingredients is also an obstacle and understandably the price is factored into the menu.  I'm originally from Texas and my family knows about Kreuz Market in Lockhart (TX), Meyer's Elgin Smokehouse in Elgin (TX), and Zimmerhanzel's Bar-B-Que in Smithville (TX) which was just sold after 36 years of business, but reopening soon if anyone is traveling down to that neck of the woods.  My recommendation is for everyone to support Big B's BBQ. It is a new establishment and it will take some time for such things, i.e. tweaking the menu for the likes of locals. I think menu prices will stabilized when the best economic suppliers are found. The staff is super kind and the place is really clean. So instead of losing another twenty bucks in a slot machine, take a break and treat yourself to something more worthwhile. It's good eats for the whole family.  Now about the BBQ! My wife had the pork ribs plate and it was excellent.The ribs might be my favorite on the menu as well. I had a po'boy with the brisket upgrade. What would a southern style BBQ place be without good brisket?! Well the brisket did not disappoint...it is good! I'd prefer a baguette for the po'boy but the soft dough bread used was still good. I have not tried the sausage yet, but will when I get the opportunity. Down south, the sausage is eaten separately on a plate or in what we call wraps or a wrap around, which is found on many BBQ joint menus  (basically bread wrapped around sausage with BBQ sauce). Btw the BBQ sauce used at Big B's BBQ is really good. I'd like to see a hot BBQ sauce added to the selection.   Next about the sides! Now this is where personal taste comes into play and I know depending on the region of the U.S. a person is originally from that tastes do vary. Personally I tend to like food more spicy. My favorite side is the beans. My wife liked the corn on the cob. I thought the coleslaw could of used a more tangy component and be slightly sweeter as well. I think the mac & cheese was good but needed a smokier taste, perhaps some bacon added. The mac and cheese will be a hit with the kids. My grandma used to fry okra, green tomatoes, and squash. I'll have to give the fried okra a try next visit to see if it matches up.  Condiments. Well here is where a few inexpensive additions would be greatly appreciated. Please consider replacing the hot sauce brand you currently use with Tabasco, Crystals, Louisiana Hot Sauce, or Trappey's brand. These are the more authentic popular table and BBQ joint brands used in Texas and Louisiana.   Desserts? I have a few suggestions. I think peach cobbler, pecan pie, banana pudding, creme brule'e, leche flan, and/or cheesecake would all be tasty treats. Maybe even a soft serve ice cream machine in the future for the kids.  Overall this a really good place to enjoy BBQ. Serving portions are adequate. I've met Brian (the owner) and I can tell you that he works hard to bring satisfaction to the public.",

    "text": "I had some high hopes after reading the reviews for the restaurant. As an overall view, it came out a little lacking. Perhaps I encountered an off night.      I always like to give as much a try as possible, so I went with the 3 meat platter. My choices were brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs, with sides of fried okra and Mac-and-cheese. My friend went with a brisket plate and some sides.      I thought my platter was a decent size, but I felt a little bad for my friend. The single serving of brisket plate (with sides) was only 3 slices of brisket, and fairly thin ones at that.      For the food, I did think the brisket was pretty good. A little on the drier side, but good texture and smoke flavor. The pulled pork was a little odd. I had some very long, stringy, and tough pieces. An ok smoke flavor, but otherwise the rest was fairly bland. The ribs were a decent size portion, but otherwise weren't very good. Part of the issue was they were taken out of a covered tray that was filled with liquid. So they were very damp/wet and kind of soggy. No crust or smoky flavor left in them. They fell apart, but not in a good way. It was as if they were overcooked and just became kind of mushy. The tomato based BBQ sauce was ok, extremely sweet, kind of fruity.      As for the sides, the fried okra was pretty good, maybe a bit overly salted and peppered. I needed plenty of water with them. Good texture and could have been perfect with a little less seasoning. The Mac-and-cheese was a definite miss. Extremely overcooked pasta and kind of a container of soft mush.      The location was cool and the staff was extremely friendly. It's a shame that I felt like while nothing was totally terrible, a lot of things just missed and the food was very \"eh\".  Edit: I'd like to say I super-appreciate the time that one of the owners took to contact me on my review. Extremely professional and polite. I'd like to make sure it's clear, a lot of this was based off of my own, personal preferences. It's hard to give reviews without the perceived without the less-than-positive parts possibly coming off overly harsh or critical. While my tastes are what they are, for those who would and do enjoy this restaurant on a different place from my own opinions, I do recommend it based off of their professionalism and say it's worth giving a try.",

    "text": "So me and my Dad decided to head over here despite being on the other side of town. It was a co-worker's recommendation and she said it was the best in town as far as word of mouth. I'm always up for barbecue and if its Texas style then I'm sold. One thing I know about bbq restaurants is that the good ones usually sell all their good cuts within the first hours of opening. So to be fair it was wrong on my part to go here when they're almost closing.   There were still plenty of people. One guy was probably too eager to get to his food because he ended up missing the chair he was sitting on and tumbled backwards. A scene straight out of a comedy film. Or a meme. Whichever suits your fancy. But anyways, the place is spacious. There are park style benches all over the dining area and some round tables with an umbrella on the middle. Gives it a park feel. You walk up to the counter and place your order like any other bbq joint. I guess the owner was still there because he greeted us. Either he owned the place or he's a manager. Either way he didn't need a megaphone if he was a cop in a hostage situation or a bank robbery. Nope, not with a voice as loud as his. Its not bad, he greeted us after all.   So Me and my Dad both got a two meat plate. I got a Beef Rib and Brisket, he got Hot Links and Tri Tip. I was excited. Because when I saw the picture of the Beef Rib when my coworker showed it to me it was massive. And all the meat and fat on it was just making me hungry. So the food got to us and sadly I was kind of disappointed. The Brisket was good. Very tender, falls apart just using your fork. But it tasted kinda bland. No smoky flavor. I ended up having to douse it with a lot of their barbecue sauce on the side. Usually I don't like putting sauce on barbecue because I appreciate the effort and love that goes into cooking these meats. The Beef Rib, disappointed me. I mean I said from the start it was our fault for coming in at a short notice. The stuff we ate was probably gonna end up in the trash after closing. But the Beef Rib I got didn't have any meat on it. It was 70% rib 10% cartilage 10% fat and 10% lean meat. I didn't really like gnawing on a piece of rib that had a chunk of the meat cut out from it but that's what it felt like. As if someone sliced the actual meat on the top of the rib and then flash fried and then served it to us. I was honestly expecting something a little bit more presentable. Even if I wasn't enjoying the ribs I had to finish it because I didn't wanna make the place look bad. When the servers came to ask us how we were doing I just politely said \"we're good\" because they had a long day. No point in complaining about something that was my fault to begin with. The brisket did keep me full at least. That and my dad kind of felt sorry for me so he gave me some of his tri tip and hot links.   In my opinion I need to give this place another go. Preferably right after opening. Because like I said in the beginning. The better cuts are sold within hours from opening. So yeah I might drop by again tomorrow or sometime next week to try the beef ribs again. I saw some really juicy ones in the photos section and I want to have those cuts. Not the pathetic cut I got. But other than that the other choice of meats weren't bad. They weren't mind blowing either. I suppose I have a different idea as to what good barbecue tastes like. Not that I have any other places to recommend but seeing really good ribs on TV and having tried other BBQ places here in town. I would say Big B's wasn't any different from them. But we'll see.",

    "text": "This place is INCREDIBLE! I take my barbeque VERY seriously. Having spent a significant chunk of my youth in Houston, TX and sampling BBQ from all across the state, pretty much all BBQ outings for me now start hopeful and end in crushing disappointment. This was different. The experience starts as soon as you walk in. The wafting aromas of rich smoke and meat are almost a meal all unto themselves. They take your order on a written ticket, with several options of meat to choose from. My wife and I each got 2-meat plates, which comes with 2 sides and 2 slices of bread for sammich making or for soppins. My wife got Pulled Pork and Tri Tip, Mac and Cheese and BBQ Beans. I got Pulled Pork and Brisket, Fried Okra and Potato Salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. Highlights were definitely the Pulled Pork, the BBQ Beans (best I've EVER had), the Potato Salad, and the Mac. Their Sweet Tea is the perfect accompaniment. It's fresh brewed, Texas-sweet, and 100% quenching. Also, the Sauce... HOT DAMN the Sauce. On point. Slight  spice, heavy tomato, and perfect balance of sweetness and acidity. I want this Sauce to be the default flavor of my mouth. Told the staff they were crushing it on the way out. The owner was there and said thank you that he really appreciates it. We talked a bit about BBQ and how Vegas is lacking good BBQ options. He said they run their smokers literally 7days a week all hours just to keep up - they actually smoke everything: no short cuts. And I learned that they actually bring the wood they use to smoke in from Texas, as the desert wood out here just doesn't cut it. If you're skeptical, come taste the difference it makes. It's apparent after just one life changing bite. If there is a heaven, this is the barbeque they serve within the pearly gates. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Damn good and I've been craving it since the minute I left.  Stopped by Big B's while searching for a good hamburger in the area.  BBQ just sounded better.  It smelled amazing, so I got really excited about the prospect of some good smoked meats, which is not an easy find in this town.  Staff greeted us immediately and patiently answered all questions.  Great service.  The owner and his wife were also present and they stopped by the table to make sure everything was going well.    Huge menu, variety of sides and very reasonable prices.  The portions were very big.  They also have draft and bottled beer, including Shinerbock.  Better yet, they have delicious fresh-brewed sweet tea. I lived in the South for 8 years and it's hard to find that type of sweet tea outside of there.  This place nailed it.  I chose the brisket and tri-tip combo with mac and cheese and corn bread.  The meats were extraordinarily tender and were so good that they didn't even need sauce.  Their sauce is very good, not too sweet and just tangy enough for me.  The corn bread was moist, and the mac and cheese was creamy without being over the top.   The meal was fantastic.  They ship in their wood from Texas and you can absolutely taste the difference that makes in the meat.  It's a very casual place with 2 and 4-top tables and large picnic tables inside for large parties.  I was terribly impressed that they have modified picnic tables to accommodate wheelchair guests.    Definitely recommend.",

We ordered 1lb of brisket, full rack of bbribs, 4pc quarter chicken and two sausage links(one of each). The price came to $71.98. The amount that came home looked extremely small for the amount paid. The sausage links were delicious but other than that everything was awful. Dry, no flavor beyond the intense over cooked smoked flavor. The bbq sauce,if you can call it that, was watery. I've never been so disappointed in a bbq joint. Also the stench of the over smoked meat will be with us for days. Now I'm hungry and out a good chunk of money.",

Tri Tip, beef ribs and their chicken are my favorites.   Sides are decent, really wish they had a mixed veggie just to have something at least close to healthy. Corn bread is extra too which is kind of a bummer.I'd settle for a smaller piece of corn bread if it was part of normal side selection.  Everyone is super nice and the atmosphere is great.

    "text": "The quintessential method for determining barbecue worthiness is the brisket the place kicks out. Based solely on the quality of its brisket, this place deserves a solid 5 star. The brisket is that good! Other factors, however, contributed to a lower score.  The potato salad was too mustardy and had potato chunks that were way too large. The chunks should be cut in half or smashed up a little bit better, and the ratio of mustard should be diminished. Nothing worse than too much mustard in the potato salad.  The baked beans were horrendous. Too many different varieties of beans with chunks of meat thrown in. Totally misses the point of baked beans.   Hotlinks actually were delicious also, so at least this place does a really good job in its meat. It's the other issues that are not quite up to par.  I'll definitely be back for brisket and other meats, but next time I'll try different sides.  EDIT: Reduced rating to a 3 star rating as that is more in line with my general approach to rating restaurants. This place is not a 4-star restaurant.",

My husband is a weight lifter and he needs his protein, needless to say he was a happy camper.  He ordered 3 meat plate and I ordered the 2 meat. Let me just say the ribs, pulled pork, fries and cornbread I received were moist, flavorful, savory and just plain delicious.  My husband was so happy.  We usually go out for Friday night date night, but we decided to have date night out in instead.  So, we decided on delivery.  We were tired of the regular Chinese food and pizza, wings and subs that we usually have and tried something new. So glad we did.",

You order your food and they make it as you sidle on down the counter to the end where you pay for your grub. We shared the meat platter. Pork, trii tip, and brisket. Pork was had a great smoke to it and had a great flavor. Their house sauce was the best we tried and it added the tang I was expecting from a good sauce. Brisket pulled apart nicely and had a good ring and deep flavor. Now I am not normally a fan of smoked tri tip because it is not easy to get tender after a long smoke, they succeeded and it was really good. We had slaw which was more on the vinegar side than I like but it was crisp and gave the balance needed. BBQ beans were good and Mac and Cheese was just average.    Thanks for Dining at Big B's Texas BBQ. We would go back and try the other meats and deserts. If in Henderson and need a BBQ fix give it a try.",

The food made me and my taste buds really satisfied. The bathrooms are really nice as well. What really caught my eye was that there were park benches instead of booths or tables. I thought that was really creative and help set the country-like mood. I'm definitely coming back!",

    "text": "For a place that claims to be \"Texas BBQ,\" the brisket was overdone and seriously lacked seasoning (and smokiness).   On the other hand, the turkey and tri-tip were seasoned properly, but were on the over smoked side. The first few bites were good, but then the ash tray like flavor one gets from wood that's smoldering and not completely ablaze set in. Overwhelming and unappetizing.   Sausage was snappy and spicy. Easily the best part of the meal.   Mac and cheese: super cheesy and quite tasty. Beans: ultra sweet and gummy. Potato salad: dry with store bought like flavors.   On the plus side, they serve sweet tea and all the employees were very friendly.   Even though it's close to my house, I'd rather drive the extra 30 minutes to Rollin' Smoke and get considerably better barbecue.  ***UPDATE***  Someone from Big B's responded to my review. Since I can't directly respond, I'll do so here:  I'm not suggesting that you undercook your meat. I'm not really suggesting that you do anything. If you want your meat to taste the way it does and that is your taste, so be it. I know the difference between meat smoked with wood that's completely combusting and wood that's just smoldering. Yours tastes like the latter. The first few bites are good, but then it starts to get strong and overwhelming.   Simple seasoning does not equal little taste. I tasted no salt or pepper or anything on the brisket. It wasn't bad, just lacked flavor.  Also, the turkey obviously at least had salt on it or it was brined (and there is nothing wrong with brining anything).   I don't think that you bought anything from the store, just that it sort of has a store bought taste. My main issue with the potato salad was that it was dry.   I, by no means, am trying to tell you guys how to do anything. I've eaten good barbecue all over this country, barbecue at home for myself, and have become spoiled with what I think is good. No offense meant at all. Obviously, you guys have a huge following and an overall great score on Yelp. Just here to give my honest opinion.",

    "text": "Came to Big B's today and was pretty impressed with the overall food and really good service. walking in the smell permeating from this place smells heavenly. Something about the smell of meat smoking for hours is just magical. For me really picky about BBQ and I can be somewhat snobby but I will give credit where credit is due. I ordered the 3 meat plate which consisted of beef ribs, brisket and baby back ribs. My eyes where way bigger than my stomach based on the amount of food and I was borderline hangry. After a very short wait the food came out and it smelled amazing and looked the same. The smoke ring on the brisket you can tell these guys have some care for the art and craft of great BBQ. I first dove into the brisket and had great smokey flavors and was super tender and delicious. after a few pieces I really wanted to get into the beef ribs. I love beef ribs and so many places don't know how to cook these right. For me these are the unicorns of great BBQ. Well they tasted absolutely magical as well. They where so tender and great smokey flavor as well.  After now being in a small meat coma I had to try these baby backs. Now they serve these bare which I like and you can dress them with their either spicy ( I would highly recommend), their signature sauce which was also delicious and a real treat a South Carolina style mustard based sauce. All of these were so good and can't pick a real favorite because they were all so good. The only ding I would give were for the baby backs. I love a traditional smoked rib and these while smoked fell off the bone which either shows they boiled them, cooked in the oven or left over from the day before. They were just OK for me and really not loving them all too much. They did have a nice smokey flavor they were just not my thing. If you like this style of rib you wont be disappointed....  Overall experience here was fantastic...everyone who works here is super friendly and I would highly recommend. This place is the real deal and the guys here really got it together. In a town that you are competing with casinos its worth driving off strip to give Big B's Texas BBQ a try.",

I called this place again and the same girl answered and I explained I did not receive the burnt ends.    She stated this time that she put them on the ticket for the cooks but they must be out of them....why could she not tell me this before I placed the order? This is the level of customer service provided?  Very disappointed with this lack of customer care.  This is not the first time but I believe this will be my last time giving this place my business.  The food was decent and everyone who tried it did like the taste of the food.  The owner did message me and state that burned ends is not something they have on the menu or sell, so all employees should be aware of what this business offers.  So in closing, they do not have burned ends, the rest of the food is good so I recommend you try this place and leave your own opinion of your experience, I just had a group of people that really wanted burned ends and we were disappointed to find out it was not in our order and I now understand why it was not, they don't offer them.  Lastly I do have a LOT of respect for a business owner who looks at Yelp and replies, it shows a lot of pride in the business.",

The decoration and ambiance \"Very Country\" is incredible so put on the plaid shirt,  cowboy boots and enjoy the Texas Style BBQ Feast.  The Staff was very professional, brought food to the table in a very timely manner, and checked back to make sure all was OK and to see if we needed anything else.  The food, OMG the baby back ribs were so tender and loaded with meat, and the serving size filled you up enjoying each bight.  I love my ribs, baked beans and pasta salad.  You got to get it!  Yum!  I have been to a lot of ribs places and Big B's Texas BBQ is right up there with the Best!  A must go for the entire family or even after a sporting event, bring the team!  Great Job guys!  God Speed!  Jake Out For Now!",

The food was fantastic!!!! They know about BBQ quite well.  That was our first time at Big B's and we'll definitely be going back for some tasty and yumz BBQ The place is spacious, lots of seating area and they also have good drinks selection. Shiner Bock on tap def my favorite. If you love Texas BBQ you've got to try this place!  Thank you so much for the great time there.",

That mustard BBQ sauce.. yes please... A L L  D A Y.  Easy 5 stars, but unfortunately, since about March/April 2019, the sides have dropped off.  The normally flawless potato salad isn't the same; as with the pasta salad.  Ingredient changes, different folks making it, tweaked based on customer feedback, etc. would be my best guess as to why.  I hope those original sides come back, it's what really set you folks apart from the rest; and the only reason why you dropped to 4 stars.",

Cornbread taste like a muffin and not the authentic square cut.  I like how you can choose lean brisket or moist (fattier) brisket.  Ribs are very good and so is the pulled pork.  To Big B's: I would suggest a more home made corn bread and not one made in a muffin tray.  Also, I had to refill my drink 4 times.  The cup is small.  Bbq cups should be big!  I was disappointed being that their was no pickles, peppers or onion fixin' bar and didnt even give me any on my plate.  I would suggest pickles being out by the drinks and hot sauce available.    That being said,  the place is large and clean. Plenty of seating, parking and super nice people/staff.  I would def recommend and come back!",

The potato salad had very big chunks of potato that were hard to eat without cutting and some chunks weren't cooked all the way through.

    "text": "We lived in Austin for five years and had our share of great to fair BBQ. This rates up there with the greats like Franklins and Rudys. We are rather picky, and this place is outstanding.   This is the most authentic Texas experience you will find outside of TX for BBQ. Sit at picnic tables, rolls of paper towels, smells of BBQ smokehouse waft thru air, served on butcher/wax paper and trays. Sweet Tea and Shiner is on tap.   The food is great: Brisket, chicken and ribs and smoked turkey. Sides were really good: BBQ beans, creamed corn. Portions are very big.  Service was excellent. Everyone there was friendly, and very hospitable, including the owner.   Can't wait to see this place continue to thrive.",

The food is really here, the price is a little high when you first look at it but when you get your food it's well worth the money. I've been here 3 or 4 times and I bring my friends with everytime when we have our military drill weekend. I would recommend the 2 meat if you're really hungry if you are looking for something to just eat get the 1 meat you'll definitely have more than enough. The sides are really good as well, their cornbread and bake beans are the best in my opinion. Overall great place and very good food. A bit pricey but like just said the food you get makes up for the price.",

I asked where the sides were and she said the fries and okra would come. Fries came, I asked about okra...they said it was coming up.  I completely finished my meal and no okra. So I informed them and asked that I get banana pudding togo in its place. I waited a few minutes...they brought me (only) okra.  After I was finished with my meal, it was too late for okra...it got cold and went in the trash.  It is a 20 min drive from me, if the service had been good, I'd probably go back...but I don't want to drive that far for poor service even if the food is good.  Too many good places to eat in Las Vegas to put up with that. (By the way...they had 4 employees and 3 tables at the time). 13 July about 1120.",

The ribs were nicely done--fell off the bone; the cole slaw and potato salad were fair and the baked beans were pretty good. These are dry rub ribs so there's no sauce on them at all--you can add the very vinegary one on the table but it was not to our taste. The big problem for us though was the smoke in the place--it was horrible!!  I've been in forest fires that were less smoky. My hair, skin and clothes were completely permeated and my clothes had to go to the cleaners to get the smoke out. Far too high a price to pay for a rib dinner. I would never go there again due to the smoke which they said only happens when they take the smoked meats from their ovens. Why not vent to the outside?? Crazy!",

The 3 meat plate was waaaaaay more food than I could come close to eating.  I was happy with the quality of all the foods and flavors offered.       The owner constantly walks the floor to make sure you are enjoying your meal and offers to refill your drinks. Everyone in our party was beyond satisfied and will definitely be returning.  It is amazing that people have bad things to say on yelp once they leave, yet in a place like this restaurant where staff and owners are more than wanting you to enjoy your meal and be accommodating you sit in silence to go home and complain.  From an honest man I say make the time to stop in and try this restaurant and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did.",

We each ordered the 2  meat plate which comes with two sides. He ordered chicken and tri-tip with mac & cheese and bbq beans for his sides. I ordered pulled pork and brisket, with coleslaw and bbq beans as my sides.  We each ordered a side of cornbread. When ordering the brisket I was asked if I would like it lean or moist. Anybody who has had brisket will know the difference! I ordered the moist which has more fat thus giving it more flavor. We were very pleased with the quality of food and the generous portions. The coleslaw is outstanding, and I consider myself somewhat of  coleslaw snob!  Unfortunately they had run out of cornbread and offered us either an additional side or a refund of our money. We each ordered an additional side. I had Mac & cheese and he had French fries. The owner came by the table to see if everything is okay and I told him they were out of cornbread, which was disappointing as I love good cornbread. He seemed genuinely miffed at the fact that they had run out stating that should never have happened and apologized profusely. The atmosphere is pleasant, Comfortable and friendly. He has hired on a great staff who seem to take the job seriously and genuinely care about a positive guest experience. We will definitely be back",

It's $2 more at $17.99. Big Difference! Come on people! Three of us went to try it out last night, first time for all of us. It was good. Between us we had (and I tried everything): tri tip - it was moist, good and I would get it anytime. The brisket - moist, good, fatty piece on top that I'd expect. Smoked turkey - VERY good. I'd get this every time. Cheddar and jalapeno sausage - good, but VERY spicy. I eat jalapeno poppers etc, but this was much hotter, so be warned. We also had creamed corn, mac n cheese, and fried okra. All very good. The least fave was the creamed corn. It seemed that it was too thick, we were there about 6:30pm so maybe it had sat there too long on a warmer, not sure. But way too thick. I thought the plates should have come with bread, but we didn't get any bread with ours, and were never offered bread. I thought from other reviews we would get a slice of bread, and since we paid $2 more than the menu price I would have thought we would get a slice of bread but oh well. The other small problems: 2 of us wanted a glass of draft beer. The lady said that for a dollar more we could get a pitcher and it would be about 5 beers. So we got the pitcher and it was exactly 3 cups of beer. So she was either told WAY wrong or they are trying to upsell by lying. Not sure. But I guess it is still a deal. But for just one more beer I wouldn't have got it. Also the sauces... They have a sweet sauce that has basically no hot spice, and a honey mustard. I like a little more kick though. I asked the gal that brought our food if they have something a little more spicy and she went and got a chipotle sauce. Ok this was like fire in your mouth. They need a regular spicy bbq sauce. I sure hope the owner reads this and fixes his website and the small things listed here to make it a better place.",

    "text": "Awesome, I tried the brisket meat plate, with fries and potato salad, my partner had the trip tip with beans as a side, of the sides I enjoyed the beans the most, they were very well seasoned. Brisket was very nice and moist. Their sauces were both on the sweeter side but not overly so, i enjoyed them even though I normally go for a spicier style it was a nice change. Great experience overall the staff were very friendly and helpful with ordering. My only regret is I wish I had eaten there to enjoy the ambiance and have my meal fresh and hot.",

    "text": "I've been looking for a place to rival Rollin Smoke in the Henderson area, if you are too, this is not the BBQ you're looking for.  I was torn, I really would rate is 2.5, but for the sake of it being a new business I'll round up. I got the three meat plate, brisket and pulled pork and  upgraded one meat to a half slab for $4.  It's decent, but not flavorful enough for me. Maybe it's the type you have to drown in BBQ sauce (they offer a mustard based and a ketchup based, of the two I prefer the ketchup based) and I only got one of each to go.  I like my brisket on the verge of falling apart and this wasn't tough, but it wasn't about to fall apart either. The ribs were fall off the bone so that's a plus to me.  The mac N Cheese is excellent, better than most BBQ spots. The creamed corn is good too.  I always try a BBQ place twice so hopefully the second time is better than the first. More flavor in the spice rubs please!",

The ribs were great as was the brisket. They had tons of different sauces to choose from...I liked the spicy Texas sauce the best..it was kick! The reason for the 4 stars were the sides...very disappointing! The potato salad was weird, coleslaw we all tried and nobody liked, the beans tasted like they were in a bbq sauce soup. Very heavy and overwhelmingly not good. Prices are steep, meats are great, avoid the sides...",

I love brisket and I couldn't more disappointed. It was way over cooked and chewy. Must've been a bad day for the cooks. I also got the smoked meetloaf and it was smokey and red in the middle. Must've only been smoked to 110 degrees or something. It had good potential, but was gross. The best thing honestly tonight we're the French fries. I'm giving it 2 stars only because the people were beyond nice. I would never recommend this place. Good luck to the rest of you.",

    "text": "I like this place. They have only been open about a week, so still working out the kinks but my visit today around 11:30am on a Tuesday was a very pleasant dining experience. Their hours are 11am to 10pm.  Its located just west of the Hospital, very close to Raising Canes, on the south side of St. Rose Pkwy. Parking lot is big, plenty of available parking.   When you walk in you see a lot of wooden picnic tables (12) and a few tables made from wooden spools in a very large space. Plenty of room for everyone! They have several large screen tv's around so you can watch sports on them. They do serve beer, as well as the 100 flavor soda machine, sweet and regular ice teas.   Their menu is pretty extensive, brisket, tri tip, baby back ribs, pork loin, pulled pork, chicken, turkey, links and more. They do meat plates (1,2 or 3 choices), sandwiches, etc. Lots of sides to choose from.   I went with the two meat plate ($13.99) with brisket and tri tip (where's the beef? on my plate!)  with a side of corn on the cob and BBQ beans. You get a couple slices of bread with that as well. Good old family style BBQ plate with plenty of food. I liked the fact that when you ordered the meat they pulled a section out of a warmer oven, and sliced it for you. For me the tri tip was delicious, moist and a good smoky flavor, although a bit on the cool side temperature wise. The brisket was chopped, and my serving was a bit dry and not as good smoky flavor. Reading other reviews I think its worth another try. The BBQ beans have two different style beans in a sweet sauce with jalapeno (?) and big chunks of brisket. The corn on the cob was not burnt like in other photos here, had a touch of smoky flavor, just needed butter. Two sauces, one a vinegar/ketchup base and the other a mustard base were on the tables. Neither sauce wow'd my personal taste buds, but worked nicely with the meats.  I had a nice interaction with the serving staff, they were all friendly and helpful. The owner Brian had just left but his kind wife was there to answer a lot of my questions and even took me back to show me the smoker unit. They have a multi-layer smoker, use mostly mesquite and oak woods, and maintain temperatures from 225 to 250. She said it takes a bit getting used to this smoker and cooking times, so I expect as they continue to cook it will get really good. She also told me they started off with one rotation of meats and found out they were running out around 6pm so now they do 2 rotations. Pretty much someone is there 24 hours a day. The entire back area was clean and well organized. They actually drive to Texas 2 times a year to load up on wood as its hard to find here or really expensive.   I'll be back for sure. I look forward to a great sample of the brisket, as well as trying the porks, ribs, and chicken. Prices are fair for Vegas. When you tip, the entire staff yells out \"Beer Money\" so tip well.",

    "text": "Best Brisket in Las Vegas!! (And it's not even close).  For the past several years, there seems to be a plethora of BBQ restaurants poppin' up in the Valley. And each one claims to have a different regional style when it comes to their BBQ, and many places carry similar items, but done with their own personal taste. While there are places doing good ribs (Rollin' Smoke) or good pork (Jessie Rae's), there is not one single place in town doing good brisket. Except today, when I went into Big B's Texas BBQ.  I saw this new business when Heather N. checked into here. Always on the lookout for good BBQ, and I noticed it was close to where I was at the time, I noticed it was around lunch, so I had to get my grub on.  It's located behind the Raising Cane's on St. Rose Pkwy, there is a lot of parking so don't worry about it. After walking in, I knew I was in the right place. Even though there is a little bit more finishing up when it comes to the interior, it does scream Texas style BBQ. Sort of like that BBQ place that was on the King of the Hill cartoon (Sugarfoot's?). Anyways, after ordering some meats, paid my bill, then sat down.  Brisket - Man.. that is some brisket. Not only the best brisket in Vegas, but one of the best ones I've ever had in my life. I'm sure a Texas BBQ connoisseur would probably be more qualified to talk about the subject, but I really like a very tender brisket, and that is what is missing from all the other spots in town. There is an actual 'smoke ring' that you can see on it. It wasn't plain or dry. It was truly a spectacle to behold.  Tri-tip - I had a old friend who attended UT at Austin back in the day, and I asked him if tri-tip was as popular as brisket. He said he really didn't see it that much. I did some research and found out that it was more of a California thing. But the way that Big B's does tri-tip, Texas should think about adopting the tri-tip as part of their BBQ style, because the one at Big B's is phenomenal. Absolutely tender, and it just melted, and that smoke ring doe.... I was just floored.  The sauces were great as well. I personally don't like a BBQ that's so sugary sweet, I liked that Big B's was more about spice, and subtle amounts of sweetness, and complexity of flavor. There are two of them, a red and orange colored one, and I liked swirling both of them, and playing with them on top of my brisket and tri-tip.  Texan's know their beef and Big B's knows how to cook it correctly. If you're tired of dry, flavorless brisket in Vegas, I would definitely recommend this spot. I would also like to see some reviews by some Texan transplants to see if I'm right, or just crazy. Probably just crazy.",

We actually had the opportunity to taste some Big B's Texas BBQ at a Hurricane Harvey Fundraiser at Casa Shenandoah.  We enjoyed it then and kept meaning to go to their restaurant in Henderson.  Last Friday, our opportunity arose.  The entire experience felt like home...from the Shiner Bock to the BBQ and sauce.  The brisket was done to perfection with a smokey ring.  It was melt in your mouth good and definitely not dry.  No sauce necessary!  I also had the hot links which were delicious.  My boyfriend had the chicken and brisket and said both were great.    To be honest, the only thing missing was the slice of bread or bun, sliced onions and sliced pickles that you ALWAYS get with Texas BBQ at home.    We will be back!  Thanks Y'all!",

The first thing that hits you as you walk in is the aroma, something good is cooking. The tough part is then deciding what smells so good that you don't want to order the wrong thing. After numerous visits I can say it's all as good as it smells! If you've been eating ribs at chain restaurants you'll wonder how Big B's finds pigs with more than twice the meat. It's not fancy but it shouldn't be, good food at a good price.",

Not every bbq restaurant has beef ribs due to the cost, so I am always on the look out for a place that serves them.  The brisket was juicy and flavorful and they have beer on tap.  My wife and I split a meal and it cost under $25 and we are so full!",

I had to send the mac/cheese back, as it was extremely watery. It also lacked flavor. The server was very nice and advised there were several patrons who had sent back their mac n cheese for the same issue. So, not sure if it was a bad batch. Why even serve it?   Turkey was great! Very moist and flavorful. The baby back ribs were dry.   The staff is very nice and professional.",

I ordered the tri- tip with beans and Cole slaw as my sides - a Number 2 plate in their menu terminology.   The half pound portion of beef was sliced thin which helped make it fork tender to eat and was moist and delicious. The beans were served piping hot and had abundant chunks of burnt ends mixed in a combo of two or three types of beans. One drawback for me was the sauce for the beans was overly sweet - I would like to see a spicy version offered with jalapenos and a less sugar based sauce. Cole slaw was unremarkable.",

If you show them the yelp app, you get a feee side! Service is also great, friendly and personable!

I had corn on cob, fried okra, corn bread, and Mac and cheese.  Neither of us liked the mac and cheese and ended up throwing it in the trash. It was over cooked macaroni with too much sauce. The corn had absolutely no flavor, even after adding butter and salt! The corn bread was served room temp to almost cold, normally I would expect it to be at least warm.  Staff was very friendly and husband did enjoy the tri-tip. The atmosphere is very clean and nice for its guests. So overall, it's average and I am undecided.",

I'm now a fan!  Returned for a second visit. Inconsistent is the key word.  Ribs were dry and brisket didn't resemble the brisket the first time around.  The benchmark for ribs has been set by Fox Smokehouse in Boulder City and by Jessie Rae's in Vegas n Henderson.  The ribs failed to meet those standards.   Was very disappointed by the inconsistency on my second visit and therefore adjusted my rating.",

Fried okra was fresh, very well seasoned, super good. Mac and cheese is more white in color, smooth, creamy, with no processed cheese flavors. White or wheat bread came with our plates also.

Now I finally have a place to go to where the barbecue is far superior than anything that I could cook or is available in Vegas. You know they're serious about the barbecue when Big B drives to Texas just to get his wood! What more needs to be said! Large portions of perfectly smoked meats, amazing sides, and multiple types of sauce........ Pure BBQ Heaven!!! My two absolute favorites are the Beef Ribs and the BBQ Beans. I'm actually getting hungry while I write this review.... So I'm on my way over. Damn that's twice this week! Keep up the good work Big B!!",

The brisket is full of flavor without any sauce and melts in your mouth...the True sign of good BBQ, even the bread is fresh. The mac and cheese is amazing even when reheating and the corn is a full cob. Only thing that could make me love this place more? Banana pudding, blue bell ice cream and bbq baked potatoes.

    "text": "First, we are from the central coast of California where \"Santa Maria style\" tri-tip barbecue was born at Jocko's in Nipomo. Until today, I thought the only place for excellent barbecued tri-tip.  We had the great pleasure to enjoy an outrageously good lunch with our daughter and her family at Big B's in Henderson! We were first greeted with a very pleasant young lady who asked if we'd ever been there before. With our indication that we were new to the establishment, she asked if we wanted to sample three of the meats they serve -- turkey, brisket and tri-tip. What? Who does that???   Anyway, each of the samples were exquisite! I stuck with ordering the tri-tip in my smugness that only the good tri-tip is prepared and served on the central coast.   Regardless of the meats we all had ordered, it melted in our mouths! Yum!  The sides were equally delicious, with more than you can eat in one sitting.  In closing, about a quarter of the way through the meal, one of the staff members came to the table with freshly prepared macaroni and cheese for those who had ordered it as a side. She said that she wasn't thoroughly happy with the quality of what was initially served, so she had prepared four piping hot servings! Who does that???  If you want excellent BBQ, exceptional customer service, big boy servings, and all at a fair price, go to Big B's Texas BBQ on St. Rose in Henderson!!!",

I went with the 2 meat with Brisket (Great!) and Jalapeno Sausage (Ok - go with the tri-tip next time) and Mac n Cheese (Great! Very cheesy), Beans (Great! Spicy with meat inside) and Potato Salad (Good, not a fan of peppers, but they were big enough to pick out) for sides. They also gave me a nice sample of the Pull Pork (Awesome) Everything was hot juicy and awesome!!  I'll be back for sure!!!",

Everything was amazing even the sides.   I would definitely come here again. Venue is good for large dinner parties as well.",

Pulled pork was good as well as the corn bread (muffin??).  Cool atmosphere but I came for the food and eehhhhhh. I guess plenty of TX folks, like Kirkbride, that'll support the business.  Update:  the person taking my order did ask if I wanted dry or wet brisket and I assumed (I know, my fault) that wet implied with sauce.  I suppose I should've asked the difference of the two.",

So much that they were probably a bit louder than they should have been. Gentleman came over and offered them ice cream if they'd settle down- on the house!

The tri tip-couldn't have been better. Perfectly cut, seasoned, and moist. Absolutely perfect. ORDER THE TRI TIP.   2. The cornbread-good, not great. Flavor was very good, but cold and not overwhelming.   3.  The beans-good, not great. Good flavor, but surprising complete lack of meat or burnt ends in them. Quite sweet.   The decent:  4. Mac n cheese-just underwhelming on every level. Not hot, not that creamy, and no crunchy texture anywhere.   The bad:  5. Ribs-so bland, dry, and forgettable that I find it very hard to believe I had no problem paying a $5 up-charge to get a half rack as a meat. Do not order the ribs. Do NOT order the ribs.  All in all, it's a pretty good barbecue spot. The trip tip was incredible, but the ribs were awful. For $28, there are better bbq options in the city (rolling smoke). However, if you want something slightly better than the chains we have here, give this place a shot.",

Very nice and prompt with service.   Now, on to the main menu. They have a nice selection and reasonable prices. Their sides are amazing. We had cream corn and I watched others get their sides and they all looked good. I didn't care for the baked beans but they weren't bad. Just not my cup of Tea.   Now, onto the meats. We had the chicken, ribs and pork. They all were fall off the bone tender and a great smokey flavor. However, they are just smoked. NO seasoning or sauce at all. I prefer a dry rub seasoning. I tried their sauces they were a little to bland for me. I prefer a rich sweet BBQ sauce. Their sauces are runny and lacked in flavor. The Mustard sauce tasted like vinegar, a little Mustard and a gallon of Black Pepper. Also, the cornbread was soooo dry! I did really enjoy the Peach Cobbler and it was a great price at 2.99.   All in all I will come back for the cobbler and sides. I might try the meats again but just to go. So, I can use my own sauce. I hope they make the small changes and this place could be phenomenal.",

Everyone always seems very confused, and I just don't know why. It seems like the ordering process is pretty straight forward but boy does it always cause confusion!! Today there were four people staring at a tray with the order ticket in their hand, trying to figure out if the order was correct! I had a to-go order, and had to wait about 10 minutes which seemed like a long time for an ordinary (not large) order to go. And then I got home and they had given me tri tip instead of brisket. I should have checked the order, especially after sitting watching pure chaos for 10 minutes, lol. Luckily I like the tri tip, but I really wanted brisket.   Bottom line is it's 5 star food, but less than stellar service.",

To begin with, I've never seen BBQ that looked like it was being served at McDonalds...as in all perfectly proportioned and processed. The tri-tip and brisket looked exactly the same, except for the size of the slices...and tasted exactly the same too. If you like to pick pieces of cushion from the slice in the couch and eat them, I highly recommend this place.   The chicken wasn't much better..but edible. I'm not sure how they made corn bread taste so bland, but I'm curious, because I didn't think it was possible. However, the coleslaw was amazing...not because it was really good, but because it actually had a flavor, and that made us very happy.",

My roommates tried out Big B's and came home in meat comas and still drooling.  I finally went and it was worth every single review!  I don't eat beef or pork, so having two poultry choices was wonderful.  The fried okra is to die for!  My friend got the pulled pork and tri-tip..her eyes glazed over.  She said it was amazing and is rather picky on just about everything she eats.  And the best part, they have Shiner Bock on tap!!   Pardon me as I slip into my food coma.",

Mac and cheese, good but it was a bit gritty. Probably from not cooking the roux enough but that at least says it's homemade so I'll take the grit.  Potato salad was pretty damn good. Definitely homemade and full of salady potatoey stuff.  Brisket was meh. Kinda bland. No dry rub that I could taste.  Hot link was great. Spicy and a great snap. Hopefully it's homemade.  Chicken was void of any seasoning. Looked great but really could use some salt on the skin. Great smoke taste though.  The staff was all very friendly and genuinely happy to help. The restaurant was clean and very open. Great for big parties.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but they are new and I wish them the best of luck being a local businesses. With time I'm hoping their smoker gets more seasoned as does their meat.",

I got onions, pickles, and jalapenos on the side. Two side choices, custom made Mac n cheese and French fries of course. Couple slices of bread and a side of ranch. $10. And worth every penny. Added a drink. And with tax it was about $15. I threw a small tip on there because they do bring it out to you but drinks, silverware, etc is self serve. You also dump your own tray.

I definitely wasn't disappointed. I had the Brisket & sausage, and the Brisket was spot on and very moist. My only critique is that I like my Brisket sliced in thick strips, which I believe it was but it was so moist it fell apart. Not a bad thing since it still rocked. Sides and sausage were spot on as well and the sauces were great. The atmosphere gave me flashbacks to Texas right away & the staff was friendly & welcoming. Great place.",

This time  $50 order and the BBQ sauce spills in the bag they serve it to me anyways... slippery,soggy and disgusting. I also ordered the well done brisket but got the fatty tender brisket which we didn't want on all three orders. Frustrating when you're dropping BBQ sauce thru your house to get it in the kitchen.then the guy just looked at me like I wasn't worthy of clean takeout utensils and bags after I tipped 20% and asked if he would be ok with paying $50 for an order that looked this sloppy.",

The smell of smoking wood makes your mouth fall as you look at the meats behind counter! We ordered a couple of plates with the baby back ribs, brisket & pork that have been dry rubbed & slowly smoked being extremely tender & delicious without needing any sauce to flavor them up although there's both a tangy BBQ sauce & tangy mustard sauce on tables that are good & went great with the fried okra I ordered. I enjoyed the lean brisket so much I had to order a lb. of after finishing dinner to snack on later. Will definitely be back soon!",

There was nothing wrong with the food but for 21.89 for a three meat plate with a soft drink is over priced when it's served on a red plastic tray with a piece of paper that the order was written on in between it and the food and the cutlery is flimsy plastic. Dickies BBQ is better value any day of the week. Though these guys' brisket was better than dickies but not 5$ better. 5$ extra for ribs = another ri(b) off (get it ;-) ). Cheap decor. One kind of rather boring BBQ sauce. I think this was set up to be a money making machine and I bet it is but I don't think it will be for long.",

It got here hot, the meat was tender and tasty (although I would have liked a touch more seasoning).  The barbeque sauce that came on the side was fabulous, sweet with a little tang.  The sides were tasty.  My house now smells like amazing BBQ.  The driver from the delivery service was pleasant and actually showed up quite a bit sooner than the expected arrival time.  My family and I will definitely be ordering from here again.  It's also close to my work, so I will be telling my coworkers about this place.

Each sauce had it's own distinguishable flavor that made it really stand out from the rest.",

I'm just a simple blue collar working man on the road in that hot summer sun with my grandpa when all of a sudden there it was clear as day. Big b's Texas bbq. \"Well this is almost too good to be True\" I thought. So let's head on inside. The rest of that afternoon it was just me, ma, grandpa and grandma, and a big ol plate of succulent pulled pork. We tried the whole gambit: ribs, pork, cornbread and pecan pie and man...what a night. This is my go to place for barbecue by far. It's open, cool, friendly environment never fails to put a smile on my face. This summer quench that hankering the country way at Big B's",

Brisket was a little dry and they seemed like they were still looking for their rhythm. Staff seemed a little confused about how the orders were going to get completed, but in the end got it done, and served us quickly. The kids liked that all the staff were wearing flannel shirts.

I've eaten an obscene amount of brisket over the years including in Texas, and this stands up to Texas brisket. However, the staff were kind of unorganized when it came to processing the orders, which I think will improve with time. They were friendly at least. Also, the sides need work. The fries were ok but lacked seasoning, the corn on the cob was burnt and without butter, and the mac n cheese had too much smoke flavor. The last time I ordered it, I couldn't eat it because it was the texture of mac but the taste of campfire smoke. Reel it in, folks. Dairy is delicate. I hope they improve the sides so that this can become my go-to bbq joint. (We need this in Vegas!) For now I'll just order the meat, though.",

Lucille's was ok but very \"chain-like.\"  Then came Bell's BBQ which was like that date that you really wanted to like but just didn't feel anything there.  Finally, this BBQ place is the real deal.  If you noticed, most of the bad reviews were from people ordering the sliders or the po boy.  The sandwich is definitely the weakest (and cheapest) part of the menu.  Go for the pure BBQ - ribs, chicken, tri tip without the bread.  What they call \"hot\" sauce really wasn't that hot but it had a nice kick to it.  My only complaint is that they mailed out menus and it was clear that the person who came up with the pricing didn't think it through very clearly and you could easily \"game\" the menu.  When you showed up to order, they wouldn't honor the price.  It was only $1 but it left a bad taste.  You lost a lot of enthusiasm (and a star) over a buck.",

The portion sizes were Texas- huge!! (Everything is bigger in Texas!!) at first we thought it was pricey but then we saw how much meat we got and it is TOTALLY WORTH IT. The combos are a steal! And actually quite a deal, seriously, meat is expensive. The staff was so incredibly kind and helpful too. We will be back!!   We had so many left overs that it was lunch and dinner the next day. The meat saved so well and was even better the next day.   Highly highly highly recommend!",

A gentleman assisted us to place our order since it was our first time. Guys if you Check-in on yelp, they will offer you a side with your meal (most likely they give you an extra side since their price are set as a menu) We ordered 3 meat plate with 2 sides, Hot link sausage (spicy spicy), brisket (juicy and tender YUM) and some ribs  (+ $5) I expected something more juicy with BBQ sauce  My sides were fries and BBQ beans. Hubby ordered Po Boy with tri-tip (+$1.5) with pasta salad and macaroni & cheese. Po Boy sandwich was little dry... no sauce just bread and meat. He had the souvenir of the Po Boy we had in New Orleans, he was disappointed that it wasn't the same  Honestly I Love meat but if you go for 3 meats plate think of sharing it  I couldn't finished it!  the seating area is like a covered patio with the benches, very nice! Employees were friendly and helpful. I won't eat it everyday but great place if you are craving BBQ meat  They do Monday Football night :) While I was enjoying my order, I was thinking that the restaurant could be a Great Place for a wedding! Catering on site, plenty of parking spaces and the restaurant could accommodate 175 people!!!",

Service is great and the cost is amazingly reasonable.  Big B's is now our go-to BBQ restaurant. Highly recommended. Try it, you'll love it.",

Usually when people think bbq they imagine the sweet Memphis style pork, which is okay but when you want to get serious about meat you should give Texas a try.  The smell of oak smoke in this restaurant immediately gets me primed for some brisket.  The brisket is perfect and the portions are very generous.  You can tell they take pride in their work and it shows.  I'll be back for the beef ribs soon.",

We called ahead and placed an order for a family of 10. They gave us an estimate on when to come and pick it up, and when I arrived they were literally cutting our meats and packaging our side dishes.  We ordered brisket, baby back ribs, pulled pork, and try tip. All of the meets were fantastic, but by far my favorite was the trytip and juicy brisket. And their barbecue sauce was spot on. I did try their \"hot\" sauce - and it was pretty good. I don't think I'd have it again, because it's not my style for barbecue. But it was pretty tasty.  For our side dishes we got macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, and rolls. All of them were exactly as you would hope - - delicious and complementary to the meal.  If you are a fan of barbecue, and you live in and or visit the Henderson/Vegas area, do yourself a favor and stop on by. You won't regret it.",

You order at the counter, and since it was our first visit the young lady explained everything to us. We ended up with a 3 meat plate to share. With 2 sides it was more than enough! The pecan pie at checkout looked yummy too so we added that and a couple of drinks. Prices were very reasonable. So, the food... probably the best pulled pork I have ever had. I ate it without adding anything to it (there are bottles of hot sauce, bbq sauce, and vinegar on the table). The brisket was outstanding too, you can order it moist or dry. The chicken was quite tasty but didn't stand out as much. This is a great bbq place. Wife is from S Texas and she gives it 2 thumbs up! Oh, and we took the pecan pie home to eat since we were stuffed, and it was yummy too!",

They brought out 3 small slices of dry, flavorless brisket, and 2 dry, flavorless pieces of chicken. I've never tasted chicken or brisket with less flavor in my life.   The Mac-n-cheese was fine, the beans weren't for me but atleast they had some flavor. And the size of the sides was pretty good.  This place gets 3 stars for service and atmosphere, but the food was very disappointing considering the 4.5 star average with this many reviews.  Go try Jessie Rae's if you want some real BBQ.. even Famous Dave's beats this place.",

So I met up with some friends for an early dinner and I was excited because I've driven past here a couple times before and the smell alone always kept me wondering how the food was since the smell was amazing!   I walked in and there was no line/no crowd, yay! A super nice gentleman took my order and provided great recommendations. I'm a beef rib kinda girl, so that's exactly what I wanted. I ordered the beef rib dinner ($5 up-charge for ribs, FYI), which came with 2 sides; I tried the fried Okra and Cole Slaw. My meal came out to about $16 which was what I expected but still pretty pricey!   I waited about 10 minutes then someone brought my meal to me. The beef ribs were huge, with tons of meat with a combination of fatty pieces and lean pieces. They had a overpowering burnt charcoal taste so I wish I would have told them not too well done, I like a little rawness to my beef. I think the beef ribs were too well-done for my liking, that's the only complaint. My sides were good, but I really wanted to try the Mac n' cheese, maybe next time.   Overall this place serves up some good bbq, they have 4.5 Stars for a reason. *wink.",

I also had to try the brisket, was impressed that they asked if I wanted lean or fatty brisket.  I chose the fatty brisket as it would hopefully have more flavor.  Was not disappointed, just the right amount of marveling, great mesquite smoke flavor and a hearty bark on the edges.  This second trip I had to try the brisket again to check for consistency, and I really enjoyed again.  Had a couple slices of the tri-tip and that too was good.  My only let down so far was the beef rib.  Flavor was good, but they were borderline chewy and were mostly bone ... these were not the heavy duty beef ribs that you get in the hill country of Texas... Or the beef ribs that Rollin Smoke is serving up here in Vegas.  I'll have go back and try the baby back ribs next time.  Can't wait!",

We walked in and were greeted, directed to the counter where we were pleasantly greeted again. The menu was quickly explained and offered samples prior to making our final decisions. I ordered a two meat plate which came with two sides. Tri-tip and lean brisket with Mac & cheese and Baked beans. Everything was delicious. The environment was pleasant, a subtle amount of smoke filled the restaurant. Every employee we encountered was friendly and attentive. One of the owners was making their rounds and visited our table to ensure everything was to our liking. They even offered us our choice of complimentary dessert. It's refreshing to receive attentive, sincere service, so thank you Big B's. If your in the mood for BBQ, skip the obvious chains. We live in the south-west part of town, it was a 25 minute drive, well worth the drive to patronize a locally owned business run by genuinely nice people.",

The Pulled Pork, Brisket, Tri-tip and Baby Back Ribs are genuine and delicious. The side-dishes I have enjoyed thus far are filled with pleasing flavor.    The care, passion and time invested in each dish are apparent at first bite. The staff demonstrates that same care.

The person I went with said, \"This is the BBQ that Texas doesn't want\" or Kansas City for that matter. The only part that we really liked was the corn on the cob. My brisket was extremely fatty, almost inedible. His ribs still had the plastic coating on the underside. Meaning most likely came from a large distributer. I'm not to big on cheese casserole and that is what their Mac n cheese was for my other side. And my companions was the potato salad and he said it was fine. Not terribly friendly. Liked the atmosphere. But if you are going to have Texas university flags up, don't leave anyone out. Or go all out on one. I have some friends who love it and that's why went, they have even gotten the last two Thanksgivings food from them so.....judge for yourself. Yelp is about personal opinion so I am sorry it offended you Natalia. I have never gotten brisket so fatty I was unaware I had to specify I wanted more meat and less fat. Thanksgiving had nothing to do with it, I had my choice to go other places. B.B was not the only place open. I do commend you for feeding families on Thanksgiving however. There were two guys available obviously working their asses off but no one else even for a cashier.  He told us they would be right there to help us, twice but eventually he had to figure it out. As far as the plastic, it was way too thick to be casing. There is more points to be made but I don't need to justify myself and the points I reference. Your snarky attitude disguised with pleasantries of Thanksgiving will now never make me give you a second chance! Instead I edit my review for the worse.",

I see this place has many good reviews, which is great. We must have caught them on a bad day.  My brisket..was so bad. I understand brisket is a fatty meat, but this literally felt like eating gelatinous, uncooked strips of grey meat. The only flavor it had came from what tasted like liquid smoke, because it lacked that genuine BBQ flavor that only comes from meat that has been cared for in a smoker. Tri tip was also flavorless aside from the liquid smoke aspect.  Don't quite know how you managed to make French fries inedible, but you managed.  The baked beans were literally like bean soup, the broth being straight up runny BBQ sauce.  So I go to my Mac & cheese. Has to be good, right? It's pasta & cheese sauce. Unfortunately it was just...weird tasting. Almost like a gravy with some cheese added. Unexplainably sweet, in some very uncomfortable ways.   I was so hungry when we arrived at this restaurant. So hungry that I regrettably ingested my head cheese-like brisket. I won't be going here again, It was more of a learning experience. There seems to be one hell of a following for this place, but I just don't get it.  If you've actually had real Texas BBQ & know how amazingly delectable it can be, skip this place.",

Now I am pretty sure we will never make the mistake of going to get chicken again.   Everything was fantastic. We got Tri-tip, pulled pork, and the jalapeno cheddar hot link as entrees. All were outstanding but the pork and Tri-tip were some of the best I've ever had. For our sides, we got the Mac n cheese, corn on the cob, BBQ baked beans and creamed corn. I kid you not, the creamed corn was the best side of the lot. Don't miss out; be sure to get it. The beans were a tad spicy but amazing and the mac n cheese was stellar. We also tried the cornbread muffins which were delightful. They have bit of cinnamon in them, which was a nice touch.   The ambience was fantastic. Very cute place with picnic tables/benches, barbecue sauces at the table and rolls of paper towels. The staff was super helpful and friendly and the owner was on site to receive our compliments for the amazing food.   Much of my family is from Texas and this place lives up to its name. We will definitely be back with our appetites and friends!",

    "text": "I wish I could say that I loved this place, but I think 3 stars is a good representation. It's definitely not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it most certainly is not the worst.   We stopped in one afternoon for a quick bite. The first thing you notice is the smell of smoke, large picnic-style tables everywhere, and the loud TV's broadcasting sports (in this case, football). The area was clean and well kept, and the staff were pleasant and very helpful. When asking questions, they were quite knowledgeable about their respective BBQ.  We ordered a #3, which is a 3 meat plate. We requested chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. The chicken was quite good. Tender and smoky, but not too dry (especially because most of the meat was breast meat) which can be difficult to accomplish. The pork I did not really appreciate, as it was drowned in sauce and I could not appreciate the taste of the meat. The brisket was tender and had a nice bark which my husband liked.  All in all I would say that this place is a solid. It really isn't anything out of this world, but it is definitely good for some comfort-style food in Henderson, which can be hard to find!",

I could see dog hair floating in food. I found this disgusting and turn around and left, I guess this is a good place if you are a dog lover and don't mind dog hair in your BBQ. Updating my review these were not service dogs, the man in line in front of me looked like a weight lifter and the dog was a pit bull..",

My only real complaint was the ribs are over cooked. While some people like \"fall off the bone\" ribs, if the bone pulls out clean, it means they're over cooked. They did have a good hint of rub on them. Good flavor but not over powering.   The brisket had no hint of a rub but the meat has a good flavor. That's what I look for, a meat with flavor without sauce.   The okra was fantastic and the slaw was good. A vinegar based slaw and not sweet.   The sauces threw me, being more of a vinegar base and a mustard based. The vinegar again not being my preference is done right.      The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the food they prepare and serve.   Again my detractors are personal flavor choices not them doing anything wrong or it being bad. What they do they do right. If you blast them for say the sauce, again just because you done personally like it doesn't mean it's bad or they messed it up. You just don't like it.   If it wasn't for the over cooked ribs I could have given them a 5 star as this is the only thing \"wrong\" with my meal.",

Perfect smell perfect texture, great staff, friendly cooks. Texas style  restaurant, and decor. The place stunk of BBQ flavor all over the place,,,I was in heaven.  I thought I heard the Bell, like Pavlocks dog,, I was drooling even before I got to the counter.

The tea is great and I liked there was fresh lemon to add to my drink. The cashier was friendly and informative of the process (since this was our first time). I ordered 2 meats (turkey and chicken) with potato salad and corn on the cob. They were out of corn bread so I had white bread. My husband had beef ribs tri tip Mac and cheese with beans and white bread.  I was initially disappointed that we only had plastic utensils to use while dining in. This would be expected if we were taking the order to go. Once we sat down I realized there were only 2 sauces to choose from and I had no butter for my bread or corn. My husband was so kind to get me butter which consisted of 2 small pads of ice cold hard butter. When he went back for more he witnessed employees fighting with each other to get more butter. The chicken had no flavor. The turkey was good. The potato salad was decent (there were too many onions for my liking). The corn was terrible (soft and mushy like it was steamed all day). The tri tip was great. The beef ribs were fall off the bone but still no flavor. The beans were excellent. Mac and cheese was disappointing, bland-not even a cheese flavor.  We will give it one more try and hopefully it will be better. The place has a good atmosphere and they were playing decent music. More sauce options, real utensils, and some seasoning would go a long way. The owners were present and greeting patrons, which was a nice touch.",

    "text": "Drove by this place many times and finally decided to check it out. It's kind of in an obscure location behind Canes and Tommy burger off of St. Rose Pkwy by Eastern. When we first walked in, we immediately liked the set up: Open spacious with picnic tables. We had a coupon for a family meal and it included: 1 pound of pulled pork, 4 quarter leg chicken, 2 Quart of Sides and 6 piece of bread. For the four of us, I thought it might not be enough but I was dead wrong. There was so much food that I had enough for leftovers. I love the casual picnic benches and all the televisions. I bet this place is packed during NFL or NBA seasons. Anyways the food was AMAZING! the chicken melted off the bone with a smoky taste, the pulled pork was moist and the cream corn/potato salad was out of sight. I loved it so much we came back the next week to try the beef brisket and I was not disappointed. In fact, the brisket is my favorite. Oh BTW: there are no plates, you eat off of a tray lined with paper. I love the concept. The only down side is that the drinks are on the pricey side. If you are looking for a fast-casual BBQ place with quality give this place a try. For the price, it beats Famous Daves, for quality it beats Dickies. I will be bringing more of my friends.",

Personally, I couldn't detect the smoke flavor. All the sides I had were bad enough that I tossed them...beans mostly vinegar, for example. Stouffer's makes better mac and cheese. I had BBQ at Sunny Bryan's in Dallas years ago and brought home a gallon of sauce. It's not the top-rated cue in Dallas now, but better than this place still. Low and slow is the name of the game and they aren't winning it. Also could do without the country music. Fiddles without the lovesick moaning would be an improvement.",

    "text": "Go to this place.  I'm from central Texas where serious top notch BBQ is everywhere, and this place is the real deal.  While I always get brisket, Mom wanted chicken and Tri-tip.  Mmm.  The smoke is serious.  In Texas we have sauce but it's not always used.  Big B's not only has traditional BBQ sauce but also a tasty mustard sauce, which I used on the chicken.  The tables are just like a centex BBQ joint, meat served on butcher paper as is the tradition.  Also, the staff were amazingly friendly and nice.  They were attentive, offered a tasting of meat to help us decide, and then remembered us, bringing our order to our table, rather than call out an order number.  I just discovered this place a few weeks ago because I was nearby; we've decided to become regulars.",

White bread - 9/10 throw back memories of wonder bread Sauces - sweet red - 9/10 great sauce; green vinegary - Carolina style - 6/10. Wine - beer - great selection and surprised to see Educated Guess as a featured wine - really nice!

They have sweet and unsweetened tea, too. Easy parking. Lots of picnic tables inside that can accomodate big parties.  They offer pickles,  pickled onions and vinegar jalapeno on the side. The beans were a zesty and spicy heat thick pot of beans. I enjoyed the beans but my pal couldn't take the heat. I thought the side servings are larger than other bbq joints.

I must admit that I came to Big B's not expecting too much, many places just think that putting up a few decorations and saying they are genuine is enough.    I was VERY wrong assuming this was the case at Big Bs.  If you don't know, BBQ in Texas is a solemn and sacred thing!  I suspect the old \"Don't Mess With Texas\" ad campaign was really about BBQ.  Big Bs is clean, open and cheery with just enough of that wonderful smokey smell (not overwhelming) wafting through the restaurant. The decor and ambiance is as Texas as you can get.  This is not a sit down server restaurant (which would not be authentic if it was) You order from a counter type area staffed with knowledgeable and courteous folks.  I ordered my litmus test meal for my first visit - a brisket po'boy, with a side of creamed corn and potato salad (diet is not in my vocabulary).    It was a beautiful thing..  To say that I was impressed is an understatement.  I kid you not - I actually got misty eyed!  I was transported through my meal back to the Texas Hill Country.   I won't bore you with a detailed \"I think I'm a real food critic\" critique on everything.  This statement should be enough.. This is REAL Texas BBQ. All the tastes I know and love are here..I will be back again and again.",

    "text": "Delicious BBQ!   Came here at 2pm one Saturday afternoon. Wasn't crowded but busy.   Husband and I shared a 3 meat plate - got the beef ribs (upcharge $5), pulled pork, and the brisket. (As a rule, you must always order a brisket as one of your meats.)  When ordering, we were asked if we want more meat or fat with the brisket (the right answer is fat).   Ribs did not disappoint (worth the upcharge), but the brisket needed more fat (maybe I have to ask for *extra* fat next time). Pulled pork was delicious too. Got the fries and mac and cheese as our sides and we devoured the entire thing.   It seems all the meat was smoked/cooked in-house and the place is super clean.   I always check the bathroom (I think it reflects the cleaniness of the place) and that was clean too.   Would give that last star if they had a fixin's station/section/table - definitely worth the visit - we'll be back!",

I personally suggest the ribs (grade A), burnt ends, briskets and links.  It was well worth the drive across town and I will be back again.",

The brisket is so soft, melts in your mouth, pork ribs fall off the bone and smoked just right, the beef ribs are awesome!, pulled pork is just mouth watering good! The sides...oh Wow..creamed cornjust like i remember in Texas, pasta salad is a must, Fries...all of it.  Get all the sides...you cannot go wrong. Stay away from any LV strip BBQ joints or Famous D's..etc etc....just come here and you will know why i told you. They let you just enjoy the flavor and quality of the smoked meats..without covering it with sauce.....even good by itself.  I must say, the owners are doing it REALLY RIGHT!!...here in Las Vegas. This is by far the best BBQ in Vegas, outside Texas of course...where I here the owners are from. I will keep coming back here...I havent found a place that takes pride in delivering the best quality smoked BBq like these guys do!!!  Also try the sandwiches...i was too full to try those..but i bet they are BOMB!!  ALSO, the staff is friendly, fun and knowledgeable. They look great in plaid shirts!!  Keep it Up guys!!..Cant wait for the Westside location to Open Up!!",

    "text": "Shout out to Terri C for organizing not only AJ get together. To pick perfect spot for big group and some tasty BBQ.   I never been to Big B's Texas BBQ in Henderson. So I was looking forward to get my BBQ on. First impression was really like the set up and the interior design. It big open kitchen so the smells were addicting from the burning wood, all that meat , and seeing all the different cuts of beef cut to order. See the positive vibes and the whole kitchen staff all the same page. Love the open dining area and all the wooden benches. Roll paper for napkins at every table. It feels like at family outdoor BBQ just indoors.  I decided to go with two meat combination. Brisket and Tri Tip. Sides went with the Mac and Cheese/Cornbread. Both meats were hell of tasty. Both moist, perfect amount of fat (Brisket even ask if want fatter cut), and seasoning in point. Add the house BBQ sauce. Solid SOLID BBQ.   Mac and Cheese not super thick or cheesy stringy consistently. More creamy. Good. Cornbread was awesome.",

    "text": "Alright alright. You know how there are three kinds of BBQ. The one that you put on a gas grill (like most places)and pour on some bbq sauce, the other one is your buddy's backyard which you question if it's even thoroughly cooked.. Then there is THIS place that uses an actual smoker and slow cook that son of a bbq meat right in there.  Big Bs do not cut corners. They use mesquite wood haul from Texas and smoke for 8 to 12 hrs. All that flavor was beat into every single bite. If you are serious about your bbq then you seriously have to try this place.   If you think the sides wont live up to it ? WRONG !! The sides are amazing. If I had to recommend the 2 meat 2 sides combo plate, i would go for the brisket, Turkey, mac&cheese and slaws. Dont forget the sweet tea ...   Everything was really good. ( I actually tried everything, literally)   Services were amazing ! Friendly staffs and very clean dining area.",

    "text": "Now a part of Henderson's dining scene for 3.5 years, and Sin City's best place for smoked Meat just as long, it was alongside nine friends that dinner was enjoyed at Big B's Texas BBQ on Saturday, Brian Buechner and Natalia Badzjo's Food and hospitality continuing to set a high standard while former Marche Bacchus Chef Amanda Hamilton has also joined the team as they prepare for west-side expansion.  Still making new fans to this day, the hand-built interior of 3019 St. Rose Parkway attesting to the sort of work ethic that sees wood driven in from Texas any time supply begins to thin, it was just as the clock struck 6:30pm that an order was placed, Drinks from a Coke Remix Machine plus Beer filled and plenty of share plates plus rolls of paper towels gathered for a table that knew they'd need it.  Playing country tunes overhead and sports on television, the upcoming football season sure to see Big B's packed with Longhorns and Cowboys, it was on individual trays that Meats, Breads and Sides arrived quickly, the housemade Cornbread particularly soft when warm and delicious whether plain or slathered with Butter, but best when eaten bite for bite with Beans cooked low and slow in Sauce imbued with Brisket.  Not sleeping on Slaw, Potato slices cooked crispy in Peanut Oil, Fried Okra or lightly peppered Mac, but leaving Potato Salad to those who fancy Mustard, it was after letting others select their favorite cuts that Meat took center stage, Big B's Brisket following Texas protocol with little more than smoke and a bit of seasoning while Beef and Pork Ribs also went quickly with a slight pull of the teeth easily liberating supple Muscle from Bone.    Not a night for calorie counting, though lean Tri-Tip and Turkey make that option available without feeling cheated, it was after a generous portion of Pulled Pork that Dessert arrived, Pecan and Apple Pies excellent despite being made off-site while Chef Hamilton's new Carrot Cake stands up well to the standard set by Big B's crumbly and moist Bundt Cake brightened by Citrus.",

For first timers, there isn't much room to stand and look at the menu without being in peoples way.  After reviewing the menu, I got the 3 meat combo of turkey, tri tip, and brisket.  For the sides i had mac n cheese, potato salad, and creamed corn.    The Good: Best brisket in Las Vegas, hands down!!  So tender and juicy, melts in your mouth!!  The Okay: Tri tip and turkey were okay.  Turkey was a little drier than I'd have liked, but it wasn't too bad.  No real complaints about the tri tip, pretty happy they had it on their menu.  Potato salad was much better than the one I had at Bell's BBQ the week prior.  Creamed corn was ok, no complaints here.  The Bad; Mac n cheese was super bad.  Very dry, not creamy at all.  Looked like it was just sitting out forever, very old and stale.  Just not good at all.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal.  Turkey and tri tip are meats that you don't find at other BBQ joints in town.  It was good to see that they offered these meats.  Brisket stole the show.  My coworker from Texas told me that Big B's had the best brisket in town, he was right.",

The restaurant is very large and has ample seating, including huge picnic tables or a nice round table that I always sit at. They have good sweet tea, that is not overly sweet and tastes fresh.

I loved the tangy sweet barbecue sauce that I could add to my hearts desire! The baked beans had bits of meat mixed into it. I normally don't order baked beans (I leave that to hubby) but it is now my FAVE of all time! The meat was tender, well seasoned, and overall delicious!

Walking in, you get the sweet smell of bbq that we all love.    The ordering process had an east coast flavor, you order at a counter as you walk in, pay for your food and then sit and await the glorious food.   We had -   Pulled Pork 5 stars.   What we loved about this PP was that it had good smoke profile and was balanced perfectly, every dry bite was followed by a moist bite.   We didn't have to sauce the meat at all, it was my wife's favorite.  Check the pic.    Moist brisket 5 stars -- the smoke taste wasn't as prominent, but that isn't a negative at all, the meat just melted in your mouth-- brisket isn't the easiest meat to make and Big B's nailed it!!!!  Beef ribs 2-3 stars.   First off with the ribs, they were made perfect.  The beef was tender, but didn't fall of the bone - that is a sign or perfectly made ribs.   What was the showstopper was it had a 'charcoal/chemical' taste, almost like they were cooked to close to the grill, or they were cooked over fresh coals.  ( if that makes sense)    To me that was a timing issue, again the meat was perfect otherwise.     Here is why this place get 5 stars and why this place gets it----  The owner Brian stopped by and shared the background of the restaurant ( they import their cooking wood from TX) and when I told him about the ribs he immediately acknowledged it and brought us a healthy serving of Tri Tip-- the Tri Tip was 5 stars, plenty of smoke flavor and a yummy crust around each piece.     Brian and Big B's gets it when it comes to customer service and I will definitely stop by going forward when I make my yearly treks to Vegas!!!!!",

I ordered the 12 inch brisket sandwich with two sides.  The portions are generous and can feed two for what I got.  It comes with onions, pickles, and jalapenos on the sides.  The coleslaw was bland, but there were plenty of salt and pepper along with many sauces within reach on the table.  The fried okra was a win for me  as I like anything fried.    As mentioned when the portion are huge so is the price you pay.  I paid about $18 bucks, which I thought was a little pricey for lunch.",

This place definitely still stands out. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating! I have a hard time choosing between the tri-tip and the brisket as both are delicious. Usually end up getting both! The Mac and cheese is alao  consistently good. The meat is so tender that you really don't need to add sauce.... But I'm a sauce junkie and their original is so delicious I can't help myself. The spicy BBQ sauce is also incredible although a little harder to get.... They make it in house and sometimes they run out.  Highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys good food and/or great BBQ!",

    "text": "Overall decent BBQ spot in LV. Tri-tip was decent but was a bit on the dry side. Beef ribs tasted good but was hard to get off the bone. The brisket was cooked perfectly and was plenty juicy. Coleslaw was just right... not watered down and had plenty of flavor.   Service was very good. Staff was extremely friendly and checked on us several times. One lady came by several times with different sauces for us to try. Ask for the mustard based sauce and the spicy sauce!  Plenty of space in the parking lot. The restaurant is massive and there is plenty of seating space.   Maybe it was an off day, but I was hoping for a little bit more from the beef rib and tri-tip. I will try to come by a few more times to get a better baseline for the restaurant.",

When you walk in and smell the Smokey meat, you will feel like you are in heaven.   3 of us ordered the 2 meat plate with 2 sides and one person got the half slab ribs with corn on the cob and fries. The 2 meat plates were ribs, brisket with beans and corn on the cob. Next up was hot links, brisket, okra and coleslaw. Mine was smoked turkey, tri-tip with Mac and cheese and okra.   Everything was so delicious. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The people that got the corn on the cob thought it was over cooked. The okra was I think the best side in the menu. Haven't had that in so many years and it was just so great.   The only problem was the food coma we all had when we left. We all agreed that we should of just got a one meat plate. The portions are so generous. Can't wait to go back. Only suggestion is maybe have a veggie or salad as a side on the menu. That would make it perfect.",

My favorites: Mac and cheese and creamed corn.  I mostly get takeout. While the restaurant is large, I'm not a fan of the picnic bench seating. But I can see how it adds to the family friendly ambiance.  Take it from this UNLV professor:  Food taste: A Value: A+ (go with the sliders! You get a huge portion!) Ambiance: B Service: A (you order at counter and they bring it to your table)  Overall grade, A-",

    "text": "I really don't get what people are saying about this place.  It surely wasn't bad but there are plenty of other places around the valley in which you could get (in my opinion) way better BBQ.    The inside is decorated nicely and is reminiscent of an old train station.  It is very big and open and the majority of the tables are communal wooden picnic tables.  The place is not smoky but that is definitely the resounding smell.  You leave this place and your clothes will make your car and room smell like a campfire had just been put out.    My gf and I each got a meat combo, her 1 and me 3.  Each combo comes with the choice of two sides.  Although I thought the prices were high when I first walked in, the amount of food you get makes it worth it.  I dislike though how it is an extra $5 charge if you want ribs...Anyway, she got the ribs with corn on the cob and macaroni and cheese.  I got the coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, pulled pork, cheddar jalapeno hot link, and tri tip.    All of the meat fell apart with very little effort which means it was cooked perfectly.  That being said, there was nothing that I really enjoyed.  The taste just wasn't there.  Maybe it's a different kind of BBQ than I'm used to but I just wasn't a fan.  None of the meat seemed to have much flavor.  Perhaps they were just smoked and not seasoned?  They have sauces but they were all on the side which is fine but even those were lacking in flavor.  I will say though that if you like hot BBQ sauce, the one here will blow you away.  The macaroni was good but the coleslaw was way too vinegary.  Hopefully this is just a different type of BBQ than I'm used to and thus don't really care for it, if not, than maybe I just came on an off night.",

And maybe I'm spoiled cause i cook my own when in town. But my chicken leg quarter was dry and tasted as of it was left in the smoker a few hours too long, the skin was smoked almost black and there wasn't any flavor/seasoning or rub added. Just tasted like smokey dry chicken. My pulled pork was dry as well,tasted like it was pulled and again no dry rub, needed sauce to compliment it. My brisket, that was supposed to be Tri-tip wasnt juicy at all but still had some flavor left. I wont comment on the sides because the texas style meats were supposed to be the star of my meal. Overall for 21.00 I was a bit underwhelmed with my purchase. And if you want ribs as one of your meats on your combo plate it's a extra 5$. I wonder how many ribs I would have got for a $ extra?",

The owner or manager came over to see if we want to change the chicken to another type of meat if we were not comfortable if it being a little pink, but we said we were ok with it. That was very nice of him to offer. The meat was really tender, potato salad was out of these world, creamed corn was so good as well as the corn bread.",

And yes, they were so stale we didn't eat them.   As to your salads - maybe cover them so they stay fresh?  But don't worry - we won't be back to find out.",

Overall the sad truth is sauce is a must, which is a sign of mediocre bbq.  The regular sauce is fine but nothing stands out and the mustard sauce is fine, but personally not my thing.  Mac and cheese isn't bad but again, nothing special.  Fries are fine as is the corn bread, but the corn bread is more sweet corn muffin than the crumbly corn bread you'd expect.  Nothing is bad, but nothing is particularly good, and overall I feel I could have spent my caloric consumption on something better.",

Everyone was so friendly - customer service is definitely a priority here. The guy at the front of the line that took my order was helpful in walking me through their process and wasn't condescending, making good recommendations and suggesting popular items when I was undecided. We were asked by multiple employees passing by how our meal was and one extremely large but kind looking man - who I can only assume is \"Big B\" - was one of them. It's always nice when you know and feel that you're in a family-run place!  I really like the layout of the place, making you feel like you're at a family picnic or BBQ with wooden picnic tables and the classic roll-of-paper-towels-on-your-table move. :P  We came later, around 8 P.M. (they close at 9 P.M. on the weekdays) and were offered peach cobbler toward the end of our visit because they don't like to serve it past the day it was made. That was a nice surprise! Also makes me want to get it every. single. time.",

BBQ sauce was good too!  Cons (yes, there's never an honest review without one): Cream of corn was too salty (but the Owner owned up to it & quickly apologized without hesitation and asked me to choose another, plus offered her favorite) Mac and cheese was a bit on dry side but still tasty Fries were not that crispy Had some dry/tough ends on ribs which they should never serve to a customer No wetnaps   All in all, it's a BBQ joint Texas style so it's all about the quality of the meat right?! This place has that hands down. Hope they do well!",

We ordered the brisket and baby back ribs for the meats and creamed corn and beans for our sides. Smoke rings on point but the taste isn't. The meats were very bland. We had to drenched them with bbq sauce for us to eat it. The sides were pretty good.

The sides I chose were pasta salad and creamed corn.  Both came in generous size servings and complimented the meats well.    I liked the decor of the place with its picnic table seating and high ceilings, making it feel like you are on a ranch or barn somewhere.  The country music also helped set the mood.

Huge open kitchen where you can watch them carve your meats and dish out your sides, plus flat screens to keep you entertained.  I went for the food belly coma 3 meat combo with the fatty juicy delicious brisket, the surprisingly good beef tri-tip (think BBQ roast beef just sliced thicker), and the underwhelming baby back ribs that were under-seasoned and flat.  But they had 2 very good homemade BBQ sauces, a mustard and sweet BBQ that were very good.  Add excellent corn muffins with hint of cinnamon, and all 3 sides were spot on!  The creamy tangy cole slaw, the deep truffle like cheesy Mac and cheese, and the best BBQ beans that had hint of strong vinegar and meat that made me happily pucker.  Overall a solid 4 ate BBQ feast of the Gods.",

Staff was super friendly and made sure that we were taken care of both at the register and while eating. Even though it's a self-seating restaurant, they took the time to visit with us and to even explain the sauces they've got waiting for you on the table.

    "text": "Brisket is the best I ever had the first two times my wife brought it home. Now, the third time she brought home the same as the second time (one pound for me) it was obviously the lean or the point. She even asked at the counter because they show it to you. My wife asked \"Is that the moist? \" and the counter person said \"yes.\" Once home I looked at it and then looked at our son's who got the brisket meal; his was the moist as they say or what BBQ people call the flat. My wife is not one to argue or call into question and she did not look close enough to see the difference. Not sure why the counter person lied and said it was the moist (flat) when it obviously was not. I am thinking they either don't know or just don't care. If you order brisket or anything from this place, BEWARE and look. You will have to do the counter person's job and double, triple check that the person taking the order and the person cutting the meat is doing their job and grabbing the correct piece of meat in which to prepare your order. I have three smokers and love to BBQ. Their recipe for their brisket is incredible. However if you have staff that do not know the difference in moist which is the flat and lean which is the point or they don't care, well, you just won't make it. It is amazing how a place with million dollar recipes will go out of business. SAD!!!",

Today I got the #2 - 2 meat plate (13.99).It comes with two sides of your choice and bread. I got the tri tip and hot link for the meats and the potato salad and corn on the cob for the sides. They were out of the mac and cheese (sad) but I'll be back to try it amongst the other meats like the brisket, ribs, smoked salmon, salads...  The interior has 5. TVs and bench seating everywhere. Great big space and decor made for an enjoyable experience.   Thanks guys! I'll be back for more soon !",

And the \"PO Boy\"...clearly these filks have not been to New Orleans. They charged me an upcharge for a brisket PO Boy and gave me 3 slices of meat and a piece of bread...which cost MORE than a 1/2 pound of brisket. If you want your.PO actually dressed...thats extra...a lot extra. As for the brisket, the lean brisket was fairly tender and wasnt bad. The sauce is tomato based and had a weird finish but had some nice heat without being crazy hot like the baked beans.   I brought all.of this to their attenton. The staff was nice and friendly. But it felt like a rip-off. On a Sat night there was one couple eating, one that came while I was waiting and a man with his toddler son. In other words, almost empty on the one night everyone eats out...that should tell you something.  I might give them another try in a few months, but I feel so cheated by their rip-off and their flippant attitude about it.",

Had we known the portions we so large, we easily could have shared 1 combo. The Mac and cheese side was delicious and the bbq beans were spectacular! A little pricey for a BBQ place, but the portions are well worth it. Only issue is the silverware. At $18+ for entree, we should not have to use plastic silverware. It made some of the meat a little difficult to eat. Especially because their were no knives. Be prepared to smell like smoke for the rest of the day. Highly recommend this place for the food. A few tweaks and this place would be spot on.",

Their fried okra is good, their beans are good, and their creamed corn...........let me tell you about their creamed corn. It's JUST like Grandma used to make. It's rich, it's creamy, it's delicious.  Also, a few barbeque places I've been to around Vegas have been missing the mark with their hot links and sausages. This place has some great links!

My family is from Texas, so when  it comes to BBQ, I'd like to think I know what is good. We ordered a full-rack of baby back ribs, chicken, mac & cheese and the chocolate cake! The ribs were smoked to perfection! They had the best flavoring to them. What topped it all off was the in-house sauces that brought out the smokiness PERFECTLY. Another important thing to notate is the interior design. They have engineered the space perfectly. There is no confusion where the line begins and there is a ton of seating! Everything in the establishment has been curated perfectly for the aesthetic... I felt like I was in the Lone Star State. This is a place I want to bring my family to. It's completely family friendly and a great spot for a family outing, all ages! Another notable mention is the staff. The woman who took our order demonstrated excellent customer service and was able to explain their product very well. Natalia is also a total gem and noticed it was my birthday... Safe to say this is my favorite BBQ spot in Las Vegas. I can't wait to be back.",

The first thing I noticed when we parked was the amazing smoke aroma!! Most of the menu is smoked btw not BBQ, but that not a complaint. My son and I were very pleased and full. We even left with food left over.   He misunderstood while he was ordering and gave up a side for cornbread, which he didn't realize he did. When we got the food and we were confused our kind waitress said don't worry it must have not been explained correctly, which I agreed. So brought him out his side and he was super happy.   We were glad we tried it, will recommend. Will go again. The atmosphere in the dining area it picnic style which is great to bring people together. Glad to have a BBQ joint right around the corner.

Overall a huge disappointment. Other BBQ restaurants in Henderson are FAR better. Will never return to this one.",

Every time I had experienced barbecue in the past from other places, either privately owned or chain restaurants, I felt like everything was drenched in sauce. Personally I'm not a big fan of this, I' want to taste the meat! At Big B's, I was quickly schooled that real barbecue is all about the seasoning and slow cooking. None of the meats come with sauce on them, instead they are perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sauces are served on the side. They have an extra spicy sauce that is amazing, but you have to ask for it. It's not left on the table. The meat was seriously the best barbecue I have ever had! I was told that the wood used for cooking imported from Texas, so clearly these people take their barbecue very serious... And I'm glad they do because I get to reap the rewards!",

The     dryness and crumbly texture suggest it was either overcooked or heated too long. The coleslaw was mayo based, crispy and good. The BBQ beans were a disappointment. Tasted like beans in ketchup. I had the original BBQ sauce. Also, very \"ketchupey\". Very mild. They offer a spicy version and a mustard based sauce, but unfortunately, I didn't try them. The services was very friendly and prompt. The prices are reasonable..",

    "text": "Brisket the most tender I have ever tasted! So tender it was mushy. The meat itself desperately lacked seasoning especially salt. The meat was rather lean as well, suggesting it had been trimmed too much. The bark on the brisket had no crunch and even less flavor. However, on the positive this may be perfect food to serve to a new born baby.  Baby back ribs again lacked crunch or bark the bones fell out of them because they were way over cooked. The the meat tasted slight on the dry side however they were seasoned better than brisket.. I think they sat in Alto Shaam a bit too long.  The food came out insanely fast.   It would be much better if they had warmed them quickly in oven and blasted them with a salamander to firm the crust of ribs.  With anything if u slop enough bbq sauce on it, it will be good enough. I happened to think their sauce wasn't bad.  Wasn't great either.   Sides Coleslaw lacked vinegar and seasoning. Standard Coleslaw for the peons. Easy fix..  Potato Salad which I didn't order but came instead of my coleslaw which they let me keep needed much more fat. Was overall dry.. the potatoes should have been cooked more delicately in better seasoned water. I would guess the potatoes are thrown into  boiling water hence so dry. the bell peppers inside is a good move.  More fat and more acid would also help. Fried okra had too much batter which made it difficult to taste the vegetable underneath.  Last scary to see iodized salt on tables, really for 27.00 for a beer and 2 meat plate you serve me ionized salt.. very insulting  THE restaurant looks great and they definitely spent some cash making it look good. Whoever is marketing this place is killing it.. I hope you improve your food so less people are tricked by your great marketing..  While this place deserves 1 star I could tell they are trying. The pregnant cashier lady was very friendly. There is some potential.",

    "text": "We found Big B's on a Vegas foodie blog and inquired them out to cater an upcoming birthday dinner party.    It was important for us to select a local vendor.   We spoke to both owners - Brian and Natalia - multiple times prior to visiting their establishment.  They suggested for us to come in and try some samples.   We complied...and glad we did!    Upon arriving, we saw Brian roaming the floor and greeting customers.  Excellent sign for future business success getting feedback directly from his diners.  The restaurant smelled amazing and we knew we'd be in for a treat.    Amy, the shift manager, took care of us.  She asked about of party size, our tastes and food expectations. She began bringing out samples of the meats and sides for us to try, all the while making suggestions on throwing the best party possible.  Amy knew what she was talking about and you could tell she loved her job.  I got the same vibe from all of the people I encountered working at Big B's.  Brian set the tone.  His food knowledge expertise and ease with talking to customers was evident.    We got the party meal for 30-35 people.  We chose brisket, pulled pork and smoked turkey.  All smoked to perfection and juicy.   We wanted to make sliders, so we opted for slaw, potato salad, pasta salad and baked beans as our side dishes.  Also included was a tin of pickles, onions and jalapenos.  The making for a real down home, Texas BBQ party!  When it came time to pick up our order the next day, Amy checked and double checked our order for its accuracy.  All we had to do was load everything into the car and go!   Extremely efficient and stress-free experience!  Everything was placed in the serving tins with care for optimal visual pleasure.  It arrived \"presentable\" with minimal effort from me at set up.  Included were plates, silverware, serving utensils and a variety BBQ sauce.  An absolute turnkey experience.    Our guests raved at the BBQ choices!  We were extremely pleased with how above and beyond Big B's took care of us.  Many of our guests ate more than one plate and enjoyed their food.  Couldn't have asked for a better catering experience.   If you have a party, do not hesitate to have Big B's cater.  They will take exceptional care of your needs.",

Came here to celebrate a birthday and I was surprised how much space there is for seating. The staff is super nice and helped us with such a large party and made sure we were all taken care of.  As far as food, I tried the 1 meat plate (brisket \"moist\") you can request lean (has less fat) and this plate comes with 2 sides. I was very happy with bbq beans and mac n' cheese. Oh they also give you bread as well.  My yelp check in got me a free side so I ordered fried okra and it was good! Portions of the sides are decent and I'll definitely be back to try the smoked turkey and possibly their sausage links. Ask for their spicier bbq sauce which they give you on the side if you like heat.  Price wise it's about $10-12 for the 1 meat plate without a drink which isn't too bad considering the portions. I was able to take home leftovers.",

They were moist without sauce and cooked to perfection. The sides we tried were macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans. The mac and cheese was very good and creamy. The coleslaw was a mustardy-vinegar base, which was not quite like my southern coleslaw world, but the touch of vinegar took me to the Carolina BBQ spectrum that I live for. The baked beans, oh dear-total miss. The BBQ sauce they use is a tomato base that doesn't taste like traditional sauce. The baked means were almost like a midwestern bean chili. I really don't know much about Texas BBQ sauce per se, so it might be right. But it is NOT my flavor profiles that I enjoy. I completely skipped the red sauce and stuck with the vinegar honey mustard they put on the rable, which seemed to almost be comparable to Carolina Gold sauce.  Plus they have one of those soda machines where I can get Vanilla Coke. Yes, they sell COKE products, not the easiest to find in the area from the places I have visited so far. The little things excite me.",

The container that had the chicken and pulled pork had a layer of grease in the bottom.",

    "text": "Update! Visit#2 in 2 weeks....Lol   I tried the 3 meat combo so that I could get the brisket... Tri tip and of course the smoked turkey. :)   The brisket was very tender and juicy and it just pulled apart... And it had a great smoke ring... With just the right amount of smoke flavor to it. (4.5/5)  Smoked turkey... Still gotta say it's a 5/5... So freaking delicious! Will most definitely be getting this again...  Tri tip... This is where they surprised me.... It was so good!!! It was just like the brisket and had a great smoke ring and smoky flavor but the reason why this is a 5/5 and ranked higher in my books compared to the brisket was that the meat flavor came through and just really balanced the flavor to make it even better then the brisket. So freaking delicious!!!!  Gotta come back.... I've missed my Texas BBQ and this is the place to come and get some!!  ***************************************************  I gotta tell ya.... When you walk in...Omg the smell of the smoke just blows your mind or rather your nose...lol The smell brought me back to walking into bbq joints in Texas.... And the actual set up brought me firmly back to fun memories of sitting on picnic tables in the BBQ joints in my college days... Made me very nostalgic! :) And you have to love the paper towel holders in every section of the picnic tables. Ambiance (5/5)  Now does this place compare to pecan Lodge or Lockhart's in Dallas or the hole in the wall joints in Austin... Or county line... Or Rudy's.... Or Franklin's or the original salt lick in Austin....??  I gotta say no... Compared to them they are not that great.... BUT compared to any other BBQ joint here in Vegas... They are number 1 in my books. Now I know where I will go if I'm craving some Texas BBQ!! I'm just mad that I waited this long to try them! Lol  I had a bite of the bf's pulled pork and it had just the right amount of smoke and it was so juicy and flavorful! So yummy!! His fries and Mac and cheese were also delicious!!! So far so good! (5/5)  I got the 2 meat combo...I paid the $5 extra to get baby back ribs on the combo. Boy am I glad that I did!! The smoke ring and the bark on the ribs... So yummy! (4.5/5) it was a little dry towards the end of the slab.... But it was one of the best ribs I've had here in Vegas! The meat was tender and very flavorful and it was meaty!!! I've had some ribs that were just bone with teeny tiny bits of meat on there but the ribs here has some delicious chunks of meat with the perfect amount of fat running through it.  For my second meat, I got the smoked turkey and you might be asking yourself.... Really???? Smoked turkey in a BBQ joint? Wth??? But I gotta tell ya... I've had some amazing smoked turkey in Texas and when I saw it...I had to try it. And they did not disappoint! It was tender, Succulent and the lightly Smoky. It was so good! (5/5)  I can't forget the sides...I had the fried okra... Delish! Perfectly crunchy and fried to perfection so that there was no sliminess! (5/5) the creamed corn on the other hand was a little too sweet for my taste buds and not as creamy as I was expecting...I guess the creamed corn at Rudy's had ruined me...Lol (4/5)  Overall, Big B's Texas BBQ brought back nostalgic memories of eating delicious bbq in Texas which I was sorely missing here in Vegas....I can't wait to come back and try the brisket and the tri-tip.... My mouth is watering just thinking about the great meats I had here.",

I ordered some brisket, baked beans and potato salad.  The brisket had a wonderful smoke ring.  It pulled apart just as it should.  The problem I had was the brisket was: dry and flavorless.  I don't like using BBQ sauce because the flavor of the meat should stand on its own.  I ended up using their sauce-which was very tasty.  My wife had the same meal and felt her brisket was very good.  The baked beans were flavorful.  I prefer a thicker sauce but it was good nonetheless.  I would come back just not tops on my list.  P.S. please tell the very nice counter gal that I don't want to be called sugar, hun, darling or any of the other euphemisms she uses.  Doesn't sound good coming from a younger person to an older person.",

We got to spend some time with the owners Brian and Natalia, what a great job they have done building this restaurant.

Brought it home and opened the beer...fork tender brisket with a nice sauce, not too sweet.. The way I like it. I think tears dang near ran down hub and my eyes....we have FINALLY found a great BBQ place in Las Vegas!! Please GO!  Keep this place here forever and ever!  Forgot to take pictures, but other reviews you can see what you are getting! Thanks Texas BBQ...you now have customers for life!!!",

All the meats taste great. Big portions, no sauce covering it like other places. I'll go back to try the other meats.   Sides.... Cole Slaw and beans are yummy. I've had the Mac and Cheese too, but it wasn't hot (temp) enough for me. My GF had the corn on the cob (no complaints from her).  Ok, my 2 issues, and I know it's a Texas thing. I don't like the tray plate they use. I know, get over it. I'll \"suffer\" if I have to eat that yummyness. The other small thing, seating isn't too comfy. Once again, I'll live.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly, accommodating and helpful.   Keep up the good work!!!!",

Then I thought I'd come back another day because I was dying to eat their food, well then another bad experience. So here goes: I ordered my food got to the register and didn't know how my three meals plus drinks came to $60. Well this place has an up charges when you get ribs when you pick two meat deal (they didn't tell me this when I ordered, they may tell you this now after reading this review, oh but it was written on the board in small print) and they weren't even that good. So I asked the manager  don't remember her name, but probably the one who responded, \"why was the meals so expensive?\", she said \"well if we don't up charge for our ribs, then we  would be giving them away\". I was pissed not only to her comment but at the fact that they weren't that good, who says that to a customer? Well I decided that Id never go back there to eat. Back to famous dave's it is!!!",

    "text": "I hate to give bad reviews, but unfortunately this establishment needs an overhaul on management. I have never been treated this way, as a customer, in my life. I got a coupon in my local mailer for this place so decided to give them a try. Order taker was pleasant and explained the menu. Then told me I was in the wrong line to order takeout and directed me to the other window. OK. New line, new service person and the first question he asked was,\"Is this for here or to go?\" Hello!  Anyway I ordered #1 meat plate brisket, #5 Po Boy pulled pork, and pulled pork sandwich w/ fries.  I waited in a chair for them to prepare my meal. The service person said, \"I will put the bbq sauce in the bag for you\". OK, great. The order was ready within 5 minutes.  When I got home, I opened the bag to find no sauce and no pulled pork sandwich. Since it was the end of a long day, I didn't have the strength to return to the establishment, so I called and talked to an employee. He put the manager, Brian, on the phone and I began to explain the situation to him. He rudely interrupted me and said, \"Our employees do not place BBQ sauce in the bag. We can't afford to give away extra sauce\".  I explained that I was told they would put it in and I didn't get extra, in fact I got none at all\". He replied, \"I should have gotten my own. It was on the counter.\" \"OK, What about my pulled pork sandwich they didn't give me? Can they deliver it?\" Brian explained they don't have delivery service then said, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" \"Well, since you are asking, can you refund my debit transaction?\"  To this I got a lecture about how he can't afford to do that because of a mistake made by a $10 per hour employee. Well this took the cake, and I loudly replied, \"That is really not my problem.\" He finally said, \"Come by some time in the future and I'll give you a free sandwich.\"  I told him never mind, but he should seriously think about taking a course on business and customer service. So brisket was dry and tasteless, pulled pork dry, mac and cheese was good, beans were good, coleslaw bad and fries limp and soggy. I hope someone at least teaches Brian some manners or this place will not be here for long.",

Tables are clean and plenty of tv's for watching games.  I used to commute through Vegas from California and always made a stop here.  Brisket is great along with pulled pork and tri tip.  Meats have gone through the slow cooking process correctly to where you really don't need a knife to cut them.  I lived in Texas for several years and have yet to find a good bbq place like this in CA, NV, UT region. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area, well worth the visit especially since they have been consistent each time I go there.",

Everything was way too smokey, the chicken (dark meat only btw) was super dry, the brisket was tough as leather. I threw away a pound of brisket because it wasn't edible. The best meat was the pulled pork, which I enjoyed. BBQ sauce was solid. Overall super disappointing that a place claiming to be Texas BBQ can't get the basics right.",

Between this and the new Bell's bbq up the street, this is some of the worst bbq I have ever experienced. Are the LVite's so deprived & ignorant to what great barbecue it that they feel this is good? It seems to me that before people open a restaurant it would be something they are good/great at making, and comfortable maintaining the quality for large numbers of people. These places need better brining & curing processes for taste & moisture, smoke quality & control, and knowing when to stop cooking! This is not food that is cooked to order folks, the expertise, control and cooking is supposed to be done ahead of time and reheated gently for your dining pleasure, or not. Dry, overcooked and tasteless should not be part of the process, not when your taking our hard earned dollars.",

    "text": "We ate here on Saturday (only a few days into their opening) around 5:30pm. I have lived in Texas the majority of my life and I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. I have been watching and waiting for the opening day to come around every time I drive home from work on St. Rose. I have been disappointed by most BBQ places in Vegas and while some have come close to being good, none are ever great. This place was about the same. When we arrived there were only 3 people in front of us and it took forever to get everyone's food orders moving. The guy slicing the meats was slicing so slow that by the time I got to my table, my brisket was cold. I think having the meat out of the smoker/heat  and the amount of time it took to be cut (not to mention the meat coming in and out constantly) lead to that problem. Hopefully they get the hang of it (I know they are all new at this) and start moving faster so that this is not an issue. When it came time to get the sides, they were out of what seemed like everything. I could see them being out of things at 8pm but it was 5:30 and there was no cream corn, baked beans,  baked potatoes, and it was also announced that they were out of turkey while we were waiting on the sides. I personally didn't like the mac-n-cheese, it lacked flavor and the fries were a bit burnt tasting (it wasn't my first choice for a side, but everything else was gone). My brisket was a bit fattier then I like it, I wish it was trimmed a little more. I will give this place a try again in a few months, but for now I think I will give them time to figure things out.",

On the evening we stopped by, Sunday @ 6:00 pm, was told they didn't have anything but ribs and a few hot links.  Against my better judgement we decided to give the ribs a try anyway.   Ordered Cole slaw, out, cornbread, out, Mac and cheese and beans.   Almost went through the floor when the cashier said that'll be $48.21.   Had no beer, and can only be glad they had no slaw or cornbread as the bill would have been over $60.  We split a rack of ribs, $26.   The sides were $7 each for a pint.  Ribs had been rushed, dry and undercooked.  Limited sauce, no spicy BBQ sauce??   First and last trip there.  Way too many other, better, more reasonable options here in Vegas.",

We ordered the ribs and meant to order beef ribs specifically and may have not specified but the owner still made us up some and also came over to explain that he wasn't satisfied with the cut he got that week so he made us some extras!! Not usually a fan of pork ribs but theirs were so flavorful and falling off the bone that we would definitely order them again! Mac and cheese was awesome! The turkey was fantastic and my 6 year old daughter chowed down on it...They also gave her some free ice cream which of course made her day! We'll for sure be going back!

Nice welcome by staff and I guess Big B; well if it was Big B, he talks fast... but It does not matter it adds great character... we got a sample while reading the menu. Finally decided to have a 2 meat plate with pork ribs and beef link, two sides and a 1 meat plate with two sides, we decided for beef ribs... so my first disappointment was when I saw that the beef ribs have not been cooked the day of my visit :(:( they cut them up fully cooked, cold and stiff, then throw them on the grill :( The other order we have not been very satisfied either but at least the meat of the pork ribs fell right off the bone! Nice! But again it did not felt like it was cooked the day of our visit :( the sides, well... mac and cheese tasted not good... too mushy, maybe over cooked and under seasoned, the BBQ beans, good taste and flavor but too much sauce, French fries had awesome flavor if they would have been crispy threat would have been great .... best French fries ever! The coleslaw salad was absolutely the best of our meal.  If the beef rib meat would have fallen of the bone that would have been nice too, but it has been quiet a chewy cave women experience :/ the beef link tasted okay...  Unfortunately I might not go back due to my first experience :/  Overall a bit pricy for what we got.",

I ordered the pasta salad and French fries. When you tip the employees they ring a cow bell and everyone in the kitchen yells and cheers and say thank you! the tables are picnic style and they can seat a large party comfortably with enough elbow room to dig into your food. They also included large TVs all around the resturant which are streaming ESPN and Sports Center and exactly what I would love to watch while I chow down on my BBQ! There are sauces on the table to add to your meal if need be. I will definitely be a regular here!",

The set up is really nice and love the benches as tables, feels like you're in your own backyard. The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is cause my favorite thing to have at bbq places is cornbread. They have a choice for cornbread which is an extra $1.50 but just prepare to have a cinnamon muffin rather than corn bread. Overall tho the food is amazing, the meat is absolutely delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the mac and cheese I'll prob get another side next time.",

The tri-tip is good but it didn't have the red exterior depth that great BBQ has, especially with brisket. Ribs are good dry rub but not as moist as they could be. The sides are amazing. The potato salad is extremely good. The cream corn is fresh corn not frozen or canned. The side portions are large so plan on having extra. Maybe you need a humid climate for great BBQ. Maybe they cook it hotter than the slow cookers of the South. But, again, this is the best place I've found in Vegas. Try it.",

Brisket - tender & delicious  Ribs - dry  Okra - frozen, perhaps?  Definitely didn't taste like grandma's.  Fries - decent,  hard to make a bad fry Mac & Cheese -  too fancy for a kids taste buds, apparently.  I didn't taste it but my son who is a avid connoisseur of mac & cheese ate two bites and wasn't impressed.   Creamed corn - good, according to my husband  Potato salad - good, also according to my husband Corn Bread - weird, little nuggets.  I do like my corn bread to have whole corn in it, which it did, but it had a weird sweetness to it.  Some odd taste, cinnamon maybe?  My husband said it tasted like apple bread with corn in it.    My son liked the fancy coke machine.  The kind with the different flavored mix ins.  I loved the sweet tea.    Overall, I liked the atmosphere.  It had a lot of Texas stuff on the walls, which made this misplaced Texan happy to see.  The food was pricey for the taste.  However, the portions are generously sized.  I would stop by and get some brisket and sweet tea to go, then go home and make some sides myself.",

I'm not thrilled about the rest of the sides, but his beans and fries are so good, they get all 5 stars. The hot links are not foolin' around. They are SPICY, but fantastic!

I got extra beef rib bones today so that was awesome, Mac and cheese only thing bad tastes like casserole bbq beans were good. Overall I'm really glad I gave them a second chance, the food is really good today with great smoky flavor. Tri tip today has put tri tip on my bbq food radar, a lot better tasting than brisket",

    "text": "Big b's has a solid foundation to be a killer bbq spot, however they do need to refine in a few areas. They have an amazing indoor offset pit that you can see if you peer over rhe counter and lool towards the back, their selection is plentiful, and the meats are cooked to the proper doneness. That said, my first issue is the wood. Mesquite is an outstanding smoking wood but only after the bark has been removed. Bark on mesquite puts off heavy smoke with a slight shade of greenness. That is the carcinogens in the smoke that causes bitterness in the meat, and makes your mouth slightly numb and tingly when you eat. Not good eats. 2nd, the brisket was in my opinion lacking flavor, I am used to a thick seasoning rub that absorbs into the meat during cooking. The place has a fun atmosphere and will be bringing friends as I live only about a mile away. I will also be giving subtle suggestions to get that darn bark off that mesquite.",

    "text": "Man this is a tough one.  As a displaced Texan i had to try for some real Texas bbq in vegas.  This was just about average as far as what youd find back home.  I would defenately choose Big Bs over memphis or daves.  But being that dickies is closer I think ill just keep going there for my to-go orders but for a sit down meal I'd come here.  I stopped in and got the 2 meat plate.  As far as price goes it was on par with the other bbq joints in town.  Walking in I was reminded of home.  Signs posted on the wall says they serve shiner.  If I was a beer drinker im sure I'd be happy.  Everyone was drinking shiner when I was younger.  Ordering was straightforward.  I ordered my standard or brisket and sausage.  Sides were potatoe salad and mac and cheese.  Brisket was the way i like it Trimmed.  It had good smoke flavor and you could see a smoke ring.  It was a tad dry and didn't pass bend test.  Not the best brisket ever but far from the worst. Sauage i ordered was the jalapeno cheese hot link.  It was tasty and spicy but not so hot you didn't want to finish. I didn't really notice any cheddar in the sausage and it kind of reminded me or a store bought link. The patatoe salad was ok.  A little too much stuff in it for me but maybe you like it that way.  And a little too much pepper?  It is NOT a mustard based potatoe salad because its a Texas joint so don't be surprised. Mac and cheese... again a bit heavy on the pepper and a little runny for my liking. Now for the rest... a little odd that a Texas bbq joint missed this.  Where was my sliced onion and pickle????????????  also whats with asking if I want wheat bread???  White bread only :).  Other than that it is what it is.",

    "text": "Had an awesome dinner at Big B's last night, which was a little surprising for two reasons: we got there just before closing, and we're from Texas -- so we know good BBQ. Truly, I wish my family had more of an appetite because I wanted to go back up and order more of the meats they were so good!  The meal plates apparently are 1/4 lb servings times the number of meats you get, plus sides, or you can order meats a la carte by the 1/2 lb or 1/2 rack. We got 1/2 lb of tri-tip and 1/2 rack of ribs, both of which were expertly done and quite wonderful despite the hour. The ribs come out dry (meaning no sauce, not dried out) and while they have a bottle of sauce on the table it wasn't the rich style of southern sweet bbq sauce that I prefer, however the ribs were plenty flavorful without.  The mac n cheese was also quite amazing, and that's arguably harder to find than good meats! Really rich and thick like it should be -- real cheese is in there. Lots of bottled drinks and a Coke Freestyle machine too (100+ sodas).   Overall, Big B's Texas BBQ really is worthy of the name, and I'd bet someone in the business is a geographically challenged Texan ;-)",

    "text": "I wouldn't say that the local BBQ scene has come into its own just yet, but with the proliferation of businesses such as this one, it's definitely on the right track.  Big B's Texas BBQ has been open for little more than a month at this St. Rose Siena Hospital-bordering location, but they're already drawing big crowds. It wasn't even peak dinner yet on this Friday evening, but I witnessed the post-work rush build a long line and fill up at least half of the wooden benches in the \"cafeteria.\" They have plenty of staff in the back to handle the traffic, and some employees do filter into the dining area from time to time to deliver certain sides, take away completed trays, replace relatively empty BBQ sauce dispensers, etc.  The menu is straightforward, with a series of plates, sandwiches/salads, sides, and \"family style\" meats (aka a la carte) I was hungry, so I went for the 3 Meat Plate ($15.99) with ribs (+$4) and some other meats. The upcharge is still a good value when you consider the price of the baby back ribs a la carte, which is $5 more for a half slab than the other meats. The portion was at the very least on par with other BBQ purveyors.  I guess we'll start the dissection with the meats. I sampled my friend's chicken first. It was smoky and ridiculously tender but otherwise a little bland. It's not a meat of choice for any smoked BBQ, so I'm not weighing it in too strongly. My tri-tip was next. I can see why Michael K. and others love this. It's super tender, smoky, and not dry.  The brisket (sliced, which I made sure to double-check thanks to Stefany V.) had all the beef brisket flavor that you could want, including the smokiness, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was a little dry. Maybe it's the lack of fat compared to other takes on beef brisket that I've enjoyed? I can't say it's my favorite brisket yet.  As for the ribs, I can see why people are fans. They had the most \"fall-apart\" character that I've seen, they're smoked well, and they have all the pork flavor that I expect in baby back ribs. However, they're seasoned a little gently and left me wanting the spicy kick that I loved at another local BBQ joint. Paired with the BBQ sauces, they were definitely tasty, but they're not my favorite ribs within even a mile of this location. Maybe it's just personal preference, but a spice rub seems necessary to distinguish this pork from other choices such as pulled pork.  On that note, I did find the BBQ sauces very good. Well, at least the traditional BBQ sauce was. With mild spiciness, sweetness, and some vinegar, it paired fairly well with all of the aforementioned meats. But compared to my favorite local BBQ sauce, it isn't \"divine.\" I didn't get the peaks of flavor that I wanted, and I didn't want to sip it through a straw afterward. The other sauce, which I would describe as honey mustard vinegar, did not complement anything except for the ribs. I ended up mostly using both sauces simultaneously on the ribs, and only the traditional sauce with the other meats.  They're also doing great things with the sides, but the ones that I tasted were far from perfect. The coleslaw is just a little creamy and doesn't taste premade. The mac & cheese is really creamy and satisfying, and I'll probably order it for myself next time. The creamy corn had all of the corn flavor that I could want, and it didn't lack in creaminess, but it was a little bit on the sweet side. The BBQ beans could also be a meal in their own right with several meats already mixed in, but they're also on the sweet side. I can't imagine BBQ sauce, meats, and the sweet sides working harmoniously in the same mouthful, so there's a bit of \"anti-synergy\" going on, if you will.  Although Big B's Texas BBQ is working magic with meats and accompaniments, they didn't completely enchant my taste buds tonight. They do offer awesome sides and the best tri-tip around, but take that with a grain of salt because that cut of beef is not exactly a common offering among local BBQ restaurants. That all said, I do look forward to returning and giving them another opportunity when I'm in the area. Any carnivore should come here at least once.  (QUICK UPDATE 4/15/16: They should really put two people on taking orders. What a bottleneck. Anyway, tried a few different things this time. Jalapeno cheese hot link was spectacularly juicy and at the very least medium in spiciness. I should order it myself next time. Pulled pork was great when I revisited it as leftovers, with fatty tender pork that paired well with the traditional BBQ sauce. Beef rib was nowhere near fall-off-the-bone tender, but had good flavor and paired extremely well with that enigmatic yellow sauce. French fries were pretty good and properly seasoned.)",

    "text": "All the Texas transplants in Vegas held their collective breaths when they heard a Texas-style BBQ joint was opening in Henderson (of all places!). Well, I'm from the 210 and this place is fairly legit. I'd tweak a few things but the meats are solid, and that's the main thing that matters.   Got a two meat plate (with two sides) and a poboy- smoked turkey was generously served and moist, I'd definitely come back for that! Beef hot link was poppin', and BF said their BBQ sauce was some of the best he'd had since we left TX. Sides aren't to be missed either: the mac was saucy and distinctly smoky, and we fought over who got to finish the BBQ beans (and I usually don't like them at all!).   Had a few issues with the poboy (note the $1.50 fee for brisket or tri tip)- the brisket comes shredded? That ain't how they do it down in SA, and thankfully I saw it in time to ask for it to be remade with sliced (though I was originally met with resistance). The sliced is leaner than I'm used to, and not quite as juicy, but it was better than most Vegas versions. And where were the pickles and onions?!  Interior is done up with picnic tables and old-school bulb lights, with plenty of paper towels and sauce bottles on each table. Dining in might be the better option, as I got attitude and inconvenience when I asked for cups of sauce for my takeout order- apparently there were only a few ready and the cashier couldn't give out cups to pack my own, so I had to open up my takeout boxes at the tables and add sauce inside (getting it all over everything). Not thrilled.  Management (Brian?) was on point though- ribs looked incredible (will be coming back to try them!) but weren't falling-off-the-bone tender yet, so he held off serving them until they were ready, which I thought was good quality control. Line staff and cashiers seem to be in need of some training in the area of Southern hospitality though.",

    "text": "I love to see all of these new BBQ spots popping up in Henderson. It's also great that all of these places are local businesses! Vegas was seriously lacking in local business when I moved here and this area is definitely changing for the better in that regard.   Ever since living in Texas I have had a love of BBQ, especially Texas style. As soon as I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign I knew I'd be coming in to give this spot a try. Last night I finally made it in for a to go order after an appointment I had in the area.  This restaurant is huge! I loved the decor with the picnic tables and little touches that make it feel like a Texas BBQ spot. As soon as you walk in you head left and down the hall to the start of the counter. They are definitely prepared for crowds. By the time I walked up to the counter someone was already waiting to take my order. The menu options are on a large board over the counter as well as a smaller version in front of your face while ordering. I appreciated the up close version of the menu since I always forget to bring my glasses.   The staff was very friendly and giving full attention to their customers. I definitely felt like they care about their business and their customers. My to go order came up in a timely manner with attention to making sure I had my preferred sauce and utensils if I needed them.   Since I'm on a diet (womp, womp) I ordered a three meat plate (comes with two sides) plus an additional small side for my husband and I to split. I opted for the half a rack of baby back ribs as one of my meats for a $4 upcharge. This order was definitely enough for two people to share.  Meats: Cheddar Jalapeno Sausage Links- juicy, cheesy, and hot. I loved these. Brisket-moist with a satisfying smoky flavor Baby Back Ribs- moist with a great smoky flavor  Sides: Creamed Corn- my favorite of the sides, great flavor  Baked Beans- loved that there were bits of veggie in here and the sauce was tasty Potato Salad- loved that it had egg and veggie mixed in, I enjoyed this, but be aware that this isn't a mayo loaded creamy potato salad  Sauce: I was given the option for sweet or spicy and chose sweet more for my husband. The sweet was good, but not my favorite BBQ sauce ever. Next time I'll definitely try the spicy sauce.   My first visit left a good enough impression for me to return. This is definitely a solid option for the area.",

    "text": "This place is worthy of 5 stars.   We walked in and realized it's cafeteria-like ordering style.  We were promptly greeted and was told, all the ribs just sold out and they won't have it again until tonight.  Immediately turned me off, because that's my go-to choice of meat.    Contemplating whether to go with 1 or 2 meats, the lady told us it would about 4 ounce portions per meat.  I went with the brisket, tri-tip, corn on the cob and coleslaw for my two sides.  My husband got the tri-tip and the turkey breast.  The turkey is actually slow cooked for 7 hours and who knows what process the rib and meats go through, since they ran out based on popularity.    All the meats were neatly sliced, no fats trimmed, just in case you're into that sort of thing.  The meats were lightly seasoned, and perfect if you want to add your own sauce.  Amazingly, the meats were so tender, you can just use your fork.  We tried the two type of sauces, for the sake of trying it.  The verdict, the meat alone is the star without any other sauce.  Great tri-tip, awesome briskets, most surprisingly, is the tender turkey (cashier said it was her favorite).  Corn on the cob was wrapped up in foil and there's nothing cool about mushy kernels.  I unwrapped it, well seasoned and I cut away with my plastic knife.  Mmm, yummy was my reaction and it wasn't even mushy or soggy at all.  Thank goodness.  The slaw was again lightly seasoned, not too much of anything.  The plated meals also comes with wheat, white and I think rye bread.  Nothing special, just sliced bread that appear to be Orowheat of some brand.  The decor is your typical Texas BBQ joint.  Nicely done with wooden benches, round tables for big and small parties.    Finally, a BBQ joint that is good, not smothered in sauce, so you can taste the meat.  The cuts of meats were good and hardly any fat on them.  I'm no connoisseur on grading meat, but this was delicious BBQ.  This is a real gem in Henderson.    The icing on the cake was when a manager/owner asked us about our meal.  When you care that much to simply ask, you get honest feedback.  If there is happy hour prices, we might consider gathering co-workers after work.",

Personally, I'm all about the sides! The Mac and cheese and creamed corn were great! The corn bread was lacking some flavor which was a little disappointing because corn bread is a huge staple for BBQ food.  The brisket was okay but it was on the fatty side which isn't my favorite. While we were paying we were looking at their desserts and asked if they were homemade and one of the employees stated that they were bought at the store and that they wish they could bake. It feels wrong that they are buying store bought cake and reselling it. Why not hire a baker?Overall, I would only come back for the sides which is a little disappointing.",

    "text": "Short Review:  We have everything in Las Vegas when it comes to food. A couple of years ago, a ton of sushi restaurants were opening like it was going out style.  \"Hot and New\" donut places, poke bowl spots, burger joints, coffee shops, and BBQ restaurants can be found are all over Sin City.  We are definitely spoiled and the food competition here is fierce.  With all the different BBQ restaurants out here, it's very tough to determine who is best. But when it comes to a really good brisket and tri-tip, Big B's has to rank up there.   Not So Short Review:  Bookmark Checked!! What the heck took me so long to eat at Big B's?  I remember reading Michael K's review about their brisket and immediately bookmarked Big B's.  This was over a year ago.  I finally got the opportunity try Big B's a couple of days ago and came back again today.  I was disappointed and impressed at the same time. I was disappointed in myself for not coming here sooner and impressed with the food. Michael K. was right about the brisket.  Big B's brisket deserves all the praise that it gets.  You get the option of lean or moist brisket.  The lean brisket is good and I didn't find it to be dry like other Yelpers have stated. The brisket is so tender that I had to eat it with a spoon. Their moist brisket is perfection if you prefer a fattier piece of meat.  If you're one of those Yelpers that thought the brisket was too dry, then get the moist brisket next time.  Another highlight for me is their Tri Tip and Beef Link.  You really can't go wrong with any of these choices. I have tried most of their sides as well.  My favorite is their creamed corn and BBQ beans.  I'll take my brisket or tri-tip and dip it into the BBQ beans.  Oh my goodness, it's good.  The prices are fair.  You'll get more bang for your buck with their multiple meat combos.  The combos come with two sides and they definitely do not skimp on the meat.   The restaurant is named after the owner Brian.  He's the Big B.  The service is great and the employees keep this place clean. The restaurant is also very spacious with picnic style benches all over the place.  Big B's is big enough to serve a large party and still quiet enough to enjoy your meal.  It took me so long to try Big B's because it's located so far from home.  Good news, though.  According to the owner, Big Brian is looking for a spot near our hood. In my opinion, Big B's has some of best brisket and tri-tip in Las Vegas. That's just my opinion.  Peace!!  2017 Yelp Review #78",

    "text": "The BBQ scene in Henderson is getting even hotter!! Big B's Texas BBQ is now open! And this place does Texas style bbq BIG and proud!  --Menu-- Portions are BIG and Value is BIG  The Plates or Sandwiches combos - each comes with choice of two sides.  1 ($9.99) - 3 meat ($15.99) combo plates, the latter a pretty good deal!  Meats - Brisket, Baby Back, Tri Tip, Chicken, Smoked Turkey, Pulled Pork, Pork Loin, and Hot Links order Ala Carte 1/2 or full orders   Some side choices I saw: corn on cob, creamed corn, Mac & Cheese, baked beans, potato salad, slaw, and salad greens  --On My Tray-- 3 meat combo with brisket, pulled pork and spareribs. Great smoky flavor in the 'cues. . My favorite, was the meaty spareribs! Brisket was good, real lean, moist, but not as tender, just a tad tough for me. Pulled pork was more leaner as well.  Comes with 2 slices of plain, fresh, white bread too. Is that a Texas thing? So no cornbread or corn muffins? I noticed it's MIA on menu.   -amended so after bringing home leftovers,Mr. B noted I didnt get brisket ..but got trip tips instead..no wonder there was no fat...but trip tip slices I got were tough.   Cream corn is irresistible! Get it!. The bbq served had barely any sauce. Bottles are on the tables, so you can control what you want.  Brian said the two bbq sauces on the table are mustard based (small bottle) and ketchup based (larger bottle) both have more peppery note in it with the smaller bottle with more spice and heat.   --Ambiance-- - cafeteria style fast/casual When you order, check out the menu on the wall and tell the guys what you want, go down the line, pick your sides and pay cashier at end of the line.   Bring you lunch money!! AKA CASH!! for now since their register is not online as of this review/  BIG pluses -  Family friendly, plenty of BIG screen televisions, plenty of seating. Dining area make up is communal-style, the get to know your neighbor way. With BIG, long picnic benches throughout. Really nice spot.    - The \"B\" in Big B, must stand for \"backyard\" because this place is BIG, like a huge backyard.  - The \"B\" actually stands for Brian the owner. Just look for the tallest BIG guy there. Cant miss him. Really nice guy too.  --LOCATION-- Main access entry from St Rose Pkwy just off Eastern, Raising Cane's is your visual cue.  Pretty sure you can also access off Sienna Heights if you dont mind wading thru the parking lot where the medical offices are.  --Summary-- Still in soft opening mode, ( we were there 4th hour in)  so keep that in mind people. No paper menus were ready to go yet, hours not posted on door but was told daily hours are 11am - 10pm ...and like I mentioned above, bring cash for now.  Lovin the diversity of barbecue joints we have in our city. Each with something special to offer. In less than six months we've had a couple of bbq joints open up and there is still one more I'm stalking!  Happy to have Big B's Texas BBQ here! Time ya'll make Henderson your destination for barbeque! It's all good!!",

Nice and big inside, full menu board and menus.  Our group tried a variety of items , smoked turkey , chicken, brisket, baby back ribs , beef ribs, potato salad.  We even had a vegetarian in our group who had the Mac and cheese, fries and corn muffins.  Let's start off with my order the beef ribs and smoked turkey , potato salad and baked beans. The potato salad had a good flavor but was full of really big chunky potatoes which I had to pick out. The baked beans had good flavor but a little watered down like they were trying to  stretch them. The beef ribs were the WORST I've ever had. The other people in my group liked their smoked meats and did not care for the Mac and cheese at all.  I would only return for the smoked turkey and to try the brisket. Oh yeah and Paulo the cashier was the best !",

The rest of the meats were forgettable, but the brisket makes up for all of it. The beans are delicious. Along with the Mac and cheese. The tritip.. ehh. I've had better.  Take the safer route and order the brisket!  With the mustard sauce. Mmmmm... Oh!  The chicken was pretty good too. Try the spicy yelp sauce!  Great customer service. Comfortable seating. Looks much bigger inside than it does outside. They have that red Coca Cola machine that comes with every possible drink option. AND - They serve beer. What more could you ask for?",

    "text": "Meats: 3 meat plate and 2 meat plate, consisted of Beef ribs, Baby back ribs, brisket and hot links.  The beef ribs was not as juicy and flavorful as the baby back ribs so we will only get baby back ribs going forward.  The brisket was tender and both that and hot links were juicy and flavorful.    Sides: Both plates came with 2 sides so we got mac and cheese, fried okras, and potato salad.  We saved the mac and cheese for our toddler since she was asking for mac and cheese which led us to go with bbq for dinner.  However, the mac and cheese was kind of dry.  I ordered a corn bread and when we arrived to pick up our food, I checked in to yelp and with the check in I got a free side.  I believe they comped that corn bread and gave us another one.    Conclusion: This bbq spot is spacious, lots of seats, and walking out of there I could smell the smoke on my body.  We like it and will return to satisfy our bbq cravings.",

    "text": "I absolutely love walking inside Big B's Texas BBQ because of the smell of wood fire.  And not mesquite.  Brian personally brings the wood (oak, I think) in from his family's farm in Texas.  The smell takes me back to the five years I lived in Texas, and the wonderful Texas BBQ.  Country western music is playing and the decorations are full-on Texas.  It's just a good place to be.  The food is good; it's quick.  They offer Shiner Bock on draft.  IMHO, any BBQ restaurant that doesn't offer a bock has a big strike against it.  Nothing goes with BBQ better than a bock.  I almost never order pulled pork, but I had the pulled pork sandwich today.  It was good.  It was huge but the bread does squish down nicely so that you can actually get it into your mouth.    I've complained about their fried okra since Day One and today is was truly over-cooked.  But dip it in the sauce from the BBQ beans and it's all good.  Service with a smile while eating comfort food, listening to CW music and sipping a Shiner Bock.  Life doesn't get much better than this.",

The brisket, cream corn and cole slaw was my fav.   They are super friendly, super quick and very nice. I love this place and I cannot wait to go back.

I got the pulled pork po'boy with Mac n cheese and beans. Plus you get a free small side with check in (can't be part of your regular order) so I got the creamed corn.   Pulled pork - absolutely delicious and flavorful  Bun - not worth it, totally soggy. Just get the meat instead. BBQ sauce - only one choice on the table but luckily it was good, slightly sweet, not very thick Mac n cheese - great flavor but could have been warmer Beans - not my favorite (as my very polite niece would say) The beans were undercooked, weird sweet flavor and a ton of stuff in there, not all identified. Creamed corn - so good! If you like corn, you'll love it. If you don't like corn then don't order corn for pete's sake!  My husband said the rib meat was falling off the bone and very good. I tried the sausage and it was very dense, interesting texture and a little too spicy for me.   Overall, great BBQ and lots of seating, TV's everywhere. Next time I want to add on corn bread for $1.50.",

    "text": "From someone who's eaten a lot of Texas BBQ (and a lot of brisket from Austin and Lockhart), my expectations are probably a lot higher than most.  I ordered the two meat plate - brisket and baby back ribs. The portions were huge! Full on half rack and 1/2 lb. brisket.    The brisket was a major disappointment for me especially from a self proclaimed Texas BBQ joint. I ordered the fattier side and while it wasn't overly dry, it wasn't melt in your mouth tender with amazing flavor.  It tasted as if I missed its serving prime and had been sitting heated somewhere.  I was also hoping for some nice slices with some black on the edges but instead got a pile of pulled brisket.  The baby back ribs is where we shined. The meat fell off the bones and had a nice smoky flavor. There's not much in the rub but I found the ribs to pair nicely with all their sauces which I enjoyed a lot.  Sides were good. It's rare I rave about bbq sides. Mac cheese and potato salad are as you'd expect, the bbq beans were sweeter than I prefer but if you like them sweet you'll enjoy.  All in all, Big Bs hits the spot when you're craving BBQ. It's far from calling anything \"the best\" but an enjoyable joint when you want some smoked meats.",

You are first greeted in the parking lot by the unmistakable aroma of smoked meats, beckoning you into the humble strip mall location. But don't let the inconspicuous location and modest atmosphere deter you; when you're smoking meats at a first class level like they are, I couldn't care less what environment I'm shoveling saucy, smoked meats into my mouth- judge me all you want!   My personal favorite is the moist cut brisket. It almost melts in your mouth and is great all on its own or on a sandwich. I have also tried the pulled pork and tri tip, also both delicious. The tri tip is so tender and has a texture that makes me think of the most deluxe, steaky (great adjective!) beef jerky ever! Portions are substantial and the menu is very reasonably priced; a great way to mix up a boring lunch routine without breaking the bank.   They also have several side options; pick two with any plate or sandwich. My favorites have been their Mac and cheese as well as their fresh cut fries.",

The ribs were not sauced which is just the way I like them.  Ribs do not need to be drowned in sauce before they delivered.  The brisket was spot on and perfect.   It was moist but firm with a well defined smoke ring and seasoned well.  The wife ordered ribs and chicken which was equally good.   The sides were all tasty and hot.  The beans had plenty of brisket in them, the fried orca was plentiful and not soggy.   The Mac and Cheese was good stuff and it disappeared quickly.     The staff were friendly and efficient.  We met Big B ( Brian ) and he is a genuine guy with a real passion for barbecue.    We will return to this place with friends next time!",

    "text": "This place is another one of my go-to places for great food -- and in this case, it's BBQ! Las Vegas is typically not associated with barbecue. Usually with the BBQ joints I've gone to, the meat is either over cooked to the point that I feel like I've bitten into shoe leather or dust, or it's undercooked and tasteless.  Enter Big B's Texas BBQ, riding in on pigs and cows pulling a technicolor smoker, spreading joy, BBQ spice dust and the smell of delicious smoke everywhere. ( Not really, but with how amazing the BBQ is, I imagine that's how they roll into Vegas every day! LOL. )  Big B's is my personal favorite BBQ joint for a reason: great service, great style, and BBQ that melts in your mouth! The restaurant itself looks like a makeshift set-up you'd find outside, with wooden tables, logs for smoking everywhere, and wire spools for chairs and tables. It really sets the tone for the food.  And oh my god, is it good BBQ. The portions are GIANT -- come in hungry and wearing some loose pants, you'll need it! I always get their brisket and baby back ribs, because those are what I use to judge a BBQ restaurant. The brisket just melts in your mouth ( Meat! Melting in your mouth! ), and you can taste the smoke in each bite. The ribs fall off the bone without much effort -- so tender and moist! I've never had ribs anywhere else that do that.  The meat is really the star of the show here, but they also have amazing sides as well. Macaroni and cheese with plenty of cheese and crusty parts, which I like; a surprisingly light and flavorful pasta salad; and corn bread muffins so fluffy that I didn't even need butter for them! They have more sides, but these are my personal favorite of the bunch.  Move on over, other BBQ joints -- Big B's really showcases what truly amazing BBQ is all about. My only complaint is that I always have to take a nap afterwards because of all the delicious food! LOL. If ever you're in Henderson and want good BBQ, run -- don't walk -- to Big B's! You won't regret it.",

We just returned from a six week stay in Texas...and of course while we are in Texas we indulge in serious BBQ.....thinking that once we are back in Vegas we will yearn for such flavorful meats....well, yearn no more....we now have fantastic BBQ right here in our own backyard.    We tried four meats: brisket, tri tip, turkey and pulled pork....all were moist and Smokey...and four sides: potato salad, bbq beans, cream corn and mac n cheese.  The beans had a lot of bbq flavor, mac n cheese was absolutely made with real cheese, potato salad had more flavor than expected; not at all drowned in mayo (a good thing) and I really enjoyed the cream corn.   The dining area reminded me very much of a traditional Texas bbq place...yet it felt much better...very open, very clean and extremely tasteful.   The staff was very warm, attentive and they knew their meats.    An absolute must here in Vegas.",

We entered and were greeted right as we walked in. Got to try some samples. Those samples sold us on some of the sides. We ended up getting the tri-tip and brisket with cream corn, bbq beans and wheat bread (over the white). We also got an extra side of fried okra because I loveeeee okra and always have to get it. I also got a side of yelp sauce since I saw some one mention it in a tip and got the free pickles, jalapenos and onions.   Let me tell you that I'm always a skeptic about yelp reviews, so I usually just put tips down of what I like and what I don't like. I liked everything but the fact that the tri-tip was a tad bit too dry for me. Dipping it in the sauce definitely helped, but the yelp sauce was a creeper. We were speaking with the owner. She was super duper nice and was explaining what she could about the sauce. He husband makes it, so she wasn't 100% sure what went down.   So all-in-all, I really liked this place. The ambiance, the customer service provided and the flavors were all on point. I'm glad the meat wasn't drenched in sauce. It allows you to actually taste the meat and the mesquite wood used to smoke it. Coming back next time kuz the fried okra was so damn good.",

No sauce is used, either, you can add your own. As a dedicated Keto person, I appreciated that! The other people at my table really seemed to enjoy their pulled pork, chicken and sides of creamed corn, fries (looked tempting), and my 4 yr old grandson really liked his corn on the cob & especially his Mac & cheese! All in all $80+for 3 adults & a child for good quality bbq seemed fair when you allow that almost half the bill was my beef ribs ($36) & I took half of that home for later!",

    "text": "Big B's Texas BBQ has made good use of the old Jason's Deli location on St. Rose.  The smell of delicious pit barbeque hits you in the parking lot.  Once inside, their simple but kitschy picnic table, wood clad walls, and picket fence decor is somehow homey and airy at the same time.    You counter order, receive a number, pay, and grab your drink while you wait.  They have a Coke Freestyle machine, sweet and unsweetened tea, beer, and wine.  We ordered two 2-meat combos.  I got the Sliced Brisket and the Tri-tip with the mac n cheese and the BBQ beans.  Unlike some other unlucky reviewers, both my brisket and tri-tip were moist and full of flavor with a great crust and smoke ring.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the Tri-tip, but I'd call it close.  The beans were full of chunks of meat and are definitely the best  I have had in Vegas.  The mac and cheese was also quite delicious; creamy and definitely not bland like a lot of places.  The BF chose the Hot Link and Beef Ribs ($5 upcharge) with the slaw and beans.  The Hot Link was juicy and just a little spicy.  The Ribs didn't come out for about 10 minutes after the rest of the food and were a bit tough, but the flavor was good.  The slaw was crisp and fresh tasting, but a bit bland.  We will definitely be back to try the pulled pork, baby backs, cornbread, and other sides!",

After all the name has Texas in it so you'd of thought it would be Good! The tip off that it wouldn't be up to par w Texas was all the decor, typically if your restaurant is #1 in a strip center & #2 has cow skulls & other decor the quality probably isn't there. The staff was helpful & courteous in our ordering process explaining the menu and our options.  Let's start w the brisket, lets just say we couldn't even finish it & what we did eat we had to drown in sauce. The brisket lacked a smoke flavor yet the restaurant was pilled full of wood which is another tip its not very good. The Pork ribs had very little smoke flavor but were decent. The jalapeno cheese sausage i'd describe as being a little like jerky. The side of cream corn seemed to be missing the corn, looked like all it had was the pieces of husk's and no kernels. The corn bread had way to much cinnamon and tasted like a muffin you'd make around the holidays!   I'd encourage the owner to possibly visit Austin & Houston and check out some of the Texas Monthly TOP 50 joints to see what True Texas BBQ is like. With all that said i don't think it was terrible for Vegas, if you've heard of Dickies BBQ i'd say that is slightly below that. its just being from Texas i wouldn't eat there again.",

Located next to St. Rose Siena Hospital on St. Rose Parkway, it's quite a drive from our home on the west side, but completely worth it.  The brisket comes in moist and lean cuts, they know what burnt ends are, and they make the traditional Texas sides that rival those I grew up with.  The fried okra is perfect, with homemade ranch (of course), and the mac and cheese is hearty and super cheesy.  Did I mention Shiner on draft?  But of course! This is not our first time here, but today, we met the owner, and he gave us a sample of their smoked tri-tip.  This brisket only gal might just be a convert to this more tender, flavorful cut.  A half-pound of heaven on a plate is enough for two people, with a side or two apiece.  They offer $30 all you can eat during college and NFL football games too!",

Set up like a classic Texas BBQ spot with picnic tables, paper towels on the table, and a open kitchen concept this place instantly puts you at comfort. The staff here are insanely helpful and for Big B Texas BBQ virgins they really make you feel comfortable and ready for the tasty meats about to penetrate your tastebuds and your soul.   I went with the brisket plate with mac n' cheese and BBQ beans, my dinner buddy went with the Tri-Tip plate with the same sides, but added cornbread. Ya'll don't even get me started, but this was some of the best smoked meat I've had in a long time. Both the brisket and Tri-tip were criminally moist and flavorful, literally melt in your mouth amazing. I liked the tri-tip better than my brisket, but they both reigned supreme in flavorville. (Flavor Town is trademarked)  The mac n' cheese... amazing! I could eat an entire vat of this stuff and the BBQ Beans were sweet, salty, and the perfect side dish for all the meats I was enjoying. The BBQ sauces offered here are all house made and I really recommend the mustard based sauce, a mix of sweet/sour and not overly \"stard\" tasting. The ketchup based sauce is sweet and compliments the tri-tip and brisket perfectly. They do offer a Habanero/Ghost Pepper sauce that is out of this world good and is surprisingly not too hot, just a delightful flavor bomb. I might have taken some home with me for my eggs, pop-tarts and pretty much anything within an arm's reach.   Are you a BBQ seeker? Stop everything, your search had ended.",

We arrived around 7:30pm in the evening and it was less crowded. I enjoyed the Texas ambiance which really made me feel like I was at home. We ordered a rack of their ribs, brisket, and hot links. Granted we arrived later in the evening, the ribs were dry and I had to add a lot of their BBQ sauce too moisten it. However, their BBQ sauce was tasty. The BBQ beans were okay (tasted better when I added sauce), mac n cheese was just ok, fried okra was probably my favorite side I tried. The corn bread didn't taste homemade, more store bought. Maybe it's me, I'm used to baked hot Texas cornbread cut in huge squares. Oh yeah, the smoked brisket was good, considering it went well with their BBQ sauce. Surprisingly the hit was the hot links, which was nice and spicy.  I'll make another visit for lunch to try their other items for consistency and the hot links. They always have coupons in the mail. I used one for our dinner.",

Broken BBQ hopes and dreams -- check, unfortunately.  The good: Ambiance gets a solid A. No doubt about it. This restaurant has definitely put in werk-werk-werk-werk-werk and thoughtfully executed its backyard Texas picnic concept. You can't even tell it was an old Jason's Deli. Furthermore, there's ample space and seating -- I almost expected a square dance to happen in the middle of the dining area since it was so spacious. Do-si-do, here goes the bad:  Food is mediocre. I was waiting for the wow factor, but sadly, it never came. I got the #5 Po Boy with pulled pork, which comes with 2 sides. (I chose fried okra and mac+cheese, which I had to wait for. It's okay since I knew it would come out fresh.) My boyfriend got the #7 Sliders, which comes with 3, so you can choose 3 different meats. He chose the creamed corn and cornbread (which you have to pay an add'l $1.50 for). We didn't know why because the single cornbread was so tiny and dry. Actually, all the meats were pretty dry. Even when I added the sauce. The sides were the tastiest part of my meal -- Fried okra w/ ranch is good, creamed corn surprisingly good. So there's that. Sides are still contenders in the bbq battle.  I'd pick the chains at this point (Famous Dave's, Lucille's, etc) and that's not to say I haven't tried downright authentic Texan BBQ. I have! (Salt Lick and Stubb's FTW -- meaning \"for the win\" just to clarify, not Ft. Worth lol) I'm not a barbecue snob at all, but I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that roasted this place. We've had better.",

However, we were sadly disappointed.   Let's start with the good:  1. The employees were super friendly and gladly took the time to explain the menu.  2. The facility was clean and there were plenty of places to sit.  3. All of our side dishes were delicious. We ordered the potato salad, slaw, fries and fried okra. The potato salad was flavorful and the slaw had the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. The fries and okra are fried fresh with each order so they were super hot and crispy. It was the saving grace to our meal.  4. Beef links had a decent amount of heat and a good bite to the skin.  5. The ribs had a good smokey flavor.   Now the bad.  1. The ribs and brisket were dry. Like I mean dry! Right when we sat down to eat, we could already see it. You can see in my picture how dry the ribs are if you think I'm exaggerating. The fact that we had to submerge it in BBQ sauce just shows how dry it was. We came here to get good meat, but that didn't happen.   The highlight of a BBQ place should be the meat, not the sides. And that's exactly what happened here. We left still craving that BBQ experience. I guess we still have to keep searching for a decent spot.",

The young girl who took our order was super nice.  The guy who brought our food was nice too.  They even warmed my apple pie twice bc it took me so long to eat.  The sweet tea was great.  The picnic tables were finished well so no worries about splinters.  Loved the big TVs. Clean bathrooms. Good parking.",

    "text": "Being from Texas, I naturally wanted to try this out while I was in town.  The restaurant is decorated pretty cool. You definitely get a Texas feel while being here.  Heck, they even have Shiner Beer!  Now to the food.  Texas has some wonderful BBQ places like Blacks, SaltLick, Hard Eight, Goode Company and a ton others.  I would have to say this place was pretty average.  I have had worse, but have had better.   I ordered a two meat plate - ribs and sausage with potato salad and coleslaw.  The ribs were dry and the sausage was plain.  The coleslaw wasn't good at all.  The potato salad was ok.   The BBQ sauce was nothing to talk about.  I was hopping it had more flavor.    What I would recommend to this place is work on the BBQ sauce and more flavor to the meat.  The coleslaw needs to be totally revamped.  Also, a little overpriced.  I paid $24 for my meal and gave them a $3.50 tip.    I think that this place has a good atmosphere and the staff seemed to be friendly.  It was very clean as well.  I wish them nothing but success.",

I had the corn bread.  yeah not exactly sure if it's nutmeg or cinnamon in them, but they tasted more like pumpkin muffins. it wasn't bad, just different.  The mac and cheese that I got for the second side was ok  not as creamy as I like - but it might be that it had cooled down on the delivery.  I will definitely order from here again.",

    "text": "OMG - I wish I would've read the bad reviews first.  I cannot believe some of the responses from the business that I was reading.  Most, if not all, of the customers that wrote about their experience and the quality of the food are NOT in the wrong for doing so and shame on her for being so condescending.  These are the types of things customers want to know before they decide on coming in and spending their money with any business.  I was finally able to coax my hubby to try out this place after almost a month of passing by here on my way to and from meetings during the day. It was about 7pm and we were greeted by a friendly guy at the beginning of the assembly line, he was very helpful in explaining the menu and made suggestions as well. Ultimately we decided to go with a 3-meat plate (brisket, tri-tip and jalapeno link w/ creamed corn and fried okra) and an order of 1/2 slab of beef ribs - all to go.  Total came to a little over $40.  They let us know that the ribs were going to take about 15 minutes to grill and as they were mentioning that, we noticed one of the employees pull out a pack from somewhere - not sure if it was a fridge or freezer and slice the slab in half.  My jaw dropped at the sight of the beef ribs, which were not the beef ribs we were used to getting that have the nice big juicy piece of meat on top of the bone...I was appalled and at an $18 price point too, I couldn't believe this is what they were serving.  Since this was our first time, I tried to keep an open mind and was hoping the flavor and quality of the other meats would redeem the rest of the meal. Nope - brisket and tri-tip were both dry and flavorless - I tried forking the brisket and it kept crumbling into sad hard pieces of rock.  Hubby tried one of the beef ribs and was ready to toss the rest - the meat on the bones was scarce and I can tell he did not enjoy any of it.  He was so upset and I felt so bad. The jalapeno link and fried okra were the only two items out of our $40+ dinner that were decent - BUT THIS IS A BBQ JOINT!  And none of the other meats met the grade...not good!  Nonetheless, I was very disappointed - I hate being wrong with new places to try when it seems like the good reviews were so abundant.  Next time I need to skip the hype and go straight to the HONEST reviews.  Try at your own risk.  Customer Service - 4 Atmosphere - 3 Food Quality - 1 Price Point - 1",

No sauce and couldn't taste any rub, seasoning or flavor at all. The corn on the cob was so cooled off I couldn't even melt the butter on it. Hubby had brisket. For $14.00 he got 3 slices and they were super fatty. Would not go again. For what you pay you can get much better in town. I've eaten BBQ in Texas and this wasn't even close.

It was huge, thick pieces which were rare. Never have had rare brisket. It was good, but not great.   For my sides I had potato salad and baked beans  I did not care for the potato salad. I like almost all potato salads but not his one. It's a generous portion and had huge chunks of potatoes but just had too much stuff in it. Red onion, red pepper, something green and crunchy (?), I assume mustard and ?  Idk - just wasn't a fan. Few bites was all I could do.   Baked beans were okay. Good size portion, piping hot but were too \"tangy\" for my liking.   Staff was super nice.   Probably wouldn't eat here again unless I was with someone who wanted to.

The cashiers were so nice and kept checking in on us to see if everything was good. Which it was.  And since we had pre ordered we just waited until our whole party showed up and then we let them know when to bring the food out.  We will be back, we drove 35 minutes to get here so as long as the food and service says Amazing we will be loyal customers.",

Sandi had a 6 inch brisket hoagie and loved  it along with the potato salad and cold slaw.  I had a 2 meat plate pulled pork and beef ribs.  The smoked ribs were the best I've had in a long long time, maybe ever!Incredible taste with perfect fat content. So good I didn't want to add a very good bar b que Sauce.  The pulled pork was also delicious.  Looking around the smoked chicken and turkey looked just as good.  French fries looked incredible and fresh cut too.  The Mac and cheese looked creamy yummy good.  We look forward to a return visit so we can try these dishes & more.  One request. I love the Texas State flag on display. And all the Texas University flags but would love to see an OU flag added as well.  Since we pretty much own the others.Lol.    Don't miss this place!!!!",

It's a pretty big, clean place with lots of tables (note:  most of the tables are large picnic tables so if it's busy and you eat in you may be sitting with folks you don't know).  I had the three-meat combo.  That was too much food for me (and I can eat a lot).  Prices weren't bad since you get so much food for what you pay.  So if I have a hankering for Texas BBQ I'll head back to Big B's.",

Expect it will take you a little while to go through the line, but it is worth it.   I have been there twice.  Had their pulled pork and brisket. If possible it was even better the second time. Just walking in the place and smelling the amazing BBQ aromas is enough to make you salivate. I have to imagine the rest of the meats are as good as the two I have tried.   The bread they use for the sandwiches is really good. The sides I think are still a work in progress. They make the fries fresh when you order them and they are good. Corn on the cob is good, but the one I got wasn't particularly warm. The Mac and cheese looked great but the noodles were a little over cooked. The baked beans are great. As for the rest of the sides I can't comment, other than they look appetizing.  Staff is really friendly and nice. Dining area is clean and able to support larger groups. Hopefully they will work out the kinks in the sides, but until then the meat is more than worth the visit.",

    "text": "Been hitting up Las Vegas metro BBQ stands that have been on my to-do list, and Big B's was next in line as they are close by and not in the mood to cook that particular evening.  A really nice brisket. More smoke flavor to it vs. Road Kill Grill, which I had a few days earlier. But, the brisket at B's was a little bit drier. Nothing terrible.  Coleslaw was on point. Very good, nothing extra ordinary. Beans were the highlight. Maybe a little too sweet, but outstanding. Fries appear to be hand cut, but were on the limp side and a little bit greasy.  Food was delivered to the table is short order. Friendly staff.  Did not try any of the sauces as a good brisket does not need the sauce.  Downer: no bread slice(s).  Will be back to try other meats.",

The ribs lacked any meat and was burnt to the bone. All-in-all I would say save your money and stick to a safer choice like Lucilles!",
