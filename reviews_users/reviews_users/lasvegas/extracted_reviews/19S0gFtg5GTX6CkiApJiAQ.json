    "text": "I promised to stop by on my way from San Diego to Utah and I definitely wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was clean and well put together. It reminded me of a homey chipotle, but a whole lot more Mexican. The food is fresh. The view to the kitchen is good. I could see workers chopping up fresh vegetables and fruits for the drinks and salsa . The cashier offered us samples of the aguas frescas, of which they have a large selection. After sampling, my wife ordered a chicken burrito with everything and a mango agua fresca, I ordered a marinated pork salad with a strawberry agua fresca. Our food was delivered to our table within five minutes of sitting down. The food was so fresh tasting and the aguas frescas blew my mind. Every bite was better than the last! The burrito was long and plump unlike the short stubby chipotle ones. My wife loved it and the red and green salsas they offer at every table. My salad appeared like something from Cafe Rio or Costa Vida, but not nearly as wilted or manufactured tasting. It was fresh! It came with what looked like an entire avocado chopped on the top, romaine lettuce, beans, the pork, rice and a green ranch sauce. So amazing! Although, I'm not a Vegas native, I can say that Frijoles is one of the best sin city has to offer.",

I didn't have time to try a specialty fruit drink but the staff was friendly and patient as they let a lady sample all of them...SMH. This place has charm, they're slogan suggests they have a sense of humor (How you bean?), and they close on Sunday keeping the Sabbath day holy! Great place, I can't wait to go back with my wife and kids! Nice job Arturo Trejo!",

    "text": "After reading reviews on frijoles, I was prepared to be let down, but I was not. The food was delicious and unique for a Mexican grill. I ordered for my family of six two plates of nachos, three full size tacos, a tostada, a dinner size salad, and some street corn. I chose a variety of meats offered including pollo, carnitas, carne asada and lengua. Everything was delicious, but to me the carnitas and the carne asada stood out as being the best. My kids are young but they ate and ate until they were stuffed full. Often it is a challenge to get them to eat, but they loved the food here as did the grownups. I really liked how they were liberal with the guac, cheeses, and pico de gallo. All of it was fresh and awesome. I really should have only had two tacos, but I ate three and sampled everything else I had ordered, but the food being great it was totally worth it being stuffed to the point of discomfort. I had to go on a long and vigorous walk afterward just to not feel like it was a post thanksgiving food coma coming on. The 16 oz. bottle of Mexican coke helped to fuel my journey. The staff let our kids sample the juices, and they raved how good it was. Well done, frijoles!   Two minor improvements could be made. Ok, first it would have been great to have all of our food come out at once, but they did serve it to us literally hot off the grill, so maybe just do the whole order all at once instead of jumping from order to order. Second, it was bit pricey to make it a replacement for a weeknight dinner on a regular basis. We may have over-ordered, bit it was still about $20 more than dinner at Cafe Rio. That being said, it was delicious and I left really happy :-)",

However, they still left some of the red booths which are not the comfiest things. Either way, I could not stop comparing this place with Cafe Rio. I felt like they were trying to copy some of their dishes. For example the salad was delivered the same way as Cafe Rio. The food was good and perhaps a bit more typical. But I felt like the ingredients were lower in quality. For their \"Carne Asada/Steak\" they use flank steak which is one of the cheapest options. The dressing was good but you can tell they have watered it down. So for two dollars more you can get a huge salad at their competitors with a much higher quality. Overall, the food was good, and if i'm around I would like to come back and try their el pastor meat.",

    "text": "This place is just ok...  I really wanted to love this place, being Mexican, it's hard to find good food here that's up to par with my own. The employees really stand out, they're sooo nice and accommodating. I've tried a lot of items on their menu, but all with carne asada so I can give my input on that at least.  Carne asada fries - crinkle fries topped with guac, sour cream, cheese, pico, and your choice of meat. What I would def do is not use crinkle fries! They are seriously the worst fry to use. Please use a normal French fry instead! Also, the sour cream they use is like a regular sour cream from what I tasted, instead I would opt for crema Mexicana, it'll definitely improve this dish x100! They are also kinda stingy with the carne asada, I'm paying 6.50$ for this plate, give me some more meat please! The guac here is fresh, but just doesn't hit the spot. There is not enough cilantro, jalapeno, or even garlic salt. It's super bland! The best carne asada fries are going to be from El Gordo.  5$ for half an order, but they come with double the fries, and do not skimp on the meat!  Plain cheese quesadilla - It's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla. LOL. Mini tacos - For 2$ you get a corn tortilla with your choice of meat. Again we did CA, and during our second visit the meat in our nachos and tacos were luke warm so it kinda ruined the meal. I know 2$ doesn't seem much, but I think for the amount of meat given they should maybe lower it to 1.50 like all the other places who sell street tacos and have piping hot meat off the grill. Also, you have to ask for limes. CA Nachos - I got these sans beans and pico. IDK why but I've never had nachos with beans. Again the meat was scarce and warm, guac was bland, but the chips were good. 6.50 for this plate also.  Elote - 2$ for this deliciousity. I'm assuming it comes with butter, cheese, and powdered chile. I wanted to love this corn, but it was just ok. It needed something else. IDK if they do not use mayo, but it didn't taste like it. I also got a piece that was a little too charred and was a little cold.  The decor is super cute, alas some of the tables are awkward because they are from the old Pizza Hut. They're super large so if you are sitting across from each other it's a reach. I would replace those babies.   This place has a ton of potential, we have gone 2wice, but I honestly make better food at my own home for a fraction of the cost.   Like I said, they have awesome lovely employees, it's just some of the food was super bland. Yay!",

Taco came bursting with juicy steak, heaps of delicious guacamole, sour cream, and other vegetables. Rice and beans were also well done, not a poorly cooked grain of rice or bean in the whole meal.  It's a very casual spot - you order your food at a counter, they hand you a little tent with a number on it, and bring the food to your table after a dozen or so minutes.  Be warned: for us, portions were definitely smaller than expected at the price, and a meal will leave you hungry (unless you order something very hearty like their burrito or nacho-esque fries).",

I would like to start off by saying this place is super clean! There is enough room for large or small groups. Customer service is great and there are so many delicious options.   We decided to try their chicken quesadilla and chicken platter. Couldnt believe how fast we got our order.  Chicken was juicy and flavorful. The quesadilla was delicious!!",

As I ordered I asked the lady whom I was ordering with if their horchata was made here but she said no and mentioned that the Pina, Fresa, Sandia, agua de espinaca(can't remember the other flavors) was made here so I went with the pina (pineapple) it was delicious! I also ordered the chicken nachos and I'll be honest, I wasn't impressed. My partner ordered an asada quesadilla and a taco(also asada) both were decent, but nothing we'd die to come back for.",

At $4.50 per taco (almost twice as much per taco as other places), I'd expect the food to be phenomenal, but I was left disappointed. Elote was about the best thing here.   We tried to use the free drink check-in offer. Pulled up Yelp's redeem window and showed it to the lady. She tapped something on there and said \"somethings wrong\". This happened twice until Yelp wouldn't let me redeem the offer anymore. I don't know what she pressed on, but regardless if something was wrong, she could've offered us the deal just for checking in. Instead she offered to give us a cup of water for, in her words, \"only one dollar\", which we purchased. That water never even came.   First and last time I'm going here. I could have better food and service for much less elsewhere.",

    "text": "So based on the Yelp reviews I came in to try it out for myself. I walked into this spotless restaurant and I ordered my guilty pleasure and once a month craving of nachos, except this time I ordered them with Al Pastor. Can I tell you? These were divine. The meat was smoky, sweet, and tender. The generous amount of guacamole was made with some jalapeno in it and gave the nachos that awesome spiciness I was craving. Oh, and the guacamole? Real stuff, not that neon green stuff you get at other places. The beans tasted like homemade pinto beans, not the refried stuff that usually comes with nachos. Everything on these nachos worked together perfectly. The bottom of the nachos did get a little soft towards the end but that's why you get yourself a fork and call it a day.   What made this visit amazing (other than the delicious food) was the awesome customer service they're dishing out. I was greeted by a very friendly young lady who proceeded to ask me if I was a first-timer and if I worked nearby (yes, we spoke in Spanish so I had no language barrier issues, deal), she then proceeded to offer me samples of all their aguas frescas (literally, \"fresh waters\"), yes, all of them. One by one I tried them all and, surprisingly settled on the spinach (try it before you judge me!!). Not only is the food a welcome change in this neighborhood, but the friendly service makes this one of the very few places that still know how to talk to a paying customer.   I will definitely be returning, and taking as many people as I can with me (I'm Mexican, we travel in packs). This food and service deserves to be shared and I promise to do my part. Always in support of a small business!! Anda Frijoles (oh, by the way, that means \"beans\")!!",

    "text": "I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks.   Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like.   Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to \"Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.  Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.  Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.  Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes!   I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!",

    "text": "Located on Charleston, just west of Rainbow, Frijoles is a new, almost fast-casual style Mexican restaurant. As others have mentioned, it's inside an old Pizza Hut so it's a pretty good sized location. There's plenty of seating inside and although a few empty tables were dirty, they seem to keep it fairly clean. For whatever reason, they lack a salsa bar and keep the drink fountain behind the counter. I don't understand why as they have a counter type section just to the right of the front counter that would be perfect for a salsa bar, drink station or possibly even both.  On the menu they offer up most of the usual stuff like burritos, tacos and tostadas, but they also have nachos, fries, street corn and even a whole line of fresh fruit drinks. The way the tacos are done is a little different though. If you want a standard street style taco, you'll want to order what they call the \"Mini Taco\". What they advertise as just a \"Taco\" is basically a fully loaded taco with your choice of meat. All the pricing is very fair and for 5 of us, the bill was just over $40.  I ended up ordering 3 different tacos to try, one each of the shrimp, al pastor and carne asada. The tacos are loaded pretty good with toppings and they aren't skimpy with the meat which is always a huge plus. Tortillas were decent and I like that they give them like just a light touch on the grill. Out of the 3, my favorite was the shrimp. Each shrimp was plump and cooked very well. However, the al pastor was a little lacking in flavor and although the carne asada tasted good, it was super dry. They do have a couple sauces at the table that helped and while pretty tasty, they were way too spicy for my 5 year old. We also got a couples orders of chips and quac. Their quac was thick and fresh but the chips come in a pretty small order and were super salty.   The service was ok but they definitely have some kinks to work out. I noticed a few others mention the same thing but our food came out in such weird intervals. Our food came out first, then chips, then the quac for the chips and then when we were almost done eating, the corn came. Just strange. It also seemed like the owner was working harder than anyone else. While I think it's necessary for an owner to work in their business and I appreciate it, I don't see why he's sweating and running around while employees are standing behind the counter doing nothing.   All-in-all, this is a solid little joint and I think with time and minor changes, they will do really well. Nothing stood out as outstanding but it was decent and I would come back when in the area.",

Let's start with customer service, everyone one there is so nice they let you sample the juices even suggest juices to mix. It feels good to walk in and be recognized and they already know what you are going to order. The food is fresh, cooked to order, perfect amount of seasoning and ingredients. It was so good my boyfriend and I went 4 times in a row with 2 times being in the same day ( I pride myself on knowing good food) my favorite items on the menu would have to be the carne asada quesadilla, and the shrimp salad. My first time eating a salad and not noticing that I didn't put any dressing on it ( just delicious) but the dressing they have is delicious as well. The spinach drink is my fav and sometime I mix spinach with pineapple for more sweetness. And don't worry if you show to the restaurant 10 minutes before closing you still will receive excellent customer services and fresh food unlike other places where you feel like you are an inconvenience and you get the scrappy food.... I cannot rave about this place enough !!!!",

We also ordered the al pastor taco and the meat was on point with the flavors of al pastor. Carnitas is my fave so we had to order some, and they are the best carnitas I've had on this side of town, I was so happy they were awesome! They also have green and red salsa on every table not super spicy but very good and authentic. The street corn was good too. My only complaint is that I thought it was bit pricy for Mexican food, but everything we ordered was super good and worth the price. Oh I can't forget to mention, they have Aguas frescas I tried them all and they were all so refreshing and delish! Try the spinach agua fresca it was so good. Will be back!",

The beans were amazing not the traditional pinto beans that you find every where they use Peruvian beans. We also got elote.  Super sweet and seasoned perfectly.  Very impressed, we will definitely be back. Keep in mind that they are closed on Sundays.",

(Its just corn prepared) I tasted better on a roadside in TJ and the staff really makes the place clean even during a busy lunch etc...I came twice just to make sure I didnt catch a bad day.  Nope! Negatives: Its a one trick pony! Staff is not what you call \"Hello!' Welcome! Why not? I cant stand the lady taking my order, there is so much to order. I mean what if I decided to try Lengua. If I try tongue, I just dont eat that anywhere. How is it prepared?! She is pushy and impatient...really? Street venders in TJ are more polite! The AGUAS FRESCAS are covered in Sugar probably to hide the quality of the \"fresh fruit\". Now the Taco: You dont need to but in every single ingredient in there, the meat and tortilla should do all the talking. This place has potential to be great, however looks like it is owned by an American with a passion for Mexican Cuisine and hired Mexican staff with no passion at all. If I'm going to spend 10 on burrito combo I expect at the VERY LEAST to be that experience.",

When I told them there was none they looked at me crazy as if I was to blame, took the tacos added the toppings. Cool. Sit back down there's a BLACK HAIR, in the cilantro on my taco!!! I also realized they never gave me my drink. Mistakes happen, just my luck. The number one reason I'm giving this place 1 star, is because when a different lady (I'm assuming the manager) came to the register because I requested cash back for just my tacos, rudely said \"what's the problem because we didn't see anything\"!!! And told me \"oh well your drink was free\"...I had yet to take a bite of any of my food mind you. I was trying to be understanding but to be called a LIAR, on top of the list of mistakes they made.

I don't know if I came here on their off day or they went downhill but I was disappointed by my visit today.  SERVICE Meh. Its one of those people that hates their job so they turn into a robot and don't give two shits about customers. Waited 15 min at the table for our order and lady threw the bag on the table and walked off. No thanks.  FOOD On my previous visit, I ordered the mini Carne Asada taco and really liked it. I believe their mini tacos comes with cilantro, meat of choice and onions. They are only  $1.99 so it would be great for people who like to experiment with different add-ons and choice of meat. Carne Asada was so juicy few months ago. Now, its just a dry piece of meat. Asked for extra avocado but I barely got any which is somewhat irritating.  Fish taco was another one of my favorite from last visit. It used to have so much flavor. Now, lacks flavor and shredded fish that falls apart as crumbs everywhere. No thanks.  CONCLUSION Please step up your game. You guys used to have some delicious tacos..I want them back!",

    "text": "NO WAY this place is worthy of a 4.5 star average. This is an overpriced Taco Bell. Tastes like it too.  We got a cabeza burrito and al pastor burrito. I love real Mexican food so whenever I see lengua and/or cabeza on the menu I get excited. The cabeza had no flavor whatsoever. Super bland. The al pastor wasn't that tender and also under seasoned.  The big problem for me was too many frijoles! In hindsight, ok this place is called Frijoles, and I like beans; I don't want a burrito with 75% beans! And shocker, bland!  The salsas were thin and watery and not hot enough. The only redeeming factor was the tortillas. I liked the chewy texture.  I should also mention it took 15 mins for us to get two burritos when there was only one other party (of 2) in the whole place.  Here's the kicker. When I went to throw away my trash, I saw a dead cockroach on the ground. Whoever cleaned up that night knows this is True.  Roaches freak the crap out of me and are the only bug I'm scared of, and even dead they gross me out. The only reason why seeing a roach at a restaurant didn't get a one star is we didn't get sick.  Whenever there is a roach in the front of the house, you know there is a bigger problem in the back.",

    "text": "Ok let's start by saying I love Mexican food.  I think it would be safe to call me a connoisseur of Mexican food!    Cesar Q. and I were starving so thanks to some great yelp reviews and pictures we decided to stop by this place.    This place is unique.  You stand in line to place your order and then go take your seat.  Someone brings your food out to you.  So I guess this is considered \"fast casual\".    I ordered the carnitas/pork nachos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  Prices were reasonable but portions were a bit small in comparison to what we had expected.  My nachos filled me up but I wasn't about to split.  The hubs felt the quesadilla was way to small for the price paid.  We ended up ordering the shrimp cocktail to make up for what we had already ordered.    I would recommend the shrimp cocktail as it is great!  The rest of the food was just so/so.    What really annoys me is that while placing our order  while standing in line and paying there is a tip option on the receipt.  It's like going to Mc Donald's and tipping. You just don't do it.  Now that it's on my receipt I feel obligated to tip.  So of course I tip.  My food is brought out and no drinks on the tray.  I ask for water and the girl points to the ice water on the counter and tells me to do it myself.  I would like my tip back thank you very much. What's the point of tipping if your not serving? Ok enough with that.    The food did not leave me thinking \"I need to come back\" like some places do....",

    "text": "Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos is nothing to get excited about. Yes, the beans are pretty good and my family got a kick out the staff's \"How you bean?\" t-shirts, but I was pretty underwhelmed with what Frijoles and Frescas had to offer.  VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($6.49): When I get a burrito at a legit Mexican joint, I'm expecting a humungous burrito with the tortilla struggling to keep the contents inside. Not so at Frijoles and Frescas. I could have ate two of those suckers. Taste wise, it was a-ok. 3/5  TACO ($4.49): Pretty expensive for one taco. My mom said the taco was good but that it's not worth paying $4 for. 3/5  CHIPS & SALSA ($2.00): Paying for chips and salsa is one of my pet peeves. It should be free, dammit!! My dad said he liked Chevy's chips better and I thought the salsa was unexpectedly sweet. I prefer spicy salsa, personally. 2/5  FRIES ($6.99): My husband really liked his loaded nacho fries! 4/5  HORCHATA ($2.50): With a dead serious face: The absolute WORST horchata I've ever had the displeasure of trying. I took one sip and was disgusted. It tasted like I was drinking sand. I must have gotten the absolute bottom of the barrel or something. They brought another horchata out but I didn't want any part of it. I was kind of irked they didn't apologize or offer to refund me. 1/5  VIBE: I did like the set up of Frijoles and Frescas and the customer service was great (as far as greeting customers and saying goodbye). I'd call it an upscale taco shop. It took about 15 - 20 minutes to get our food, and they brought the chips out after the food, so there was some disorganization. A steady stream of customers kept rolling in through the door.  3/5    Worth a Return Visit? At least I got to cross Frijoles and Frescas off my list of bookmarks. I won't be coming back, however. The taqueria down the street from my house is way better!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #90",

    "text": "So I was craving tacos again, shocker! I pulled out my trusty yelp and found this joint.   As I walked in there was a long line and the stereotypical belligerent lady yelling at the cashier over her order. There was definitely a language barrier because the cashier didn't speak crazy.  The \"cooks\" were making some monstrosity that resembled a taco but you had to double fist that sucka. I pussied out and got the mini tacos cause I'm watching my cholesterol. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  My order: Uno de lengua  Uno de al pastor Uno de asada Agua de Pina (comped cause I checked in)  Hot dang! The lengua was fresh, tender, and like butta, none of that chewy, gummy old stuff you get at most places. The asada was also fresh and perfectly cooked, not burnt to a jerky. The al pastor was ok.  The best part, aside from the food, was the staff. They were all smiles as they were comadriando with the regulars, despite the cooky woman lingering at the counter.  Next time I'll try the frijoles.",

    "text": "I was VERY disappointed at this place. I was super hungry after a workout and on a low carb meal plan. It was rated at 4.5 stars and had decent reviews on Yelp.  Unfortunately, my experience tonight was disheartening. I ordered a carne asada salad without the beans and rice, requesting additional lettuce as a replacement.  When I got my order, it looked yummy! Then I go straight for the meat and the carne asada was bland, cold, and chewy. I realize that maybe serving the meat cold is a default here. I prefer my meat warm with my salad as I am accustomed to other Mexican places I frequent. I can be confident in saying I had better tasting carne asada around town.  Another point is that there was hardly any cheese at all. Most Mexican restaurants do not hold back on their cheese. I guess on the salad, cheese is used as a small amount of garnish instead of being part of the meal?  Overall, the staff and service were great. The restaurant was nice and clean. There is plenty of seating available when it gets busy. I may come around for a second visit and try their tacos for comparison to other Mexican eateries around town.",

    "text": "Frijoles on Fleek  How you bean? If you haven't heard, this place is YUMazing! We are beside ourselves with how refreshing and flavorful everything is. It seriously tastes like \"healthy\" Mexican food. Everything we taste overflows with bright flavors and is always grilled up fresh-to-order.  Here's a biggie - I don't even like beans, but these frijoles are holy. Home cooked beans made with soul and love from your best friend's grandmother, yup, that's what they taste like. Not too salty, perfectly plump and moist. Nothing I've ever had before, that's for sure. In the span of 2 weeks we've eaten here 4 times already. So good! And so cheap too! A filling amount of food for 2 is always roughly $20.   The chips and salsa are the first taste of how fresh they are. The chips are freshly fried up and incredibly crispy without being too sharp or hard to bite; the salsa is super refreshing with a slight natural sweetness from the perfectly ripened tomatoes they used. I also splash a few drops of their table-side salsas on my tacos from time to time; though, I prefer the salsa verde (green salsa) for its slightly spicy and welcoming tangy flavor over the simple not so spicy salsa roja (red salsa.) Also, their guacamole is super fresh and vibrant, it really steps up the taco and burrito game.   I always go for the mini taco combo meal with either carne asada, al pastor - or both, if i'm feeling frisky. The meats are always grilled up perfectly charred and juicy. They are right-on with the seasoning too. The combo comes with a side of frijoles and mexi rice - man, those guys truly give them away as the real deal! You can't get beans and rice as good as this anywhere on this side of the valley.   The burritos and quesadillas are no-joke delicious, they are packed perfectly with all the good stuff: juicy meat of your choice, fluffy rice, best beans of your life, sour cream, fresh guacamole, and magic. The most important thing about their burritos and the quesadillas are that they are perfectly proportioned - the right ratio of meat to rice, to beans. This is taken for granted, but it's an art form and Frijoles always gets it right.   Their churros are freaking fantastic! Freshly fried, crisp, yet soft and fluffy in the middle rubbed with a boat load of cinnamon & sugar. Yeah. That's right. They do not skimp on the good stuff! /heavybreathing   We also tasted their nopal salad (cactus salad) and the elote (street corn) - Maybe not my favorites, but they are not bad at all. The cactus salad comes out warm and is just like a chunky salsa, great for dipping chips. I felt that the flavor was weak though, nothing too exciting. If you never tried nopal before, I would say it kind of tastes like okra without the syrupy liquid, fairly mild. The street corn is also too mild in flavor for my liking, but the corn is charred up perfectly, naturally sweet and plump.  And don't even think about leaving without trying their fresh agua frescas - especially their horchata - my absolute favorite! Slightly sweet and not too watered down either. If you can't decide, you can mix 2 flavors and get a gorgeous marbled effect in your drink. I love it!  PRO TIP: if you are thrill-seekers like we are, make sure to request some grilled serrano chilies and onions when you place your order - Crazy spicy! Super flavorful! Makes the meal 10x better!",

For two combos and a corn the total was under $20.   The tacos were really good, my favorite of the two I tried was the al pastor. It was flavorful and they were generous with the meat. The rice and beans were fresh and tasty as well. The corn was grilled, a great addition to the meal.  Everything we tried was great and I'll be back sample more of their menu.",

I had two of them, they come with plenty of meat guacamole salsa and sour cream.  You can opt for the regular two dollar tacos that only come with meat and salsa if you don't want all the extras but I wouldn't skip on all that extra deliciousness, go back to the car look for extra change under the seat and upgrade your tacos to Cadillac! I also tried the shrimp cocktail, it was very good but they need to add octopus and oysters to it to make it perfect, which they promised me they will. Wow! I'm in! You can order your basic fountain drinks or go for Mexican bottled sodas. Difference between American coke and American coke from Mexico? Sugar! Here in the states they use corn syrup and in Mexico they still follow the original recipe which asks for real sugar but that's a whole different review for the coca cola company, this review is all frijoles. They also serve aguas frescas of different flavors, pineapple, melon cucumber horchata and many more. If you can't decide what kind you want they'll give you a taste to try, that's how nice they are. The elote was good, they can use a little help from the elote man on the streets but it was still good, covered with cream, cheese and chile is hard to just eat one.  Not a full service restaurant, you order, you get a number, and the food is delivered to your table but the service you do get is outstanding and it comes with a smile at no extra charge. The place is clean and though they added a few mexican touches here and there does not hide the fact that this place used to be a Pizza Hut but once you try the food you realize it was always meant to be Frijoles.",

Positive:   Staff are very nice and friendly A wide variety of drinks and juices  And that's about it. I paid $25 for 4 steak tacos, a piece of corn, and a coke......... The steak was bland, not impressed at all. I have had Mexican food in Mexico, Chicago, New Mexico, Texas, California, all over Vegas, etc. I do not see myself going back or recommending it. Like I said, very friendly people working there though!",

It's such a treat. It's also great to show support to the family owned restaurants in Vegas.   Everything at Frijoles is fresh and you can taste it. They make there beans fresh everyday along with all their juices.   I will continue to go here and spread the word about them to more and more people.",

(there is no way you can compare Los Frijoles to Roberto's) It is right around the the corner from my house so my husband and I went there for the opening and we loved it! their staff is super friendly, we've often seen the owner in there serving and cleaning tables, talking to people and everything. The aguas frecas are made with real fruit, which is very hard to find. Being mexican I can tell you that if you want real tacos and aguas frescas got to frijoles. the place is always super clean which is always a plus!   Note: I have a cousin who came from Mexico to visit and we've taken her out to eat tacos to many places and she said that the only place that's even close to the real mexican tacos is Los Frijoles.",

    "text": "I am updating my review a little to make notes of a few improvements, my original review remains below.  I already loved this place, and it remains a new family favorite, and it seems to be spreading around my extended family like a virus, as we bring more family back each time.  First, this place is worth the trip just for the delicious drinks that they serve. My wife loves the \"Chia water\" and I can't get enough of the pineapple drink. We find ourselves wanting to go back frequently just for the drinks.  Second, here are the improvements they have made since the last time we ate there: the food now comes out much more quickly, and you no longer need to get up multiple times to get food for your table, because they now give you numbers to place on your table, and then bring the food out to the table. this is a small thing, but really made the visit this time so much better. Thanks to the management for implementing the small changes suggested by the Yelp community. Other than that, our food was again, delicious. My original full review is below.  Lately I have been trying hard to get my kids out and try new places, sometimes that goes over well, other times it doesn't. Tonight, it went over very well.  Don't get me wrong, there is much that others might criticize about the place, but I think that most of that could actually be some of the place's unique strengths. I found Frijoles to be refreshingly unappologetic.  1. The location: Opening a new place in Vegas can be a gamble, especially a place away from the strip and tourism. In this case, that is a good thing. This place isn't for the tourists (although they are missing out if they don't seek out the unique in Vegas), it is for the natives.  2. The menu: There are some unique options on the menu, such as tongue and \"cabeza.\" The meat options on the menu also are in Spanish only, and the cashier had to translate them for my kids. Again, this did not bother me at all, because for us it added to the experience. Tongue is not something that my kids are used to seeing on menus and their disgusted reaction was exactly as I expected it to be, but I like that the place caters to a specific crowd and isn't out to please everyone.  3. The setup: This is an easy one to pick apart, as the line and ordering are different than most are used to (and by most, I mean the Qdoba/Chipotle/Cafe Rio lovers). This is one thing that I would not say is a strength, but it is not necessarily a hindrance either. It is a bit awkward to walk in past the food and not really be able to see the menu until you are up to order, but that is only an issue the first time, after that, you pretty much know the menu for any repeat visits.  4. Fast food?: This is the one critique that I will make on which I would like to see some improvement. The food did come out to us piecemeal and it did take some time. One child's nachos came first, followed by another's fries, then the last three dishes came out all at once. for the first 2 dishes, my number was called and I had to get up to get them, the last 3 were brought out to us. I am totally fine with the food coming out at different times, or getting up to get my food, but not both at the same time. If the food is going to be ready seperately, then it should be brought out to the table. During a busier time having to get up to get out food would have meant having to break through the ordering line due to the setup, so my one big suggestion to the management would be to have the food brought out to the guests.  5. Finally, the food: My whole family thought that the food tasted really good. Between the 5 of us, we had a good variety of the items on the menu, and everyone sampled each dish. I had the carnitas burrito which was good, but after sampling the kids chicken dishes, I wished that I would have gone the chicken route instead. They also have an awesome variety of drinks in addition to the usual fountain drinks. Unfortunately they did not have the pineapple drink tonight, but my wife got the chia seed water, which was really good.  overall, probably not perfect by many standards, but we really enjoyed the food and my kids have a new favorite place for nachos. It is locally owned and offers an authentic taco shop experience.",

    "text": "A fine start for Frijoles I must say.   Now that I'm becoming older and wiser to Yelp ways, it takes more than a fancy 4.5 star average to impress me, particularly in the first few months of a business opening.   It IS enough to get me to read through the reviews though, and what struck me as appealing is that the owner seemed to be very involved in answering any/all critical reviews, and not only that, but they seemed to be adjusting on the fly to customer complaints and demands.   I always like to see that level of commitment and care.     I pretty much knew what I wanted when I entered, and ordering was quick, painless, and friendly.   I went with a mini taco trio and something I saw in the Yelp pics: a combo Pineapple/Strawberry Agua Fresca.   The drink was made instantly and it was love at first sip.   I had noticed a sign that refills were only $1 (the drink itself is $2.50), and I kid you not I was considering trying to drink it all down as fast as I could to indulge in this bargain.   Sadly they were done with my tacos pretty quickly and I was on my way.   Definitely one of my biggest regrets of my life as later back in my office I ran out and craved more.     As for the tacos, I went with two of my usuals: cabeza and pastor, and decided to go against my third usual lengua for the carne asada because it seemed like Frijoles really hypes up their carne on their facebook.   I'm not sure if they're just pandering to the eaters that are terrified to venture beyond the realm of chicken and carne, but I thought it might be their specialty so to speak and gave it a shot.    1)  Cabeza:  It was a good version but I feel I've had better.   Not really sure what could put one cow's head ahead of another (maybe seasoning of the meat?) but it didn't wow me here.  It was still good enough for me to scarf down in 4 bites.   I'd try it again  2)  Pastor:  Best I've ever had.   I'm not some taco connoisseur or anything unlike those maniacs who participate in the Yelp Taco Treks, but I've had maybe 7-8 varieties of Pastor tacos around the valley and this one just hit that sweet spot with a perfect balance of the pork with pineapple.   Perfect.  3)  Carne Asada:   I should have known better, but this didn't really do much for me.   The meat was dry, though it did have a nice flavor otherwise.  It's pretty much what I expect from Carne Asada at most restaurants, I was just hoping it'd be different I guess.   I'll chalk that up to my error as I'm sure most Carne fans would have dug it.  The red salsa was a nice version, not unlike you can find at most decent taco shops, but the green one they provided had an odd texture for me.   It was goopey if that word even exists.   If I turned over the container it wouldnt spill all over my desk immediately, but would slowly ooze out.   That rubbed me the wrong way so I stuck with the red.     So my list of demands should you choose to accept them: 1)  Figure out why the cabeza didn't blow me away 2)  Liquefy the green salsa 3)  Free Al Pastor Tacos and Agua Frescas to Yelp Reviewers during weekdays.  Next time I might get 3 Pastor tacos and that same drink so expect a potential bump to 5 stars at some point.",

Very clean and well decorated Tacos had a layer of cheese that was a nice idea and tasted delicious Great Guacamole Good salsa For some reason the fountain coke was really good Very friendly staff  Down sides Hard to figure out how to order, looks like a Chipolte when you walk in but you order at the opposite side where the register is. No pictures to see what the food will look like. Sneeze guard at head level makes it hard to communicate to staff.  (health dept thing not the restaurants' choice I'm sure.) Very loud in dining room Chips were passable but way too salty.  Possibly try less salt and a finer grain like popcorn salt since a little goes a long way. Expensive for the portion size. Carne tasted washed out like it was sitting in a pan and lost its caramelization.  Maybe I should order fresh off the grill next time? Over all I have high hopes for Frijoles and think they could do very well with a few changes.  Good luck guys!",

Visited Frijoles today with my wife, I ordered 2 chicken tacos with everything but sour cream, chip and guacamole, street corn w/ no mayo, only cheese butter and chilli powder, and an order of rice and beans and a coke. My wife ordered a tostada with no meat, only lettuce, avocado, pico and beans, street corn with only butter and lemon and a sprite. $28.00  We sat down, 10 minutes later they served my tacos, 5 minutes after that we get served our drinks, 5 minutes later we get our chips and guacamole, my wife's tostada and our corn. Then 5 minutes later we realize I never got my rice and beans, so I walked to the counter and reminded them and got that a few minutes afterwards.   My chicken tacos were very good and very fresh tasting. Both of our corns were flavorless and mine wasn't served with chilli powder. My wife's meatless tostada was served covered in meat and had no pico, she sent it back and got it with no meat, but still no pico. I had to go to the counter again to get a side of pico for her. The tostada was soggy and she barely ate it. The chips and guacamole  were good, my rice and beans were great and my coke was amazing. She liked her sprite, she prefers 7-up.  I would go back, my wife is questionable on going back. I will admit, the staff is nice and pleasant, but are managed very poorly.   They received a star for serving coke products, so read this as a 1 star review.",

We got the carne asada burrito combo that comes with chips, salsa, and a fountain drink for $9.99 The chips and salsa (pico de gallo) were bland but at least the chips were freshly made. The burrito was missing flavor and the salsas were mediocre. The 2 stars I'm giving them is for being pet friendly!",

(That's how good it is, I've been a ton) My latest order was through postmates in which a portion of my order wasn't there. I called the store in which they said they would call me back to resolve this matter yet they never did. And that to me is poor service and a reason I can't give them the 5 stars they should have.",

We also ordered a chicken burrito. However, the cashier did not hear my wife order it. No charge and no chicken burrito. She decided to forego it & eat what we already ordered.   I had a coupon for a free agua fresa, so I ordered the pineapple. If you want a refill, there is a dollar charge. So I received a spinach one the 2nd time. The Spinach drink is mixed with orange juice & lime. HIGHLY recommended. I also tried the chia lemonade, which was also amazing. If they ever had passion fruit agua fresa, I would stop there at least 2 or 3 times a week just for that!  The nachos w/ cheese - was just that. Chips with real cheese on top. I was hoping for someone a tad more elaborate, but I didn't argue about it. Maybe some pico de gallo on the side would have made it work?  The cheese quesdadilla was spot on. One of the best I had in Vegas.  The beef burrito was pretty tasty. Once again, I would hope for pico de gallo on the side, or a better choice of sauces. But, it was tasty in its own right.  The prices are not Del taco cheap, but it is comparable to Chipotle.  I will say, for a start up restaurant, I am impressed they have a good following already. I think Frijole's will be alright. We will go at least once a month - and maybe more if a few minor things are ironed out.",

All of them were delicious, and I would go back just for the pineapple one!! They only have 1 size for $2.50. The watermelon and mango were great too!  Along with our 2 drinks, we ordered a carne asada quesadilla, a carnitas burrito, and Mexican street corn. Everything is made to order, and despite being the end of the night, tasted super fresh and homemade. I'm a Chipotle junkie, and I might like Frijoles better. The only thing I missed was the cilantro lime rice & the portions here are smaller. For everything we spent under $20.  The only thing I didn't care for was the street corn. I, unfairly, compare all street corn to Mundo's street corn which is off the charts amazing. And, while Frijoles is probably a more traditional version, it didn't blow mind like Mundo's did.  I would give this place an A overall, and I'm sure I will be a regular customer! They're worth checking out. The menu isn't huge, but what they have they do well and their prices are really affordable.",

The tall guy with dark hair took my order I explained to him it was my first time here and he seemed to care less, he never made eye contact with me and even when I asked for recommendations on the menu I felt he was rushing me to hurry and order cause he had zero desire to help. I ended up ordering a chicken quesadilla a carne asada taco and the street corn and of course the horchata. Trying to find a place to sit for two was difficult not because it was extremely busy but because more than half the tables hadn't been cleaned up. We finally found a table for two and waited about 15 mins for the food needless to say the best part was the street corn and the horchata. My daughters quesadilla was just ok the cheese was not all the way melted and as far as my taco went it had way to much beans on it. On the way out the cook behind the glass said thank you to us that was nice to hear because clearly the guy at the register was annoyed being there.  I'd like to give this place one more shot but it's definitely not a priority anytime soon.",

    "text": "Heard about this place from the viral video \"I need a taco\" so I came to support.  Located in the old red barn Pizza Hut on Charleston, it took us a moment to decide.  The prices were reasonable alacarte or also available in a combo with chips salsa and a drink. After items are ordered they are brought to the table with a number.   I took the AL pastor nachos a basket of crinkle cut fries,  and a bean and cheese burrito. Items came to table quickly and serve in green baskets and the nachos were on a plate. Nachos were a good portion and all toppings were arranged in a stripe pattern instead of layers on top of each other,  I'm guessing to look like a Mexican flag with green, white, and red. They were ok. The frijoles were traditional pinto beans but I felt could have used more seasoning. I also prefer black beans but I'm not that picky.   The food was definitely fresh, while we were there they were grilling peppers and tamatillo's to make some fresh salsa.  Overall I think it was 3.5 stars nothing to be fanatical about but a good place for a quick and inexpensive meal. I want to come back to try a few of there tacos and there Frescas.",

    "text": "The agua frescas were good.  But not enough to bring me back.  Let me explain.   I ordered the al pastor nachos at about 4pm last Friday.  At that time, 4 employees were obviously on their break and eating at one of the booths.  2 employees were behind the counter.  It wasn't busy.  So 2 employees were sufficient.    I ordered at the counter, paid, took my order #, & grabbed a seat.  While waiting for my nachos, I went through emails on my phone.  Every now & then I would glance up to check on my order.   The same gal who took my order & money also assembled my nachos.  She was in the midst of dumping watery beans onto the tortillas when I noticed her.  I paused in reading my emails to watch.  She then added al pastor from a warming tray.  There was a trompo with al pastor spinning in the corner.  Why didn't I get *that* meat?!  Next came cheese & off it went into the kitchen to be melted.  She brought it back out & added the pico de gallo, guacamole, crema, & brought it to my table.    I took a bite...flavorless.  I added green salsa.  Still flavorless.  Red salsa.  Same.  This would be a great dish for someone on a bland diet.  The only thing that made this dish palatable was the Tapatio hot sauce.  Sad.   So I may not have ordered the best dish and was considering trying a different dish.  But while I was eating, I watched  the same gal who took my order & assemble my dish go from task to task without changing gloves!  Gross!   I don't think she had gloves on when she took my order.  But, I'm not 100% sure about that.  Wish I could remember for sure.  She did, however, have gloves on when she assembled my plate.  Then she continued to wear the same pair to take out the trash, clean around the warming trays, stir food in the warming trays, and help the next customer who came in.    I already wasn't impressed with my nachos.  But I completely lost my appetite after watching her.  I threw almost the entire plate away & confronted the worker about changing gloves.  She said she forgot.  Hmmm...how often do you forget to do this?! :/  It wasn't even busy!  I didn't want to involve management on this & get her in trouble.  I just hope that by confronting her, she (& other employees) will be more careful next time.   This unsanitary practice probably happens more often than not in a lot of restaurants.  Ignorance is bliss.  Seeing it with my own eyes though?...I can't deal.  I can't unsee it & therefore, can't come back.",

First off the food is truly amazing the quality of meat is great and this elote is everything ! The way they layer everything each bite is a spark of flavor from different levels sweet from the corn the creaminess butter and the sharpness of the cheese followed by a slight bite from the Chile powder and then to blend it all the lime , some reading the lime juice just brings each individual together as one harmonious family of flavor !!   If you are looking for just good Mexican Americana food and I say that because it isn't your True traditional Mexican food but it's delicious Mexican food nonetheless   The workers are always pleasant and smiling eager to make sure each one is happy. I always see a smiling face which is super nice rather than seeing someone with the Groucho mean mug.    This time I got mini tacos with carne and chicken , elote And that's it.  Next visit and I will be back because the food is so amazing I will try a shrimp burrito! Can't wait   If you're looking for a great drink they have this homemade cucumber mint drink and omg. I tried some I died it was so brisk and refreshing.",

This location however really lacked customer service. I came in and wasn't greeted... The employee at the cash register was just straightening money out (not urgently, so I wasn't sure if it was even required to be doing at that time?) myself and two other guests stood there and waited. I wasn't offered any of the frescas samples even after I told them I have only been to their business once and was interested in getting one but wasn't sure which flavor to try or get.. I asked for a sample and was given a strawberry pineapple combo, watermelon, and spinach. I asked what was most popular and wasn't given an answer. I placed my order and the girl ringing me up looked very unenthusiastic and just wanted to rush the order along and get me out of there. Perhaps it is because I am a gringo? Perhaps its just because sometimes we all have a hard day? I tried not to take it too personal. We ordered a carne asada burrito meal with an upgrade (75 cents) to a fresca (my husband got horchita) and I ordered the taco meal with an upgrade to a watermelon fresca and another side taco for myself and my toddler to share. I also tried to use the yelp check in for a free fountain drink (I figured my daughter would be stealing my watermelon fresca and why not have another drink in case) They would not honor the yelp deal. The food itself was flavorful (skip the chips and salsa) The taco had plenty of avocado on it which made me happy. I don't know if I am likely to return any time soon however after the (lack of) customer service.",

But everyone's review said try everything and we basically did just that.   For appetizers we got the medium shrimp cocktail and the carne asada nachos. Both were pretty good. The nachos beat any kind of bar nachos out of the park!   I had to try the shrimp cocktail. It was good however the shrimp were whole and I guess I expected more of a ceviche.   After we devoured those, I finally got my hands on the main reason I went there. Shrimp tacos. I have been on the hunt for a decent shrimp taco that is going to break the bank. And all I can say is wow! Great flavor and spices, the peppers and onions, just speechless because I'm shoving another taco in my mouth.   My boyfriend got the chicken taco which is currently in the fridge because we are stuffed but I am positive it will live up to the expectations.   I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!",

I decided on the Mexican street corn and a carnitas taco for dine in. I paid at the counter and was given a number to display on my table so the order could be brought to me. After a few minutes a woman delivered my order. She forgot to bring my drink. I explained that when she dropped the food off. She said she would be right back with it. After 5 minutes of watching her take an order from a new customer that walked in,  clean a counter,  and walk to the back I decided to go ask at the counter instead. She seemed genuinely apologetic and I was able to start my meal. The taco was huge and tasty but nothing memorable.  The grilled corn was delicious and juicy with just the right amount of heat. Based on the corn alone I will be visiting this place again.",

    "text": "The Skinny: while the aqua fresca and the meats are good,  I'd pass on the fish, beans, rice and chips (3) service: slow for a fast casual spot with counter service ,  waited 25+ minutes to get any of our food and drink (2), value: it's okay but nothing I am going to rush back for (3).  We stopped by this joint completely starving. Eager for some good Mexican,  we were jived about this place being relatively close by.   We ordered 5 different styles of street tacos($2 each) , a side of beans and rice($2),  and an order of chips and salsa($2). We also got a mixed strawberry/pineapple aqua fresca ($2.50).   After we ordered,  it took a while for the food and even aqua fresca to come out. I believe there was a mix up with our drink which didn't arrive at our table a good 15-20 minutes after we ordered and only after we pointed out we never received our drink. Bear in mind that the restaurant was only about 1/3rd full at 1:40pm on a Friday. This is not a joint where you get in and out quickly.   Finally the food arrived and we devoured it quickly. The good points? The meats, in general,  are solid. The lengua had a nice texture and was flavourful. The carnitas was mildly crispy and tasty. The carne asada had a nice smoky taste but I found it be a bit watery. Al pastor was good but a bit too salty.   The fish taco on the other hand was not quite what we expected. Instead of a whole piece of fish,  it looked like some canned tuna sparsely mixed in with a whole lot of pico de gallo. Meh, the fishy taste and super wet texture really didn't do it for me. I would skip this and order a meat taco instead.   For me,  the beans and rice tasted pretty generic. The beans were lacked adequate seasoning while the rice was just okay.   While their pico de gallo is pretty great,  their chips were subpar. Some chips were overdone while some were not even crispy and were oddly chewy. I think I'd pass on this.   The highlight of the meal was the aqua fresca. The strawberry/pineapple tasted really fresh and housemade. For $2.50, that isn't too bad.   Overall,  given service and the hit or miss items on the menu,  this joint is just okay in my books. I don't know if I have a strong urge to return given the plethora of great options. 3 starred review.",

I would say it was lacking a proper amount of meat. It wasn't horrible but there are places in town that are less priced with bigger servings. It wasn't bad,it just didn't blow my hair back. I think if they increase the size of their servings it would improve my opinion. The togo bag was also packed with a red and a green salsa which I thought was a nice touch. There was no salsa bar which I like but again it wasn't the end of the world,just average.",

Slow service doesn't necessarily bother me, but being ignored does. If a customers is going to sit and wait forever (25 minutes for a to go order), you need to address it. Recognize and apologize for the delay. Show a little empathy. Do something. Anything!   However, the lack of attention and long wait is somewhat offset by the Keystone Cop like performance that the staff puts on. They've got a ton of people behind the counter yelling, grabbing tickets, banging into each other, etc. It's a hoot! The entertainment, though unintentional I'm sure, does help.",

    "text": "Based off a recommendation by my good friend, and my other friends desire for shrimp tacos, we decided to stop in here on Friday around 5pm for dinner. Place wasn't too crowded, but more and more kept showing up so that's a good sign. Located on the corner of Antelope and Charleston.   I ordered the carne asada tostada (3.99), side of mexican corn (2.25) and side of rice and beans (2.00) while my friend had the shrimp taco (8.49 + $1 for shrimp) and the mexican salad.   Carne asada again had little to no real carne asada flavor, kind of bland. Maybe I'm spoiled with good carne asada, but this wasn't it. Mexican corn was tasty but seemed overpriced. Rice and beans were just so-so. I wasn't overwhelmed by the meal.   I might try a few other menu items next time, but next time might be a long ways away because I wasn't super impressed and I thought it just a bit too expensive for what you get. Chances are I'll try Triple Play next for the Philly Cheesesteak, located in the same shopping center.",

I'd scoff at it and keep driving to work.  So when my friends asked if I wanted to try this place for dinner the other night, I was very very skeptical. I mean, in my mind, this had to be the most Americanized Mexican restaurant ever, right?   WRONG. Frijoles & Frescas is actually really really good. The food itself is freshly made, and while not the best Mexican food in town (I hate to say, I prefer the greasy Roberto's carne asada fries), it's pretty decent. They give a good portion, and the carne asada fries are fried fresh. The carne asada itse;f was a little chewy, but had good flavor overall, and the guacamole was great!   However, my favorite thing here are the Aguas Frescas. Seriously, they are soooo good! And you can mix the flavors! So far, my favorite is spinach & strawberry & cucumber. I will eventually get myself to order the chia seed flavor too...maybe mixed with mango?   Tip: Refills of Agua Frescas are only $1 :) Soda refills are free.   Also, I've heard (and seen) that the corn here is delicious....It was so good, my friends forgot to share with me :P",

I ordered a chicken burrito loaded with everything and a strawberry /mango fresca.   The burrito was loaded with beans guacamole rice chicken salsa and cream. Very delicious combination.   The fresca was so refreshing I ended up getting a refill.   My yelp bff ordered chicken nachos and watermelon fresca and loved the flavor.  One regret was the chips were soggy about halfway thru the plate and took away from the initial appeal.   We finished the meal with dessert cheescake chimichangas and a big churro, chimicahangas were custard filled sweetness covered in chocolate drizzle were delicious and the better option. The big churro was overcooked so will pass on it next time.  Overall very good meal for a great price. Can definitely taste the freshness in the flavors of the food and drinks.

    "text": "Once upon a time, I was hungry and my mom happened to be hungry too. Deciding we wanted Mexican, I opened my faithful Yelp app and searched for bookmarks. Frijoles was right around the corner, so to Bean Town we went.  Back in the day, this location as a Pizza Hut. The whole place was updated. The same layout, but now without a tacky salad bar in the middle. Ample table and chairs and several booths. The dining area had soft accents of Mexican art and was incredibly clean.   Frijoles is Roberto's Taco Shop crossed with a Chipotle with a casual cafe feel, with it's simple menu, which consists of Mexican styled meats, you then take the meat a spruce it up as a: mini taco, salad, nachos, taco, fries, or a platter. Drink-wise, your standard Coca-Cola products, Mexican Cokes, and Agua Fresca.  I got a carne asada and an al pastor mini taco, Mexican street corn, and a strawberry-mango agua fresca; my mama ordered the salad with shrimp and an order of chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh. The chips and salsa were chips and pico. My tacos and corn were good. Not Taco y Taco good, but definitely well above Robertos or Pepes. The shrimp salad was stellar. I had order envy after I tasted that creation. Definitely know I will be venturing that route next. Agua Fresca was also a happy surprise. Feeling fancy, I combined two flavors. Sweet, but not in the \"I'm gonna get diabeetus way,\" but in a perfectly ripe strawberry and mango way, just FRESH.  Frijoles is nice option. Nothing that knocked my socks off, nothing that I hated. Authentic, no. Tasty, yes. How can i not like anything that bears the same name as my beloved cat, Beans? Me gusta Frijoles.",

The inside however, is nicely decorated with with plenty of wood and metal (somewhat similar to Chipotle's industrial style) along with Mexican artifacts to give it a distinctly non-pizza vibe.  It's a fast causal, order-at-the-counter spot with friendly service. The carnitas tacos -- filled with tender, moist, and crispy-edged chunks of meat -- were the best items I tried. The al pastor lacked the depth and heat of greater versions around town. The carne asada was solid --  quality meat that was under seasoned but still decent. There are several flavors of agua frescas available with the option of mixing them together. The strawberry mango flavor was so good it was gone before the food hit the table.  3.5 Stars",

    "text": "This location used to be a pizza hut.  It was lunch time. I have seen the place prepping for opening for awhile now and as I drove by I saw they were open. A new place, gives me a chance to Yelp, turned around and went back to try it.  The staff was friendly, the place was clean, the have red and green sauces at the tables, they were both good.They have a fairly good selection to choose from and a good selection of the Mexican style drinks horchatca, fresa (strawberry), pina (pineapple), mango etc.. They were giving out samples of the drinks.  I had a carne asada burrito, it's just a burrito, no sides, $6.95 plus $1.50 for cup of soda. It was similar to the carne asada burrito at Roberto's taste wise. The burrito at Roberto's is $7.35, but it comes with sides of rice and beans, it includes a drink (lunch special).  The carne asada was too grizzly, several pieces too tough to chew through. When I hit the first piece I spit it into a napkin and continued eating, did the same with the second piece. When I hit the third piece, I was done. I saw them bring out the meat, so they chop it there, perhaps they could cut the large pieces of grizzle out, before chopping it up. Eating shouldn't be a physical challenge. It's a shame since the flavor was good, as I said, the taste reminds me a lot of Roberto's,   If I was rating just on the burrito I had, it would be one star. I gave the extra star because the staff was great and helpful, more help than I needed, I know enough Spanish to understand the menu and the different drinks. But, more help is better than too little.   They have a variety of meats to choose from, so the other meats may be fine, I can't say. You may want to give them a try.   I was really hoping it would be good, because it is convenient and not in with a group of food places, where the parking gets chaotic at lunch time. Since I like carne asada and will eat somewhere else and have carne asada, rather than order something else so I can eat here, I can't see me coming back.  They are new, only open for a couple of weeks, hopefully they will work out the bugs.",

I usually order the mini tacos, shrimp cocktail or nachos.  Green and red salas are at each table and you can't leave without  trying an Agua Fresca.  The food is made to order and although a bit pricier than your typical Robertos or other taco shop...you get what you pay for in quality.  We will continue to visit this restaurant :-)",

I'm not afraid of grease and fat by any means, but my quesadilla was swimming in grease. The bottom side of the tortilla got so soggy that toppings were falling out. It was a mess. Flavorwise it was tasty. The steak was well seasoned and there was plenty of cheese.   The husband ordered tacos, we don't remember what kind. He got his to go and it was so greasy that the paper bag tore. He did enjoy them and says he wishes there were more.   The guacamole was small for the price. It had too much raw onion for my taste. It's not something that I would order again from there in a hurry.  I enjoyed the different salsas at the table.",

So when craving fish tacos I thought going to Frijoles would satisfy my craving, NOPE. The fish in the tacos was minced really fine, it looked mushy. It had a load of warm sour cream on top too. I don't mind sour cream but it being warm made me feel like it wasn't stored properly.  The shrimp taco wasn't bad but nothing memorable. I also had the the el pastor mini taco which was not yummy at all. The pork was also minced super small and was hard. Like it was minced and laid out for a while.  The pinapple fresca was pretty good though. I don't know if I romanticized my last experience but this time around the tacos seemed different. I don't remember the fish being so mushy at all... The service was good though. Ladies behind the counter are very nice and my tacos did not take long. Restaurant and bathroom are clean.",

I'm always on the fence when it comes to Mexican food (due to a food poisoning event I had in the past & the fact it just always seems so oily in general) -- but to my surprise, this place's food is very fresh & not at all heavy like I expected it to be! Nothing was greasy and had amazing flavor without being overly salty.    I ordered:  - CHICKEN SALAD  - CHICKEN TOSTADA  Not a fan of beans so I requested none on both. They use traditional dark meat, not white chicken breast -- which is more fatty but definitely gives it so much flavor! My coworker's also swear by their steak quesadillas and carnitas burritos, but I'm already in love with their chicken. Will definitely be frequenting this place more since it's just down the street from work! ;)  NOTE: Closed on Sundays.",

It's all good but my fav's are the grilled shrimp tacos which have just the right amount of kick!  My wife's fav, and a close second for me is the grilled chicken salad.   The selection freshly made juices are also amazing. Call me crazy but a love the spinach juice which had a good mix of spinach, orange juice and a hint of lime!  This place has a great vibe for a small venue and without the crazy prices.  Hands down the best Mexican grub on the west side of Vegas!",

Everything tasted super fresh and the way everything was cooked was a change from the styles i've had here in Atlanta from taco places.   Needed more Jose Luis tho.",

The tortilla was soft with slightly crispy edges. The chicken, which had a strong  charbroiled taste, was mixed into avocado and sour cream, making a soft and moist filling. I quite liked it! The chips were average, but good. And the guacamole was fresh and not overly spicy. Since it's close to CSN, I'll definitely come back between classes for a quick lunch.",

The food although good, was nothing better than a Los Taco or Tacos El Gordo and with Gordo being $2 this place is really bleh to me at more than double. I had the \"street corn\" as well and i tasted more the crap thats on the corn than the corn itself. And it was not the crips, fresh tasting corn as if it was recently prepared it was closer to mushy like it been cooked previous and then warmed and served.   I really just do not see why people are making such a big deal of the place, and  are being real let down by Yelp hype these days. Id say the best thing they have going for them is the Yelp hype and their presentation from the pics since thats what sold me on coming here.",

This by far surpasses any robertos or don tor taco type taco shop . It would be a shame to even catorgize them with those taco shops .   Your order with cashier thAt is aligned next to ppl making fresh food ( almost like chipotle) . The menu is basic and easy to follow. Then you sit at a table and your food is brought to you .  The service was so welcoming and polite and the food was even better . I wish I lived closer to this place because I would be there all the time .

I get that it's cheaper to use the whole chicken, dark meat included, and the dark meat doesn't dry out as easily but I don't like the taste and fattiness of it. I'd be willing to pay extra if they had a white meat option. The nachos were different than expected, maybe not as much cheese as the Americanized nachos we are used to. If in the area, we will definitely stop in for the frescas again.",

    "text": "So the food WAS amazing here and we use to go once a week but the customer service is deteriorating and every time we visit now is a new issue with the staff. Last time I went they shorted us on everything and made everything in such small portions. They get offended if you ask for more salsa as they give you two for a whole family meal. Which might I add they barely fill up now. I get the shrimp ceviche tostada and it keeps getting smaller every time I order it and not prepared as well like they don't even take the time to cut the shrimp in pieces anymore, they will even short you on the tostada and you have to ask for it wtf? They also use latex gloves which most people are allergic to and I had to find out the hard way the other day. Luckily I don't go into anaphylactic shock from it but man you guys handle food, use proper gloves for your customers and people don't want to taste that!!! I use to love this place but after my child getting food poisoning from their beans and chips and my allergy to latex. Then seeing how they want to give way less but have you pay more then other Mexican places it's lost its value for me. I will be hunting for a better place to go now for mexican food.",

Great size shrimp, delicious and mouthwatering. No doubt it would be great in a taco or burrito. Perfect carnitas, just a little crispy and moist at the same time, great flavor.   I love the variety of aguas frescas, I chose watermelon with pineapple added to it.   Definitely coming back, wish one was closer!   Would love to have seen a condiments bar with lime, salsas, onions/cilantro and maybe some radishes!",

My bf had a burrito meal and I had the mini tacos meal. The burrito was dry and so were my tacos. I could've made better tasting tacos at home, they were also bland...The meat had no flavor and it was dry as well. The only good things about our meal were my horchata drink, which wasn't too sweet, it was perfect! The chips were also good and crunchy. Other than that our experience was far from great. Last thing...overly expensive. We could've paid the $20 and would've had a better meal at Los Tacos.",

    "text": "So I tried this place, and it was just okay. A step above Roberto's in my opinion. We ordered the carne asade fries, chips and guacamole, and the al pastor burrito to share. The inside of the burrito was wet. I am assuming it was from the beans, but I don't like wet burritos. The beans overpowered the flavor of anything else, so unfortunately I can't say whether or not the al pastor was good. Next time I would order the burrito without the beans. The fries were fine, I liked the flavor of the carne asada. The chips and guacamole were good. The guac was fresh and the chips appeared to be made in-house.   The service was just okay. The workers seemed bothered when we would ask for a drink (soda) refill. I hate when the drinks are behind the counter instead of self serve. I understand the agua frescas and horchata being behind the counter, but the soda fountain?? Also there was no salsa bar. They did have 2 salsa's on the table though, a red and a green. My suggestion is to put a salsa bar and have the beans on it, since this place is called Frijoles.  Also, bring the soda fountain out to the front. Maybe I  would come back for the shrimp cocktail that looked really fresh, and possibly the elote.  Yelp 2015 Review #15",

Nothing is greasy and they give you a lot for your buck. Every taco comes with guacamole and they don't charge extra for it like most places. They make fresh juices everyday...I believe they have strawberry, watermelon, mango, pineapple & spinach. I mixed spinach with pineapple & I will order it every time :D you have to try the Street Corn as well...it melts in your mouth and has the perfect amount of queso & Cheyenne",

Chips n salsa were plentiful and actually more than enough.. I prefer the green tomatillo sauce rather than the red.. They do it fresh here and seemed to be on point. Ordered up n paid n food was brought out to table several minutes later after the chips n salsa... Id recommend this placed ur in the area and I'll def be back to try more items on the menu. Seems to be a \"go to\" spot for those that \"know what's up\"! Jamaica was on ice and helped finish Monday's lunch off!! Good move, get it in at this spot if r in this side of town!

The line for lunch was long, we thought this place muuust be good.   However, we weren't too pleased with it..nothing really stood out to us except their Agua Frescas. mix a flavor with horchata, i got strawberry horchata and i enjoyed it!   The menu is fairly simple. We both got a burrito, my sister shrimp & i got carne asada.. don't be fooled by the menu though, be sure to ask what each meat burrito comes with! Because on the menu it says what is in a burrito .. but a shrimp burrito comes with fajitas (waaay too much fajitas) & rice ..when my carne asada burrito came with beans, very wet. Which i didn't know it would make my burrito soggy, the carne asada was also very salty!   We also ordered the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was very spicy.. chips had waaay too much salt! (SEE PHOTO) Along with Mexican Street Corn, too much chili powder when we asked for it on the side because my sister doesn't do spicy. It was really spicy!  It is safe to say I only really enjoyed the Strawberry Agua Fresca and horchata. Hopefully my next experience here will be better than this.",

    "text": "Came here with my hubby one day after our doctors appointment since it was near by and we were craving some Mexican food. The restaurant is across the way from hush puppies and is a small on the inside.   The seating looked dated, but once you walk in you walk straight to the counter and order. We ordered carne asada and al pastor tacos and a shrimp quesadilla. We did go back for a Watermelon angus Fresca because it looked really good on their menu and got a free drink with yelp check in.   Overall, the food was good. I enjoyed the watermelon drink more though. I like that they have a location closer to our side of town so I can try other things on their menu when I'm craving Mexican food again.",

Let me start out by saying the second I took a bite of the food I texted several friends how great it was (with pictures included)   I had to try three different mini tacos to see which I would like most, Al Pastor, Lengua, and Carnitas, each one was equally delicious. The freshness of the onions, cilantro, and salsa just added to the greatness of each meat.   As a huge fan of burritos, I got the Carne Asada burrito with avocado, sour cream, pinto beans, pico, and cheese. It was packed with flavor and freshness. All the meat is grilled do don't expect the greasy norm!  The staff was impeccable. The lack of a self serve salsa bar won't stop you from getting what you want from any of helpful crew here.   I will be back to enjoy more from Frijoles.",

Very unlike most Mexican restaurants.  Service: Poor. Was not greeted. Waited at the unmanned register for about 3 minutes. There were no smiles. It was very unwelcoming. When the food was placed on the table.. It was silently placed on the table.. No words, no interaction very humdrum type of stuff here..  Food: I ordered the \"Fries\" with carne asada.. I believe the fries were fried in too low of temperature oil because they were very chewy.. and they were left in too long making a crunchy chewy abomination. The dish was very bland, the Pico De Gallo didn't add any acidity to the plate. The steak while underseasoned did give off a grilled flavor which was nice.. The fries were the big crinkle cut fries which I personally feel is a bad vehicle for carne asada.. My wife had the Chicken salad. She was not very opinionated about.. \"It was just alright for her.\" Seeing as how she eats a lot of salads and has told when her salads are really good, this one is probably not that good but I didn't eat it. We shared an order of Cheesecake Chimichangas. That dish alone earned you another star. It was good, sweet, had this great glaze on it and I can't think of anywhere else you can get them.  Would I come back? Probably not and on top of that I would not recommend it to my friends.",

I had a steak burrito, the carne asada was decent but a bit to mushy for my taste.   they heap guac on their tacos which is good. the el pastor is not the best i've had, but the big tacos are decent for the price.   LOVE their agua frescas... all are delicious, yes even the spinach. Good place to go if you're looking for a quick fix, but obv does not compare to dirty street tacos from the streets of LA or SD.",

    "text": "Frijoles and Frescas is a small Mexican fast food restaurant located in an old Pizza Hut building.  It serves mostly al a carte items such as tacos and burritos with side dishes at an extra charge.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  My take-out ordered was a chicken taco ($4.50), a marinated pork burrito ($7), a side of Mexican corn ($2.50), a side of rice and beans ($2) and a watermelon agua fresca ($2.50).  Although the taco was delicious it didn't travel well and was a mess to eat by the time I got home.  The burrito arrived perfect and was also delicious, the corn on the other hand was mushy and soggy and really uneatable, but that's par for the course when getting corn on the cob at a restaurant.  I wasn't really expecting the corn to be good, but I thought I'd give it a try.  The rice and beans were the best I've ever had at a fast food style Mexican restaurant and the watermelon fresca was good but as usual too sweet for me so I usually add ice water when I get home and it cuts the sweet and makes it a nice refreshing drink.  I think Frijoles and Frescas is one of the best fast food Mexican restaurants in the area.",

It took longer than expected but was very good.    I would say smaller portions than expected from  what you are used to with a Tex-mex type restaurant.   It seemed much \"lighter\" and fresher than usual Mexican cuisine.    The guacamole was very good - but very different than what we are used to.    We did not try the drinks so can't comment on those.    I would recommend and return.",

The staff is nice and working hard. Very focused and diligent. I CANNOT believe how plain it looks from the outside, cause inside it's definitely not expected. Love the booths and wood tables and chairs. It's beautiful!!!  Check it out. I'll post when I get home about how good it is. I already know I'm going to love  ....  So I had the mini tacos asada, and they were really good. Like the ones you can eat in 2-3 bites and you want to eat 10 of them if you could. The quesadilla with chicken & shrimp was pretty good. Ate it with their homemade guacamole which is REALLY good guac. Ordered the bag of chips and guac which is a bit high for what you get. But then it was perfectly enough. The chip bag seems like it's small, but it was perfectly measured with the amount of guac.  I'm actually here right now ordering more tacos.  Their homemade tomatillo salsa is good. Want to try some more things on the menu. Will have to come back for a sit down with some friends soon.",

The chips needed salt. My tacos where kinda wet from the salsa which was flavorless. We ordered fish ceviche, it tasted mostly like diced white onion and I hated that it was served on a torta because that just got wet and soggy, we didn't eat it all if that's any indicator it wasn't very good.  My friend and I came here together wanting some good Mexican food and margaritas! News flash, they don't serve alcohol here. My tacos where very eh okay. I ordered some steak tacos for my husband to go and those where dry! Steak had good flavor but the tacos where just dry and not what anyone expects with the steak style tacos.  My friend got a shrimp burrito though and she was very happy with it. And it was clean inside the dining area. Service was subpar.",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas! I recently moved offices from Henderson, to Charleston and Rainbow. I passed this restaurant every day, and always noticed this restaurant, on my way to lunch.  About 3 weeks ago, we ordered lunch from Frijoles and Frescas. I was amazed by the taste of the Steak Burrito! I was instantly hooked! Last week, I met my wife there for lunch. She also was instantly hooked.  Today, I met a friend there, and he was very pleased.  I've eaten a lot of Mexican food in my 42 Years on this planet. This is the best I've ever had! It's my new favorite Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas.  They have 2 locations. Both are a short ride from the Vegas Strip. Spend a few bucks on an Uber or Lyft, you'll save at least $8.00 per person.  I'm going back in a few days! I highly recommend Frijoles and Frescas to not only locals, but tourists too!",

Mind you the tip we made was in cash. I called numerous times without a response and still waiting. They even gave me a managers number to call directly and still nothing. I doubt we will be back...if this was your account you would be just as upset. Super disappointed",

When you place A pick up order, then you get home and  half of the order is missing, the least I would expect is an apology. But instead the assistant manager says I can make it for you! Come back, that's the best I can do! No disregard for me having to drive back! No disregard for half of my family not being able to eat, having to watch the others eat Their food! The last thing I expected is an attitude from the manager. I payed for this food. Need to be reimbursed for this.  Your food is great! Your downfall will be your complacent employees.",

I went there when they just had opened and it was very delicious and  customer service was great. But now every thing has changed everything has declined there. I do not recomend them. It was a Waste of money",

You'll surely miss it...if you don't know about it. We are in the first time. Ok place to grab a good spot..nice and clean. They have a tv for entertainment that mostly plays sports. I had the mini taco carnitas plate first time. Great, yummy flavor..the meat was a little dry, but I just threw some pico on that..and we were back to business lol. This is my second visit and I choose takeout for lunch...I ordered the al pastor, and I can't wait to try it.",

Just FYI the \"mini tacos\" are not mini, they're standard size street tacos and the \"tacos\" are huge and loaded with all the fixin's; whole seasoned pinto beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, etc. So good!!! I tried my husbands al pastor meat and it was addictively good! Sweet and rich in flavor. We also ordered aqua frescos (I think that's what they're called, the fruit juice drinks) and I've never had anything more refreshing! The manager Greg let me get two flavors so I had pineapple and mango! Amaaaaaazing!! Everyone was very friendly too. The manager even walked to our table and took the time to talk with us and was so kind and welcoming. Very incredible service, has a very family feel to it. Definitely plan to come back whenever I'm in Vegas and try their nachos, fries and maybe a burrito too and recommend you try this place.",

I don't experiment a lot with with different orders, heck it is Mexican food; all the same ingredients; meats, beans, cheeses and tortillas, it just a matter of how you like it presented and in what proportions (although they do have the best corn on the cob if you don't mind gaining a pound after one meal). I know what I like and it has always been hot, juicy and great quality. One thing I do customize is the fresca; 90% Horchata, 10% Strawberry Juice. Sometimes they mess up on the percentages but that allows me to explore a new blend...but they always get it right on the refill :). Definitely worth a visit!!!",

We also tried the carne asana nachos, which were excellent. The chips were homemade and very good. All in all a good experience and we'll be back. Only complaint I had, which is not at all the owners fault, was the family with 5 kids too many. If you're going to take your family out to dinner and bring your small children be courteous of those around you. Parents were too busy talking to each other to notice their kids running around screaming in the restaurant. So rude! If you can't control your children in a public place, stay home!!",

    "text": "Finally, someone gets it. This place has not disappointed me, and I grew up in mexican food mecca (San Diego) and lived in LA so I know what I'm talking about.    Burritos:  Three weeks ago I ordered a carne asada burrito. Excellent quality meat, a great marinade and a good sized burrito for about one dollar more than the cheap hole in the walls charge. The ingredients set it above and beyond all other places I've tried, which is about 12-13 other places (I was searching for my go-to place).   Two weeks ago I had a carnitas burrito, double meat. Excellent and didn't skimp on the extra meat. The carnitas were still the best I'd had in town, but not ever. The carne asada was on par with the best carne asada i've ever had, though.  Came in today and got a double meat carne asada burrito. Again, perfect, large. Inspired me to finally write this review.  Salsa: The red salsa is not spicy, but has a lot of flavor. If I recall my first time here, there are actually two reds and one green. The green was alright, but I am biased because verde has never been my thing. One red was darker than the other I believe. None were spicy. That would be my only criticism of this place. There should be a hot hot red option.  Customer service:  Excellent. I have placed orders via phone twice. Once I called, and nobody picked up, so that was a bummer. But, they promptly picked up this time. When inside, the owner was genuinely nice and excited about his product. He remembered me three weeks later. It really doesn't feel like a Mexican food place because everyone is nice, attentive and everything is spotless.   A restaurant has to be either incredibly good or incredibly bad for me to leave a review, even though I yelp every restaurant I go to. This earned a review. Check this place out.",

Here's what I love about Frijoles from the time I walk in:  interior design (love the barn wood ceilings), clean decor, friendly customer service, a massive agua fresca bar (what?), and freaking delicious food.  Add the fact that they brought my meal to me with a metal fork (again, what?), fantastic sauces were at the tables, and the owner came over and introduced himself and asked me about my experience, and I'm a repeat customer.  Guaranteed.  High fives all around, caballeros!  Do you franchise?  Let's see some more stores, muchachos!",

After watching people going and coming around me I asked a server what happened to my order.  She came back with some of my order and left. I waited some more and finally went up to the counter where the guy was making the food.  He knew who I was and told me it would be a minute.  I asked him why he had passed me over  on the food and he said \" I know \" It went down hill from there.  Next day I called to speak to the manager/owner Greg, left my number 2x and never received a call back.  Absolutely horrible service.....Still trying to figure out why I was singled out ???",

The food was very fresh, and very good quality. I got the taco platter with beans and rices, and ordered a side of chips and guacamole.  I like it, fresh tasting as I said, but I found it a little on the bland side. I like zesty tasting Mexican food and this was a little more neutral for the average person. But the quality shined through and I'll be back.   Staff was very friendly and helpful. I felt welcome in their establishment.",

    "text": "Ive been meaning to try Frijoles for a while, so my husband and I headed over there tonight even though it's a bit of a hike from our 'hood. I tried the taco meal with al pastor meat and the Mexican street corn, while my husband did a quesadilla and nachos, both with carne asada. My taco was great, the rice was tasty and cooked well, and the street corn was awesome! We lived in Idaho for a year and I frequented the BEST elote truck ever and I've been searching for a place in Vegas to fill that void-Frijoles has got me covered! The food was super fresh. I think next time I'd go for two tacos, because I skipped the beans (I know, basically blasphemy when the restaurant is literally named for the beans, but I'm just not a fan) so I was hungry a few short hours later.  I took a bite of my husband's quesadilla and it was good-but I wasn't able to snag a bite of nachos because he devoured them, so they must have been good as well. I didn't try any of the beverages, but I'd definitely like to next time. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you. However, we bussed our own table because we weren't really sure what the protocol was for that. I also really don't mind cleaning up after myself so it's no biggie. Service and food were great-we'll be back!",

My husband ordered the shrimp Quesadilla and his had too much cheese go figure...lol. I think the thing that got me the most is if i am thinking there is no cheese on it most would of asked if i would like more added right? He just said yep it's in there it all the meat hiding it(which was not the case) and handed it back.The taste was good but I think it should of been toasted longer when I ate it it did not make me feel like i was eating a Quesadilla. I gave this 3 stars because the food was tasty and fresh but not satisfying my Quesadilla craving.",

We have some good Mexican food on the east coast, but this, this was something else. Each dish had a hint of east coast Mexican, but the rest of the favors were like nothing else we had ever tasted.   The small tacos were only a few bites, but each one was bathed in a rich, red sauce. The carne asana was full of beef flavor, even in such a tiny taco. It was full of additions I couldn't even recognize, but all the favors pulled together to create a party in the mouth.   I got the shrimp quesadilla for my main. It cost something like $6.50, and was so big I had to take half home. The shrimp were big, and bathed in some kind of creamy sauce that I don't have words for. It contained veggies, guacamole, cheese and I don't know what else, but I didn't care because it was delicious.   To top off, Arturo, the video guy came over and chatted. He was funny, delightful, genuine and truly interested in us. I hope this restaurant takes off; Las Vegas is lucky to have it.",

The kind of kick that sticks to your tongue and makes your nose run, but doesn't have you running to the counter asking for leche. Did I mention they have elote? It had the perfect combination of flavors with enough juicy goodness to appreciate the charred kernels. We generally opt for the courtesy cup of water, but we're persuaded to buy an Agua fresca after numerous samples of various concoctions were offered.",

    "text": "Went here today for the first time.  It was really good & for sure this is going to be a new regular spot for me to go too.  I ordered 3 things...Bean & Cheese Burrito, Chicken Burrito and a Chicken Quesadilla.   I gave my husband the Chicken Burrito which he said was \"excellent\" and better than Chipolte, which he loves!   I got the chicken Quesadilla without guacamole & it was delicious!   I ate the whole thing.  The bean & Cheese burrito is saved for later as I wanted to get two items in case I didn't like one.  That was just \"ok\".  Next time, I will definitely order the quesadilla again or maybe try the tacos.  The only thing I can say which was weird was the red sauce was tasty but kinda thick & came out in big lumps... not really a \"sauce\".  Not sure if it was a fluke or if it's always like that. ?   Anyway, the restaurant seemed really clean, organized and the staff was really nice & the environment seems welcoming.   I would give it 4.5 stars if you can give a half star.  If the bean & cheese burrito was a little better & the sauce I would have given it a 5.   I noticed lots of people ordering those fresco drinks & I will be ordering one of those next time as well. I am thrilled I found this new local spot!  Go there if you haven't yet!!!  I am back to edit my review.  Went again tonight.  The \"sauce\" was perfect. Have no idea why it was lumpy last week but I am leaning towards a 5 on this place.  How do you give 4.5 stars?  Anyway, I am going to go couple more times and solidify my star rating once and for all for this little gem.   Also tonight I got a strawberry fresca drink and yes, it is pretty good.  Seems a little creamy-- in a nice way.   Refreshing for sure! I think it's fresh juice so healthy is always great!",

    "text": "Finally we found a great Mexican place to eat. Thanks to the many great yelp reviews, we made this hot spot one of our top places to eat. When we first arrived they hardly had any customers at about 5pm, so we were a little concern. Nevertheless we got right into the menu and ordered our food.  The menu was simple but very tempting. As we sat down to wait for our food, we were offered chips and salsa. The chips were great, but the salsa was borderline. For our main dish, we ordered the carne asada taco with beans and rice. It was loaded with good stuff, like avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and much more. The flavors were amazing and the beans and rice complimented the plate. We also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was loaded with shrimp and mixed very well. Then to top it off, we ordered the grilled corn on a cob. It tasted just like back home if not better. The strawberry horchata was so sweet, it tasted like a strawberry shortcake in a cup.   Overall, our visit was good, great place and great food. Now one of our favorites!",

They had rice, beans, pico, and guac with the meat.   The kids in our group had nachos. We also ordered chips and salsa and guac. Everything was delectable and reasonably priced.

    "text": "Many of my friends and family encouraged my husband and I to go here and get what they deemed the best Mexican food around for a good price.   When we got there we informed them it was our first time there and needed time to look over the menu. While deciding what to eat, they gave us samples of the different frescas that they offer. We tried all of them being the adventurous people we are, and I would never drink cucumber or spinach again, both were terrible. Their frescas are the only reason I even gave them a star, that and Yelp doesn't give you another option.   I ordered a steak burrito with avocado on the side and my husband ordered the chicken nachos. Now, let me say that we've eaten at many establishments prior to coming here, so our expectations were a bit higher because everyone told us how it was better than X, Y, or Z. So, we got our chips and salsa and his chips and guacamole. He said the guacamole had decent flavor but the salsa on the other hand had no flavor. I'm used to salsa, not pico de gallo, and even most pico de gallo's have good flavor, where this did not.   Then our food arrived. It all looked good, but the first thing we both noticed was the amount of greasy cheese on his nachos and the beans. Now, I know that they make their own beans, but they are disgusting, in our opinion. My burrito was covered in them as were his nachos. We ate around them as best as we could, but it was difficult seeing as how it was on everything (hence the name of their establishment).   As we both got sick after eating here, we will not be returning again.",

Ordered a strawberry mango fresco with three mini tacos of al pastor, cabeza and lengua which I abosolutely love. And just with three mini tacos , I'm already full. The flavors were amazing unless I haven't had tacos in a while but there salsa verde had a really good kick to it too. The texture of the lengua and cabeza were and always will be my favorite. Definitely recommended. The place is quaint it's in the corner of Antelope and Charleston so super convenient if you go to school as the West Charleston campus of College of Southern Nevada. Though I am upset that they're not open late enough but much respected because I wouldn't want to work past 9p or 10p either . The only thing I haven't seen it busy so I can't give any tips for their rush hour but I did enjoy the space they had on a slow time after class. Again, check them out! I look forward in trying the rest of their menu and drink options !",

    "text": "These tacos are huge!!! And they taste really good. I ordered a carnitas taco combo which included rice and beans and came with a soda which I upgraded to their famous horchatas. I got the strawberry horchata and it was so good! I also ordered a mini carne asada taco which is basically a normal sized street taco. The carnitas taco was ginormous and came with guacamole. I left of the pico de gallo and the sour cream. The carnitas was cooked very well and had a lot of flavor. My only disappointment is that in the last two bites I tasted pure garlic which makes me think a clove wasn't taken out of that batch. Other than that I was more than satisfied. I will definitely be going back next time I come to Vegas! Can't wait to try their other horchatas and agua frescas and different tacos, burritos, and quesadillas!!!",

Kind of wish the wish the fish tacos were covered in a batter and fried, but either way it was delicious! The only problem I had was that the sauces provided in the table were dirty and close to being empty. Keep the food the same but please fill you the bottles more cos that hot sauce is amazing!",

The freshness and quality of food that this restaurant serves is mind blowing / mouth watering delicious with so much flavor down to the last bite.   I have introduced over 5 friends to Frijoles and all now are regulars. *Today's visit probably has to be my 30th visit or so between their 2 locations in the last 2 years. I should be a share holder if they had stock.   Love how this restaurant is Consistent with the Quality of food that they make. The employees have always been very friendly and accommodating.   The Steak Tacos & Steak Burrito with adding sour cream and guacamole is so darn addicting.   Pros: Quality ingredients Friendly staff Reasonable prices Good size portions  Clean restaurant   Cons: None of their 2 locations are not close to where I live  I wish they had a loyalty rewards card.  (Like Zaba's & Chipotle have)   * * FYI - If you check in on Yelp, you get a FREE Soda!",

    "text": "We've been trying to get into this place for weeks. Something about Mexican food for me is that you have to be in the mood for it, stars in the universe have to align just right ,not to mention it helps to be in the area. One thing that caught my eye is their closed in Sunday's, on their door it says we take care of you and take care our employees by giving them Sunday's off (not exact verbiage).   You walk in and it has a Chiptole or Cafe Rio style type serving method. Assembly line where they take your order along the way. I ordered the quesadilla and a large shrimp cocktail, apparently the shrimp cocktails are bomb ass and the pictures from fellow yelpers looked good to! After you pay they give you a number for your table and you sit your ass down and wait.   We didn't have to wait long at all, fast service! I wasn't impressed with my quesadilla, I felt they could have filled it up more (picture of inside attached), stingy with the meat! The redeeming factor was the shrimp cocktail. HOLY SHIT! this was definitely a homage to the shrimp gods as I was more than satisfied with this. Tons of shrimp, the flavor was really good to.   One thing I didn't like was when they brought the food I asked for water and the server just pointed to the machine. It's like really!? After I tipped a few bucks (uncomfortable if you don't, since it's on the receipt and they stare at you). She points to get it myself. I know I know I get it, it's not fine dining but if that's the case then put a tip jar there not a tip spot on the receipt then pretty much tell me to get the drink myself. Cause then your just another fast food place.   Come here for the shrimp cocktail, it's totally worth the $15, will be returning for this.",

I also got Ceviche which also had no special flavors to it. It was just shrimp and avocado. It was a little too sour for my tests buds. I know ceviche is made with lime but mine could use a little less lime.   The street corn didn't contain enough mayo, cheese or chile (or whatever they put on it). The chips and salsa was a good start through. It had the right amount of spicy to it.  The workers were all very kind and attentive.

    "text": "I think Frijoles is Robertos fancier cousin. I do love Robertos but Frijoles has a wide assortment of fresh juices that you can mix together . I also like the fact that I can enjoy my food in a restaurant instead of sitting in a gas station.  I've come here on two occasions both times I did get the Elote (Mexican corn) . It has mayo, hot spices, crumpled cheese rolled on the outside.  It sounds weird but it is good! It isn't good for you though. I also  had a carne asada quesadilla which is steak meat, Pico De Gallo , cheese , guacamole in a tortilla. It was flavorful!   I usually only trust Robertos with my carne asada fries but Frijoles does a great job! I was worried at first because they make theirs with thick fries. Since they drain the grease from the fries really well you don't end up with big grease drenched fries. The fries are cooked to a golden brown. Then the fries are topped with meat, cheese , pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole.  It's a meal within itself!   If you are craving Frijoles on a Sunday you are out of luck because they are closed. You can savor the taste for Monday.",

Today my husband and I tried a few new things, a salad, a burrito and their version of ceviche.   Salad was big with rice and beans, plenty of greens and salas, choice of meat, we tried the pork, tender chunks, moist and cripsy at the same time.   Burrito was carne asada and also had rice and beans, generous portion and flavorable.   The shrimp ceviche was a tall beer stein full of plenty of shrimp, chunks of guacamole, shreded cilantro all in spicy tomato juice.   The menu offers many choices, the drinks look refreshing although we did not try some today, they're on the list for next time. The  food is fresh and tasty. Good experince and we'll be back!",

Before my order I tried the el pastor and it was delicious, obvious reason why I chose it for my burrito.   Dove into my burrito and it was great as I expected. Added fried pineapples to it, I suggest you do the same! Great spot, awesome customer service and very clean. Overall 4.5/5. I'm here til Sunday(it's Thursday), I just might be back 1 more time. Great job Frijoles and Frescas! I've never bean more satisfied! (Check their shirts)",

    "text": "Healthy Mexican food- sounds like an oxymoron, doesn't it? With a name like Frijoles, I was expecting canned refried beans and other quintessentially unhealthy Mexican dishes here but was pleasantly surprised!  Interior of this former Pizza Hut is totally transformed with upscale seating and lighting fixtures and some Aztec decor, and piped-in music fits perfectly with the ambiance here. Wish they had to space to add in a patio!  Menu is simple: tacos, burritos, nachos, and various other dishes, pick your meats, plus additional sides (ELOTE!) and drinks (AGUAS FRESCAS!)  Initially came in for just a snack- got the lengua nachos, street corn, and a watermelon agua fresca. Both were delicious and fresh, and I really appreciated how the nachos were not drowned in cheese but remained relatively light with pinto beans, guac, and pico de gallo. Loved the corn! Prefer it chopped off the cob but flavors were spot on.  Owner came out to introduce himself and tell us about his new place. In addition to amazing aguas, he also does juices- gave us samples of the pineapple, the strawberry, chia, and spinach.  My next visit, I'm going to try to convince him to start bottling and selling his juices for home consumption- they were delicious and all-natural with no additives, and the guy is really knowledgeable about juicing and nutrition.  This place isn't what you expect- in a GOOD way! EDIT: Have since returned for many aguas frescas, tacos, and quesadillas. Some of the best fresh-Mex in Vegas. Consistently high quality, good portions and prices, always stellar service.",

That didn't phase us at first since me and my husband are pretty easygoing when we go out to eat. Maybe the lady had a bad shift, we surmised. Given our first visit here was good, we loomed forward to tasty food. Biting into cold nachis was an unpleasant surprise and tipped the scales. It was two orders of nachos, a diet coke, and one street corn, nothing complicated. Pretty sad considering our first visit was much better. I can think of better places to spend 20 bucks.

The shrimp quesadilla was amazing, honestly enough for just one, but my gf and I split it, while a tad bit greasy the grilled onions were amazing. The carne asada burrito was also great anddddd comes with guac what more do I need to say? It was good down to the tortilla. The tacos were very authentic in taste and a definite safe bet. Now for the nachos, they were indeed good, however I felt like they could have been better, perhaps the other meat options may have been a better choice, however overall still good. The rice and beans, definitely authentic, they had the home made taste. The aguas frescas were also good, mango was a tad thick almost like the Costco lagers mango, and the watermelon was fantastic, both great :)",

I was gladly not disappointed,  from the atmosphere to the customer service as soon as we walked in I couldn't decide between the taco or a quesadilla but since I was hungry I went for the quesadilla de pastor, and a mango agua fresca, and elote. As we are sitting at our table waiting for our food the young lady brings us 2 tacos of carne asada for free to try so yummy. And a sample of every agua fresca they had so above and beyond they have gained a loyal customer and am bringing my coworkers here to share in the food ecstasy.  Highly recommend this place for fresh, good priced Mexican food.",

    "text": "This place is a great example of Mexican with American influence done right.  Since no one else has seemed to talk about the lengua tacos (because most of you guys may be too scared or too fond of your carne asada fries), I decided to let all my fellow lengua lovers know that this place has AMAZING lengua tacos and the now three times that I've had them they never disappoint. It's hard to find good tacos de lengua, but thankfully I live fairly close to Frijoles so I can my lengua fix with no problem.  The staff is friendly and seems to be made up of mostly Latino/a descent workers and that always gives me a sense of relief because you know they're not gonna give you a sad excuse for Mexican food like Chipotle or Roberto's.  Aguas frescas are just as good as you would get at Cardenas, maybe even better because you can taste how fresh it is!  The \"Mexican street corn\" I like, but it's not very authentic. They put their own twist on it by charring the corn and what tastes like lime juice on it? I'm not sure, but it's still pretty tasty. Just don't expect to get the kind you'd buy from the elote man on the actual street. :)   Try this place guys, you won't be disappointed!",

You might as well have just stuck a straw in the fruit and drank away, sooo refreshing! Annnddd, I can't pass up a churro and I hope you don't either, personally the best I've ever had!

I love that everything has whole pinto beans instead of refried! Everything always is so fresh. Yummy!",
