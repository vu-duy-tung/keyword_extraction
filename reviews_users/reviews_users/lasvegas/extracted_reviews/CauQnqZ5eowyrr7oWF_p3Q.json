Ribs, chicken, brisket, hot links and rib tips. For sides we tried the coleslaw, yams, baked beans and green beans. Everything except for the green beans was outstanding. Green beans were nothing special. Delicious cornbread. The Mac n cheese looked yummy. Drawback, an hour wait in line, but totally worth it!!!!",

    "text": "So we made the trek to Road Kill, and it was pretty neat to see, but not much was spectacular.  The staff was, while polite, very impersonal.  Almost like they're trained to keep a distance. At least on the BBQ side.  The meats side sounded like they were a little more in tune with the customers.  Girlfriend had the tri-tip sandwich, which she said was very good. I had the three meat combo with brisket, pulled pork and hot link.  Sides were potato salad and baked beans.  Brisket- was cooked well, but didn't have a lot of flavor. It tasted like run of the mill roast beef.  Pulled pork - pretty good.  Again, cooked well, just didn't jump out as something special.  Hot link - easily the star of the show.  Wasn't really interested in it before I got there, but when I saw them, knew I had to try it, and I'm glad I did.  Hot, tender and juicy... And the spices were just amazing.  If the other meats would have had a bit of kick like this, wow...  Baked beans - couldn't figure out what was in them, but I don't really care...  They were awesome. Great flavor!  Potato salad - mehhh....  Tasted like it came from a food service pack.  Just another potato salad.  All in all, a fun place to visit, if for no other reason than to say we went.",

They close at 6pm and we got there at 5:45 pm and there was still a huge line.  OMG - it smelled SO good.  At around 6pm, they announced that they were out of ribs and it would take another 20 minutes and if anyone wanted to change their order, it was no problem.  For the people that waited, they gave use a ton of rib tips (seriously, they handed me a box of rib tips - AWESOME!!).  Since it was so late, I wasn't able to check out the meat market, but I know I'll be back.  Geez, I'm getting hungry just writing this... I ordered:   Three meat combo with:  Brisket Ribs Rib tips Mac & cheese Cornbread  One combo for two people and we still had leftovers the next day.  Normally a \"combo\" is one box/one meal.  We got three full size takeout boxes and a half box of rib tips (for waiting).  Everything was cooked perfectly.  I really liked their Mac & Cheese and we got two sides of it.  Ha! Their hot sauce is really good as well.  The HOT is pretty hot.  I normally love spicy, but I had to use the regular...    Ok, now I've gotta look on Yelp to see about a BBQ place near me for lunch.

Beans are so flavorful. Chicken had a perfect smokey flavor. They forgot my brisket so gave us a side order of brisket which was very generous. Ribs are delicious. Next time we'll order ahead the beef ribs but didn't want to wait 20 minutes today. Got the mild tangy sauce but nothing really needed it so used sparingly. Comfortable shaded picnic tables out back. Again, just as good as Austin and a perfect spot to take our out-of-towners.",

When the first 4 restaurants we tried blew our minds, we added days to our vacation to try a few more, including John Mull's.    So worth every bit of hype!!  Like many of the reviews state, this place is smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood.   Lots of rustic picnic tables, and a gravel/dirt drive way.  We happened to arrive right before the lunch rush - our service was prompt, our cashier was friendly and funny, and we got our food immediately after ordering.   I can see how this place might get super hectic/chaotic when busy - but it was well organized when we were there.    We ordered the 3 meat combo to share - and got the hot links, pulled pork, brisket and a double side of Mac.  All three meats were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.   The mac n cheese was super delicious, like homemade with melty cheese and awesome flavor.   Between the two of us, we had almost half of the food left when we tapped out.    This little gem is worth the drive outside of the city - for less than $20, we had an awesome, filling meal, and it definitely beat the flavor and quality of SoCal's (questionable...) favorite Phil's BBQ.",

    "text": "Some decent 'Que on my side of town!  I'll admit, I had to check out this place after it was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" on the Food Network.  But without this tidbit, I might have never knew the place existed!  Funniest thing about John Mull's is that it is basically located in the middle of residential homes.  Yes!  When you GPS the address you might think you're being led to the wrong place.  But keep truckin' because the BBQ joint is on property of what looks to be a ranch house.  John Mull's eating area shares the common space with what is essentially a butcher block.  Get a whole cow, some eggs, and then a meal of BBQ afterwards?  I don't see why not.  While the market has been around for some time, my review basically goes over the BBQ station.  It used to be just a shack when they first started, lately I hear they have a small food truck type deal to serve folks as well.  They need the help, John Mull's can get busy for lunch!  Typically it's take-out, but they do have a small seating area with about a dozen bench tables or so.  If it's full, eat it out of your truck tailgate like most folks do!  I am not an expert on BBQ by any means, but good food I can do.  Sure, you have your naysayers that go on and on and on about how their BBQ sauce is from a bottle (I can confirm I think it is), but really I don't care.  The meat itself is not artificially processed.  Trimmed in-house, and smoked in-house!  Flavor of the BBQ is what is necessary!  John Mull's makes some mighty decent 'Que.  Easiest thing on the menu to try if you're a noob to this place is just to go with a combo meal.  A 2 Meat Combo will run you about $14, and a 3 Meat Combo will run about $16.  When it's the wifey and I we usually opt for the 3 Meat Combo and share.  Be careful, it's a lot of food!  The 3 Meat Combo will easily feed a third person.    Combos come with your choice of meats and sides.  Meats include:  -Hot Link -Brisket -Ribs -Pulled Pork -Pulled Chicken -1/4 Chicken  Their strength lies in their ribs and brisket I think.  I like their pulled pork, but if I'm having their ribs (which I always do) I compliment it with the brisket.  The ribs are cooked just right, requisite pink ring around the outside, meat pulls off the bone (but not too easily), super moist and tender, finished on the grill with a slathering of BBQ sauce right before serving.  The brisket is flavorful, and just plain juicy, thanks to the lovely fat cap that surrounds each one before smoking.  OK, if you just say 'brisket' when you order your meat, you will most likely just get the lean end of the brisket.  Which is not dry, but not as near darn tasty as the fatty end.  So be specific on which part of brisket you want, lean or fat.  I will usually ask for a 1/2 portion of both.    For sides, Road Kill Grill has some options too:  -Potato or Macaroni Salad -Coleslaw -Baked Beans -Mac & Cheese -Green Beans  Unfortunately, no collard greens or black eyed peas!  But you can't have everything.  I will mention that the green beans are just mainly reheated from the can, so I mainly skip that.  The baked beans are very good, and their mac & cheese is actually pretty stellar.  I also enjoy their potato salad.  Combos and meals come with slices of white bread if you request, but don't forget to ask!  It won't always come with it included.  Also, get some extra BBQ sauce!  I know the sauce may be bottled, but they let it simmer on the side most of the day, so the flavor does concentrate nicely.  The hot BBQ sauce has a nice kick so watch out.  Kaboom!  It's overall great eats, just don't forget extra napkins and extra wet wipes!  It will get messy.  Which one of you city people eat BBQ with a knife and fork?  That's what the white bread is for!  Another item I usually order when we eat at Road Kill Grill is a sandwich.  They load these suckers nicely so you get a nice portion of meat and sauce to bread.  Basically a meal in itself!  I enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular.  This with extra hot BBQ sauce on top, and a side of coleslaw?  Classic.    BBQ can be a very picky topic, so you will see tons of varying reviews on John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill.  This is because depending on what side of the country you are from, you have a different taste of what BBQ should be.  Some like tomato based, some like vinegar based, some like mustard based, and so forth and so forth.  Some folks like more smoke, some folks like less smoke, Hell, some folks like their BBQ baked in an oven instead.  But no matter what, we all like good food.  And I think Road Kill Grill overall has good food.  Give them a try for yourself.  You might like, but then again you might NOT like.  Many reviews for this place are in the 3 or 4-star range, I tracked over to the 4-star area because I like it here.  In a place like Las Vegas it's difficult to find good 'Que that's not from a place like Famous Dave's or Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nuff' said.",

    "text": "Top notch meats, flavor was great! I had a pulled chicken sandwich, and that was really good to the point where you just wanna keep on biting into the flavorful sandwich without breathing! Lol I also had some baked beans and they were unlike any other beans I had had before, either A) I don't have them that often or B) they were interestingly good!    The reason for four stars instead of five was because I come from a family of hardcore grillers and when I tried a rib to see how it was in comparison... it wasn't. But hey the pulled chicken sandwich was killer and those beans  I also snagged a crum of corn bread and some macaroni salad and those were really good too.   If you have never been there I say go, it's a cool spot, not a place you're used to seeing everyday",

    "text": "I hadn't been by John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill in over a year and was craving some chicken, so I decoded to brave the lunch crowd for a cure. This place is in a residential neighborhood which surprises some, but I'm used to it from growing up in the neighborhood. I came here long before the Road Kill Grill opened when we would bring the deer my dad brought back from hunting each year here for processing. There is a decent sized dirt lot for parking, but just know that depending on the time of day you stop by might depend on you getting a spot or not. When I pulled into the lot this last visit, I was the only car and literally every single car that was behind me pulled in and there was no parking spots just that fast. That meant the line inside was going to get long fast, so I picked up my pace and headed in. I was greeted with a welcoming \"hello\" and then a girl came over and wrote down what I wanted. The guy behind the counter packed up my order and asked if I wanted any extra BBQ sauce. They have picnic tables in a couple areas outside if you want to eat out there or you can get your order to-go.   2 Meat Combo ($14.65) - I chose chicken and sliced hot links for the meats. All combos come with two sides and I chose baked beans and macaroni and cheese. For an additional $2.75 I also added a side of green beans. The chicken fell off the bone and had such a great taste! The chicken is worth coming here for alone and tasted just like I remembered. Chicken craving cured! I liked the sliced hot links, yum! I did like the BBQ sauce and liked that it was a sauce with actual flavor instead of just being overpowered by nasty vinegar. The macaroni and cheese here is hit or miss from what I have experienced and it's all about the texture that's different. There might be a time when the macaroni and cheese is creamy and oh so good and then there are times like my last visit where it's pasty and not so great. I enjoyed the baked beans however can do without whatever meat is in them. Bacon in the beans would be more what I'd prefer, but I have family and friends that love the baked beans just the way they are here. We all have our own tastes! The green beans were good and I liked the random pieces of pork mixed in. Oh yeah, you get to pick either a roll or corn bread to go with your meal. It's a lot of food and depending on your appetite it could easily be shared with someone. Just come by and try the chicken and thank me later :)",

I needed to get me meat on this last weekend and I've been searching for a good place to source some harder to find items; suffice it to say I think I may have found it. I have to agree with the previous reviewers - this place kicks meat's ass. They cut my order right there in front of me and wrapped it up nice and fresh. Granted - I could get it cheaper at a supermarket but honestly you get what you pay for.  The smoked bacon is very good, by the way and if you spend $40 you get free eggs!",

    "text": "Couldn't go to the original location so tried Road Kill Grill's second location at the CC Gun range during a recent visit to LV. he second location is a ways out there but worth the time and drive since we were visiting and really wanted to check it out. Three of us ordered a bunch of stuff so we could try it all out: chicken wings, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, beans, slaw and mac n cheese. Ribs were lean and meaty but a little dry, hot link was very good, pulled pork was plentiful and flavorful but a little dried out, chicken wings were tasty and meaty, but the brisket was underwhelming. Sides were all very good. Loved the beans and mac n cheese. Service was good.  Overall, the food was good but I wouldn't say great. Our impression was that it was due to it being a second location and probably not cooked on site. Might have dried out a bit on the trip from the original location. Definitely want to go to the main location and give it another try.",

Brisket was good, not great but good, pulled pork was very good. Baked beans WOW!!!!!  Wife had the hot link and brisket, hot links are amazing. Dining is outdoors, but clean and a great value for excellent BBQ.  If you want BBQ and are in Vegas you definitely need to make the short trip to Johns.  Saw it on Diners, Drive in's and Dive's and I was not disappointed.  Thanks to John and his staff for living up to the rep.",

To reward my effort, he usually takes me eating outside the strip and showing me the world is not just made of warcraft and gambling. This time, we were on a quest seeking THAT legendary BBQ in the hood (because we all know BBQ murlocs and gnomes are not edible)!!   This restaurant was definitely unique because it was hidden in the middle of a residential area. I would have never found this place if it wasn't for WoW bro. Apparently it wasn't that hard to find because Guy Fieri featured here on his Diners Drive-ins and Dives show.   The line wasn't super long but there was still a wait. They also had their merchandise on display to sell if you are a hardcore fan. They even branded their own water bottle.   Slave girl got 3 meat combo and I got beef rib dinner.   We picked brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs for our 3 meat combo. It came with 2 sides so we picked mac n cheese and baked beans. Oh man, everything was so freaking good. I liked the brisket the most, it was juicy and packed with smoky flavor.  For my beef rib dinner, we picked collard greens and chillies as our sides. That chillies was sooooo tasty I could probably eat 2 more cups by myself! After about 20 minutes wait, my name was called to pick up the beef rib. I got this huge foil tray and I was like, huh what did I just order? Omg, inside was one single beef rib and it was literally the same size as my hand! The meat was tasty and juicy, I actually finished the whole thing even though I was pretty full already.  WoW bro, you did it. This was the best BBQ ever and I don't think I can have any other BBQs anymore. If you are in Vegas, you have to check this place out.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I think it deserves 4 stars for the food and 3 stars for service. I think the quality and portion size for the price are fantastic. The super stars were the burnt ends, yams and Mac and Cheese. I ordered the 2 meat/2 side entree: burnt ends, pork ribs, Mac and cheese, yams. I also ordered the peach cobbler. I waited in line to order, the line was long but they had their system down and got the line moving quickly. The cashier was super friendly and bonus, they had complimentary cold water for everyone. I thought that was great, especially during summer.   I waited in the second line to get my meal. This line was short but took twice as long - even though the food was already prepared. The guys serving the food were nice but oh boy, they were slow and got almost my complete meal wrong. When they finally gave me the container I took a quick peek while waiting for the cobbler (which I had to remind him about)- they went to dip it up and realized they didn't have peach so they had to wait for the kitchen to bring it. When I peeked at my food I first noticed they had given me macaroni salad instead of Mac and cheese. Easy fix, he gave me a container of Mac and Cheese and told me to keep the macaroni salad. Great, thank you! Then one of the meats was covered by tin foil and I thought, better check that. So I saw brisket instead of ribs. Again, I told him and he gave me a side of ribs and told me to keep the brisket. Super nice that I basically got a one meat entree for free but it was a hassle asking for the corrections because they had already moved on to the next guest.   The cobbler finally arrives and I'm waiting, waiting, waiting after I see them give a few people behind me their cobbler. They see me standing there and still nothing. So I asked an employee walking by and he couldn't do it so he had to basically ask the same guy that had already seen me there waiting and knew why I was waiting.  Either they just had an off day (my husbands meal only had one mistake- cornbread instead of the requested white bread) or they need to drink some coffee and get with it!",

Only downside for me is not a fan of their sauce, but nothing a squirt of Sweet Baby Ray's can't fix. Outstanding food, reasonable prices. Just catered a family event from here and everyone LOVED the food. What's not to like?",

This place is so inefficient, it's business is by default since the closest butcher is 5 miles away. Coming here puts me in such a bad mood that I walked out and decided I'm done coming here.   The online butcher shops are a better option, inefficiency is why these smaller shops eventually lose to e-commerce, Iv been coming here for 2 years and Iv had enough.",

On the 4th they had free hamburgers, fries, and water to enjoy along with a live band.   The majority of the time I was under shade with a fan and cool water mister blowing on me.   Kyle, at the register was polite, cheerful, and quick with taking orders/our cash.   Angel is a whooot when taking your ticket and plating your order. Clarence keeps the kitchen staff in order and ensures the serving trays are replenished.   And the young gentlemen, sorry I didn't catch his name, at the hamburger grill kept tabs on how my mother was feeling in the heat (since she was not feeling well) as I stood in line.  All around from food to folks an amazing experience!",

Atmosphere - I really thought my phone app was taking me to wrong place.  We drive deeper and deeper into a residential neighborhood.  Yep very mixed residential, the business is the back behind a home.  Their neighbor across the street has three horses in the front yard.  Gotta love Nevada!  So how do I describe this place? It is like having a block party in some ones back yard.  Mix match of tables and chairs with picnic tables.  Food   Drinks - A can of Coke.    My Meal     Main Course - I want the tri-tip sandwich but they only serve that on Tuesday and Thursday.  I went with the rib tip dinner as my wife was going to eat two the sides which made for a better deal than the lunch.  So much meat!  It was so good, the smoke in the meat was fabulous       Dessert - I ordered an apple cobbler, I was not able to finish it as I too much of my lunch.  It was more a pie thrown into the bowl.  I love me some hot cinnamon apples so I did not care.  My wife shared hers, not by choice, with a bee.  She stopped eating it after that.  Service - So you get into a long line.  They take your order and you get your bill.  Then you pay your bill.  Then you take it to the serving station.  We had to wait for the rib tips as they had none at the serving station.  Then they forgot about us.  I was going to give then 3 stars for that portion but he gave us an extra apple cobbler.    Future - Awesome BBQ and would love to come back for that!",

I'll start with the good: I had beans and mac and cheese as sides. Both were stellar. Beans were nice and smokey and had some ground up meat in it. The mac and cheese was smooth and cheesy and very yummy.   The hot links were also tasty and I would get them again.   Now to the not so good: I also had brisket and burnt ends. The brisket was dry, grey, and tough. Missing was the smoke ring usually evident on smoked meats. There was also a slight flavor of refrigerator. Almost like the meat was from a prior day and reheated for the day I was here.   The burnt ends were served with a watery sauce that got all over my plate. I was expecting sticky and smokey but got watery and salty. These also did not taste fresh.   I would give this place another shot for sure based on the positive reviews of others, but I would avoid the brisket and burnt ends and try something else.",

Inside there is a cafeteria style line for your cooked order and also a butcher counter where you can pick up meats of all types.  This also can be ordered over the phone and by internet.    The cooked dinners are served in to go containers.  Dinners include a massive amount of meat and two sides.  As I love some soul food, I ordered collard greens and yams with my tender brisket.  YUM!   Secret menu item to be ordered about 1/2 day ahead: Smoked Beef Ribs.  As any lover of these knows, impossible to find on any menu.   There are picnic tables outside if you want to eat there.  It was 107 degrees the day we went so it all came home.    For 3 full dinners and some extra items we could not resist was $45.  Every dinner was enough for 2 meals.  Guy Fieri was there with his Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives show.  A very worthy location to choose.  We also asked to see the smokers which had some lovely chicken and beef cooking slowly for their guests.  Again, YUM!  Be prepared to wait in line but your faste buds will thank you!",

The cornbread is awesome and I love that they have a butcher in house to buy the bacon on the rind that I grew up eating. I'm also going to take home some center cut sirloin as well. Looking super forward to that!!!",

    "text": "Holy smokes I have died & gone to hog heaven, the BBQ is so good, no its HELLA GOOD!!!  My neighbor took my husband there for lunch yesterday and my husband came home w/ a container full of leftovers.  My husband was ranting & raving about how good the food was & how ginormous the portion sizes were, hence the sizable amount of leftovers.  I tried one bite of his hot links dipped in the mild BBQ sauce, which by the way had a really nice kick and is highly addictive & I was seriously hooked.  So hooked that I made him take me & my son out there this afternoon for lunch.  My husband prepped me about the place so I wasn't in shell shock about it literally being a \"Backyard BBQ\". You'll see what I mean when you get there but the food is so damn good you forget about the ambiance once you take a bite of their delicious tender BBQ.  We ordered the 3 meat combo plate, I picked the hot links, ribs & brisket and chose coleslaw & baked beans for my two sides, a brisket sandwich, a pulled chicken sandwich and 3 drinks.  Our total came to ~$36, which is super good for BBQ but the bonus is you get so much food that you have leftovers for later.  Honestly, the BBQ is so good it almost makes me not want to eat it so I can savor every piece but heck w/ the amount of food, you can dive right in & there will be plenty more on your plate.  We sat on the picnic tables and ate there this afternoon & I kid you not, every single person had containers of leftovers.  You get a lot of bang for your buck there.  Oh and two thumbs up to their awesome staff, just super friendly.",

I will say the line got a lot longer while we were waiting, but don't get discouraged, it is worth the wait! Every employee went out of their way to make sure everyone was having a great experience and making sure everyone was a happy customer. Very welcoming. My husband got a 3 meat combo and I got a two meat combo with high hopes of incredible leftovers. Between us both we got the hot links, brisket, ribs, pulled chicken and pulled pork. The Hot links were the favorite by far, but everything else was also delicious. The cole slaw was ok. I wasn't impressed with the beans. They were very onion-y and full of ground beef. Neither of us are onion fans. The mac and cheese was tasty, but I am a Wisconsin girl and used to the best cheese, so it is hard for me to be impressed with mac and cheese anywhere else. I guess you could call me a cheese snob. Had to throw in some Peach Cobbler too even though there was absolutely no room left after all that food. It was pretty good. We had such a great experience here, and cannot wait to return to get some more hot links and check out the butcher shop!",

Everything without exception was horrible. Not even one edible dish, and we sampled quite a bit. Imagine that my kids didn't even want to eat the Mac & Cheese. When your kids says no to Mac & Cheese you know its really bad. How can you screw up Mac and Cheese? Well these folk can and did. All the meats were dry beyond description. The sauces were terrible, the sides were just as bad as the meats. We moved from dish to dish, meat to meat and couldn't find a single item we wanted to take another bite of. The dessert cobblers (we samples 3 different ones  Apple, Peach and Cherry) were no better. There was enough sugar in them to give you a cavity just by looking at them, 2 of them were under baked so it was like getting a spoonful of raw flour /batter in your mouth, gross.  I wish I could find something good to say. My friend really spoke highly of it, and I see many other good reviews. Perhaps we caught them on a \"bad day\"? Should such an excuse even exist for food you paid almost $100 for? And how do you screw up every single thing on the menu? that goes far beyond just \"bad day\". I cannot speak of service, since we did takeout. If I have to try hard to find something good to say, its that the portions were generous. But if the food is all inedible, what difference does the portion size make anymore? $100 worth of food all went in the trash that day. Painful.",

I had the 2 meat with brisket and pulled pork with baked beans and Mac n cheese.  The highlights were the brisket and the baked beans.  The beans were not the common recipe and had some kind of meat and tasted like green peppers as well.  It was a nice flavor.  The brisket was fork tender and had a good flavor.  The pulled pork was good but not my favorite.  The meat had a strong smoke flavor. Perhaps smoked with mesquite or hickory, not sure exactly.

Did I mention that they have the best Mac & Cheese I have ever had in my whole entire existence?  Then there's those heaven made baked beans (ahhhhhh)! Yes! Yes! YES!!!!!!  This place is a must! Go there........ NOW!",

I got a 2 meat combo with brisket and pulled pork. Green beans and cole slaw for my sides. Also comes with choice of corn bread or white bread. . I went with the corn bread and it was really moist and good.  Green beans were a little salty and the brisket was only ok. Everything else I tried was excellent.  I tasted my brothers mac and cheese & baked beans, both were amazing!   Next time I got to try the ribs!",

She ended up taking me to the Road Kill Grill and I couldn't have been more pleased.  I asked a local for a recommendation and he said the rib tips.  I got that with the mac n cheese and baked beans....their sides are awesome.  We must have lucked out as the wait wasn't horrible...maybe 10-15 minutes.  The portions are large and food was excellent.  It's definitely worth a trip off the strip to hit up this spot.",

    "text": "Best BBQ ever!  I, like everyone else, discovered this hidden gem on Food Network. The next day I was there, and it has since become a favorite.   If you're going on Saturday, wear comfortable shoes. I have waited as long as an hour and a half. During the week, you should be in and out pretty quickly. The portions are insane! I am an eater, and a three meat combo lasts me about 3-4 meals.  Meats:  Brisket: I don't like brisket. I order brisket from Kill Grill every time. It's tender, juicy.. simply divine. A must.  Tri Tip: Better than the brisket. The only con is that they only have it twice a week. If they have it, get it.  Pulled Chicken: Pass on this one. I don't know what it is, but it just isn't good.  Pulled Pork: It's good, but not my favorite. Don't get me wrong - compared to other places it's awesome, but they have better options in my opinion.  Sausage: A favorite. I usually get them cut up and drenched in sauce. They're a little bit spicy, but they're packed with flavor.  Ribs: Great flavor and extremely tender and juicy. You literally won't want sauce.  Sides:  I won't go into great detail, but I have tried the beans, macaroni salad and mac and cheese. They are all pretty tasty, but the mac and cheese is probably the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. It's a must!  Cobbler:  I've tried all three flavors - the cherry is really sweet. I prefer the apple.  For the amount of food you get, the prices are extremely reasonable. When they're really busy the service can sometimes be lacking, but they try. They usually will pass out free water if you've been standing for awhile. This is definitely one of my favorite places to dine in Vegas. Go now.",

We just happened to be in the area and I was not a fan of Vegas BBQ mainly because I didn't see beyond the chain restaurants (not a fan).  The place looks like someone's back yard and smells of smoke, wood, and Meat. You walk in and the lines are long and there is a bit of a wait. So worth it! Everyone was very friendly, cracked jokes, laughed, and made everyone feels at home.  We had the yams - delightful, collard greens - amazing, Mac-n-cheese - made me dance, macaroni salad - pretty good, sausage - WTH, rib tips - TASTY, ribs - phenomenal!!! I see more trips there in my immediate future. I can't wait to take my family when they visit.  I absolutely love it.",

I live about 559 miles away and it's a nine hour drive however it's worth it when I go to Las Vegas and I don't miss the opportunity.  This trip it was wintertime (January 19th) and although the wind was blowing and the temperature was rather chilly the Road Kill Grill had lighted heaters on the patio with covered seating and it was really toasty and comfortable.  The food is outstanding and both times this trip I had hot links, ribs and tri-tip with chili new on the menu as a side along with coleslaw and mac & cheese (not new, but excellent).  It's all terrific. The food is outstanding however it's the staff that makes you feel welcome and one of the family that puts the frosting on the cake (by the way the cornbread is wonderful and could actually be cake it's so good).  The people greeting you outside if there is a line, the cashier, the entire place is alive and fun to enjoy.  Each time even though it may be different staffers there it's always a fun time.  Thank you Road Kill Grill for the best time ever.",

I ordered the tri tip, ribs , pulled pork , chicken and a couple sides. I was expecting fall off the bone quality ribs with tons of flavor but what I got was a dry rib that wasn't good at all.

Normally at other BBQ joints we really either like the sides or the BBQ but never both. Wasn't the case at John Mull's...every aspect of the meals were fantastic. I am pretty sure we tasted every meat available in their combo plates. Between 4 of us we picked up 7 combo meals and ate for the whole weekend. Even when we felt full, it was still the best BBQ. Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potatoes, pulled pork, brisket, ribs, omg every single thing was amazing.   We arrived right when they opened and there was already a line so get there early. They also have a butcher shop for all your other meat needs, which opens earlier than the cooked food side.",

The staff was super friendly they gave out free waters. While we waited. Because they were about to close we got the last of the rib tips,  ribs & Mac and cheese etc. everything still tasted great. But not as fresh as I would like. For instance the potato salad I prefer to eat cold which I hope the second time we go, it will be if not I'll pass . The corn bread was so good I could eat a dozen of those. Also bonus if you are taking your meal To go there is a bag station where you can grab fork napkins and You could take extra bbq sauce mild or hot I personally love the mild sauce.  I almost don't want to critique on the freshness of the food or the quality considering we were one of the last customers. We look forward to our next trip , So to be continued..",

For three of us; we dropped $52 for lunch, so it's also pricey.  The hot link (got  it sliced) it was very good the burnt ends were very very tender. The cornbread is a special shape; it's very sweet and it's top notch; almost a dessert bread.  Typically we wait outside in line for between 10 and 45 minutes. You enter through the large heavy door into the stations where they fill your order. Then as you pass through you'll notice (on the right) you can buy eggs and various meat cutter products. I'd recommend trying there spicy BBQ sauce don't forget to grab a couple of waters and head outside and enjoy your barbecue. Some days they also have a food serving trailer which cuts down on the lines. It would be nice if there was a draft beer or two option to be ordered (as beer would really go well with this barbecue), but I understand that you are allowed to bring your own.  Watch the hours that they're open before you go and if you can't get there to the location on Thom, don't forget they have a location at the shotgun /archery section of the Clark County Shooting Complex.",

    "text": "So let's just say I'm a huge fan . I saw this place on food network a few times last week and decided I had to come try it out ... I was able to see and talk to chuck plus I got delicious burnt ends and macaroni salad and the delicious Mac and cheese . The pulled pork and BBQ sauces are epic .. Most of all everyone I've encountered there is Always friendly and man oh man do they stay busy so I think that says a lot .  Our family favorites are the pulled pork and Mac and cheese like I said but I've gotta say I really enjoyed the burnt ends too..  This place only has outside seating but for the price you get awesome portions and a country vibe and delicious eats ..  Plus I am a little partial to this place since it's one of the few places my son will eat the food and ask for seconds",

    "text": "I'm not a big fan of BBQ because people don't know how to make good BBQ anymore. I have to say this place was pretty good though. You have a choice of bbq sauce and I happen to go with the spicy bbq sauce, only because I wouldn't have it any other way. I opted for the 3 meat plate. My choice of meats were the hot links, brisket and rib tips... I have to say I made a great choice. The brisket and rib tips were very tasty, tender and delicious. The hot link was just the right amount of spicy for me. I also went with the collard greens, which I love and found it very difficult to find tasty greens anywhere in town but this place restored my faith in good tasty collard greens again. . The Mac and cheese was a bit dry to my taste buds though. I also added an extra side of green beans which had potatoes with it, just like I make them at home... delicious. For dessert  I went with the peach cobbler.... again not to my liking. Just called me spoiled, once you've had a great peach cobbler it is very hard to find something up to par. It was tasty but just not sweet enough for me. Overall it was a good and I'd love to go back !",

My fiance and I came in here the other day and waited 30-40 minutes and while we were waiting I noticed a huge layer of fuzz/dust in EVERY vent on the ceiling. I was so grossed out I decided not to order any food. There was grease and dirt caked up on the fridge door on the left when you walked in and behind the wall hangings. The walls were dirty, overall not a good feeling when you go in. I really hope one of the owners read this because at this rate people will get sick eating there.",

    "text": "Finally made it a priority when visiting sin city. For so long had this place bookmarked and realized Sundays the place is closed. Luckily the wait was not too bad or so I assume as I've seen videos of how busy this place gets.   The atmosphere of a ranch style picnic area for dinning gives a unique experience from any bbq joint i've visited. Although it was a chili afternoon the heaters kept us warm as we eat our dinner.   Everything was of my enjoyment, however the ribs and the cornbread are what really will get me to come back. The mac n cheese was good although I would have enjoyed a much more cheesy version as this one was more on a creamy side. After ordering I asked for two extra rib pieces and surprisingly I was not charged for those extra pieces. The staff here is very polite and friendly from the moment you walk on the premises. I will definitely be coming back when I am back in Vegas.",

Standing in line and then walking through a very small and cramped kitchen/office/prep area to pick up my food wasn't pleasant and it didn't seem very sanitary with that many people coming in and out. A large number of customers were stuffed into the pick up line and employees served up our orders in styrofoam containers. We added bbq sauce, drinks, paid, and went outside to find a seat. I ordered a two meat combo of brisket and rib tips with mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides. Thank goodness we ordered sides of cornbread because it was as sweet as birthday cake and sadly the highlight of my meal. Dare I say that I enjoy Famous Dave's a lot more than I did John's.",

We decided to go since we had family in town who wanted to go here as well.  -Chicken soggy bland and seemed like it was sitting out a while  - hot links (I'm indifferent. I tried it but it was drowned in sauce.   - brisket 0 stars. Dry dry dry.   - pork ribs - these were my favorite of all the meats, tender and flavorful but not the best pork ribs I've ever had.  -rib tips - very dry  - beef rib (this was the only meat they actually grilled and brought to us) and it was not as tender as I had hoped for and was drowned in BBQ sauce. It was ok nothing I would want to come back for.  My favorite part of the meal was the Mac n cheese, collard greens, yams, and cornbread.   The other sides we got mac salad and green beans were nothing special.   One thing I noticed is that all the meat is sitting already cooked and sliced and in metal containers/warmers. I'm no expert but I believe that's what is causing the drying out of the meats.  Unfortunately they fell short for me and I am back to my regular spot.",

Was rather disappointed after all i had heard about their bbq. My rib was tough and i found vey little meat on it. The rib tasted more like it had been  steamed vs actually cooked on the grill. I and my friend are from Texas and this just seemed to be sub par at the best. The brisket was ok but I have had better. My friends ribs were also tough and chewy. Just was not worth the money that was spent. Ribs should be falling off the bones, i should not have to wrestle it off the bone. On the plus side i ordered a brisket to cook for New years and it was great and value was awesome!!!",

We loved the beans, mac & cheese, corn bread, pulled pork and potato salad. The pulled chicken was a little too heavy on the sauce and the ribs weren't as tender as we like.

It all about the FOOD!!! We had hot links with collar greens (the best I had in years!) and mac and cheese. Not sure what's in the Mac but it's really good! We will most certainly return.",

Seriously, try everything you won't be disappointed. I love the hot links, pulled pork, all of the sides are bomb. They have all of the comforts of barbecue perfectly done right. Flavorful, fresh, and straight to the point. They also have free hot dogs and hamburgers some days for those long waits! If I can wait here in 110+ degree weather for this deliciousness, so can you!

We walked inside and were rudely told to go wait outside while the woman took the order of the group who came in AFTER us. There was another group waiting outside with us. They were just as confused as we were. After standing outside waiting for about 10 minutes with no sign of the order taker, my husband went in to see if they were ready for us, she yelled at him to get back outside. Again, no one ever came to take our order or invite us in after the line died down. We finally just went in anyway and she eventually took our order.   After finally placing our order slooooowly getting to the cashier, the employees started yelling at each other because too many customers were coming in from outside. The lady behind us nicely tried to explain our confusion and offer help to get people to wait outside like (apparently) they're supposed to. The cashier started SCREAMING at the poor lady! We had just paid or I would have walked out.   We had planned on putting in a meat market order but couldn't wait to get the hell outta there!  Got home and they forgot one of our sides. Food was ok but not worth the hassle at all. There are much better BBQ joints with nice employees to help you.",

Positives: Mac N Cheese is the best in our solar system. If that is all you get from there you will be pleased. They offer briskett, pork, chicken-pulled/quarters, links.  There cold sides are sort of commercial- nothing special though. The cobbler is BOMB as well. You can call in your order but it still takes a bit to get it.

It wasn't very busy and we basically were ignored while we tried to figure out where to order, how to find utensils, etc. We never found the barbeque sauce either which might have also improved the rating.    On to the food, we split a three meat combo with brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with the cornbread, baked beans and potato salad. We ate there at the covered tables near the misters and even at 3 pm and 100 degrees, it really was very bearable to eat.  The ribs were well flavored but only one was super tasty, tender. That one definitely earned rave reviews. The brisket was tender and meaty but no real smoke or barbeque seasoning. Maybe sauce would have changed our minds but least favorite item on the plate.  The pulled pork was great, small amount of sauce mixed in and was tender and flavorful. As for the sides, cornbread was good, slight sweet; potato salad was mild and creamy and tasted good, best side however was the beans, slightly sweet with good amount of sauce and meat.   The food is good enough for us to go back again but would love to see a bit more friendly atmosphere.",

I heard they were pretty popular cause they were featured on a food network show, so it means they have to be good right?  Well after waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes to place my order I didn't know what to get so I ordered 1 of every meat. I have to say they offered a pretty big selection of bbq meats, pulled chicken, pulled pork, rib tips, pork ribs, brisket, and hot links. Unfortunately none of it really stood out. I might be crazy but while waiting in line, people who received their food were yelling about how good this was and I dont know what they are talking about. I guess I'm spoiled to have had Franklin's in Austin, Tx multiple times, but this doesn't even come close and not worth the 40 minute wait.   BBQ meats aside, this place makes, hands down, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. I don't know what they do but it was sent from the gods. I'll probably go back for the Mac and Cheese, but for BBQ there's only 1 place in Vegas that reigns supreme.",

    "text": "Well, we came here for lunch on a Tuesday. As we pulled into the gravel parking lot it brought me back to the time I went to the Salt Lick in Texas. If you get lpst, just follow your nose. You can smell the delicious meats smoking.   We had my friend's dad order for us. They have been coming here before they were a restaurant. I trusted his judgment. He ended up just ordering three 3 meat combos that we shared family style at one of their picnic tables. He ordered brisket,  hot links, and ribs. I tend to stick to my favorite kind of BBQ which was the brisket.  I also tried the hot links which I will also get the next time we go there. The sides we had were the mac & cheese, baked beans, cole slaw, and the macaroni salad.   First of all, the brisket was so tasty and tender. The hot links weren't too spicy. I like the snap it had when I bit it. I preferred the spicy BBQ sauce instead of their original. It isn't too spicy, but it does give you a little kick heat which went well with the food.   I guess I'm a creature of habit and only tried the mac & cheese and bread. Both of which I devoured. I put the brisket and hot link in the bread and made a little sandwich of BBQ heaven.  I don't regret that I didn't try the other sides because I was completely content with what I ate.   I will definitely be back. It was well worth the drive over to the other side of town from where I live.   Okay, well I do have one regret. I didn't take any pictures of the food because I was so hungry. Haha",

    "text": "While it can be hard to find good BBQ in Vegas, this spot is always a sure bet for good BBQ.  It has all of the meat selection that you would see at a typical BBQ joint; ribs, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, hot link sausages, and chicken, among others. They also have a lot of the standard sides that would be at this type of place; cole slaw, mac and cheese, baked beans, potato salad, mac salad.   I mostly get the ribs, brisket, mac and cheese, and cole slaw. The ribs are always meaty, seasoned well, and juicy. The mac and cheese doesn't taste like it is made with velveta or some other processed cheese. You can taste the cheddar and it is both stringy, creamy, and exceptionally good. The cole slaw isn't overly sweet and it has a nice non-overpowering peppery taste to it. While I don't always get it, one of their cups of peach, apple, or cherry cobbler is a good ending to a good meal. Their cobbler selection isn't out of this world like you would get from a cafe or bakery, but it is coming from a BBQ joint and it does it's job of rounding out a good meal.  It doesn't matter if you get the single item dinner meals or the 2-3 meat combo dinners, they always load you up with your selected meats and sides. I almost always get their food when the grill opens up at 11:00 am, and I will stay full for the rest of the day.  My only minor grip is that their brisket is pre-sliced super thin and sitting in a juice/broth bath which makes it dry sometimes.  The word is out on this fine establishment, so expect a line when you get there almost any time of the day. Even with the line you will not be disappointed, and you will be looking forward to going back again for some more awesome food.",

    "text": "This is a review for just the Road Kill Grill - not the butcher.  I assume Road Kill Grill should have its own listing but since everyone is posting here about it, I might as well do it too.  So - I read the story on John Curtas's site that Road Kill Grill never existed until DDD made it up for good television.  I'm confused as to why that would happen, but I think it's interesting.  Since I've had to be on the North - NW side of town lately I thought I would jet over and try it.  I wasn't mostly very impressed with anything I tried, the ribs were dry and the sides were forgettable and I ended up throwing all that stuff away after a few bites.  I also want to point out that there is literally not a vegetable based side on the menu.  However, I had the chicken and it was heavenly.  I will come back just for this.  It had a dry rub, and the BBQ sauce was in a self serve area on the side, which I got a little to taste and was fine.  But I prefer a more vinegar based sauce because regular sauce has too much sugar.  I did like being able to control whatever sauce I wanted to put on it, as I mostly opted to not have any at all.  So while I can honestly say there's no good BBQ in town, I really did love the chicken here more than others I have tried.  This includes Famous Dave's, Lucilles, Buzz, Memphis, etc.  I get cravings for it, and I wish they would sell it ala carte on the menu without all those sides.",

You order, then keep moving through the line to get your food. When it was our turn to get our food they were out of pulled pork and said it would be about 15 minutes. I was kind of tired of waiting so I asked if they could just double the brisket and they were happy to do so. I did notice that after we were done and leaving, the people behind us in line were still waiting for their pork. The hubby and I shared the 3 meat combo, but ended up with just the brisket and rib tips. Both were great. The baked beans were AMAZING and the coleslaw was just ok. It was more than enough food for the two of us. The only bummer here was the line.",

    "text": "A friend told me to try it after she saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives.  My husband and I thought our navigation system was taking us to the wrong location because we went through a residential neighborhood.  But there it was set back across a gravel parking lot.  The food was good.  We tried the ribs, pulled chicken, links, and brisket.  We chose bbq beans,  green beans seasoned with turkey & potatoes, macaroni & cheese,  The mac & cheese was slightly creamy and seasoned well.  The bbq beans were delicious and had ground meat seasoning.  The brisket was our favorite when dipped in either of their tasty sauces.  The hot links had a smooth flavor with a kick.  The line was quite long when we arrived as it was a half hour before closing.  The building has these meat locker doors and some people aren't smart enough to not stand close to the door because other patrons will be opening the door behind them.  We almost took out this lady and her kid, and she was upset with us because we couldn't see through the big steel door and see her on the other side.  They were out of desserts so we didn't get to try their cobblers.  Drawback is there is no indoor seating to enjoy your food.  Since we are visiting from out of town, we took our food to a hotel because we couldn't take the outdoor seating where it was 106 degrees in the shade.  They did have misters, but that wasn't enough.",

My family and I went on a Saturday, they were pretty busy so expect to wait in line for about a half hour to 45 minutes, normally that would be a deal breaker but we ended up waiting and we are so happy we did! The food was amazing. From the ribs to the baked beans and everything in between. We pretty much tried most of what was on the menu ( it's a small menu) we loved everything but the peach cobbler. It wasn't great.  They also have a market where you can buy their meat. We are definitely making this place our go to for bbq!",

    "text": "Please read below to see my first post regarding Service, not food quality (which has always been awesome and never in question!) I'm updating this review because it's the right thing to do and, hopefully, people will take it to heart and follow suit when necessary.  The once horrible experience detailed previously was pretty much completely erased from my memory banks thanks to Ms. Bianca at John Mulls. Not only did she personally reach out to apologize to me; she offered to re-cater another event for my office, free of charge. My faith in humanity sometimes wanes, but people like Ms. Bianca remind me there is still hope. When a business owner recognizes problems, acknowledges and accepts responsibility for their mistakes, and takes steps to correct them; well, let's just say it's a beautiful thing! I've been a big fan for a long time. Now I'm so impressed, I don't know what to say other than thanks!  Service is everything to me. I can look past a lot of minor inconveniences if the service is great but, my recent experience here was less than acceptable. I've been a big fan of this place for along time, even before the Road Kill Grill was conceived of, so keep that in mind.  If you order food a week in advance, and show up a bit earlier than you are scheduled; you would think the food would be out pronto. I had a group of 60 people waiting for me to return with our Christmas luncheon food. I was told to arrive at 10:15 ( which I did). You have to wait outside by the grills when you get your orders here. When I went out, there were about 5 groups of people waiting for their food. One guy ordered food for 200 people! A very rotund and rude woman arrived 30 minutes later; she too had ordered food for 200 people. Talk about getting in over your head on the catering orders! I waited for an hour and 40 minutes outside, standing in the cold, while one person attempted to handle the packaging of the orders, one person at time. I asked someone to get the order for an elderly lady standing next to me waiting for two pans of pulled pork. The big guy running the grill heard me and got her stuff or she would have been waiting for over two hours! You wouldn't believe the behavior of some of the people (who were rightly upset due to the long wait time) trying to cut into line ahead of others and using foul language, none of which was being addressed by the staff of John Mull's. A pity. I will never order a catered event from them again and recommend you look elsewhere, unless you don't mind standing around for a couple of hours while your guests wonder if they are at the right party.",

Until today and I have to say it's a love/hate thing going on.   Love- Food was excellent, there were 4 of us and we decided to all get 3 way combos so we could sample all the meats, and it was all VERY GOOD, great flavor and very generous servings (go Ritchie! ), sides were off the hook and don't even get me started on their cornbread!  I've had good and bad BBQ all over the country and this place holds its own with the best, hands down!!!  Staff was very friendly and when you finaly make it inside, they only let 5 orders in at a time, there's  Ritchie dishin it up, huge portions and a great attitude, he was great, made the long wait enjoyable. Larry was also very accommodating, and Chuck was the chill guy at the register. Oh, btw, prices I think on the low side for what you get...   Hate- the fact that it took me this long to get there...   A MUST GO TO SPOT WHEN IN VEGAS!",

It takes us 20 minutes to get to this place and unfortunately we didn't realize that the order was incredibly wrong until we got home and by then they had closed for the night.

It's hidden away in a residential neighborhood and the grill itself is located in a little butcher shop. Bascially the butcher shop set up a little cafeteria-style barbeque service where you go through the line and they scoop what you want into little styrofoam take out boxes and you go outside and eat at little pinic tables. I was skeptical at first, but boy I was definitely glad I went out of my way to try this place.   They have a variety of BBQ fare ready to order like: hot links, brisket, ribs, pulled pork/chicked which can be served with a side of baked beans, mac & cheese or potato salad just to name a few. Everything was really delicious and packed all the flavors of what awesome BBQ should be.   The hot links were featured on the show and now I know why! They're made fresh in the shop and have the perfect amount of spice. And I can not tell you enough how good the baked beans are! I must have licked my plate clean!  Bad thing is that you have to eat outside in the Vegas heat. However, they have fans set up with misters, which helps somewhat. Or you can take your order to go and enjoy in the comfort of your own home. I'll be back, that's for sure.",

    "text": "John Mull's Meats is the premier butcher shop in Las Vegas. My family has been buying meat from John Mull's for over 40 years and the quality and customer service have always been top-notch. Chuck Frommer is a 2nd generation butcher and owner following his father and an uncle keeping the shop as a family run business since 1955. This certainly speaks to the consistent product quality John Mull's turns out. Chuck is on the premises everyday working in the shop as is his wife, making sure their customers are getting the best of service.      A lot of folks are gun-shy when it comes to purchasing meat from a butcher shop as opposed to the grocery store because they think the prices are going to be substantially higher. This is not the case at John Mull's. The prices at Mull's are very competitive with those at the supermarket and the quality of the meat and poultry is head and shoulders above the grocery stores meat. Checkout their website and you can compare the prices to what you find at your neighborhood store. John Mull's is also a game processing facility where hunters have been bringing their deer, turkey and wild boar to be butcher for decades.    John Mull's is also home to the Roadkill Grill which was recently featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. That's another review I'll be doing but this does give you the opportunity to try John Mull's meats as a finished product so you can immediately taste the quality of their cuts.",

Then she looked at me like I was suppose to say something to the people even though she messed up.

Employees were so kind and very funny! I would recommend it to anyone who lives or visits the Las Vegas area! Totally worth the drive off the strip !",

The food is killer and the atmosphere is perfect for barbecue; the place feels outdoorsy and has tremendous personality. Coming from a chef and restaurant manager, the behind the scenes is super clean and professionally run. (We got the tour because restaurant people bad together.) I loved that they broke down entire carcasses to make the pulled pork and brisket. Totally legit.  Richie and Chuck were the highlights of our visit. Richie was hilarious and friendly as hell, love seeing a fellow New Yorker around. Chuck struck up conversation quick and definitely made you feel at home. Anyone visiting Vegas must make the trip out to this place. I promise you won't regret it.",

It was our first time here and the employees were very  helpful and nice. I ordered the half chicken dinner with Mac and cheese and greens. When I got home I realized they don't put sauce on the chicken but after eating it I really didn't miss the sauce. The greens were good, I liked that they were cooked with smoked turkey since I don't eat beef or pork. The mac and cheese and cornbread was also decent. My husband ordered the link/rib combo with macaroni salad and baked beans. He didn't care for the links something about the taste but he did like the ribs. He also enjoyed the beans but said they were a little on the spicy side. Overall we enjoyed our food and will visit again since it's not too far from home. Oh the peach cobbler had a good taste but unfortunately my container had a lot of burnt crust in it.",

I tried the ribs tips  which were great, the brisket which was very tender, just wish it had a bit more smokey taste and I had the pulled pork.  The pork was good but would probably stick with the other two in the future cause even though the pork was good, it wasn't my favorite.  As far as sides I tried the macaroni salad which I though was no better then store bought.  The Mac and cheese which was good.  However I tried two other sides which I thought were the stars of the sides.  They were the yams and collar greens.  I must admit they were fantastic.  The corn bread was like a desert and very sweet.  As I do cook myself I think I would tune down the sweetness a bit and put real corn into the mix to give it more of a country flavor and texture.  I would definitely go back to this restaurant.  The only thing I think that I can complain about would be the outside seating.  Granted it's part of its great atmosphere but the flies were attacking from all sides and there misters were on so high that it felt like I was getting hosed down.  Great food though a must try",

Better I say, better than tex by far and Memphis by long shot.like meat butter.  have to eat outside in the yard of a neighborhood house. Crazy stuff. good place for a ride too lunch.  BYOB.... Mac n cheese was great also along with meaty baked beans--killer! was $17 for 3 meat combo and I hadn't eaten yet and could only scarf down bout half....just couldn't stop eaten....so good.  sucks hrs are 1100-1800 for cooked food.  other than that they every conceivable meat product for sale from pigs ass to rabbits foot.  meats are a little on the high side but custom butchers are. great catering prices. I will use them for event soon.  deserve 6 of 5 stars. Thanks John.",

Everything was very good and the portions were appropriately sized. The only real complaint is that the workers did not have any sense of emotions and they were very silent and did not crack a smile. There is no seating as the building is set up where on building you order and then a little outdoor area which is only for seating and it has wood benches along with mist sprayers for those hot days. I would highly recommend this place as the food is very good.This place while being on TV, I feel that the quality has gone down as the customers got bigger. The food is good but the quality of BBQ and food does not compare with a comparable SNS Diner.",

Like bring me a straight jacket with my meal cuz I'm crazy about their food. We went on a tues, it was tri tip day and i really can't say oh my god enough. It was so flavorful and the pulled pork was perfect. I honestly can say this place ruined every other place that serves meat for me because it will never be as good as the road kill grill. You also get two sides with your meal, I opted for the green beans with pork and a potato ball in the middle (bomb as shizz) and the Mac n cheese (supa cheesy). I am not a crazy big foodie but I know good food when I eat it and this place is on point, the cats meow and every other snappy way to say EAT HERE ITS AMAZING .   The people that work here are also really nice have good customer service and they talked to us about football which was really cool. You can also get meat(goat, deer, cow, rabbit) here, eggs, cheese and probably a bunch of other amazing things that I haven't even scratched the surface of. Ohhhhh they also do jerky and as a very big fan of jerky that right there just makes me fall in love with them even more. Me and my boyfriend could not stop eating even though we were full to the brim.   If you find yourself on that side of town (which I never do anymore) you have to try this place it's everything every place that sells meat wishes they were. And the prices are so reasonable $14 for two meats two sides and a roll and they do not skimp on their portions not by a long shot. I have fallen hard and madly in love with this place it's like if angels were in the meat business :) it's truly that good. 10/10 cuz 5/5 is just insulting.",

I always get 3 meat combo with 2 sides I can't go wrong with that. Sides are amazing. Meats tender with great flavor. I need to leave room for dessert one day and try it I bet that's delicious also. It's always worth the wait no matter how big the line gets. And they have waters for you while you wait that was another great thing. I will not eat the whole day when I know I'm going to eat here and it never disappoints. Thank You Road Kill Great Job Everyone",

    "text": "OUT OF TOWN FOLKS BEWARE!  So the wife and I are not from the Vegas area but heard this place was a good place to go get some BBQ. All we got was sliced brisket and peach cobbler.  1. You can't buy per pound, it's a side of brisket. So we got two sides. Thinly sliced just like chain restaurants always do.  2. Holy crap beanie wienies. My wife and I took one bite of the brisket, looked at each other and at the same freaking time said beanie wienies. If you like beans, and hot dogs, without there actually being beans and hot dogs on your beef brisket then this is perfect for you! 3. Very in-personable. They have you pay, the you get in another line waiting to give your ticket of what you purchased and you get called up when it's ready. So for those of you gen Z people that don't like human interaction will lives this.  4. Like I said, you look at a menu, you pay, get in another line waiting for your food and you walk by all the sides and other meats waiting to give your ticket to the food gatherers. So, if you see a meat or side that looks good or you want some more beanie wienie brisket, ITS TOO LATE, YOU'VE ALREADY PAID.  Seriously people, it's Las Vegas, if you want BBQ, go further east.",

I know I wanted the ribs but was unsure of my second meat so I asked the lady who works there for advice.  She told me to have the burnt ends but I would have to wait for them to be ready.  I agreed and it was definitely worth the wait.  The ribs were good but no comparison to the juicy tasty burnt ends.  After I order I was walking out to eat but I saw one of the guys doing the bbqing so I asked him if he would show me his Bbq pits.  He stopped what he was doing and said \"sure come on out back with me.\"  I started asking him questions because I love to Bbq and before you know it he opened up one of the pits with pork shoulder and pulls one out grabs a knife and cuts a piece off and says try this.  Wow it was so good,  next we went over to the tri tips and once again he cuts me off an end piece and let me taste right off the grill.  He answered several questions and gave me some great Bbq tips to try at home.  I told him thanks.... That made my day in Vegas!!!  Coolest guys and I definitely know it was worth the drive out to their place.  I'll be back for sure.",

So I returned in the afternoon the following day for an early dinner.  I got the 3 meat plate.  Hate to say this but I wasn't impressed!  The only 2 things I thought were good were the mild BBQ sauce & their Mac & Cheese.  The ribs were dry & not something I'd ever get again.  Pulled pork was okay but I don't like when they sauce up pulled pork.  The brisket was like a dry flavorless roast beef.  The portions were good size but not really a bonus in a situation like this.  The place felt like I was in the Deep South and not some random residential neighborhood in Vegas like it is so that was retro.",

The meat selection Baby Back ribs overcooked and cold (cardinal sin for BBQ) Brisket was thinly sliced, cold and dry (BBQ master needs to go back to school on slicing). 2 Sides Potato Salad felt like I was back in Oklahoma (Excellent) BBQ Bake Beans- good flavor Cornbread - moist, butter and sweet (this coming from someone doesn't like Cornbread). Good job 3 Staff Friendly and helpful. Overall it's all about the Meat!!!",

If it wasn't for food network and yelp I would never have known about this place. Hiding on a little street between rancher homes you might pass this place up.   I had the 2 meat combo. I chose the brisket and pulled pork. That brisket was so tender and juicy. The pulled pork sauce had just a little kick to it and I loved it. For the sides I chose mac and cheese and coleslaw. The cheese is flavorful and the noodles were cooked just right. The coleslaw is just a little sweet. I like my slaw sweet but having the way road kill does it was nice too. The portions are generous! I thought I could eat everything but half way through my stomach was like no more, so I got some left overs for tomorrow.  I will have to buy some meat from the shop to cook at home next time. They have covered wood tables outside for you to dine at. If it's to windy or cold then that's ok take your food and go home it will still be nice and warm. This place easily has lines. I lucked out today and the line was not too bad.  I give Road Kill Grill 4 stars for the excellent BBQ that's super tender and for the friendly service!",

    "text": "This has definitely been on my Vegas Eats bucketlist for quite some time. The reviews have always been great, but it's a long ways from my Henderson digs, so I hadn't had a chance to test out some Road Kill Grill. Good grief was it worth the wait.   Rather than enjoy the best BBQ in Vegas alone I decided to bring an entourage. It was just before the Christmas holiday so I grabbed all of my closest co-workers to enjoy a fun holiday lunch with one another. I'm pretty sure between the entire group of 6 we ordered the entire menu. Personally, I went with a 3 meat combo that included ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. For my sides I went with a double load of mac n' cheese. That was an excellent choice as their M&C was off the hook. The ribs had fantastic flavor. I do like them to fall off the bone a little more, but they weren't tough at all. The pulled pork was the best I've ever had and they give you a mountain sized portion. The chicken was my least favorite as it had a little bit of a gassy flavor. I think it might have been a bit of smoke overload, though it was incredibly tender. Next time I would probably drop the chicken and go with the brisket or a hot link since those looked so good. The icing on the cake was the corn bread you got with it. Sweet and the perfect complement to a great meal. The 3 meat combo was literally enough food to feed 3 people, so be advised that you will likely have leftovers if you go this route.  The seating area is very informal. Picnic style which is great for a large group. Only warning I would give is that it's all outdoor seating, so weather could be a factor. They do have heaters that keep it relatively warm on a cold day.   I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill. Next time I'm definitely planning on visiting the butcher shop to load up my freezer. Great stuff!",

The food service setup is something that you might expect to see at a fair - a cart with a hot table sort of set up.  The staff was so super friendly.    I ordered the Mac-n-Cheese and Green beans.  As a vegetarian I am not into BBQ but my hubby is and he said his rib tips were excellent.  Sometimes you just gotta go to a cool place for the experience :)  I did not eat the Green Beans as they had what looked like perhaps pieces of ham in them.  I did eat the Mac-n-Cheese and it was CRAZY GOOD! It was ooey, gooey, cheesy feel great food.  I also had the corn bread and it was awesome!  It was moist with just touch of sweetness.

The brisket was overcooked, the pulled pork was too salty and covered in too much sauce. The only thing I liked was the green beans and cornbread.   On a more positive note, the butcher side of the house was great! I bought a 3lb tri-tip, 5lbs links and 4lbs ribeye all for $82. Such a great deal and fantastic cuts of meat. I would definitely still come here to purchase meats from the butcher shop.",

So I want to make clear i'm not reviewing the Butcher Shop i'm reviewing the Road Kill Grill. So I only ever really come to this place once in a blue moon and I've had really good experiences and really bad. The food is great and the service is fast, they really get you in and out in a jiffy. However it sort of depends whose working the food counter. I've gotten sick from their Mac & Cheese before and ended up getting food poisoning but I've gone back and had great meals. This past meal that I had was fantastic, fresh, well prepared, and delicious.  I guess it sort of depends on what time of day you go. The time that I got sick I went close to closing (they are only open till 6pm and I went around 5pm) and the time that I went when I had a great meal was around lunch time. I guess it just depends on when you go. Otherwise a decent restaurant for a decent price.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas from NYC visiting a friend who lives in the northern part of the city, and one of the things I love to do when I'm someone's house guest is to cook for them. Since we're both meat loving carnivores, and I had a car, I made it my mission to find a good butcher shop - no matter where it was.   And thanks to Yelp, I found John Mull's.  When I first drove into the gravel parking lot, I thought \"am I in the right place?\" It's a long, squat building with no windows and one clearly marked entrance door.    Be a little careful opening the door - the ordering area is a a small industrial space with only a counter and the packaging area behind it, and it can get kind of crowded in there. But don't let that deter you. You'll be warmly greeted as soon as you walk in.  It's not like a traditional butcher shop where everything's displayed in glass-fronted cases. You order from a one sheet double-sided paper menu, which you pick up at the counter. If you have any questions about what cut of meat you need or how much, the woman at the counter is super knowledgeable and will happily make suggestions for you.   You place your order with her, and then it's brought out from a meat locker in the back for  them to package up.   I went in for some bacon and a pork shoulder, and ended up with not only that, but a couple of pounds of goat and some Italian sausages as well. And let me tell you, when I unwrapped everything I was not disappointed. All the cuts were beautiful, but that goat meat was amazing.   It can be a bit of a schlep to get there, but if you're a meataholic this is definitely your place.",

I have gone a few times and my favorite meats are the pulled pork and ribs.. but everything is delicious! The dry-rub, slow smoked ribs just melt in your mouth and take you to a happy place!

We had some time on our hands so we drove up on Veterans Day.  You might get lost, it is in the middle of a horse zoned residential area.  There wasn't an item we didn't try, between what I got, my friend got and what we brought home for my husband.  We had chicken, brisket, hot link, ribs, rib tips, mac salad, potato salad, mac n cheese and beans.  My #1 side is the potato salad, don' t be fooled it is one of a kind.  The hot link was pretty much blow your mind.  Sauce or no sauce this is REAL BBQ.",

We called in an order for the DECATUR store. We went to the address listed in YELP. The address was COMPLETELY WRONG! We called to see where it was because we couldn't find it, and they said that YELP put in the wrong address, and they couldn't fix it. (God forbid they would have told us that when we ordered the food.) YELP also had ONLY 1 PHONE NUMBER for John Mulls. They told us we had to go about another 10-15 minutes out of the way. We FINALLY got to the restaurant and they said they didn't have our order there. To make this shorter, the counter guy called \"Miss Rita\" and she said we were LYING, and that we NEVER ordered it for the Decatur store.(We even called back to find the damn location!!) She was talking SO LOUD and was SO NASTY on the phone to the counter guy, that we could hear her over the counter! The poor guy was embarassed. The story continues...but basically we will NEVER give another dime to \"Miss Rita!!\" Quite frankly \"Miss Rita\" is a B!",

It's worth the 25 min. drive from Henderson.  Not knowing the HUGE portions I ordered a 3 meat combo. Two sides come with it.  I got the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. Sides were mac n cheese and green beans.  Ribs pulled off the bone, needed the bbq sauce provided at no charge. Pulled Pork was tasty, and the brisket seemed to be stored in a broth. odd..... I did love the mac n cheese, and the green beans seem to be out of a can? Served with a potato chunk. Got the apple cobbler and will try the peach cobbler next time.  YES there will be a next time. Will go on a tues or thurs so I can get the tri-tips.",

I decided since I had driving so far I might as well try it, so I waited in line for about 45 minutes and had to take the food with as I was running out of time. They were nice as they offered free beer on Saturdays and sampled the line once with food. The food was OK but not worth standing in line for, but would I go there again , no. .",

Make sure the weather is good because all the seating is outdoors. Since this is Vegas, it hardly ever disappoints.  My wife and I ordered the 3-meat plate with tri-tip, rib tips, and the pulled pork. The two complementary sides we ordered were the cole slaw and the much regarded mac-n-cheese.  Let me start with the rib tips since that is the reason I came. If I could eat only these, I would be a happy man. The meat is tender, seasoned perfect, and cooked perfectly as well. The tri-tip (which is served only on Tuesdays and Thursdays) was thinly sliced, tender, juicy, and much better with the sauce. The pulled pork was a close second to the rib-tips. It was tender, juicy, not too much sauce, and incredible flavor. The mac-n-cheese is not your run of the mill pasta and powdered cheese sauce crap from a box. It is giant pasta, real cheese, meat, and pretty decent flavor. Not bad, but then again, I'm not a mac-n-cheese fan. Finally, the cole slaw. You can really tell whether a BBQ joint is serious by their cole slaw. Sadly, we found a long hair on the first bite and I just couldn't bring myself to try any of it. We ended with the peach cobbler which was outstanding.  I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, I can still taste those rib-tips. Unfortunately the hairy cole slaw just can't be shrugged off. If I return, it will be for the rib tips, and not for any sides. But, they do have other meat selections that I would like to try. After all, this is a butcher shop and it appears they do know how to prepare meat.",

We chose the pulled pork, brisket, and hot links with cornbread, green beans and mac and cheese. Wow! I have a new standard for BBQ and it's John Mull's!   The pulled pork was my favorite: it wasn't fatty or greasy-- it was tender and well seasoned. Green beans had a unique flavor and the cornbread was just right. The experience was made better by how nice the BBQ staff was and the feeling of being at a backyard BBQ.   I will come back here whenever I'm in Vegas and recommend it vehemently.",

It's literally in the middle of nowhere but that adds to the allure and craving, you know it's going to be a drive but well worth it! The staff is the most friendly bunch of people working in one place I've ever met. You're sure to be greeted at the door with a smile and a food sample. Meanwhile I love hearing the ladies call me, \"baby.\" \"How's your day going baby?\" The food is off the charts delicious. This is what the long drive is all about. I've made it my personal mission to sample the best BBQ in the country and Road Kill Grill is tops. Fill the car with gas, grab some waters and start your playlist you won't regret the drive!

I  go for the butcher shop but I've had the bbq and it's on point. The butcher shop is staffed by friendly people who are kind if not busy and know their business. I regularly buy marrow bones for my dog for a great treat. I've gotten a trimmed brisket (uncooked but I've tried the cooked) and was pleased with the beautiful quality. *warning* if your ordering for holidays (they do fresh cuts of meat and even smoked turkeys) order early and pick up early. It gets really busy even the weekend or a few days before a holiday. Though, whatever the wait you'll leave happy and  excited for the meal to come.  The staff is extremely kind, though sometimes a bit busy but they always make time to listen to your questions regarding the butcher shop or the bbq grill.  Guy Fieri was not wrong to feature John Mulls meats on Triple D  it's first years.",

Employees are working hard with smiles on their faces, though.  But you come here for the food!  The three meat plate is the best value, and the portions are huge- this is easily split between a couple, add on a dessert if you dare. The HOTLINK is \"easily one of the best I've had,\" says the BF. We both thought the RIB TIPS were amazing, and were both a little pickier than necessary about the BRISKET- blame our time in Texas for that, but it's still lightyears better than most other versions here in Vegas. The sides are pretty solid, too: the COLLARD GREENS are seasoned well with meat and onions mixed in, but the MAC AND CHEESE wins all the awards here- it's one of the best versions I've had outside of someone's home. The CORNBREAD and PEACH COBBLER also were really good, and clearly homemade.  Menu is small, but everything we tried was really well executed. Location has some limitations, but I like the down home style. I'll definitely be keeping it in mind the next time a barbecue craving hits.",

    "text": "\"Imma fixin to get me some good ole BBQ and was a wonderin if you'd like some too?\" announces my MIDWEST poker bud with a stupid grin on his face.  \"Umm, OK\" staring quizzically at him.  \"Aright then.  Let's get a move on\" he continues.  \"By any chance, did you walk face first into the glass door?\"  I say as I slap him on the back of the head.  And we're off.  Straight to it, John Mull's Road Kill Grill has been featured on the Food Network's Triple D.  Don't hold it against them.  For once, you won't be misled.   IMPORTANT:  This isn't BBQ.  Low and slow?  Nope.  This is grilling.  Marinades, not dry rubs, boiled, then finished over a high heat charcoal grill.  Understand this or be ready for disappointment.  That said, it's tasty for what it is.   The boiled then grilled ribs have a good flavor with a warm heat and pronounced black pepper flavor all the way to the bone.  Tender and good sauceless.  The tri-tip, cooked well done, still retains good juiciness.  Well seasoned and just fine without any sauce.  The chicken, taste like grilled chicken.  Fall off the bone with good flavor.  Alright but not special.  Hotlinks steal the show.  Beefy, juicy, spicy, good texture and a gentle smokiness. Finished on the grill for an even smokier taste.  I can see  why a fellow Hawaii yeep has to buy these by the case to bring home.  No complaints on the mac & cheese, baked beans, and green beans and corn bread, although all are completely unnecessary.  You don't see tigers eating sides when there's meat right?  Tip:  Tri-Tip available Tues / Thurs.    Service makes this place.  Very friendly and welcoming.  A plus when the line is long and they run out of your favorite forcing you to substitute or wait for the next batch.  (It's worth the wait, they will load you up for your patience).  In the end, a solid eatery serving solid food.  So it isn't real BBQ.  All good.  This isn't Texas, Kansas, or the Carolinas.  This is Vegas baby and as the song goes, \"I did it my way\".",

The Mac n cheese and brisket is my go to, but like I've said I've pretty much had the entire menu . It's always crowded especially around lunch time on the weekdays and the weekends just remain busy. The staff is ALWAYS very friendly you feel welcoming everyone greets you. I like the fact that over the years I pretty much see the same staff working their, some new faces which is normal in a work place. You definitely have to try this place don't bother with famous Dave's or Lucille's this place is better !!",

We said we would be back when they were open, but they said \"come on in we can fix you something\" My wife got rib tips and I got brisket, and I must say wow! Some BBQ I have had in a long time.   The thing that surprised me was they had closed down register and they wouldn't let me pay.  I couldn't believe it, that something that I have not seen in a long time, reminds me of being home in the south. Needless to say I will be back on Monday to pay them back for their  kindness.

We both ordered the 3 item combo, I had chicken, brisket and a hot link, sides included some awesome chili beans, Mac n chese and sweet potatoes. I had corn bread. THAT WAS OUR OF THIS WORLD AWESOME.

We ordered the brisket, ribs, sausage & chicken. For the sides, coleslaw, potato salad, baked beans, collard greens & green beans which were all good.  It was a lot of food for the 4 of us.   On the way to the bathroom in the back is where all the cooking was done...by one man! He was so friendly and kind enough to open up all the grills and show me what was cookin'!  What made our visit here the most memorable was these big 4x4's delivering what seemed to look like fresh hunted deer being off-loaded right in front of the eating area!!!WAY COOL!

I parked and look at the signs and realize Guy Fieri was here. Ok Cool! Been to many places with his name on the wall. Looks good from outside. It screams home diner. People were lined up out the door for this place. Sometimes this indicates that the food is good and the place is popular. However, once I got through the door, the place was not ideal for a crowd waiting to order food. The inside was very small. The employees were kinda rude by telling us to wait outside because the door and freezer can't be blocked. Ok safety! I get it. But a bit rude. No one was giving us any indication when to come in since we are waiting outside. Although they tried to make up with free rib tips that I passed up on. They were not appealing. The place was set up like a soup kitchen. In through the front door and out the back. Not very appealing. Once I saw the brisket and Pulled pork sitting in liquid, I knew I was going to be disappointed. The brisket was fully cooked with no smoke ring. I'm sure it was smoked. But Meat soaking in a vat is not how bbq is supposed to be served. Fresh brisket should be cut right in front of the customer.  The pulled pork was very very salty and too wet for my taste. The green beans were over cooked and the Mac n cheese was ok if your hungry but needed to be heated up. The cheese was not melted at all. After living in Texas for 5 years and consuming some of the the best brisket in the world in Austin and growing up on VA/NC BBQ, it's hard to recommend this diner. 2 stars only for the outdoor atmosphere that screams bbq joint. But food prep and of course the bbq is not appealing at all.",

    "text": "I grew up down south, and BBQ is a way of life to us. I consider myself to be a pretty good BBQ chef and connoisseur. I grew up Qin' weekly, and have cooked almost everything you can cook on the grill. Due to my profession I travel frequently, and have eaten BBQ in Memphis, Texas, Georgia, St. Louis, Louisiana, California, South Carolina, and the list goes on and on. I was a bit skeptical, and apprehensive I must admit, when I went to road kill grill for the first time. Due to the fact that I had tried every other BBQ joint in Vegas, and had been disappointed so far. It was a bit cramped coming in the door because everything is cafeteria style and you stand in a single file line to order, but it moves rather quickly. While you stand there and wait they do give you free samples of the meats which is very nice, and it also helps you decide what to order. Everything is hot and fresh, and always available. I've tried everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed. The portions are huge! I always bring home leftovers. The BBQ sauce is exquisite with the perfect amount of spice. The price is good for what you get. The only thing I would change about the place is the ordering system. The food is hands down the best BBQ available in Las Vegas! I would recommend this joint to anybody who wants awesome BBQ!",

    "text": "First the good.   -The service was quick and friendly enough. -The menu is simple and has a fair variety of choices. -The brisket had a good flavor to it, despite its shortcomings (more on that in the bad) -The ribs were well cooked. -Good snap to the hot link. -A lot of food for the money.  Now, the bad.  -The pulled pork was DROWNED in sauce.  I mean, an unbelievable amount of sauce.  Great BBQ should let you taste the meat...even sauce based BBQs don't put that much sauce.  Also, the sauce was not that good. -The hot link was also drowned in sauce.  See above. -I did not care for the ribs.  I found their flavor to be lacking.  They were, as I said, well cooked, but the flavor was mediocre. -The brisket is sitting in a steaming vat of au jus, which overcooks it.  When they served it to me, it was solid gray, and super hot from the sitting the juice.  The taste of the meat was better than expected, but the meat itself was way overcooked. -The sandwiches are served with the super hot meats straight from their steam trays, and then packed into a Styrofoam container, which turns it into a bread based sauna.  By the time I walked out to the benches to eat it, the bread was a soggy mush. -The peach cobbler was WAY too heavy on the nutmeg.  I shared some with my two friends without saying anything and both said \"too much nutmeg.\" -Canned soda.  Seriously?  How about a soda fountain.  On the PLUS side, the cans were only $1 which is not too bad for a can in a restaurant.  However, I still hate getting a can in a restaurant.  Overall, the food was decent to mediocre.  Prices were very good, but I would rather pay more for food that makes me want to overindulge to finish every last bite, not throw away half of what is left because I don't feel like it would be worth the calories.",

My friend \"O\" remembered this place as being a great meat market and I recalled the triple D episode on it, so we faxed our order in.  O said she got there early, just before the rush!  Our pork ribs were da bomb, tender and flavorful--very generous portions of thinly sliced, tasty brisket, too.  Mac-n-cheese was nice, but the star side order for me was the green beans, with ham hocks and potatoes and spot-on seasoning.  We were so achingly full after the ribs and all, but still dug into the desserts.  OMG, the warm peach cobbler was almost orgasmic--seriously.  Anyway, great lunch for us, with enough leftover for dinner!",

The spicy BBQ sauce was the best part about the meal. I also do not like how you have to wait in the same damn room that they sell the butcher meat in which is already an extremely small place & the door is constantly bumping someone in the ass. This place is WAY OVERRATED. I have eaten from their truck before & for some reason it was better. The sad thing is that since that Guy Fieri said it was good on his Drive-Ins & Dives show every sheep in Las Vegas can't think with their own tastebuds... either that or BBQ has some really slim pickins in Sin City.",

    "text": "I cannot even begin to fathom all the great ratings this place has!  I'm a fan of BBQ and have had great BBQ from all the great BBQ places in the states.  Memphis, Texas, the Carolina's.  Made a special trip to this place while in Vegas because of all the great reviews and the spot on Triple D.  Guy wouldn't steer me wrong, would he?  Arrive at about 1:30 on a Monday to a crazy long line.  The smell was intoxicating and I don't mind waiting for great Q.  Was told it would be about 30 min, so ok into the line I went.  Could not figure out for the life of me why the line moved so dang slow, but about every 15 min it moved a few feet.  30 min go by and we are not even close to the magic door where they let 5 people at a time in to order.  I'm intrigued by the set up, I must see what's going on inside that door that could possibly make this go so slow!  30 min turns into an hour, turns into 90 min, turns into 2 hours.  I thought about leaving several times, but I was hungry, and the smell, and those reviews kept me in line!  Finally get inside the mystery door to reveal another line of about 10 people still waiting to place their order!  Are you kidding me?  Seriously the most inefficient set up I've every seen.  While all the employees are very friendly and make small talk with each and every customer, I really would prefer a quicker experience.  One guy in charge of the meats and sides.  another guy desserts and ringing you up.  That's it--2 people working the line.  Had there been 1 guy doing meat, 1 guy doing sides, 1 doing desserts, & 1 ringing people up the wait would have been reduced significantly.  Guess what?  Serve more customers, make more money?  Serve more customers who don't wait 2.5 hours for mediocre food, you get return customers which means even more profit.  I guess this place just doesn't care about that sort of stuff.  On to the food.  We order a 3 meat combo--brisket, pulled pork and rib tips.  Sides of Mac & cheese, potato and mac salad and baked beans.  got all 3 cobblers to try.  Rib tips were dry and chewy and could barely get them down.  Pulled pork was ok, but I prefer to sauce my own stuff.  If I don't like your sauce, then I want it without.  The brisket was presliced and sitting in brisket juice?  It had a unappealing brown texture and pieces that we got in our order had been sliced with the grain.  A big no no when slicing any kind of meat like that.  The taste wasn't bad, I just prefer my brisket freshly sliced from the whole brisket not presliced.  The smoke flavor seemed like it was not from the wood, but from a liquid smoke.  Sides were just ok.  Mac & cheese was my favorite but we got the last of a pan of it and it had been sitting for a while.  Potato & mac salad don't taste freshly made.  Cobblers are made with big cans of pie filling.  How hard is it to slice fresh apples for a better product?  All in all disappointed, threw most of it in the garbage.  Can't recommend and won't return.  I'm mad at you Guy Fieri!",

It's not a actual restaurant but a outside bbq area and a store where you can order meats by the pound (I stumbled on This part by accident, what's behind door number 1, lol). Lots of seating under a few shaded areas. They usually accept cards for payment but always a good idea to have cash as their machine was down when we went on a Saturday and a lot of people were turned away. They gave free water for the inconvenience but usually they sell water and sodas. Watch as they prepare you order as they are putting several orders very quickly and sometimes will give you something you didn't order. BBQ was really good and price point is average, our bill was $33+ for two of us but the two meat combo with two sides was enough to feed two people and the sandwich was pretty large as well. We also ordered two cobblers, a apple and cherry and I would not purchase them again as they were very bland. Looking forward to a visit earlier in the day as we arrived just before 6 pm when they close and probably got the last of what was left from the days cooking.",

The entrance was a little hard to figure out but we got it pretty quickly. When we entered this tiny little spot we were greeted pleasantly by one of the employees. We told him we had never been there before and he asked if we would like to sample anything. I asked to try the burnt ends because I've always wanted to order them but every place I go is always sold out. To my surprise he gives my wife and I a few hearty pieces to try. I fell in love. The most juicy, smokey, tasty meat I've ever tried. My wife then asked to try the hot links, another nice size sample for us both to enjoy. She decided they were just a bit too spicy for her so she got the pulled pork sandwich. For sides we went with Mac & Cheese, Cole slaw and Yams. It also came with corn bread. Everything was awesome! For 14.95 the ends and 2 sides was too much for me to finish! And I'm a big guy! I'm kinda glad it's far from my house because I would go broke at this spot! Amazing food and very nice people! A must try!",

I am from the South and I saw this on Triple D which I must admit I have been less than impressed by some of the places I have been to that have been on that show.  This place is the real deal!  They have the biggest portions I have ever seen!!  I had the pulled pork, brisket, and burnt ends.  My cousins and I also order the hot links as a side which cannot be missed repeat CANNOT be missed!!!  Everything was spectacular!!!  The BBQ sauce was spot on, and everything was not oversmoked like some places.  My sides were mac n cheese (my go to) and greens (tender but not too tender, perfect in my opinion).    This place I must tell you is hidden in a residential area way outside the strip.  It is well worth the trip.  I am adding it to my must visits when in Vegas for great BBQ!!!",

    "text": "So you think that you've had the very best BBQ in Las Vegas? Uh...nope! Prepare for your mind to be blown and your taste buds to be rocked! Road Kill Grill!  First off, when GPS nav'd us to the Thom location,  I thought for sure that \"she\" had finally given in to the stress of her job! This place is in the middle of a neighborhood, but don't be alarmed... you are in the right place. Pull into the lot, disembark from the ChalGal, and the aroma. You know that sweet smell of summer that you get from someone else's backyard that prompts you to BBQ? Yep... we were in the right place! If I was still in real estate,  I would promote the heck out of that neighborhood! Navigate our way to a plain door,  no neon lights,  no real sign... just people standing in line - salivating,  quietly in anticipation! Not knowing the haps, I'm thinking that someone comes out to get you and escorts you somewhere else? Uh no... the door opens and this small-ish area is filled with people! Butcher counter, food counter, sweet lady taking orders, a room filled with excitement!  We had already perused the menu (black diamond difficult choices), so knew what we wanted... then promptly changed our mind when we saw the pork ribs! It's a swine thing, I told ya! Staff was friendly, ordering was easy,  really the whole process was easy... until we waited mere minutes for our order! Time dragged... Pay and take our food out to a covered area with patio heaters. Dig in... First off, pleasantly pleased to see the corn muffin is a muffin top only! WTG RKG! Next, I cannot take a bite of the Briscuit Sandwich because there is too much sliced deliciousness on that soft roll. Fingers... meat... sauce - have to try it, sauce is totally unnecessary. Mind blown! Oh... and that sauce, by the way. This is no watered down, thin BBQ sauce. This sauce has structure,  it coats the back of the spoon. Not super sweet, just enough. It would be good on almost anything, but really unnecessary for the meat!  Next on to the pork ribs! These are not fatty and greasy,  these are meaty and have an amazing rich density to them. Make sense? Again,  no sauce needed.  Same for the pulled Pork, whatever the method... it is perfection!  Mac n Cheese - cheesy and hearty,  Yams were perfectly cooked and seasoned (nothing worse than \"baby food\" yams!  The Cobblers! I ordered dessert at the register. The gal goes to serve it, directly from the double door stand up \"hot box\" right behind her! Biggest pans of flaky-sugary crusted,  fruity,  bubbly goodness I had ever seen (oh my God, Becky, did you see the size of that Cobbler?) Everything about this meal was superb,  including the fact that we had plenty for a late night, post-casino-hopping dinner... and I do mean PLENTY! Bookmark this one, add it to the itinerary....You're welcome!  Oh,  and when the chef comes through with chafing trays of food (mac n cheese, sliced Briscuit, cobbler, BBQ chicken, etc...) tell him \"Thank You\"! You will get one of the biggest smiles - one of those ear-to-ear ones...and tell him \"Hi! from Sunshine\".",

I have had almost every place in town and most are just average . I parked and went in the door and there was a big line . It went pretty good for the speed . I got 2 two meat platters for me and my son . Took them home and we ate for 2 days on it . I even made a You Tube Video for my channel Tips From A Bellman . This is the link to video : <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXeS44AzQLEU&s=cf4ee1cac14fa460d537c1e5398a4128b6d2d893b37805108c1b46179579e60b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=XeS4...</a>  Okay , here we go . Hot Links are the best in town and so is the pulled chicken . I got two cups each of the Spicy BBQ sauce and the Original BBQ sauce . The pulled chicken needs no sauce , smoky with a touch of sauce already on it . The pulled pork taste better with the spicy bbq and the burnt ends taste better with the original bbq sauce . The Mac & Cheese is the best I have ever had and I sincerely mean it . Get yourself two sides of it ! The beans were kind of plain , Famous Dave's has the best beans . The coleslaw my son and I both hated . Potatoe salad was kind of plain , but not bad . Got the corn bread which was moist and not that baked dry kind . Overall I will be back when I am on that side of town .",

I've driven down Gowan a gazillion times and had no idea that barbecue paradise was just a left turn down Thom! The food was excellent! We each had the 3 meat combo/2 sides meal (brisket, pulled pork & ribs). We chose potato salad, baked beans, mac & cheese and greens for our sides. The only item that missed the mark were the greens (bland) but everything else was so on point that they were still able to maintain 5 stars.   They serve very healthy portions, the service was great and their pricing is right on target!  They had a live soul band including vocalists which created a very festive vibe. It was a great distraction from the long wait!!! Yes it's a bit of a wait (like Magic Mountain roller coaster wait time...no really lol) so wear comfy shoes but I guarantee you that it will be worth the wait!   We will definitely be back...with chairs and sunscreen...because of the long wait time....no seriously lol!",

It did not make it back to work.  The chicken was moist, full of smoke flavor.  I am eating the cold leftovers as I write this review.  Still delicious!  My first side was the collard greens. Cooked perfectly and not too salty, the greens were mixed with delicious pieces of bbq meat.  My second side was the green beans, again mixed with pieces of meat.  It also had chunks of baked potato - DELICIOUS!  I was offered mild or spicy sauce.  The spicy was smoky perfection.  I cannot wait to get home and cook some of the chicken breasts!

    "text": "I just didn't have the same experience that other people did.  I ordered the link, the brisket, and the ribs.  All three were dry.  I'm enclosing a picture.  I saw DDD and Guy holds up one of the links to the camera to show the juices coming out but mine was nothing like that.  Most reviews say the food is moist so I'm guessing that I got a bad batch.  A couple of less than average reviews say the meat was dry so maybe I was one of the unlucky ones.  One thing I noticed right off the bat was that the food is kept in warming bins, which was surprising.  When the server took off the lid to the links they just didn't look very appetizing.  I noticed from other reviews is that a lot of other people ordered items that had sauce in it, like the pulled pork or the cut links.  Maybe if you get 3 items that have no sauce there's nothing there to give it moisture.  The mac & cheese was good; I don't usually like since it never really lives up to the promise, but this serving did.  Very good overall.  The staff were friendly.  I arrived at 11:30 and avoided most of the rush.  I was the 2nd person in line when I ordered, but when I got outside the line was out the door.  I arrived earlier to try to get more \"fresh\" product but that's just not what I got.",

    "text": "Apparently John Mull didn't pay attention to the old adage \"location, location, location\" and if this place was judged solely on first impressions they may be in trouble. Located near Rancho and Gowan, smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood, the Road Kill Grill had me wondering as we rolled up into the dirt/rock driveway. It seemed as though I was thrust into the middle of  some sort of unsolved murder/mystery documentary. It just didn't seem right. Are they really going to serve us \"road kill?\" is the thought that kept running through my mind.  Just as we approached and entered, thoughts of normalcy began to take over again, that is until I spotted the stuffed coyote inside the meat shop/restaurant. I was with a group of people and couldn't let my fears get the worst of me and just run out. Besides, I didn't think I'd be able to find my way back to the main road.   We were greeted by a very friendly, knowledgable man who briefed all of the \"Road Kill Virgins\" on what exactly it was we were getting ourselves into. It's \"Tri-Tip day\" he exclaims. Okay, now I'm interested. As he's taking orders, I'm looking at the menu, but have pretty much decided on the Tri-Tip. My buddy orders a three meat combo. Not to be outdone when it comes to grub, I order three meats as well. Tri-Tip, Hot Links and Brisket with cole slaw and good 'ol mac n cheese. It was like I'd died and gone to a pic-nic in Heaven. The Tri-Tip was some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of consuming and the mac n cheese was some kind of tasty. The hot links were sliced up and smothered in bbq sauce and the coleslaw could almost compete with grandma's  (nothing ever will, but their's was pretty darn good).  The only thing that would have made the meal better would have been a huge glass of iced tea with lots of ice. The draw back here is that it's bottled water or canned soda, that's it. But hey, a regular showed up with a cooler full of his favorite beverage and nobody batted an eye. There is no inside seating, so good weather is vital. Or better yet, just grab it to go and take it home. It does travel well, too, as we couldn't finish it all and took some back for a co-worker. He was impressed as well.   Not that they would have to twist my arm to come back, but they offer free beer on Saturday. Maybe I have died and gone to a bbq in Heaven.",

But I quickly got over that once I was hit with the wonderful smell of barbecue smoke. The line was not long, however the family of six in front of me had some issues deciphering the menu. The young lady took my order and I was on my way to rib heaven. I order a slab of ribs with the baked beans. I waited until I got home to eat, as there is no dainty way to tear into ribs.  The ribs were moist, tender and divine. They put all the other chain barbecue restaurants to shame. The baked beans were delicious as well. They had ground beef in them and a smoky sweet flavor. I will be returning when I get another rib craving.",

No complaints there.  The sides were pretty good I guess. The BBQ was really bad if I'm being honest. I ordered 3 meat meal. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs. I also ordered a side of burnt ends.   Brisket: it almost tasted boiled with a smoke flavored addon.   Pulled pork: had a really strange and strong Vinegar flavor. Almost completely vinegar.   Ribs: they tasted good for the most part. Wasn't blown away by any means. They were tender  Burnt ends: these were definitely cooked the best of all the meats I ordered however they were too sweet for me.   Baked beans: awesome flavor. Nice hint of either jalapeno or green peppers but not spicy.   Mac/cheese: tasted like it had been sitting too long  Cobblers: cherry/Apple: these were ok. Could have used more crust. The filling tasted like it came from a can. Not a huge deal to me, just didn't feel like anything unique.   I feel the place has the look and service but lacks in quality.  All the 5star reviews just don't really make sense to me. I have heard after the fact from a friend that it use to be better. I have had better meals at chain BBQ joints at the same or less price. Doubt I will be back and definitely wouldn't bring visitors from out of town there.",

I ordered the 3 meat combo.... tri tip, ribs and 1/4 chicken with mac & cheese and baked beans.  They also include cornbread. The sides were awesome... well flavored, moist and enjoyable.   The corn was also very good, Then to the meats, The chicken was horribly dry.  Couldn't eat it at all The ribs were also very dry.  I guess you have to smother them in sauce to even eat them. If that's the case, why not serve cardboard. The tri tip, at least had some moisture and meat flavor. I will not be back and I highly do not recommend. Being from SoCal, we highly recommend Phil's BBQ,  a little more pricey, but much better BBQ.",

You order and pay and they pull your order from the grill and call your name.  It's pretty simple really.   You can buy Tshirts if you wish, Or order cuts of meat from inside. It's a small room and kind of dungeon like but a lot of people were ordering so it must be good as well. The butcher is right there for you to watch.   We shared a 3 meat combo...ribs which were super tender, brisket that melted in my mouth with flavor and the hot link. Man oh man the hot link...I loved it. Perfectly cooked with a kick that keeps you wanting more.   We had Mac n cheese and potato salad for sides. Both were fresh and very good. The Mac was so cheesy!

It looks like this is where I'll be having lunch tomorrow",

The meat was tender and good. Liked the mild bbq sauce. Baked beans and potato salad were tasty. Price was reasonable. 18.00 for one combo plate with two drinks(we shared),and was plenty of food. We gave 4 stars due to the service. Waited 50 minutes in a line. They needed help to put food in plastic plate. All the food was cooked and in cafeteria style set up.   Bottom line food was good, but service not so much.",

To even contemplate a choice between this place and another - would be tantamount to trying to decide whether you should sleep in heaven's bed or on cold concrete flooring. There is no choice to be made.  Road Kill is second to NONE!!!!!    This place is the epitome of True BBQ.  There are no words in our vocabulary to describe the ecstasy your mouth will experience when your taste buds meet the pulled pork, tri-tips, ribs, chicken, sausages - Lord have mercy on your soul.   For sides - my favorite is mixing the beans with potato salad.  Dios Mio!  The only suggested change I have?  The bread - they need real corn bread.  Easy and inexpensive to make.    Otherwise - what are you waiting for!  Go!",

    "text": "I've been to this place like 6 or 7 times. I was addicted for like 2 weeks, until I decided to get some help lol. I had to have it like 3 times a week. I'm happy the addiction is over because I've saved some money, but I'm also slightly sad because this place is really convenient, when I'm craving BBQ.  What I love about this place is that the guys that work there are really sweet. They make me feel so comfortable eating there. They joke and play with me like I'm family. I like that it only took 2 visits for them to know my name and face. I really like that they aren't as stuck up as a lot of people I come in contact with in these Vegas restaurants. I don't have a complaint with any of them nor have I had anything other than perfect service from there.  Now to the food. The very 1st time I stepped foot in this place, I was expecting some awesome BBQ. I knew that it was going to be good food because I had overheard a lot of people discussing how delicious everything is. I was pumped to taste some things.  The first thing I ordered was a 3 Meat Combo for 16.65. Included in the combo was 3 Meats (Hot Links, Pulled Pork and Rib Tips) and 2 sides (Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans). I was pissed when I seen that, although I was getting 3 meats, they reduced the serving size of the Rib Tips, so it was like I was really only getting half of the serving size. I wanted my other damn half, because I was splitting it with my friend, and I didn't think what they had on the plate was going to be enough to fill both of us up. I didn't say anything but I guess the server could see the disappointment in my face.  This is where they won me over. The server asked the guy that was starting the plates, to box another order of Rib Tips. I was extremely happy because it looked as if I had 4 or 5 tips originally. I wasn't expecting him to give me an entire order to make up for the lack of tips in the platter though.  When I made it to my car and opened my container of food, I had a full serving of Pulled Pork, a full serving of hot links and over a full serving of Rib Tips. Not only did we have enough food to fill us up, we had some for later. Can you say HAPPY?  Now to the taste. All of the meats were great. I liked the favor of the meats. The Pork was seasoned perfectly, the Hot Links were warm and spicy, just like I like them, and the Rib Tips were very meaty and delicious. It was all awesome. My friend and I both agreed.  Now, the sides, on the other hand, needed some work. The Mac&Cheese tasted like it had sour cream in it. A friend told me that he think that there's a bunch of different cheeses in it. For the record, it was cheesy, but I have never had cheese to taste as sour as it did. It wasn't good at all. The Baked Beans were really runny. I had mostly juice in the container. There were a few beans at the bottom of the container, and when I did get to them, they tasted pretty good.  I was addicted to that 1st experience, but sadly to say, no other visit, after that one, was as perfect. The food began to take a downward spiral. Every time I would go things would get worse. The Rib Tips became greasy and hard to keep down. The Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken became really sweet. It had way too much BBQ Sauce in it and it was only lukewarm. As a matter of fact, most of everything was only lukewarm.  I'm very disappointed in the place because I was 85% satisfied with the food and 100% satisfied with the service. Now I have to find a new BBQ Joint. I know that anywhere else I go, the service will be nothing compared to this place. Before I switch BBQ places, I will give them another chance though. I'm looking forward to trying again after I've given them a couple months to cool off. I think I was going too often. I guess no one can be perfect every time...  I have added this place to my \"You Once Had Me, Can You Get Me Back\" List.",

    "text": "Having tasted BBQ from around the country, I understand what \"Southern\" BBQ is: cheap cuts of meat and cheap ingredients that the lower income population had available to turn and twist into something good.  I went here based upon several 5-star ratings, but I just wasn't excited about this place.   At around 5pm on a Tues, I ordered the tri-tip and pork ribs combo, with mac-n-cheese, can ice tea, spicy sauce, cornbread disk, about $15.93+tip.  The trip tip was a bit fatty, it did have a thin smoke ring, and maybe a 6oz portion.  it was cooked through, no pink.  Maybe it had sat for a while in the warmer, maybe not, but I was surprised at the fatty bits.  Usually, slow cooked tri tip has none or very little.  The three or four pork ribs were appropriately moist, but all the meats were bland enough to need the BBQ sauce.    The BBQ tomato sauce was ordered spicy, but needed more heat.  Thick, not watery at all.    Mac-n-cheese, looked like they're using a cheese that dries up after warming, tasted like they use Oxaca style, so not much cheddar or velveeta detected.  Noodles were done well, most were whole.    Cornbread was moist and buttery, needed no sauce or additional garnishment.    So, in reading so many recent 5 stars, I'll try again in a little while, to see if I just had a mediocre day or if I ordered the bland stuff.",

I had small party at home, so ordering bqq for around 15 people seemed an easy alternative to cooking.  Ordering: Brisket Pulled Chicken Mac 'n' Cheese Coleslaw  String beans and Potatoes  Everything was on time when we came to pick up. All food was hot and was amazingly delicious. All food was packed in containers that were not flimsy and were stacked into protective packaging that was easy to transport. Also when we picked up a gentleman came out and packed it in our car.   An easy breakdown is Food was awesome, service was fantastic and portion size was more than enough with an extremely reasonable price range. I highly recommend to anyone Road Kill Catering.

There are 2 more popular ways to order a 2 or 3 meat combo. Both come with 2 sides and your choice of dinner roll or corn bread. Here's what we LOVE: Brisket - this meat is so tender and flavorful! Ribs- delish and pretty tender. I prefer them with the spicy bbq sauce.  Chicken- you get to choose white or dark and you can't go wrong with either. The chicken is tender and has a great flavor.  Corn bread- ORDER EXTRA! I usually love honey on corn bread but theirs doesn't need it at all!  Peach cobbler- holy moly batman! I always regret not taking one home.   Is it the most convenient place to dine? No. However the food is fantastic and I've ran into more nice employees than those who aren't nice. The last time I went they were crazy busy because they had been on TV so the lines were LONG. They were passing out waters on the house. I highly recommend you go eat here, NOW.",

Greens had the perfect amount of seasoning to them even though I could have done with a little less run off and juices in the bowl. Over all a place I'll be heading back to time and time again!  Not to mention the staff there are amazing. Good vibe from the staff given the sketchy look of the interior. They do the food right people and that's all I care about. They have place outside, accompanied by a mister cooling line, that you can eat at. A covered portion with picnic tables and a nice area in the sun if you are there late enough.",

Driving there you might think you are headed over to someones house to eat, as it is buried in a residential area.  But it is worth the drive.  The food was really good! I assumed, by the name, that they might have some off-the-wall meat choices in the Grill section to taste.  But, it was just your standard barbeque.   I went with a double meat and two side meal.  The pulled chicken, servers choice between that and the pulled pork, was excellent!  The hot links were good but would have been better, I think, just plain and not doused in sauce.  Disappointed they didn't have collard greens as a side, I chose the Mac-n-cheese and green beans.  Both were outstanding!  Everything was fantastic and the amount of food they serve you is over the top! Talk about needing wheelbarrow assistance back out to the car...  The one major downside is there is no indoor area to enjoy the food.  So, it can be overwhelming to shovel all that food down the hatch while sitting outside (on a patio with shade) in the sweltering heat. (They are nice enough to provide a water misting system.) Dress cool!",

I thought the address was wrong because the place really is located amongst houses.   But it's a nice place.   There is plenty of parking in a private lot.   We found our way in to the grill.   It's just a simple block house building with the butcher side and the the grill side in it.   We studied the menu for a bit because it was our first time there.   The gals working the counter could not have been more patient and friendly with us.  We selected the three meat special for us to split.   We had ribs, brisket and the hot link with beans and mac and cheese for sides.   The food... well, wow!  It was great.   Everything was cooked well.  The hot link was not over powering but had a nice amount of warmth.  It was all so tasty.   We sat outside in the shade by a cooling mister.   That was pretty nice.   Thanks DDD!  Will I be back?  Heck yeah.   The food is delicious.",

My order was placed and I am just looking around when they bring out my slab of meat. I got 2 really fine looking 1 1/2\" beef rib-eye steaks and 1 pound of bacon. All the while the meat master behind the counter was talking to me and we had a few laughs.  So unfortunately I have never been good a grilling steaks. My father-in-law has ALWAYS been the master. Now I have award winning ribs,and pulled pork but the steak has always eluded me. Well today with a little salt and pepper on the steaks I placed them on the grill and hoped for the best. After 7 minutes on each side I pulled them and put them on the table. My son said over and over again how good it was. Even said they were better than Grandpas steaks. In my opinion? Yeah, they were fabulous. was it my grilling prowess? Maybe, but I am more apt to give the credit to John Mull's Meats and the amazingly fresh and better than any supermarket steaks.  Will I ever go back? YES! Because they have a full selection of hog,beef,and goat that they do,and I am hungry for more!!",

The sides were okay I don't really care for baked beans so I ordered some mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was very delicious. The pulled pork could have used a little bit more sauce but it was very tender and delicious. The chicken wasn't that great it was lacking flavor may be my personal preference. The ribs were very delicious I would definitely recommend going there. The staff is the reason why I gave it a 3 they are very unfriendly but I am sure it can be due to the high heat that they have to withstand waiting outside to take your order . It can get very very hot in Vegas so I would probably be cranky too working in hundred degree weather waiting for people to order food. If you're tired of the buffets in Vegas this is definitely worth the drive to head out for some BBQ .",

Don't let the location frighten you, as your GPS will guide you into a combination residential/commercial/farming/ranching part of Las Vegas not far from the strip.  My wife and I, along with our two teenagers were blown away by the quantity AND quality of the food!  Everything is homemade here.  The mac n' cheese is unbelievably delicious! Not-to-mention the brisket, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, green beans, baked beans, macaroni salad...and cobbler for dessert.  They make their own BBQ sauce used for dipping (both regular and hot).  We tried it all, and will definitely be back!  The eating area is all outside on picnic tables.  The owner made his way around the tables to greet everyone.  We went during a week night (he mentioned Fridays and Saturdays are the most crowded).  This place is an outstanding value for BBQ.  It will definitely be our first eating stop when we return to Vegas!",

I was debating on getting the hot link because that is what I saw them make on diners drive ins and dives and that's what made me want to try this place. The pulled pork had sauce mixed in already which I'm not a fan of. I like to taste the flavor of the pork before sauce is added. The meat should be able to stand alone. The ribs were on point. They were tender with a good smoke flavor. The brisket was disappointing. I feel like it was cooked with liquid smoke which is like a short cut to smoke meat. The potato salad was good but to me the star was the Mac and cheese. It was creamy and I tasted like three different kinds of cheese. I wish I would have got a double side of it. They have tri tip on Tuesdays and Thursdays for anyone planning to go. I wish I went there on one of those days because I'm a East coast guy and you can't find tri tip any where out there. So whenever I get the chance I get tri tip wherever I go.",

We literally stood outside the store for over an hour and there weren't 15 people ahead of us.  Then while we are standing there locals just keep walking in to \"go to the butcher shop side.\"  Then an incredibly obnoxious lady yells outside that the next 4 people can come inside, but our group had 5, so she then asked, \"can you people count.\"  Once inside you will notice that all of the food as is normal with BBQ is prepared and sitting in heating trays.  It still took another 25 minutes once we got inside.  This guy needs to learn how to SERVE and HOW RUN A RESAURANT.  Taste alone doesn't work for me.",

When we starting taking a pic (since we only knew about it from a feature on it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives), the owner came over and asked us if we wanted to take pic under the one of Guy - the owner was a nice guy himself.

    "text": "This had been a spot on my wish list for the last two years.  Glad to have gone for a visit but probably will not be back.  We had the 3 meat combo with pulled chicken, pulled pork and brisket.  Don't bother with the pulled chicken or the brisket.  Like many other of the Yelp reviewers say, the brisket was sub-par.  The brisket was our biggest disappointment.  The pulled pork was worth the eat.  But, the Mac-n-cheese and yams were excellent!  Great sides and average meats on this visit.    If you are a True BBQ and Triple D enthusiast, this place is worth a visit while in Las Vegas.  If you're looking for top BBQ spots in the west, you will be better served at some other spots.",

This is one of the  only places where you can order macaroni and cheese just like that and it comes out amazing... As if someone stayed up all night making it.   I'm not a big meat eater but these ribs are soooo tender and the side of sauce they give you to dip in is divine. And links. The links! The perfect pop and juiciness with the sear on the outside.   The line and ordering situation isn't for the weak of heart. This ain't some fancy restaurant with a cloth napkin baby.    This is real down home southern barbecuing (although, they do give you a wet nap ). There's even an old guy kinda talking mess to you from the meat slicer.   If you can get passed the outdoor seating and the crowded ordering area you'll find yourself in a tray of deliciousness.   & shout out to the couple that owns this place!! They're the cutest.",

Since it was very affordable, we had: burnt ends, pulled chicken, links, ribs, brisket, , chicken, and rib tips! The sides were coleslaw, Mac n cheese, macaroni salad, and corn bread.  The Mac and cheese was off the hook with a little bit of heat that made it different but in an amazing way. Everything was really good. The sauces were spicy and delicious. For dessert, I got the cherry cobbler which I didn't really care for so I wouldn't order that again but I'm definitely coming back for the bbq.",

    "text": "I am disappointed...I am disappointed in myself that I have not been to this place before. Being the only omnivore in my family of vegetarians my BBQ adventures are limited even though I enjoy it do much.   The Road Kill Grill lies in an odd part of Vegas protected by rural land use laws in a neighborhood west of Decatur and Gowan. This place has to be grandfathered in by zoning laws that would not allow this business to operate by today's guidelines.   Anyways, I had the 2 meat combo with sliced Brisket and pulled pork. Comes with two sides and bread, I chose green beans, potato salad, and corn bread. All we're very good, my beans were well seasoned. I usually judge a good barbecue place by their potato salad and this I would definitely get again. I also tried the baked beans which were meat and had a nice smokey flavor on this visit. Brisket was cooked and sliced perfect as well as very tender. The Beef was the highlight here with the absence of rubs and smoke ring. The pulled pork was chewy at times which can happen when sitting in a hot well prior to service. Overall good experience. Several other meat choices are available.  It was busy and the line was moving slowly. No big deal because the staff was friendly and happy to make conversation. The property is really cool and would be great for a private event. They have several tents and picnic tables available for seating. Catering is also available as well as full service butcher shop. If you need someone to process your deer from your fall hunt John Mull's will do that too.   Once again I am disappointed I have not been here sooner. Especially since it's very close to the house. I will be back often.",

Another 8 minutes went by, and same lady picks up and greets me as if she never began taking my order! Once I told her she stared my order already, SHE PLACES ME ON HOLD AGAIN!!!!   NEVER CALLING THERE AGAIN! It's pointless.. I might as well spend the 45 minutes waiting for my meat.. Calling does absolutely no justice! Why even have the option?!",

    "text": "So I heard about this place several years ago but I've never been able to make it to North Las Vegas. I've tried a whole lot of other BBQ places searching for the best BBQ I've had In Vegas.  I finally found it today.  It started with the smell from the parking lot. The smell makes the wait ok. It smells so good you get drawn in.   There is a line out the door. Once you walk in to the right is the fresh meat counter. You can order fresh meat , salami and even bones for your dog     To your left is where the line goes to the restaurant counter.   I tried the brisket, burnt ends and chicken. Oh also the beef rib.  In the rib dinner you get  one large beef rib. The bone cane out smooth in one easy pull.   The fat was rendered. This was unlike any rib I had eaten before. It was actually lean because the fat had rendered down.   The brisket was trimmed and only had a tiny layer of fat. Just enough to keep the meat moist. Heavenly smoke flavor.   The chicken was good. Nice smoke flavor.   The best was the burnt ends. Again trimmed lean with just enough sauce to make it extra delicious.   Tip: Don't wear a white shirt. The food isn't over sauced but juicy and it tends to splash a bit.   The sides like most BBQ places are just sides.  You came for the meat not the sides.   We ate out front and it was hunting season.  They had a bunch of hunters dropping off their kill for processing.   After we finished eating the guy that was accepting the kill gave us a tour of the plant.  They had a huge walk-in room full of carcasses that people Had brought in. They will butcher the meat to order and give you salami or hot dogs as well.    Apparently before guy fieri had been here there were only four people working here. Now it was over fifty people.   Everyone was super nice and friendly.   I also had a chance to meet the owner who was working out back. You'd never guess he was the owner. Totally down to earth and just a nice guy.   I can't wait to go back.   Oh the peach cobbler was good. But remember you're there for the meat.",

I couldn't exactly pick out what the u inquest flavor was but trust me...you haven't ever had anything like it before. Perfect is the word that keeps coming to mind when trying to explain it.

It was well worth the drive!!!! The BBQ here is so tasty and tender!!! The sides were just as amazing!!! I could not decide what I wanted to try so we got the 3 meat combo ( ribs, brisket, and pulled pork) that came with 2 sides. I chose baked beans ( this was so delicious, I wished I ordered a gallon!!!) and Mac n cheese. BBQ sauce came on the side, you can pick from hot or mild. I like the idea of the sauce on the side so I could put as little or as much as I wished!!! It also came with a moist delicious corn bread. I also got a side of hot links and apple cobbler. ALL of this cost me $25 and the portions are so huge that it fed 2 people and had left overs!!!! I got mines to go and the gave me a packet that came with a cute checker board napkin, utensils, salt n pepper, wet nap, and a business card with their info on it!!!! My tastebuds were finally satisfied after a failed BBQ experience a few days before!!! If you have not been here, I highly suggest you try it!!!! Your tastebuds and wallet will thank you!!!",

My personal recommendation is to get the cut up hot links, pulled chicken or pork and brisket or tri tip with mac n cheese and the yams or baked beans.  The hours are Monday to Saturday from 11a-6p and there is usually a line but it is so worth the wait.  I discovered this gem about 7 years ago and go when I'm craving BBQ but sometimes pick up meat to cook myself. They have been on diners, drive in and dives but more importantly they have been here in Vegas as a butcher / meat supply for over 75 years. Also, if you're a hunter, you can bring your kill to be cut and processed which is just another service they offer.",

Brisket is tough dry and bland, eat your belt instead.  Mac and cheese is worse than box made. Greens are boiled beyond all flavor. Cornbread is not bad, but utterly forgettable.  I would advise calling ahead and picking up burnt ends, otherwise stay away from this place.  If Guy Fieri eats here, you KNOWS it is nothing but carp.

The process, was kind of long standing in the line and all that jazz. But once in they were all busy bees! All the food was pretty good once we sampled it...HOWEVER, the buffet style, with food sitting inside the warming table, kind of dashed my vision of what I saw them eat when Triple D taped an episode. I have definitely had better barbeque and it is in my opinion that John (which I met and is sooo cool) probably should not par boil the ribs if they will be sitting in the warming trays. It loses all smoke flavor and texture. For the money, and the portions, this place is still a GOOD EAT!",

I don't know the history of the place, but it looks like a neighborhood lot was transformed into a small industrial meat smoking ranch.  So the place is rather busy at times.  It does take a while to order.  Everyone is friendly and just about everyone will greet you.  There is no place to sit but outside.  There are tons of covered benches with water sprayers everywhere to keep the place cool.  At times I actually felt like I was in Hawaii, getting hit with gentle drizzles of rain!  Bathrooms are also clean, and surprisingly air-conditioned!  Onto the food... For the price, you get A LOT of food.  Seriously, what a great value for your money.  I had a brisket & rib tip plate.  The brisket was soft and tender, though not my favorite type of preparation.  There was very little seasoning on the brisket, and it did need the BBQ sauce (which I might add was EXCELLENT).  I would have preferred a more smokey meat cut thicker with a bark, but all in all it was good.  The rib tips though were awesome.  Nice bark, not burnt, good seasoning and chew on them.  So good.  Rib tips by far were my favorite!  Sides were decent.  Cornbread, beans, and yams all pretty typical.  The star here is really the meats.  I will be back to try other samplings... Excellent and unique place.  Worth the drive, worth every penny!",

I was very pleased by how nice the staff was, since I had a few questions when I walked in.  I decided to try the ribs, brisket, and hot link, with a side of mac & cheese and potato salad.  I was thinking that there would be an inside area to eat because lets face it, it was hot outside.  There was no inside seating, but there were a few benches on the outside which had misters.  I could tell that majority of the locals who came in just picked their food up and left, but since my hotel was on the strip and that was a 20-25 minutes drive, I didn't want to wait.  This is the type of place that I enjoy going to, since it worked as buffet line and you would inch you way closer to the exit by the time you received your food.  I will come back to this place whenever I'm in the area!",

The first time we went it was during a week day. This time around it's Saturday! Oh my gosh the line was over 20 ppl deep! It took at least half hour to actually get our food! We decided to get the beef tips,with shredded chicken and they gave use two ribs on them. The sides we agreed on were, collard greens,macaroni and cheese and beans. BBQ sauce and corn bread comes with it. It was enough to feed two for 25bucks. Most definitely worth it! Not to mention how beautiful it was outside! Oh and don't let me forget, we even got a free sample of a rib they are testing the waters with while standing in line! I say go,go go!!!!",

We pulled into the parking lot and walked up greeted by an employee that was extremely nice and opened the door for us. Upon entering the food linw had a few people in it. Seemed like locals that knew what they wanted. Another gentleman came up and took our order to speed up the process. The line behind us grew significantly longer. We got to the register and bought a few shirts a well. The girl at the register was also very helpful. We walked outside and got a seat. We instantly struck up a conversation with some local Military Veterans about food and football. As we got into the food the smell of smoke permeated the air. I ordered the 3 meat combo, brisket, rib tips, and chicken with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese. Wife got chicken and green beans. Son ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Everything was done extremely well! Nothing over cooked or bland. I tend to like a big smoke flavor but my family doesnt. All the food was just right! We were all in aww over the layout and food. We were about midway through eating the owner(who i recognized) came up and asked how we liked it. As we described our experience got a HUGE smile on his face. He was happy and very passionate about his legacy! We told him we were visiting from Arizona and how its been on our list for years. His enthusiasm made our experience even better! I want to thank ALL OF THE STAFF that works at this place! You are a great group of people! THANK YOU CHUCK AND THE LEGACY YOU HAVE! WE WILL BE BACK!",

I first watched them slice the Bacon to order on their one-and-only Meat Slicer.  No problems yet.  But then, silently, I watched in horror as they pulled out a huge uncut length of Bologna and proceeded to slice it on the same Meat Slicer.  No cleaning, no warning.  Just good old fashioned raw bacon smeared all over each side of thick cut Bologna.  Who knows what else they cut on that one contaminated Meat Slicer.  Cheese?  Other lunch meat?  I love watching the camaraderie of the staff and the genuine joy on the faces of each patron who crowds into the butcher room.  Two stars because this is still the greatest place on the North Side to get steaks but please get out of the Stone Age with your processes.",

What peaked our interest with this joint was that we seen it on Diners Drive in's and Dives a few years ago so we decided to take the trek across Vegas to go there. The place seemed pretty authentic and all although I was not very impressed with the overall quality of food. The beef brisk tasted like boiled meat the rib tips were cold and tuff as rawhide and here we are 8 hours later and I am still burping up the sausage which is actually really gross. My fiance got the quarter chicken diner and it was seriously cold. The only positive thing about this place was that the place was clean and the staff was friendly. In the future we will most likely go to the Rollin Smoke BBQ located conveniently right off the strip by approx 1/2mile.",

On our first visit we stood in line for about 20 min to order then another 20 after we paid when we overhead the grill cook tell one of the line prep guys that they were out of ribs, rib tips, brisket, and chicken.  Since we ordered three of the four, we asked for a refund and they were very nice about it and also gave us free meal cards for our wait and the inconvenience.   That helped us decide to make the 60 mile round trip journey a second time.  I was amped to try this great BBQ after all the positive reviews I read and am sad to say I was disappointed. The sauce comes from big Smart & Final jugs which is surprising.  Neither the spicy or regular sauce were very good.  The cole slaw had a very off putting sour taste. The cornbread was just okay, as was the pulled pork, but nothing I would come back for.  However, I very much enjoyed the hot link.  For me that was the shining star of my Styrofoam box.  The BF had the ribs and found those lacking as well as the mac salad, which was not very good.  I do not think we will be coming back to this establishment.",

It's in a neighborhood, but google maps was precise in getting us there.",

They still butcher game and it's neat to see it. The food is delicious. I always get ribs and hot links. Whole hot links for me, but friends love the sliced links in sauce. Mac n Cheese is great, macaroni salad is really solid too. The place seems very clean and the employees all seem proud of the place. I only wish they had fountain drinks, but that's a small price to pay.",

The brisket wasn't cooked enough and wasn't cut against the grain, which also made it tough, good flavor though. The hot links in BBQ sauce was awesome.  The BBQ sauce was a little chunky with onions which I really liked and had the perfect tartness. We also got a pulled pork sandwich.  The pulled pork had a lot of flavor.  The sides were also good. Cheesy Mac and cheese, good potato salad, and the baked beans had a lot of flavor as well as lots of bacon and ground beef. The coleslaw was okay, too much celery seed which made it bitter.   If you like BBQ this is a must.",

After seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives, my family and I wanted to taste some authentic bbq while staying in Vegas. Unbeknownst to us, we arrived at the restaurant at 6 (which is the time they closed on Wednesday's). The staff did not even THINK about turning us away (because they were closing), but surprisingly offered to serve us despite our late arrival! Even with their generous hospitality, we decided to decline the offer because we did not want to bother them further. They gladly referred us to their other location, which is about 8 miles north and closes at 9. And to top it all off, they gave us samples to try before we left: customer service beyond the norm. P.S. they have amazing bbq too :D",

He pointed us in the direction of John Mulls Roadkill Grill. \"OMG\", this place is amazing. There was a line outside the door because you couldnt possibly fit anymore customers inside. To the right was cold meats where you place your butcher order, everything from bacon, pig jowls, and even deer meat in the fall. The people knew the customers by name, and if you spent $60 you got a free flat of eggs. We ordered rib tips, brisket, and pulled pork, with potatoe salad, and baked beans, and also peach cobbler. The food is so amazing, I would even consider trying the deer meat in the fall, when the cooks are this good why not? The customer service is like great customer service used to be when owners cared, and employees were happy. I could go on and on, but I'll just show let the pictures wrap this review up.",

So my order was taken and everything was fine then I got to the grille and was greeted with a hand out (no verbal greeting or smile) then asked to step around to receive my food. So automatically my mood switched because I would never allow my employees to act in such a way I coach those behaviors as soon as I see them. Then on top of that the lady got the order wrong stating she thought it said something that it wasn't. I'm not sure what the issue is but I've been here SO MANY TIMES and the customer service is always welcoming and that is how John is ALWAYS. I don't know but customer service is huge for me especially in this heat but the food is amazing as usual.",

First time was a whole gaggle of baby back ribs, got so much they threw in a whole case of eggs.  I was skeptical at first when the ribs looked like they were vacum packed and I didn't see them slice them up in front of me.  When I got them home though I knew these were hand cut and no Costco rebranded stock.  Nice and meaty and they qued up perfectly.  Second time was for probably my most pricey meat purchase to date, a 4 rib prime rib roast.  All you have to do is check out the pic I posted and I won't have to go any further with my review.  Nice and friendly people.  They have everything you need for serious barbecue enthusiasts except the charcoal.  Lamb, Duck, Geese, Deer, all cuts of the hog and cow...I hear the bacon is good so I'll have to go back for that one of these days.  LOCATION! LOCATION! locations?

It's in a residential area, so the drive there was a little strange, but that was soon replaced by great food. We got chicken, hot links, brisket and pulled pork with sides. The macaroni and cheese is the BOMB! I'm not a huge fan of bbq sauce, but I really liked the one they put on their meats. I had the hot link and it was delicious and spicy, but not too hot. The people that work there are fantastic and have great charisma and customer service. We visited the meat shop while were there and their products in there are just as good as their bbq outside. My husband and I will definitely return for more!",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better BBQ spots in Vegas which isn't saying much because Vegas does not have much of a BBQ scene.  As you drive down Thorn Blvd, you'll think you made a wrong turn but as your turn into the place you'll find a small ranch which provides a great atmosphere to your bbq eating experience.  You place your order and then walk to the BBQ station where they fill your orders...very cool.   I like the small bench setups....feels very Rudy's like (if you're from Texas)     The portions are very hearty.   I shared a 3 meat combo which consisted of 2 orders of ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and green beans.   The pulled pork was pretty dissapointing - very sweet and tasted like rou song (taiwanese dried pork that you put on top of rice).   The star of the show is definitely the ribs.   Excellent flavor and very tasty with the spicy bbq sauce.   The texture was perfect and had the perfect bite....not tough and over cooked.   I prefer a little more char smokiness but overall taste and flavor was delish.  I hope to come back to try their Trip Tip, brisket, and bbq chicken.  The mac n cheese was really good.  Green beans pretty soggy but good flavor.    It's a very neat place and if i would definitely make the trek up for their ribs.  Be sure to check out the meat market next door to get some electic meats!",

I'm going to miss you so much. Nita you are amazing! So let me tell you how the people of John Mulls treated me for the holidays. So, I didn't have a turkey a ham or any sides. I came to John Mulls and they made my Thanksgiving dinner possible. The owner, Nita melted my heart. Because of them, I was able to give my family a full meal. As a high school teacher and a mother of three, my time is so limited. My family came into town and I had no dinner prepped for all of them...so embarrassing. So, when I came to them they showed me so much love, I couldn't even believe it. So best believe my Christmas, Easter, Mother's Day, Fourth of July and Thanksgiving will be all John Mulls Road Kill. Oh by the way, all of Los Angeles has gotten the word because my mother has told everyone; the church, her co-workers, her neighbors and her little Facebook friends. I love this place and they will forever be my FAMILY and they will always have my heart!",

Thanks to Guy Fierri, people come near and far to try the best Vegas has to offer.  This is a very simple joint. Outdoor dining only. Their brisket, links, pulled pork, ribs and tri-tip(only on Tuesdays and Thursdays) are insanely good. My little one digs their mac n cheese. Green beans, potato salad and baked beans are my favorite sides and their peach cobbler is very addictive.  We were lucky enough to enjoy their free beer Saturdays until it got scrapped not too long ago due to a complaint from some bar nearby losing business (boo!).  Chuck, the owner is very low key. You'll see him grilling or at the meat shop.  Just a tip...get there before 1145am. The line could get very long.",

It's the farthest I've ever driven to any food place, I'm relieved it was worth the trip!!!  The food was insanely good, i never had pulled chicken until now, and it was the best thing I ate better than the Pulled Pork if you can believe that.    I ordered the Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, the famous Hot Link.  The BBQ baked beans, Mac&Cheese and corn bread were the sides. was awesome!!!  I never said this about any other BBQ place, but the I feel the sides were a huge complement for the main food even made it taste better. Based on my experience, from other establishments, I usually end up having great main dish/mediocre sides and vise versa thankfully that did not happen here.   I only had to wait a 25 minutes in line, so it wasn't to bad.  I would suggest calling beforehand just to make sure how busy it is especially on Saturdays. The price point ($18 for three meats and two sides) was reasonable based on quality.  I've paid that amount from other places and its not nearly as good.   This is one of those you must check out for yourself!",

Both were equally busy although a line steadily grew as the lunch hour came and went on Friday. There is really only enough room for a handful of people to get inside. The line extends down the building in the burgeoning Vegas heat. Get there early for lunch!  Menu boards tell you all you need to know: one, two or three meat combos featuring typical smoked delicacies with choice of sides. Portions are large for the reasonable price. I tried the pulled chicken (awesome) and rib tips (savory), beans (exquisite - if that be said about beans) and slaw. Some of my compatriots tried the triple meat and were defeated. BBQ sauce is smokey or sweet-heat. Both excellent! Corn bread was good as well!  A couple of servers take orders and hand them in at the counter. Your name is called and order confirmed as it is portioned into a take away container. This process is actually smooth and efficient plus you get a chance to interact with the staff who all seem to have a great sense of humour!  Meal and drink in hand, head outside again to one of the covered eating areas and prepare to dig in!   As previously described, food was delicious and, of course, all together too much! Caution: Meat Coma Inducing!!  Worth the short drive from the strip! Get there!!",

It's definitely off of the beaten trail, a hidden gem indeed. There was a line when we arrived, but everyone was so friendly...you just talked to folks while waiting. We went for lunch and sampled the chicken, pulled pork, collard green, potato salad and beans. Beans were a too sweet, pork and chicken moist but not super tender. Big disappointment was the beef rib which turned out to be something like smoked London broil, there was no bone... The ambiance and service was OK, prices fair, but don't go if you have ever eaten good Texas barbecue. Not bad, but not great either...",

Was greeted by the entire staff on the way in, lady at the front of the butcher (didn't catch her name) was extremely friendly. \"everyday is a good day\" she said. I assume she wasn't a vegetarian.....   Chuck cut me two 1\" slabs of ribeye, which I brought home, seasoned, and seared. The result?!? Let's just say my mouth is still drooling from last night. Delicious!   Will definitely go there again and recommend it to all my friends.",

They're personable and sweet. We came back 2 days in a row...and Kim remembered our orders! Although...there's a guy in the kitchen who was hating on my LA Kings Jersey...get rid of that one! lol.  In all seriousness...the food is PHENOMENAL, the service to top notch, and the outdoor seating is great even in the winter because they've got outdoor heaters. This is quickly turning into my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  Give it a try and see for yourself. If you like BBQ, you will love this place!",

The food was bbq just right full of flavor and the sides brinf you back to when your family has a reunion and the elders put their soul in the food! The ribs were tender and fell off the bones the brisket and links were delish! The mac n cheese had the right balance of cheese to noodle ratio. The yams take you back to thanksgiving dinner. The baked beans and potato salad made you wanna do a happy dance. My only dislike was there was no place to eat in doors and it was over 100 out but i guess its not traditional if ya eat it indoors. And to me if the only complaint is no indoor seating they are doing something right",

Now they've also upgraded their outdoor seating and added some outdoor heaters for cooler days and more canopies to hide from the sun on the hot days.  I love barbecue and I've tried finding comparable food closer to home (in the south) and I have not been successful. You also get a TON of food for about $15. To get this much food at any of the other BBQ places I've been to in Vegas, it has been more than twice that amount. There's a lot of good BBQ in Vegas but this is the best I've found, and the staff is always friendly. Definitely check it out.",

Lots of yummy choices on the grill.... sandwiches and plates...  Here's the link to their menu (picnic style):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjohnmullsmeats.com%2Fimage%2Fdata%2Fpdfs%2FJohn%2520Mull%27s%2520Road%2520Kill%2520Grill%2520Menu%252008-15-12.pdf&s=54c302d200bcec28349871d2233af90815fbfcb8871a95521a18dd8da022f339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">johnmullsmeats.com/image...</a>  Plan on outdoor eating... they have some tables under shade... some are not.  So, it's wise to wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen.    Their area is gravel/dirt so dress appropriately. They have 2 parking areas on either side of their grill area.  The Meat Market/Butcher Shop is AWESOME!   You can get all kinds of different meats and cuts.  You can specify the thickness of the cuts you order too.  And if you order over $50 ... you get a FREE flat of farm fresh eggs.  (Did you know a flat of eggs is 24?!)  We didn't realize we were getting this and we were unprepared for it.  Oh well... got home safe with all eggs in tact.   For lunch I ordered the Brisket Sandwich.... it's brisket on a roll.  I should re-phrase..... LOTS of brisket on a roll.  I took 1/2 home.  The meat is super moist and tender and flavorful.  Not salty tasting.    I also got a side of mac salad.  It's pretty good.  It was made with the little round macaroni pasta noodles.... not the elbow ones.... it was a little mayo-y and sweet for me.  I prefer the kind that has some mustard flavor to it.  But still this one was solid not store bought.  The husband got the 2 plate meat... it came with 2 sides... he got brisket and hot links with cole slaw and potato salad.  The cole slaw was a bit runny and I didn't care for it.  I like cole slaw that is crisp and crunchy and I think because they have to pre-make so much of it that it sits in the dressing too long.  The potato salad was Really Good..... Get the Potato Salad.  :)  The Hot Links had a bit of \"hotness\" to it but not super spicy/hot.... they had good texture and great flavor.  I think these would make a Great Hot Dog.  :)   We will totally be back.  :)  Note: closed on Sundays",

HOWEVER, you want to know just how much they appreciate their guest ~~ first each person is treated special ALL THE TIME, but yesterday, they went O. V. E. R. THE TOP!! First week back to work and yesterday, what was I craving ~ but ~ I had forgot they closed at 6. I don't get off now until 6 now, so I'm DEVASTATED!!  But I got there yesterday say about 6:07 ~ another woman arrived at the same time. Of course she could move faster than me and by the time I got mid way to the door, she was walking back. I'm like oh no, please tell me they are not closed. She was like yep, sign says 6. I'm like, no, did you try the door {in my very desperate voice}? She says no, let's go try the door.  Yep clossssssed  BUT, the Angel owner sees us, and let's us go in.  Now, his TEAM, was tired and trying to clean up and go home. You'd never know it. Those same smiles, that same politeness and being helpful ~~~ ALWAYS THE BEST!! I LOVE  YOUR TEAM SO MUCH!! And guess what, I'm back!!!",

The only thing that sucks is that you have to wait in a long line to order. Like 40 minutes and it's hot... Other than that A+!",

The line can get pretty long but the service goes fairly quickly. You give your order at the counter and then walk down to the grill. I love seeing everything being cooked. The smell is incredible. It is a lot of food. My husband and I split the two meat meal and it was more than enough for both of us. The brisket and the pulled chicken are great. The brisket has a great flavor and just falls apart in your mouth. The pulled chicken is smothered in a flavorful BBQ sauce. For sides we had cornbread, potato salad and mac and cheese, all of which were fantastic. I really recommend this place!",

    "text": "OMG OMG can I just say OMG!   My Fiance and I had the bright idea to host our first Thanksgiving together inviting all our friends over. Neither one of us liked the idea of getting up before the crack of dawn to cook a Turkey.   After a brief debate as who would be cooking the bird I convinced her into giving a Smoked Turkey from John Mulls a try.   It was the best decision we ever made. The Fiance was worried that we were going to have a dried out rubbery bird due to it sitting out in a smoker and then an hour in the oven but let me tell you we didn't have a dried piece of meat on the entire Bird! The Smokey flavor went throughout the bird and every piece was juicy and delicious.  The shop itself is kinda cramped for a crowd but as long as you avoid mad holiday rushes like Thanksgiving you will be fine just don't open the door to fast as you may knock someone out.  My last trip there the Road Kill grill was outside grilling on an open spit and it was all I could do not to drop the Turkey and run over to the grill and buy one of everything on the menu it smelled so good!  Thank you for a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and I will definitely be back soon. In fact I highly recommend you beat me there.",

    "text": "There should be 2 separate listings, because I had significantly different experiences between the Road Kill Grill and the butcher services, so I am averaging here. First the grill: Dirt lot, outdoor picnic tables and a non-descript entrance that had me looking around to see if I had the right spot all point to a great dive-style BBQ joint.  I went at a time I expected to be off-peak, but the line was still rather long and everything made me feel THIS was going to be a great meal.  However, when you go to a dive for food and the food isn't good, all of the romance of eating at a dive disappears and you realize it's really just a dumpy spot that is surviving on the hype. Maybe it was an off day, but my ribs were dry.  The meat had a nice smoky flavor and were still tender enough to eat, but they had been on the heat too long and lacked anything special. Both of the side dishes I chose were disappointing.  I ate the beans, but they were rather bland.  I tried both their spicy and regular BBQ sauce, but nether offered much help.  The coleslaw was unpleasant and after only two bites, thrown away.  And how do you ruin coleslaw?  I was surprised by that. While I was there, I did look at the selection of meats they offer from the butcher-side of the business and was very excited to see some offerings that are hard to find anywhere else in Summerlin.  By watching the action while I was in line, I was impressed.  The meat looked great and the guy handling it obviously knew what he was doing.  I picked up some random beef cuts for later and the flavor was excellent.  This kept them from getting only 2 stars for the food, because I would go back to use their butcher services in the future, but will never try the BBQ again.",

The brisket in the past has been so tender you did not need a knife  to cut it while today it was tough and fatty; could hardly cut it with a knife.  It was also cold as were the ribs which also lacked flavor.  The collard greens, mac and cheese and cornbread however were delicious and the staff as usual were extremely friendly.  I hope that we just hit Roadkill on a bad day.",

The taste of the meat is really good, but just way too hot for me.  Would love them without the spice.  As for sides, the BEST, way beyond all the others, is the Mac N Cheese.  For me, there is no other side.  The baked beans are WAY TOO spicy and the coleslaw just doesn't taste that good...same goes for the potato salad.  Just go for double Mac N Cheese for your sides...would highly recommend RKG for some great BBQ and they also cater your parties...we've done that as well and it was a BIG hit.  Just be warned that you'll have so much food leftover if you use their # of people guidelines for ordering...just order less than what you think you'll need...ENJOY!",

    "text": "I am not a big BBQ eater when I go out to eat.  All of the chains I've been to just don't live up to a good home BBQ'ed meal.  I am pretty sure their motto is \"skimp on the meat because they can't taste it through our 'award winning' BBQ sauce!\"  John Mull's puts these chains to shame and lives up to any claims about being as good as home BBQ!  The place itself resides on a small ranch and has that Old Nevada feel to it.  As a native to this state, I love that about the location.  A dirt parking lot and old wooden fences/structures make me feel like I am on a Nevada road trip.  There is a small out door seating area, but I prefer to take my food over to the Tenaya Creek brewery and have a nice IPA with my BBQ... SO GOOD!  So far I have had the brisket, the ribs, a little bit of pulled pork and chicken.  This place has the best brisket I have ever had!  The stuff sits in it's own juices all day, and is incredibly tender and juicy.  \"Wow\" is all I can say about the brisket after hating this cut from other places.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Just amazing stuff.  Same goes for the pulled pork and chicken, although the pulled pork is a bit on the salty side.  The BBQ sauce has a thick, lightly sweet quality to it.  I prefer the spicy one (it's not that spicy).  But you really don't need BBQ sauce at all.  That is how good the meat is.  The dry rub kicks the crap out of every place I've been to.  All of the sides are amazing as well.  The only thing I am not a big fan of are the desserts, but that doesn't matter to me because the \"dinner\" portions are so huge that you won't have room for dessert anyway.  Really the dinners are enough for two maybe even three people with that brisket.  Folks, seek this one out.  Take it from a guy that doesn't do Generic Dave's Memphis Subpar BBQ, The BBQ is outstanding here.",

While they were packing my catering order, they went over every items with me twice to ensure I received everything I ordered.  I couldn't get over how awesome this place smelled. After my order was loaded in my car, I parked and went in to get some food to go. The smell did it. Let me tell you, it was heaven.  Meat seasoned and cooked to perfection. Side dishes were perfect. I am running out of adjectives! It's one of those places you have to try for yourself.  Btw- the catering  meals were top notch. I WILL be back.",

I am glad I do not live by it because I would eat it every day!! I had the two meat combo; brisket and ribs with a double side of Mac n cheese.  The brisket and ribs were tender, juicy, smokey, and perfectly seasoned with their rub.  It was so good that you almost did not need their own freshly made BBQ sauce that comes in mild or spicy.  Their BBQ is dry rubbed and smoked, the sauce is more of a side condiment.  The Mac n cheese was some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant.  This place is super highly recommended and one which I plan on returning too many times.  They also do catering and have an exotic meat market where you can buy just about any cut of meat you can think of.",

I inquired about the type of jerky they were making and he striked up a conversation and gave me and my lunch partner a free sausage stick to try.  We left out the back door where the smokers are and they gave us a tour and showed us the food.  The food was outstanding due to them utilizing real wood in their smokers.  Most places utilizes commercial smokers but not here.  This is traditional BBQ which makes it the best! I will return again soon and with more guests to have this great experience!!",

Now be forewarned, this isn't a place to come to with a large group of people to actually eat here. You are supposed to order your food and take it home as they really don't have much seating area.  As for the food, wow, I ordered just the hot links sandwich, and the sauced version of the hot links blew me away. The portions are large and the price is fair.  If you are tired of going to Lucilles, Famous Daves, Tony Romas ribs, and other chains, then come here and try this place out! True southern-like BBQ house.

    "text": "My fiance and I were in Vegas for a few days and we really wanted to go here after seeing the restaurant features in a rerun on TV a few days before.  It isn't as tricky to find as the reviews on here made us believe.  There are clearly marked signs of where to go, it's just kind of awkward to turn into someone's back yard to go eat lunch.  Anyway, the staff was very nice.  We had a good conversation with them while they prepared the food.  This was probably my favorite service while we were in Vegas.  As far as the food.  We got the 3 meat platter with sausage, brisket, and pulled pork.  For sides, we got mac n cheese and baked beans.  Sausage was as good as advertised, very tasty.  Pork was also terrific, little bit of spice and very enjoyable.  Brisket didn't tickle our fancy, but we aren't really brisket people.  Mac n cheese and baked beans were both very good.  The one platter was more than enough for us to share.  Seriously, the portions are huge.  Great value.  The main reason that I gave this place 4 stars was that they didn't make their own sauce(s).  I saw them using big jugs of Sams club BBQ sauce on the ribs.  There's something to be said for how good this place is despite not even making its own sauce.  I know, it started off as a butcher shop, so the main emphasis of the place is on the meat, not the sauce.  But sauce is a big percentage of barbecue.   Very good place to go.  If you've got a rental car and want to spend a little time off the strip, this is a really easy drive for some good food.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

The whole beauty of the place is that  it's hidden away in a neighborhood and only the people that have heard about a great this place is can find it.. Someone actually wrote a negative review saying it was overcrowded... Hey idiot !! It's overcrowded because the food is so damn good!!  Use ur brain!  The Mac n cheese best I've ever had period. The meats to die for.. Best BBQ you will find here in Vegas period....",

The ribs were out of this world. He had pulled pork and chicken. I had a combo which included brisket. Just tasty as all heck. The price is very reasonable as you don't pay for atmosphere, just great food. You eat at outdoor picnic tables and the patrons clean up after themselves. It seemed like customers were courteous about doing that. We went on a Saturday, and they offered free ice cold beer in a barrel. Can't beat that! Seemed like most of the customers I chatted with were from out of town. Hard to believe us locals have overlooked this place.",

Walked in front door and bumped someone on the other side was bumping elbows with customers. Awesome place person at counter takes your order and behind them is some guy cutting your meat. Real friendly staff while I was waiting for my cut they busted out a block of Colby cheese and sliced about 2 lbs to give to all of us customers to try wife and I bought 3 lbs of the stuff. I bought 2 tri-tip roasts, good cut of meat good fat amount took home and grilled Santa Maria style. I will be coming back for sure. I love to smoke meat will be getting my ribs both pork & beef, pork butt, & other meats, next time I go back will be getting a 14 lbs brisket. Forgot, prices are real competitive with super markets around town",

I would have to say the brisket and mac salad were my favorite. The free beers while waiting is the 5 star maker :)",

    "text": "OK, NEVER, NEVER GO HERE ON THE 1st OF THE MONTH!  I made the fatal mistake of going yesterday to pickup a small amount of meat for a BBQ on Labor Day.  When I drove up I noticed so many people outside just sitting around. and I thought maybe they were there to eat, a party maybe?  When I got the door open the place was jammed, and I do mean jammed packed!  I should have left right then and there!  But being a die hard fan of John Mull's I decided with what I needed shouldn't take too long.  What I didn't know was that all these people were getting a month's supply of meat because on the first of the month the food stamps come through.  Dumb me thought they were just getting meat for Labor Day parties!  The orders everyone were placing were HUGE, and each order needed the meat cut, wrapped and boxed.  Some people said they had been there for over 4 hours!  Now, their meat is good, but to stand around in the heat for hours, it's not that good!  I thought how long could my measly order take?  So I waited, slid, and pushed my way to the counter.  Why they don't have a TAKE A NUMBER system I have no idea, but they sure could use one.    Anyway, when I placed my order instead of just wrapping the meat and letting me pay for it,  she wrote down my order of 2 items and put it in the pile with the rest of the huge meat orders.  I decided to get some sides to go with the meat so shouldered my way to the \"hot plate\" side of the room and got some potato salad, beans, and mac and cheese.  THEIR SIDES ARE AMAZING!  I proceeded to wait about another hour and finally said I'm outta here because that's a long enough wait for anything and I have a hard time standing with these legs!  The staff was working as fast as they could go, people waiting were really nice about the situation, but it still didn't help the fact that I couldn't stand there with my potato salad in one hand and my cane in the other!  Will I go back to John Mull's?  You better believe it - just never, never on the first of the month!",

Some of the best pulled pork and brisket ever as well. Larry was the best making sure we had a fresh serving of potato salad and generous helpings of everything. Kim on the cash was so helpful letting me know how to order dog bones for my 2 dogs as well. Make sure you try the Mac and cheese! It's so good you will feel guilty!  It was about a thirty minute from southwest corner of the city but well worth it in my opinion!  See you guys again soon!  Larry I told you I would write a review :) !",

Had the pulled pork and the brisket and they both were incredible.  The side dishes were mac n cheese and baked beans and they both were great as well.  The bbq sauce was good but the meat was so moist and juicy that you didn't need any sauce.  I only wish they served beer, but besides that I have no complaints.  Thought Lucille's was decent bbq but this place kills Lucille's.  Definitely plan on going back and taking friends.",

I am going to go with a 3 star rating because this place I found to be average.  It took me a while to actually get here because they close so doggone early.  They close at 6:00 and I don't usually make it to the area from work until nearing 6:00.  So I usally have to bypass it.  And Saturdays are just too busy.  Sundays they are closed.  I did make it in one time though right before closing time.  I placed my order for a plate of brisket with baked beans and macaroni salad.  The beans were good but not extraordinary.  The macaroni salad was really good.  I am not alway a fan of macaroni salad but I ate this and wanted more.  As for the meat of the plate, the brisket itself, it was good.  Tender.  Flavorful.  They gave me a pile of it on top of a dinner roll.  I was disappointed that it did not come with BBQ sauce.  I came home and put some sauce from The Bear Pit (see review) on it.  That made it so much better.  I saved some of the meat for the next day.  There was that much of it.  With the amount of food I received, I felt the price was fair.  The reason they don't get a 4 star rating from me is the operating hours (which I understand and respect given they are in a residential neighborhood).  And the food, while good, it not amazing.  I would like to go back and get some of the fresh meat (uncooked) from their butcher side of business.",

Everything is precooked, and sitting in trays waiting for order/delivery.  We finally made it through the wait (20-30min), and was pleasantly surprised to feel the WEIGHT in our food box!  Had to be a couple pounds of food here!  Eva and I shared the 3 Meat / 2 sides Combo ($16): BBQ Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Mac N Cheese & Potato Salad.  We weren't able to finish barely HALF of the food!  Ribs were excellent! Tender and full of smokey flavor, but ate them dry since we weren't given any BBQ sauce.  MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR BBQ SAUCE!!!  The Brisket was served wet...just not very tender and missing the smoke flavor I love elsewhere in town. The pulled pork was ok but not mentionable.   However, they EXCELLED in sides! One of the BEST Mac N Cheese versions I've had, with lots of melted cheese and charred bits from the burner! I'd come here again for the ribs and mac personally!  Finished off with the Peach Cobbler...just ok. Kinda soupy/goey without any crust.  Pass!   Be prepared to WAIT!  But the Ribs and Mac will be WORTH the wait...just not the other stuff IMO.",

They still gave us fresh food and good customer service even though it was 30 minutes prior to them closing. They didn't have enough ribs ready so they immediately put some more on the grill.  Their ribs tips were good and meaty. Hot links were juicy and drizzled on BBQ sauce. The hot BBQ sauce was delicious. The mac and cheese was very cheesy. The string beans was cooked with smoke turkey and seasoned just right.  The only thing I didn't like  was the cornbread was cold and they didn't offer slice bread with dinners. You truly do get your money's worth. With left overs that taste even better the next day. I will be back again.",

I ordered a 3-meat combo of brisket, chicken, and a hot link with a side of mac and cheese, potato salad, and cornbread. The brisket was easily the best I ever had, with a really good smokey flavor. I also enjoyed the chicken as well as the mac and cheese and the potato salad. I didn't really enjoy the hot link too much though. I found it too salty and the fact that they cook it on one side made it tough to bite through. Also the cornbread was essentially pre-made and wasn't very good as well.   Overall, though, I would gladly come back if given the opportunity. The food was good and the staff was nice and friendly. Just, if you can, eat inside your car if possible. The venue is outdoors and I got chased back to my car by a few bees that liked the food I had as well.",

    "text": "The hunt for great BBQ in Las Vegas brought me here and in some ways I was thrilled and some ways I was disappointed.  Went during lunch on a Thursday, the service seemed slow but it was because the line was deceptively short (aka there were a bunch of people ordering 3 things). Probably about 20-30 minutes from when I entered the line to when I got my food. There is lots of outdoor seating so staying and eating is always an option.  The sides I got were:  1. Cornbread - This was definitely a highlight, really good, right about of sweetness and moisture. Left me wanting more  2. Green Beans - Average, I accidentally got a side of this because the guy misread baked beans. Definitely good enough to get if you like green beans but nothing to write home about.  3. Baked Beans - Very much on point. Good mixture of sweet and savory with the right amount of meat. Good enough to eat a bowl of on your own.  4. Mac and Cheese - Really good, especially for most BBQ places. They made theirs with shells vs elbows which I think was a great choice. It's incredibly cheesy and unlike other places they actually seasoned it (which is what makes it really good).  5. Cole Slaw - I'm very torn by their slaw, it's probably a little undersauced to your traditional slaw. But as a result it gives a very refreshing light taste to it. Steer clear if you're preference is creamy, but I imagine it's a refreshing treat during hot Vegas summers.  And to the meat of the situation:  1. Brisket - This was pretty mediocre. The meat sits in juice/liquid before serving which kept it moist but ensured the flavor was pretty bland. Definitely preferable to a dry and chewy brisket, but prepare to sauce this one if you're a brisket fan. (Bark is almost none existent and I couldn't find a smoke ring, but BBQ fans know that's not everything)  2. Ribs - I'll be honest, these weren't great. Borderline \"eh\". They do give you a good helping of ribs which is pretty good value for price paid. Their prep on the ribs before service is just reheating on the grill, which to me is why they aren't that great. Generally they are kind of dry, don't really fall off the bone, and lack a strong flavor. I would pass unless you're just looking for good value for your money.  3. Pulled Pork - Definitely a good pulled pork. Probably more sauce than I'd like, but oversauced is better than undersauced with pulled pork, IMHO. Texture was consistent with a good pulled pork, a little on the sweet side on account of the sauce.  4. Hot Links - By far the winner in the meats I got. They really had a good balance of heat and flavor, most hot links I have sacrifice one for the other. The preparation is a reheat on the grill, and then they slice it up, so the appearance left me thinking it was almost yesterday's leftovers. That being said, they tasted great and had a right amount of accompanying sauce. If hot links are even remotely your thing, you won't be disappointed.  Sauces - They had two sauces at the end, X for hot, and no X for not. Both are pretty good but not something to write home about. The hot isn't really that hot for anyone who likes spice, but that's probably ideal for your casual spice person.  Side Note - They have tri tip on Tuesday and Thursday, I got there at about 12:30 on a Thursday and they were out.  Long story short, hit or miss on meat, sides are very solid, service is what you'd expect.",

You can place your food order over the phone from monday to friday. Saturdays you have to stand in line but it is always worth it. Their staff are very friendly and polite. They have free bottles of water while you wait. They also have live music on saturdays if you want to stay and eat there. I recommend this place.",

One note if it's near a Holiday, don't wait get your meat a few days early. This is a very popular spot, and the line can run out the door through the parking lot and onto the street!",

I had the pulled pork dinner. For $10.65 I had the best pulled pork I'd ever eaten. I had sides of collards (excellent) and potato salad (pretty darn good). The portions were generous. I tried both of their BBQ sauces: spicy & regular and I thought both were great. The spicy had a nice kick but wasn't too spicy and the regular and a really nice flavor, but wasn't overly sweet. If you want BBQ in Vegas, this is a place to go",

    "text": "There has been a whole lot of chatter in the work space recently about what was initially called the Road Kill Grill but what I now know is John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill ( not even gonna abbreviate this one).  I mark this day 09/26/13, a day of BBQ spiritual revival when several weeks of talk became a reality.  Not knowing what to expect, I listened to veterans prepare me as we went to all place, McDonalds. What the hell does Mickey D's have to do with this review?! I will tell you.  It was to pick up cheap beverages  prior to our arrival.  John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill has beverages allows you to bring whatever you like to drink.....more on that later.  I picked up my partner and he and I while driving north bound on Rancho, made a left on Gowan, and then a left on Thom to arrive at the Eden of Flame Cooked Protein.  You can't miss it from there.  As we pulled into the gravel parking lot, we both said to each other...\"What the F#$& is this place?\"  Surreal given it's been around since the 40's,, and who knows how many animals have given their lives to making meat eating people happy.  The group rallied up and we went inside.  The inside is a combination food line on the left and butcher shop on the right.  Given the atmosphere after seeing a stuffed coyote and and skull with small antlers ...Garett A. later said and I quote \"It's a man cave of meat.\"  With that said, you don't eat in the man cave, you dine outside.  On this particular outing, I ordered up a three meat combo consisting of the following:  Meats: Pulled Pork, Brisket, Tri-Tip (Tuesday & Thursday). Sides:  Baked Beans & Mac & Cheese.  When I picked up and paid for my chow ($20 w/ tip), I sat and ate in silence, trying to eat everything while it was still hot.    The meat was outstanding.  My favorite was the Tri-Tip.    The sides were outstanding.  Mac & Cheese was so damn cheesy.  The baked beans were hearty and not like the commercial grade can beans you get in a grocery store or someone's backyard BBQ.  The word around the gravel parking lot is John has free beer on Saturdays.  Nothing would be finer to complement the fantastic grub on a Saturday this a few barley sodas!  It is 11:11PM and I am still stuffed/satisfied from a truly glorious lunch.  I can't wait to go back.    Check it out!!!.... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtE6pyR2Tl5U&s=f1948ea31d9912b3cb59fbb11590676dc54791fbdd56f86055f1caf72e5460f9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=tE6p...</a>   It starts at 11:01",

    "text": "This review is for the Road Kill Grill section.  Looking for this place off of Thom Blvd, you can easily miss it if you are not looking hard enough. What's funny is that they have two decent sized signs and I still almost ended up passing them. You are actually in the middle of a neighborhood and all of a sudden you see several small ranch style buildings. It kind of looks like a western setting for an old cowboy movie.  Once you find the dirt/gravel parking lot, make your way to the building that says John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill. When you come in, the bulk meat ordering section is to your right while the hot food section is to your left. You tell the attendant behind the hot food counter what you want and they will put it in a to go container for you coming from pans that are already prepared.   What I ordered was the 2 meat combo for 14 dollars. The 3 meat was only 2 dollars more but damn, I know for sure I am not gonna finish the 2 meat. Meat choices were Hot Links, Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, 1/4 Chicken, Rib Tips, and Tri Tip on Tues and Thursday only. I chose the Brisket and Pulled Pork. Comes with your choice of 2 sides which were Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, Baked Beans, Green Beans, Cole Slaw, and Mac n Cheese. I opted for the Potato Salad and Mac n Cheese. If you refer to my picture, its a lot of food!  So when you pay towards the end of the counter, you have a choice of regular or spicy barbeque sauce in a little to go cup. I sampled both and the spicy was better than the original. Not make you sweat spicy, but just that little flavor kick to get you going. What's pretty cool is that they have the sauces in warmers so you get it heated.  Once you pay, you have the option of going home, staying in your car, or look for one of several tables outside to sit down and eat. Remember, the building you came from only houses the butcher meats and hot foods only.  Service is decent. From my assumption if the place is packed you will definitely have to wait a while. Of course you can call ahead and pick up also.  Some random info. Their bathroom is literally in the back where all their pits and smokers are so if you need to go you can probably catch the cooks in action. I suggest getting the 3 meat combo to share cuz its a lot of food and you can save money! The roads leading up to their place is all 25 miles per hour. On certain days, cops like to meet their quota by hanging out around this area so watch your speed!  So overall, they have some decent barbeque here. I just wouldn't make an extra special trip just to eat here though.",

It was President's day and this place does a great thing for their guests by putting a separate grill on for free hot dogs, burgers and fries for anyone who wants something to eat. next time I go I want to try the pulled pork.",

We got brisket, pulled pork, & hot links with mac-n-cheese, baked beans, & corn bread. We got a side of hot & mild BBQ sauce to try both. Mild was very good, hot was ok. Pulled pork was our favorite, it was very tender, flavorful. Hot links were pretty good. Not a fan of the brisket. Just bland. Both sides were good. Baked beans were better, mostly because we got end of a mac-n-chesse batch. Might have been incredible if it was fresh. Corn bread was delicious! Service was efficient & friendly enough.",

My most recent was when we had them cater for our company lunch. Best decision we had made in a very long time.  They set up in our parking lot and you could just smell the good food cooking away. We had ribs, chicken, brisket, sausage, mac & cheese, baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, peach cobbler, rolls and assorted BBQ sauces.  The mac & cheese is simply some of the best I have ever had. It was cheesy but not greasy. It was ooey and gooey and the perfect balance of flavors.  The baked beans! HOLY MOLY! I am not a big baked bean person but these beans were delicious. They were mixed with ground beef and a concoction of seasonings that just kept me wanting more.   Out of the meats, the spareribs were my favorite. They were tender and just delicious. The brisket was good too - juicy and smokey. The chicken was actually pretty good too. Not dry at all. The sausages, well who doesn't like a good old sausage.  There is never a reason to pass up on something this good. I promise. Good food, Great portions, Reasonable prices.",

Ask any BBQ pro about boiling ribs and they will look at you like you just stole their elderly mother's life savings.  John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated \"this is competition meat\".  So I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!  Opened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.  Anyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.  Thanks Guy!!!   I was at another restaurant and the owner claimed that Triple D requests a fee for them to visit your restaurant.   I believe that.  Have you ever seen Guy say \"that place was just OK'??",

Our sides were the mac and cheese and green beans.  The beans were slightly over cooked but had a really good flavor.  The ambiance of wild west Nevada ranch is awesome.  It was very fair weather today so we ate outside at one of the picnic tables.  The staff in the butcher area and at the Road Kill Grill are extremely friendly, upbeat and helpful.

The service is not always stellar, their always busy so it's not the fastest either. However, once you bite down into the ribs you just dipped in their home made bbq sauce nothing else will matter. It's the type of taste that will make you close your eyes, and just hum good stuff, and thoughts. Always go with the corn bread, I also recommend their macaroni as a side. You must try the ribs along with everything else on their menu, I heard you can get by without the chicken so I haven't tried it yet but I will next time.",

    "text": "Alright, so if you decide to come here, know off top that you are going to be waiting in a long ass line. Why? Because the food is that spectacular. Plus all that waiting just makes you more hungry for all the food that is about to come. The owner's son who gave us menus while we waited in line also took our order and was very apologetic about said wait. He had a great demeanor and was pretty easy on the eyes as well ;-) Now again, once you order, there is a bit of waiting till you finally get your food, but it is SOOO worth the wait. So when they say 'backyard bbq' here they are not kidding. Seating is outdoor picnic tables, folding tables and chairs, so wear sneakers/closed toe shoes to avoid looking like a tourist. I ordered the 2 meat combo with 1/4 chicken and ribs with mac & cheese and green beans. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and juicy, the ribs were fall-off-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS! You want some extra meat with your meat? Because there's meat in the green beans and it's the best thing to happen to green beans since melted butter. The mac & cheese was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdabomb.com&s=5b12954f4986dfef8bb4f5356c150e6c6f7a69d180e9f505ff2bc240349d8c81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dabomb.com</a> and the order came with a piece of soft/warm cornbread. Sodas are just $1 and besides the standards (Coke, sprite etc.) they also have Iced tea, lemonade, fruit punch and orange soda. Honestly I have not a single complaint about this place, they even threw in a piece of warm apple cobbler for free since we had to wait extra for our chicken to come off the grill and it was the stuff American Dreams are made of.",

Tues and Thurs are Tri-tip served on top of the other choices! The only negative is sometimes your server will take so long getting your order that it almost ruins the trip to come. Very consistent food if you like BBQ ribs, chicken, hot links and great sides like baked beans mac & cheese! In a totally residential area, it really makes you feel like you're in a backyard party!",

The brisket was in some sort of broth... what's that about? We are from Cincinnati and both love great bbq as we've had bbq 3 days in a row.

The location is a little jarring & will probably catch you off guard the first time you go- It's located in a 'not so nice' residential area in the middle of a dirt lot. But, if something little like that bothers you enough to not eat amazing ribs, then, so be it! But just know that you're missing out on some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Highly recommend the brisket or the hot links! Also, their mac n' cheese is probably the greatest gift to earth. All in all, the location is a good 30-40 minute drive from where I live but if I'm craving some good BBQ, it's totally worth the drive.",

Its tucked into a residential neighborood which adds to the hominess feel of the place.  The restaurant is a no frills butcher shop, but the smells are enough to get your mouth watering.  I went for the 3 meat combo with ribs, brisket and puled pork with mac and cheese and mac salad for sides.  The ribs were a little dry but the flavor was very good.  The rub was excellent and great smokey flavor, could have just been a bad day.  They offer 2 bbq sauces so I put the spicey sauce on the ribs and they were just fine.  The highlight was the brisket, it was tender and flavorful with no sauce needed.  the third meat was a pulled pork sandwich and it was great, this is one of those dishes that your average joe who isn't totally into bbq would love or kids.    We ordered the hot link sandwich and was surprised to find that it was a hot link on a bun with a side of hot links smothered in bbq sauce and both were excellent!  You get a great sausage flavor up front and then the heat follows up shortly.    The Mac and Cheese was the highlight of the trip for reason that most mac and cheese you find at bbq places are bland.  Their version was so good, there were different fresh cheeses and a baked top for that nice crispy cheese flavor.",

The sauce that they use is vinegary and sweet and is just a great fusion of flavors.   The ribs are fantastic, they give a little kick and are great without sauce, so if you like just a dry rub, you are in for a treat.   The one thing I always do is I try all the meats without sauce first because if they use a great rub, it will only be enhanced with the sauce.  And for dessert, you just can't go wrong with some warm peach cobbler.",

I'm thinking \"what the heck?\" If he took me at night no way would I have left the car!! So we proceeded inside because I'm in love and trust this man with my life for some strange reason. You order your combination plate and move down a line like a soup kitchen. Then once you pay you are ushered right out the back door. We sat at one of the picnic tables outside since it was a nice day. Man O man! This was some awesome grubbage! I'm still having dreams about the macaroni and cheese! My guy even snuck back on another day just to buy himself a jar of the BBQ sauce! Don't let the exterior fool you. This is the main place to go in Vegas for some BBQ!",

I have had lots of BBQ from Texas to Memphis and hands down this is the best BBQ in Las Vegas....I'd honestly compare this to True Memphis BBQ (Not the Memphis Championship BBQ here in town - which is crap), if they competed in Memphis in May, they would give some of the other BBQ guys a run for their money - including some of the restaurants like the BBQ shop and The Commissary !!   The meat is well prepared and has a True smoke flavor and the portion sizes are generous. The BBQ sauce has a bold flavor and the sides are just to die for!  Myself, I had the 5 rib platter with two sides - the ribs were so tender that they easily fell off the bone! I did double baked beans for my sides and were just off the hook! The flavor had a kick to it - not too hot nor spicy.   My wife had the rib/pulled pork combo. I ended up trying her pulled pork and it was just right! Not too tuff nor chewy - it honestly melted in your mouth! She did the baked beans as well as potato salad along with the Apple Cobbler....needless to say it was also as good as everything else!  I am not 100% sure where the one recent reviewer who rated this placed two stars is from but I have to strongly disagree with her review. I have spent time in Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee...with my wife being from Memphis, we are also frequently visiting some of the BBQ joints.   As for the meat market - I will review it later, we did pick up some ground beef to make burgers.   I am looking forward to visiting this place again soon!",

    "text": "We went here seeing that is was the best BBQ in Las Vegas according to Yelp. We ordered brisket, ribs, seasoned green beans, BBQ beans, mac n cheese, coleslaw and peach cobbler. If you buy a drink, it's served in a can.  The brisket was tender and juicy, but did not have a smoke ring, and was served sopping in its jus. It was cut with the grain instead of against the grain. The ribs were great, cooked just about perfectly. I wasn't a fan of their mild sauce, but that's just personal preference, when I got some sweet sauce on the leftovers, it was better than the first round. We also had a sample of hot links - excellent!  The sides were great! Seasoned green beans, cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, the best I've had! The BBQ beans were sweet and some of the best I've had. The mac n cheese had an edge on it and was hands down the best I've had! My husband said the coleslaw was good, but not the best.  We shared peach cobbler, and I found it a little heavy on the spices and the crust had almost completely degraded. Stodgy.  The cans of beverages - come on! Everyone knows BBQ needs big sips! BYOB! I found myself stealing sips from my son after mine was out.  It was perfect weather to dine al fresco, lots of bees though.  Overall it is good BBQ for the price. I think Lucille's is better, but it's also more expensive, so... But wth do I know about BBQ? I'm a CA girl.",

The brisket and pulled pork are tender and smoked perfectly.  The ribs fall of the bone and are full of juicy meat.  The meats are served dry with sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you want on it.  It's like  a \"we trust you with the sauce\" approach, which is nice.  All in all, very solid food and a fun place to eat.",

The brisket was pre sliced and kept warm and moist in some very tasty juices from the meat perhaps. The sauce was good they had two kinds mild and spicy, the mild tasted brown sugerish. The potato salad was bland the beans were spicey. Id recomend the sauasage and mac and cheese thats about all i could say wad decent. The location is odd kind of in a neighborhood and no inside seating, you order inside and carry it outside to eat there at the picnic tables or Togo.",

My favs were the brisket and ribs. They also have the BEST beans I've ever had. The worst thing i had was the chicken. It was VERY DRY, don't order the chicken. This will be my go to place for BBQ in vegas. The only down side to this place is that it only has outside seating. Which isn't bad if you're not there in the summer when it's 110 degrees. There seems to be a lot of flies hangin around, which if I were a fly I'd hang out there too. The day that we were there it was windy and there was garbage flying around everywhere.",

Got out of our Uber and the gentlemen behind the grill yells tell the Uber driver to stop but you come here (he wanted to make sure we had a ride back). We did that and he packaged up 4 large containers with chicken, rib tips, brisket, cornbread, etc for us AND a container for the Uber driver.  We got back to the hotel with a large amount of food and every bit of it was SO GOOD!! We will definitely go there when we go back to Vegas! Definitely a place to go for fabulous food!

He loves Barbeque so we looked around entirely online for something good and affordable. We found that this place has great catering prices. We got pulled pork, pulled chicken and hot links, all for under 100 bucks (we made our own sides but they have those too). We called the order in a few days ahead of time and had no issues picking it up. You could tell it was a popular place from the crowd.  EVERYONE LOVED IT! We were continually getting told that it was amazing and people asking where it was from. There was a little bit left over and people were arguing over who got to take it home. I personally liked it as well. The pork was tender and had great flavor.  I wish we'd actually had the time to go there and sit down for a meal, next time for sure!",

    "text": "There are many definitions of what American bbq should smell like, look like and taste like....after seeing YouTube reviews of Road Kill Grill.... I've wanted to try it for the last two years but something would get in the way of our dining plans...Las Vegas (off the Strip) has so many good moderately priced dining options....that choosing where to dine is a contest of what food experience do you want to try next?  .........And so at 1:30 pm on a warm Spring, Monday afternoon I found myself at The Road Kill Grill.......Wowee---plenty of parking---all outdoor picnic table setting with covered roofs.....  .....totally new BBQ experience for me.....you line up outside the front door entrance where they take your order and give you a yellow order slip that eventually you'll give to a food handler....(they do it this way because there's only room for probably ten people in the buffet serving line)......But...now here's the deal....when they let you into the facility---- you're hit by a blast of cold air!!!! WHY??    Only about 20% of the indoor facility is devoted to the BBQ buffet line----to your right of the customer food line is a delineated area for cutting raw meat---the day I was there---the owner of the place ( identified him from a YouTube video) was fabricating a sub primal whole raw beef brisket....behind the cutter the area was devoted to cold storage and probably dry goods storage and other work rooms----Consequently, because the hot food/cold food buffet line is part of a meat cutting zone--the whole room is kept somewhere between 40 deg to 50 deg Fahrenheit to preserve raw meat being processed for storage or cooking on the outdoor grill pits....  And that's what degraded my bbq experience; although the hot bbq foods are kept in buffet food warmers .....when I sat down outside at my picnic table the meat combinations were cold---and that's NOT tasty to me for food intended to be served hot I'm thinking that all that cold air and dry humidity in the buffet/meat cutting room----sucked the warmth and moisture from the pork ribs and brisket.....  ....The pork ribs tasted bland with none of the aroma of fresh hot bbq.....And the brisket was processed into uniform \"thin\" slices of lean meat---no sign of any juicy smoked and a bit of fatty brisket....fortunately they gave me enough bbq sauce to make the stuff palatable----we eventually took home 70% of what we ordered.....the sausage was scooped out of a deep buffet line food tray; already sliced and coated with a glutinous red sauce----I ate 3 slices and threw away the rest---absolutely cold with a taste of the unknown  .......the chili  was a mix of beans, mystery meat, and seasoned with lots of ketchup and crushed tomato-- The potato salad was standard commissary style that you can buy in 5 pound tubs from a Costco or whatever..  ...I've been to bbq places where three sides, cornbread and bbq sauce can be an awesome  meal.....sadly I had high hopes that this would be a \"go to bbq place\" for me, here in Vegas. It wont be for me....but as i said earlier, bbq is different for different folks---and it's probably why The Road Kill Grill has 4 stars       ......",

Since no one wanted to come with me, I ordered a bunch of food to take back and enjoy in the comfort of my own kitchen.  I ordered some ribs, rib tips, chicken, brisket, and cornbread, along with greens, and mac and cheese.  The greens were great! I don't usually order them when I go out because some places add apple cider vinegar to them for some reason.  I did double check before I ordered and was advised they don't cook them in it.  The mac and cheese was so so.  Not the best to be honest.  I make mine from scratch, but I don't mine others.  This was just bland and clumpy.  The pasta was overcooked as well.  The ribs and rib tips weren't bad, but could have been better and more tender.  The chicken was actually good, very flavorful; but the cornbread was way too sweet.  It tasted more like a cake then actual cornbread.  The brisket was tough and dry.  My husband didn't even bother finishing it.    Their service was good, very prompt and there was a ton of people lined up and already eating.  Overall they're okay.  Good BBQ is hard to find, but if I had to decide whether or not to eat out or make everything at home, I would choose to make it all.  But sometimes you don't want to do that, so we'll keep searching for that \"It\" BBQ spot in Vegas.",

Follow the directions on your cellphone to find this place. Yes, it is in a neighborhood, not it is not sketchy and yes the food is great! I say this all from experience. We decided to roll out to North Vegas to get some BBQ that was featured on Triple D. We followed the map and were puzzled as to why we were driving through a residential neighborhood to find some BBQ. We get there and see a nice long line, it's hot outside, the food must be good is people are braving the Vegas heat to get some food.  Waited in line and could not decided what exactly we wanted. The menu is not large, but everything sounds so good. We went with a three meat plate: brisket, ribs and rib tips with sides of baked beans and mac 'n cheese, and corn bread.   The ribs were alright, I will admit I am not a huge ribs fan, but I did eat these and enjoyed them. The rib tips were nice and meaty, but a little redundant on my part for ordering ribs and miniature ribs... The brisket though... dear lord I think I fell in love. It was tender, juicy and full of flavor! They had ran out so I had to wait for about 5 minutes until more was available. They rewarded my wait with a nice heaping portion of brisket and it was worth the wait!  The beans were good as was the mac. I would get both again, but then again everything was real good!  Get the corn bread fool!",

    "text": "I have lived in Las Vegas for almost 3 years and since Day 1 I have been told to try the Road Kill Grill for BBQ. I am disappointed in myself it has taken this long and considering the fact I live less than 3 miles from there, I should be ashamed.  From the moment you pull into the parking lot, you can smell the various meats being smoked. Every good BBQ joint has the smell meet you well before you enter the facility, it is no different here. On our visit, we stopped by for a later lunch and our mouths started watering immediately.   They have everything you would expect, so many tough choices. Karen went with the brisket dinner which came with a huge helping of sliced brisket along with two sides she picked (Yams and Mac & Cheese). Karen enjoyed every aspect of her meal, including the house BBQ sauce which she said had great flavor and a gentle kick.  I can never pass up brisket, but instead of doubling up entirely on Karen's choices, I went with the two meat combo. I did choose the brisket, but also the pulled pork. My meal also came with two sides and I went with potato salad and green beans. I loved the pulled pork, some of the best I have had. The brisket was good, but I wouldn't put it in the great category. I didn't quite taste the smoke in the meat that I usually like. The sides were really good and the meal was great portion wise. Unlike Karen, I went with the spicy bbq sauce and I loved it. The sauce is very important to me and I was super happy with what they have here. Both of our meals came with a piece of cornbread.  The service was really helpful and friendly. The interior is quite unique, but small. Be prepared for a possible line depending on when you arrive, but they do a good job of getting you through. We took our food to go, but there was plenty of picnic table space outside.  We will definitely be back again as there is plenty of food to try. The next time you are in the Northwest part of Las Vegas, you should swing in for some solid bbq.",

Ribs were our fav along with the cobbler if you can believe it. Corn bread is more sweet and cake like, the cut-up hot links are in a bbq sauce. Get there early because you might find yourself in a line. You get a choice of reg. or hot bbq sauce, both of which I found a bit sweet, but still good. The eating area is outside on picnic tables, and yes there is a nice breezing that goes by and it is covered, but the wind likes to take your plastic covers and bags away with it. *Tip - the 3 meat combo was enough for 2 people and we had left overs.",

    "text": "This place is a comfort food hidden gem! Didn't feel like cooking for Memorial Day, so we were browsing Yelp for a good bbq spot... 4.5 stars? We were intrigued & started to head there! We were a little confused as we approached it. \"Wait, is it in a house?\" But in the middle of a residential area along Thom, we found what looked like a ranch.  We were surprised that it wasn't a traditional restaurant, but an outdoor \"hole-in-the-wall\" family owned country type ambiance. We fell in line, which we were in for about half an hour (don't forget it was Memorial Day though!)... You approach an area with the menus where your order is written on a ticket, then give it to the people in the food area who prep it, and wait at the the end for them to call you with your order.   Before we had even tasted the food, we were completely sold on the place. The hospitality and customer service was simply over the top and so friendly from start to finish! We were offered tri-tip samples, given free bottles of water... and they were even offering free cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and French fries for MDW -- which were delicious! Everyone at this place is not only hard working but extremely friendly!   We ordered the THREE MEAT COMBO. - BRISKET, RIBS, PULLED CHICKEN. - MAC & CHEESE, GREEN BEANS.  (also comes with a little cornbread!) Also ordered PULLED PORK SANDWICH.  The portions are generous, the prices are decent & the food has great southern flavor! We enjoyed everything & left extremely satisfied. It's a fun non-traditional place to eat since its outdoors (it was quite hot out but the seating is shaded -- might be a little TOO hot in the later summer months!) & the place stayed packed with a long line (per the girl at the register, it isn't usually that crazy)! Highly recommended... great food & great service! :)",

I was talking to a coworker about the lack of good BBQ in this city and she mentioned the Road Kill Grill. She said that she lived close by and since I lived on the opposite side of town, she would stop and get me a plate. The next day she came in with a very heavy styrofoam plate and told me that the price had recently gone up to $15. When I got home, there was chicken, ribs, links, and brisket along with mac & cheese, and beans. There was a regular sauce and a spicy one. The amazing part of it all is that ALL of it was very good.  I was shocked. It was VERY good, only cost $15 and the two of us ate off of it for three days. What an amazing meal. I have only one regret. I live so far away from it. I'll definitely have it again.",

Dry brisket slathered in beef broth to hide the dryness. Possibly the most fattening mac and cheese on the planet. I think they use mayo. Potato salad was ok. Cornbread was way too sweet. This is unthought out bbq. Mistakes absorbed as knowledge. The old kind done by non-hipsters. The result is an inferior product redolent in every assertive element with no balance or subtly or excellence. This \"home cook\" level of bbq just doesn't cut it anymore. If they had options in LV maybe they wouldn't even have been on TV. And they are so slow filling orders. Hard to get to. Notice that everybody that loves this place has a common look (no frame of reference) and live in places that aren't known for bbq.. I live in the south. Ignore the Jersey thing.

This place was highly recommended by locals when we moved to the area and we finally got a chance to check it out today. We found the spot last night, but it was closed and what a surprise!!  We thought the GPS was not working correctly since it had us in the midst a rural residential area complete with horses across the street and this appeared to be some type of ranch.  We decided to try it out for lunch and once again we were struck by the rural surroundings complete with a gravel driveway.  There is nothing fancy about this place, but it still attracts crowds (like a down-home bbq).  The lot was crowded and the \"Grub Shack\" (outside eating area with water misters..woohoo) was full! We ordered at the small inside counter / butcher shop area that was packed with customers as well as employees bustling around taking  & filling orders and our wait was still only about 15 minutes...the pulled pork (sauce had nice spicy kick to it) was the best I've had since coming to this area and the beef brisket was tender & juicy \"cooked to perfection\"; the mac & cheese had too much of something so I wouldn't order that again, but the portions and the inexpensive prices make this a spot that we recommend & will bring out of town guests to visit as well.",

Everyone working was happy, joking, and having a good time, all while still doing their jobs efficiently. Outstanding employee's and very customer friendly!!!!  Quite a few customers inside, which was a good sign this place is a favorite to many people. I bought my order with a Groupon and added an additional $30.00 to my order. Enough meat for about 3 weeks. Everything was packaged perfectly, right in front of me. I love seeing my meat coming from being cut.   It's not hard to find and you get a great choice for a variety of meats. Give it a try if you can. Prices are excellent and it's worth the few minutes waiting for them to pack the meat for you.",

    "text": "I'm a Texas girl and was having the craving for some BBQ, in all the years I've lived here (over 20) I have never had any BBQ in this city that can come close to the best BBQ which in my humble opinion is from Texas. So I jumped on yelp to see what was out there, maybe just maybe there's a hidden gem in the city of sin. So after reading some reviews we decided to check out the road kill grill. The name alone sounds interesting, and it was featured on the food network.....so I'm not gonna lie we got a little giddy. Driving up it was very cool, it's ranch style setting, you eat outside on picnic tables and they are smoking the meat out there. It gives you that vibe of family reunion or family gathering on a Sunday afternoon, I dug that. Now the first red flag was they are smokin the meat outside but there was no delicious aroma of meat smokin in the air. I wanna smell that meat smokin, it gets my mouth goin! So the husband orders what he always gets when we eat BBQ..... Brisket sandwich. I decide to try something different so I ordered a plate of chicken with green beans and Mac and cheese. So we'll start off with the brisket sandwich. The brisket didn't look like brisket. Brisket should be brown and crispy on the outside and pink towards the center. It should melt in your mouth and flake apart. The brisket looked nothing like that, it looked as though they had boiled it, not smoked it. When he opened the styrofoam container that held his sandwich I thought they messed up on his order and gave him pork, because the meat looked like pork not brisket. There were no pickles, no mustard, and no onions which are what make a brisket sandwich. The BBQ sauce they provided for dipping I will say was delicious. Now onto the chicken. That was delicious, very moist and very juicy. The flavoring was excellent, and I think should be considered their best item. The green beans were full of flavor and scarfed up immediately. The Mac and cheese was really good as well, it was baked and didn't have an overabundance of cheese. Overall if I could give this place 2 1/2 stars I would, I can't stretch to a 3 just based on the fact that the brisket was so off. I'm still on my quest to find some delicious Texas style BBQ here in the valley. I'm getting kinda tired of having to drive all the way to Phoenix to have Rudy's just so I can have some good BBQ.",

    "text": "I go to Vegas at least twice a month and didn't know this place existed. I became used to the mediocre BBQ here and there and thought this would be the same. Consider my foot in my mouth. The location is at the end of a residential street on a mini ranch. When i pulled in, i knew it was going to be something special.   The overall wait was 15 minutes from line to table. I picked the brisket dinner with mac and cheese and candied yams. Huge portions for 14 bucks. You also have the choice of mild or hot bbq sauce on the side.  The brisket was so tender and juicy my mouth was in disbelief. The sauce was rich and thick which complimented the meat well. Mac and Cheese was creamy and delicious and those candied yams should come in a bucket on the side.   The best part? IT REHEATS WELL. The left overs were better than the first day. Meat still juicy the next day. My mother and I made a deal to drive to Vegas once a month just for the BBQ. Yes it's that good.",

There is one of tiredness as it took me 45 minutes to drive here, one of longing as I wait forever to get my food, one of salivation as I finally see the food being served up, one of ecstasy as I'm eating it, and one of disappointment as I realize I didn't order enough and am not still eating.  This place is great.  The people are friendly, the place is in a neighborhood which at first was weird but as improvements have been made, has become very welcoming.  People may come here because it was featured on TV once or twice but people keep coming back because it is that good and has become a staple.  I don't care that I have to drive for nearly an hour to get here or wait for a half an hour or more to eat, I am just thankful that this place exists and that I get to enjoy it.  Everything I have tried here is great.  You cannot go wrong even if you just closed your eyes and picked at random.",

We waited for about 15mins until our turn to pick up our orders.  Things I loved: -The collard greens was the best thing I had that day. Flavor was great and it wasn't too salty. The texture was nice as well, it wasn't over cooked and mushy. -The brisket was flavorful and moist. I enjoyed it very much.  Things I liked: -The Mac cheese was pretty good; the flavor was nice but just a personal preference that I prefer smooth mac and cheese, the one they had was not smooth. That's the reason I liked it but not loved it. -The hot links tasted fine but just way too much sauce for my liking.  Thing that just okay: The pulled pork flavor wise was fine. Nice smoky flavor but I found the meat was bit too dry.  Overall I enjoyed the meal and will come back to try other meat. I saw a lot of people ordered rib tip and there's what I'll order next time.",

    "text": "I was expecting more.   It fits the clickish 'we don't care about you (just look at our facility and the associated customer amenities), we only care about our food' which is the snobby version of an intentional hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint. Problem is, their food didn't live up to what it takes to get away with that approach.   I ordered the three meat plate; brisket, pork ribs, hot links. Sides were mac & cheese, potato salad and bread choice was cornbread.   The brisket was extremely disappointing. Dry, tough, chewy, and obviously cooked well before being served. My guess is re-heated which is a cardinal sin.   The ribs were slightly better than average. Again, a little dry and reheated. Okay flavor but just plain lacked that savory, decadent quality I look for in a rib.   The best if the meats was the hot links which, ironically, should be the understudy of BBQ meats. Nice flavor, not too hot, good texture with a crisp casing.   Now to the sides; the mac & cheese was okay. The mac was a little too bready which made the overall dish a bit mushy. Wish I had a dash of salt but, I refer back to my customer amenities comment.   The potato salad was exceptional. Nice size potato pieces (not big chunks that over power the dish), properly cooked being the right mixture of firmness but still not too much so and creamy flavor glue that held it all together.   The cornbread was the best part of it all. Excellent flavor to moisture to texture balance. That said, even it fell short being cold with butter not a readily available option (again I refer to customer amenities).  Summary: I've been to a number of places like this. Most have been better than average to exceptional. I've also been to strip mall BBQ joints that have had both a better quality product and a comfortable place to enjoy my meal.",

    "text": "I get a text Saturday from my husband that says \"John Mull's tonight\"   I agreed mostly because I love BBQ, I didn't feel like cooking, we've lived in Vegas our entire lives and never tried it, and everyone I've known to eat there said it's so amazing (I'm going to question these people ;) )  Saturday at 3:15 the line was really long but we drove 40 minutes to get there and just decided to stick it out. It literally took over an hour to get our food, we got into the car at 4:30! And to be honest there is NO reason that it should have taken so long. Inefficient way of working and I can't believe the wait time for pre-cooked sub par food.  The food....I'm going to be 100% honest. It was gross. I got the brisket and hot links with potato salad and mac and cheese, husband got pulled pork, brisket, and hot links with yams and mac and cheese. My son got the pork ribs, pulled pork, cole slaw and mac and cheese. My mom got the 1/4 chicken and pulled pork.  The brisket was boiled (no bark), mostly fat (legit barely any meat) and had no flavor. The hot links were smothered in what I can only describe as being ketchup...the potato salad was in the same container as the hot food items so it was also hot. The yams were pretty much canned Princessa. The mac and cheese was really good but that's about it.  I will never go there again. Rollin' Smoke gets my money every time.  **this review is strictly on the food, not the employees. They were all extremely nice and it's not their fault the business runs badly and the food is awful**",

Once inside we got in line to order food, since it was a weekday it wasn't too bad. Between my sister & I we we able to try their beef brisket, tri tip, pork ribs, hot links and beef rib. Beef rib was delicious, I had to wait a while cause it wasn't ready well worth the wait. The meat just fell off that bone. Other things I really liked were brisket and the links, I did use the extra BBQ sauce they gave us I would prefer the spicier one than the mild one. For the sides we tried which were baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, I liked the beans the best the others were ok. Oh and we both got to try their cornbread, man yes it's a little sweeter than the norm but delicious.  I would say the food experience for everything would definitely be between 4 to 4.5 stars for sure. The 5 stars go to the service and the friendliness of the staff, awesome people around here. We will definitely be back if and when we're in the area.",

You can go and have lunch which you can order off their regular menu and you can cater for a party by ordering half or full pans.   We tried to order a bit of everything Brisket Pulled chicken and pork BBQ Chicken Potato Salad Mac & Cheese Greens Youuuu name iiiiiiiiiiiit!  The brisket and pulled pork were the favorites amongst the meats we ordered and that Mac & Cheese wouldn't have been enough if we ordered 10 of them. Not because of small portions but because people devoured it.  They butcher and cook everything on site so it's a cool place to grab some lunch away from all the rest of the Vegas madness.  Staff is very welcoming and friendly and make sure we got everything we needed. I will definitely be back!",

For many years I have enjoyed restaurants on the strips and things just gotten too boring. We picked this place after looking through yelp for a recommendation and we were not disappointed! We came mid day in 110F but that didn't stop us from enjoying our food with sweat streaming down our face and neck. I could say this was one of best homemade style bbq place I've eaten.   My favorite was hot links, beef ribs, mac n cheese and collard greens.   This place serves your food in a cafeteria style with outdoor communal seatings. So, if you're here during winter time, check the weather and dress accordingly.",

Everyone went back for seconds and wanted to know where we got the food. Best kept secret in town! We served 125 people (many had 2 or 3 plates of food!) for just under $1,000 which is a steal! We have leftovers too! If you have an event coming up, do yourself a favor and get the food from John Mulls, they'll deliver your catering order for $25. We are customers for life! My husband has them process his meat after hunting and has always been happy with it. Oh, they sell eggs too!!!",

The door and the line just don't gel, it makes for a very confusing and annoying visit sometimes. I'm sure there is nothing that can be done about it but it is what it is. I've recently been turned into the butcher side of things. Good lord the steaks here are high quality and extremely well priced for what you get. You pay half here what you would at a restaurant for the same steak. All you have to do is cook it! Thanks John Mull's.",

The location: Ranch-like space within residential area.  We ordered in a small cramped room and seating was outdoors. Luckily it wasn't too hot outside.  However, the tables outside were clean and the bathroom was also very clean!  Staff: Friendly, helpful, and keeping busy. Excellent!  Food: We were pretty disappointed everything was in warmers.. it was 2:30pm, we weren't sure if it'd be different had we come in the morning?  Flavor of the rib tips, brisket, and pull pork was excellent!! However, being in the warmer made it dry and doesn't visually look fresh.  Collard greens also had great flavor. Chili was too watery, my Coca Cola was not cold (that made me really sad lol) but I normally don't like BBQ sauce and I really enjoyed their spicy tangy jam like consistency sauce!  Likeliness to return: We live in Spring Valley, the experience isn't enough to make a trip, but if we're in the area.. maybe? If nothing else around the area interests me. Cuz for $16.99 we got a decent amount of food  Likeliness to recommend: I would recommend, if someone's in that area, if they're less picky with experiences and just want some decent food to fill their stomach. But not if they're super hungry, though we got lucky, I saw other reviews mention the long lines.",

I caught Guy Fieri's Drive Ins, Diners and Dives and I took my family to test the offerings. My order was a rib combo with tri-tip, baked beans and mac & cheese. To get this combo, you have to be here Tuesdays or Thursdays. It's not served any other days. The baked beans they were to die for! Great taste and right amount of sweetness and BBQ you'd want in the baked beans with a bit of meat lurking in there. These ribs are the best in town: great chew, meaty, fall off the bone-type stuff and not slathered with too much sauce. Most of the flavor comes from the prep where they vacuum seal it into the meat in prep for hours. Genius! The mac and cheese is equally a crowd pleaser. I could have that for days. The price is right and we will be back to test the fabled brisket and peach cobbler. I can't wait!  Speaking of waiting, we waited a while. So get here before opening if you don't like lines. I say 10:30 am is about right these days. But if you're in a line, no worries! I don't know if this is normal but it seemed normal so I'll report it. I already walked away with my order when I saw this. The line was a good 200 feet long or more. people were going to have to wait because when you get to the pick up area people hem and haw a bit. I know some of these people are standing in line for about a good  1/2 hour already and it's about 12:30 pm. So one of the cooks comes out from the cooking and has one of those trays/containers you see that they put in the food warming cart to keep things hot and ready to eat. And he goes to everyone who hasn't seen the cashier yet and gives each one a rib to tide them over until they can get their order in. How cool is that?!?  What's my bottom line? Give them your money and eat their food. This is championship quality BBQ at great prices. My actual rating is a 4.7 stars...",

This is pretty common for us at bbq places and we both left relatively satisfied. We got the tritip, brisket, and ribs. I think the ribs were a hair dry but i attribute that to being the end of the day (30 mins before close). The rest of the meat was great though i am a fan of thicker cuts of meat.   For the sides we got the mac and cheese and the baked beans. The mac and cheese was amazing!! Perfect richness and flavor. Typically i am not a fan of baked beans, but these were a hybrid between baked beans and  chili and i loved them. The one weird note would be the corn bread... It wasn't bad but was definitely too sweet. Tasted more like cake than corn bread. My other note would be the hot bbq sauce, it just wasnt hot at all. It was still good just not perfect.   Overall pretty great bbq. Not the best but far from the worst. I would go again if i were in town. Price was solid for the amount of food and the taste was pretty solid.",

Their Mac N Cheese is ahmazing! I think I had it best when we ordered a whole tray at work and it was the best I've ever had. I usually order the chicken and double order of Mac N' Cheese and my sweetie gets the pulled chicken and hot links. The ribs are pretty good, just not my favorite and pulled pork and hot links are good as well. I also like their coleslaw and yams. Oh, be prepared to wait in line for a WHILE. There is usually a looooong line but the establishment takes care of it's costumers and you'll be offered cold beverages while waiting.",

    "text": "This is possibly the most unsuspecting restaurant in Vegas.  It is smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood and looks more like a ranch versus a place where you can buy meat and great BBQ. When I got there the line was ridiculously long BUT they did have free beer to help the time go by (KUDOS!). John Mull's has the BEST BBQ in Las Vegas! I moved to Las Vegas from Tennessee a few years ago so I am well aware of what real deal BBQ should taste like.  This place definitely reminded me of Memphis BBQ and was, dare I say, even better than what you can get in downtown Memphis.  Everything down to the sauce was delicious. My only gripe would be to serve some type of Texas toast or cornbread versus a big roll of sandwich bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the cole slaw either but everyone else in my family loved it.  Try the pulled chicken and potato salad. They will change your life!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of barbecue and was referred to this place by a coworker for the next time I was in Vegas.  My wife and I stopped by and were not disappointed.  Fantastic smoked meats, sides loaded with flavor, and loaded portions.  My wife and I split a 3 meat plate (comes with two sides) and were stuffed before we could finish everything.  You can get different combinations (1 meat and some sides) for 8-12 bucks, two meat plates are 12-14 I believe, and our three meat plate was 16.  If you're getting individual entrees, expect to pay 20-30 dollars.  My wife and I got by on 16 and were stuffed.  They have drinks and waters for $1 as well.  Depending on when you go, there may be one or two lines.  We had a line outside and a line inside the Saturday we stopped by.  Both lines get you the same grub, so be sure to pick whatever's shorter.  They have brisket, pulled pork, ribs, chicken, and hot links.  If you like some heat, the hot links are to die for.  Get them cut up and covered in sauce.  They have amazing sides as well.  We got the mac and cheese and the baked beans.  Mac and cheese was phenomenal.  Baked beans were good, but impossible to top the mac and cheese.  I've heard the desserts are pretty good too, but we were too full to try them out.  If you're in Vegas, check this place out.  A little drive from the strip (about half an hour with traffic) but it is more than worth it.",

I'll admit the food is worth the wait, but still they should expand or at least have a larger waiting area. My parents and I went for takeout during lunch time. We all ordered the 2 meat combo with 2 sides. The rib tips were delicious, perfect salty, smokey tenderness. The beef brisket was very tender as well. The portions are huge! For sides I tried the green beans and the maccaroni and cheese. The green beans were seasoned with smoked pork and surprisingly not overcooked. The maccaroni and cheese tasted like something I would have eaten at a \"pig pickin\" back home. It was wonderful, cheesy, creamy goodness. For the 3 of us for lunch, the bill came to $48, however we had enough leftovers for a second meal. If you've got a hankerin for some quality smoked meat, check this place out!",

Finally, the pulled chicken was good too, I just wished it had more barbecue sauce but luckily they let you take barbecue in little containers, so I was able to douse my chicken.

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is I don't really care for stems in my greens. Fortunately, there was not a lot of them in my portion. Note: the greens does have a little spicy  hint, but it is not overwhelming. We recommend John Mull's, you won't be disappointed.",

I have been very reluctant and hesitant about trying barbecue out here in Las Vegas because it's so near and dear to me, and it breaks my heart when people do it wrong. Suffice it to say, all of my concerns have been put to rest and I am a fan for life!   I ordered brisket, hot links, and pulled pork (they were out of burnt ends which did disappoint me, but I was in the back of a very long line later in the afternoon) with a side of mac and cheese, collard greens, and some peach cobbler for dessert. Brisket had great flavor, hot links were perfectly spicy (I'd call em about a 6 or 7 for white people lol), pulled pork had great texture, collard greens were a smidge bland (maybe I'd add some hot sauce), and the mac and cheese had a great sauce and melted cheese on top; they were delicious!   The peach cobbler was amazing too; the only thing that was missing was a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I immediately felt like I was back in the South, especially with the warm and friendly staff. I could hardly have enjoyed the food or my visit anymore; I will be returning and bringing as many people as I can with me!",

It literally looks like your driving thru a subdivision and then there is it. They have very friendly staff working there and helpful on customers who have never been there, they recommend they think you might like. They also have a meat shop and a place where people go to bring their meat to be prepared for them. I was disappointed when I got my meal it was very generous quantities and really good, they give you more than I think you will eat, probably so you can take the goodness home with you. I will definitely be back here again and will bring others as well. Their brisket, potatoe salad, and Mac n cheese was very good that is the mean I got also the cornbread it sweet also.

    "text": "I was super excited to try this spot, I saw so many awesome reviews, yet wasn't overly impressed. My bf ordered the two meat combo with ribs and hot links, his sides were Mac and cheese,and yams. I honestly think this meal  was just ok, the Mac and cheese was great texture wise, but lacked so much flavor! Bland to say the least, the hot links were good no issues with that , yams were basic nothing to go back for more. As far the ribs, they were very little, and we did wish they were cooked more, we  love a nice charred taste on the outside. Next we had the pulled pork sandwich, pork was great but def needed cole slaw, which it doesn't come with, but they were all out to order a side of it. The portion size was huge which was a plus, for my sides I got the Mac and green beans, as i said Mac was bland and the string beans were WAY TOO SALTY! Coming from someone loves flavor!  The beans should of lended some salt to the Mac! LOL!   **I will add that the prices are very reasonable, and I would probably give it another try, just not worth that long line they have every weekend!**",

    "text": "Well, I have waited for a long time to get to this place. I have been to Vegas more than a few times, and never made it out to visit John Mull and take in the nostalgia of the Road Kill Cafe. John Mull's Road Kill Grill in Las Vegas, NV, yes the one visited by guy fieri from the food network, and voted the state's BBQ joint, was the destination for the day. We had every intention of going on Monday for lunch, alas being Las Vegas, we didn't make it there until Wednesday when were ready to head home. We arrived just at 10am, from the yelp page it showed open at that time so we were eager to return home and went early. We were first in line because the HOT food side didn't open till 11am. But we were first in line. John Mull was there tending to business as he was most every day, and greeted our party with a welcome handshake and warm greeting. Just that one minute he spent to shake hands and say hello, and ask us where we were from and thanked us for visiting, made us feel welcome. As this was the first time here for us, it was highly anticipated by the all in the group. It was something we had talked about at work for the previous month, each day closer heightened our desire to make this a definite stopping point on this trip to Las Vegas. For those who live there it is a gem to have such a well-established and high quality BBQ joint in their hometown. We arrived early enough to walk around and look at the memorabilia and take all the pictures we wanted. We figured to get inside and start the line at about 1045am and by the time we walked out the door with our food just after 11am there was more than 40 people in line. I was excited to finally make it to this BBQ joint. My friends and I all got something a little different as to try a larger cross section of the menu. I think we all got 3 meat plates which came with a roll and 2 side for $16.75ish, drink extra, sides of any of the menu items were available al carte. Burnt ends were the only thing that was not an option in the combo. Hot Links are really good, nice spice mixture, just a little heat not too much and not overpowering. I also chose pulled pork, and brisket. I must have had at least 2 plus pounds of meat; easily a dozen thin slices of brisket and enough pulled pork to fill a foot long hoagie roll; my choice of sides was coleslaw and potato salad. I was going to make my own pulled pork sandwich with the roll that came with the plate. Another of us got collard greens, one got beans, and mac n cheese was a big favorite. The collards, if you are fan of them, were super tender in texture, salty pork flavor from the hock, smokey and all kinds of good. Making the sandwich was a perfect idea and it was a great combination. BBQ pork and coleslaw sandwich was near perfection. Here it is 4 days later having eaten off this combo plate for 4 days and just finished the plate today. Sauces are good and made right there. Seating is on site under tents and bench style seating provides group atmosphere allows for chatty neighbors to delight with each other on the choices made for lunch; we thought about going for dinner but seeing how fast things lined up at lunch I would be surprised if there is anything left at the end of the day. I didn't take any pics, as the previous ones show all. All you need to know is this is HIGH LEVEL competition BBQ. Well worth a visit and the cost is great for the amount you get. 5 star quality, without question. I have read the reviews of others who have visited this place...let me say this; yes it is in the middle of a housing development. The houses were built around the business and has been at the same location for a long, long, long time, so fault Triple D for that? Whateves. The person that prepared our meal didn't ask if we wanted lean or fatty brisket, I got what they gave us. The seating is bench style covered patio style seating and there will be a line, how long the wait is can vary by the day. I would have like to have seen more types of sauces to go with the BBQ, but it still was good. I cant speak to someone else's experience, but my was 5 star all day.",

    "text": "It was my first time there yesterday. The line was short and we beat the rush. I ordered the beef rib. The sign says it takes about 20 min to get a rib. I paid for my colleague's meal with mine. The gentleman told me to wait outside to the left after I exit the door and they will call out my rib when it's ready. I waited for 20 min and nothing. I asked an employee and they said it'll be a few minutes. After 30 minutes I had to say something again. The gentleman working the register apologized and addressed the situation. I think communication needs to be more clear on orders.  The food:  Spicy link. It was cooked just right. Smothered in sauce and the snap was great when you bite into it. The tri-tip was amazing! Just the right amount of fat and meat in each bite. I would recommend this. Beef Rib. This was a tough one. I was looking forward to it. I love beef ribs and I have a few favorite spots in the Las Vegas/Boulder City Area. I would put this as a firm 3rd place in Las Vegas for Beef Ribs. The smoke ring was so thick it made the meat dry. The bark was very peppery and not well-balanced with the other seasonings. I think it was just too overdone to enjoy a good piece of meat. Maybe lessen the smoke time and concentrate on the moisture?  Sides:  MAC was ok. Not too dry, not too wet, the perfect paste-like texture in your mouth and full of cheesy flavor.  The beans were Bush's baked beans with their own twist on it. It was full of flavor, sweet and savory.  Greenbeans were good. Very simple.  The cornbread was gritty and semi-sweet. I enjoyed it.  Sauce: It's like a Kansas style sauce. In my opinion, I don't think it compliments the food well enough. I would suggest to try out other sauces to compliment the meats.",

So I'm changing my review to three stars pending my next visit. Was very cordial, and quick to respond to my messages and is making every effort to keep us as customers that goes a long way.   Service sucked so bad I waited 4th in line for 40minutes I couldn't tell you how the bbq tastes because I wasn't going to stand around waiting another 40minutes waiting for them to take an order",

This place is nestled in the NW amongst a housing community (forreal) a real landmark it is. The brisket the links the potatoe salad the cobbler omg the food is amazing the portions are hearty, straight up bbq!

No frills... this place appears out of nowhere on a not so busy street, you park in a gravel parking lot, you lineup cafeteria style in a small space, and eat outdoors in the Las Vegas heat with huge fans blowing. With that said, the food and the overall experience was awesome!   You can tell the guys taking your order and working behind the counter work quick and want to keep the line moving.. but they're also very friendly and joke around with the customers.   Their combos come in huge servings, and there's almost no way around it. LoL. Their meat is all very tender and flavorful. The cornbread is moist, and all the sides compliment the meat so well. Very traditional.",

Had the burnt tips as a sample and they are amazing.  The beans were good, wished they but some of the burnt tips in those instead of the ground beef but they are good. Had the cole slaw and it's good but missing something, can't quite put my finger on it it was good just not great. The Mac & cheese is the bomb.  Had the cherry cobbler Enjoyed that.  Was too full to eat the corn bread. So maybe next time.   Food is all around excellent, will go back for sure. Go early they get very busy.

    "text": "No, thank you. Firstly, a big BOOO to Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives for even promoting this joint in the first place.  The restaurant is in the middle of some subdivision/neighborhood, and definitely out of the way. But you know, for some good grub, we said - WHY NOT? Well, the answer should've been NOT.  BBQ Brisket and Pulled Pork = NASTY. Brisket were dry and tasteless. Pulled pork tasted like boiled pork then boiled further in bbq sauce. The sauce itself was not even that good - I mean, may as well had bought the low-end brand BBQ sauce from the grocery store. Sheez.  Side items that I tried were beans, mac and cheese, and macaroni pasta. All were delicious, but not enough to get past one star. I mean, we came for the BBQ.  Seating outside only - which is a much preferred area since the smell inside coming from the kitchen straight up smell like refrigerated animal blood and bleach. I had to step out and let my dude stay in to make may order, to which it took us over an hour to get our food that was so not worth it. We shouldve known to walk dafuq away when that stench hit my nose, but you know, we were willing to push forth with the promise of some banging bbq.  Now, keep in mind youre in the middle of the desert so the outside is hot and dry, and there are no fans whatsoever - so be prepared if you still decide to go.  Anyways, when my dude came back with the food, he kept laughing at the fact that the cashier in the front was high AF, and she was the main reason why the line moved so slow and why it took forever to get the food. She kept forgetting things, asking for the same things over and over, and moved like molasses. Now, they did gave us free cold water bottles while waiting in line, so kudos to that.  All in all, we ended up eating all of the side items and a quarter of the BBQ  that we ordered. The rest went straight to trash right along with our expectations.  Ye have been warned.",

First of all I want to say how awesome their customer service is. From the person taking our orders, to the cashier, to the guys BBQing & the owner, John!!! I wanted to take a picture of the BBQ area & was greeting with the warmest smile & kindness by John & was offered a tour of the whole place. We saw everything from the butchers area, freezer to the prepping area.   We got the brisket dinner with collard greens & yams & the 3 meats (brisket, hot link (the best thing we ate) & pork) dinner with Mac & cheese & macaroni salad.   John brought over \"burnt ends\" for us to try. I will not get anything but that next time!!!!!! It's the part of the brisket that is seasoned, so it's so flavorful. The portions were large. I didn't even eat half of my meal. I regret not trying their ribs. We will definitely get that next time too. I will try other sides since I wasn't a fan of the ones we got. Next time I will try the coleslaw & baked beans.",

    "text": "Before anything I suggest calling your order in ahead, there is no table service and you sit at communal tables outside after getting your food in to go containers anyway. When you get there they make your order, so you only have to wait behind about 3 people.  When we got in line outside there were 4 people in front of us. We waited a while outside, felt like 20 min and when I peeked inside there were about 8 other people in front of us so we waited in line close to 45min to an hour. After understanding their system it seems unnecessary to have to wait that long for food that's already made.  Just 2 guys inside filling orders and taking payment so one guy is putting food in containers and the other guy is putting the containers in bags and adding drinks, sauces,  plus whatever you else you add while staring at the food. The food is in food trays in a warmer but it's pretty small so the guy filling food orders is working with a short top and has to reach under and in to get to the foods, you'll see what I mean or look at other photos of the inside.  Food was really good and I'll be back but I'll call ahead. After reading others reviews and seeing the brisket I changed my order to cut links, brisket didn't look to great but I didn't try it. The locals seemed to be getting the chicken, ribs, and tips so that's sign too. Everything had a great flavor and we only added sauce to try it, both the reg and hot we're very good.  Potato salad was creamy and good and so was the cole slaw, both not as sweet as southern recipes. Baked beans were on point, green beans were tasty but nothing special. I heard a lot of people ordering the collards so I'll try that next time.  3 stars because of the wait, couldn't imagine if this place was slammed. The staff is very nice and there was a steady line of people coming in just to order meat to cook at home.",

    "text": "One of the things I miss most about the South is the great food, and the variety of BBQ.  I even miss seeing the live cattle auctions there, which are entertainment, in and of themselves.  I was raised heavily on a red meat diet, so whenever an opportunity presents itself to try out a well known BBQ joint, I'm there.  I arrived with high hopes and a hungry tummy, but left very disappointed.    When you arrive, the main entry looks just like some of the entryways into the cattle ranches in the South.  There was a non-stop line the entire time we were there, and we arrived after 1pm.  It's definitely a popular spot among locals, many who shared that they were regulars here.    Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the majority of the food.  The food was served in a cafeteria buffet style, coming out of metal bins.  The BBQ pork ribs were pre-cut, and the slices of brisket was sitting in liquid, which I'm assuming was done to keep the meat moist.   The BBQ meats, none which exhibited that desirable smoke rink, were probably some of the most disappointing I've had:  BBQ Pork Ribs - Dry, dry dry.   Rib Tips - Dry, and for some reason, had a gamey taste. Hot Links - Nice Crispy Skin, Very Spicy, a tad dry Brisket - Avoid at all Cost.  No BBQ Flavor whatsoever. Burnt Ends - Excellent! They're really not burnt, but were slightly charred and very flavorful and moist.  This tasted like great BBQ! They gave plenty of samples of these.   Cornbread - Shape was flat, but moist Roll - Very Dry; Would've been better off just serving King's Hawaiian   Potato Salad - Gloppy, with an excess of mayo.  Macaroni Salad - Excellent!! I love macaroni salad, and this is one of the best I've ever had.  Ever! But who comes here just for mac salad?!?  There's absolutely no indoor seating.  Instead, there are numerous shaded communal tables outside, should you opt to enjoy your BBQ on the premises.  This was actually very pleasant, since the weather was a perfect 75 degrees.  John Mull's also processes wild game. While we were having our lunch at their outside tables, I saw two trucks of hunters, with the help of the butcher, haul their kill of deers into a separate entrance.  I won't go into any of the literal gory details surrounding this scene, except to say that it made me want to become a vegetarian!  If this is a BBQ spot, it should excel at most of their BBQ meats.  For me, it failed on this.  In fact, I ended up not even finishing my leftovers.  No return visit for me, except perhaps if I want to satiate a craving of macaroni salad.",

    "text": "I love butchers.  I especially love a butcher shop run by a family who knows their meats, and John Mull's is it.  I've been to a few others around town, but this place is spotless, the entire building is like a walk in freezer (meaning fresh meat out of the back and stays fresh while cutting and bagging) and it's a simple set up.  You have the cash counter up front where you grab a paper that has this 2 page list of all the cuts you can get, and then the old man behind the counter -- who is totally awesome and very sweet -- helps you with thickness and cooking tips.  I cannot believe how many varieties of meats they have available, and what made me even more intrigued was their smoked bacon slabs, done right in the smoke house on site.  Oh yeah, baby.  Sweet lovin' bacon slabs, cut to order.  I grabbed 1.5 lbs of their smoked bacon (without rind cause they suggested it that way), two 1\" ribeye steaks cut FRESH from the slab, and 4 pork chops cut thick enough for pan frying cut fresh off the slab.  It was fun to watch, fun to order, and a shocker at the register.  All that meat, ALL that meat was 25 bucks.  WOW.  I freaked out.  I know that the pork was at least 6 pounds and the ribeyes were 18oz each, and then the bacon...all for 25 bucks?  I was happy as can be walking out of there.  Screw the supermarkets.  I'm buying my meats from John Mull's from now on.  They have all I need when I need it.  If you're looking for a butcher up in the northwest area, head to this place.  It's worth the drive, and was a well kept secret of the neighborhood until now.    PS: They cater, so if you want great bbq just ask when you get there.  You can also call and order things in advance.",

First seen on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives I remember placing John Mulls in my memory banks for a later date. I think 2 years passed by and they ran a re-run of the episode that featured this BBQ heaven. \"Oh yeah!! I totally forgot!!\" A few days later after we saw the episode for a second time. we proceeded to satiate our BBQ needs. I was thrilled to find that this place was like a mile away from my house and it was easily accessible. We drove down the residential street, unsure if we were headed in the right direction and sure enough there was Mr. Mull's property...love shack and all.   We stepped into the butcher shop where it was very no-nonsense, \"soup-nazi (Seinfeld reference)\" type of ordering. There was chaos and an assembly line of sorts but the employees putting the food together were so nice and John Mull himself came out with MORE food and was extremely personable himself. I ordered a two-meat combo which included a huge portion of chicken (yum), a huge portion of pulled pork (more yum) and two sides. OMG the box the food came in was so heavy. I know now that the next time I go, bring someone to share it with...it isn't the cheapest but you totally get your monies worth. Just a warning...The seating is pretty primative. Once you get your food the only available seating is outside. A few picnic tables under a shack with misters. Thankfully it wasn't too hot and we were able to enjoy our meal outside. In the summer I will most definetly be taking this to go...to my house. Did I mention I live right around the corner from it? (Angels singing)  Writing this is making me crave BBQ now, uh-oh.",

We decided to smoke ribs on Sunday and when I unwrapped the two slabs of ribs I discovered two slabs trimmed of most of the meat.  Not wanting to serve these ribs to guests, I went to Smiths and purchased two additional slabs for $1.99 per pound.  I cooked all four slabs and found that not only were the John Mull slabs excessively trimmed, but the meat was extremely tough and seemed like commercial or utility grade beef rather than any consumer grade.  After ten years of periodic patronage (mainly because they are about a mile from my house) I will drive a bit further and go to Larry's.  Their staff has always been friendly and I cannot rate their new hot foods as I have not tried any.",

But wait - for me, it's all about the taste and this place kills it! Brisket, pulled pork, chicken - but no matter what - you must try the hot links in their homemade BBQ sauce.

We thought we were in the wrong area when our GPS took us into a neighborhood and then we found it...the holy grail of bbq!!! For meat we got the brisket, hot links and rib tips. For sides we got the collard greens, mac n cheese, green beans, potato salad and cornbread. The portions are ridiculous, they definitely do not skimp!! Everything had such good flavor from the bit of spice in the green beans to the sweetness of the moist cornbread. The brisket was tender and the hot links had just the right spiciness. I can't say I could tell much of a difference in the hot or mild bbq sauce, but both were good. The line was a bit long but it only tells how good the food is and it was lunchtime on a Saturday, so we didn't mind! We live in the south side of town but I can foresee many more trips here in the future. So glad that we found this place!!!!",

I will say that the sides (baked beans and mac & cheese) were fantastic.  The seating was outside on picnic tables near the parking lot......nothing to cool you off on a 105 degree day and sitting near all the cars was not appetizing. The rest of the day most of us were belching excessively and had stomach and bowel issues.  My advice.....skip this place.....the name speaks for itself.",

I finally had to check it out and I'm so glad I did. We originally went in on July 5th for Korean Short Ribs.  I was sad to hear that they had sold out on the Friday before due to the 4th of July holiday... Duh! Of course, they'd be out. Everyone BBQs on the 4th, right? Well, everyone except me. Anyway, he said to come back on Wednesday since that's when they would have more. I placed an order for Thursday morning.  Sure enough, when I walked in on Thursday, he had a nice brown bag with my name on it containing 5 lbs of Korean short ribs. I rushed home to marinate them and was happy to see that they had great marbling.  Not too much fat. A little thinner than I like but I just know to ask for thicker slices next time.  I can't wait to try their other cuts.  I've got my eye on the 5 lbs of chicken wings!",

We picked up a couple of rib eye steaks for our Valentine's Dinner this year and they were the most amazing steaks we have had in a very long time. The service was quick and helpful. I really appreciated being able to pick the thickness of our steaks as well. It's odd that it is in a residential neighborhood, I thought I was lost at first! But I really like having a real butcher here in North Las Vegas. Would definitely recommend them to a friend.",

I'm happy we didn't wait because I absolutely wrecked that plate....yelp then I turned around went right back inside and ordered some more.

Get in line on the left for an awesome lunch or turn to the right to go into the deli and order fresh meat.  We chose lunch.    John Mull's is good.  Really good.  I can't go so far as to say it's better than Rollin Smoke, but I will say they are totally different animals, offering totally different experiences.  There's just something about ordering at a food cart and eating outside that adds magic to BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and stole a rib from my boyfriend.  The ribs!  So tender.

Rolls up in a residential area and to my disbelief we arrived to farm of some sort. Parked and saw over 40 people in line! A hole in the rough!

Brisket. and Rib Tips. side of Mac N Cheese and the baked beans.   The dry rub on the ribs are bonkers. I haven't had decent dry rub on the west coast in a long while. Memphis is the KING to dry rub. The brisket was moist and the hot/bbq sauce is definitely memorable. Sides were gorgeous paired well. Best part that plate cost $19 to share for 2 people and we couldn't even finish it.

They have their dining area outside. Now when you go in for your food it's a small place, it reminds me of standing in line for school lunch. The owner is very friendly, he made a plate of bbq spareribs and handed it to the first person in line and it went down the line, everyone tried it and loved it. It was someone's birthday and he called up one of the employees and they all just starting singing happy birthday. The girl that was working the register was hilarious, she was amazing. Making us laugh and just having fun.  I had the bbq pulled pork, polish sausage with the sweet potato and Cole slaw...and omg! It was ono (delicious) my fiance had the bbq ribs, I believe roast pork, mac n cheese n sweet potatoes. We both got the corn bread, we wanted the whole bag they had. That was amazing too! We also had to get the apple cobbler, we loved it we want to go back just to buy the peach cobbler.  If you love bbq or just like me, who doesn't care for bbq, you have to, I mean have to, try this place out! It's in a neighborhood, which makes it feel homey. You're gonna enjoy it!",

    "text": "I've been craving good BBQ for weeks, and have been meaning to come here for months. You order outside, you eat outside (or take it home.) It's down home, on-a-ranch style atmosphere. There was a line, but I probably didn't wait more than 20 minutes. This is around 2:30pm, mind you. I've seen that wait times can be upwards of an hour around lunch. Don't wait until you're starving to go.  I ordered the 2 combo meal with pulled pork and brisket, green beans, and mac and cheese + cornbread. First, get the cornbread. Always get the cornbread. Hands down, best cornbread I've ever had. It tastes like a cakey Nilla wafer. It's basically a small corn cake. Delicious.  The mac and cheese used bigger noodles than your standard Kraft fare. I'm not sure about the cheese. I think it's just personal preference, but the cheese flavor doesn't really do it for me. The green beans looked like they're cooked with ham pieces, and they're smokey.  Now, the meat: the brisket is super tender and the fat melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is also super tender and has been marinaded in the one of the best barbecue sauces I've tried. It could be a bit bolder tasting, but again, personal preference. I'll be back for the chicken and the hot links (which seems the be one of the most popular items.)  It's worth the wait, regardless of time. I barely got halfway through and I was already full, but my mouth continued to water. This is definitely a new favorite.",

Their hours are not usual for a restaurant so check before you make the trek! And check the weather.... they have outdoor seating or you can just take it to go like I did.  The line was crazy and it didn't really move fast...... It was worth it...   The Hot Link is great!!!! They serve it two ways, whole or cut up with bbq sauce. I didn't know this until after I ordered so I had ordered the Hot Link Dinner (two hot links, two sides and bread) The whole Hot Links were AMAZING! The best I have ever had! I will try the cut-up ones next time. My sides were Yams and Mac and Cheese..... THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! I would go again just for that! For some reason I had a brain fog and ordered the white bread and not the corn bread. The white bread is just a plain old dinner roll. The corn bread is home made and delicious! They also have brisket on Tuesdays and Thursdays....... Will have to look into this as well.",

    "text": "In Brief: Been here multiple times. Tasty BBQ. Unique location. They've recently opened one up at the Clark County Shooting Range. Restaurant and Game Processor in one. That aspect can be a little interesting for some people, especially during hunting season. I'm all good with it, and the food has good taste. Some days are better than others. A little more pricey than average. Authentic BBQ!  In Detail: Having seen John Mulls in multiple aspects: Catering, Lunch, Dinner, Processing, etc. I have enjoyed all but would have to say some are better than others. Even some days have better results than other as far as their smoking, etc. goes. The great thing is, it is home cooked BBQ!  The atmosphere is cool in my opinion. It is not as appetizing to walk into a cold meat store to get your food but hey, it lets you know things must be fresh and the real deal. Not only can you enjoy the meats cooked, you can also purchase a variety of meats depending on the season. If you can look past the butcher shop and focus on the food you'll be happy.   The people have always been great to me. They are always looking out for the customer. The portions are definitely larger than normal. It is like your typical BBQ joint as far as what's on the menu, your choice of meats, sandwiches, sides, etc. During hunting season you might get lucky and see a deer or antelope being gutted or cured on a hook out front! Love it! We'll definitely be back.",

Yelp says that they're open at 9 but that's the shop, the road house grill is actually open at 11. The staff working there are also so sweet every time I come in. I never catch their names but 2 20 something year old women one with braces and the other one has a tattoo on her neck. Seriously, the sweetest ladies ever. It wouldn't be a vegas trip without stopping by John Mull's. You won't regret it.   P.S. ALWAYS GET THE SPICY BBQ SAUCE. ALWAYS!",

The Brisket was bland and the pork ribs had little to no flavor. The BBQ sauce made it all better! The sides were good: the potato salad, beans and a side of greens and corn bread. The corn bread was a tad sweet, but balanced a little when eaten with the greens.   Service was good and fast! I'm really happy we got to try it! Of course, this is just my opinion! You have to try it to find out! ",

    "text": "No one has reviewed this place as a butcher shop yet. Kinda surprised as it's been around for a long time.   Two weeks ago I was on a frustrated bend to find a butcher. I'm from L.A. and had 4 regular butchers to meet all my odd cooking needs. This was the closest one to my house. It's on an small neighborhood street behind a house. Definitely an off the beaten path find that you'd have to know about and can't really stumble upon.  There is no glass counter- this is very old school meat factory feel. Its not much standing space and it's real plain industrial, but ambiance with a cute glass counter doesn't always equate to the better meats that I've learned though I guess most prefer \"user friendly spots\".  You have someone manning the counter and taking your orders, simple printout listing the meats available and behind them the butcher will bring out big slabs of meat and cut it up to your order. I LOVE that it's a fresh cut for me! We ordered 1.5 inch thick ribeyes for dinner. They are choice cuts, but was nicely marbled just not quite prime- close though. At $9.99 a pound, definitely a decent price for what I was getting- supermarkets charge about that much and you don't have control on the portion sizes and thickness like here.  Cooked those ribeyes up by first pan searing, then putting in the oven. Resting them was a hard time to not cut in and chomp down. Very good quality meat, fresh taste, tender and a nice amount of fat marbling. Liked them a lot- definitely quality is easy to taste that these were not supermarket bought.  They have beef, pork, turkey, sausages, hotdogs, deli meats, smoked items (turkey leg, pork chops, etc.) and also the odd parts of the animal.   When we were there, many of the people standing for their order were familiar with the staff and even with each other. To me this is a good testament of quality that there are loyals buying by the bunches. We had a bit of a wait as there was people before us and one butcher custom cutting, but it's very fun for me to watch the quality of meats everyone was ordering and all looked pretty nice. Someone got beef tenderloin/filet mignon and that in particular was fine quality.  I think this will be the go-to place for when the particular cut matters to whats cooking and when I want the no fuss basic meats. Butcher Block and the like are cool- but I'm not going across town for some good ribeyes that are precut, if I want aged meats or something of the odd family game meats I'll go but John Mulls is where it's at to get all the basic meat needs met AND it's cut just the way I like it. Summer BBQ's will be a whole different level.  UPDATE: Went in today and ordered 2 ribeyes (9.99 lb) and 2lbs of korean style rib (3.89 lb). He mentioned something about the ribeyes are prime and he's giving us free. I thought he meant he was throwing in a little extra meat onto the ribeyes for free- what he meant was our order of ribeyes were free. YEAH FREE PRIME RIBEYE.  We cooked them up and ooooo were they good. We left with maybe nearly 2lb ribeyes, 2 lbs korean ribs for $8.90.  That is the great thing about building a relationship with your butcher I'm not talking about necessarily getting just freebies, but knowing youre always taken care of and really appreciated. I had a great relationship with my butcher in LA nad he would tell me when something was particularly good, he wanted me to sample his new sausage flavors, we would chat about foods and he would give me great suggestions on how he uses the meats. This one seems to really remember and appreciate all their customers- again customers that were in there were on a first name basis and he asked about how we like the BBQ last weekend (See BBQ review) . We are sold that this is above Larrys Meats, Butcher Block and the like. Service, quality and customer appreciation goes beyond and we're definitely going to stop by the weekends for our cooking adventures meat needs. Thanks Chuck and Nita- you guys are awesome!",

The black guy serving the food was super generous giving me some of the sausage to try even though I only asked for one piece to buy because I wanted to try it.  Love him!  The lady with him didn't seem as friendly but Ok.  My boyfriend had a brisket sandwich and macaroni salad.  The macaroni salad was pretty good but the coleslaw was weird- I usually like coleslaw but this was kinda wet or weak with little flavor.  I loved the pulled pork bbq though.  This was my first time yesterday and it was pretty decent.  I'm wondering what Food Network people had when they came here?  I wish my sandwich had more sauce or they gave me sauce on the side btw.",

Ate pulled pork, chicken, hot links and chorizo, and had mac n cheese, and the awesome green beans which were cooked with pork...so damn good!!! We bought pulled pork, hot links, chicken breast and salmon to grill..everything was tasty, and seemed fresh and clean. I asked a guy that worked there where they get the meat and he said various places, but a lot form Southern Utah. I don't know how the animals were raised (organically, hormone free) but intend to ask next time I go. They even give you two dozen free eggs with a purchase over $50 at the market. Great place!!",

    "text": "In my opinion this place was just \"ok.\" I went with my family and a friend and between us, we tried just about everything on the menu and the general consensus was the same.  I have to give credit to the fact that most of the meat was at least cooked well and was tender, but it went south from there.  The pulled pork was swimming in sauce as was the sliced hot link.  I like sauce and this BBQ should have sauce but in the quantities it came in, it took away from the quality of the meat.  The hot link had good heat and snap of the casing, but drowned out by the copious  amounts of sauce.  The brisket was tender, but because it was being kept in a steam bath of Au Jus, it became over cooked and grayed out.  The brisket and ribs also lacked a good bark that is synonymous with quality BBQ.  The ribs were tender but good have been more so if the membrane on the bone side of the ribs had been removed before cooking.  The sides that we had were the mac n cheese, beans and potato salad and these may have been the better part of the meal.  The mac n cheese was homemade and had a good flavor.  The beans could have been a meal in themselves.  They had bacon, ground beef, greens and pieces of brisket in them and they were quite good.  The potato salad was also pretty good with a lot of ingredients and flavor.  At the end of the meal we tried the peach cobbler as they were out of apple.  The peach cobbler was a let down and not because of the canned peaches used, instead it was the amount of nutmeg.  By the third bite all you could taste was the nutmeg and it ruined it for us. Overall I give this place three stars for being mediocre, it is certainly not the best BBQ in Vegas, just another \"ok\" option",

    "text": "We have lived just a few streets away from Mull's Meats for over 22 years and have given directions to many hunters with deer that needed to be processed.  Mull's Meats is a little difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area, but that's because the houses grew around the old place.  Though when you find it, you will be very surprised !  It is like finding a POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW.  Last spring our daughter was getting married in our back yard and we were expecting about 100 people or more.  My daughter wanted a BBQ style reception with all her favorite foods.  Knowing that my husband and I, nor any of our guests were going to want to do any of the BBQing, I dropped in to see Chuck and Nita and to get their suggestions.  They told us how they could bring the Road Kill grill to us and they would do the BBQing right on site and furnish everything.  It sounded like a plan, what a relief it would be to have someone just take charge of the food and serving.  We went home and measured the side of the house where the BBQ trailer would have to drive through and it was to small ! With a phone call to Nita, the problem was fixed.  We made the decission to just have all the meats BBQ'ed at Mull's the afternoon of the wedding and Mull's Meats put the trays of hot meats into large ice chests and we picked them up just before the wedding.  We kept them warm with foil warming trays.  They also cooked up the Macaroni and Cheese pans (the best I ever tasted).  The wedding went off perfectly thanks to the great meats and of course the Mac & Cheese.  Almost one year later we still get wonderful comments on how  tasty the BBQ meats were.  This is the place to go for catering and the staff is knowledgable as to how much of everything you will need.  Best of all it's real family recipes and who doesn't like that ?  I'm stopping in there this week",

    "text": "Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday- a busy time no doubt but we'd been here before and enjoy the food. We were told they were out of brisket. After waiting in line about 35 minutes we placed our order- 5 two-meat combos- all pulled chicken and tri-tip. Once we got to the counter for them to fill our order they then told us they were out of tri-tip and that it'd be a few minutes for the next batch to be done. They put our ticket aside as we waited. Tri-tip was done- but then they proceeded to fill singleton orders that came in behind ours, forgetting about our order. So now- no more tri-tip... again. Then they said brisket would be ready in a few minutes- we waited. After another LONG 45 minute wait, we were once again told that they were now out of brisket. Are you SERIOUS? I sighed and the man (\"Slick\" they call him) behind the counter could sense my frustration. He began to try to make light of the situation saying things like \"aww don't get mad Erin.\" (Your name is on your ticket order) And proceeds to turn to the others behind the counter saying, \"we done made Erin mad.\" I don't know about you- but after an HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTE WAIT- you're right. I'm mad. And chastising your PAYING customers for your mistakes isn't the way to earn my business or my money. We asked for our $87 dollar refund and got the hell out of there. We won't be back.",

I was forced to wait in line for almost an hour to get my food, and what upset me was beer was free but not the Soda's and at a $1.00 per can that is out ragous stupid especilly for the Designated Driver's. The food after waiting in line for almost one hour was lukewarm and nothing to howel about. The seating left mutch to be desired as the table was located in the gravel and in the sun this is not good for someone who has mobility issues. If the place wishes to be called a resaraunt locate it in an Air Condishiond building with comfortable seats and servers who take your order and serve it on a real plate not in a styrafoam box and plastic utensils and most important of all Disabled parking. If you want BBQ food find a Famous Dave's they have all of the accomodations that Road Kill Grill doesn't.",

I realize the hot links and ribs put chuck on the map but his pulled pork, roasted chicken and brisket are worth the trip as well.  Chuck and Nita run a great shop, they have added a grub shack outside for you to eat your food once you get through the hot line inside.  I enjoyed the sides as well it seems each side has a special ingredient thus nothing is just average.  i have watched chuck on the saw with the meats and also watched him grind his own gr beef, not to go to the supermarket for those pieces parts any more.  I plan on having Chuck supply the man cave for the football season coming up for sure",

I have ordered the bacon which they slice to order and it is some of the best bacon I have eaten, it is very meaty,IMO taste more like ham not the chemical taste like some commercial bacon. I also got porter house steak cut at 1 1/2 inches , huge steaks it was very tender even though, I over cooked mine I like my steaks med rare, belive me I'm still sick about that. I also got 2 lbs of Korean style ribs it was very tender, I have to buy again too make sure it was not a fluke, I've made kal bi for years and it was never this tender . I got  a 5 lb shoulder clod to smoke and it was tender. I'm thinking this is the cut they use for roast beef and italin beef sandwichs , not much fat but tender might b good for teriyaki beef also. I also got a turkey breast  nothing special frozen commercial and hot links have not tried yet. Prices are reasonable, about the same price as chain grocerie store,unless there's a sale then chains win , but the quality not as good as John mulls. This place is out of the way for me , but it is worth the drive :) low carb heaven",

We were driving through a neighborhood and I told my husband I thought we were lost. Boom, there it was, the best BBQ place I have ever eaten, in the middle of a residential neighborhood. I was thinking this is going to be fabulous because mediocre wouldn't survive in this location. FABULOUS, it was. We had pulled pork, rib tips, hot link and brisket. All were tender and flavorful. The BBQ sauce is the best I have ever tasted and I make some good sauce.  Our sides were Mac n cheese, green beans, Mac salad and baked beans.  All were seasoned and cooked perfectly, reminded me of southern cooking. I am a Mac n cheese \"snob\" and theirs passed with flying colors (but could use some jalapenos for a kick). The roll that came with dinner reminded my husband of the rolls his \"Grammy\" used to make. The food we ordered was enough to feed 4 people but we had excellent leftovers the next day.  The staff was very polite and efficient. I don't know who John Mull is, but sir, you have a chain of restaurants in the making.  Job well done!

Quality meat, delicious sides, and laid back atmosphere to eat. Cornbread was sweet and yummy and the two bbq sauce choices were fine. Theday we came it was hot out and the owner had out cold water bottles for all patrons for free to stay cool. Now that's great customer service.",

    "text": "Well....been there...done that.....will do again when in Las Vegas. I watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives regularly. This place was one of the stops. I have been waiting and plotting our trip since seeing it on the show.   First off - review is for the Grill portion (the meat shop was so packed couldn't get in to look around. Have to come back when its not a holiday)  Our experience began by getting out of the car and being lured to the counter by the delicious smell of BBQ. Once there we enjoyed a positive and amusing ordering process with the easy going gentleman behind the counter. He assisted us with choosing between tips and ribs with a flip of the coin. On to get the food and eating it.  The food: we ordered (2) three-meat plates to share among 4 people. we ended up with hot links, brisket, rib tips...and with mistake ended up sampling pork ribs. Green beans, Mac and cheese, cornbread were the sides with peach cobbler for desert. (we have to admit...we didn't finish in one sitting)  Brisket - on point, fantastic, melt in your mouth, perfect Hot links - not too spicy, good texture, firm (youngest, who is the pickyest eater, could not stop eating it) Rib Tips - good crust and fun finger food (my favorite) Pork Ribs - fall of the bone, melt in your mouth (wife's favorite) Green beans - yes, southern style with meat chunks, soft but not mushy Mac and Cheese - another hit with the family, even the picky eater Peach Cobbler - it was okay  Couldn't resist buying a t-shirt to take home.  Summation: You have got to go and experience. The smells, the positive and engaging staff, and the food!",

The first time I went, I had a hard time looking for the place, the reason was because I was looking for a restaurant establishment.  This place was amongst the residential houses that surrounded them.  When I finally parked my car (dirt road),I was thinking to myself what kind of place is this?  To make a long story short, you have to try everything they have, from the pulled pork to their cobbler. Sausages and cornbread.  It is absolutely delicious.  I ended up having them cater to a few of my events.  Oh, they deliver too.  Lol.  Friendly staff and great food, that's what BBQ is all about",

    "text": "I love me some bbq!! Mmm mmm....when I smell that smoke and see the beautiful site of ribs, sausage and brisket on the grill I truly get excited. This place came highly recommended on Triple D, thus we took a venture to see what all the hype was about.   Let's talk about the location. It's located in the middle of a neighborhood which kind of caught me off guard at first. You see all these houses, and then WHAM....there is this house that has a huge grilling operation going on behind it.   The people that work here are very friendly. Laughing, smiling and helping you make a good choice for what to eat. I ordered their 3 meat combo which came with brisket, pulled pork and ribs (disclaimer: they don't offer burnt tips! That's a bbq no no in my book). For my sides I had greens and yams. The cashier kind of twisted my arm to get their banana pudding for a dessert.  After we sat down to eat, I first dove into the yams which was delicious. Good texture and nice and sweet. The greens were also really yummy as well. They also give you a cornbread muffin which was good, not the best I've ever had....but good. Not really sweet like I like my cornbread.   Now the meat. I saw no smoke ring on any of the meat I ordered, so I was concerned about how this was going to taste. I first bit into the brisket which was a little disappointing. I don't think the smoke got into it at all, and the flavor was just ok. The ribs were really good. Not very much smoke, but they have a great dry rub that packs in some good flavor. The rib meat was also a little tougher than what I would like, but it was still good. The pulled pork was really the savior. Great texture and huge flavor!  Now it was time for the banana pudding. This thing was amazing! Nice and thick pudding with big time flavor. The Nilla wafers were nice and crunchy, and the bananas weren't brown. I will say this is top 2 best banana puddings I've ever had.....next to my moms of course ;-)  Overall, I liked my experience here. Good atmosphere and good food. If you've read my other reviews about Texas bbq, then you know I'm a fan of how they do it in the south. This place is not as good as good as Texas bbq. Not enough smoke, and the meat texture needed a little bit of help.   If I had to break it down, I would give this place a solid 3 star on the bbq and a 5 star for the dessert and customer service.  Can anyone outside of Texas beat them in bbq? I'm still on the hunt!  Cheers!",

The only reason I would give them a four star is because sometimes you have to sit outside in the dust and wind sucks, if it's a nice spring day 70 with no wind this is the spot. Well you can always take it to go And eat it in The comfort of your home. So Nobody sees your dirty hands in the barbecue sauce all over your face.",

I had not been there before and began to huff and puff over the LINE. I traded in the \"session\" for the \"wait\". During the \"wait\" I observed food, sandwiches, beef brisket, pork ribs, steak, chicken OH MY. The smells were irresistible. Everyone was eating while their eyes rolled up into their heads and groans of ecstasy escaped their lips. I had to try this John Mulls meats!  The service was pleasant. A young women walked the line and took orders, by the time I got to the register my items were there waiting for me. Honestly I was just going to bite into the sandwich to discover the sensation that everyone else was experiencing.  I couldn't put the sandwich down, one savory bite after the other with sizzling juices and sauce melting the bread to a mouth watering slow motion explosion of epicurean delight. No wonder gf was into a full meltdown of a \"session\".  I stop AT John Mulls now before the trip to see my gf.  I recommend this place to all MEAT EATERS! Yum!",

It tasted like they really do serve road kill verse BBQ.  First off trying to find this place is a joke. It's in a neighborhood giving the indication your going to someone's backyard BBQ. Once you get there you enter this overcrowded room to order your food. People are climbing all over each other to order, and I was hit but the door at least 6 times because of overcrowding. Now while I'm waiting I watch some lady handling food with her dirty hands, BARF!   So after witnessing health hazard 101, I finally get to order.. It's lunch time and I order a Dr Pepper with my meal. But guess what, these idiots don't have any chilled. Most business's have a cooler but JOHNS  BBQ blunder team just sticks the cans in ice, Except at lunch time.  The food is really a 5 star disappointment. The ribs were not moist or very meaty an overly spicy to boot. Someone went heavy on the pepper rub which just added to why the ribs just sucked.. If your a rib joint then act line one and serve quality ribs. However I remembered the boil & grill their ribs verse smoke them slow & low....   You may wanna rethink your BBQ trip. Don't say i didn't warn you.",

    "text": "I think John Mull's owes the Diner's drive-ins and dives show about 25% of their profits. If you are looking for the quick review on this place. SKIP IT. Not a good destination bbq joint. Hopefully I just saved you cab money from the strip. If you know what good bbq is then you will find out quickly that the only bbq that I had that is worth ordering was the ribs. Here we go.   Let's start off by saying I know great bbq and you can't find it here. Just check out the bottom of this review and you will find over 25 bbq reviews. I also know good bbq and you can barely find that here. Lets go down the order.   Brisket - Sitting in a broth pre sliced. This is criminal. They should not be allowed to serve brisket. Save it for someone who knows how to treat it. I got a sample in line and was glad I did. This was the 1st time in a long time I didn't order brisket at a bbq joint. STAY AWAY  Ribs - This was they highlight of the meal, but still nothing to brag about. If I had to go back this is the only thing I would eat again as they were good ribs. Pulled from the bone just right, but hardly any smoky flavor and the smoke ring was not very pronounced.   Pulled pork - The pulled pork was better than most. Really should have been bbq pulled pork as is had a lot of their sauce in it. It was good and maybe worth a try.   Hot Link - Not very hot and it was okay. Nothing to brag about or drag down.   Sides -  Mac and Cheese - stay away not any good looks can be deceiving here.  Baked beans - I enjoyed these but the were almost more like chili.   Dessert  Peach Cobbler - Almost the highlight of the whole meal as it was tasty. Though not the best I have had it was enough to make me forget for a moment about the wool that had just been pulled over my eyes.   THIS IS NOT GOOD BBQ - IT IS OVERHYPED DO TO Guy Fierri  Not sure how so many give this place 4 stars or more. Stating think most people have never had great bbq or maybe the standards are a bit lower than mine.",

    "text": "As someone from the south, the Las Vegas BBQ scene has always been a source of disappointment. Most BBQ places are comically bad, both in terms of the meat itself and oftentimes more so in terms of the sides. So I went to the Road Kill Grill with pretty low expectations.   My expectations were greatly exceeded- the food here is definitely passable and I think this place more than earns its \"best vegas BBQ\" reputation. Before I get to the pros let me explain quickly why I took off two stars:  1. Only outdoor seating. In Vegas. Let me tell you something about the average BBQ eater- they are fat people. When its 100 degrees outside they go into hibernation like a grizzly bear. They don't want to sit outside when eating their BBQ.  2. The service was pretty slow. There were only 3 people in front of me when I got in line and getting the food still took about 25 minutes. I don't mind a wait, especially when the food is good, but this delay was clearly due to under staffing/inexperience as all the food was ready it just needed to be dished out more efficiently. The design of their service line leaves much to be desired- a little rearranging so that more than 1 person could get involved and this problem would be instantly solved/service would speed up 10x.   The food  I got a 3 meat plate. The highlight was definitely the sausage in BBQ sauce which was very flavorful. The ribs were definitely a little on the dry side but still quite good for Vegas. The brisket sits in a vat of liquid so it was moist but a little tough/needed to be slow cooked longer. The mac and cheese was very decent but the baked beans were way to vinegary for my taste.  I will definitely be going back, although maybe in winter, and checking out the butcher products as well.",

    "text": "I had heard of this place for years and been told it was the best bbq in town but I have been disappointed since I moved west of the Mississippi in terms of bbq so I always just ignored the recommendation. Luckily John Mull's was one of the vendors at the Spartan race and I got a chance to meet the owner and try some bbq. When I was complimenting him, he gave me four free dinners to come up and try it out. I can say 1000% I will be MORE than happy to come back on a regular basis and even pay.  A friend of mine and I went last night and I also ordered two extra dinners to bring to my parents' house for lunch today. This gave me an opportunity to try the pulled pork, ribs, chicken, greens beans, coleslaw, baked beans, and yams. I can 100% attest that EVERYTHING was amazing! Even reheated the meat retained much of it's moisture and the flavors are spot on. This place goes on my list as not only the best bbq that I've had in Las Vegas but the best I've had west of the Mississippi. Chuck (owner) definitely knows what he is doing.  I loved the outside venue and since it was such a nice day, it was nice to be outside. We brought beers with us and were able to enjoy them while we waited in line and chatted with the folks around us. There are tons of picnic tables where you can sit and eat or you can take it with you.  The only thing I think some people might see as a negative is that it's in North Las Vegas but I would tell anyone that it's worth the drive. Honestly it's not really that far out. For anyone looking for amazing food from a great guy, I'd recommend this place any day",

Well you're going to have that opportunity if you're willing to drive a few miles out of town. Yes, you'll probably be in a little sun (it's outdoors), but the seating is covered, and they have misters. It's a low cost out of the way southern style BBQ with wonderful food on clam-shell styrofoam plates.  We would recommend the hot links if you want something you can't get anywhere else. They're fresh, all natural, and cooked right there on the grill in front of you. Made the old-fashioned way, these hotlinks will take you back to your childhood (depending on your age),  The brisket melted in our mouths, and was full of flavor and spiced just right. You like pulled pork? Well it's piled on thick, and ready to be eaten just the way they gave it to you, but don't do it. Pour on some of their home-made BBQ sauce to give it the depth that will keep you satisfied for a really long time. The BBQ sauces are provided in little 2 oz cups and come in original and spicy. It's spicy, but not too spicy. Take both and let your palate decide.  The sides are just like grandma used to make. They're all good, and you can't go wrong with any of them.The only exception was the collard greens. Don't get me wrong, they're VERY good, but just can't touch Mable's ( a Louisiana-born collard green magician). Eat it with a piece of home-made corn bread, and you'll know the trip out here to North Las Vegas was worth every mile on those crazy Las Vegas freeways.",

When you are waiting outside for room to become available in the building, make sure you get a order ticket or the apple cart is upset.

I found that more than annoying.  I'll go back when I don't want to grill my own dinner.  My BBQ is off the hook but iit's time I don't necessarily have.

The hot links were good.  However, the brisket was dry, and I didn't care much for the chicken. The sauce had an overpowering tangy and kind of sweet taste. Also, when I chose chicken, I didn't think I would be getting the pulled type. I wanted it on the bone. The potato salad tasted store-bought, and the macaroni and cheese was at least better than what I've had recently. My biggest complaint is that the food is pre-cooked and placed in warming bins. I've been to real barbecue places where you see them pulling the meat off the grill and then serving that to you. That's the kind of barbecue place I love. The service wasn't bad, but the low star rating is because of the food. I could never give a place that serves pre-cooked food in warming bins a high rating. So I won't be back to John Mull's and don't see the big deal about this place. Also, it's too much out of the way--kind of in the boondocks. It's mainly residential, and I passed by this regular house--not a ranch--across the street  that had 3 horses in the front yard...say what! Now that was strange.",

In addition while I was roasting in the sun waiting for my food to be plated, I couldn't help but wonder if their heating and cooling systems met health district standards.  I couldn't find a health district certificate/grade posted anywhere but I'm hoping it was at least a B. Good news, our party ate there over 8 hours ago, and no one has reported a problem.

How did I miss this gem right in my own back yard? This place is simply amazing! As you pull into this wonderland of meat it feels like you are a guest of J.R. Ewing's in South Fork or something. (Not that I have been there...but I did watch the show) You get out of your car and you're walking on gravel....classic!! The wonderful aroma of pulled pork, ribs, and brisket immediately fills your nostrils and makes a bee line to your head massaging your medulla oblongata ( Not that I'm a neurologist....but I did watch Quincy back in 1983) I know ...Quincy was an ME, but now you're getting sidetracked. Back to the road kill. I ordered the 3 meat combo with brisket, ribs, and a hot link. My sides were mac n cheese and slaw. It's unlawful to not get some peach cobbler as well. Let's start with the slaw. It was incredible. It had a creamy consistency with excellent flavor. I'm finding out a lot people don't like slaw...I feel sorry for you folks. The ribs were good, could've been just a little more tender to reach that \" fall off the bone status\" you always hear about. Mac n cheese was ridiculous. Brisket-ridiculous. Hot link-ridiculous. Cobbler -double ridiculous. BTW ..ridiculous means Great! Don't leave John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill without trying the peach cobbler.. you may be arrested... because it would be a crime. I loved the open air-in somebody's backyard feel to the place. It's very comfortable. I couldn't dream this place any better. Shout out to my cousin Big Mike for telling me how good this place was. I'm adding The Road Kill Grill to my list. I think I can hang out here.",

I asked the woman at the counter (knowing the answer, but...) if all the meat on the menu was choice.  She said, \"no... prime.\"  I was amazed!  All this was prime!  Sweet!  The customer behind me said that it was not prime.  I didn't hear him.  The attendant let me know that, \"He says it isn't prime.\"   I decided to get a boneless ribeye steak and some top sirloin to decide if paying twice the price for my standing rib roast was worth it.  Smith's was exactly half the price, as were Albertson's and Von's.  They cut me an amazing ribeye and two really nice pieces of top sirloin.  We grilled them up, and I was sold!  That ribeye was the best steak I have had outside of a restaurant.  The sirloin was good as well.  Nothing to freak out about, but good.  They both had more flavor than the normal supermarket cuts we normally get.  I went back for my 'prime' rib.  USDA ratings be damned... that meat was good!  Ordered my roast... 6-7 pounds and 2 pounds of bacon because the man who told me that the meat was not prime, said the bacon was amazing!  I did not specify where on the primal my cut was to come from, but even at Smith's it comes from the small end... my fault, I should have been more specific.  I believed the premium price meant I would automatically get the small end.  I got it home and saw that it was the opposite end.  I believe it was larger than 6 pounds though.  I went with it.  I dry aged it for 3 days.  I used Tyler Florence's recipe for horseradish crusted rib roast, as I have in the past on supermarket roasts.  The roast was flavorful, but it was tough.  I was not impressed, but this may be how roasts at the larger end of ribeye are (tough at 130 degrees).    All 4 roasts I have prepared from Smith's and Von's have greatly outshined this roast.  The worst part... a customer came in for their order that included duck.  The counter said that they had not received the ducks yet.  They would arrive later in the day.  After the customer left, they got 4 frozen ducks and \"put them in water\" per instruction of the woman at the counter.  I believe this customer ordered fresh birds.  Why else would they not fill her order at that time?   I have no doubt that if you are a regular customer, you will get outstanding cuts of choice beef, pork and at times fresh poultry.  If you aren't a regular, watch your ass.  Supermarkets deliver consistent, as promised mediocrity at half the price.",

    "text": "If this is not the best barbecue in the Las Vegas area I would be completely shocked. We decided to hit Road Kill Grill yesterday right before heading to the drive in movie theater that's less than 2 miles away. At 5:45pm 15 minutes before closing time there was still a pretty big line that did not end until several minutes after closing time.  During the entire wait the staff of the restaurant and the awesome owner were gracious and kind to every one of the patrons. They took the time to ask and remember each of their names during the ordering process. They also inquired to where we were from and engaged in friendly banter. This is the kind of service you tend to expect living down south but in Las Vegas it was a rare treat. It was comfortable in the 90 plus Las Vegas heat because there were plenty of misters to keep us cool. Being from the deep south near Atlanta I like to think that I know barbecue. This place has the most authentic southern feel of any barbecue place I have been since leaving the south. Loving my piggy I ordered the two meat plate with pulled pork and rib tips with an order of collard greens and the homemade mac & cheese. The pulled pork was delicious with deep smoke flavor and a fantastic moist texture. After trying it dry I added some of the spicy sauce and it was palate nirvana I was NOT disappointed great flavor and spice while no single ingredient overpowered another. Next up was rib tips even though it was the end of the day the tips were still moist, tender and delicious. I then moved on to the collard greens without which were not only cooked to perfection they were also seasoned well with none of the normal bitterness you would find. Finally I moved on to the Mac & Cheese which was beyond fantastic creamy smooth and delicious. All in all I will be visiting this place over and over and over.",

My dad meet the owner, the one that was shown on the food networks triple D, he was a real sweet guy and was enthusiastic about talking to all the customers.  what you should try is the pulled pork and chicken, the sausages  are really good. as well as the bake beans an the green beans.  give this place a go. i would suggest have a  GPS system because it would be difficult going on your own.

    "text": "Based on seeing this place featured on DDD, we opted to try this place out.  First the parking lot is gravel, but that wasn't an issue.  We then had to get in line to place your order, then you stand in line to pay the order, then you take your order and stand in line to get your food.  All of this is outside in 100 degrees!  This process is very disorganized.  Although there were maybe 10 people in front of us it took close to 45 minutes to get our food.  Brisket was pre cooked, sliced and resting in juice wrapped in foil until it is placed on the service line.  We also had the burnt ends that where stew in sauce, they were better.  Ribs were dry, and did not fall off the bone, again disappointed.  Mac Cheese was okay, but the corn bread top was good.  Soda and water were sitting in melted ice, and it was not cold.  Did I mention it was 100 degrees!  No one seemed to care.  We were very disappointed, portions were big, but found the food bland and not worth the wait.  They ran out of styrofoam cups of BBQ sauce, and the folks working there seems uninterested in being efficient or customer focused.  I would not recommend this place based on the quality of the food, the excessive wait and the service.  Sanitation of how this operation is functioning also gave us great concerns.    I am very disappointed in Guy saying this is great BBQ.",

    "text": "I don't recall if I heard of this place from Diners Drive Ins and Dives, or from Yelp itself, but I'm always hunting for a surprising adventure in dining and this served it up deliciously!  I was doubly excited when I asked the local bank teller if he'd gone there and he immediately broke \"business-like bank demeanor\" role play and broke into BBQ fanboy with the mention of their name.  Driving through the neighborhood, we were positive that our GPS was nuts, but then it suddenly appeared!  A tall telephone pole gate, like you would drive through to get into a Texas ranch beckoned us to drive through. There is tons of outside seating near the lot or on the side of the building. They were quick to turn on outside heaters if you asked.  In fact ALL of their employees from the order taker, to the server, to the cashier, to the guys loading, unloading, grilling out back were SO friendly, you felt like you were at John's house BBQing in the back yard.  We couldn't wait to dive in, but if you are more patient than me, you can order it to take home too.  When you get to the door, to the right was the meat counter and the cooked food was to the left.  Both were super crowded, but they are really efficient with getting people through then letting them out the back door.  The gal in front of me was ordering 15 meals and they got her through almost as quick as they got our 3 meals done.    My teen son ordered a brisket (or was it tri-tip sandwich). Doesn't really matter, it was layers and layers of amazing meat slices and so delicious that he wolfed it down!  He was the first one done exclaiming: THAT was amazing!  My tween daughter went straight for the ribs (despite having braces - the meat just falls off the bones!) with mac and cheese and green bean sides.  She silently worked her way through every rib and at the last one stopped midway exclaiming: I'm stuffed!  She never even tried the sides.  I went for the 2 meat combo with Rib tips and dark meat quarter chicken with the cole slaw and potato salad sides.  The rib tips were meaty and so tender that they were easy to sort through.  The chicken was so flavorful and tasty and also just fell off the bone easily!    I took it upon myself to take a few bites of every side.  Mac and cheese was really cheesy - if I got a smaller entree I'd go with mac and cheese because it's enough to make a meal.  The beans were tasty sprinkled with the glitter I call bacon. The potato salad and cole slaw are just as you would hope at a BBQ.  They're made to be a refreshing pause between meat courses both in flavor and texture, but don't distract from the main star - the meat!  Our Three-Thumb Review is 3 finger-licking thumbs up! My teen son loved the simplicity of the food served - just simply delicious!  My daughter dug their bbq sauce to dip her ribs in. It was as magical as the gum illy Wonka made for Violet with a variety of flavors that appeared the longer you chewed it! First sweet and smokey, then a tangy flavor tickled your taste buds which turned into a zing of fire... only the next bite started it over again! I loved the whole experience of the place, slightly scaring the kids with the name of the place, and seeing how many people really loved eating there as well!  TOTALLY worth it!  #ThreeThumbReviews",

We went on a weekday for lunch, so it wasn't too crowded. The line was only on the inside, but the wait was still kinda long. We got our food & took it outside to eat on the benches. I got the ribs/brisket & my friend got the ribs/chicken. We both agreed that the ribs were good, but wished that the sauce was cooked on it, instead of on the side as a dipping sauce. My brisket lacked any flavor, so I had to use a lot of sauce. My friend said Huli Huli chicken is better(if you're from Hawaii, you know what I'm talking about).

We didn't eat there but the outdoor scene is really nice and clean somewhere you can go for a large group. They have picnic tables and when it's cold they have warmers. They even have an entrance for you to bring animals you hunted in order to get them processed.  I thought that was cool although I wish I would've seen someone bring one in.",

After moving to the area from Virginia...my search for the best BBQ in Vegas has ended  After a drive through what looks like normal neighborhood..you'll find John Mull's. 1. When you get to the entrance, the meat counter is on the right and the cooked food is to the left. 2. Tri tip and ribs with collards and potato salad were delicious..but really order whatever your BBQ craving heart desires and you won't be disappointed. 3. Ask for extra sauce at the end when you pay 4. No cups for water..buy a bottle for a $1. 5. Outdoor seating only. Be ready to get your grub on 6. Do not skip out on the cobbler...i just wish they had ice cream.",

Ordered 3 item combo, and the amount of food that I received was monstrous.  I chose brisket, hot links, and pulled pork.  All three of them were fantastic! The brisket just melted upon hitting the tongue.  The hot links had a great taste with a kick of heat.  The pork was the perfect balance of smoke and sweet sauce.  And everything was just juicy, juicy, juicy!  Sides ordered were mac n cheese and potato salad.  Both were served in heaping portions and were perfect all by themselves.  Tonight was free beer night, and while I didn't imbibe I appreciated the gesture.  All in all the very best BBQ I have had in my life.  Awesome job guys!  Will be back soon for more!",

I had a pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese.  The only downside is also part of its charm. Because it's a tiny place in a residential neighborhood they have to make some concessions to normal expectations for eating on site. There is usually a line outside and they call a few people in at a time to go through the line inside. There is no inside seating, just picnic tables. They are in shady covered areas so it was really nice when I was there but I can't imagine it would be very comfortable in August in Las Vegas. As long as you know what you are getting into and plan accordingly (I'm not going to take two kids there by myself anytime soon, but with the wife to order while I keep them outside would work well) it isn't a big issue.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area and its not 110 out or get it to go if it's too warm!",

Yeah, it's a little off the beaten path, but follow Google Maps and you should be A-OK. Don't let the exterior fool you, either, 'cause this place is legit.  Walk inside and you'll be handed a menu and will most likely have to wait in a short line to give your order. Or call ahead and they'll have packaged and ready to go for you. It's basically a giant meat locker with a friendly staff behind a counter ready to chop, grind or whatever else you need them to do to your meat.   So many choices, too! We got several things, but what sticks out in my mind was the sweet sausage. Yeah, I said it: sweet sausage. Make all the jokes you want, 'cause I don't care. It was tasty.",

They have quite a selection of meats and sides, although the pricing is a little steep for a hole in the wall joint. The food is good though, especially the ribs, green beans and mac & cheese, which are my favorites here. If you come during the lunch rush, be prepared to wait in a line so be sure to arrive early if you're in a hurry! If you choose to dine in, there's an outdoor patio area next to the parking lot where you can sit down and eat. I come by here every once in a while when I'm craving BBQ. You can also order raw meat from the butcher or bring in your next fresh kill to be butchered by the pros",

It may be because the brisket is so thinly sliced, but it made me drink a lot more water than I'd like.   Its fine if you live close, but don't make a special trip. If you work down by the strip like me, Rollin Smoke is a better, closer option.",

Mac and cheese was out of this world delish!  Next time we will skip the tri tip and order more ribs.  The value was excellent and my whole family left with a smile not only because the food was delish but because the service was great also!  Owner came out to greet us and offered us free samples of the food!   Worth the drive from the strip!!",

    "text": "Long and unnecessary waits plus good (not great) BBQ equals a three star rating. Despite being far from the strip and located in a bad residential area, this place has all the right elements for a legitimate four star BBQ joint... But they screw it up with bad service.   They make you wait outside in the heat for more than an hour and finally you get inside the tiny kitchen only to find the long wait is only due to their mismanagement.   They take your order while you wait in line and for some unknown reason (over an hour later) they ask you again while ONE GUY fills your order. The other guy is only the cashier and peach cobbler scooper, as far as I can tell. The server guy is so busy with his comedy Schtick and small talk with tourists that the line wraps around the building. I suspect they think a long line makes them seem more appealing and creates a False sense of demand.   There's plenty of seating in the covered area... They just make you wait for the Schtick... \"Hey buddy, where you from... Your first time? Whatcha doing in Las Vegas... Awe buddy, you look hungry pal... Here, try a sample.\" By the time we sat to eat it was too late to have a great BBQ experience. I was visibly pissed and he did not bother to BS with me.   There's plenty of great BBQ in Las Vegas. If you want great BBQ and comedy, skip this place... Get some Great BBQ on the strip and see a real show while in Las Vegas.  Instead of serving great food with great service, they are riding their hype from the Diners Drive ins and Dives show... All hype.",

Sadly it is on the other side of town from me but I was on that side and the opportunity was there. When I got there the place was packed. I looked over the menu while I waited. The line moved really fast and when it was my turn to order I got the 3 meat combo. I got ribs, brisket and pulled pork. My sides were mac and cheese, potato salad and beans.  The meats were amazing, very tender and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like (for my taste) the ribs had a bit of a spicy kick to them. The brisket and pulled pork were fantastic. The mac and cheese was the best I've had in along time. The other sides had way to much vinegar flavor to my liking. I will definitely be back but only if I'm in the area.",

Probably not their fault so I did want to give them another try.  I was waiting in line for over an hour which I was fine with.  When I was about to order they said they were out of ribs.  While I was standing in line for the hour they could of informed us they were running low or out of ribs.  The first sign of them telling us they were running low on ribs was about an hour of me waiting in line and I was next to order.  This was very unprofessional.  So note to everyone , if you go about an hour and a half before they close your probably going to have to wait in line and not get ribs and not be informed about it. They seem like they are a well run restaurant because they are expanding, however they should be able to predict the amount of food they can provide to paying customers.",

As you drive down towards the restaurant, you'll think you made a wrong turn, but eventually you stumble into a ranch which provides a fun atmosphere for your eating experience.  A great place to get your BBQ fixins'!  While it isn't as good as TX BBQ, it is about the best you are going to find in Vegas and very enjoyable nonetheless.  The best choices IMO are definitely the ribs and the tri-tip.  The pork is a huge serving and is guaranteed to fill you up, but I found the flavor to be lacking just a little bit.  All in all it's a very neat and unique place and if i would definitely recommend it.  They also have a butcher shop right next door so be sure to check that out.",

Make sure you grab a side of their spicy bbq sauce for dipping when you pay. Plus, they let you bring your own drinks! And he said \"ANY\" type of drink. Hint hint. I will surely be exposing friends and family to roadkill grill. It's that good. Oh!!!! The baked beans!! I dont even really care for beans, the beans here were incredible. I am now a loyal customer.

Unfortunately...it is just a make-shift hole in the wall, that is part of a larger ranch style butchering operation in a residential neighborhood. The set up is rediculous too...it gets very crowded in the ordering area.  The employees were very nice, the prices were ok and the side dishes were right out of a hospital cookbook and the BBQ meats were absolutely tasteless. ZERO FLAVOR! No distinguishable seasonings, on anything! They give it to you in a styrofoam container and you eat outside in a wooden seating/standing area. They give you plenty but plenty of tasteless food is not BBQ! I am sorry if I have offended anyone but the ribs and beef brisket was void of any flavor!

The Mac and Cheese is the best I have ever tasted.... I could eat a whole meal of just that. The beans are cooked with meat and are also great. This will definitely be a regular meal for my family!",

Had the ribs, beans and potato salad. All were exceptional. My wife had the chicken and brisket combo. I feel they slice the brisket too thin (like sandwich meat). BBQ Brisket is usually sliced 1/8\"-1/4\" thick. I love BBQ. Have been to Austin, TX many times and have had their best including Franklins. I'm not comparing RKG to anywhere in Austin but my meal was darn good. Since I'm not in Austin now, this is my new BBQ go to place. Can't wait to go back. BTW, we arrived before 11:15 and the wait was about ten minutes. After 11:45 the line was at least 25 peeps deep.",

The location was a LITTLE sketchy but once you seen that line you are determined to find out what all the hype is about. And LAWD that line can be brutal if you are standing out in that hot VEGAS sun. There is this adorable older gentleman that was handing out COLD REFRESHING water to the ladies that were in line. Sorry FELLAS!  After waiting in line for a good 20 minutes, we finally made our way to where all goodies were. The guys serving the food were just plain comedy which made that wait in line not as bad as it was because of their upbeat attitude. The food was just exactly how they described it on The Food Network show. Be sure to go there with an empty stomach because you will want to try everything on their menu.",

Can't get enough those huge portions of REAL barbeque beef, sausages, and chicken! They have a newly renovated patio dining area, but the food is still the real star here. They recently started serving \"Burnt Ends\" beef ribs... and they are the most amazing meaty and juicy morsels you'll ever taste. This place rivals the great southwest Texas barbeque places I've been to. I must also mention that the macaroni salad is about the best I've had in my life. So many restaurants will use way too much mayo, which makes it \"soupy\" or the macaroni is overcooked, making it mushy, but this place makes it with just the right consistency, flavor, and texture. Just perfect and mouthwatering. The cornbread is also amazing...  and I am not usually a cornbread guy, but theirs is amazing. I could go on, but you get the picture. Just go!",

    "text": "Have wanted to try this place for ages and finally got around to having lunch, mid week and wanted to sit outside since it was a nice day weather wise.  As previously mentioned, they have a pretty good line already forming for lunch but it was the strangest set up I've ever witnessed.  You stand outside in a line, a lady comes out and takes your order and hands you a slip of paper with your order.  The door that leads into the food prep area has to be always closed because there is a meat market set up on one side and for obvious reasons, they want to keep it cool.  The lady at the meat market counter kept yelling for people to close the door and it is a very tight area to say the least.  You hand the order to one person who spoons out the requests into a Styrofoam container from bins of the various food choices.  Then he slides it down to a second man who takes your money after inputting it into the cash register.  Now, it is all very confusing if you do not know the system, not to mention the wait is way too long.  They need a bigger space and more employees.  The guy ringing up the orders is also the one who bags the food and if he remembers, places the utinsils inside the bag.  Several people that had gotten their food and left the area, returned to state they had no utinsils or barbeque sauce, which you have to ask for.  At our visit, they were out of the regular sauce, spicy was the only choice.  Now for the food.  Chicken, ribs and pulled pork were very tasty as well as a couple of the sides, macaroni and cheese and green beans.  Cole slaw was very bland.  The problem was by the time we actually got the food and went outside to eat, it was cold.  There is no excuse for this and I don't care for cold food.  If they had a better system, then perhaps the food would stay warmer since you wouldn't have the long wait from start to finish.  Just saying....",

The employees there are very nice and the butcher offered to cut the wings down to make them easier to bake. However, I'm not sure that I like the flavor or freshness of the wings! They are very, very large &, I think, not that fresh I'd love to give John Mull 5 stars, I really would, but bottom line, if the wings aren't tasty, then every thing else fails",

The food is exceptionally yummy, the prices are very fair for the quantity and quality of food, and even the atmosphere itself is a really nice departure from the ho-hum chain restaurants we're used to in Vegas.  Summertime can be a little uncomfortable since all the seating is outside, but over the past couple of years they've done a really good job of adding more shade to the seating areas.   If I would knock them for one thing it would be the wait.  Since their food is so phenomenal, this place is very very busy, especially on the weekends... and they often only have 1 or 2 people serving up the orders.  They could easily use 2 or 3 more people doing that, to keep us from having to wait so long for our food.  But I won't dock them a star for that.  They still deserve 5 stars because by far, John Mull's is the BEST bbq in Vegas.",

Decided to give it a try since I work around the area this weekend otherwise, it would be too far to drive from my house to go since I live in the Southwest area of town. Got to the place and there was a long line which we expected it.  After waiting about 20 plus mins someone came and took the order while we were waiting in line still.  Another 20 plus minutes went by before we finally got to the front. Don't know why people say it was a friendly service.  We didn't get that.  The girl that assisted us with our food was No Hello No Smile not friendly at all in my opinion.  Perhaps she's only friendly with the usual everyday customers that she knows.  She was talking to some guys behind us that she knew instead.   We ordered the 3 meat Combo with potato salad, green beans and another side of baked beans.  The sausage and brisket was ok but the Ribs was totally dried.  I mean, with line like that the food should be fresher and meat should be nice and juicy because of the constant replenishment they have to do.  Nope!  Ribs were dried like it has been there over night.  Overall, my favorites were the side dishes.  I like the green beans and baked beans better although,  not much of a bean person.  That's pretty funny!      Even though we didn't like the food quality the price was alright.     If you're around the area I guess you can give it a try.  Might get better quality of Ribs than we did.  Will not go back. 3 stars is what this place is.   Food not very impressive.  Definitely had better BBQ.",

So that's my comparison for stars.... The ribs were good but not as flavorful and fall off the bone as should be. The pulled chicken didn't have balance of flavor and the Mac and cheese was too runny. The little one didn't want anything to do with it. I tasted the cobbler but this is not good cobbler as barely had flavor, and cobbler probably is one of my fave desserts!  The line wasn't bad but we had big group so rather than everyone specializing on a meat to make really well, each group had a chef and our order took a really long time. Not good when have kids waiting! Not a big fan of tables in parking lot with dirt kicking up in my face from the wind either. Sorry just will wait to go back down south! I might try the butcher though as an alternative.... Seemed to have an extensive selection...",

Along with serving up total knockout barbecue, they also process deer carcasses that game hunters bring in.   It's another place I can thank Guy Fieri for turning us onto. We weren't interested in eating on the Strip and looked into places Guy had visited in Vegas. He (mostly) doesn't steer us wrong, and he often hits the best places locals love. John Mull's is located in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and therefore pretty tucked away. We wouldn't have stumbled across it on our own.   The food here is stellar. Best mac 'n' cheese I've ever had, and that's saying something. It's the nice big, soft noodles with just the right amount of tangy cheesiness. I absolutely love soul food mac 'n' cheese. Eat your heart out, Kraft.   I had that as a side to the pulled pork with candied yams (also quite delectable) and corn bread. Brandon D. had the brisket and hot link. All the meats were loaded with flavor and the brisket was wonderfully tender. It was a large portion of food and made for a great second meal the next day.",

I just left from here and I guess it gets pretty busy on Saturdays so be prepared to wait. I believe I waited around 45 minutes-1 hr but boy was it worth it! The prices were actually pretty cheap compared to other bbq places and they actually give you your money's worth. While waiting in line they gave us cold bottles of water and when we got our order we got an extra free peach cobbler for the wait. This food was by far the best bbq I've had in Vegas. I had the pulled pork dinner with mac & cheese and baked beans with peach cobbler for dessert. Everything was sooo fulfilling and scrumptious and the portions were BIG.  Everybody was friendly and I enjoyed the classic r&b songs they played while we were waiting. I'll definitely be back to get my fix in the future.",

I usually always order the two meat combo of brisket and rib tips, but sometimes I get gluttonous and get a three meat combo with hot links!!! I've pretty much had everything on the menu, so let me describe more in detail:  Brisket- tender, well seasoned, smokey,        juicy Rib tips- delicious! I eat the whole thing, cartilage and all! Pulled pork- flavorful and tender. Chicken- smokey and juicy Ribs- fall off the bone goodness!! Juicy and smokey. Hot links- spicy but not too crazy. Get them with out the sauce.  Potato salad- nothing too special but good nonetheless Mac n cheese- a lot of people love it, but I'm not too crazy about it. I personally don't like it with sour cream, but that's just me.  Green beans- flavorful and love that there's chunks of ham and potatoes.  Cole slaw- again, nothing special but still tastes good.  The sauces- there's mild and hot. I love them both, but I'm in love with the spicy BBQ!!! It has a nice kick to it!!  This place is usually busy with long lines, so come early. The wait isn't too bad as the food is served pretty fast. The staff is friendly and very generous with the portions. I usually like to get the 3 meat combo since it lasts for the following day. The prices are awesome too!!! It's also a butcher shop and they sell fresh eggs!!!  I'm just glad Vegas has a great BBQ joint like john mulls.",

Location is quite tricky being situated along a narrow street between housing neighborhoods as if you're going to someone's backyard barbecue.  Even for a person like me who has been here multiple times still gets lost trying to find this place.  The restaurant itself is outdoors which can be a huge downside with the blistering summer heat.  They've actually added more seating from my initial visit so there's plenty of room for everybody even with a fairly large group.  I usually go for the three meal combo which comes with two sides.  Rib tips, brisket, and sausage drenched in their BBQ sauce is the way to go!!  Meats are usually tender and perfectly seasoned.  As far as sides, their mac & cheese and baked beans are also quite tasty especially since they appear to be homemade and not your store bought kind.  Overall, John Mull's Road Kill Grill serves up one of the best barbecues in Las Vegas.  Too bad I live at the other side of the valley so I can't eat here as much as I'd like to.",

Like God came down him self and sat at the grill, baked the corn bread,  and put his foot in the Mac and cheese -yes, it's that good, and I'm a very particular eater. I call this soul food because its right in line with how they cook down south.  Best bbq etc in Vegas. I wish I lived closer. I wished they were open on Sundays. You WILL wait in a line outside, it's worth it!",

It inside isn't very appealing and rather confusing, but when I got the chance to taste the food, I was in Heaven!  The mac and cheese was the best mac and cheese I have tasted in a very long time. I also got the chicken and rib tips which were also very good.  I'm sure this will become a staple on my trips to Las Vegas and I will also tell everyone I know to stop by as well!",

    "text": "My friend who's a recent local of Las Vegas brought my friends and I here because it's \"BOMB!\" After visiting Texas this previous year, nothing else compares to the BBQ there.   I came here on a Saturday afternoon, around 4PM? There was a line but I guess it wasn't as long as my friend has seen it. We got in line and quickly decided what we wanted. They also gave us free water bottles with their restaurant name on it, so we were off to a good start. I could tell you now that that was probably the highest point of the whole experience.  The people are nice here but they often talk too much and move at a snail's pace. All of the BBQ is already prepared and cooked. When you order, you just get a receipt and wait to go to the front of the line where there are guys who just scoop your food into a box (cafeteria style). After finding out that that was the process, the line should go by quickly because all they need to do is scoop right? But that unfortunately wasn't the case. It took a lot longer than it should've.   I ordered the 3 meat combo ($18.10) of brisket, rib tips and ribs with macaroni salad and mac and cheese. It also comes with corn bread. My friend had to wait 15 minutes for someone to get macaroni salad because they ran out. They even mistakenly almost gave away her box of food to another person.   When we finally got back to my friend's house, I opened my box and they forgot my brisket....   Really?   After spending that much time on my box, you still messed up? How about spending more time on doing your job rather than talk to everyone and sing/dance? In the end, I really only got the 2 meat combo and paid for the 3 meat combo... terribly disappointed.   The food wasn't anything amazing, it fell really short of it. I didn't enjoy their barbecue sauce either (both spicy and mild). My friend let me eat some of his brisket to try it (since I didn't get any) and I was quite disappointed.. it wasn't buttery and didn't melt in my mouth as it should. My other friend got the hot links which was probably my favorite thing out of everything this place has to offer.  Overall, I would probably only come back for the hot links but I guess it's good for what Vegas has to offer in terms of BBQ. I honestly I would rather try other restaurants in Vegas than coming back here.  Tip: CHECK YOUR BOX TO MAKE SURE WHAT THEY GAVE YOU WAS CORRECT!",

    "text": "When you first arrive to John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill, it looks a little sketchy. Do not be afraid because when you eat the food you'll feel absolutely AMAZING! :-)   FOOD: We got 2 Three Meat combos w/ two sides. The meats we chose were: Pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket, pork ribs, beef tri tip and bbq sausage links. The sides we ate were: yams, collard greens, macaroni and cheese and beans. Both entrees come with either corn bread or white bread.   My oh my, where to begin. The corn bread is probably the best I've ever had! All the meats were tender and well-seasoned. My favorite meats was the brisket, which was tender, and sausage links (you can get the links cut up or whole and the sauce gives it a nice spicy kick). The ribs was easy to rip off the bone and the beef tri tips were small and tasty.   Now let's move onto the sides. I've never enjoyed collard greens or yams until I ate at John Mull's. The collard greens are flavorful and doesn't have the rough texture that normally comes with this side dish. The Yams is a bit on the sweater side, but is a nice compliment to the smokey BBQ meats. The macaroni and cheese and beans was tasty as well, but tasted like the usual sides you'd get at another BBQ joint.   We ordered the peach cobbler for dessert. The peaches were fresh, which is always a plus. However, it did not have the crumbly top that I usually like. Overall, that peach cobbler was yummy, but not my favorite part of the meal.   PRICE: All items were reasonably priced. For my entire meal for two people it came out to $41 and the leftovers lasted us two more meals since the portions were so big! I recommend if it is your first time to get the three or two meat entree so you can try a variety of items for a lower cost.   SERVICE: I was lucky to not wait in line too long. I arrived there at 2:35 PM and waited about 25 minutes to get my food and pay. However, when I left at around 3 PM there was already a line out the door! So I recommend coming here when it is not rush hour. However, if you do come when it's busy bring a book or have your phone fully charged to keep you busy while you wait! The staff was nice and sweet. You order your food inside at the counter and they serve you similar to a cafeteria style, then you eat it outside, but you can also take it home as well.   Overall, my experience at John Mull's was memorable and awesome. I can see why this place is highly recommended and may have the title of \"The Best BBQ in Las Vegas.\"   Happy Dining,   J Tran",

    "text": "I feel like something is wrong with me because I'm giving this place only 3 stars while everyone is obsessed! But, I've eaten bbq ALL my life...I have pictures dating from when I was 6 months old nubbing on some ribs so I kind of like to think I have a sense for it. Hahahha. Growing up with bbqd food, eating bbqd food elsewhere from someone else's home...our home...in other states, etc...I will say I've developed a strict taste when eating bbq food at establishments.  Husband and I shared the 3 meat combo. Pulled pork, brisket, and their links...had their mac n cheese and cornbread as our sides...I'm not a mac n cheese person but I thought it wasn't so bad. Their cornbread was definitely on point! I hate that I even had to share my bites with the husband. Should've bought extra. Hahahha. He ate the brisket and links while I just ate the pulled pork. If you're taste buds work like mine...safe to say it tasted like pulled pork with bbq sauce. Husband gave a thumbs up for his share. Although, he did share a disappointment it didn't seem to have tasted as fresh out the smoker as he imagined. We had come during the week around 12 and he felt like he was eating yesterday's leftovers.   During the week you have to go into the shop for food. Next time we come we'll probably brave the long weekend lines just to get that outdoor experience my husband wants to feel.  While John Mulls is good, it isn't anything amazing. You aren't going to get your mind blown like something out of this world. If you've starved yourself all day, you may distort your reality and think so. However, here in LV...we lack what John Mulls does. They're serving you meat straight from their shop they've butchered themselves. So with that in mind...I think they're good in that sense! I would come here for bbq food versus going to some \"Please wait to be seated\" establishment.   If you got a big family as we do...the plates are certainly shareable between kids unless you have kids that can chop meat down faster than a butcher can. However, my children arent too carnivorous so between my 9 and 7 year old...a 3 meat combo will do its job. Thank goodness because it isn't cheap eats to be buying them their own individual plate that they may or may not even like/finish.  No high chairs or anything. Love the ranch style eating with their picnic tables. Bring the kids and stroller too!  Enjoy!",

The brisket was very thin and didn't have much flavor, the ribs were okay (not great), the cornbread was too sweet (tasted like cake not cornbread) and the Mac & cheese was yummy. So only one thing was actually good. While we were eating I was thinking \"well at least the Mac & Cheese is good...it wasn't a total waste\" but then...my upset stomach began. My stomach was messed up all day and into the evening. My friend had the same reaction. I'm so disappointed.   If you do decide to go here, I wouldn't go in the summer unless you plan to take the food home because the only seating is outside on picnic tables. Luckily it wasn't too hot the day we went, but it still wasn't comfortable.",

    "text": "Everyone and I mean everyone talks about this place as the must try! I love all types of food but there's a special place in my stomach for BBQ. After living in Vegas for 18 months I finally found an opportunity to give it a try!   I went with the 2 meat combo with brisket and hot link, collard greens, yams and cornbread. And because fellow Yelpers said I had to, I also got the peach cobbler.   A few things that kept it from being 4 or 5 stars for me:  1) Portion size- I have a pretty major appetite so it's kinda hard to fill me. But I still felt like the little scoop of each side, and the amount of meat was subpar. A friend who was with me told me the serving plates they're using now are new and that they're filling these up but the old larger plates they used had them delivering bigger portions.   2) Spill Over- I only carried my platter outside to a table. It's not like I transported it home. The juices from the collard greens was all over my brisket, hotlink, and yams. I don't like my food to touch, as it is. So this was a killer for me.   Good things: cornbread was really good, sauces (I tried both hot and mild) were very good, peach cobbler (also very small portion but it was only $3 so little was expected of the size)   Don't get me wrong, very tasty. But for me it did not live up to the overwhelming hype. After having tried, I can now say that this is not my favorite BBQ place in the valley. But I still recommend you give it a shot to judge for yourself.   If you want to know the best BBQ place in the valley, message me",

We didn't try the bean's but others in our group did and said they were delicious. Together burnt ends were still moist and tender, and he hot link was one of the best I ever had.   Normally when you go to a bbq place there are hit and miss on their items, especially on their sides. But this place everything everyone got was a hit. No one was disappointed with anything. The only thing I'll say is that they use a lot of black pepper - so if you don't like that you may not enjoy it as much as others. I could taste it most in the mac & cheese and hot link. But no one we were with minded it.   Also - Veteran's meals were free for Veteran's Day. Since both my sister and brother in law were vet's this was a really nice surprise.",

    "text": "I decided to take a little adventure to North Las Vegas. Since I'm never in the area it made sense to try to hit as many of my bookmarks as possible.   John Mull's was one of these locations. Located in a more residential part of the of town, I was surprised when we arrived at the restaurant. It has a rural BBQ restaurant feel, which I really liked.   We stood in line and I decided to order the three meat combination with rib tips, ribs and pulled pork with a side mac & cheese and baked beans. I paid at the counter and they they give you a receipt to hand to the guys in the trailer. It was a little disorganized it the guys made sure to take all the customers in the proper order.   They informed me that they were out of rib tips and I opted for the hot links instead. I don't usually like sausage but this ended up being my favorite part of the meal. The ribs and pulled pork were also good but the standouts were the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was so cheese and delicious. It was some of the best I've had in town.  The service was really nice and friendly. I was especially impressed by the guys serving up the food. They ran out of cornbread and when I asked about white bread the guy went out of his way looking for some for me and was so apologetic when he couldn't locate any.   I'm not a huge BBQ fan typically but I can't wait to try this place when I find myself in North Las Vegas again.",

Not sure if it's simply overrated or just a lack of good bbq in Vegas so there is nothing else around to compare it too.   The hot link was my favorite.  And the next was the Mac n cheese. Which isn't even a meat lol.  The ribs were ok but not really smoky.  Fortunately the bbq sauce was incredibly good and saved it.   The burnt ends weren't great and basically tasted like boring roast beef.  The beans were great.  The collard greens were plain.  And the peach cobbler was just ok as well.   It wasn't bad.   I left full.  But not really as good as all the hype.",

Everything is super flavorful. The corn bread is sweet and moist. The yams are a must order. Bottles waters are FREE.  You can eat outside with a large fan and water misters. The best thing was their customer service. Seriously 10/10 for positive attitudes and helpfulness. The prices are ridiculously cheap. Don't waste your time and money on other BBQ restaurants on the strip. I will definitely be coming back!",

I really wanted to eat it there, so my food wouldn't get soggy or cold by the time I got home, however there were A LOT of bees outside, by the tables, they got inside my drink and were going towards my food :( Maybe it was bad timing.

Then, on memorial weekend, there's a 25 minute line. Totally expected. The line is shaded and there's seating there with various memorabilia along the path that gives something to look at If you don't have anyone to talk to. Thought it might be worth mentioning. The wait goes pretty fast because everyone is excited and it's a nice relaxed atmosphere.   I ordered the rib tip dinner. It came with two sides. They were out of chili. Bummer. I got the baked beans and macaroni salad. Both were excellent. So, you might be wondering about the rib tips. I will let you try for yourself. They did provide spicy and regular sauce. It was useful. The spicy could've been a tad bit spicier but was still very tasty and complimented the meat perfectly.   Would be perfect for a picnic or just chilling at a jazz concert in the park.",

It's a bit off the strip, but it's worth it. The location is a little strange, it's in the middle of a residential area. But from talking to our friend and the employees here, this area used to be a ranch with lots of land.   Lines can be long, especially on a hot summer Vegas day, but people are nice and the workers try to get you out as soon as they can.  What we ordered: 3 meat combo (16.99) pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork Beef rib dinner - can take about 20 minutes tho Sides: collard greens, chili (new!), beans, and mac n cheese Sodas and water $1 Mild or \"hot\" bbq sauce.   Yup everything was good. Sooo frigging good. It is our point to come here EVERY time we are in Vegas.  You are soooo in for a treat. Love this place.  Huge parking area.  $$",

As noted by many first timers you stand in line outside the facility / market, have your preorder taken, and wait your turn to enter the business. Plenty of people working the grills, food service lines and market. They are pretty efficient, but somewhat pushy on getting you out of there. I understand this, though, as the line continued to grow and folks getting irritated waiting is not the best business practice. Nobody was outright rude, as some have noted.   We all ordered a myriad of items. The meat products were okay overall, but I was not a big fan of some of the side dishes. Overall, I would eat here again (and maybe my rating would increase, or decrease for that matter). Although I have had moister meats elsewhere, they were A-OK in my book. But, I won't recommend the crew going here - yet would do so without complaint if the others wanted to patronize the place again.   I won't be breaking each item down for review, as I have on some reviews of the past, as my minimal comments should be sufficient regarding MY experience.",

A different and pleasing texture than other briskets.  It stands in a Bbq jus waiting to be placed lovingly on your plate. The links are great!  Perfect SNAP to them.

You don't have to go to Texas or KC for good BBQ anymore.. I order the 3 meat combo with hot links, brisket, pork ribs, that came with 2 sides green beans and chilies, also included in the combo is one of the BEST cornbread I ever had. My wife ordered the burnt end dinner with 2 side, macaroni and cheese and potato salad, my friends ordered 3 meat combo with chicken, ribs, and pulled pork with 2 side, greens and BBQ beans. EVERYTHING was cooked to PERFECTION!!! Oh let's not forget the price is RIGHT.. This will be my to go place every time I go to Vegas.. Hands down best BBQ in the West Coast!!",

BUT!  every time I called and spoke to Nita, she was rude to me.  I would be placed on hold for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.  My company spent over $6500.00 with this company.  I would think they would give me a little customer service.    We had a little hiccup the morning of.  They had told us that they would arrive by a certain time and they were a little late.  But we were calling their phone number and the phone was out of service.  I was having a panic attack but eventually they showed up and everything was wonderful.  But my coworker drove to their restaurant because we were in full panic mode, expecting over 300 guests and he says that Nita was rude to him too.    I hate that I had such a bad experience dealing with them on the phone, because they really did do a good job.  But you have a lot of good BBQ options in Vegas, I don't know if I would deal with them again considering their may be others out there who really want our business.",

    "text": "I grew up down the street & never knew this place existed, but I wish I did!  My sister & I wanted to pick-up food for the family on a Saturday afternoon. We tried to order pick-up to avoid the line, but they didn't take phone orders on Saturdays.  This location is in a neighborhood & you probably wouldn't notice it unless you're looking for it, but you'll see the \"Road Kill Grill\" sign. You park your car in the dirt. You can see there is plenty of outside seating & it seems fun to eat your food there because it adds to the experience.  We went in line, which seemed to be very long. They were giving out samples of their ribs & it was SO good that we decided to wait. We were worried that it would take more than an hour, but it went quicker than I thought. We were given menus to look at & someone wrote our order on a ticket outside while we were waiting.  They were allowing a group of people in at a time inside & I noticed people who weren't too far ahead in line leaving with their food by the time we got to the front. Once you're inside, it's basically like cafeteria set-up. They take your ticket & put your order together while you pay at the end.  We got our orders for the family & brought it home! The combos gave us the opportunity to try more & share it, plus it seemed like a better deal! I thought it was a good price for what we got & everything was delicious!  A lot of people raved about the cobbler. I'm not into cobbler, but I think I'll try it next time!",

You could go in there blind and point at the menu and it would be a winner!!!!  The servings are great value for the money. You won't feel like you got screwed and the serving size makes up for the wait time in line. You go in as the guy calls you in and once inside he directs you how and where to stand. I felt like I was at the soup nazi \"NO Q FOR YOU!!! COME BACK 1 YEAR!!!!!\"  If I could put that smell in a spray can, I'd be freakin rich!!!!  We got a3 meat combo of rib tips, brisket and pulled pork worth every penny and sooooo juicy it'll make you cry!!! We also got the burnt ends and tasty and soooo moist not dry like some burnt ends are elsewhere,,,, I forgot all my order and went back but the beast of a guy that looked like he could use The Rock for a toothpick had my stuff ready and really organized and so nice about my stupidity....the sides were baked beans, chili, Mac and cheese and yams all were perfect and will probably bring back memories of childhood or other great meals.   We even got extra side of smoked links and cornbread to die for. I don't know how the cute girl that made up our order stays so firm and hottie when most would look like they are auditioning for 600 pound life if you worked there ....Peach cobbler as all of the cobbler  are gooey and not overly sweet like the yams,,,if you were diabetic, it would be worth a couple extra hits of insulin to have any of it...if they don't have your type of smoked meats,,,,it doesn't exist or you don't need it!!!!  I'm definitely gonna try the smoked turkey this thanksgiving!!  It's out in the boonies but worth a 2 hour drive for us and death row last meal good!!!! Do not come to Vegas and miss this secret jackpot!!!!",

This place is always busy so I suggested ordering ahead even then you will wait but you won't have to wait in a line with 20 plus people. The ribs used to be outstanding but they aren't as good any more seems under cooked and not much of a smoked flavor. So I choose to get rib tips, hotlinks cut, and tri-tip. I love the collard greens, baked beans, green beans, and they sell the best Mac and cheese. I don't even eat Mac and cheese but I eat the Mac and cheese from John mulls. I always have to order at least 3 extra corn breads omg I would kill for that recipe that corn bread is so good it's like cake.",

    "text": "Very generous portions, decent prices, and most importantly great barbeque!  Yes, the lines are long. We got there a bit after 4pm on Saturday and there were probably more than 40 people in front of us. We actually got out of there within 40 mins, so actually not that bad, considering each order would take about 1-2 minutes each. Now the reason the lines are long... the guys here are friendly and talkative. A bit too much so. It keeps the lines moving slowly as opposed to fast service but no interaction. So what would you prefer? The guys offer kids free cornbread samples, gave lots of us free cold bottled water since it was hot, and even offered people towards the back of the line a whole rib each!  We ordered the three meat combo for $16.65 that comes with two sides and cornbread; brisket, rib tips and ribs were our choices, and sides of baked beans and mac and cheese. The servings are big! More than enough to share with another person. A two meat combo is $2 less so why not get the three meat. We got five slices of brisket, 3 large ribs and a heaping mound of rip tips.  The ribs were boxed separately bc it would not all fit in one. The brisket is sliced thin and kept in its juices. It's cooked well done but still so tender. The ribs and rib tips were very meaty and juicy. The rib tips even had this nice crunch on the outside but yet still tender inside. They offer two bbq sauces, and they have piles of the mild ready to go, but you have to request the spicy. And they let you take as many as you need. None of that charging extra bullshit.  As for the sides, I didn't think the mac and cheese was really all that. I'm very picky about my mac and cheese and don't like the noodles too soft. They were too soft for my liking. But there was plenty of cheese, too much even. The baked beans bf felt too sweet but I thought it was alright, but just barely. A pinch more sugar and it would have been a dessert for me. There were chunks of bacon and ground beef in there too. I loved the corn bread. I didn't find it too sweet at all, but would have liked a bit more crunch with more corn meal.  The star here really is the meats. We even got another side of mac bc everyone raved about it, and at $3 for a 6oz container, it's overpriced. I really feel they make their money back on the sides and not the meat bc bbq takes to much time and energy to make and they just don't really charge that much for how much they give you. The guy packing our order got a big pile of brisket for us, and decided to put some back. Then ended up getting more anyway and putting it in the box! The sides on the other hand, very cheap to make and high margins.  Make sure to ask them for a frequent diner card. After the 10th one, the 11th is on them. Apparently not many people know about this. The people behind us were long time customers and didn't know about it. When asked when they started doing it, he replied \"A long time ago!\"",

Let me emphasize the quality of the meat seems good, the customer service was horrible. After taking my order I stood there for more than 15 minutes with my cousin in a back brace. After asking how much longer I told them I was going to wait outside because there is no room to wait inside, let alone sit down. She assured me that she would come get me. I waited outside for another 15, 20 minutes. I began to notice people coming out who came in after me. I went back inside and she said it would be another 15 mins. Ok I admit I was everything but nice. Let's be clear, $90 worth of meat is not that big of an order to take 45 minutes. So if you are in a hurry think twice.",

Food is fresh so fresh you might have to wait for certain meats but, its definitely worth the wait   I came at a good time so I avoided \"the line\" which came shortly after I placed my order..the inside can get a little cramped but orders move out pretty fast.   I'm sure I'll be back just judging off the smell I ordered the 2 meat combo tip/brisket mnc &baked beans   I had to have a quick taste of a rib tip ...I can no  longer say Vegas doesn't have a good place for Bbq   Perfect flavor and tenderness",

    "text": "We visited John Mulls yesterday and the food is really good. The ribs are very tender and moist. This place doesn't disappoint. When you arrive, expect to be in line for about 45min to a 1hr. If it is a hot day, it will feel like it is longer.  I am not sure how it is on weekdays, but on a Saturday we were in line for about this amount of time.   The best things to order are the ribs, rib tips, brisket, and hot links. The meat is delicious and one of the Best in Vegas. If you are looking for some good home-cooked bbq, please visit this place, you will not be disappointed. It will be well worth the drive.   The location of this place is closest to Gowan and Thom which is basically near Craig Rd and Decatur, that is in the northwest area of the valley. You will know when you are there when you see a bunch of cars parked on the ranch. They have tables outside where you can eat and chill too.   However, if you order the chicken, order an additional meat or get the 2-3 meat combo because the chicken is on the small side for the amount of money you are paying. If you are trying to share a meal, or want to have leftovers, you will need to pair the chicken with another meat to do so. Moreover, if you get the brisket and rib tips combo, it will be enough for two or three days and it will also be more than enough to share with others.   The side dishes are plentiful when you get them with the combo plate. If you want additional sides, they are very small and a bit over priced. Even though this place is pricey, the food quality does average this out.   Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars because it is a good place to go for home cooked meals. Staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxed environment and family-oriented atmosphere.",

The skinny black server was wearing shorts hanging halfway down his butt. Not very appetizing while dishing out food.   2. He took my order slip and after helping out the 2 ladies in front of me he then proceeded to fill the orders of 2 ladies that were behind me in line.   3. Then he had the nerve to tell me to move because I was holding up the line.   4. As the empty pans are being changed out, they are dripping pan condensation water all over the other food.   The food is still good but their employees need to be monitored because their attire, service and food handling need upgrading.",

The cornbread is awesome!  For sides, I couldn't get enough of the mac & cheese and the baked beans.  The potato salad was also very tasty.

    "text": "Fantastic Barbecue!!!! I've waited an entire year to come back to this event and eat at this bbq stand!!! Some of the BEST BBQ anywhere!!!  I of course opted for the 3 meat & 3 side meal getting Ribs,Pulled Pork,Brisket plus baked macaroni and cheese and macaroni & potato salads. 3+3=$16 well worth it.  Bottled water & Canned Soda were only $1 too!!! The food is ordered at one end and served at another to keep it moving-other vendors have 30+ minute wait because of their disorganized service.  Immediately upon opening my order I noticed I had been given a leg & thigh of bbq chicken and NO pulled pork or Macaroni and Cheese. When I went back to explain they graciously provided me the missing items. and I ended up with an extra piece of chicken. Fair enough for the inconvenience;)  The food was really good. Perfectly cooked barbecue. The ribs falling of the bone tender and moist with a great bbq sauce on the side. The brisket -some of BEST ever!! Tender melt in your mouth sliced paper thin!! The chicken was smoked through but moist and tender plus it had a little kick to it. The Pulled pork was great but was already sauced(personally I prefer adding my own) The macaroni & potato salads were homemade and pretty good but the baked macaroni and cheese was a little overdone and mushy with no crunchy topping to indicate it being BAKED mac n chz and no real cheese flavor.  John Mulls Meats operates a butcher shop in NW Las Vegas and does event catering but this event is the ONLY time they come out during the year so get down to FREMONT and check them out before it's too late. Taste & Sounds of Soul goes on through February 21st!!!",

Every employee I came in contact with was friendly and kind. They passed out water bottles, since we were standing in he sun waiting for our food.   I ordered the rib tips with green beans, macaroni and cheese, and corn bread. All of the sides were absolutely amazing and delicious as was the spicy BBQ sauce.  I would never order the rib tips again because of the overpowering taste of liquid smoke in the meat. I could still taste it three hours later. I will definitely go again, but I will order a different kind of meat. My friend ordered the brisket. She received a huge portion of meat and said it was delicious with no strong taste of liquid smoke.",

They will automatically substitute meats if out of one kind with out your consent. Supposably I have a comp waiting. If you want good bbq I would suggest Rolling Smoke bbq. Everything is much faster and they are open late and my fav they have sweet potato.",

I called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.  Feeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever.",

The baked beans had ground beef (I think) and were my absolute favorite. They also had the best Mac n cheese I've EVER HAD in my life and the only person who makes better pasta salad is my grandma.  I loved sitting outside on the CLEAN (such a big deal for me!) tables and benches, it really made me feel like I was back home, in the middle of summer, enjoying some home cooked bbq. You can see them cooking the meat in the back, on the bbq and in their smoker I cannot wait to go back or even order some special meats to go! As we were leaving I noticed that we can call ahead for speciality meats (chorizo and lamb to name a few). You better believe I want to try both of those!!!",

We were given a sample and they were wonderful but we'd already made up our mind. This place is hard to find but a wonderful secret. As we were eating the owner came out and visited with us. A very nice, hard working man. Whenever I'm in Vegas I will go here. No better food anywhere. Oh, and with 2 bottles of water the bill was $20 for 2 of us. What a delicious deal.",

Its located in the middle of a neighborhood, which is probably why weve lived here so long and didn't know about them. I was born and grew up in Texas, so Ive had some amazing BBQ, but this beats all of them hands down! This is the best BBQ I have ever tasted. The Brisket sandwiches were so tender and amazing, it melted in your mouth like butter and so did the awesome rolls it was served on. We also tried the 3 meat platter for dinner. The Brisket, Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken were so incredible! Every single thing was just as good as the next!! We were so amazed! The Mac & Cheese and the Baked Beans are also amazing! The meaty beans were unlike any Ive ever had and the creamy Mac & cheese was to die for! We are so glad we found this place and our only regret is that we didn't find it sooner, because we would have been eating at it for years! We will definitely be eating at this place quite a bit in the future, I think we will become regulars soon! The employees are all super nice, friendly and helpful! They only have Tri-Tip on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so even though we just went there on Saturday, we will definitely be going on Tuesday this week! If you are looking for some award winning, out of this world amazing BBQ, then you have got to give this place a try!! You will not be disappointed, I promise!!! Thanks for the amazing BBQ food, we will definitely be back since you are in our neighborhood!",

But once you pull up you automatically see the long line that has formed.   We came on a Saturday afternoon, which you can guess is their busiest time of the week. We waited in line for 1 hour and 10 minutes. I honesty think the line wasn't THAT long. I thought we'd be in line for 30 minutes and not 1 hour 10 minutes. I definitely developed a big appetite by the time we got to the front of the line.   I ordered a 2 meat combo w/ collared greens & Mac n Cheese. I chose 1/4 chicken and ribs as my meats. I also ordered a peach cobbler. I picked the HOT BBQ sauce which was the perfect kick. The meats were on point with the moistness and flavors. The Mac n Cheese was to die for. Probably one of the best I've tasted. Now the peach cobbler tasted like it just came out of the oven it was so delicious.   The portions are pretty big. I barely even dented my meal. I had to save it for later. They aren't cheap with their food, for sure.   One thing that bothered me was.. They took a deer or some sort of animal out of the trunk and carried it to the door. It was dead and i think it was skinned! I gasped and turned around real quick! I mean I know I'm eating animals but I sure don't want to see how you make it, kill it, or cut it!   Staff was nice. I suggest coming on a weekday early in the morning so you don't get stuck in the line for hours. And order and eat at home if you didn't travel far because they only have outside seating and there are flies everywhere.",

On Saturdays you actually eat outside as well under a couple of covered areas with no reserved tables, it gets crowded so hopefully you can snag a table.    I'm very picky about BBQ and this place was as good as any down South. The brisket was leaner and more tender than most, you could cut this stuff with a fork. The green beans were definitely homemade with potatoes, onions, and lots of ham. The BBQ beans were likewise quite tasty with a bit of a spicy flavor and included onions and peppers. The pulled pork might have been the best of all, it was lean and tender with a BBQ sauce with a spicy, slightly garlic flavor. Oh and this comes with a large cornbread muffin too. The portion sizes here are MASSIVE, I was hungry and still was able to eat maybe 3/4 my meal at best.  This place is in the middle of a residential area so you'll think your GPS is steering you wrong but you're going the right way. I'll be back here as I enjoy no frills BBQ.",

I have been going there over 15 years. They provide quality meat and product. Very friendly, many of the same customers go there and have been for many of years. This place is still a gem but most people go for the barbeque which is awesome but haven't realized this is an awesome butcher also. I really highly recommend this butcher.",

I will say when you get there you have to drive by people and get it line it took about 10 minutes to get our food but it was worth the wait .

It's also on dirt which you will get in your car unless your wearing booties ( this is why I took one star out ).  Prepare to wait in line,  I came once right when they opened and there were already 6 people in front of me.  Now to the food:  The sides are all good ! I love the green beans the best.  The brisket melts in your mouth and the hot links are delicious.  I also catered here twice on two occasions.  They do not cater on Sunday's so you will have to get a cold order but they give you heating instructions and it still tasted as good the next day.  They even inform you what to order and what not to order (if you do a cold order) which was very helpful.  Overall,  I like this a lot better than rolling smokes bbq (kind of different, but pretty much the same) due to the sides being just as good as the meats.",

But that's fine, I'm not expecting five star service at a butcher's shop or an open air BBQ cart.  What I am expecting is my order to be correct.  Not close enough, not what we've decided to give you. What I order.  My first experience was not great. My order was just a couple things and the quality was not that great. But everyone said give them another try so I made the mistake and did.  I thought maybe I got the wrong things last time and widened my order. And didn't get my order, because a full half of my order was wrong.  I don't know about you but when I order two steaks cut two inches thick, four steaks cut one third of an inch thick is not acceptable.  When I order ground pork, I do not want bulk house sausage.  And of course, because everything is wrapped where you can t monitor it, you don't find out until it is too late.  Their prices may be fine but the quality is grocery store level and at least the grocery store gets my order right.  I will stick with other butchers in town. They may not provide some of the cuts I want and refuse to do custom orders, but at least I won't be wasting my money.",

Some time ago I was researching a place to cater a lunch for some co-workers.  After deciding that BBQ was in order I hit the yellow pages.  Found my way down to John Mull's Meats and gave them a call.  Even though it sounded like they were busy the helpful woman that I spoke to took all the time necessary to set up the catering.  Now some years later, and many, many excellent visits later I can heartily recommend this fine family owned business.  The owner and all the staff are friendly, hospitable, and seem to really enjoy their work.  Oh and the fruits of their labor are delicious!!!  I recommend any of the lunch specials, especially the hot links, ribs, and brisket.  I particularly enjoy the macaroni and cheese and the baked beans.  Try them out for lunch or catering.  You will not be disappointed!",

This is No Railhead Barbeque in Fort Worth Texas. I do believe Guy is either paid to review some restaurants or his taste buds are numb from all the places he visits.  This is not \"Barbeque\" this is boiled or baked meat. First of all there is no smoke ring, clearly this meat is not smoked AT ALL. I really looked forward to eating at this place...boy was I disappointed. It was dry, luke warm and expensive. I don't mind paying for good food, however I was robbed. I should have know when I saw the staff pulling the meet from a water bath.  How anyone thinks that this is Barbeque is sadly mistaken. We have a whole tray of food left and I don't even think I want to torture a homeless person with this terrible food. I would be doing society a favor if I just threw it away. Don't eat here, don't waste your money. I wanted to take my food back and get my money back, however my husband would not let me make a scene. Only reason I am giving one star is because they gave us free water and the cornbread was good.  Railhead in Fort Worth Texas YOU ARE TRULY THE BEST!!!",

I will most certainly be back as I only live about a mile and a half from this fine eaterie. As you can see I only gave John's four stars and I'll tell you why. First of all, I was very impressed with the person taking my order. Very friendly smile, helpful, patient and was very knowledgable in the menu as I explained I was feeding two people. I could see the line of folks ahead of me waiting patiently for their order to be prepared. As I moved further up the line I could sense a strange calm but also a kind of tense energy. I felt as if I was at a wake. All you could hear was the sound of food being placed in the to-go containers. No talking, no smiles, no fun, nothing but a dull silence. I wondered why and I found out when I handed my ticket to my not so eager server. Every person working on that trailer should have been wearing a Tshirt that said \" I Am a Proud Member of the APATHETIC Club of America \" Not a hello, how are you, have a nice day, I hope you come back soon, tell your friends and not one smile.  \" Hey John \" you have a great thing going on here in Vegas and people come from far and wide to enjoy your cuisine, but please start hiring TEAM members who will hopefully understand that customer service with a smile will bring folks back. I really didn't like writing this review but I think I spoke for every person that was in front of me this afternoon.",

I live across town and do not mind driving over here to eat. The eating area is outdoors which is the only drawback. It's just too damn hot in the summer here in Vegas to be eating out doors. Besides that, the food is great and I highly recommend this place!",

Search is the key word for this place, hidden in a residential area. The owner can usually be seen in the butcher shop showing off his knife skills. Full BBQ menu, I went with the hot link sandwich (a whole link on the roll and another sliced up on top), with a side it was definitely a meal. No inside seating but plenty of covered seating outside. Well worth the search!!",

Fogettaboutit I had to rethink my mac and cheese and baked beans after trying theirs.  I can't wait until June for my annual Vegas vacation to get back to John's on Saturday night with my Dad.  I think my Dad's take on it summed it up quite well on the drive back to the Strip.  It's a few miles off the Strip and...just GPS it, it's well worth it.  I asked Dad, \"was it worth the trek from the Strip?\"  His reply... \"Hmmm...I suppose.\"  Lol.  That's my Dad's way of saying \"HELL YES!!!  I haven't had barbeque that good since I was a kid when my pop and uncles used to bbq.\"  I think I'll get two 3 meat plates to have leftovers all weekend.  Loves me some goooooooooood BBQ!!!",

Great crew of people down there, THEY know what they are doing, before you do.  As far as the RKGrill...come hungry, the 2 meat combo puts me into a coma.  Get there early on Saturday's, the line get ridiculous for lunch and supper.  My fav's are the brisket and ribs, with the mac'n cheese and baked beans...don't forget to leave room for their desserts (I never have room...doggy bag). It's well worth it!

    "text": "Ate at John Mulls (3/23/2016) again, and their food is still very good.  I had forgotten how good the Baked Beans are.  The beans are the best I've eaten anywhere.  The place is  hard to find but worth the search.  I've eaten at John Mull's  twice recently (4-1-2014).  The ribs, tri-tips, sausage were excellent.  The Mac N  Cheese was very good and potato salad was good.  The portions filled the Styrofoam container.  The only complaint I have is the way this place is set up to serve the customer.  It is small, always crowded and takes more time than it should to get your food and pay, then either use  the back door to leave or weave through the crowd  back out the front door.  With all the money they seem to make, you'd think they would come up with a better system to make it easier to get your food and pay without the hassle.   There are tables set up outside to eat your order if you wish, but beware of windy days.  Prepare to wait and be a little confused  when you try this place but the food is good and it is what it is.",

They give really healthy portions so we Just split the two meat option. I love the pulled pork and my husband likes the brisket. Both are great. The people who work there are always really friendly even in the Las Vegas heat and are always hard at work. Be prepared for lines and a wait especially around lunch time. Keep in mind also there is only outdoor seating available, so if you are with someone who shouldn't be out in the heat, consider asking for the food to go. To be honest the seating/eating arrangement isn't my favorite. But the food is so good how can you pass it up. We also really like the Jonny cakes. I am pretty sure they are made in house and are really tasty too. John Mull's has a pretty big fan following as well as I have met people from California all the way to South Carolina that make John Mull's their must visit list when them come to Vegas. Whether you are from out of town or a local, it is worth a visit!",

Waited in line for hour plus during which I'm thinking there has to be a better and faster way to move these people through the line. Got the order to go. On drive home was saying this better be good to justify me standing in line for so long. Got home and split up the two three piece combos between wife and son. It truly was the best bbq I have ever had. All three of us were blown away. How do they serve food this good just slopping it out of a portable bbq trailer? It really is incredible. Four stars just because I'm still a little miffed at having to wait so long. Food is absolutely 5+ stars.",

I was not impressed and, moreover, a little disappointed.    I ordered a three meat combo with sliced hotlinks, pork ribs, and brisket.  The sauce was a little much on the hotlinks, the pork ribs were dry and seemed like they had been sitting for a few hours, and the brisket did not have any smoke flavor.    The portion of side orders were more than adequate, but one really does not come to a bar-b-que place for the sides, does one?",

But, it was worth the drive across town!    I'll be back when they open up the barbeque shack.  By the way, they should have had the barbeque restaurant open  before they ran the Groupon Promotion.  They would have generated a lot of revenue.",
