The service is a different story here. For a group of 5 that is spending $1,000.00 for dinner, you would think the sever would be on top of there game. Very little check in, had to ask multiple time to get refills and clear plates from our table... What a shame",

    "text": "Talk about an over priced meal! I can't sugar coat this review whatsoever because I truly had high hopes for this place! I always hear so many mixed opinions about Ruth Chris and always wanted to try! I finally had the chance to experience this place this past weekend! My cousin celebrated her birthday here in Vegas and I thought what better opportunity to grab a nice dinner! She had been to Ruth Chris in another city so I wasn't as hesitant to try it out! Booked my reservation online through opentable as normal. Upon arriving we were greeted promptly by a nice hostess and seated in a perfect table against the window to overlook the strip! So far so good! The waiter was nice recommended us a couple of their signature Martinis. We chose the red velvet cupcake and the seduce me! Both prepared excellent! Here is where things start to take a turn! After reviewing the menu for some time my cousin decided on their 3 course meal which she ordered the Caesar salad and the salmon! Her dish was fantastic! My order was the Cowboy Ribeye Steak w/ blue cheese crumbles. Now let me start by saying I am a True steak person and I know an excellent steak when I get one. I was very underwhelmed with this $61 steak because the taste was so bland and there was a ton of fat on this cut! I have had steaks extremely better at like 35 Steaks & Martinis or even Delmonico or something! I had to ask myself how is it that they nailed the Salmon dish but completely missed the steak!? A dish that they are supposedly specializing in? By far the worst I've had! No $61 steak should just be average! I had to keep in good spirits because of my cousins birthday but lastly how about this terrible quadruple chocolate cake they give out on birthdays? It's WAY too much chocolate matter of the fact I don't even think it's cake! It's basically a fudge bar! In summary I pretty much wasted $200 on an average ass meal! I'll never return! My first time will be the last.. Period!",

The decor and venue are top quality and relaxing, we settled down and ordered prime sliders and steak sandwich.    My friend devoured her sliders as if she had not eaten in a week (I happen to know she went out to lunch that day, so hunger was not the reason).  The sizzling steak smell wafts through the restaurant and her inner carnivore was triggered.  My steak sandwich was divine.  They take the ends of the filet mignon and cut into big chunks.  Cooked perfectly, extremely tender, and full of Ruth Chris flavor.    Our waiter, Jonathan, was very attentive and we did not have to ask for anything.  Water, bread and appropriate attention was provided for our 3 hour chat-fest.  We've decided this is currently our favorite spot in LV, though our research continues.    A visit by the manager with personal invitation to return was our final hoorah for this restaurant and location.  We will be back soon!",

The steak was so good, I didn't bother with the bread or the two side dishes we ordered! Service is top shelf and expected in a place like this. If you've never been to a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, you've got to try it. I highly recommend reservations. FYI: Restaurant is located in the run down Harrah's Casino, but they are a separate entity entirely. You take a special elevator to the second floor and when the door opens, you're in the restaurant. Windows all around. View of courtyard between the hotels is stunning. Neon everywhere, very Las Vegas!",

My deal was for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 side, 1 dessert, and a bottle of wine for $119 plus tip. It was worth it. If I didn't have the deal I would not get that much food but everything I had was good. The steak was so tender and flavorful. For my appetizer we got spicy lobster. I don't generally eat lobster but I tried it and I liked it. The spicy sauce was really good on it. Our side was mashed potatoes. One is definitely large enough to share. Also I have to have potatoes when I have steak. The potatoes were thick and not lumpy and garlic and buttery. The dessert was the chocolate explosion. It was good but I was stuffed at this point. I would totally go back but one thing to remember is that they have a dress code that is enforced, so don't try to come in a t shirt.",

The food was just as good as one expects from Ruth's Chris (that is, excellent) and I was equally impressed both by the lamb chops I had on the first visit and the sea bass that I had on the second visit. The cocktails are also quite tasty. The service was excellent and timely during both visits.  Taking off one star because during our first visit I was given medium well lamb chops instead of the medium rare that I ordered. They did replace it, but by that time my partner had finished his meal, which made our experience a little less enjoyable.",

Our server came right over and took our drink orders, we ordered appetizers which came out pretty fast. The appetizers were pretty much the highlight of our meal. We had the spicy lobster which was very good and the calamari that was just as good. And then our entrees came and the whole thing went south on us. I had the 16oz Ribeye which wasn't great at all, the steak was cooked ok but it was lacking flavor. My wife ordered the 20oz lobster which was huge but it was overcooked.

    "text": "I have been a regular at Ruth's Chris Steak house since 1990's. I was regular at the Palm Desert, then Woodland Hills and Phoenix area. Las Vegas location is hard to get in and out, so it took me 6 years to finally find it.  As expected quality is consistent, corn fed beef are brilliant, service is prompt and professional. I was however somewhat disappointed by the wine list. I hope they have a greater and larger selection of wine.  It is a tragedy when you eat such a juicy steak with average wine.  I hope my next visit I get to see more extensive wine list. If you have not been to This Steak House I suggest you find one close to you and try.",

We had a wonderfully delicious meal, including gumbo , Caesar salad, steaks, potatoes, and cheesecake for dessert. Yum! We even had the raspberry and rosemary cosmos. I am not a lover of cosmos, but this may be the most perfectly blended drink I ever had. I had one the only other time I went to Ruth's Chris in Detroit, and it was as good as I remembered. My boyfriend, who is quick to let you know if he found shortcomings in a restaurant, had only positive things to say. Thank you for living up to my expectations and impressing my man!! He had never been, and he did not even squawk at the bill.....always a plus",

He was courteous and very attentive. we ultimately had a great time and the service was awesome!   Great food and fantastic service!

No problem -- they quickly offered to replace it. I got another just a few minutes later. The problem was the meat seemed to be low quality. It was cooked properly, but very stringy and fatty. I heard from friends that this is intentional \"marbling\", but I did not enjoy it as much as a typical steak. I had maybe 5 or 6 bites that were pure beef. The rest all had lots of fat. I've made many steaks myself at home that were better than this $67 ribeye. The mashed potatoes were typical and a bit more bland than I expected. I had some nice neighbors who offered their mac & cheese with lobster -- holy cow was that amazing. But it was bittersweet that that exceeded the satisfaction of my entree and side. It's a really high-class establishment, but I expect greatness when the steak is $67. I did not receive greatness, so I give 3 stars.",

The potatoes we're delish and the steak was out of this world.  We finished with the chocolate duo which included a chocolate lava cake and chocolate moose = heaven.   Our servers were attentive and we were in great hands.    The only downside was the price.  Our shared dinner with tip was $210.  No regrets, I'd order again!",

    "text": "Okay. So a bit disappointed in my visit, especially after all the rave I hear on the joint. The service was top notch. We had reservations at got seated within a few minutes.  Each person from host, wait staff, and manager were all very nice and professional. We definitely felt as we were attended to. (4.4/5) The problem and deduction in rating was the food, unfortunately.  We each ordered the filet, medium well, and we ordered two sides to share. The filets came out sizzling hot and looked and smelled so good.  We cut into each and we noticed a huge difference. One was pretty red, and mine was, well, brown.  It was still edible and it is hard for me to send food back to any kitchen (we all know why there is anxiety sending food back.) when our waitress came back around I showed her the difference and she acknowledged that they were not cooked the same. She said it looked like one was underdone and the other a little over cooked. The manager did a round checking on tables as well. I let her know I was enjoying my meal, but did point out the difference.  She was surprised at the difference and offered to correct the mistake. I will admit, I did not ask for a correction.  But when we are paying $210 for two (2 filets, 2 sides total, and three glasses of wine total), it should really come out right the first time.  And since it didn't, a server or manager should try to make it right in another way as it should be known that some guests are not comfortable sending food back.  Maybe comp a slice of cake? Or not charge for one of the filets....just saying. Service was good good, food was blah, issue resolution skills could use some improvement. Unfortunately, at this price, I'm unsure to return.",

    "text": "Start with the good stuff. The server was really attentive, and had a very good sense of humor (which I really appreciate at a restaurant). Our orders arrived remarkably quickly. The food was yummy. We started with the Caesar salad which was tasty.  We each had filet mignon (both cooked to perfection). We had sides of Lyonnaise potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce. The hollandaise sauce actually was very good.  We did not get dessert.  Now why I didn't give more than 3 stars:   (a) when I made our reservation on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a>, I couldn't get anything earlier than 8:00 p.m. (They open at 5:00pm. I wanted 7:00 or 7:30pm). When we arrived, however, the place was over 2/3 empty (it was the night of the Grammys);   (b) my \"petit\" filet mignon cost $42, my friend's regular filet (which wasn't any larger than mine) was $55. All we got was the steaks. No sides. Not even some kind of sauce other than ketchup or A1 (Flemings at least offers a selection of Au Juice, etc.).  They said the sides we ordered were big enough to share. They were not even close. The portion barely reached the top of each small serving dish. For the prices they were charging it should have been overflowing.  In short, we got more food, for (literally) about 1/4 the price at the Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian;  (c) I have been to several Ruth's Chris steakhouses. Each of them has a very similar feel of a  high-end, classy steak house (big private booths, warm wood colors, etc).  This location clearly had been cheaply jerry-rigged out of a prior restaurant. While it looked nice enough, perhaps, to be a \"Ruby Tuesday's\" location, it looked nothing like what you would expect from a Ruth's Chris; and   (d) To get to the restaurant you needed to park in a lot that was, at best, sketchy and nasty, and then walk through a hotel (Harrah's) that is (or should be) two days away from a wrecking ball and a week-long environmental decontamination project.  Although there certainly should have been, sadly there was not one of those hand sanitizer dispensers outside the elevators to the restaurant",

Make reservations ahead of time, you wont have to wait. Finding the elevator to reach it is a little tricky but just follow the signs throughout the casino and go one floor up. Food was really good!!!!",

He made a reservation us in the lounge at a beautiful table overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.  I look forward to seeing Caesar on my trips to Las Vegas. I know him as a man of integrity who understands quality customer service from his work at the Bellagio and Paris.  This was my girlfriend's first trip to Las Vegas and exposing her to the excellence that I have come to know here was paramount. I knew i could count on Caesar. Ruth's Chris signature culinary techniques are outstanding and the atmosphere was intimate and comfortable. The evening was even better than I had hoped for. Thank you Caesar, we will be back.",

The wine list sufficient, but unimpressive.   The food? Well, it was only \"ok\". The dinner was good, and nowhere near bad, but it wasn't a $60 steak either. The potatoes au gratin were cheesy blandness and the asparagus stalks were fibrous and tough.  As a local there are many fantastic steakhouses in Vegas that will knock your socks off. Some are more expensive than here, some less. The point is the food here is less than average when compared to its peers.   I wouldn't fault anyone for going to Ruth Chris', but I wouldn't recommend it either.",

It seems their prices are much higher than every other RC I have been to. The Ruth Classic three course meal was priced at About $79+ whereas it is $55 at every other steakhouse. We asked for an upgraded cheesecake and the server was confused and we never got the cheesecake. Steak was cooked medium well, not medium as we had asked. They failed to take a group or offer to take a group pic when 4 people in the group had birthdays , and only 3 birthday cakes were served. For the price we pay for dinner, we do not expect Outback Steakhouse or Sizzler service. We expect high end, flawless service. This was not the case here. Very disappointed overall with the service for our party of 10. $1500 tab, was wasted. Not to mention the $40 cork fee we were charged, it is normally $15 at every other RC.",

The lamb chops were seasoned PERFECTLY.  I would definitely order them again.  The wedge salad was basically half a head of lettuce...this is fine because it is a wedge salad after all...but you will likely have to ask for more dressing to cover the big gaudy wedge.  The waiter did fairly well...he was really running around a lot and it was hard to get his attention.  When it came time to pay the bill he forgot to give us a pen to sign with...we had to wait a little while until he finished running around (literally running) to get his attention for the pen.  No biggie though.  I took off two stars because the prices are nearly double what I have paid at Ruth Chris in other locations.  I understand it is Vegas and on the strip but I still have to deduct a few points for that.  If I had the extra money to spare and really had a taste for lamb chops, I would visit again.",

We rant and rave about Ruth's Chris to all our friends and family, like \"If you want a perfect steak, you gotta go to Ruth's Chris...period.\" That's just the steak though, which by the way is always cooked to perfection and so flavorful and comes out literally sizzling on your plate *mouth watering* you will never have to add a pinch of salt or even a sprinkle of black pepper. The asparagus with the hollandaise sauce is always on point, the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad was so fresh with the fresh cracked black pepper from the waiter, YESS *finger snap!* The brussel sprouts and bacon is always a great choice. This time we tried the sweet potato casserole with the pecan crust oh my gahhhh, never NOT going to order this again. We've never been disappointed. We get seated quickly, our waiter is always ontopofit, food always comes out on time, and drinks stay full. The only down side to dinner at this location (Las Vegas) was that they didn't do a personalized menu with our names and anniversary date because they are one of the \"franchise locations\" as explained to us, that's it though. Another perfect anniversary dinner for us, yay!",

    "text": "The Happy Hour at Ruth Chris in Harrah's Las Vegas is way overpriced and the food we ordered is best described as plain and mediocre. All food and drinks including wine (not beer) are $12. (Late August 2018) Hey it's RC so you're thinking, I'll get a great steak sandwich and it'll be worth it. Not True. The hamburger was better than the steak sandwich but even it was small, about the size of a Fast food burger. It did come with average tasting fries. We went with friends and their steak sandwich was just as plain, thin and on yucky French roll type bread. We saw other tables taking the bread off and putting it on an empty plate. What does that tell you? Can't remember anything else being on the sandwich and couldn't identify the type of steak it was other than bland and easily forgettable.   The atmosphere is quite pleasant and windows face the Strip. However, the HH is only from 5-6 pm and you must take an elevator to reach the restaurant which may mean you may not find a seat/table in the bar where the HH is if there's a line to get into the elevator. We got one of the last tables available so we ended up waiting a long time to get our food even though we arrived before 5. That may have been the servers fault because the food wasn't that hot.   The other reason I would not recommend the RC HH is because there are other restaurants that serve better bar food and drinks at a much more affordable price. One is Tommy Bahama's at Town Square and if you want an above the Strip place go to Maggiano's. I wouldn't say don't go to other RC HH's because they may live up to the hype. Unfortunately, the Ruth Chris HH at Harrah's was a big disappointment for us and our friends.",

The restaurant is actually very nice and not what you might expect to find in Harrah's. You can get to the restaurant by using an elevator on the casino floor. There's a big sign, so you can't miss it. Depending on what side of the restaurant you're on, they have a nice view of the strip.  The filet mignon was pretty good (I added shrimp) but the lobster mac n cheese was probably the worst I've ever had. Service was decent but not great. My biggest complaint was how unprofessional the hostess and another employee were before we even sat down. As we were walking back, we passed the two of them yelling at each other over something work related and the F word was used. I could not believe she was cussing someone out on the floor. Needless to say, that was a horrible first impression.",

Our server told us at the end of our dinner that they were not expecting such a large amount of people dining there that day so they weren't meeting a lot of expectations. However, our party thought everything went very well! If that was a bad night for them, I can't imagine how much more amazing they could be on a regular day!  I ordered the lamb chops (3 THICK pieces of lamb) on a 500 degree sizzling plate. Ugh it was so delicious that my mouth is watering as I am typing. My boyfriend ordered the cowboy bone-in rib eye steak and that was also very tasty. Both of our meats were cooked perfectly medium rare as requested. We shared three sides with our friends which is perfect! If you go with a large party, definitely consider sharing your sides so that you all can try a little bit of everything!   Calamari: I feel like this appetizer is a must everywhere I go but this one is by far one of the best I've had. Squeeze as much lemon as you want. The more the better IMO!  Lobster mac & cheese: extra cheesy and a piece of lobster in every bite almost.  Sweet potato casserole: I feel like we can do without. It was very sweet that day. I've had it before at another location and I thought it was delicious. However, I regret ordering this one on that day.   Blackberry sidecar: Very strong but the flavor is still pretty good for how strong it was.  For our friend's birthday, they gave him a slice of cheesecake on the house.  Please check their website for proper dress code. It isn't that strict, but you might want to check before you arrive just in case!",

    "text": "Sorry to ruin the 5 star streak, but I have my own opinions. To start off, what can I say. The place is nice and everything is what it should be for a steak house in Las Vegas. Their menu is short giving you a few options, although it's short it has all the necessary items. They have everything from Ruth's favorite, family sized sides, big and petite steaks, kids menu, and deserts. I ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, 40 oz porterhouse for two (medium rare), and lobster Mac n Cheese as a side. Let's start with the shrimp cocktail. It came with cocktail sauce, salad, and 4 jumbo sized shrimp. The shrimp with plump and soft. Supremely sweet and perfect with the sauce as it's sidekick. Next the main event the steak. I got the porterhouse because it gives me two different cuts of steaks. The filet and strip. I must say presentation was pretty awful for this dish. The steak was cut up with 3 chunks on either side and had this massive bone just nuzzled in between. The steak was so dry that I unfortunately had to dip the steak in A1, one side was more brown than the other, it was ice cold when I bit into it. The steaks color transitioning of medium rare was totally uneven and instead a target color type of steak instead of a sea of red. Lastly the lobster Mac n cheese. The presentation was average. What more can you expect from Mac and cheese. The macaroni itself was good, however a little to soft and past al dente. The cheese was completely set and not gooey when it got to my table. However the star of this dish, the lobster should go back into the sea. First of all, the lobster was not fresh. You were biting the sea instead of a succulent plump and sweet piece of lobster. Overall overcooked pasta, cold cheese, and fishy lobster do not go well together. The service here is spot on, so is the setting. What makes this place deserve a 2 star is the food and the price that comes with it.   Update: I have spoken with the manager and he has resolved my issue.",

Unfortunately,  the food was not good (or at least mine wasn't). In all fairness,  I didnt have much of an appetite after eating at Harrahs hotel buffet earlier that afternoon,  so I wasn't in the mood for a heavy steak. The waitress suggested the scallops as it was a fairly small portion. My husband who was actually starving ordered the stuffed chicken and thought it was pretty good,  but my scallops arrived and after one bite,  I immediately spit them out because it was extremely SALTY. Our server immediately tried to rectify the situation and offered to make them again or order something else on the menu,  but by this time,  I had already eaten about half the sweet potato casserole and a good portion of the creamed spinach,  both which were delicious by the way,  so I declined and she was gracious enough to take them off the bill.  Overall,  I would probably not try this restaurant again,  it's pricey and we weren't super impressed,  but maybe we just caught them on a bad day...who knows.",

My GF's ribeye was really good as well nice and tender cut like butter.  Overall the food was good, but I think it was overpriced.

    "text": "As you can tell from my other reviews, I have frequented Ruth's Chris Steak House locations all over the country. Overall, this experience was on-par with other locations. The food is consistent. We ordered a petite filet and stuffed chicken breast with the usual sides and found the steak was well prepared and all of our dishes were good. We had some type of banana pudding desert and it wasn't one of the best we have had at a Ruth's Chris. We sat by a window and had a great view of the strip. The service was a bit slow and our server was less than attentive (refills were slow, etc.) but we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a huge deal. One of the biggest disappointments, at least to me: the soup of the day was some type of a seafood soup as was the regular menu soup. I would have preferred to see an alternative to a seafood soup offered, just a personal thought.  The restaurant is located in Harrah's and it was a bit difficult for us to find. You have to take an elevator that is in the middle of the Harrah's casino. If you follow the signs, you will be fine. We overheard the waiter telling another table that this is the largest Ruth's Chris in the nation, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily felt any different than other locations, other than perhaps being a bit more casual.",

It was our anniversary and they dressed up our table and that was a nice touch.  We split the Bone in Filet Mignon and a couple of side dishes, everything was just perfect and delicious.  I can say I have never been disappointed at any Ruth's Chris Steak House over the many times I have visited them for dinners.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a very good stake dinner.",

I was given a menu with one price then given another menu with different prices. My daughter's steak was incorrectly cooked, I was overcharged for my salad and the calamari was cold. Everything went wrong . The waiter Randy kept making mistakes. The manager Anthony was not much better. To top it off when I went to pick up my car, I mentioned the problem to parking attendant and he said that many people had complained about Ruth's Chris at Harrah's. The quality has gone way down. I plan to complain with the parent company.",

Our server, Jennifer, was very attentive and did an excellent job--along with our busser, Kharoline.  A short time after taking our orders, a basket of warm bread was delivered to our table.  Both my husband and I ordered the petite filet mignon.  It was served to us sizzling hot and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered three side dishes--corn, sweet potato casserole, and augratin potatoes.  All three side dishes were delicious.  We planned to order a dessert to take home, but Jennifer served us a complimentary mini raspberry cheesecake with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate across the plate.  Our dining experience at RC did not disappoint.  It was wonderful from start to finish!",

We are from NY and have been to many upscale steak houses and this by far was the best experience. The hostesses we're extremely friendly when we checked into our reservation. Since it was our anniversary they put rose petals on our table and gave us complimentary dessert. The food was beyond this world. Cooked exactly how we requested with so much flavor. Lastly, our waiter Johnny was terrific to say the least! He was personable, absolutely hysterical and knowledgeable on every item on the menu! Any establishment is better when you have service like this! Thank you Johnny for a fabulous experience!",

We've been to the original in New Orleans but this one in Vegas, which over looks the center of the strip is truly great and what makes it great is the service.  Our server, made the experience.  We came back a second night and requested her, Darcel!!!  She is pleasant, jovial and she will help you navigate the menu like an  expert. She is absolutely amazing and she makes the experience. The second night we brought our friends with us.  We ordered the porter house for two, rare.  It was amazing.  The filet side was was tender and rich.  The steak side a little more chewy, savory and with a distinct aged flavor.  You can taste the butter.  Absolutely served to perfection with a smile. We had the mash potatoes and creamed spinach both steakhouse staples and both excellent. A can't miss in Vegas for steak fans.  If you want the truly exceptional experience book your reservation with Darcel for lots of laughs and wonderfully augmented selections.",

    "text": "My eyes sparkled at the sight of a deliciously juicy steak on a sizzling buttery hot plate. My heart beat raced and I felt elated being in a steak house ready to feast. And then a group of 4 girls dubbed \"the hostesses\" got between me and my juicy meaty love and brought me to a screeching halt.   Wait what?   I don't know what it is with their high school drama, but one of them checked our reservation and asked another one to take us to our table. The other one frowns and says, \"No I took the last one.\" The others diverted their gaze, like clueless students not wanting to be picked by the professor. Silence fell upon us. Awkward, with a capital A. A few minutes passes as the 4 went on with their drama.  Finally, one of them grew up and took the menus and took us to our table.  I watched them in amusement but one more minute away from my juicy steak and I am ready to kick butt. Professionalism should tell you, don't pull that in front of the customers. But the rest of the experience was as smooth as steak knife through butter.    And now to the food:   Spicy Lobster- Succulent pieces of lobster, lightly fried, tossed in a spicy cream sauce. Delicious! The perfect balance of tender lobster, a nice crisp exterior, and a great sauce with just the right hint of spicy. The cucumber salad that came with it wasn't all too impressive. I would've liked a more crispy bite for the cucumbers and less of that a stale and vinegar taste.   Ribeye- Came sizzling on a hot plate and drenched in butter. Juicy, melts in your mouth, with a delicious buttery taste. Nice marbling. Cooked perfectly. I had the medium and it was cooked evenly and with just the right hint of pink. This is why I love Ruth's Chris. So good. The only con is that it is also incredibly heavy. I already started feeling full after a few bites. But it's soooo good so I kept going for the sake of my mouth.  Potatoes Au Gratin- sliced potatoes with a three cheese sauce. This one wasn't too memorable and rather mediocre. I don't know what it is with amazing steak houses and mediocre side dishes. I had a similar experience with another steak house of similar caliber.   Chocolate Explosion- chocolate molten cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Pretty good and a nice way to end a meal.     My last dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse was in Pasadena, California. This being my first time visit to the one in Las Vegas, I didn't know what to expect. The first impression made by the hostesses wasn't all too promising. Luckily, the rest of the experience made up for it and was exactly the same. Our servers were extremely friendly and constantly checked our table to make sure everything is perfect. Amazing service.   Would I come here again? Yes please!",

We only liked the view and the dessert. But honestly, you really do go for the steak! We were gravely disappointed. Our waiter was very nice but it's the steak that ruined it for us! First of all, everything is a la carte. We ordered 2 filets with a side of lobster Mac and cheese. My husband's filet was over done for medium rare and both steaks were bland! They did warn us that it only comes with butter and salt and pepper (encouraging guests to spend even more on toppings!) As if $60+ is not enough for one tasty filet? The steaks were charred and dry on the outside. Hence the melted butter! Honestly my husband said my filets seared on a hot iron skillet with appropriate seasonings are way better! I cook all our food myself and we rarely eat out. We rarely eat red meat as it IS a culprit of bad health. I was sad to know I cannot even take them to my dogs as we stayed in a hotel with no fridge. :( We couldn't finish our steaks and it was a huge waste of money. Not to mention, Harrah's made it hospitable with raw sewage smell as we exited the hotel the restaurant was located in. My God what an awful experience!",

At the request of my mom (she was my plus one at the Elite event and was very impressed), we celebrated my brother's birthday at Ruth's Chris a couple of weeks ago.  Please be forewarned that there is no valet or self parking anywhere near Ruth's Chris.  It's at the exact opposite of all the entrances if you are arriving by car.    The one star is for the decoration of the restaurant, but that was it.  From the bread, the 400 degree hot plate of bone-in ribeye, to our server's unkempt attire, it was not the \"upscale\" experience, food or service, Ruth's Chris is supposed to be.    By no mean am I trying to be a snob about the whole affair.  I think I am capable of adjusting my standards based on where I am at.  However, for the price and the service, I'd take my dollar right next door to the Caesar's Palace Joe's Stonecrab and be a happier customer.",

We showed up about 45 minutes before HH ended, so we ended up rushing to order drinks, our food, and an additional round, but it was well worth it. I had the Filet sandwich, which was just delightful, with the white wine butter sauce and the garlic bread, what a great HH meal for like $12 also all beers were $5 IN VEGAS. WHAT A STEAL.   Also a pro tip from a friend of mine who is a big time Ruth Chris aficionado, if you do the Filet sandwich at HH and order it with no bread it comes out the same as the high dollar filet usually would, and you saved about $40-50.   We caught a little attitude from our waiter at the end of our meal, so that cost them a star, but it is what it is. Other than that, for this being my first time at a Ruth Chris, I was thoroughly impressed.",

I gave 4 stars because the mashed potatoes were a little overseasoned.  Come on, you can do better than that guys! Weve eaten at other upscale steak restaurants but it's True what they say when it comes to steak, THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that we've been to Ruth Chris Steak Houses in many locations and almost without exception, we've had good experiences. We also ate numerous times at The Range before it was converted to a Ruth's Chris. And we always had great food and excellent service there. However, our two dining experiences at this Ruth's Chris have been disappointing. The service was fine in both cases, but the food wasn't. Both times, my steak came out incorrectly prepared. I know that a medium rare steak has a 'cool red center' .... not a squishy purple / red center. The last time we were there -- on New Year's Eve -- my husband's steak was properly prepared. Mine was squishy and purple inside. I sent it back and they then cooked it to medium well. So they then prepared a new one and it came out with gristle in several spots. Not what you expect for the price. But by then, my husband was almost done with his meal and I didn't want to send it back again so I just ate it. They did make the changes graciously but given the experience and the fact that it was New Year's Eve, I think it would have been appropriate to offer something else, whether a desert or to comp drinks or something. There are too many great steakhouses in Vegas for us to ever come back to this one.",

    "text": "Oooh! A fancy steakhouse!....Cynthia likes!! =) Ruth Chris is located on the second level of Harrah's casino level. If you ever get lost or have no idea where to find the elevators that would take you up to Ruth Chris, don't hesitate to ask an employee. Parked his car in valet because it was quick and convenient.   This place isn't cheap....the two of us ran the bill to about $200.00. But of course, appetizers, soup and salad and wine were ordered as well as our entrees + side dishes. I ordered the lobster bisque soup while my date ordered a wedge salad.  LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP: My soup was delicious. Although...I think they used a mushroom based broth (if that makes any sense) because I don't like mushrooms and I can recognize that distinct mushroom taste. And it was certainly in my soup. Yucky but it wasn't unbearable.  PETITE FILET MIGNON: The petite is 8 oz. and the larger size is 11 oz. My date and I both ordered the 8 oz. and it was PERFECT sized. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!! The flavoring and seasoning they cooked their steaks with were perfect! Even though I ordered my filet (and any steaks) WELL DONE...it wasn't dried at all. Each bite completely melts in my mouth. You can tell the quality here is ON POINT.  NOTE: Your steaks and any other entrees do not come with any other side dishes. So if you want mashed potatoes or veggies....you gotta order it. Each dish is more than enough to share between two grown adults.  POTATOES AU GRATIN: I'm a sucker for all potatoes. So potatoes with cheese melted on top? UMMM....THIS is like an orgasm in my mouth!!!! Amazing side dish! Must order if you're in love with potatoes like me.  SAUTEED SPINACH WITH GARLIC: Don't be afraid of the garlic...there was only a small hint of the taste. Definitely not strong enough to leave any garlic breath.  Service was great the entire night. They were attentive to our drinks and kept checking back on us throughout the night to see how everything is going. The dessert menu was offered at the end of our meals but we were just too full. He recommended the banana cream pie? Sooo....perhaps you can give that a try?    Also, this is a fancy restaurant. My date and I were dressed to the nines but I did see a couple people in very casual attire. Come on guys. Please dress the part. Don't come to a $$$$ steakhouse and wear something that belongs to a $ establishment.",

Once I got into my room, I realized RC closed at 10 p.m....on a Friday. I think that is way to early. But, I hustled to get ready and get down there.  I was by myself so I went to the bar. The bartender, Ron, greeted me and asked how he could help. I told him I was looking for a seat, but there were none. A nice couple moved their stuff to accommodate me. That was nice and they were very animated, so it was enjoyable.  I had the sirloin med, brussel sprouts and a dirty martini. The steak was perfectly prepared and the brussel sprouts were delicious. Ron was friendly and prompt and paid me just the right amount of attention for a solo diner.   I took my leftover food to go, which was a waste since Harrah's has no amenities,such as a fridge, in their upgraded room. But, I enjoyed my visit, my food and the service I received and have come to expect from this location.",

Excellent food and great service, the lobster bisque was a little bitter for my taste and the corn a little too crunchy but that's probably just my opinion. The bread and butter is some of the best I've had since moving to the states. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the mashed potato was to die for. Very generous portions, I had to leave a lot of food so I had room for desert, not polishing off the mash was a real challenge! Molten chocolate lava cake was stunning!  A little expensive but you get what you pay for! Wanted to score it 4-1/2 but that wasn't an option so scored it 5* as it was closer to 5 than to 4. Would recommend.   Very happy chappie!!",

Food was ordered, got my steak it was rare, I asked for it be cooked to medium well. They take the steak back bring it to me and it's still RARE. I am appalled at the service. I've been a frequent customer of R C for ever 30 yrs. there staff is usually has the best customer service ever. They had 3 managers there, one thing I can say is that they all are very nonchalant and not on their waiters at all for the service. I waited for my check go over 30 minutes and still had to ask for it again. I place my cc in the book and the waiter never comes to pick up pymt, i go to the front with my pymt and still wait 30 minutes to sign receipt. Thus is the worst RUTH CHRIS I'VE EVER BEEN TOO.",

But, certain experiences are better than others and the Vegas location delivered on the food and service.  So Well Done!  I came with a team of 5 as part of the CES trade show and we received an A+ booth.  The food was perfect (Ribeyes to Salads to the boring things the vegetarians ordered) and the drinks were great.  I am a very strict connoisseur when it comes to Ruth's Chris and this one is highly recommended.  -eric",

Even the backup servers were not helping. I had to ask numerous times for a refill on a soda & even then it did not show up. Ugh! Definitely not up to Ruth Chris standards. The San Diego locations run circles around this one for much lower menu prices. Thanks but no thanks Vegas location.",

Service is always excellent. Love the ambience and the view is amazing! Had the Cowboy steak which is a rib eye encrusted with blue cheese!! Wholly crap was it great! Sweet potatoes are phenomenal, love the bread and butter, great Caesar salad, Mac n cheese, and mushrooms. Food is great and so is everything else. Great atmosphere for date night or any occasion!",

    "text": "We love Ruth's Cris - usually.  We plan our annual visit to the National Finals Rodeo with the idea of eating at Ruth's Cris one of the nights we are there.  It's a big deal for us.  But not for them.  We had reservations and were truly looking forward to our dining experience. We knew that our bill was going to run well over $400.00, because there would have been three of us, and we were going to splurge.  But we couldn't.  The reason for this is - is that Ruth's Cris called our cell phone and told us it was their \"Slow season\" and if we wanted to change our reservation to an hour earlier, they would book us, otherwise, they were cancelling our reservation.  I told the person that we had come a very long way, had waited a very long time to visit their dining establishment and that the rodeo didn't get over until 9:00pm and we would rush to get there. That's when she told me it was their \"slow season\" and hung up.  There is a Ruth's Cris Steakhouse in Minneapolis, where our daughter lives, it is wonderful.  We will go there. As it was, we went to Lawry's (which was outstanding) and they were more than happy to feed us.  The next night we dined at The Homestead Steakhouse in Caesars Palace.  It was amazing, we recommend the Wedge Salad with the best Ranch Dressing ever and the Rib-eye steak.  They were happy to feed us, too.",

Tom did a great job explaining what was in each dish before and as I enter into my never-to-be-regretted food coma. He also did a great job making sure the rest of the table had a pulse as they stuffed their faces with their steak, green beans with garlic butter, fresh asparagus and Hollandaise, potatoes au gratin, and sauteed mushrooms. We started with Veal Osso Buca Ravioli, which Tom highly recommended, and calamari which were a little mushy. I had the Chicken Breast Stuffed with Herb Cream Cheddar Cheese which there was nothing but half a bone left of, and for our final act we disappeared an exquisite bread pudding. Ta-da!",

    "text": "I would always tell people that the best steak I have ever had was at Harrah's in Las Vegas.  This was in the early 2000s, and I had not eaten there since.  I had been wanting to go back and revisit that same steakhouse to see if it was as good as I remember.  During my most recent visit to Vegas I got to do so, but the steakhouse is now a Ruth's Chris.  I was not too disappointed by the change, as I really liked Ruth's Chris when I dined at the Beverly Hills location.  I looked forward to dining here even more knowing that it was now a Ruth's Chris, and I had only been to one once before.  I tend to keep my orders basic when I go to a higher end steakhouse, and this visit was no exception.  My meal consisted of the filet and sides of the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.  It was all superbly flavorful with great presentation.  The steak was exactly how I wanted it prepared, and the potatoes and spinach were great complements.  The experience was highlighted even further by the attentive service of the excellent staff.  My visit to Ruth's Chris was the most memorable dining experience on my recent trip to Vegas.  It was outstanding from beginning to end with great service, atmosphere, and food.  It may not have been the best steak I have ever had, but it was most definitely in the top 10.  I won't wait over 10 years this time to dine here again!",

My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary and the staff made sure and made us feel very special on our special day. If there's any drawbacks it would be the amount of time spent waiting in between each course. Don't go there thinking you'll be in and out.

I also thought I have had some pretty amazing steaks before, but this was on another level. The lobster bisque was not the best, but good. The loaded baked potato and green beans were boring in comparison. The only side that wowed me was the sweet potato casserole. It is like a dessert, so if you are not into sweet, definitely pass on it. Speaking of dessert, I had the chocolate sin cake, which is a flourless dark chocolate cake with a hint of espresso. Again, not everyone's favorite. I liked it when paired with the strawberry they plated with it. All in all, I didn't feel ripped off at paying over $200 for a meal with no alcohol, which is saying a lot for a plebeian such as myself.",

    "text": "I have been dining in public establishments for nearly 40 years and never have I eaten such an abysmal meal.  Never. This was the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant.  This includes such gems as Taco Bell,  Waffle House, Roberto's (for the late night burrito eaters) McDonald's...this beats them all. Worst meal ever. I feel like Ruth's Chris should win an award for being in such austere company as fast food/drinking food giants.   The evening boded well when we (my father and I) got off the elevator and were led to our table. We had a lovely two top in front of a large picture window that overlooked the Quad and Carnival Court.  Normally this view would be terrible due to the predominance of drunken fools littering the landscape but it was nice because it was dark outside.  Our server was friendly, yet slightly pretentious.   To start, I ordered a Caesar salad and my dad got a lettuce wedge. You know it's a bad Caesar when the very best thing was the shaved cheese on top. It is very hard to mess up shaved cheese. The Caesar salad itself tasted like something you could get at a TGI Fridays restaurant.  Too much dressing, soggy lettuce. As for  the lettuce wedge, Iceberg lettuce is a funny thing.  When it is served cold, it is crisp and refreshing. Unfortunately my father's iceberg lettuce wedge was served lukewarm and limp.    For our meals I ordered seabass with crabmeat and lobster. My father ordered the roasted chicken.  The sea bass was obviously frozen and heated under a broiler.  The edges had freezer burn and the inside was still cold. The \"crab and lobster\" was the crap that comes out of a can that gets mixed with bread crumbs in order to make stuffed mushrooms.  Mmmmm...stuffed mushrooms.  I like them. With real crab. None of that in sight on my plate.  The whole monstrosity was smothered in lousy Knorr-like Hollandaise sauce.  This inedible mess was $42. $42 for undercooked frozen fish sticks covered in sauce.    Las Vegas is a city where fresh seafood is flown in every single day.  There is no excuse for this dish.  The roasted chicken showed up at the table and the first question my dear old dad asked our server was about the Orange Glob seeping out the middle of the chicken.  Fungal disease?  Unicorn poo? What in the name of all that is holy was wrong with that poor chicken? Nothing!  They had stuffed it with cheese sauce!  Cheese Whiz sauce is more like it.  Everybody knows that cheese and chicken are perfect food partners.  Like bacon and butterscotch, pancakes and ketchup, chocolate and orange juice.  If you haven't tried them you don't know what you're missing. He tried scraping the sauce off to no avail.  He gave up after a couple of bites.    This delightful experience of gastronomic disappointment and disgust cost a whopping $150 when it was all said and done.  Overpriced.  Miserable food. Nice environment.  I can't stress enough the wretchedness of the food.    The meal was fleeting, but the indigestion stayed with me all night.",

If you don't ask there is a chance you will get stuck in the back of the restaurant with a less desirable view of the carnival bar and the entrance to the Linq hotel. If you want to have a romantic dinner and sit together, ask to sit in a booth. This is the high end restaurant in Harrahs you will get a very mixed clientele.  You will observe jeans and  short sleeve shirts with their Coors Light from the casino to older couples elegantly dressed. The service is good, wait staff is very attentive.  Food is what you expect from Ruth Chris. Steak is great !! Creamed spinach and cheesecake dessert, great, potatoes au gratin under cooked.",

My family visited your restaurant for a birthday dinner and after one bite of a lamp chop he began choking and standing up to beg for help! His mother yelled for someone to please help us and call 911 while his brother attempted to help but he couldnt dislodge the meat. NOT ONE EMPLOYEE came to help administer the Heimlich maneuver and he was choking for over a minute! Thank God a Hero and good samaritan sitting at the table behind us came to his rescue and  after using Heimlich multiple times the food was projected out! I even gave him an EPI pen shot to be sure he was saved. We had informed our server of his seafood allergy so I hope to god this was not the reason he choked and All that matters is he is alive - (no thanks to the employees at Ruth Chris!) I don't care if its a legal requirement or not, there should always be someone on duty working INSIDE the restaurant who could have helped! Not to mention they didn't even apologize  that the birthday was ruined but they didn't even ask if he was OK when the paramedics arrived! I expected more from a worldwide restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip!",

Restaurant had lighting that was dim but attractive, set a great mood for the evening.   Staff was very polite and professional, we were greeted by a server and his assistant - I just want to begin by saying our server was shown up his assistant. My party was not given bad service but all the service we received was from the assistant.   Paying 20% on a $480 bill is roughly $100. I need my waiter/server to earn that kind of money.  In the future I hope wait staff, like Johnny, are more attentive and concerned with paying customers.   Thank you",

The table was sprinkled with rose petals, and we were promptly greeted by the manager DJ. The only complaint is that we ordered a medium-rare Tomahawk steak. We received it cooked as Medium, if the steak was any less quality it would have been ruined. Luckily it was still somewhat tender and full of flavor.",

We had a very early reservation and avoided the crowd. The service was exceptional from seating to food selection.  We had the Chopped Salad to start then followed with a New York Steak and Filet Mignon. The  Chopped salad was one of the better salads that I have had in a long time. Crisp, Fresh and flavorful.  The Steaks were cooked to the right temperature however they could have been better. We have been to Ruth's Chris all over the country and are familiar with the tastes of the steak dishes. These were slightly off and not soft. I don't think that we got the best cuts that evening. I want to state that the steaks were NOT bad however they weren't to the caliber of the Ruth's Chris steaks that we were accustomed to eating.",

My ribeye is always a perfect medium rare with untouched flavor. I recommend the au graton potatoes they are a must have. The red wine recommended by Ron \"prisoner\" red wine was very good and reasonably priced for the quality. A must try while in Vegas.

    "text": "I have been to two other Ruth's Chris restaurants and know the caliber in which they can perform. With that being said, this was a terrible experience. To be fair let me begin by saying my waiter was very friendly and professional (he is what earned this restaurant a two stars from me). I ordered a medium well petite filet. It was delivered well done so I sent it back requesting a new steak. My second steak was not the same quality of cut as the first and it was well done as well. On the third attempt the management told me they would bring it to me under done and allow their 500 degree plate to cook it through more completely. It arrived medium rare. The rest of my party was almost done eating and I now had to cut my steak into smaller pieces and finish cooking it myself by searing each piece on my plate. I was annoyed that I was paying almost $50 for a steak and it couldn't be prepared properly. As an apology they offered me a free $11 dessert but made me pay for the steak that I couldn't finish because the plate became too cold to continue cooking my steak on. Any subsequent trips to Vegas I will most certainly be choosing other steak houses.",

    "text": "I was very much looking forward to a nice dinner out with my husband, and Ruth's Chris seemed to be a good choice given all of the hype I'd heard about it from friends who had visited other locations.  When we were seated, our server poured our waters and managed to get some in the glass as the ice chunks splashed puddles onto our tablecloth.  Our server was nice enough, but not extremely attentive overall.  I ordered a bottle of wine, and 10 minutes later was presented a different bottle of wine. I decided to keep that bottle because I have enjoyed it before and I didn't want to wait for another bottle.  Once our glasses were poured, it was another 20-ish minutes before the server came to check on us again- I ended up pouring my own wine because I didn't want to wait any longer.  My husband (Vegetarian) had the terrific option (sarcasm meter going off) of choosing any 3 sides. Come on RC, a $50/plate restaurant can't keep some pasta noodles in the pantry and throw together a nice veggie and pasta dish? I understand we were at a steak house, but it would have been nice to provide an option other than a bunch of sides disguised as an entree.  My \"medium\" steak came out well done, and the wrong veggies were delivered with my husband's 'entree'.  Fortunately they fixed the error quickly, but given the series of errors, it was beginning to get ridiculous.  Eventually the manager walked by who was very kind and pleasant to speak with.  He seemed genuinely concerned about our satisfaction and apologized for the many errors we endured.  As we waited for our check, our server brought over a piece of chocolate cake with \"Thank you\" written in chocolate, as an apology from the manager.  Now this cake, was probably one of the most amazing desserts I have ever eaten.  Very rich, very decadent, and enough for two of us to easily share- the cake, was the stuff dreams are made of!  I wanted to come back to the restaurant later that evening just to get another piece of that cake (I didn't do it- but the thought genuinely crossed my mind!).  That gesture of good will has changed my mind from a \"will never return\" to a \"we might give RC a second chance after all.\"",

I think the bottom line is I like my steaks grilled, not broiled.  The sides (creamed spinach and mashed potatoes) were no better than what I make at home.    As for the atmosphere, it's a huge room and we had a nice view of the Strip.  The lighting was a bit too dim.  Nice staff.  We ordered wine and they brought us a 2006, not the 2010 we'd ordered.  Looked at the wine list again and ordered another bottle which they didn't have.  This restaurant had only been opened 3 or 4 weeks, and the wine list didn't reflect what they had in their cellar.  I wouldn't go to any Ruth's Chris again, it's not bad, it's just not the style of cooking that I prefer.",

    "text": "I love Ruth's Chris.  This location is the fifth one we've visited.  So we were surprised at the bumpiness of the service when we were there on Saturday.    Arrived with no reservations and grabbed a table in the bar area to eat.  That usually works well in the other Ruth's Chris, plus it's a good spot to people-watch.  Our waiter was friendly and settled us in with menus.  We ordered sparklling water and a glass of red wine.............and waited.  After about three apologies for the slowness in the wine arriving it came - mid-way through the salads.  Hmmm.  Dinner arrived, and as always, the steaks were a shining spot of happiness.  Perfectly cooked, sizzling plates, tender, yummy.  Blissfull.  Oh yes, the Cesar salad and potatoes were also perfect.  We never saw our waiter again.  Ever.  My wine was way long gone, something that would NEVER have happened at the other locations.  He didn't come back to check if everything was ok, if we wanted to order dessert.  Nada.  We had just been abandoned.  The GM was very kind and apologetic, but by then, we just wanted a check and to head out.  And then it took another 15 minutes to get the check.  So why the four stars?  Because Ruth's Chris is a fabulous place to eat.  The food is exceptional and worth the cost for a special occasion or if you just want a good chunk of perfect cow.  As soon as they work the bumps out from being in a new location, it will be killer.  But seriously, maybe wait a few weeks to let that all happen.",

In the reservation on OpenTable, I requested a booth with a view and the request was met spectacularly! Our server seemed rushed (and was therefore a bit curt) at the beginning but after drinks were ordered (and perhaps some of his other tables left or something) he seemed to relax and was more polite.  My boyfriend had the T-bone and I had the sea bass special; we had lyonnaise potatoes and creamed spinach as our sides.  It was all delicious and came out hot.  My boyfriend's steak was cooked medium well rather than medium but we didn't make a fuss because with both the filet and the strip to consider T-bones can be challenging (Although for the price it should be perfect).  For our anniversary, they brought us a complimentary piece of decadent chocolate fudge cake that was more than enough to share.  We had a groupon and also used our total rewards card because you get reduced prices and points if you use that.  Due to the groupon, and 18% gratuity is added before you pay.  Overall it was a lovely dinner with good food.  If not for the few minor complaints, it would be 5 stars.",

    "text": "This new Ruth's Chris is amazing and beautiful.  They did a great job.  Why they ever put their old restaurants in such horrible places with no business before beats me.  The new restaurant is hug and you take an elevator to get there, fancy huh.  There are  plenty of tables right next to the window, and even if you are not sitting directly by a window there are great views from all spots in the restaurant.    Since this place is so new the staff were EXTREMELY friendly so that people would say nice things.  Good job because it worked.  They brought the coolest light-up comment card holder to the table at the beginning.  The waiter knows the name of the host and calls you by your last name, which a lot of nice places do on the strip; very nice touch.    As for the food, I had the filet which was amazing, you cannot go wrong with this choice.  It is a very generous size filet also, you will not go hungry with some small, tiny over priced steak, you get what you pay for here and its amazing.  I also had the lobster bisque which was alright, but there are plenty of great appetizers to choose from here.  I will upload some pictures later.  Also if your going to get desert get the cheesecake, it will blow any you have had before out of the water!  After coming back from the Ruth's Chris in Hawaii and knowing that they had two shabby restaurants before I was hesitant to make a reservation here, but I will definitely be back now after seeing such a great transformation.  Also I would like to thank Donald Bishop their General Manager for doing such a great job.",

We ordered crab cakes for an appetizer and they were adequate.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad.  Very small for the price paid.  The real disappointment for me was the main dish.  I ordered the 11 oz filet cooked medium.  It was WAY overcooked.  It was gray all the way through, no pink whatsoever.  It also seemed like it lacked any seasoning at all.  For the first time ever in a steakhouse of that caliber (or price), I had to use salt and pepper to give my filet taste.  The kicker was the $11 mashed potatoes we bought to share.  I assumed they were family style, but it was about 2-3 spoonfuls of potatoes each, and they were also very average.  The final bill was over $200 and I honestly felt the Outback next door would have been better.  Maybe we were just there too early or caught the cook on an off night, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend going.",

I too did a web search and found the pricing on the web is way cheaper then what one gets from the menu, by about 15% cheaper.  My daughter and son in law brought us to this place for our birthday steak and to be honest I was not impressed and the cost was \"Astronomical.\"  My rib eye was not what I order-medium rare-it came out almost burnt rare.  I can do better then these guys but the sides were just okay because of the cost.  Our Asparagus cost an arm and a leg for maybe 15 pieces and for what we paid we could have bought about 5 pounds of this veggy at the supermarket.  Same for the broccoli.  Will we be back I don't think so because there are way better steak houses in town that aren't charging you a mortgage for food.  Decor is very nice though and we did not get window seating or ocean views, LOL.   Oh, entry is by elevator only so gotta find the elevator doors in Harrah's cause directional signage sucks and is non-existing.",

    "text": "I want to start by saying that I usually love Ruth's Chris... I had never had a bad meal there until Friday.  The first bottle of wine I ordered they came back 10 minutes later to inform me that they didn't have it but I could purchase a more expensive bottle of wine.  Understandable, but a good waiter should be aware of what the restaurant has in stock.  I ordered the petite filet with shrimp.  The shrimp were very good, but the meat, while cooked to medium, was tough, chewy, and seemed to be a cheap cut of meat.  This is the meal I usually order and it is usually so tender, you can cut the meat with a fork.  My sisters crab cakes were mushy and the potatoes au gratin were not cooked all the way.  No mention was made prior to taking my plate on whether the meal was \"good\".   It was only after they handed me the check that he asked if it was ok as they saw that I had barely eaten any of my meal.    To top it off, the had almost an entirely empty restaurant and they placed a family with a 3-4 year old child at the table directly next to us and they had their \"Happy and you know it\" music playing during the entire meal.  No one spends almost $400 on dinner and wants to listen to that.  Some forethought should have been made to place a family with a small child at a table a few tables away.  There was plenty of room.  The waiter seemed as though we were a bother to him from the time we sat down until he received the check.  He checked on our table maybe 3 times during the meal and one of those times was to drop the check.  I will not return to the Las Vegas Ruth's Chris again.  Poor service and even worse food.",

    "text": "The worst service ever! For what you pay to eat here, you should expect nothing less than stellar service, however what you get is equivalent to the service you would receive at a fast food restaurant. We brought our nephew here for his 21st birthday, had a party of 14, and were serviced by two waiters. Even with two waiters, the wait time for food or drinks was outrageous. Our waiter never even bothered to check on us once food was brought out. I am giving a 2 star review, only because of the extremely nice man who brought the bread and brought us coffee after our meal. He was very polite and efficient. Our two waiters, apparently didn't have the time needed to ensure their customers were having an enjoyable meal, or full drink glasses. Save your time and money, and eat elsewhere in Vegas. There are far too many great restaurants to waste your money on a subpar steak at Ruth's Chris.",

I give all components of this review 5 stars: Atmosphere, Location, Service, Presentation, and Product! I visit Ruth's Chris when I visit a city, and  now I have one locally, as well. I'm never disappointed by a visit to any location.  I'll start my review by delineating all components.  Atmosphere: located in the Harrah's casino second floor via elevator access only. As you step off the elevator, you're immediately greeted by the hostess station and a divine view of Las Vegas Blvd. If your visit is st night, as mine was, you have access to the beautiful glittering lights along the Blvd. My table was located to allow a perfect view of Caesar's Palace. It was stunning.  Location: centrally located on LVBlvd, in a very fun part of the strip. Lots of casinos and activities are in this area.  Service: exceptional- everything you expect and then some.  Presentation: the meal looks as if it's art on a photo shoot. No detail is spared.  Product: the food was amazing. Packed with flavor, hot, seasoned, sauteed and sauced to perfection. Moist and tender where need be, crisp with a crunch as described, melt in your mouth goodness.   All 5 areas made this dining experience a clear 5 star rating. I love a brand that delivers in all areas.",

Our server was so knowledgeable on all items on the menu and wine. The food was simply yummerz as you can see by the photos. Hands down the most delicious food just melted in your mouth. And to end our dinner with a lovely surprise with the cutest happy anniversary plate. Perfect dinner before our show.

It was my birthday so they placed little happy birthday confetti on the table to so everyone who approached knew we were celebrating something.    Service was impeccable, from the hostess to the server.  Everyone did a great job.  It probably helped that it wasn't that busy, but we'll take it regardless.  Food was excellent. I'm not a steak person so I opted for the stuffed chicken.  My dinner partner had the T-Bone steak though and said it was great.    For my birthday, they delivered a little cheesecake which was just the right size for a nice dessert.    Note: If your Diamond level with Total Rewards (which we are thanks to the matching Tier levels from other casino's), you get a $100 dinner celebration which we were able to apply to this meal.  Still expect to pay about $75 per person and remember to tip based on the full price and not the remaining balance.",

    "text": "Geez, where do I start. This place could be so much more successful with just a little attention to detail. It is located on the second floor of Harrah's which allows for a nice view of the strip - providing you get a table close enough to the windows. This was the first Ruth's Chris that I have been to and had high hopes for such a reputable name.   There was a group of 11 of us and after all was said and done we spent a little over 3 hours and $1,800 (not including tip). The dress code posted at the hostess stand does not seem to be enforced. There were people in a wide range of attire, most not suitable for a high end steakhouse but I digress - after all, it is Vegas. There were kids screaming, yelling and running around most of our visit.  Again, not ideal for this type of environment.   The wait staff was attentive but could have improved. Our waiter took our order but due to a technical \"glitch\" the system lost the order and he had to retake everyone's order (quite a while after placing the initial order). The cocktails were good but overpriced for the size. The food was good, one of the best steaks I've had in a while. I chose the 11 oz filet with Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese and cheesecake. They serve the steaks on a 500 degree plate and repeatedly inform you of how hot the plates are.  The lobster in the mac and cheese was a bit chewy but still tasty. The Caesar salad and cheesecake were both very good.   Shortly after 10pm they turned all the lights on, essentially hinting to those still there that it's time to pack up and get out. Not very professional in my opinion. Overall it was a good meal but I came in expecting more out of such a well recognized name.  With the wide range of choices in Vegas I would definitely look at other options in the future.",

The entrance is trashy as coming from downstairs of a dirty casino, the patrons from that very casino come upstairs and use the bathrooms, I felt like \"midnight with working girls in the bathrooms\", the guests have wife-beater shirts on with basketball shorts, a four top of very loud and obnoxious people was escorted out after arguing and yelling curse words, the service was poor by best and the steak after third time still not cooked correctly. Menus are so old and worn, I took couple of pictures, again, how can you present something like this in this type of establishment is beyond me. The manager was the biggest joke, as to him crediting the bill was his solution and he had no intention of listening what is really wrong and how he can improve his restaurant/team by our feedback. It seemed he disliked being there as much as we did.  Needless to say I am surprised that corporate has their name on this very particular site as it is an embarrassment to Ruth's Chris name/legacy.",

The filet mignon is melt in your mouth, the service is very good and same with the ambiance in Las Vegas Nevada and even nicer in South Barrington IL. The private booth in South Barrington is the only way to go if you are taking your significant other.  The best option is the 3 course special with your choice of a salad or soup, one side, entree and dessert. I chose the 11 ounce filet and split it with my friend. The raspberry cosmo and the lemon martini with coconut is excellent!   Be prepared to spend a lot of money but it is well worth it!!",

And we weren't dressed up (because we had something come up that put us in a time crunch to go back to the hotel to get dressed up before the time of our reservation) -- so we went casual and boy, were we disappointed.  Apparently, if you aren't dressed up, you deserve mediocre service. We were given looks from servers and our order wasn't taken until about 26 minutes after being seated (we were ready to leave after 30).  Food was mediocre.  Want a better steak?  Go to Delmonicos or Flemings. What made it taste worse was the level of ignorance that came with the lack of customer service.  Once our food came out, we weren't checked on once by any of the servers.  We definitely won't be back. Thanks for being a bunch of jerks!",

I did not complain because we were walk ins I figured the other tables had reservations.  We ate and left, and still there were many tables available with the beautiful view.  I felt like just plain old water, but the waiter told me they had tap water and offered bottle.  I wish he had told me it was $8 for a bottle of water!  My husband ordered a steak. It was delicious and tender.  I ordered the salmon which was a little overcooked.  The sides were all pretty good. For the price of the meal, I expected everything to be top notch: service and food.  The service was ok.  Most of the food was good, but after spending close to $300 I'd go elsewhere next time because it's not worth it.",

I flew 15,000 kilometres to Vegas for SEMA week and was recommended by friends to try this steakhouse. Among the different steaks I've had that week in different, the Cowboy Rib-Eye was hands-down the best! The sizzling steak butter was the best match to the flavourful meat. The lobster bisque was exceptional and so was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Real classic dishes and served perfectly!   But for me the most memorable experience was with my server Joe Veniegas! He was alert, hospitable, honest and charming. I've observed him on the other tables and you could witness the exceptional service provided by Joe. I could not ask for more. If you're ever in Vegas for Ruths Chris, ask for the guy! All my friends will from now on.   Not only will I return, I will tell all my friends about it :)",

Didn't have a clue how to serve wine and was constantly interrupting conversation.   Food was okay at best. Nothing special. The constant announcements about the temp of the oven did nothing to help the taste.   I am being generous with 2 stars. This restaurant isn't even close to Morton's or so many other steakhouses. In Las Vegas I'm surprised it's survived with the competition.   I'll take a pass on ever wasting my time here again. Further it cements my feeling that Ruths Chris is an over rated chain. It's too easy to do better",

Let me just jump right into it, the service was horrible and I hate to say that but it was just really god-awful... our server never checked up on us and constantly forgot to put in the things we ordered; the only good part about the service was the nice lady who gave us our bread, she was more attentive than our own server. For dinner, we ordered the Tomahawk for the table as a shareable dish due to its size. It comes out and our waitress asked if we would like for her to cut it up so we oblige, thinking that she knows what she's doing... boy, were we wrong. She gave each of us 2 pieces, a large block-like chunk and then a small sliver of fat for each of us, coming out to 6 pieces total. She completely butchered the steak! The way it was suppose to be served was in thin slices so each of us could grab as we pleased. When we called back to let the manager know, he said she should have never touched the steak and that they are specifically told not to do this. He was nice enough to offer us a recovery dinner so we will be back. We've been to Ruth Chris before, so we know this isn't how a typical experience goes but I figured I'd write about it anyways.",

The steak came on a 550 degree plate and you could not eat the steak because it was too hot.  My steak came almost raw.  My waiter said that he could have it cooked more.  My experience has been that once you cut into a steak and then reheat it it becomes tough.  He never offered a replacement.  My steak has always been cooked and then let to rest. That is how every steak I have eaten has been prepared and they turn out excellent.  I cook my own steak maybe a dozen times a year and I can pretty much nail the inner temperature.  This was supposed to be a professional chef that should know how to cook steak. I ate with a friend and my cost was $100. Not everyone that goes to Vegas has a lot of money.

    "text": "One of the pit  bosses at the Mirage recommended Chris's steakhouse as a place to grab a sandwich during happy hour. Since happy hour is only an hour and a half, we tried several times And kept missing it (darn gambling getting in the way :-).   We finally made it during the first week of May, 2014, took the elevator to the second floor in Harrah's, and walked into a different world. The hostesses and waitstaff are all dressed as you would expect workers to be attired at fine steakhouse. We immediately felt out of place in our casual attire, but as we looked around the bar area we noticed other people were dressed the same way. If men are wearing a hat when they walk into the restaurant, they will be asked to remove it.  There were only a few selections on the happy hour menu, and the seating for happy hour was only in the bar area, so if there are no seats available, you are asked to wait on a comfortable, long couch. We ordered the steak sandwich for $7 and it was mouth watering! Lean, tender steak pieces on a fresh baked roll with fries - excellent! The specials are not widely advertised, and it takes a little digging to find out about it, but this is the website that has the simple menu:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruthschris.com%2Fbar%2Fhappy-hour%2F&s=33ccf2b1911779a6d58ec2ffc4f8b85b1d610bc5458326434497b0c8e8bc4051\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ruthschris.com/bar/happy...</a>  Despite having the 'cheap meal', at an obviously fine steakhouse, we were treated with respect and payed as much attention to as all the other high paying customers.   Definitely at the top of the list for our next visit :-)",

    "text": "I love steaks. I love Ruth's Chris. I took my entire team here for a dinner and they were incredibly flexible with me when it came to my reservation. I forgot to call ahead and they managed to squeeze me in within 2 hours of me calling for a group of 7.  What I did like was the level of service that we got, that you normally expect from a Ruth's Chris steakhouse and the overall quality of the steaks and sides. We got plenty of appetizers, including the calamari and seared ahi tuna which were both delicious and then all of us ended up ordering different steaks and I got myself a Filet Mignon. It came out a bit too burnt on the outside and arguably medium-well rather than the medium I had ordered. My normal experience at steakhouses is that they usually undercook from what you order so if you order a steak medium rare it comes out almsot rare and when you order a steak well, it comes out medium well. This way, they never overcook the meat or have to give you a new steak if you're unhappy with the grill. Normally, I would say that I was just being picky, but one of my colleagues ended up actually sending his steak back because he too ordered a medium steak and it ended up coming out medium-well.  The desserts were fantastic and delicious and overall, the meal was very filling and satisfying. No matter that it cost me about $100 a head, we enjoyed ourselves. However, I would like to point out to the restaurant's management that they should consider slightly undercooking, not overcooking their steaks. And that they should re-train some of their waitstaff as our waiter constantly tried upselling us on sparking mineral water throughout the meal. Keep in mind that we had already ordered two bottles and some cocktails.  Also, one of the waitresses that came by ended up pouring a half glass of still water into a glass of sparkling water without asking before pouring. This also may require some retraining of the staff as it wouldn't be a problem if they didn't charge extra for sparking mineral water. Overall, my experience was okay but this location definitely needs work when compared to the Ruth's Chris of San Diego and Del Mar.",

Came into this location on Dec 12 Saturday night at 10:02 pm. We were told by the hostess we couldn't sit on the main dining room. To seat our selves in the lounge. After sitting for about 7 minutes without anyone acknowledging us a server came by and told us that section was closed. Went to the lounge tables  next to the bar where we waited another 7 minutes or so to be given menus. Finally ordered. We got our first course a soup with still no water, no bread and no utensils (no wine either ) on the table. At that point called the manager over and asked if this was a Ruth Chris. The manager ended up waiting on us for the rest of the evening. The food was lame at best. Service non existant  (never saw the waitress again until the check ) Also the table next to us was in the same predicament they ended up wrapping most of their meals and leaving after asking for service several times. I felt I was at Dennys with a different name! !! PS.. I go to RC Coral Gables,  Miami ALL the time at lunch, Happy Hour, dinner, weekdays, weekends no matter how busy they are 20 people would acknowledge you and ask how can they assist you! !!! Never will go to this location again! !!",

    "text": "Ruth's Chris Steak House is visually fantastic.  The ambiance is relaxing, yet the decor adds a bit of a sophisticated touch. The windows that line the side of the restaurant provide a great view, especially in the evening.  With that said, when you sit down in this steak house, your expectations are already high.  We had an extremely large group of people.  Roughly 50+ people were there who are a part of our Sales Organization.  With this in mind, we had a limited menu which was no problem at all.  They did a great job of taking care of each person.  They had about 6 or 7 waiters who took care of us.  I think the longest my wine glass went empty was for 5 minutes...impressive when you think about how many people we rolled in with.   Soooo why the 2 star rating? Because the steak I ordered was horrible.  I know I could be a touch more gracious here, but no joke....it was not good.  The cut was fine, it was thick, tender, it looked like heaven.  However....this is the part that gets me.  Butter.  Yes I just said....Butter.  My steak was floating in a plate of....Butter.  Is it just me? Perhaps this is some new fancy thing that's beyond my palate, but DO NOT EVER soak my steak in melted butter.  What I didn't care for was that the buttery taste took over the whole steak.  As I said previously, expectations were already set when I first walked in.  I was expecting a stellar steak, which didn't happen this time.  Also, there wasn't any type of indication that it was going to be prepared that way, if so...I would've opted for one of the other selections we had to choose from.  The sides were good, bread....mashed taters and of course wine were all spot on.  I could probably be a little more forgiving, but for me ambiance and decor don't get the lion share of the ratings.  I would eat dinner in a box on the street and give it 5 stars if the food was spectacular, probably note in the review that the box was a little small......but none the less, I would still drop 5 stars if it was fantastic.",

We were told to get reservations, but it wasn't super busy.  Service was no where near what I expected. I figure if I am having a 200.00 dinner I should NEVER have to ask for a drink refill but we had to flag him down. We were trying to order and felt rushed plus the waiter was adamant we could share the sides. Which I thought was odd but we order the filet and I ordered the 20 oz lobster. (He explained the small size was very tiny)  The steak was good but it wasn't as good as expected. (Bob 's in Irving Texas beat the heck out of this piece of meat.) We shared a potato( I don't k now why) We both asked for one but he was pretty sure we wanted to share...lol We also shared the salad..which was prob a good idea it was not that great we left most of it on our plates. The lobster was VERY chewy and stringy ..of the 20 oz ..about 25% was not edible to me. Hate to say it but I've had better at Red Lobster. We never got the bread replenished. Once we were served he flat forgot about us. Needless to say...You should only order beef and do not try anything else...beef is obviously their specialty and it is nothing to write home about.",

Things took awhile to get going, but once my server arrived, things went well.  I enjoyed the chowder, a fillet and decided to try something new. I ordered a side of onion rings.

    "text": "BEWARE!!!!!!!My husband and I  made dinner reservations at this particular Ruth's Chris to enjoy the Thanksgiving Prix Fixe Menu. Our first issue was the price, we have a tradition of traveling Thanksgiving week and we have dined at Ruth's Chris in various states and cities over the years. Over time the holiday meal price has changed varying from $36.95 to $39.95. However, never in our 6 years of this tradition have we ever paid $66 for our Thanksgiving Prix Fixe Dinner. Our server stated the charge was due to the fact this particular location is inside of the Harrah's Casino. It was Thanksgiving night and our anniversary so my wife and I went ahead ordered the meal since she really wanted Turkey. Second issue is when the food arrived, I immediately noticed that the meal looked vastly different to all the others we have had in the past. First the stuffing did not have sausage in it, in fact, it appeared to be plain toasted French bread slathered in cheap canned gravy. I tried to make the best of this $66 meal however, once I tried to put my fork into the stuffing, I discovered a rather large chunk of just plain dry bread. We immediately alerted our server who promptly apologized and offered to replace the meal. I declined with tears in my eyes stating its ok I am no longer hungry. At this point, I pretty much felt like dinner was ruined. When I told the server I cant believe Ruth's Chris would serve something like this and how the Thanksgiving meal has never been this bad at any of the other locations. Our server admitted the Thanksgiving meal had been prepared downstairs by the Harrah's cooks who work in their buffet kitchen and then brought upstairs to Ruth's. I was so upset to know that we had been duped into believing we were eating Ruth's quality dinner (especially for the price) only to find that it was the same meal being served in the Buffet. Of course I confirmed that the stuffing and mashed potatoes were all in fact the exact same. Our server was able to remove my meal from the bill however, seeing as how my husband ate his so we still had to pay $66, in my mind we still paid a hefty price to have cafeteria style dinner for one. My concern is if Ruth's allows for franchise purchasing they need to add specific guidelines to ensure the quality of the food being served under their namesake.",

    "text": "We use to love this restaurant chain. We travel a lot and always have at least had one dinner, in the city we are in if they have one. We go to Vegas twice a year and were surprised last year when we went. This one is inside Harrah's, you take an elevator up and when the doors open it is really nice, clean and impressive. The steaks are fantastic as everything else is too, even the bread is good to eat while waiting for your meal.  It was our anniversary we were celebrating so we decided on a really good meal, you will easily spend over a hundred dollars for two to have dinner. All sides are separate but generous enough for you to share. There is a good view of Caesar's Palace and the lights of the strip. It was a good evening till the check arrived. I tried to use two $25.00 gift cards from \"Ruth Chris\". The waiter said he took off $25.00 but the second card had no money on it which was kind of embarrassing for me. I think they believed since we were tourists we would just throw the card away. When we got home I made some calls and found out the card was used on the date we ate there and the location. I called the restaurant and explained what had happened and what I had discovered. A few days later the assistant manager called and got my e-mail address to conclude what he found. He confirmed the card was cashed in at his restaurant but no credit given to me. He agreed to give us our $25.00 that was stolen and $10.00 for our trouble and left it at that. This was no mistake, the waiter stole $25.00 from us, He ran the card took the money and told us it was no good. I believe they should have given us the entire dinner for free once they discovered they had a thief. I sent my concerns to Ruth Chris corporate and the Casino's corporate only to get blown off. Who would have thought a classy place like this would be running scams on tourists, very disappointed!",

The evening started a little slow as our waiter was busy with the manager over something. Once we did get things started (about a ten+ minute wait even after we asked for the waiter) service was excellent. The mozzarella and tomato salad is large enough to split, which my wife and I did. I tried the bone in NY steak rather than my usual rib eye and was not disappointed. It was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My wife ordered the stuffed chicken breast and would not do that again. She said it was all cheese. She wished she had just ordered a petite filet which she has enjoyed in the past. One disappointment was that when they revamped their menu about a year ago they removed Lyonnaise potatoes which I love. Half the reason for choosing between steak restaurants in Las Vegas is the side dishes since they all have great steaks. I expressed my disappointment to the manager when he came by to ask how everything was and he told me that if I informed them I wanted Lyonnaise potatoes when I make my next reservation, they will have them available for me. That is great customer service and I will take them up on their offer. Our out of town visitors had the filet and the shrimp entree and both were pleased. The French fries were good but not Lyonnaise potatoes and the creamed spinach was excellent. I can't comment on dessert as we've never had room for it on any of our visits but they do look good. The steaks and the service coupled with The Strip view still make this is my favorite Ruth's Chris location.",

For the price, I should expect to receive lean cuts of lamb but these were, by far, the fattiest chops I've ever had. The service was great, although our waiter was not as friendly as usual. I will still frequent Ruth's Chris but not this location.",

She had a friendly smile and brought us some water.  The Ruth Chris in San diego was much better.  Do yourself a favor and pass this place on by.

Happy hour is from 5 to 6 excluding weekends. The prime burger is just that, prime all the way served with yummy fries for $12. Amazing. I had the steak sandwich which consists of garlic roll and plenty of filet pieces served with lettuce, tomato and onion accompanied by bernaise sauce for $12. Beer is $5 and they have a selection of wine discounted. You can also order off main menu in the comfy bar.   Service from Ron and Camacho is over the top.  Located in Harrah's on the strip. If you haven't experienced Ruth's Chris steak you haven't had the best steak in the world. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

On our second visit, I asked the bartender to make a Mint Julep, and he said it would be much better if his comrade made it for me. I really appreciate that kind of honestly, and he was right. It was delicious! He asked a few questions about my whiskey preferences, which shows how much they care about their craft.  The food here is always on-point.

Maybe not for others though, they tend to be on the mushy side and very garlicky.   For the dinner wine we had the Robert Mondavi cabernet. Ordered the rib eye and the bone in rib eye, both rare. Both delectable in their own individual ways. For me I personally prefer the rib eye. Our bone in rib eye was over cooked to medium rare. The rib eye for some reason tastes more tender. I have had both many times at other Ruth Chris locations and had the same result. For the sides we got the lobster mac and cheese and the cream spinach. I always order the creamed spinach, it is my favorite side. The lobster mac and cheese was a first for me. I would not order it again. The green peppers were overpowering and the Mac and cheese was not that tasty unfortunately.   For dessert we ordered the berries and sweet cream sauce and the cheesecake. Both my favorite for different reasons. The cream sauce is to die for. So delicious. The cheesecake is very rich and cheesy. The only thing I would say is that ordering the two together is not recommended since the sweet cream sauce is so sweet takes away from cheesecake.",

I feel like they allowed us to be louder than the typical quiet atmosphere of a Ruth Chris, which I appreciated because, hey, it's Vegas!  I ordered a filet and we ordered a bunch of sides so I was able to try the creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes, and mashed potatoes. All the sides were delicious, especially the spinach! The filet was juicy and tender. I've been to Ruth Chris in Cancun and Irvine and this Ruth Chris meets the same standard of deliciousness as the others.  I was disappointed with their deserts though! I got the cheesecake and the layer on top was more bitter than sweet (weird for cheesecake) and the graham cracker tasted stale. Would not recommend cheesecake here.  If you're in Vegas and want to celebrate a special event, Ruth Chris is always a dependable good place to eat.",

    "text": "By far the best steak house that's ever come to light.  Especially with the long awaited return to Las Vegas inside of Harrah's Casino.  My first experience with Ruth Chris was in Los Angeles on a birthday weekend three years ago.  I thought I just happen to find a really nice steak house, but everywhere else I have ever compared it to have come nothing but too short.  The location here in Las Vegas delivered exactly the same consistency I remembered!  I always order the three course meal for $69, which includes an 8oz filet, a side dish, house salad or lobster bisque, and of course a dessert of pure chocolate that takes you into a fantasy island.  I've had other meals and all are seasoned with the most flavorful seasonings a man can only dream of.  If it wasn't for the price, I'd probably be at Ruth Chris every single day.  Well worth the prices though.  The real review aside from the other items on there menu is for the steaks.  They must slow cook them for two days, because I can't figure out how they get that tender on the steak.  When it came to my table my plate was probably still 200 degrees it was that hot!  The savory taste of the melted butter on top warranted no additional seasoning required.  If you're looking for the best steak in the world and want an evening of romance and fun, look no further.  You'll die and wake up in steak heaven.  Bravo!!!",

Maybe 1.5 stars bc the steak was seasoned well. But overcooked. Asked for medium. Came out medium well.  Baked potato had everything on it even though I asked to have everything on the SIDE. And was over done.  Mashed Potatoes were super late. We were more than half way through our meal and asked for it twice b4 receiving it.   Dessert never came. Mind you we ordered the 3 course meal. Extra bread never came despite asking politely for some. Drinks were not refilled to save her life.   Asked for check twice and was never brought. She entertained her other guests and made us wait for eternity. Another waitress brought our mashed potatoes. And to top it off we never got an apology.   I'm not one to complain but this was too much. I hope it was isolated, but don't expect me to dine there ever again even if my diamond member friends invite me. Sorry, but worst service ever. Total rewards? I think not. More like no rewards. MLife for life.   Sad Jessica ruined what was to be a nice relaxing anniversary dinner.   To all Californians just go to Beverly Hills or San Francisco for your Ruth's Chris experience.",

The lobster dish was chosen by the fourth person, and while it tasted great according to him, the portion was conspicuously smaller.   The Steak Sandwich comes on a garlic French roll/baguette, and the steak is topped with bearnaise sauce. It also comes with a generous portion of fries. I asked for mine medium-rare, but I did think it was closer to rare as some of the pieces looked like they had just been seared and the inside looked purple. I still ate it, though. And it was delicious. Next time, though, I will probably go for medium or medium-well which should equate to medium-rare.  The pomegranate martini is also a nice treat!",

The day of scheduled visit someone from Harrahs leaves a voicemail the day before scheduled visit stating that if i don't call by 2 pm the next day, day of reservation i will be cancelled. She left no number so i called immediately if not sooner back to the number that showed up on my phone as who ever called didn't leave a specific to call them back at. When i called the displayed number Harrah's main switchboard operator answered. I explained i got a call about confirmimg the reservation but she seemed a little confused but looked up my name and said yes you have a reservation so you're all set. Done i thought. So we show up at 6:30 for a 6:45 reserviction. Ask my name and if i booked through open table. Told her my name and open table the res was made through.Can't find me anywhere. Asks for my phone number, found it and you've been cancelled cuz you never called. Wrong as i showed and played the message from them and my immediate if not sooner return call to the same number. Then i was asked if i talked to somebody and yes i did and she said i was all set. Obviously not. What's the point reserving online since one has to call them up after words a couple of days before on wishes to attend. You might as well call them days in advance and make a reservation. Never had to do this before with anybody. Sometimes a place may text you needing a confirmation respone Then i saw $80 per person Thanksgiving dinners and just from the sight they were nothing to write home about. Doubt i'll get to ever eat at one and really don't care at this point. Went down to Harrahs buffet and ate Turkey at half the price. Then at 9:30 pm i get an email written at 4:28 pm thanking me for cancelling my reservation which i didn't and then how they canceled it. What a cluster Fu**.",

It's depressing inside the casino, this environment should have been updated 20 years ago.    I loved Ruth's in Pittsburgh, Louisville, and several other locations, but this one is just not up to the expectations Ruth's advertises.  If you are looking for an elegant dinner experience there are 100's in Vegas, this is not one.    The first indication of an upcoming bad experience, well after entering Harrah's, is there is no enforcement of a dress code.  People had cut off jeans, crop top shirts and flip flops (without the bodies that should be wearing such revealing clothes, I'm talking 200 pound women where the shorts are vacuumed up locations best undescribed).  This wasn't unusual, it was the predominate outfit.  This isn't the pool, but it was the norm when we were there, Monday May 2, 2016.  Pretty good cocktail prices, around $15 for specialty drinks.  4 shrimp (1 order) cocktail, the best part of the meal $22, 11 oz (although it looked larger, more like 14 oz) filet for around $60. Sides were priced at market rate.  The Oscar topping was horrible, canned or old crab meat definitely ruined anything it was served on.   It reminded me of the \"cheese\" sauce you buy in 64 oz cans at Sams. It also, seemed like it accompanied almost everything.  The steaks were cooked to order, good but not spectacular.  I'd rate the experience and food quality as that you'd see in a chain, such as Texas Roadhouse, etc.  Not what you'd expect from \"fine\" dining, or prices in this category.  Server John was very attentive, helpful, and was busy but efficient.  Expect to pay around $100 each for a truly uninspiring dinner.  Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

From there we moved to lobster bisque (not so great) and Caesars salads.  The mains were 40 oz porterhouse, 11 oz filet, and a mixed grill.  All the steaks were prepared perfectly and the various sides were also well executed.  The service was so-so.  The waiter was pleasant, but there were little hiccups throughout the meal.  He did not provide app plates for the seafood tower, so we used our bread plates, which was not optimal.  He brought out our birthday girl's complimentary dessert, yet did not offer dessert menus to any of the rest of us.  There were also some extended times between visits.  Overall:  good place to celebrate a special occasion, and bring your wallet.",

    "text": "Ruth's Chris is our favorite steak house. The lobster bisque soup is so delicious. I look forward to the rich creamy taste every visit. The sweet potato casserole is UNBELIEVABLE!!! It is the perfect side item for any entree. The taste reminds me of a good grandma recipe. I enjoy saving mine to eat last.  It's could even be like a dessert.   If you are looking for a good wine.  I prefer the Meiomi. This is a beautiful Pinot Noir that has aromas of dark red fruits and fresh berries. The rich cherry flavor is complemented by notes of cedar, raspberry and strawberry. It goes well with beef dishes.   Ruth's Chris is a great place to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or just I nice date night. I have never had anything off the menu that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed.",

So I ordered the crab and corn chowder which was amazing. the waiter recommended I go with the regular Muscato over the peach Muscato which I was happy with. For my main meal I got the crabcakes. I enjoyed them they were there was definitely more crab then there breading. I didn't feel cheated as a lot of places barely give you any crap meat. Overall I would say this is the typical Ruth Chris experience except for the service. The waiter and his assistant went over and beyond to make sure me and my group had everything we needed. I happen to mention that I just graduated college and they made sure that my achievement was acknowledged. They put confetti on the table and they also bring me out a dessert Yes Att congratulations. I really appreciated that. I would definitely recommend Ruth Chris to anybody looking for a good meal Las Vegas.",

The asian sauce was good but the way they dumped it all over the calimari made it super mushy and gross. It would have been infinitely better had they had it on the side as a dipping sauce. Calamari needs a little crunch, not a nasty soggy slop.  The filet was awful. I requested it medium rare and it came out dry and tough. For $65 I expect my filet to be top quality and this tasted like something I could cook myself from the grocery store. It was so overdone that when I requested a new one they made it practically rare. With the 500 degree plate, I used it to cook the few pieces I ended up eating.   Mashed potatoes were ok, a little too salty but what do you expect when everything is drenched in butter.   I expected so much better for such a pricey and well-reviewed steak house. I totally regret this meal and I wish I would have gone down the strip to Mon Ami Gabi where the filet is cooked to perfection.",

The only comment/tip I have for the restaurant, is that I wish they would serve equal parts of the Veal Ravioli, (only 5 served) since my boyfriend and I ordered it as an appetizer and would have enjoyed equal portions (6). Other than that, the Filet I ordered was so rich, velvety and moist. Extremely delicious!",

    "text": "My family has been going to Ruth's Chris for over 20 years and sadly, the quality has gone downhill and does not live up to their prior standards.   We had a 9:30pm reservation and were running a few minutes late while waiting for a taxi  and politely called to let the staff know. They told us there was a 15 minute grace period but after that would not be able to \"guarantee seating us.\" We ran through the casino to make it by 9:45pm, to find a half empty restaurant. We couldn't believe that the hostess who answered the phone hadn't told us to relax and take our time coming in.  The dinner service was rushed, they brought out the main courses before we finished appetizers. Then around 10:50pm we ordered dessert. A few minutes later, the music in the restaurant turned off. A minute after that, staff started rushing around to start cleaning, completely ignoring the several still occupied tables around them and doing work that should be done once a restaurant is empty of clients.   Then a few minutes after that, our waiter came back and told us that all of the chefs and kitchen staff had already left for the night and locked the kitchen and that they did not have access and as such, could not serve us dessert. He apologized and said there was nothing he could do and that even the manager did not have a key to the dessert refrigerators.  We learned that the restaurant stops service at 11, but apparently the entire kitchen staff had rushed home early to the detriment of their clients and not asked the waiters if there were any additional orders. This was a Friday night in Las Vegas, mind you, and we were refused dessert service that we ordered at 10:50pm.   When we received our bill, we were very surprised to see it was for the full amount and no discount had been offered. The manager, whose name is apparently Kevin, never came to the table to apologize. Perhaps he left early with the kitchen staff.  We paid our bill and walked through the silent music-less ghost town of a restaurant and felt as if we were being kicked out of a cheap bar after last call.  We wrote an email to the corporate office, and did not receive a response. Thanks for the memories, Ruth's Chris, but I'll be going to different restaurants from now on that value their customers.",

    "text": "I did have a good steak, and this chain has always been a go-to if you have an expense account or are ready to drop a bundle. The $70 tasting menu was adequate. I did ask for bread and the response was, \"I can get bread for you.\" Really? You can? My hero! The problem is Las Vegas - the often weirdly friendly or edgy labor pool and the design and planning for imports to a city where less is never heard of, and more is more. When the dessert came, a spoon larger than any soup spoon I'd ever seen accompanied it. I mentioned it to the people I was chatting with as well as the bar server. \"Well, I've been here for three years and nobody has ever complained about the spoon.\" Okay, I expressed myself clearly to indicate that I was not pleased. To show how off-base the whole scene was, later the server/bar guy and a cohort returned with tiniest spoon in the house. Very funny - they thought!! I guess it was a spoon for cocktail sauce. I suggested 'coke'. Besides, who eats chocolate cake with a giant spoon? Bottom line: room is pleasant with big view of strip. With wine, which is way overpriced, expect to pay at the very least $125 pp with tax and tip, likely more if you are hungry.",

    "text": "What is the number one rule of any great steakhouse?  Get the temperature right!  Nothing can ruin a very expensive meal faster than an incorrectly cooked steak.  It just seems so demoralizing after waiting all day to get that juicy taste of Medium Rare Goodness to then bite into a worn leather tough steak.  BOTH of our medium rare steaks came out this way.  Given that we had a show to catch and didn't want to have to wait longer than we already had, we didn't ask them to correct it (which I am sure they would have).  We decided to come here because the GF used to love going to the old closed-down location in town.  The steak was always cooked perfectly with great flavor, the service was impeccable, and the experience wonderful.  This location missed on all counts.  I really did get the sense they were trying, but it just didn't work.  And we really wanted it to work.  The steak was very tough, it seemed maybe even more than just from the overcooking.  The service was both slow and rushed over the course of the same meal.  Forking over this much cash for a meal that was in no way enjoyable for either of us was just painful, especially when you are treating your love to a meal that is supposed to be special.  When we should have been celebrating our special occasion with joy, I found myself apologizing over and over again for surprising her with the new Ruth's Chris (she didn't know they had opened this location).  We are really hoping that they just weren't on their game, and that they will get back on to par with the levels of the old location.  But until we hear from multiple people that they have turned the corner and gotten everything running smoothly, sadly we won't be returning.  There are just too many other great steak houses in town to hope they have improved after this experience.",

The manager there, a large african amercian, sorry I don't know his name, when asked he said \"Bill Cosby\", was the most rudest incompetent manager I have ever seen!  We had a issue with the bill and when he came to our table he was rude, sloppy, and pretty much said \"if you don't like it, get out!\"  I was shocked!!  I called corporate and they said they have no control over them as they are a franchise.  He doesn't deserve to be a manager, he has no people skills and is as I said, very incompetent.  I am very disapointed with the powers that be there at that restaurant that they allow such a man to be a manager at their restaurant.  If he was like this with me I am sure he is with others, so hopefully they will see the truth about this man.",

We attended for our anniversary, looking to take a photo on Strip,, as well as enjoy a special evening. Hostess could not find reservation, even though we made it the evening before in person. Hostess was equally rude and non responsive to request for seating, as too busy talking to another employee.  First two wines we attempted to order, out of stock.  When we finally attempted to order, the waitress was non existent to take food order. When food did come, side dish forgotten.. Photographer was to show up pre dinner, was no show until after dinner, and had mechanical error, so photo not available to next day for return trip. Total debacle = Total Rewards at this location. Food and location does not warrant the poor service and cost of this location. Skip it.....",

Food was perfect, steaks cooked exactly the way we like them.  All 3 of us have different ways to have our steaks prepared.  To top it off, the executive Chef stopped by our table to see how dinner was....that was very cool and appreciated.  Desert was as good as the steaks.  There is not one thing I'd suggest to have made our meal and experience better.  :-)",

Our waitress asked how our dinners were, and we told her.  She commented that the ribeye was surprisingly below standard, compared to rest of their steaks.

Strange when you ride in a elevator with glass windows and a view of a wall. But once the doors open the entrance to the dinning room was nice some seats you can see parts of the strip. Service was slow at the beginning took awhile for us just to get bottle water. If you live in Vegas you know not to drink tap water. Started with a bottle of Acrobat medium  red $54.00 not bad. App was spicy lobster which was a lightly fried lobster tossed in  spicy  cream sauce served with a tangy cucumber salad. $17.00. It was just OK.  I had a house salad iceberg, baby arugula, grape tomatoes, garlic croutons, red onion  with balsamic. $8.50 I order there Halibut special they did not have Halibut but had substituted sea bass $40.00. The Sea Bass was cooked perfect light flaky. Fresh tomato on the bottom Sea bass topped with crab and lobster meat this was great. My friend order a cowboy rib-eye $53.00 rare with sauteed onions. It came medium rare the onions where over salted server addressed and fixed this in less then ten minutes. My other friend had harvest salad an petite fillet $40.00 it was cooked medium rare which is how she ordered it. We choose the sweet potato casserole pecan crust  this is like a dessert its good.  Potatoes Au gratin Idaho sliced potatoes with a three cheese sauce this was a much better side great flavors. Chef was nice to send out dessert bread pudding it was delicious.From beginning to end it was a good dinning experience and great prices. This is coming from someone who dines out a lot with friend and will pay for a great dining experience. This is one of the more affordable steakhouses on the strip. Also if you are traveling to Vegas or live here go get reward cards at all casino's they do help with cost.",

We did not wait for our drink orders to be taken; the waitress was right there to explain everything to us. Angie was great and repeatedly checked up on us to make sure that we were ok. The problem was the food. I ordered Lobster Bisque and it was just not as expected. Barely any small little bits of lobster in it at all and the flavor was not great. I had ordered a NY strip med/rare with an order of shrimp to go with it. The shrimp was dry and tough and the steak was raw in the middle. Poor Angie had to say that this was their med/rare but it was cold and purple in the middle and I knew that she was just trying to make it seem like it wasn't an error. Funny thing is that my husband ordered his filet medium and it also came out raw in the middle. He just didn't say anything about it. What was most disappointing is that this is supposed to be one of the best places to get a good meal and to get what you pay for and it was just mediocre at best. You'd think that they would know how to prepare steaks to the letter by now. We live here and like to splurge on an expensive meal a few times a year but we won't be going to Ruth's Chris.",

We were told by the hostess there was a wait, despite seeing several empty tables. This was a bit annoying, but we decided to sit at the bar for a drink while we waited. We were greeted by Camacho and he offered that we could order food with him, so we did that. Both he and Josh gave excellent information and made sure everything was on point.   The steaks are cooked at 1800 degrees and served on a 500 degree plate, but start with the crab stuffed mushrooms before rushing to the entree. They were fantastic. Camacho answered numerous questions and made great recommendations on the filet, lobster mac n cheese, wine pairing, and after dinner drink. **Please use a ride sharing service if consuming alcohol**  When dining here, skip the hostess stand and head straight to the bar for top-notch service and an incredible steak!",

I mean REAL good. You will drop at least $150/pp.    The fillet was $56.   I got the lobster tail which was Marketing Price/$100.  It.was.huge.   It could have been slightly less cooked, however, still delicious.  Everyone was sharing their cuts of meat, which are a la cart.  I tasted the Rib eye, fillet, lamb.  All delicious and mouth watering.    The highlight though was the Prisoner wine which was a cabernet blend from californian.  Also, the spicy (not at all) lobster appetizer was my favorite.  Think of the best orange chicken you have ever had, but with lobster!    Highly recommend for an amazing date night or any special night.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Ok, I do not usually do expensive steak houses, but this was my first trip to Las Vegas, and I wanted one really memorable meal if I won any money there.  So after battling the slot machines for about 5 hours, I finally hit a small jackpot and said to myself \"time to celebrate with a good meal.\"   Since the restaurant was right near the casino, I decided to treat myself.  Walking in the door of this place....and the aroma of grilled meat takes over.  Yeah, thank god for cows.   I like New York Strip Steaks, and this one was a nice sized, sizzling steak (yes, you do hear it come to your table, and yes, that plate is hot!).  I also had a loaded baked potato which was the biggest potato I had ever seen.  The steak was a little more done than I wished for, but even so, it was so tender you did not need a knife.  And nicely seasoned, too!  I don't go for sauces.  I want to taste the steak.  This did not disappoint.  But if you want medium, you may be wise to order it medium rare, because my steak did not have any pink in the center.  It may have left the grill that way, but hitting that plate at 500 degrees probably cooked it a bit more.    My only complaint was the salad.  Or should I say the dressing for the salad.  It was rather salty and had an unusual after taste.    Oh well....it is a steak house.  A damn good one, too.  But that chicken that just passed me....well maybe the next trip.  It looked real fine.    Service is very attentive, but not pushy.",

We had a nice window seat where we could see all the people walking between the casinos. We brought our  own wine the cork fee is $35 it is well worth to bring your own. The steak I  order was. the 16 oz Ribeye medium well, this was one good size piece of Steak and was super juicy. The sides we ordered where Au Gratin which is  Idaho sliced potatoes with a three cheese and The grilled asparagus, you can get go wrong with steak and asparagus. We shared the sides cause that how they come you order a plate to share between two, I don't know if it is different if you got more than two people. We. Also got some saute onions on the side on the side. Over all we had a good dinner everything was delicious. The steak was pretty big I almost didn't finish it. Can't wait to visit this place again if not here then one of there other locations.",

This is one of the best parts of dining with Ruth's Chris - the food and service are very consistent.  What makes this restaurant unique is the incredible view of Caesar's Palace across the street.  Be sure to get a reservation and ask / insist they seat you near the windows overlooking the strip.  You won't be disappointed.  The ambiance is very relaxed / romantic, the food is really amazing, and the service is great.  It's expensive, but I think the prices are fair considering its location on the Strip.  Tips:  Try the sweet potato casserole, and the bone-in filet.",

Just for the record the website says they close at 10:00 pm. When I asked why , the hostess said because of lack of business. There was a lack of business because they didn't want to seat anyone at 8:30. The manager Kevin was rude, and while I was leaving , I looked back only to see them laughing at me.

    "text": "DISHONEST and MISLEADING in their advertisement of menu pricing! Shame on Ruth's Chris! I have been a loyal customer to Ruth's Chris for over 10 years! I usually order from their Ruth's Classics/Seasonal Menu where you get a starter, an entree, a side, and a dessert for around $45-55 depending on which entree you choose. I decided to take three out of state guests to dinner for two of my guests' birthdays (two guests were from Kentucky and the other was from California like me). I looked for a Ruth's Chris in the Las Vegas area and found one located in the Harrah's Casino. I then went to the Harrah's website where there was a link that directed me to the Ruth's Chris menu which listed their prices and menu options. The prices listed were consistent to what I had been paying in California which is where I traveled from. When I arrived at Ruth's Chris all was well until we opened the menu and noticed that the Ruth's Chris starter, entree, side, and dessert combos I mentioned above were $83-$94. I thought this obviously had to be a typo since the menu online states different pricing. I asked to speak with a manager. He said that this  was a franchise and that corporate had different pricing. He said he would give us a 10-15% discount but we didn't feel satisfied with that. I then met with Kevin who was apparently over the other first manager we spoke with because he reduced our initial discount offer to only 10%. I explained that we were already seated at the table, I had out of state guests, we were celebrating two birthdays in our party, and I was highly embarrased that I would have to tell them we would need to leave. Afterall they had already started indulging in the bread and were in the process of ordering drinks when our dining experience was abruptly interrupted with the bad news from the manager. He personally came to our table and explained that there was nothing he could do to honor the prices listed on the website and that 10% was his best and final offer. He stated that there were three other incidents within the past couple of weeks where people had the same issue of being misled by False advertisement of menu pricing. They went to the website to check out prices and saw the same cheaper prices I did, not the high prices charged by the Ruth's Chris at this location. There was no evidence of any higher prices listed on any Ruths Chris website and if this particular restaurant wanted to charge higher prices, they should clearly have them posted on the website (or on their virtual menu which literally stands at the entrance of their restaurant) as not to mislead customers.  Also just a little extra background info, I already had a bad feeling about this place. I tried to make a reservation several times earlier in the week and was placed on hold immediately without anyone even saying \"Hello, thank you for calling Ruth's Chris, how may I help you?\" I was placed on hold during one phone call for 20 minutes without anyone even coming back on the phone to check on me. Once I finally was able to get through to someone, I was treated rudely by the person answering the phone to take reservations. My initial reservation was even deleted (Open Table sent me an email saying so) so I had to redo my reservation. I was shocked that this type of behavior is permitted at a 5 star restaurant like Ruth's Chris who honestly should have been willing to make things right being that there are hundreds of competing steakhouses on the Vegas strip vicinity that are awaiting business. My first love Ruth's Chris has been replaced by my new love Old Homestead in Caesar's Palace across the street. We experienced a 5 star dining experience all around! The manager was friendly, accomodating, and even made our birthday experience one that we will never forget. We will be exploring other options and patronizing other steakhouses from now on as Ruth's Chris has really dropped the ball.  I have forwarded my complaint to Ruth's Chris corporate two days ago and have not yet received any feed back or phone call from them.",

We went here at the suggestion of my parents who had visited a few months prior. Since we were in town and not planning on hitting any shows we made a reservation for 6pm on Monday.  As we jumped on the elevator you could immediately smell steak (this is a good thing). We were seated at a table by the window overlooking Carnaval Court.  Our server Matthew came and took our drink order and gave us time to look over the menu. We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  He explained the cooking process of the steak, being someone who loves to cook this was great to hear about.  Once the food arrived the steak was pre cut into pieces. He placed a piece of the filet side and a piece of the strip side on our plates (each 500 degrees) and seared it right there.  The filet melted in your mouth and the strip was just as good.   We followed that up with dessert & coffee. My wife got the cheesecake and raved about it while I had coffee because I wanted to savor the flavor of the amazing dinner.   Is it pricey, yes, but at the same time it's worth every penny.",

I've been to this location about four times. Let me tell you about the last time....  We arrived on time and they took us to our table immediately. They were going to put us in a table in the middle somewhere. I asked if we could sit by the window to see the view of the strip. And, they granted our wish. They came and took our drink order. And, brought out the very delicious bread with soft whipped butter.  I ordered without even opening the menu. I do this to impress whoever I'm with. The crab cakes came out sizzling hot. It's 99% crab, the way it should be. I also love their butter sauce with little pieces of that bell peppers.  My ribeye came out sizzling hot, well done charred, just how I like it. He got a petite fillet which he enjoyed very much. For the sides, we got the creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin and the most delicious sweet potato casserole in the world! I love this place! I have since I was a little girl and I'm sure I will even when I will be in elderly old lady!",

The sauce was so good . For my entree, I ordered the petite filet , medium well , it was also very tasty. The edges were nice and charred. The flavor was perfect . The plate was so hot that the steak was still sizzling . Yum ! We ordered the fire roasted corn and mashed potatoes as sides for the table . The corn had peppers in it so I liked the flavor . The mashed potatoes were not my favorite but they weren't bad .   The service was great. Our waitress was very nice and attentive . There were other staff members that helped us and they were all very good .   The environment was beautiful. We sat next to the window with a strip view . The lighting was dimmed .   If you are looking to have a nice dinner date and looking to splurge a bit ... this is a great place for it .",

It was a Saturday evening, and I was able to walk right in and grab a seat at the bar. The gentleman behind the bar (Hispanic) was seriously amazing. This is the kinda of service you want to give every customer and he is a prime example of great service - I really wish a remembered his name! In addition, the couple who next to me on my left who frequent often confirmed, as well, as the guy to my right who comes down from the bay every so often and all enjoy the service this kind gentleman provides!   Double Scotch on the rocks please! Was the beginning to a great meal that included a Wedge Salad, Cowboy Ribeye (Bone-In) and some Lobster Mac n' Cheese! The steak was cooked to perfection and tasted \"uuhhh Freaken Mazing\"!   Ruth Chris is not just hype; and after this revisit - it was confirmed! Thanks again to the guy behind the bar, I will be returning just based off your service!",

    "text": "I will give my honest review of this location and my experience. I would first like to say I have eaten at this chain from LA to San Diego but pasadena is where I frequented now that I'm in Vegas for two year las we decided to try the one at Harrah's. I informed the waitress when we got there and also with my booking that we were celebrating a newlywed couple and my anniversary. I also asked for separate checks. While she is explaining  the menu I asked here a question and she replied to me \"if you will wait I will answer your question when I'm done!\" Ok when she was done I went to ask and she walked away. Lol forget my question. We moved on to the drinks we all placed and order two of the drink had special instructions 2 of the 4 drinks where perfect. When she came back to ask about the drinks I told her that two weren't right and she said well they are drinking them are they not good? My friends to be polite said the drinks are fine just not what they ordered. Now moving on to the dinner food was perfect cooked to perfection. I asked for some sauce for my crab cake she passed by checked on us 2 times after that and walked by 3 times after I asked for the sauce on there 3rd wall by I told her your forgot my sauce at this time my crab cake was cold and tried of waiting for sauce I didn't eat it. Then finally the bill came it wasn't split like requested so of course for a celebration to end it with having to split up the bill really kills the mood. The worst thing is no acknowledgement of any of the celebrations. The people I brought had never eaten here and was a mediocre experience for them .The service here on my visit sucked enough to make me not want to go back. To the waitress I am sorry we were not the guest you like to serve or I'm sorry you had a bad day at work but when you work in service it should not be pushed on to my experience. I pay for flawless service and amazing food. I fell like when the service is bad it makes the food less appetizing.",

I had the Spicy Lobster, Spicy Shrimp, and Ahi Tuna, which were lovely. The \"spicy\" aspect was quite mild and the sauce was very creamy. If you think paprika is spicy then yes, these dishes were \"spicy.\" The service is upscale and up to par with a typical steakhouse. If you're looking for the personal service and tastes of an upscale restaurant and willing to eat a little early, eat your dinner's worth here at Ruth's.  The food came out very quickly and based on the the service and food quality, I will be revisiting.

I would rate them closer to outback or lone star. I give them high marks for the restaurant. A very nice place to dine. The service was great very attentive to your needs. Where they loose points with me is the food. Flavorless and overcooked. Started with the lobster soup. I make a better lobster soup at home. Very hard to find the lobster and they need to work on the Broth as the flavor was not seafood. They served all dinners on hot plates and they warn you they are very hot. Well they never cool down. I burned my finger when I tried to move my plate. Sorry if hot plates are your signature you need to check the temperature of the plates. The salmon and lambchops may have started out medium and medium rare. However by the time they cooled to the point where we could eat them without burning my mouth they were both over cooked. Also if you notice I received two chops that were two inches thick and one that was 1 inch thick. The one inch cops was over cooked. I will give the pastry chef 5 stars as the deserts were perfect.",

Service was great but the food was not. I had to send my steak back first because it came out medium well and second because it came out raw and barely seared. The third steak came out medium rare as ordered, but was 30% inedible fat. I didn't complain again because by this time, we just wanted to be done. The side of Au Gratin potato was undercooked disappointing, too  Lobster bisque and salad was good. Craft cocktails were really good. Sever and manager were both friendly and attentive.  They did comp our cocktails and tried to make it a good experience.   I wish I could rate the service staff separately from the kitchen.",

The restaurant presents the semblance of a steakhouse without the substance. \"USDA\" certified meat, \"custom\" ovens, fancy pants ambience, but barely passable steak that you could make better yourself at home.  It doesn't help that they seem to value the theatrics of serving the meat on scalding plates, which cook the meat to damnation by the time you're halfway through.  And hopefully you don't get stuck with a pretentious server who seems to insinuate that you haven't ordered enough, even though you're already getting 16 oz ribeye with a bowl of greens.  Splurge a bit more for a better steakhouse, or just go to the pub. Skip Ruth's.",

Day old bread, croutons from the box, microwaved potato, steak that was not only full of ribbons of fat but cooked to the point that it would qualify as charcoal.    A franchisee that should be kicked out of the system if the parent wants to save its reputation.",

The restaurant is very nice and when you go in the evening Fri-Sun most of the people are dressed quite nice so it's a bit awkward to go in jeans and a t-shirt if you're not a teenager/kid. Reservations is a must because they get very crowded and no one wants to wait all night to eat. The food is very expensive. I went with 5 other people and the bill was almost $400 but the food is worth it if you're willing to pay a bit more.",

Ribeye was good, it wasn't $50 good though. Mushrooms lacked any flavor and the bread they serve you when you're seated was a .50 loaf of generic bread. If it wasn't for the pleasant hostess and waiter, I'd give this place like 1-2 stars. Would t go back, simply because the food was not up to par.",

Steaks were good, not great.  Sides were some of the worst sides I've had.  The creamed spinach had a barn flavor to it.  No seriously it tasted just like a barn smells, leave the hay for horses.  Weird.  Also the asparagus came out looking yellow and limp.  The manager came by the table and we told them how disappointed we were in the sides - so he did take 1/2 off.  There are a lot of steak houses in Vegas, so I will be trying a different one next time. (Maybe I've just been spoiled by the excellent steakhouses we have in Denver - where Ruth's Chris just recently closed it's location)",

Perhaps it was the knowledgeable, efficient, humorous, friendly and attentive servers that helped knock this restaurant out of the park, but the food was absolutely on point to say the least. I didn't care that our food and drink bill was upwards of $250! We loved watching the sideshow act going on in the street below our window-side table. Lucky for us that we have a Ruth Chris in our Bay Area city so that we can enjoy it on our next special occasion!",

I was truly shocked at how bad this $50 steak tasted. We got the lobster mac and cheese as a side. The lobster actually squeaked when I chewed it from being so over cooked. Not sure if they actually use a sauce or just melt some cheese over cooked pasta. I was really disappointed cause I've been to other locations and the food was fantastic.

    "text": "My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.  Let me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.  I ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.  We both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.  And what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.  The sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.  As for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.  In summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.  Lastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left.",

They didn't have everything because they were still waiting for approval.  I had crab legs and bone in filet medium rare.  The crab kegs were soft and not too tasty. I didn't enjoy them at all.  The filet came out well done at the first cuts. When I told them I only eat it medium rare, they told me to cut close to the bone, it should be medium rare there. What?? So I throw away 75% of the $67 steak to get what I want. They finally took it, but then brought back a steak rare. Since I don't live here, I couldn't get it to go to cook more at home. They then told me to jet it rest longer so it would cook more. Really?!? It was tender, but little flavor.  The chopped salad was as amazing as ever, but the bakes potato was cold with no little sides for such a big potato.  Someone had the $90 lobster. It was tough, and not worth $90.  I highly recommend Ruth Chris, just not the one in harrahs.",

It closed about four years ago along with the other location on Paradise road.  We visited other locations in New York, Phoenix, 3 in Florida and Savannah.  We go because we know what to expect & are rarely disappointed; until last night.  This was our anniversary, so we decided to brave the Strip and visit the location at Harrah's.  We had visited this location once before & it was fine.  However, last night's visit started fine.  We decided to eat at the bar, which we've done many times at other locations.  Ron, the bartender, was excellent & treated us very well.  My 2 favorite dishes are the lobster bisque & the shoestring fries.  The lobster bisque was just okay.  Not very warm and not very tangy which I had come to expect.  Ordering the shoestring fries, I was informed that it was no longer served at this location.  Ron informed us that many customers from out of town regularly ask for this dish and are disappointed to find it is not offered. I don't understand this.  I checked and it's still on the menu at other location's.  On top of this, we ordered the classic cut fries & they were limp and ordinary.  So, no more Ruth's Chris Las Vegas because you just became ordinary.",

We were seated but before we ordered dinner the waiter advised us that he was being let go for the evening and that someone else would be taking care of us.  From that point forward, we rarely saw any wait or service staff.  Given that the restaurant was so empty there were no service people nearby.  We would have purchased more drinks if we had only been waited on properly.  The food that we got was very good. The timing on the food was off however.  Salads were barely served before the main entrees were delivered.  Drinks had to be asked for several times before they were delivered.  We were told that this particular location doesn't have the shoestring fries because the restaurant is too big and they would get cold before they were delivered to the table; in reality we know now that the fries would get cold because the service was so bad.",

The ambiance was nice for a steakhouse and was on point with other fine steakhouses.   Our main complaints came from the service. We had 2 waiters and a water girl. We were there for a celebration so 2 bottles of champagne were ordered and unfortunately our main waiter tried to pour them over us at the table and managed to spill a decent amount on the table. No other drink orders were ever offered, besides the glass of water everyone gets. We didn't notice at the time because we were having a good group conversation so straight to the steaks.  Our 2 waiters were stuffy and didn't seem very interested in doing a good job. I assume it's because a large group already includes gratuity but it may be incompetence. My steak came out medium when ordered medium rare but was still delicious. Sadly the most inexperienced of the servers, the water girl, was by far the best and most attentive to us throughout the meal.   The pre-steak bread and butter was plain and unimpressive. The sweet potato casserole was excellent, and the only side worth eating of the four we ordered.   With so many viable steak options in Vegas I wouldn't eat here. 4 or 5 star prices require 4 or 5 star service and we ended up getting 1 to 2 star service from our main 2 waiters.",

It was delicious until the frozen crab legs came out.  Three pieces for like 50.00 REALLY?  I ordered my steak med rare and when it sizzled on the plate it was medium almost well.  Just pink.  I still enjoyed the taste and we went on a business dinner, but I had to pay for it I think that I would be upset with the crab legs and the steak. Let's clarify this, I mentioned it to the Donald Bishop the general manager when he casually came by and ask us how everything was.  I told him it was great except for the crab legs he asked why and I told him, based on that I thought he would give us a dessert (even though we couldn't eat another bite).  Instead he thank us for the feed back.  I didn't say it for something it was the truth, but for him to not even just comp it because it was still on the table.  I think for a place like that he could have done somthing about this.  If I am wrong please let me know.  I am a business owner myself and I know customer service is everything.  This was not really customer service to me. He just gave me his card and said to call him for our next visit.  Really what does that mean?  I took a coworker her because she has never been, well I doubt we will be ever back.  Or we have to know we order STEAK not seafood.",

Loved this place, I forgot I was in harrahs during the meal. i only got out like to places like this for special occasions and this place delivered, maybe the service maybe was a little over board, but hey when in rome... The hostess whose name i didnt get was very pleasant, made nice conversation with me on the way to my beautiful table with an amazing view. The service was spot on, I made sure to get there names because they made me feel like a king Soyun and Josh where the ones servicing my meal, they made a great team. The 500 degree plates is a very cool concept, I guess thats their niche.  The food was a bit pricey but nothing too crazy. It is the strip and its Ruth Chris. The place is new and you can tell by the decor they put some serious money into the place, it really added to the experience.",

    "text": "Conclusion: Not worth the price.  The Good:  Delicious sweet potato casserole with pecan crust.  They split our orders onto separate plates. We mentioned it was our anniversary and they gave us a chocolate cake.  The Bad:  Tough steak... dry. Not worth the price!  Staff felt like they were \"trying\" but the True feel of \"fine dining\" was not there. The staff may have been trained, but they just couldn't get the little touches to complete the fine part of fine dining. For example:  - the staff would get into the way while they attempt to pour water.   - Staff would interrupt the conversation to ask their question. I was going to finish my sentence before letting the staff ask their question, but she rudely interrupted.   - We had to ask wait staff to find our waiter to get our check  - They never cleaned the table throughout the appetizers, salad, entrees, etc.  - The items above were all things that the staff in San Diego's Ruth's Chris was very good at. I read a review saying the old business at this Las Vegas location was another steakhouse but Ruth's Chris now has a majority of the staff from that location. If the old staff was not truly capable of \"fine dining\", this Ruth's Chris staff will only bring down the experience of what this restaurant could bring. (Perhap's Ruth's Chris has a contract with Harrah's to use existing staff. . . either way, not a good wait staff for this type of restaurant.)  Cowboy ribeye at San Diego's Ruth's Chris, is my all time favorite. I've had it 4-6 times. This Las Vegas location, seemed like they sourced their steak meat from the buffet. Perhaps Harrah's has a vendor they go through for all the food of all the restaurants inside their property, which would limited Ruth's Chris quality.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying I have eaten at a Ruth's Chris before. I've eaten at the one in Denver and the one in San Diego. This one blew those two out of the water. The service was unlike anywhere I have ever eaten. By far the best service experience I have ever had. Adam was our server and he said he was new to the Ruth's Chris here in Vegas but that he had worked for the company for many years. This definitely showed he answered every question we could come up, we even tried to stump him but to no avail.  He kept us laughing and entertained throughout our entire dining experience.  He was very funny and charming really loved engaging with him.   Now on to the food WOW just WOW. Adam recommended the Spicy Lobster and it was unbelievable. Kind of reminded me of a bang bang shrimp from Bonefish but much better. Then I had the Cowboy Ribeye oscar style and my wife had the filet oscar style. Adam said it was the only way to have a steak with the crab cake and bernaise sauce, and boy was he right. Was easily the best steak i've ever had. Adam also suggested the sweet potato casserole, I'm not even a big fan of sweet potato, but this dish was unbelievable. It was like a desert. My wife and I really enjoyed our experience all in all, we loved Adam and will definitely ask for him when we come in again, as should you. Ruth's Chris really went above and beyond great great experience. Thank you to everyone there. We will be back soon.",

While the decor has been modernized slightly and the kitchen has been totally remodeled, it is apparent that some things still haven't changed.  The waitstaff is still ~75% from the Range.  And it shows.  They are SO SLOW.  It took almost 45 mins for the waiter to come and take our orders.  By the time our entrees came, I was totally over it.  And, he made so many mistakes.  Some people's orders were forgotten.  And he gave us the wrong desserts.  Overall the food is good, but for what you're spending, the service does not make up for it.  Plus, even though it is a steakhouse, since some vegetarian guests are accompanying their friends, it would be nice if they had more non-meat options available.",

This is a beautiful restaurant and with our window seat it was great for eating and people watching.  We were seated right away but it took a little while for our server to take our order.  I had the rib eye steak and my son had the lamb chops, both were great, generous portions.  I understand finishing the steak with butter but this was too much (a bit greasy) for my taste.  We shared the wedge salad, a baked potato and the broccoli au gratin.    Dinner was a bit pricey but occasionally I guess it's okay.  Small problem with the salad course. The server was very attentive and later \"comped\" us a dessert, the chocolate expresso cheesecake - yummy!",

As soon as we exited the elevators, we were greeted right away by 2 gorgeous Hostesses. We were seated right away. Our seating location overlooking the Strip. A pretty awesome view. Our server Josh was very attentive. Cant go wrong with the Surf and Turf, filet and lobster tail. Ohhh and the BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer is awesome especially if you dip your bread in the sauce. Had a great meal and everyone of their staff was very attentive and friendly. Our server Josh even cut and served the cake we brought. Thanks Josh! I love Ruth Chris's experience especially now they are back in Vega$.",

    "text": "Flintstones, meet the Flintstones... This was NOT a Yabba Dabba Doo Time.  We came as a large party to celebrate a 60th birthday and was not impressed at all.  The dino sized sides were under-seasoned and bland.  The 2 inch thick onion rings were soggy and soft, they were served with a watered down unknown sauce that had no business being there.  The \"sauteed\" mushrooms were not only whole mushrooms, but were not so much \"sauteed\" as they were swimming in a pool of unseasoned butter.  The green beans were on steroids.  They were about an inch in diameter and also, yes you guessed it, under-seasoned.  To get to the heart of the restaurant, the filet was ordered medium and was rare on one side and well on the other.  In other words, it was inedible.  It doesn't stop there.  The waiter, while clearly stepping on my foot, as I told him, he spills water all over the table and on me, then walks away.  Assuming he is getting something to clean it up, he comes back empty handed.  When I ask him for some napkins, he rudely tells me, \"Just a minute, ma'am, I am grabbing napkins now.\"  The most aweful experience ever.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of good steak accompanied by good service. As a San Diego resident the service and food at Ruth Chris San Diego is amazing-sadly it was not the case for my Vegas experience. We went a couple of weeks ago for my BF's birthday and I made an online reservation indicating the special occasion. We got there a little late and it took about 5 minutes for us to get seated which we were okay with. Our server seem to be attentive at the beginning but as time progressed we were totally abandoned-he only came to check on us about two-three times after our food was served. We couldn't make up our mind with the drinks and maybe that's what got him frustrated so he decided to go take care of his other tables and forget about us. We ordered the three course meal and while we were still eating our salad the steaks and sides came out which rushed me to finish my salad and my boyfriend had to ask the busser or whoever he was (it wasn't even the waiter) to take the food back, he was not going to rush his salad just because they decided to bombard us with all the food. The steak was alright I guess, somewhat salty but the sides were horrible. I ordered the sauteed mushrooms and creamed spinach, the spinach looked like it was the left over of the day with some butter added and the mushroom consistency was like they weren't sauteed but rather taken out of a bag and just tossed in microwaved melted butter. My point is-the sides tasted like we go the leftovers of the day and maybe we did since we go there at 9 and they close at 10:30. We truly felt rushed throughout our dinner and if you are going to be rushing people then don't take late dinner reservations. I like to be constantly checked on the service needs especially when we are paying for a $200 dinner. He didn't even get a birthday cake like they normally do in SD. If you are going to Vegas and spending that much money on steak I would suggest trying another steakhouse instead-Ruth's Chris service is definitely not the same everywhere.",

There are steakhouses in almost every casino resort on the Strip, but I've found that Ruth's Chris Steakhouse at Harrah's is one of the most consistent and delicious steakhouses in Vegas. The classic ribeye, cowboy ribeye, and filet are all amazing. All cuts are USDA prime grade beef from the Midwest so it's sure to be tender. Don't forget to also treat yourself to an old fashioned, fine scotch or glass of Pinot Noir. Best of all, the wonderful food and drink is brought to you by some of the most pleasant staff in town. Server Dollianne will make you feel like a million bucks even if you didn't win a million at the slots and tables. Be sure to make a reservation;  the dinner service is very popular.",

My friend and I had the fried calamari as an appetizer; it could have been my entire meal.  It was so fresh and the pepper dipping sauce was superb.  Chas even brought out a garlic butter sauce for us to try, which was delicious as well. I ordered the petite filet, with my \"stick of butter.\"  Just the perfect cut, cooked to perfection, it melted in your mouth.  We also split the baked potato (which could have been a meal in itself too!) with all the toppings to choose from. Needless to say, I really enjoyed my meal here...  And, thanks Chas for a good time.  ;)",

    "text": "Located on the second floor of Harrah's, with its own designated elevator, all I can say is this place is over-priced, okay-quality steak, and has poor presentation of food. 2 stars because I've experienced much better!!   I came in with my family (10 people) for a Christmas dinner. Dimly-lit atmosphere, okay service. You can order with a set course meal or just by the plate.   My family started off with calamari and shrimp cocktails. Shrimp cocktails only consist of 4 shrimps per plate but I will admit that the shrimp was a good size. Both were okay.   I started with the lobster bisque which was pretty good. As for the steaks, they are expensive because they are bigger than usual for the size.   I got a 20 oz Ribeye ($50), med/rare and it was juicy! Good at first, but then when I got to the center, it became dry, which started to take awhile for me to chew. They also charge you for sides that you order, so if you only order a steak, that's all you get. Which is why I am saying poor presentation of food. Can't offer a little flower on the side to make it look a little better?   I've had much better steak for cheaper or equivalent prices. I would suggest you guys to go elsewhere if you don't want to get ripped off.   My family ordered the 19 oz filet mignon's and weren't satisfied with the way they cooked it. One was more well done than the other (compared to my parents), and they both got med/rare.   According to my flight attendant, you can get much better steak off the strip at gentleman club's....such as Treasures. I have yet to try though.",

You have to take the elevator up to the second floor which brings you directly to the entrance of the restaurant.    The dining area is huge.  If you are seated along the outside by the windows, they either face the strip or the Quad.  Makes for a good people watching place.   The hostess' were so friendly with helping us to our table.  Immediately we were greeted by our waiter Dominick.  Let me tell you that he was phenomenal!  When you address us by Mr. and Mrs. E the entire evening, that gets you extra props in my book!   He was polite and so attentive for our dining experience.  It was greatly appreciated!  On to our dinners~  Yum!  I had the Chilean Seabass topped with Crab and Lobster with Hollandaise.  If I wasn't so full from the delicious lobster bisque, I'd want more!  It was cooked to perfection.  The sea bass was light and perfect.  I wouldn't change one thing about it.  I also had the creamed spinach on the side which complimented the meal delightfully!  My husband had the petit filet with grilled shrimp.  Again, perfect! Of course I had a taste of it..  so tender and delicious! He had the potatoes au gratin on the side.  Yep, they were fabulous!  I don't know how many more adjectives I can use to describe how wonderful our meals were.  Our evening here was so enjoyable and I can't wait to come back.  Thank you Dominick and Ruth's Chris!",

Finally my good friend and I went to the only one in town which is of course is inside Harrah's.   We lucked out and got a window table and had a beautiful view of the strip.  The main reason why I wanted to leave a review is not only was the food wonderful (which it was) it was the service that stood out,  Our waiter, Jeff Wise, was just wonderful.  Extremely nice, personable, knowledgeable and patient.  It's the type of service I expect when one goes to a top flight restaurant.  There are a lot of times that does not happen.  The servers at some of the restaurants on the strip can be not nice, snooty even.  No I'm not a millionairess (not yet:) but it's still my hard earned money I am spending and I want the full experience of dining at a lovely restaurant and Jeff gave us a wonderful experience.",

So we ordered the set menu but their steak tasted very good like Hillstone and LB steak. Ruth is one of famous steak houses in US, thus they are actually right option to eat steak in Las Vegas. However I decreased one star out of 5 stars because of price. Of couse their service meant price but in general it should be difficult for families to eat set menu for three or four.",

My boyfriend was so excited and happy and told the hostesses that it was his Birthday and none of them even said \" Happy Birthday\". Then we were prompted to our table. The table was unstable and was shaking. We didn't say anything. Then it took a while for a bus person to bring us water I would say 15-20 minutes. At that point we haven't even seen our waiter. We finished water, our bread and the waiter still didn't show up. Nobody refilled our water, we even spilled one glass because the table was shaking and nobody even noticed. Then we asked a bus person to call a waiter for us and still nothing. Then we asked a photographer to call a manager. The manager came his name was Anthony he apologized and said he would take care of us. By the way when manager came our waiter showed up after 30 minutes; at that point we told him we didn't need him. So it took them 30 minutes to take our order. And guess what after the manager took our order, the food came out and the order was wrong. And we were for real now? Even the manager can't take an order at such expensive and high-end restaurant? He took our order and it was wrong!!!! If you charge customers high $$$$ please provide a good customer service. And make sure your managers know what they are doing and not just the name \"a manager\". There are plenty fancy restaurants on the strip with tasty food and superb service!!!!! Don't waste your money and time on this steakhouse. Not worth it....  We are locals and definitely will not come back to this restaurant....",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for our anniversary, and we'd heard the hype, so we decided to try it. I ordered the filet, and it was a bit dry--I admit, it was probably cooked the way I ordered it, but it was dry regardless. My husband ordered the ribeye, and on his first bite, he bit into a piece of bone! I literally heard the crunch, and this is supposed to be a boneless ribeye! He hurt his tooth, and told our waitress when she came by. She informed the manager, who came out to speak to us. My husband showed him the piece of bone, and he offered to prepare him another steak. He declined, since we had a show that night and didn't have time to wait. My husband kept eating it, but he didn't really get to enjoy it, as he was worried about it happening again. When we got the bill, we were a bit disappointed to see there was not even a little bit of discount offered for that. My husband left a note on the back of the receipt, expressing his disappointment, and the manager ended up calling us. He told my husband he had planned to take the price of the steak off the tab but hadn't had a chance to relay that to our waitress. He told him he'd see two transactions on his bank account: the original dinner bill and the refund of the steak. Never happened. For a restaurant so high dollar, you'd think they could do better. The food was decent but due to the service, we won't be back",

None, zip, zilch!  Then after several of the guests ordered the porterhouse for two ($105) the server knocks over a guests glass of wine and spills it into the porterhouse of another guest. I find out after the dinner that the kitchen only re-plated the meat leaving it wine soaked. I was shocked to see this level of really awful service at a Ruth Chris and hope it is not just what they have come to. I've eaten at RC in many cities around the US and have always thought they had the best steak around but I've got to say that even setting aside the bad service the filet I bought was just so-so. Afraid it's just not the RC of yesteryear.",

She was very engaged and detailed and he was just blah. There was no pass of or even a mention of a change in waiter. The new waiter didn't even introduce himself or even ask what we were drinking. He assumed that my husband was drinking Pepsi when it was actually root beer but he charged us for the drink he mistakenly brought out as well as the correct drink but I didn't even say anything; although I should have.

At an establishment like Ruth Chris, I don't mind spending a few extra $$ for a nice glass of wine. I didn't feel that they had too many options. Otherwise, everything was fantastic.",

We made our reservations the same day for eight and we did not have any problems getting a table. We showed up at our reserved time and was seated a few minutes later. The restaurant is really nice, dimly lit and looks out over the strip.   I ordered (as did most of my party) the three course special. I want to say it was $69 for what I got, which was lobster bisque as a starter, the 8oz filet as the entree with sweet potato casserole as the side, and the chocolate sin cake as dessert. You have a choice for appetizer, entree, and side, but not dessert.  We got some complimentary bread with butter at first. With the appetizer, those of us of drinking age shared a bottle of delicious white wine. The lobster bisque was very good, and pretty filling. Next the steak and the side came out (note about the sides: they are big enough to share with another person, and are not included with the entree - with the three course special a choice of side is included), along with a bottle of red wine that we had ordered, at the waiter's recommendation. The plates are very, very hot. Of course, one of the kids with us immediately grabbed both sides of her plate to move it over, and burnt herself. She was fine, but upset and one of the waiters came over with ice and joked around with her a little. Nice touch! The steak was very good, and I am not a big meat person. The sweet potato casserole was way too sweet as a side, and I would recommend the mashed potatoes instead which my brother got. Too big of a side for one too. The kids with us are huge eaters, and one actually finished their steak which I couldn't do! The waiter was delighted.  It was my opinion, as well as my family's, that having the chocolate sin cake for dessert was too much. The meal itself was very filling, and it would have been much more fitting to serve a sorbet or something else light at the end. As it was, I ended up so full I felt sick.  Everything was delicious, but portions could be scaled down for the three course special as it was way too much food. Our main waiter was fantastic, and incredibly polite. We all enjoyed our meal and the experience.",

Oddly, the flavor I remember most is the nuked rubbery seaweed flavored shrimp resting atop such a beautiful cut of roast beast. The salad and sides were good, but not memorable. Same w the creme brulee.  Unfortunately, I can't find a True hero in the Ruth's Chris experience. There's nothing I can say about this place, be it the vibe, service or food that justify the price. Especially since you can, (with a quick Google-search and some tenacity), learn how to make a steak surpisingly comparable to Ruths for 1/2 the cost. If you know this, you walk away feeling a bit duped, even a little angry.   The server's had sold me on the fact that the beef we were about to eat is the top 3% in America. In all fairness to Ruth, there's simply no way to give the time and attention required to make every steak great and pump them all out in a night. Ruth knows you don't understand this. Thats why they've got you in their restaurant. The guy sitting next to me got the most expensive cut on the menu (the $100 cowboy ribeye) and offered me a bite (It damn near burned my mouth it was so hot.) The number 1 food crime in America is not letting your steak rest before served. How could u do this to a man who just paid $100 bucks for a slice of cow? And I hate saying this but it tasted so damn....average. Not even half as good as the $27 ribeye I got at Pappy's way out in the desert.   After all the great things I've heard Ruth. We gotta talk.",

I even got to collect Total Rewards Points on the meal.  I'm shocked we didn't eat here every night.   Disappointed no one offered my boyfriend dessert since it was his actual birthday and I must have mentioned it the staff at least twice. I'm not going to dock stars for that, because we were too full for dessert.",

We had an 8pm reservation and when we arrived we were seated right away. The service was excellent and our waitress was a doll. The atmosphere here is very romantic. I would suggest making a reservation to avoid waiting a long time. The food was fantastic!! I started my meal with the crab cake appetizer and let me tell you baby that crab cake was all crab. The best crab cake I've had in a long time. We both had the Rib eye with grilled asparagus, loaded bake potato & onion rings all to share. The portions are huge here so you can share all sides if you want. We also had a complimentary bottle of wine which completed this magnificent meal. At the end of our meal we were given two delicious desserts with Happy Anniversary written on it. It was a beautiful experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for steak. We will for sure be returning here on our next trip back to Las Vegas.",

Lucky for me we were in front of Harrah's.  Walked right in and had the best experience at a RC yet.  Way to go folks in Vegas.    Locations I have eaten at are:  Annapolis, Atlantic City, Anaheim, DC (don't go to that one), San Francisco, San Diego, Orlando (thought the folks there were a little racist), Chicago (there are better steak houses than RC in Chicago), St. Louis, Midtown NYC, Charlotte, PDX and Seattle to name a few.  Business trips are nice for eating at good restaurants.  Don't like to give out 5-stars as the establishment can't go up from there.  But in this case it was deserving.",

You just can't beat a Ruth's Chris steak, and this location was no exception. My ribeye was killer. The scallops on the menu caught my eye, but I couldn't bring myself to order them in lieu of steak, so the waiter let me add a side of them! They were perfectly seasoned and seared. Probably the best steak and the best scallops I've ever had.  Our drinks and sides were good, as always. They brought a beautiful chocolate dessert for our anniversary.  Our service was legendary! Our waiter made appropriate recommendations and was quick to serve us, but not too chatty so we could enjoy an intimate meal. WHEN I return, I will ask to be seated by the windows so we can have a better view of the strip.",

My recommendation to anyone reading this review is to goto craft steak house in the MGM.  If it wasn't for us being in Harrah and it being a little late for dinner we would not have gone - but I figured \"it's Ruth Chris\" so I knew it would be at the very least a good meal.

    "text": "This Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is the busiest of all of their many locations (if I heard it explained correctly).  It is located inside Harrah's casino, and has a beautiful view (especially in the evening) of the Las Vegas Blvd and The Forum Shop across the street from the bar and most of the dining area.  To get to the restaurant look for the pair of elevators with the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse signage nearby. If you can't locate it,I am sure one of the Harrah's staff will be happy to provide direction or perhaps even escort you there.  (Disclaimer)  I was at this Ruth's Chris Steakhouse recently for a private function, therefore I will primarily limit my comments on the service, food, and overall dining experience.  First, the decor and overall ambiance was very pleasant.  The lighting is dim, not conducive to food photography (unless you have really good camera gears that are capable of low light photography), as you don't want to disturb other guests with your flash photography.  But the view of the Strip and automobiles and pedestrians below is almost hypnotic.  (4.5/5)  The staff that waited on us were a good group.  Rene our server was exceptional, and was knowledgeable about the menu, including details not printed on the menu, as well as the trivia about the oven temperature for preparing steaks (1,800 degrees) and warming the plates that the steaks and most other entrees are served on (500 degrees for the plate, so don't get burn).  (5/5)  Highlights of their menu:  Cowboy (USDA Prime Beef Bone-In) Ribeye.  If you love a good steak cooked to your desired doneness, they have excellent steaks.  Portion size is 22 oz, including the bone.  Caesar Salad:  Very common in most restaurants, but they prepared a really good one here.  (4.5/5)  Seafood Gumbo.   A milder version of the gumbo that will suit the palette of most guests. I personally like my seafood gumbo with more kick, at least from the Andouille sausage and seasoning.  (3.5/5)  Barbecued Shrimp.  Used barbecue spices in the sauce (which is very delicious and would go great with the breads from the bread basket), but the Jumbo Gulf shrimp is sauteed not grilled.  (4.5/5)  Sweet Potato Casserole.  Of the sides we ordered (French Fries, would be better if it was double fried or more crispy; Creamed Spinach, no complaints; Potatoes Au Gratin, no complaints), the Sweet Potato Casserole was the only one we completely finished.  It is sweet, has a nice crunchy crust, and I liked it with my entree, but could also enjoy it as a substitute of their normal dessert options.  (5/5)  Banana Cream Pie.  Generous portion, easily shared with 2-4 dining companions, if you even have room to spare after a steak dinner.    Overall, everyone at the table was extremely happy with the service, food and had a blast.  5 stars!",

I wasn't sure why they couldn't seat us at our requested time. Having said that.... the service was good and the food was excellent. The spicy lobster appetizer was AMAZING!!!!! Love Love Love!!!!!! We ordered a second one after inhaling the first one in record time. I had the Ruth's chopped salad which I didn't care for..... it was more like cold slaw than a salad.....The dressing was so heavy and creamy.... or should I say mayonnaiseeeeeee it completely overwhelmed the flavor of any vegetables lying beneath! I had the veal osso buco ravioli as my entree and it was delicious! Ravioli stuffed full of shredded tenderer meat and mozzarella with a fabulous white wine demi glace and they brought warm, fresh bread.... YUM!!! My husband had the bone-in filet... he devoured it. Was not crazy about the lobster mac and cheese, have had better elsewhere, there sides are a little lacking, Entrees are great , and you definitely can't go wrong with about everything on the appetizer menu!!",

We started with the BBQ shrimp and it was very tasty. Hubby chose the rib eye and I had the petite filet, both were excellent, flavorful and tender. For sides, we had the mashed potato and asparagus with hollandaise - delicious. For desert, we shared a flourless chocolate cake, the perfect end to a nice meal.

The waiter had no desire to wait on us.  Then the food.  The only thing that was cooked properly was the filet.   My lamb chops were all fat and literally thrown on the plate.  No presentation to be found on either plate.   The side potatoes au gratin weren't cook.  Crunchy potatoes!  Yum!  The creamed spinach was laden with red pepper.  Hello?   What a waste of our time and money.  One star given for the view of the scantily-clad girls in front of Harrahs.  At least we had entertainment.",

    "text": "Shared a VDay dinner with my other half at Ruth's Chris last night.  I wasn't super excited to go, as there are a ton of other unique joints in Vegas, but I can't pass up a great steak.  This review will be rather short as the bartenders are very generous with their pours here, making the remainder of my evening a little blurry.  My boy ordered a Balvenie Doublewood on the rocks and was basically given a pint for the same price.  With all the generosity, I'm sure we were the loudest and happiest couple in the entire restaurant.  Or maybe the most annoying, whatevs.  Haters gonna hate.  The restaurant is all windows and has a killer strip view.  The bar wasn't overcrowded or too loud and has a nice booth area to hang out in while waiting to be seated.  Starting with the hostess to the server (Tina) - everything service wise was excellent.  The steaks are magically delicious and cooked to perfection.  It's like they douse their steak in butter.. hence magically delicious.  You have to appreciate a steakhouse that knows EXACTLY what medium rare should look like.    Pricey but worth it for a special occasion due to the food and atmosphere... and, well, the generous bartenders.",

    "text": "This is my first attempt at writing a review as I'm eating, which is maybe that's the best compliment I can give; this place has motivated me to provide my real-time opinion. So far, everything has been excellent. The spicy lobster and seared ahi tuna appetizers are two cant-go-wrong selections.   (And so much for my real time opinion, which may be the \"second\" best compliment I can give. When my steak arrived my primal instincts switched to EAT and my opinion took a back seat.)   So now here I am several days later and I'm still completely impressed with this meal. I've known about Ruth's Chris for a long time and have heard nothing but great things but honestly because it's a chain, I sort of shrugged it off. I'm just more of a hidden gem kind of guy. Thankfully I ventured out of my box and into the private elevator at Harrah's that leads to the beautiful view belonging to Ruth's Chris. Unfortunately, we didn't get to soak in the view but that was actually fine with me. We showed up with no reservations during a busy March Madness weekend and were able to sit and eat immediately at the bar, which was great (bartenders always make the best servers.) After finishing our appetizers, I had a baked potato, the bone-in New York steak (a.k.a. \"The distraction\") and the banana cream pie. The baked potato was standard but the steak was amazing and big enough to feed two, easy. The banana cream pie, unlike the potato, was far from standard and is a must try for banana cream and non-banana cream fans alike. I'm a huge fan but my brother is not and we both loved it.  Try it or Diet Final Word  There is no dieting on this one. Must try!",

We went all out with a couple cocktails, seafood tower and filets all around.    A $480 bill rounded out the evening.  So we spared no expense... The food was very good as we all enjoyed our meals. Our issue was my wife started to not feel well about 2 hours after our dinner.    Which followed with the next 24 hours of awful food poisoning.   She could not even keep water down.    My son and I felt fine so it was easily determined it was the seafood gumbo she had for her starter and we did not.   She did mention it had a odd taste but enjoyed the fact it was full of seafood.    Unfortunately it was really disappointing as she missed the next two days of our planned events.   I called and notified The manger immediately and he was initially very apologetic and said he would Inform the chef.   He also told us we could file a complaint with security.   We did not feel the need to file any paperwork as it would require an Uber trip back to Harrah to do so.    My unhappiness comes from the managers lack of follow up.   He said he was going to call us back and check in the next day.   No call... said he would Comp the meal with a gift certificate,  must be in the mail.   NOT!  We have called 3 more times leaving messages.  No calls back...  Lots of amazing restaurants in Vegas.  Skip this one!",

When we arrived (30 minutes late due to traffic) we were seated at a table with a great view of the strip and our table had rose pedals on it in celebration of our anniversary.  We were quickly greeted by Angie who called us by our last names which was a nice touch.  Her assistant (name started with an A) was EXTREMELY  helpful and VERY funny. We really enjoyed his sense of humor. We split everything except for the steak and we were not made to feel bad about it.  We had...  Cowboy Ribeye Petit Filet  Cesar Salad - split and it was enough for two people (ask for anchovies) Baked potato - split and it was enough for two, my husband just wanted butter but Angie brought the 'loaded part' on the side for me  Dirty Absolut Martini for me  We were surprised when Angie brought us a cheese cake on a plater that had Happy Anniversary written on it - Free  Our total bill was $179 and with a 20% tip came out to $211  We didn't over eat by getting two many sides and we could not have been more happy with the service that was provided.  The manager came to our table and asked how everything was which was a nice touch.  If you are celebrating something special I highly recommend Ruth's Chris in Las Vegas.",

The only bad thing I could say about this place is its location. The restaurant is in Harrah's Hotel and Casino. After parking your car in a ghetto-looking parking structure, you had to walk through one of these dinosaur-like casino. The casino is so old and smelly. I am not snotty person by any means but when you walk by people with orange hair, women covered with tattoos from head-to-toes in a see-through dress, a skin-head with tattoos all over his face, etc., you have to wonder why this restaurant is here. After walking through the entire casino, you take a small elevator up to the 2nd floor to find yourself in the restaurant. Weird!  Having said that, the restaurant is wonderful. The view from our table was of Las Vegas Blvd. The service was decent. Our waiter was a 50-ish YO guy who was a bit impersonal but polite. The food was wonderful as expected. I wish Ruth's Chris would relocate to a better location like Morton's or Lawry's.",

I ordered the ribeye with frenchfries and sweet potato casserole. I know, I know, 2 starches but my wife love the casserole and I wanted fries Don't judge. We also ordered green beans, or hericot verts, happy?  Food came and fries were not cooked. Raw in the middle, so we sent them back and they came back... burnt. No visit from manager, and we ate the crispy fries. You can't make a French fry? For 99 cents I can get delicious fries a high school kid cooked at Mickey Ds and get $11 fries? Not so much. Steak was cooked perfectly. Wife had filet and it was also cooked perfectly. Casserole was awesome. Green beans were crisp. Love RC but this one? Meh",

If you don't like BUTTER then don't dine here.  The steak is served on a 500 degree hot plate with butter.  Since I dine at a lot of different locations, my go to are:   Harvest Salad BBQ Shrimp Seared Ahi Tuna Rib Eye Steak Lobster Tail And a handful of sides  Came here on Thanksgiving Day 11/24/16.  Our server was very nice and took care of us very well.    The ambiance is beautiful, the company was the best and the view was amazing.",

Jessica has been attentive to our table. Checking in after we received our cocktails, after we received our app.    When our meal arrive, we had a filet split and when Jessica saw the middle and noticed it wasn't cooked to what we ordered she said without asking us that she would get it fixed. I've never experience a server taking that initiative to get your order correct without you asking to have it fixed.  Overall the experience was good not great so that's why it wasn't a 5 star rating but I would recommend this place to others based on the service alone.",

I had the shrimp cocktail, bone in filet, and sweet potato casserole.  The shrimp cocktail and steak were both good.  At the time, I felt like the quality was not quite good enough to justify the price, but I did enjoy it.  Looking back, I have been hankering another steak ever since.  The full meal with 2 beer and a bottle of water was $143.  I had leftover steak and sweet potato for breakfast.  The sweet potato casserole had a 1/4 inch crust of brown sugar on top.  I liked it, but it was a bit on the sweet side for me.",

First off, they were severely undercooked and very fatty.  We sent them back to only them put them under the broiler.  It was now overcooked like jerky.  Why they didn't prepare a new plate of chops, I will never know.  I typically will not send a dish back to the kitchen twice.  I simply will not eat it, nor will I order anything else from the kitchen at that point.  With all of the high end steak houses in Las Vegas, they need to do a better job.",

However, I'd say that the steak itself was subpar. Took my mother and younger brother. The filet mignon that my mother got was good, but the ribeye and ny strip that my brother and I got were  not worth it. They were both drowned in a lake of butter. Way, way too much butter. Especially for the ribeye, which is already a very well marbled cut if meat. Just made it too fatty and oily to enjoy.",

It was not a good cut, by the time I had given up trying to eat it there was a pile of bit that I just couldn't eat (I do eat steak fat). That can happen I guess but almost worse was the $12 baked potato.  It was served cold so cold the butter wouldn't melt.  So cold the sour cream didn't warm up.  I tried the filet my wife ordered and it was not great either. She ordered creamed spinach, I'm not a fan so I didn't have any. She said it was OK.

Our reservation was for 5 right when they opened and there was a line of people also trying to get a table. Everyone else was sat and we were left waiting for about 10 mins to be sat. They had some beautiful views from the dining room with large windows but I guess they don't take into consideration who makes reservations and who just stumbled in for dinner because we were tossed in the middle of the restaurant while window seats were left empty or others that came in after us were sat. Anyway, the service we received from Patrick was extremely subpar. It really seemed like we were put on the back burner. He took our order, checked on us once, and then we were just kind of on our own. My boyfriend and I shared the porterhouse for two and we were extremely disappointed. The New York cut was so fatty and chewy it was difficult to eat, the plate they gave me with garlic butter appeared to have sat a while as most of my butter was cooked off, and we ordered our meat rare and it was definitely over cooked. The only thing Patrick took the time to explain was they are the \"number one Ruth's Chris in the world\" which sadly is not True. We are regulars at the Roseville location and everything about our visits are truly an experience from start to finish. I've never been disappointed in any aspect. Unfortunately the Las Vegas location isn't counting on return customers as it is widely a tourist community and are simply relying on the \"Ruth's Chris\" name to pull in diners. They really need to re-evaluate what they are doing there because it's an embarrassment to the label.",

    "text": "I came here for a 50th birthday celebration.  The service was a little extra special.  Now I'm not sure if it's because our waiter thought my friend was Trisha Yearwood or if the service is just really that great.  Ha ha   This location is really nice and classy.  Has a view to accompany the classy feel.  With all the fancy hotels in Vegas I would have never guessed I would find Ruth's Chris in the Harrah's hotel.    Seriously, I've been to the Beverly Hills location and the service is always great so I'm sure it would be great even if the waiter didn't think he was serving a star.  There was a second waitress who came to assist and he shooed her off and said he could handle our group of 12 alone.  Wow, he did just that. Even with one, the service did not slack and he stayed on beat. (I'm very unhappy, I have forgotten his name)    The food...well if you have never eaten at Ruth's Chris you must.  The lobster mac, and the sweet potato casserole are really heaven to your palette.  The BEST part, this is a steak house.  So order the bone in at medium or medium well (please don't char your steak with well done), and you will be satisfied with this wonderful food party. To wash everything down you can have one of their cocktails that will not disappoint either. Hands down, still the best steak I have ever had comes from Ruth's Chris.",

    "text": "These were the items we ordered:   11 oz Filet with shrimp - very buttery and tender overall. Good size overall.   16 oz Ribeye - tender, but I have to say we make better ribeye at home. If you come here, get something you don't normally cook for yourself. Like the filet.   Mushroom - butter soup. I think that sums it up.   Calamari - great flavor, but I wish I had known that it was in a glaze. It almost tasted like a sweet & sour calamari. Perhaps the menu said something about the glaze, but I didn't fully read it. I probably should have.   Garlic mashed potatoes - very buttery. Can't say it was super delicious.   Overall, it was a fun experience because we were in Vegas. Would I come here again? Maybe. But definitely order something different.",

Darcel was our waitress and she was a pleasure to have and was a very positive soul that we needed after a bad experience prior in the evening.  I had the 16oz ribeye which was cooked to perfection and comes out sizzling on a super hot plate.  You can hear and see the steak sizzling before your eyes.   For sides I had the potatoes au gratin which were delicious and the cream spinach.  The restaurant is filled with classy classical music but it's not too loud that you can't hear each other.  If dining for 2 I'd recommend getting a seat by the window to get a view of the strip.  It's pretty a cool site in the evening.",

Btw I got one ny steak $70 does not include anything.

RUDE, AMBIVALENT, ARROGANT, NOT ATTENTIVE.  It's as if he is bothered to do his job. It took nearly 30 minutes for him to take a drink  order, he was shocked we wanted to order wine. And seemed surprised we had any food or beverage knowledge at all. I actually heard him cackle at us. When we ordered our food we had to wait 20 minutes before he could find a wine list for us to review.  The entire section was laughing at his attitude.  His poor back waiter was trying so hard to clean up after his horrible manners, there was actually a whole group behind us that began openly mocking him. Seriously. You spend  $300 on dinner for 2 and you have to put up with this prick? Waiters in Paris are more gracious.  We will come back because we like the bar, the food but RUN if you see this guy.",

I was with my friends and my boyfriend just last sunday to eat dinner and we were assigned to this server named Jessica. At first, she was still okay getting our orders until the time that she asked me what i want. Now since my boyfriend and i will be sharing a big streak, i ordered a calamari and she asked me, \"is this your meal?\". WHAT THE HECK! Why would she ask me if that was my meal? That isnt right. Who cares what i wanna order! So i just let it go. My friend ordered a three course meal. The soup came and then the steak. And then she stopped serving us. The mashed potato which should be with the steak never came until we got the attention of another server and this other server got it for us. Jessica never even bothered to check on us if we are ok. As far as i can remember, if you are a server, you need to ask if everything is okay. Now come on! This is an expensive place! We have to pay our money's worth by having a nice meal with a good service. And still, we kept our cool. We looked around for Jessica and she was only serving like 2 tables and it wasnt even a busy night. I called her to ask for another bread. Guess what? It never came. And then the dessert which should be included with the three course meal? NEVER CAME. So we decided to just pay and ask her for our bill. We called her for it and waited and waited... NEVER CAME. This is really a bad service among all the restaurants that i have dined. And this server is not really happy with her job. We have no choice but to talk to the manager. My friend talked to the manager...(too bad, i forgot his name) but he was really nice to us. He kept on apologizing and even gave us a discount and had our dessert as \"to go\".   The food was not something to really rave about. But the mashed potatoes were really good. The steak was tender and good as well. The only complaint i had was the bad server named Jessica so if any of you want to eat at this place in Vegas, please ask for another server if they will give you Jessica. I saw the manager talking to her and yet she never came to our table to apologize.   I would still recommend this place for the food... just because the manager was nice. They better hire good servers... not the jessica type...",

Only one mark down is her steak was a little more on the well side then she liked but service excellent,  food  great but just the one fumble was not enough for me to take off a star. Been to RC in Walnut Creek ,SF and SD  so I know the service here is on or above where it is any other ones I've  been to. Glad this was our choice as an ending to our trip. Thanks Ruth Chris",

Top notch service, absolutely incredible food, and a great atmosphere.   One tip, even though other entrees (like seafood) look very enticing, go with the filet. It's what they're known for and unbelievable. One of the best I've had.",

I ordered a 16oz ribeye medium +. The bartender explained the chef would understand and medium + is not a problem. When I received my steak it was more well so the bartender agreed to replace it. When my new steak came it was no longer a ribeye but a Porterhouse. I asked a different bartender what type of steak is on my plate? He said he would look on my oder to see. I asked him not to look at my order but tell me. He literally didn't know. He then guessed it was a ribeye. I advise it look d and taste like a Porterhouse. I'm not sure why they decided to give me a Porterhouse instead of a ribeye but I was very, very disappointed in the service and wrong steak I received. I'm been eating ribeyes from Ruth Chris forever and what I received was a Porterhouse. If I'm spending $89 on a steak it should be the correct one. Beware of this Ruth Chris.",

The waiter, Patrick, was attentive and paid attention to our meal selections and help with recommendations. Our table was next to the window overlooking the walk-way, but we had a great time people watching. Everything was great from our arrival to our departure - I will be back again soon!",

Very funny and attentive not to mention extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  I started with the spicy lobster appetizer which Dora said was her favorite appetizer on the menu. It was amazing. It was so good in fact that I almost cancelled my steak and just ordered two more portions of the spicy lobster.  I also had the Harvest Salad which was quite tasty as well. One of the better dinner salads that I have ever had.  For dinner I had the Filet Mignon. It was 11 ounces and quite good, although I will say that it was under cooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). It was also just a little chewy. I have had better cuts at other restaurants, but it was still good and I still finished it.  On the side I had the loaded baked potato which I split with someone else. Again, it was good, but I have to admit that I have had better. Morton's baked potatoes put the Ruth's Chris potatoes to shame, but it was still good.  Oh, I almost forgot, our dinner also came with this amazing French bread. It was warm and soft and all kinds of awesome.   After dinner we were absolutely stuffed, so I can't comment on the desserts. I will add that this location (which is inside Harrah's Casino) has a really nice view of the strip, especially Caesar's Palace.  Overall it was a fantastic dining experience. It is not cheap, so be prepared to spend some cash, but it is definitely worth it.",

We told him that we were and he walked away to bring menus. He never once mentioned that it was happy hour. Luckily we knew and requested a happy hour menu. As a reminder, there were three of us and he brought ONE happy hour menu. We had to ask him to bring us water and he never checked on us at all while we ate. We spoke with the manager in regards to the horrible service that we were receiving from Brian and her response was \"I'll have a talk with him.\" Worst customer service we have ever had.

Our waitress was SoYon a korean lady who was so helpful and friendly and never over monitored the table. We had the three course meal and started with the steakhouse salad with the house vinaigrette, then the 16oz ribeye cooked medium with a perfect pink center and had the most amazing mashed potatoes on earth and the pecan candied sweet potatoes. Then to top off the evening, we ended it with the sinful flourless chocolate cake. Everyone was so friendly and it was just a great evening all around.
